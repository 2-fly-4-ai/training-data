weight benches,"<h2>FAQs on weight benches</h2><h3>How do I adjust the weight bench?</h3><p>Each bench will be operated differently. Many use spring-loaded pins to secure the bench and seat into position, while some use a notch and bar for convenience. Make sure to read the owner's manual to learn how your bench operates.</p><h3>What muscles/exercises can I work on using a weight bench?</h3><p>You can work your full body with any weight bench. I strongly encourage finding credible sources or coaches to help you learn how to use a bench to the maximum.</p><h3>Does the bench's weight capacity include my body weight?</h3><p>Yes! It is important to remember this when picking a bench. If your bench has a maximum capacity of 600 pounds and you weigh 200 pounds, the maximum weight you could safely lift would be 400 pounds. Lifting more than the weight capacity could have dire consequences.</p><h3>Can I do bench presses on the weight bench?</h3><p>Yes, this is one of the primary purposes of a weight bench. Note of warning: ensure you have a proper racking system if you plan to use a barbell. Otherwise, you should stick to bands or dumbbells.</p><h3>Can I do decline bench press on the weight bench?</h3><p>Yes, if your bench has a decline setting.</p><h3>Should I buy a flat bench or an adjustable one?</h3><p>This comes down to personal preference. Flat benches are great options, but adjustable benches give you more variety of exercises you can do.</p><h3>What is a foldable weight bench?</h3><p>This is a bench that can fold up for convenient storage.</p><h3>How padded should my bench be?</h3><p>Your bench should have enough padding that you don't feel the metal frame pressing into you. Avoid overly plush or soft benches as they won't offer you a stable platform for lifting.</p><h3>Why use a weight bench?</h3><p>Bodyweight workouts can only get you so far. Eventually, you'll need equipment or weights to achieve results. Using a weight bench allows you to increase your volume, intensity, and variations for your workouts.</p><h3>How much should I bench for my weight?</h3><p>How much someone benches will vary drastically depending on the person's body style, metabolism, gender, and even fitness goals. A solid goal for novice lifters would be to be able to lift the same as their body weight.</p><h3>How to improve bench press weight?</h3><p>One of my favorite programs is the 5/3/1 progressive program as it darn near guarantees results. That being said, there are tons of programs out there for the bench press that could help you blast through plateaus and PRs.</p>"
backpacking meals,"<h2>FAQs about backpacking meals</h2><h3>Why are backpacking meals important?</h3><p>As you journey into the wilderness, whether it's a casual nature walk or a grueling excursion, you need sustenance to fuel yourself; carbs for energy and protein for muscles, etc. Backpacking and hiking meals will provide all of that in a delectable package to ensure you don't get sluggish from hunger out on the trail.</p><h3>How much do backpacking and hiking meals cost?</h3><p>Most meals cost between $10 and $15, with our Best Value winner at $8 to $9 per pouch. Large variety packs are available, mostly running between $120 and $150 per bucket (usually 12 pouches). Military MREs ring in at $40 to $50 for a four-pack and are really for those desperately hunting for that chili mac and cheese spread.</p><h3>How are backpacking and hiking meals prepared?</h3><p>Prepackaged camping food is as mind-numbingly easy to prepare as can be. Do you have hot water? Perfect, you're done. Pour the recommended amount into the pouch, let it stew in its own flavors for the recommended time, and ta-da. MREs include heaters activated by water to warm food while also including beverage mixes, snacks, and toiletries.</p><h3>Are there breakfast items available for morning adventures?</h3><p>You bet your sweet bippy there are. While less common, there are plenty of breakfast items for morning treks, with some companies offering more or less variety. Oatmeal and granola are the most common dishes sold in stores, but breakfast skillets with eggs, veggies, and meats are also available.</p><h3>What are the differences between freeze-dried and dehydrated camping foods?</h3><p>Dehydrating is a simple and ancient method of heating and drying food over some time to evaporate moisture, typically 80 percent or so. It's a cost-effective method that most folks can try through various methods. Freeze-drying is more complex, as food is flash-frozen at low pressure before gradually raising temperatures. This evaporates up to 95 percent of moisture without harsh heat, which may degrade nutritional content.</p><h3>Are backpacking meals healthy?</h3><p>In the sense that they provide hikers with sustenance, fats, and protein to fuel their expeditions, yes, they are quite nutritious and effective and deliver needed energy. But given many products' high-calorie counts and fat content, they can be over-consumed, especially when taken frequently with minimal physical activity. Save your freeze-dried gratin potatoes for when it's time not to be a couch potato.</p>"
snow boots for women,"<h2>FAQs on snow boots for women</h2><h3>Why do you need snow boots?</h3><p>Unless you are looking to be one of the 1,000,000 people who are injured each year due to falls on snow and ice, yes, you need snow boots if it regularly gets below freezing in your neck of the woods. Even if your area doesn't receive a lot of annual snowfall, It's definitely comforting to know that you can simply pull your trusty snow boots out of the closet to dig out your driveway in comfort after Snowmageddon hits.</p><h3>Can I use my hiking boots as snow boots?</h3><p>Because of their sticky treads and ankle support, hiking boots can be a great alternative to a full snow boot as long as they are insulated and waterproof. Since hiking boots generally only extend over the ankle and tend to have a wider opening at the top, I'd recommend buying leg gaiters to attach to your hiking boots to help keep the snow out. Leg gaiters can add up to 10 inches of waterproof material to your shins and calves and can cost as little as $15.</p><h3>Are snow boots good for hiking?</h3><p>Generally speaking, snow boots are not great for hiking long distances, although you can probably get away with wearing them to comfortably walk your dog around the block. But be aware that waterproofing and insulation can cause the feet to sweat, which means wearing them for extended periods without good socks can actually make your feet feel colder, regardless of the boot's temperature rating.</p><h3>How should snow boots fit?</h3><p>Snow boots are designed to fit snugly around the calf and shin to keep moisture out. While having a zipper for easy on/off access may appeal to you, note that a zipper makes it harder to keep moisture out. Choose a boot with an easy-to-use lacing system to ensure your boots are comfortable and also secure. Finally, ensure you choose snow boots that have enough room in the toe box (generally a thumb's length to the end of the boot) to allow your toes to wiggle and expand. This will promote heat circulation inside of your boots to keep your toes warm. Most experts recommend going a size up from your regular shoe size to ensure you have room to wear a good pair of wool socks.</p>"
hiking boots,"<h2>FAQs on hiking boots</h2><h3> Should hiking boots be a size bigger than your usual shoe?</h3><p>Sizing is personal. Generally speaking, order hiking boots the same way you order running shoes or work boots, keeping an eye out for brands that run large, small, narrow, or wide. The only caveat I'd offer is that people who hike in thick wool socks might need to account for the extra material by going one half-size up. There are plenty of modern hiking socks that can keep you warm and dry without being bulky, so this is a matter of personal taste.</p><h3> Do hiking boots stretch?</h3><p>Leather boots will break in to become more supple and adjust to the shape of your foot. I wouldn't go so far as to say they stretch, though. Most hiking boots use a combination of synthetic materials, though, so you can expect your hiking boots to fit basically the same throughout their service life.</p><h3> Can I wear hiking boots for regular walking?</h3><p>Absolutely. Being over-geared is a lot less problematic than being under-geared. Because of their price, I wouldn't recommend buying hiking boots specifically for walking, but there's no reason you couldn't lace up your hiking boots for a walk every now and then between camping trips. In fact, that's a great way to break them in.</p><h3> Do I need to spend a lot of money on hiking boots?</h3><p>Not necessarily. Most of us can have a blast with an entry-level or midrange pair of hiking boots. Plenty of up-and-coming manufacturers and established brands offer affordable hiking boots that pack a ton of value. That being said, if you're planning on climbing a 14er or hiking one of the National Scenic Trails you need to invest in something that's up to the challenge.</p><h3> How long should hiking boots last?</h3><p>Hiking boot life is probably best measured in miles, not years. Even then, there can be a huge amount of variation depending on the type of terrain you cover, the amount of weight you carry, and the amount of moisture your boots are exposed to. If you start with a quality item and take care of your boots, you can expect to get several hiking seasons out of them. At that point, rotate them into duty for yard work to stretch your dollar even further.</p>"
recumbent exercise bikes,"<h2>FAQs on recumbent exercise bikes</h2><h3>Who should use a recumbent bike?</h3><p>In fairness, anyone can use a recumbent exercise bike, from rookies to professionals. If you had to boil it down to a specific group, however, they're especially favored by the physically impaired in need of a machine that minimizes fatigue and risk of injury. Elderly, physical therapy patients and overweight individuals are prime examples of those who would benefit due to the design's inherent lack of stress on joints and bones.</p><h3>How long should you work out on a recumbent bike?</h3><p>Depending on your style of routine, the recommended duration may vary. Typically, high-intensity workouts favoring rapid calorie burning can be accomplished within 15 to 30 minutes. Those attempting to maintain a steady pace at a steady heart rate can press on for an hour or more depending on your own limits.</p><h3>Can you lose weight using a recumbent bike?</h3><p>Like any form of cardio, you can very much lose weight on a recumbent. It's all a matter of diet and workout intensity. Typically, higher intensity bursts of cardio may result in greater weight loss in a shorter time than longer, less strenuous routines.</p><h3>Should you stretch before riding a recumbent bike?</h3><p>As with any workout, you should always stretch no matter what. Even with the lessened strain of a recumbent, you're still engaging in some form of resistance training and could risk pulling something, especially if you decide to ramp up resistance levels. Do yourself a favor and stretch before and after your workout.</p><h3>Is a recumbent bike good cardio exercise?</h3><p>Yes, it can be effective just like any other form of cardio. It just depends on your exact use case and what your routine is. As professionals will preach, the same methodology applies: Higher intensity, short bursts will result in more calories burned quicker. Steady, continuous pedaling at a reasonable resistance may promote lower body muscle development and cardiovascular endurance.</p><h3>What is the difference between upright and recumbent exercise bikes?</h3><p>A recumbent exercise bike sports a laid-back, relaxed seating position that eases the spine and tailbone as you're not on a saddle hunching over handlebars. You're sitting in a more conventional chair-like position with legs outstretched, reducing strain on your joints, making recumbents ideal for physically-impaired athletes or those simply wanting to reduce the chance of injury.</p>"
shooting mats,"<h2>FAQs about shooting mats</h2><h3>What are shooting mats used for?</h3><p>Shooting mats allow hunters, recreational shooters, and military personnel to set up a shooting position in austere conditions where the ground may be wet, muddy, sandy, or covered in other undesirable material (e.g., coyote dung in the high deserts of Arizona).</p><h3>Why do you need to preload your bipod?</h3><p>Preloading a bipod is when the shooter ""leans in"" to the rifle, pressing forward with their entire body against the bipod to minimize the effect of the recoil impulse and the tendency for the rifle to jump off target after a shot. Done correctly, this allows the shooter to retain the sight picture during and after the shot, and substantially reduces the time required for a follow-up shot if necessary. Some shooting mats include ridges or straps to secure the feet of the bipod so that they don't slip when the bipod is preloaded. This feature is a ""nice-to-have"" rather than a ""must-have"" as the bipod can be preloaded effectively by using rubberized or spiked bipod feet or placing a small weight (e.g., sandbag) in front of the bipod.</p><h3>In what environment will you mainly be using the shooting mat?</h3><p>Generally speaking, shooting mats are used either on hard surfaces at established shooting facilities (concrete pads, gravel, etc) or in the backcountry on bare ground, which may also be wet, muddy, or sandy. The shooting mat keeps the shooter and their gear dry, clean, and reasonably comfortable.</p><h3>Can I stake down the shooting mat?</h3><p>Yes, many shooting mats have either grommets or stake loops in the corners to secure the mat during windy conditions.</p><h3>Can I use a shooting mat in wet environments?</h3><p>Absolutely! In wet environments, a quality mat makes the shooting experience more comfortable and improves the ability of the shooter to focus on the fundamentals: sight picture, breathing control, and the surprise trigger break.</p><h3>What else can I use a shooting mat for?</h3><p>Shooting mats are handy for a multitude of uses. I keep one in my truck for when I have to repair or maintain my truck. A shooting mat can also double as a ground cloth for camping or even as a small picnic blanket for lunch by the stream. Padded shooting mats can even replace closed-cell foam or inflatable sleeping mattresses when camping.</p>"
hiking pants for women,"<h2>FAQs on hiking pants for women</h2><h3>What's the best fabric for hiking pants for women?</h3><p>Freedom of movement is essential, which means you should look for hiking pants with a high nylon and elastic content. The beauty is that these materials are not only stretchy, but they are also breathable, moisture-wicking, and can also help you regulate your body temperature.</p><h3>What extra features of hiking pants for women do you need?</h3><p>Pockets, pockets, and more pockets. Seriously, hiking pants need to be functional, but to maximize your comfort, look for pants with zippers for venting, a built-in belt or loops, a gusseted crotch, and articulated knees.</p><h3>Do I need hiking pants, outdoor pants, functional pants, or trekking pants?</h3><p>Good question with a simple answer: A good pair of hiking pants can serve many purposes, including hiking, climbing, and mountaineering.</p><h3>What insulation should my hiking pants have?</h3><p>It depends on what activities you have planned. If you are doing things in the winter, softshell pants often come with a fleece lining to help insulate you. The beauty of hiking pants is that base layers can be worn underneath for added protection from the cold.</p><h3>How do waterproof finishes differ for hiking pants?</h3><p>There is no such thing as waterproof clothing. Exposure to the elements and washing will diminish the amount of water resistance your outdoor clothing provides. The good news is that you can restore their water resistance between washes by applying beeswax or water resistance sprays.</p><h3>What practical details should hiking pants have?</h3><p>If you want pants that will offer maximum mobility without dragging you down, look for hiking trousers made from stretchy nylon fabric with leg zippers for venting, crotch gusseting, articulated knee darts. Nylon fabric will help move moisture away from your skin to keep you warm and dry while gussets and knee darts will ensure you can move through the most challenging terrain with ease.</p><h3>What hiking pants should I wear in the summer?</h3><p>Unless I plan to go bushwacking, I tend to wear running shorts but always carry my Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Pants for rain and wind protection and an extra layer of warmth in a pinch. However, quick-drying, lightweight Outdoor Research Ferrosi Pants are an excellent option for summer hikes, and have an elastic cinch cord at the cuff for additional venting and breathability.</p>"
backpacking sleeping bags,"<h2>FAQs on backpacking sleeping bags</h2><h3>How do you pack a sleeping bag in a backpack?</h3><p>The best way to pack a sleeping bag is to invert it and stuff it into a compression stuff sack to smash it to the smallest possible mass. Place lighter items like sleeping bags at the bottom of your pack and heavier items higher up between your shoulders. Make sure you put down insulated bags in a waterproof stuff sack or waterproof the main compartment of your backpack with a large leaf bag.</p><h3>What's the best size sleeping bag for backpacking?</h3><p>Get the one that matches your height most closely. Most mid- and high-end bag manufacturers offer their bags in regular (up to 72 inches) or long (up to 78 inches). Some offer small or short variants (around 66 inches), and some premium manufacturers even offer small, regular, and large girth size options. Other high-end manufacturers offer made-to-order custom bags.</p><h3>How heavy should a backpacking sleeping bag be?</h3><p>Look for the lightest bag that meets your desired temperature range. Most good three-season bags weigh less than two pounds, and good four-season bags weigh less than three pounds.</p><h3>What's the difference between a backpacking and camping sleeping bag?</h3><p>Backpacking bags are much lighter, more compressible, and more efficient in terms of warmth-to-weight ratios due to high power (800+) down fill, thin high-tensile shell material, and mummy-shaped form-fitting design.</p><h3>How is down fill power measured?</h3><p>Down is measured by fill power - how much loft and volume it provides per ounce. It's a relative measure of down quality in terms of fluffiness. Fill power is a measure of how many cubic inches of loft that one ounce of down produces. For instance, 650 fill power down means one ounce by weight will provide 650 cubic inches of loft and thus dead trapped air. Similarly, one ounce of 800 fill power down will provide an additional 150 cubic inches of loft - more insulation for the same weight. The higher the number, the higher the quality. Note that you need to combine fill power with fill weight to determine how warm a sleeping bag is because a bag with 10 ounces of 600 fill down won't be nearly as warm as a bag with 10 ounces of 800 fill down.</p>"
weighted vests,"<h2>FAQs on weighted vests</h2><p>A weighted vest will help your fitness by increasing the level of exertion required to complete a given task. If you'd like a working example, do a set of 10 bodyweight squats. Not too hard, right? Now grab a 25-pound weight (or something approximate) and do another 10 squats. Pretty big difference. The increased excretion helps to burn more calories and build more muscle, which are the two primary goals of working out in the first place.</p><p>This depends a lot on your current level of fitness and your overall fitness goals, but a good rule of thumb for the average person is about 10 percent of your current body weight as a maximum.</p><p>Yes. Should you? Well, that's a different story. Again, this is completely dependent on your goals and your current fitness, not to mention what you do all day. If you work at a desk all day or sit around watching bad daytime TV, it's probably not worth the effort. Also, if you're not used to a weighted vest, you shouldn't jump right into wearing it all day long. Work your way up to longer periods and, even then, allow yourself some time away from it, if for no other reason than to let your skin breathe. Many soldiers wear their vest for long periods of time, just in the normal course of work, but then again most of us end up with bad backs and knees.</p><p>Yes, but the vest is only part of the answer. A weighted vest will help you burn more calories in whatever activity you're doing, but keep in mind that weight loss is primarily diet-driven. If calories burnt is greater than calories consumed, you'll lose weight. Long story short, you can't up your food intake to match your exertion.</p><p>You can perform pretty much any type of exercise in a weighted vest, but you want to make sure you're smart about what you're doing. For example, running with large amounts of weight can be detrimental to your back and joints, especially if you don't build up appropriately. High impact, repetitious activities might be better served with lower weights and a good long build-up period.</p>"
camping stoves,"<h2>FAQs on camping stoves</h2><p>The stove that is best is one that you can get a proper pot or pan on top of, has sufficient BTU output, can simmer, and has enough of a flame distribution to avoid hot spots and scorching. Generally, these are car camping/basecamp stoves.</p><p>Most stoves I've inspected are pretty simple. For backpacking stoves, I prefer the integrated canister stoves like the JetBoil MiniMo and Zip. For car camping stoves, I prefer the two-burner three-sided windscreen models like the Camp Chef Everest 2X or Coleman Classic. In almost every case, someone has done a YouTube video on how to operate them.</p><p>It depends. If traveling by foot and backpack, get a backpacking stove. By car? Then get a car camping stove. If by air, check to see what the airline will allow aboard and what fuels are available at your destination. They typically don't let you fly with fuel.</p><p>Not typically. Some require you to change a small part of the burner depending on the fuel. If so, it's not hard.</p><p>Ok, I didn't want to, but I quickly researched this, and don't fully understand what this event is about. I saw kids with backpacks on the website, so keep it small and simple like the JetBoil Zip. That is if you like them. If not, get them the biggest, heaviest stove to carry around.</p><p>For backpacking, the JetBoil Zip is hard to beat. Also, check out the MSR PocketRocket Deluxe. For car camping stoves, check out the Camp Chef Everest 2X.</p><p>I don't advise it, especially not inside a tent. You could asphyxiate, which is bad. These stoves put out carbon monoxide which can kill you if you inhale too much of it.</p><p>Almost all just screw on.</p><p>It depends. The more BTUs it puts out, the more fuel it uses.</p><p>No. We do NOT recommend this as they put out carbon monoxide, which is colorless and odorless and can kill you or give you brain damage. Also, your tent could catch fire and you could burn to death - a horrible, melted nylon-coated, flaming death.</p>"
cabin tents,"<h2>FAQs on cabin tents</h2><h3>How do you set up a cabin tent?</h3><p>Most cabin tents are very similar in setup, and consist of poles and rods (often fiberglass) that create a frame to support the outer fabric. Stakes are used to secure the tent to the ground, and more stakes used with guylines to help spread out windows and the rainfly. Be sure to follow the directions provided by the tent makers. When you get a new tent (or are gifted a used one), always set it up completely at home before using it for camping. You don't want to find out that there's a huge gash in it, during a rainstorm while on vacation</p><h3>What is the purpose of a cabin tent?</h3><p>A cabin tent is a great way for a family or group of people to camp together at an established or easy to get to camp site. They're designed to be much larger and a little more sturdy than dome tents, which are smaller and designed to be carried into more remote locations.</p><h3>Are cabin tents waterproof?</h3><p>This varies from tent to tent, but many are not actually waterproof. Most are ""water resistant"", so they can hold up to a light rain for a while, but will eventually start to leak. Always check the tent's product page when you buy to understand what kind of waterproofing/resistance your tent has. A waterproof rainfly (which is often, but not always, included) is a great way to increase a tent's ability to keep out precipitation.</p><h3>Do cabin tents lose their waterproofing?</h3><p>Yes. The amount of use and type of weather you expose your tent to will have an impact on how often you should re-waterproof it. It might seem a little counter-intuitive, but if you find yourself often camping in areas that expose your tent to little rain but lots of direct sunlight, you'll need to re-waterproof it before too long. The sunlight can actually break down or dry out the tent's waterproofing. For regular use, think about applying a waterproofing agent every couple of years.</p>"
gun cleaning kits,"<h2>FAQs on gun cleaning kits</h2><h3>Do you have to clean a gun if you don't use it?</h3><p>It depends on your storage area. If you keep your guns in a cool and dry place, then probably not, but if your guns are stored in a wet or humid area, then you should occasionally check your guns for rust. If you see rust, you should lightly clean away the rust and apply a light coat of oil to protect your firearm.</p><h3>Are you supposed to clean a brand-new gun?</h3><p>A better way to ask this question is ""when should I clean a brand new gun?"" A ""new gun"" by definition has never been used (except for a single test fire at the factory), so it shouldn't be dirty. However, the best answer is to follow the guidelines in the instruction manual. Still, if it makes you more comfortable cleaning it before shooting it, by all means, clean it.</p><h3>What gun cleaning kit does the military use?</h3><p>The U.S. military issues multiple different gun cleaning kits. The Otis Technology IWCK and the Otis Technology Tactical Cleaning Kit are two such cleaning kits.</p><h3>How often should you clean your gun?</h3><p>Opinions on this vary widely, so a definitive answer can be hard to nail down. Generally speaking, we'd say a good routine is probably to conduct a dry (i.e., no liquids) cleaning every 250 rounds/monthly and a wet/deep cleaning annually/every 3,000 rounds. If your guns spend lots of time in the safe, then we'd recommend wet-cleaning them after every range trip.</p><h3>Can you clean a gun without a kit?</h3><p>Only if you plan to build your own kit. So, no.</p><h3>What happens if you don't clean your gun?</h3><p>With time, your firearm will deteriorate. Depending on the gun, it will rust or corrode and the barrel may start pitting, destroying its accuracy and degrading its structural integrity. In an absolute worst-case scenario, extreme corrosion could turn your barrel into a homemade hand grenade or a first-class rust bucket.</p>"
4 season tents,"<h2>FAQs about 4-season tents</h2><h3>What's the difference between a 3-season and 4-season tent?</h3><p>A 3-season tent refers to a tent that's suitable for camping in the spring, summer, and fall. A 4-season tent can be used during any of those seasons but also covers winter. All-season tents are designed to be versatile enough to use in the summer when camping involves optimal cooling ventilation, but sturdy and insulating enough to provide shelter during winter weather.</p><p>If you're exclusively looking for a backpacking tent for summer adventures, a 4-season tent could be overkill and leave you carrying more weight than necessary.</p><h3>Do I need a 4-season tent for winter?</h3><p>If you plan on overnighting in extreme weather in winter temps, you're probably best off with a 4-season tent for camping. While a 3-season tent could suffice for winter camping in some regions, a 4-season tent offers better protection and insulation in harsher conditions like snow or high winds. Good 4-season tents are also built to withstand the weight of snow accumulation which might not be true of a 3-season tent. Boiled down, if you plan on doing harsh winter-weather camping, a 4-season tent is a safer bet to keep you protected from the elements.</p><h3>How do you keep the bottom of a tent dry?</h3><p>No one likes to retire to a soggy tent after a day of adventure, so you'll want to keep the bottom of the tent dry, regardless of whether it's a 4-season or 3-season tent. To do this, you'll want to lay down a footprint under your tent that creates a barrier between the ground and the tent. Some tents are sold with a footprint, but you might need to purchase one separately. Almost every tent manufacturer sells footprints that fit the dimensions of the tents they make. You can also opt for a ground tarp, but you'll want to have a system to anchor it down well in case the wind starts howling.</p>"
hunting backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about hunting backpacks</h2><h3>Why do I need a hunting backpack?</h3><p>Try stuffing enough gear, food, ammo, shelter, and other equipment for a three-day elk hunt into your hunting pants pockets, and you'll get your answer. If things go your way, you'll quickly realize that elk quarters aren't exactly pocket-sized.</p><h3>What size hunting backpack should I get?</h3><p>For cargo capacity, the ""right size"" hunting backpack varies from hunter to hunter and from hunt to hunt. When in doubt, figure about 1,000 cubic inches per day.</p><p>The ""right size"" backpack frame depends on your torso size. To determine your torso size, check out this video. When in doubt about pack sizing, contact the manufacturer.</p><h3>Which frame should I choose?</h3><p>Hunting backpack frames are not interchangeable across brands. If you want an Eberlestock pack, then get the (correct) Eberlestock frame.</p><h3>Why do some backpacks have a hip belt?</h3><p>Hip belts, especially in conjunction with load lifters or other suspension systems, do an excellent job of redistributing weight away from the shoulder to one of the body's best load-bearing structures, closer to your center of gravity. This makes heavy loads more comfortable and improves stability while on the move.</p><h3>What should I pack in my hunting backpack?</h3><p>What kind of game are you hunting and how long do you plan to stay in the field? Besides a first aid kit, food, water, lighting, and emergency survival gear, your packing list will heavily depend on how you answer those two questions.</p><h3>How do I clean and wash my hunting backpack?</h3><p>Follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions printed on the tag. It may not feel manly, but it could save you hundreds.</p><h3>How do I adjust my hunting backpack?</h3><p>Start with all the pack's straps loosened. Center your hip belt on the top of your hip bone (iliac crest) and tighten the straps. Next, snug up (but don't overtighten) the shoulder straps, load lifters (on top of the shoulder straps), and sternum strap. Click here for a visual rundown.</p>"
north face backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about North Face backpacks</h2><h3>How good are North Face backpacks?</h3><p>The North Face has a reputation for producing quality products, and its backpacks are no different. Plenty of TNF packs have endured years of heavy use without breaking a sweat. Whenever you purchase a TNF pack, you will pay for the name, but the quality that goes with it usually will justify the price.</p><h3>How much protection do North Face backpacks offer your belongings?</h3><p>As backpacks go, The North Face's packs do a good job of providing protection for your gear. In addition to water-resistant finishes, TNF's bags usually include fleece-lined phone and tablet sleeves, as well as padded laptop sleeves. Some laptop sleeves are even suspended for extra protection, although don't bother trying to predict which packs will have it.</p><h3>Are North Face backpacks good for your back?</h3><p>That depends on what you mean. The North Face backpacks equipped with the FlexVent suspension system are certified by the American Chiropractic Association, which basically means the system is designed to anatomically match your back and shoulders. Of course, a heavily loaded pack won't do your body much good over long periods of time no matter how good the ergonomics.</p><h3>Do all North Face backpacks include a lifetime warranty?</h3><p>All North Face backpacks come with a limited lifetime guarantee. This means that if the bag fails due to a manufacturing defect, it's covered so long as it isn't a ""renewed"" pack. Unfortunately, packs are only warranted to the original owner. For more details, visit the company's warranty page.</p><h3>What North Face backpack has the most room?</h3><p>The L/XL version of the Griffin 75 offers a whopping 74 liters of cargo capacity, while the S/M ""only"" offers 69 liters. Of course, most city dwellers will need or use such a pack, so take a look at the Router which has 40 liters of space inside. The women's Surge is the largest women's backpack, coming in at 31 liters.</p>"
backpacking sleeping pads,"<h2>FAQs on backpacking sleeping pads</h2><h3>What is R-value?</h3><p>The R-value is short for ""resistance value"" and refers to the pad's ability to resist heat transference. High R-value sleeping pads are better for cold weather while lower R-value pads are better for warmer temperatures.</p><h3>What is a good weight for a backpacking sleeping pad?</h3><p>The answer to this question truly depends on what you intend to do. For those looking to through-hike or do multi-day backpacking excursions, you'll want an ultralight pad weighing one pound or less. If you're only going on a one or two-day trip then you would probably be fine with something under five pounds. Anything over five pounds would be best for car camping or other uses that don't require you to carry the pad.</p><h3>Can I use more than one sleeping pad?</h3><p>Yes, but I don't encourage more than two. The best way to do this would be to use a closed-cell foam pad as the base and place an open-cell foam or air core pad on top. This is a great way to amplify the R-values, especially on frozen terrain.</p><h3>How to store a sleeping pad?</h3><p>For closed-cell foam pads, they are easily rolled or folded up and can be stored naked or in a case. Open-cell foam pads can be rolled up as well but for long-term storage, it is a good idea to keep it semi-inflated so the foam doesn't stay compressed. Air core pads can be simply stored in their carrying case after deflating and rolling them up.</p><h3>How do I choose the right size and shape sleeping pad?</h3><p>Ultimately the size of the pad will be determined by your height as you should be able to lay on the pad without your feet or head touching the ground. The shape is trickier only in the sense that it is a personal preference. The shape doesn't matter unless you plan to put your pad inside of your sleeping bag.</p>"
binoculars for hunting,"<h2>FAQs on hunting binoculars</h2><h3>What do the numbers mean when buying binoculars?</h3><p>The first number in the model designation indicates the magnification power of the binoculars, which tells you by how many times the image you're seeing is enlarged. The most common magnification powers on the market are 8x, 10x, and 12x. The second number in the model designation is the objective lens diameter, which is measured in millimeters. The larger the objective lens, the more light will be captured by the binoculars, creating a brighter, clearer image. Unfortunately, the larger lenses also add extra weight.</p><h3>What should I look for when buying binoculars?</h3><p>The best bet is to look for binoculars that have fully multi-coated lenses. This means that all lens surfaces have been treated with multiple layers of coating to increase light transmission, reduce glare, and protect the lens from scratching or chipping. You should also ensure the binoculars are waterproofed and either Argon or Nitrogen purged to prevent internal fogging.</p><h3>What size binocular lenses are best for hunting?</h3><p>This is dependent on your style of hunting. If you are on the move constantly, you may not want heavy or bulky binoculars, so a pair with a lower objective lens size might be more beneficial. If you are a stationary hunter, having something with a greater objective lens will help brighten the images you glass.</p><h3>What is the best binocular magnification for hunting?</h3><p>For hunting in wooded areas where there are not long lines of sight, it is best to go with a magnification level of 8x or 10x. These levels will be more than adequate and will make it easier to find your intended target. When hunting large expanses, it may be more beneficial to go with a 12x or 15x magnification, depending on how far you're looking. Keep in mind that the greater magnification will also enhance the shake in your hands, so a trusty tripod might be beneficial.</p>"
ar 15 scopes,"<h2>FAQs on AR-15 scopes</h2><h3>What optics do the Navy SEALs use?</h3><p>Navy SEALs use many different types of optics, including the optics that were listed here. The EoTech EXPS in particular has been spotted in heavy rotation since its inception. However, no list is ever going to be truly comprehensive, given the dizzying speed at which new optics are developed and adopted among special operations forces.</p><h3>What is the clearest rifle scope?</h3><p>In my personal experience, Trijicon has produced some of the clearest magnified optics out there, with both the ACOG and VCOG providing gloriously sharp images and great light transmission that's comparable with the naked eye. This should be taken with a grain of salt because I've never had the chance to look through something from Schmidt & Bender or anything of that caliber.</p><h3>What is an LPVO scope?</h3><p>Low power variable optics (LPVO) are optics that feature a relatively low maximum magnification, but allow you to cycle through magnifications to get a sight picture that fits the task and hand. Whether they're older types like the Elcan Specter, or the latest 2.5-8x optic being fielded by the Marine Corps on the M38 Squad Designated Marksman Rifle system, LPVOs are excellent when you expect to engage targets at a variety of unpredictable distances.</p><h3>What magnification is needed for AR-15 scopes?</h3><p>The magnification needed will change based on the task at hand. In general, I've found that unmagnified optics are capable for addressing targets less than 100 yards away; 4x magnification for 300 yards; and 8x or higher for 500 yards or more. If you anticipate engaging targets at a wide variety of distances, it might be worth it to shell out for a quality LPVO, which gives you the flexibility to adjust the magnification on the fly.</p><h3>Why do you need fancy optics? Back in my day we shot iron sights on the M16A1 and we liked it! This new Corpsâ€¦</h3><p>OK, Boomer.</p>"
spotting scopes,"<h2>FAQs on spotting scopes</h2><h3>What is a spotting scope used for?</h3><p>Spotting scopes are used to see accurately at great distances. Hunters and wildlife tour guides use them to observe and identify animals without disturbing them. At the range, spotting scopes allow shooters to evaluate their shot placement without leaving the bench.</p><h3>Can you use a telescope as a spotting scope?</h3><p>It's possible, but we wouldn't recommend it. Telescopes tend to be much larger and more fragile than a spotting scope.</p><h3>Can I attach a camera to my spotting scope?</h3><p>Yes, and that's a great way to get the most out of it. Wildlife guides and hunters both use this technique to take pictures of the animals they see. You might be surprised by how well the pictures turn out.</p><h3>What makes a spotting scope good for hunting?</h3><p>Spotting scopes allow hunters to see far beyond what's possible with the naked eye, binoculars, or a rifle scope. They allow much better target identification and can scan distant terrain much more effectively than less-powerful optics.</p><h3>How should I carry my spotting scope?</h3><p>Spotting scopes are built for hunters who will be carrying them across rugged terrain in all kinds of weather. That being said, they're still precision optics and it's a good idea to take care of them with a padded case when possible.</p><h3>What do the numbers on a spotting scope mean?</h3><p>Numbers before the X indicate the fixed or telescopic range of magnification. The number after the X indicates the objective lens size in millimeters. A scope labeled 10-20Ã—40 can zoom between 10- and 20-power magnification and has an objective lens that's 40 millimeters in diameter.</p><h3>What magnifications are typical for spotting scopes?</h3><p>Most spotting is probably done between 30- and 40-power magnification. Plenty of spotting scopes reach far beyond that, and there are times when that's useful. People in wide-open landscapes with clear, calm air can certainly take advantage of more powerful optics.<br/>"
climbing packs,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>All the climbing packs in this review were selected based on performance reputation, hands-on inspection, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. We take our time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.</p><h3>FAQs on climbing backpacks</h3><h3>How do I know what size pack to get?</h3><p>There are two essential considerations on pack sizes. First, get a pack that fits your body (torso and waist measurements), and second, get a pack that's big enough to support the climbing you are going to do. It's useful to think of this in terms of days.</p><h3>Do I need ice axe and crampon retention systems?</h3><p>Yes, if you care about living and are going to move over snow and ice. If you're not moving over snow and ice (check the weather forecast), then you might consider a pack without them to save weight.</p><h3>Can I get away with just one pack?</h3><p>It depends. There's a lot of versatility in the 35- to 50-liter range of packs. If in doubt, go with the larger pack that has compression straps and a longer snow skirt that enables overstuffing. I've used one trusty 40-liter pack for years and it met most of my needs reliably.</p><h3>What's the best way to determine what size I need to fit my body?</h3><p>Check each manufacturer's specs for the torso length and hip belt dimensions. Most manufacturers make climbing packs in small/medium and medium/large sizes. The best thing is to try them on in the store with a load in the main storage chamber. Even better is to buy them online from a reputable retailer with a solid return policy, take them to a climbing gym, treat them carefully, and see how they perform on a wall.</p>"
boot knives,"<h2>FAQs on boot knives</h2><h3>Are boot knives illegal?</h3><p>It's not illegal to own a boot knife, but your state might regulate knives in other ways. For example, some states prohibit concealing a knife and/or carrying a knife with a blade longer than a specified length. Therefore, you should always review your state laws before strapping on a boot knife.</p><h3>How practical is a boot knife?</h3><p>At the risk of angering boot knife enthusiasts, I'd say not super practical for anyone who isn't trained in handling weapons in hand-to-hand combat. They are great if you want to have a knife available and don't want the clip showing for whatever reason. But if you want it for self-defense and aren't trained, the boot knife might not be reliable.</p><h3>How do you wear a boot knife?</h3><p>It varies by design, but generally you secure the sheath to your boot or around your ankle with a clip or strap. When you plan to carry it this way, you have to be careful that it doesn't rub against your skin and that the blade stays secure. If concealment isn't a concern, you could go full combat-style and tie it around your boot with your boot laces. Another good option is an ankle wrap like this one from Gerber. And of course, you can wear it on your belt.</p><h3>Should I buy a single- or double-edge boot knife?</h3><p>It depends on how you intend on using your boot knife. Either edge works for EDC, but a double-edge works better for self-defense because you won't have to keep track of the business end. Still, like you can see with the Kershaw Secret Agent, even with a single-edge, you can stab and slash effectively.</p><h3>How much does a boot knife weigh?</h3><p>They tend to be light and narrow, which is better for concealment. Most knives weigh anywhere from two to nine ounces.</p>"
running shorts for women,"<h2>FAQs on women's running shorts</h2><h3>Why do women's running shorts have liners?</h3><p>It isn't just women's running shorts that come with liners. Many men's running shorts have them, too. In addition to providing support for your nether regions, a running short liner helps wick moisture away from your crotch, which, let's be honest, doesn't come equipped with a fan and can get pretty sticky during physically demanding activity. A good liner can also help maintain your body temperature.</p><h3>Why is there netting in women's running shorts?</h3><p>Netting or mesh inserts commonly found in the legs of women's running shorts serve as vents to allow heat and moisture to escape. They also promote circulation and airflow, keeping you cool and dry on your runs.</p><h3>What do female athletes wear under their running shorts?</h3><p>There is no one right answer to this question (and shame on you for asking!), but most female athletes don't wear anything under their shorts, particularly if their running shorts come with a breathable liner that wicks moisture away from the skin. If they wear shorts without a brief-style liner, they might wear spandex or compression-style underwear. The crazy thing is that when I asked Google this question, 37,000,000 results showed up, indicating that the world is a very, very sick place.</p><h3>Will the proprietary fabric in my women's running shorts help me run faster?</h3><p>Unless you are the beautiful and accomplished Elaine Thompson-Herah, sadly, chances are, no. While proprietary fabrics may help you stay cooler and drier for longer, you won't likely run much faster as a result of wearing them. The costs passed down to the consumer for brand name logo notoriety, proprietary fabrics, or manufacturing processes all add up, making it worth investing in some running shorts that perhaps lack proprietary technology or materials but are able to wick sweat away from your skin.</p>"
backpacking backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about backpacking backpacks</h2><h3>What is the best backpack brand for backpacking?</h3><p>It's the one that fits you. I'm not being coy here. Folks tend to think if they spend enough money, they can get the ""best"" backpack. It's true that there are quality brands (like all the brands listed above), but take a moment to skim through product reviews of even the best backpacking packs, and you'll see complaints of all sorts related to fit. Like running shoes, you want a pack that best fits your body type, and the way you find that is either by trial and error or by a professional fitting.</p><h3>How big of a backpack do you need for a three- to five-day backpacking trip?</h3><p>Generally speaking, you'll want to have a 50L backpacking pack for up to three days in the backcountry, and 50L to 70L for longer trips. As you get more experienced and learn to plan and slim down your load, you can find that 50L bags can carry you a long way.</p><h3>Which is better for backpacking backpacks, Deuter or Osprey?</h3><p>Obviously, it's a personal choice because both are high-quality brands. The Germany-based Deuter is very popular in Europe, while Osprey rules in the United States. Personally, I prefer Osprey backpacks because they're a little lighter and packed with features. But I was impressed with the Aircontact Core. Both deserve to be ranked among the best backpacking brands.</p><h3>Are hiking backpacks worth it?</h3><p>Yes. The best hiking backpacks and the best backpacking packs are designed to distribute the weight of your gear so that you can actually enjoy your time in the backcountry and experience the adventure you're seeking. You can find some good bargains (like the REI Co-op Trailbreak 60 listed above), but skimp too much and you risk gear failure when it's least convenient.</p>"
running watches,"<h2>FAQs on running watches</h2><h3>What should I look for in a running watch?</h3><p>At a minimum, you're going to want a watch that accurately tracks your heart rate and GPS position, and provides you feedback on your workouts so you can target performance improvement.</p><h3>What is a good running watch for beginners?</h3><p>If you are looking to try a running watch but aren't fully committed to paying hundreds of dollars for capabilities you might not need, check out the Garmin Forerunner 45. It's basic, but will give you the basics: heart rate, GPS tracks, access to Garmin Coach, smart notifications, incident detection and assistance, and up to seven days of battery life all for just over $100.</p><h3>How useful is a running watch?</h3><p>Not to be cute, but it's as useful as you make it. I've found that tracking workout data motivates me to exercise more frequently and longer. It also helps track your weekly workouts to keep you honest. You'll train better with better data, and that's the whole point.</p><h3>Running watch vs. fitness tracker?</h3><p>If you want to accurately track your workout distance and pace and want to leave your phone at home, get a GPS running watch. If you want to track your walking or stair climbing, but accuracy isn't a priority, get a fitness tracker.</p><h3>How much should I spend on a fitness watch?</h3><p>It depends. If you want a basic watch, about $120. If you want some premium functions but not a premium price, about $250. If you want the very best, you're looking at $550 and up.</p><h3>Do I need a running watch?</h3><p>No. You can get off your ass, lace up your running shoes, and run - but you won't get any workout data that way and might get lost because you don't have GPS and you failed land nav class.</p>"
climbing harnesses,"<h2>FAQs about climbing harnesses</h2><h3>Can you rock climb without a harness?</h3><p>Yes, you can climb without a harness. If you've seen the award-winning documentary Free Solo with legendary climber Alex Honnold, your palms dripped with sweat as he climbed a massive wall without a harness or rope. But most of us feel a heck of a lot more comfortable climbing with a harness. Should you lose grip of a hold or experience a foot slip, a rock climbing harness is there to catch your fall. It's also possible to rock climb without a harness if you're bouldering. Rather than scaling big walls, bouldering is climbing on shorter routes that usually don't go higher than 15 feet.</p><h3>Is there a difference between men's and women's climbing harnesses?</h3><p>Yep, men's and women's climbing harnesses are different. The primary difference is in the rise of the harness, and the distance between the leg loops and the waist belt. Rock climbing harnesses designed for feminine figures have a longer rise when compared to men's. It's also common for women's harnesses to have smaller leg loops, but that's not always the case, especially if they're adjustable.</p><h3>How should a climbing harness fit?</h3><p>The fit of your rock climbing harness is incredibly important to how comfortable you'll feel while wearing it and also plays into its functionality. An ill-fitting harness could be dangerous and lead to injury if you were to fall. Experts say a rock climbing harness should feel snug but not pinch anywhere. The typical rule of thumb is that you should be able to fit two fingers or less between the harness and your body in both the waistband area and the leg loops. The exception to this rule is if the leg loops have elastic material so the stretch might allow for more room.</p>"
treadmills under 500,"<h2>FAQs on treadmills under $500</h2><h3>Which treadmill is the most reliable?</h3><p>In this budget-friendly price range, one of the most reliable brands of treadmills is Sunny Health & Fitness. This company offers a sizable range of treadmills that cost under $500. It gets a lot of positive feedback and offers one of the best warranties in the industry.</p><h3>What is the best time of year to buy a treadmill?</h3><p>There are several times each year when treadmills tend to go on sale: Black Friday and Cyber Monday often have excellent deals on athletic equipment. Also, January will often be a good month to purchase a treadmill, as they usually go on sale after Christmas. As the weather turns nicer, the springtime can also be a good time to find treadmills on sale, since so many people are coming out of hibernation and beginning to get back outside, versus working out in their homes like they do in the winter months.</p><h3>Is a cheap treadmill worth it?</h3><p>If you're a die-hard indoor walker or runner, a cheaper treadmill may not meet your needs. However, there are many durable and reliable treadmills to be found for under $500 that are ideal for light to moderate use or as a way to keep moving while working from home. Just be sure to get one that comes backed by a decent warranty to protect your investment in the event of any unforeseen manufacturer's defects or malfunctions.</p><h3>Does a treadmill reduce belly fat?</h3><p>There are several studies that show that regular exercise on a treadmill can reduce belly fat. Depending on how long and often you use the treadmill, your results will vary. Reduction in belly fat can also be enhanced by watching what you eat and reducing your fat and sugar intake.</p>"
camping blankets,"<h2>FAQs about camping blankets</h2><h3>Which is better for camping, a sleeping bag or blanket?</h3><p>This depends on your camping situation and preferences. A sleeping bag is generally larger, heavier, and bulkier/less packable than a blanket, but is typically warmer than a blanket. Also, there are many more sleeping bag options on the market than camping blankets at this time, so finding a sleeping bag for a particular situation may be easier than finding a camping blanket. However, a camping blanket is typically more versatile than a sleeping bag and, along with reduced weight and increased packability, it might be the right choice for your camping situation.</p><h3>How do I choose a camping blanket?</h3><p>There are several major considerations when choosing a camping blanket. Most importantly is comfort. How cold is it going to be where you're going? Is there a ""comfort side"" to the blanket? Next is weight and packability. Are you going on a several-day hiking or camping trip? If so, you'll want a light, compact blanket. Durability and water resistance are important considerations as well. For car-based camping without pets, a lighter-duty blanket may work. For backpacking or camping with dogs, you'll want a tougher blanket.</p><h3>Do Mylar camping blankets really work?</h3><p>Mylar blankets have several legitimate uses. If you're counting on mylar to be your sole warmth-retaining layer, you'll be disappointed. However, when combined with a more traditional sleeping bag, blanket, or clothing layers, mylar does help to keep wind and rain at bay and to retain heat. Mylar blankets can also be used as a ground sheet, to reflect campfire heat back to you, or for signaling. Given their extremely compact size when folded and their light weight, adding a Mylar blanket to your camping kit is not a bad idea.</p>"
medicine balls,"<h2>FAQs about medicine balls</h2><h3>What is the best weight and size for a medicine ball?</h3><p>It depends on your use. For basic workouts such as lunges, twists, and squats, a medium to small ball - 12 inches and below - would be easier to grip and available in lower weights. Wall balls and slam balls will be heavier for bodybuilding types and are larger for easier catching and better impact distribution.</p><h3>What are the best medicine ball workouts for abs?</h3><p>From personal experience, choose something where you can get a solid, sturdy grip. Skip slippery surfaces such as leather or non-textured rubber. Use something with handles or at least textured rubber, and preferably a smaller diameter that's easy to hold closely without your arms positioned awkwardly.</p><h3>Are medicine balls with handles better?</h3><p>It depends on what you're trying to achieve. Slamming and throwing? Most definitely not. But for gripping during ab workouts or even using for curls and tricep extensions in lieu of kettlebells? Medicine balls with handles may be the perfect, do-it-all purchase.</p><h3>What is the difference between a medicine ball and a wall ball?</h3><p>Wall balls are essentially medicine balls bulked up and reinforced to handle more strenuous workouts. They will be available in heavier weights and larger sizes, and sport leather or vinyl exteriors to withstand the impacts of being thrown about. Of course, you can still use them as regular medicine balls.</p><h3>Can you build muscle with a medicine ball?</h3><p>You absolutely can, just as you could with nearly any other piece of equipment. You're adding resistance and training your body to overcome it, especially as you increase the weight. Most medicine balls can be used in place of dumbbells or kettlebells for things like ab twists, curls, squats, and more.</p>"
kydex holsters,"<h2>FAQs about Kydex holsters</h2><h3>Do Kydex holsters scratch guns?</h3><p>Most modern firearms finishes aren't ""scratched"" by Kydex, but the plastic may leave a black residue on the finish that looks unsightly. The best solution to this is a little TLC and CLP. Pistols with mirror-polished finishes, gold plating, and so forth might possibly be marred by drawing and re-holstering in any material, due to things like dirt and other debris getting caught inside the holster. If you're worried about scratching the finish on your handgun, it's probably not a carry piece.</p><h3>Which is better, leather or Kydex?</h3><p>Kydex by far is the superior option, offering a degree of retention, full trigger protection, and a perfect fit every time. Leather holsters don't retain your firearm without things like thumb break straps, and they don't protect the trigger from outside manipulation or from catching on the edge of the holster, especially as the leather softens. This can cause a negligent discharge, and injure or kill the carrier.</p><h3>How long does a Kydex holster last?</h3><p>Kydex holsters last for a while, due to the fact that the material doesn't soften or degrade like leather. However, parts of the holster like the screws can loosen, and some cheaper holsters can break or crack due to the hard plastic becoming brittle. Periodically inspect your holster for cracks, and if you see them, replace it.</p><h3>Is Kydex IWB comfortable?</h3><p>No less comfortable than other options. Carrying a pistol comfortably is more dependent on the type of pistol being carried, the carrier's body type, and whether or not they use things like a proper pistol belt. Things like wedges, claws, and sweat guards further enhance comfort and make your pistol something you can carry on a daily basis.</p>"
running shorts for men,"<h2>FAQs on running shorts for men</h2><h3>Should running shorts be tight or loose?</h3><p>This is largely a personal choice. Unless you're Pietro Maximoff, you aren't going to run fast enough for your shorts to affect your aerodynamics and speed, so go with what works best for you.</p><h3>How does the length of men's running shorts affect performance?</h3><p>This depends on the type of running you are doing and the level of performance you can bring to the table. For sprinting, for example, you may want to avoid the longer shorts with five- to seven-inch inseams. The added material can bunch up and get in the way. On the other hand, you might want to avoid two-inch inseam split shorts for a long trail run.</p><h3>What's the best material for a pair of men's running shorts?</h3><p>The best material for men's running shorts is a synthetic fabric like polyester. Cotton is the enemy. Cotton is great for a cool shirt with your favorite band or sports team, but for running shorts, you would just be inviting sweat, humidity, and moisture to join you and ruin your day. Stick with something that wicks the moisture away from your body and has enough breathability to allow air to flow.</p><h3>Should I look for a pair of men's running shorts with a liner?</h3><p>Running shorts with a quality liner are great because they limit the layers of clothing you need when running, but not all liners are created equal. A good liner provides comfortable support and can help mitigate chafing. Liners do, however, have a tendency to stretch and wear out over time. If this happens, you can simply cut the offending liner out and replace it with a pair of quality underwear.</p>"
hardshell jackets,"<h2>FAQs about hardshell jackets</h2><h3>Do hardshell jackets keep you warm?</h3><p>Hardshell jackets protect against wind and rain, which will help you stay warm, but they don't have insulation. Your hardshell jacket should be large enough to fit over an appropriately insulated mid layer so you can add and remove layers throughout the day as necessary.</p><h3>What's the difference between hardshell and softshell jackets?</h3><p>Think of hardshell jackets as an evolution of the rain jacket. Softshell rain jackets might use two layers of material to create a waterproof barrier, but they aren't very durable. Hardshell jackets usually use three layers of material and are built to take more physical abuse. If you're just going to be running from the car to work in the rain, save some money and get a lightweight softshell jacket. If you're going to be breaking trail in the mountains, you need a hardshell jacket.</p><h3>Are hardshell jackets windproof?</h3><p>Yes, hardshell jackets are windproof and waterproof. They also hold up well against pokes and scrapes.</p><h3>What is the most eco-friendly hardshell jacket?</h3><p>Making the best products for the environment isn't always about sustainable materials and efficient manufacturing processes. One of the best things you can do is keep products out of the landfill. Patagonia is making that easier than ever by offering its already environmentally-friendly products available as used items that deserve a second lease on life. Check them out and save some money with the Worn Wear program.</p><h3>Is a hardshell jacket worth it?</h3><p>Hardshell jackets are an investment. If you plan on hiking, camping, skiing, or otherwise spending time in unforgiving environments, a hardshell jacket will earn its keep in no time. If you spend your free time in town, it's probably not necessary.</p>"
molle pouches,"<h2>FAQs about magazine pouches</h2><h3>What is a MOLLE pouch?</h3><p>A MOLLE pouch is any pouch that can attach to MOLLE or PALS webbing by means of straps, clips, or hooks. Newer types of webbing use laser cut material where the fabric of the carrier has slots cut directly into it for mounting, which saves on weight and bulk.</p><h3>What MOLLE pouch does the military use?</h3><p>Short answer is ""many different types,"" but in general, the MOLLE pouches that are officially sanctioned and purchased by the military must be Berry Amendment-compliant, meaning they have to be made in the USA of materials either from the USA or select allied countries. A quick way to tell is to see if the pouch in question carries an NSN, or National Stock Number. That means that the item in question has been entered into the GSA catalog, and can be purchased through official government channels. Brands that are commonly used by the military are Eagle Industries, High Speed Gear, Inc, Blue Force Gear, First Spear, S&S Precision, London Bridge Trading, Crye Precision, Tyr Tactical, and Paraclete. Every pouch on this list is made in the USA, and most of them are Berry compliant and carry an NSN.</p><h3>What is the best AR-15 magazine pouch?</h3><p>Overall, the best that we tested is the HSGI Taco pouch. It balances retention with ease of use, and supports many types of magazines, while being cost effective and readily available.</p><h3>What is the best competition magazine pouch?</h3><p>The best competition magazine pouch that we tested is the Safariland 774. It's fast, lightweight, and easily mounted to regular competition belts.</p><h3>What's the difference between a magazine carrier, a magazine pouch, and a magazine holster?</h3><p>Semantics, mostly.</p>"
home gyms,"<h2>FAQs on home gyms</h2><h3>Are home gyms worth it for beginners?</h3><p>Home gyms are often a great way for beginners to ""get their feet wet"" when it comes to exercise and proper form. Many newbies find going to a public club daunting and intimidating. They don't want to look silly or do the exercises the wrong way. In that respect, a home gym can be a great way for a beginner to get comfortable when it comes to getting started on a physical fitness routine.</p><h3>How much space do you need for a home gym?</h3><p>Depending on the gym you choose, you can do a solid workout in the space between your bed and dresser. Our top portable pick or a suspension trainer lets you turn your living room, hallway, entryway, etc. into a temporary gym space that's easy to convert back to living space when you're done with your workout. Heck, you can even turn a doorway into a home gym by simply adding a pull-up bar. Most free-standing, stationary home gyms require a space of at least four feet x four feet in order to allow you enough room to safely perform most of the exercises.</p><h3>Are home gyms effective?</h3><p>Home gyms are a highly effective means of exercise. Most of them are modeled after commercial gym equipment and strive to offer the same or very similar exercise experiences as what you would get at a commercial gym. Most home gyms also come with tutorial charts, DVDs, or apps that teach you how to properly and safely do the recommended exercises. Some even come with proposed workout routines and meal plans to help you really maximize your home workout results.<br/>"
damascus knives,"<h2>FAQs on Damascus knives</h2><h3>How good is Damascus steel for knives?</h3><p>It varies greatly, but quality Damascus is perfectly fine, it's worth noting that nothing currently on the market outperforms mono-steels like CPM S35VN or other common premium steels. And unfortunately, the cheaper, low quality Damascus that is frequently peddled can have serious issues, including poor edge retention, delamination, and rust.</p><h3>Do Damascus Knives rust?</h3><p>Any steel will rust, given the right conditions and a high enough carbon content, but you'll mainly see corrosion on pattern-welded Damascus that uses high-carbon steels like 1095. It's imperative that you keep non-stainless Damascus properly maintained to prevent the slightest chance of rust.</p><h3>Do Damascus knives hold an edge better?</h3><p>It depends on what you're comparing them to, but in general, most premium blade steels like CPM S35VN will consistently hold a better edge for longer.</p><h3>How should I maintain my Damascus knife?</h3><p>If it is made using carbon or high carbon steels, you'll want to keep it clean, to prevent any dirt buildup from allowing moisture to collect and cause rust. By the same token, you'll also want to dry off the blade as soon as possible after being exposed to water, and wipe it down every other week or so with a thin layer of oilâ€“ more frequently, if you live in a humid environment. It's also best to not store it in its sheath, as moisture can collect in there, without much chance to evaporate. Stainless Damascus and Damasteel are vastly easier to maintainâ€“ just keep them clean and dry, and they'll be happy.</p><h3>Should I buy a cheap pattern-welded Damascus knife?</h3><p>Lol, no. I can't stress how much of a waste of money these are.</p>"
dive watches under 500,"<h2>FAQs on dive watches</h2><h3>How do I adjust the dive watch strap?</h3><p>It depends on the type of strap. For bracelets, you have to physically remove links to make large adjustments, and then use a diver's extension if you want to slip the watch over a wetsuit. For rubber or silicone straps, it can be as simple as buckling the strap like a belt, since that's often how those are secured. Aftermarket clasps can also be used which offer things like a ratcheting diver's extension, which allows for on-the-fly adjustment.</p><h3>How do I use a dive watch?</h3><p>To use a dive watch, find out how many minutes of air you have in your tank, and set the chevron of the dive bezel on the minute that you engage the regulator of your tank, allowing you to accurately measure how much time has elapsed.</p><h3>How and when do I wear a dive watch?</h3><p>Overall, dive watches are more sporty than dressy, and therefore fit more casual occasions where you don't need to worry about fitting one underneath a shirt cuff. However, James Bond has established the trend of wearing a Rolex Submariner or Omega Seamaster on more formal occasions, so these days it's a lot less strict. Additionally, you can find dive-style watches appointed in precious metals and with jewels, and so it's a personal preference these days.</p><h3>What watches do divers actually wear?</h3><p>Dive computers are the lifesaving device of choice these days since they can do so much more than a dive watch can in terms of metrics. However, Seiko, Omega, Sinn, and especially Rolex remain status symbols and nods to tradition and heritage among divers, and especially among military divers.</p>"
throwing knives,"<h2>FAQs on throwing knives</h2><h3>How much do throwing knives cost?</h3><p>A good quality throwing knife usually runs around $10 a pop, but since most purpose-built throwing knives come in sets of three or more, you can expect to drop somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 for a decent set.</p><h3>Can any knife be a throwing knife?</h3><p>Technically, yes. That said, if you want to hit your target with any degree of consistency or accuracy, skip the Bowie knife, the karambit, and any other knife that isn't built for throwing. Your knives will also last longer if you go with a purpose-built blade since traditional knives break more easily during high-speed impacts with solid objects.</p><h3>Which knife is best for throwing?</h3><p>If you plan to throw often, find throwing knives that are tough, lightweight enough for you, and have a good balance. Knives in the eight to 12-inch range are a great option, especially for beginners.</p><h3>What is a good distance for throwing knives?</h3><p>This depends on what kind of knife you are throwing, what size your knife is, and what technique you use (spin vs. no-spin techniques). In competitive knife throwing, standard distances are 10 and 15 feet. For newbies, though, a good distance usually ranges between eight and 15 feet, again, depending on your chosen knife and technique.</p><h3>Are throwing knives good for self defense?</h3><p>I don't care how feasible Hollywood makes it look, relying on a throwing knife to save your life is foolhardy. Even if you manage to stick your assailant in the perfect spot, he won't drop then and there since he's already amped up on adrenaline (or meth). That's bad news for you, especially if he's armed.</p>"
hiking pants for men,"<h2>FAQs on hiking pants for men</h2><h3>What's the best fabric for hiking pants?</h3><p>Your hiking pants should use fabric that's some combination of durable, lightweight, breathable, water-resistant, and wind-blocking. Wool, polyester, and nylon are our preferred fabrics.</p><h3>What features should hiking pants have?</h3><p>The best feature is quality construction. Look for lightweight, durable fabric that dries quickly. Beyond that, think about things like pockets, oversized belt loops, and the ability to zip off the bottom of your pants.</p><h3>Do I need hiking pants, outdoor pants, functional pants, or tactical pants?</h3><p>These terms are pretty vague and there's a lot of overlap. Plenty of people like to hike in tactical pants or wear hiking pants to work. Focus on the specific features you care about and don't worry about the label.</p><h3>What cut is best for hiking?</h3><p>Fit is a matter of personal preference, but most people prefer something with a little bit of extra room. Pants that fit loose in the legs tend to breathe better and rub less than tight-fitting pants. The exception to that rule is legging-style pants like base layers and some athletic pants.</p><h3>What insulation should my hiking pants have?</h3><p>There is a time and place for insulated hiking pants, but we usually recommend something that's three-season comfortable. Adding a base layer or outer layer to suit the weather is always an option and lets you get more use out of your clothing.</p><h3>Are compression pants good for hiking?</h3><p>Tight-fitting athletic pants can be worn for hikingInstagram has plenty of documentation to support that (although we're skeptical about how many miles some of those people actually cover). Whether or not you go that route is a matter of personal style.</p>"
digital watches,"<h2>FAQs about digital watches</h2><h3>What should I look for when buying a digital watch?</h3><p>When buying a digital watch, you should look for many of the same characteristics that you would when buying an analog watch. Things like legibility, durability, and ergonomics matter just as much here, but they take different forms, like the size of the numbers on the display, the backlight, and how easy it is to switch between the functions on these watches.</p><h3>What are the disadvantages of digital watches?</h3><p>One of the biggest disadvantages of digital watches has been that you can't view the time easily in low light without pressing a button, meaning it's one extra step to check the time in low light. This is extra concerning for SCUBA divers, who can't use the pushers on their watches underwater for fear of water infiltration. Some watches solve this by having a motion sensor that triggers the backlight when you flick your wrist.</p><h3>Are smartwatches and digital watches the same?</h3><p>Technically, smartwatches are just digital watches with improved computing power and connectivity, and some digital watches blur the line with things like Bluetooth, step counters, GPS chips, and other resources. However, colloquially, smartwatches refer to wrist-mounted devices that mimic the functions of a cellular device or computer, whereas digital watches usually refer to devices that are primarily for telling the time.</p><h3>What is better, a digital watch or a normal watch?</h3><p>Digital watches are easier to read precisely and quickly, down to the second, but analog watches are generally regarded as looking nicer, and certain roles like diver's watches require that the watch be analog to facilitate the use of a dive time bezel.</p>"
coolers for camping,"<h2>FAQs on coolers for camping</h2><h3>Why is bringing a cooler important?</h3><p>Coolers are your best bet for keeping drinks cool during the summer. They're also critical if you bring raw meat to cook at your campsite. Meat and dairy need to be refrigerated to prevent foodborne illness. We recommend throwing in a thermometer so you can monitor the interior temperature.</p><h3>What's the best way to fill a cooler?</h3><p>Pack your food and drinks first. It's not a bad idea to put packages of uncooked meat on the bottom, just in case they leak. Cold air is heavy, so pack ice on top of your food to get the most out of it. Don't skimp on the ice, either. Stack it as thick as you can.</p><h3>Should I drain the water from my cooler?</h3><p>This is a hotly contested debate, but we're with Adventure Journal on this onedon't do it. As long as the water is cooler than the ambient air, it's less of a problem than the air that will take its place when you drain it.</p><h3>How can I take care of my camping cooler?</h3><p>You obviously want to protect your cooler against impacts. In between uses, give it a thorough scrubbing with mild dish soap and warm water. That should be all it takes to keep your cooler fresh and ready for the next trip.</p><h3>Are camping coolers bear-proof?</h3><p>No. Cars aren't even bear-proof.</p><h3>How can I keep my cooler cold longer?</h3><p>Coolers do a great job of keeping their internal temperature low, but they can't actively lower it. To get the most out of your cooler, pack lots of ice and don't open the lid any longer than is necessary.</p>"
water bottles,"<h2>FAQs about water bottles</h2><h3>What is the healthiest water bottle to use?</h3><p>The healthiest water bottle is a clean one. If you're really concerned about contaminants in your water, a stainless steel bottle with a clean, high-quality filter is your best bet.</p><h3>Are stainless steel bottles better than plastic?</h3><p>Stainless steel water bottles are easier to clean and almost always more durable than plastic ones. They do tend to be heavier, though.</p><h3>How long do metal water bottles last?</h3><p> A stainless steel water bottle should last as long as you're willing to take care of it. They're extremely durable.</p><h3>Can you refrigerate stainless steel water bottles?</h3><p>Sure, just remember that insulated stainless steel water bottles will work against you if you're trying to cool your drink down by putting it in the fridge. In that case, use another container or leave the lid open.</p><h3>Can you boil water in a water bottle?</h3><p>Even though some plastic water bottles can hold boiling water, they shouldn't be exposed to heat long enough to bring it to a boil. Dual-walled stainless steel water bottles will act as a barrier to heat and may explode. Only single-walled stainless steel bottles are safe for boiling water.</p><h3>How often should you change your water bottle?</h3><p>Regular cleaning goes a long way, but even that can't keep some water bottles in good shape forever. A good sniff will tell you when it's time to say goodbye to your water bottle.</p><h3>Is it OK to put lemon in a stainless steel water bottle?</h3><p>Sure, live your dream. Stainless steel does a great job of storing various flavors without absorbing them and passing them on.</p>"
foam rollers,"<h2>FAQs about foam rollers</h2><h3>How much do foam rollers cost?</h3><p>You can buy a good, basic foam roller for $15 to $20, but these are typically going to be solid core, polypropylene rollers with not much to offer in the way of surface texture. If you're looking for a roller with some texture or a nice grid pattern, expect to pay between $30 and $45. Once you get above $45, you start to get into the foam rollers that offer extra features, such as vibration and collapsibility. These can range up over $100.</p><h3>Why does using foam rollers hurt?</h3><p>When you start using a foam roller, you should expect it to hurt. In order to work out the tension of your muscles, you are applying pressure in order to elongate that tissue and/or work out existing knots that can form during workouts. Have no fear, though, because it's supposed to hurt and the results are worth it. Prolonged pressure on muscle knots will cause them to release, and provide much-needed relief. Consistent use of your foam roller can help elongate muscles resulting in fewer injuries and less soreness.</p><h3>Can foam rolling be harmful?</h3><p>Yes, but only in the way that anything can be harmful if not used correctly. Before using a foam roller, you should try to identify the cause of any pain or injury you might have. Once identified, be reasonably sure that a foam roller could be a potential solution. You won't use a foam roller to treat a torn ACL or a herniated disk in your back. Be smart and consult a physician if you're unsure.</p>"
ankle holsters,"<h2>FAQs on ankle holsters</h2><h3>Are ankle holsters good for concealed carry?</h3><p>Generally, yes. Unless you wear shorts or trim/tight jeans all the time, an ankle holster can be a solid CCW holster option. Just make sure you practice your draw stroke (safely) as it is much less natural than drawing from the waistband.</p><h3>Are ankle holsters uncomfortable?</h3><p>Relative to not carrying at all, every CCW holster is uncomfortable, at least to some degree. With ankle holsters, the biggest detractors to comfort are sweat, especially with holsters sporting neoprene bands, and the extra weight at your ankle. Before wearing your holster in public, get used to the new feeling at home, and while you're at it, practice walking normally!</p><h3>Which leg do you wear an ankle holster on?</h3><p>With rare exceptions, the best place to position your ankle holster is on the inside leg of your non-dominant side. For a right-handed individual, this would be the inside of the left ankle. Also, consider rotating the firearm slightly forward to minimize the likelihood of kicking the firearm/holster while you walk.</p><h3>Can you open carry on your ankle?</h3><p>Even if open carry is legal in your state, then don't do it. You will have too little control over your firearm (especially around little people), and if you were to need it, you'd very likely get nailed before you could even touch it. Bad dudes don't care.</p><h3>Can you wear an ankle holster with boots?</h3><p>Yes, depending on the holster. Some holsters were designed specifically with boot wearers in mind while others were created for use by detectives, white-collar workers, and other bootless individuals.</p>"
holsters for sig p365,"<h2>FAQs about SIG P365 holsters</h2><h3>What is the difference between the P365 and the P365 SAS?</h3><p>The SAS (SIG Anti-Snag) is a streamlined, no-snag version of the P365. Most notably, the front sight is completely absent, replaced with a fiber optic/tritium sight mounted flush in the rear of the slide. The goal is to prevent the gun from catching on anything during the draw. The downside is that the lack of a front sight reduces accuracy and, therefore, the effective range of the pistol.</p><h3>Can you ankle-carry a SIG P365?</h3><p>Yes, you can, and there are several ankle holsters available. Most ankle holsters are not pistol-specific, but rather they're made of leather or neoprene and are either one-size-fits-most or require you to order a specific holster size (but not specific to a particular pistol). See above for limitations of ankle holsters.</p><h3>Can you put a red dot on a SIG P365?</h3><p>Absotively! Wait - posolutely! SIG makes the P365 X and the P365 Romeo Zero. The X comes with a removable plate that reveals a red dot mounting location, and the Romeo Zero comes with the SIG red dot sight of the same name pre-installed.</p><h3>What is appendix carry?</h3><p>When you're appendix-carrying, you have an IWB holster positioned between roughly 11- and one-o'clock if 12 o'clock is your belly button. Appendix-carry boasts excellent concealability and a more natural draw stroke than strong-side carry, but most will agree that it is somewhat less comfortable as you're either getting poked in the family jewels or thigh by the muzzle, or your baby bump is rubbing on/getting violated by the grip.<br/>"
sleeping bags,"<h2>FAQs about sleeping bags</h2><h3>How do I wash a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Careful spot-cleaning is usually the best option. When you're done, hang the bag in a well-ventilated area even if you're confident it's completely dry. This is also the best way to store your sleeping bag.</p><h3>How much does a sleeping bag cost?</h3><p>As with anything, you get what you pay for. Some entry-level sleeping bags cost as little as $30. That's fine for sleeping indoors, but you'll want something warmer for outdoor camping. Some of our favorite sleeping bags cost between $200 and $300.</p><h3>How do I measure for a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Sleeping bags don't have a lot of variation in size, but it's important to find a good fit. The measurements provided by manufacturers refer to the sleeping bag itself, not the person it's intended for. Measure your height, chest, and hips, then give yourself some extra room.</p><h3>Can you put a sleeping bag in the dryer?</h3><p>Every sleeping bag will have its own care and handling instructions. Read them carefully to avoid damaging yours.</p><h3>How should I store my sleeping bag?</h3><p>If you visit your local outfitter, you'll see sleeping bags hanging in the open. That's not just for display; it's the best way to preserve the insulation. Hang your sleeping bag in the closet or in a loose, breathable bag rather than packing it away in its compression sack.</p><h3>What are sleeping bags made of?</h3><p>There are several layers to sleeping bags: a breathable inner layer, insulation, and a more durable exterior. Insulation can be down or synthetic, and the other layers typically use lightweight synthetic materials.</p>"
handgun safes,"<h2>FAQs on handgun safes</h2><h3>What is the most difficult gun safe to break into?</h3><p>There probably isn't a specific answer to this question, but there is a list of qualities. The most difficult gun safe to break into is one that's in a secure location, constructed from thick steel, and equipped with a dependable lock.</p><h3>Where should I put a pistol safe?</h3><p>There are two schools of thought here. School A is concerned about nefarious characters coming for them, and they say to put safes anywhere/everywhere that you might need a firearm. School B says to put them somewhere that isn't obvious, because if it isn't noticed, it's less likely to be stolen. For most people, finding a place in your bedroom that is easily accessible is ideal.</p><h3>Where should I keep my gun when I sleep?</h3><p>Keep it somewhere secure to prevent unauthorized access by children, guests, or intruders.</p><h3>Is it OK to keep a gun loaded?</h3><p>It depends. Legally speaking, the District of Columbia is the only place that has rules regarding unloading your firearms before storing them, but some states have laws that require you to lock up your firearms when they're not in use, according to the Giffords Law Center. Otherwise, most gun groups - pro- and anti- - recommend storing your guns unloaded, locked up, and away from ammo, and some groups suggest you develop a storage plan in case you want to access it in a self-defense scenario.</p><h3>What should I put in my gun safe?</h3><p>Your pistol, grandma's pearls, silver bullets, and anything else you want to limit access to.</p>"
hydration bladders,"<h2>FAQs on hydration bladders</h2><h3>How do I clean a hydration bladder?</h3><p>While each bladder may come with a different cleaning regime, you will generally rinse the tube out by filling the reservoir with a cleaning solution and then wash the reservoir out by scrubbing it with mild dish soap.</p><h3>How do I dry a hydration bladder?</h3><p>Disassemble all pieces of the bladder, and either hang the reservoir and tube or prop them upside down. You can also use a rag to dry out the inside of the reservoir, or turn it inside-out, if the model allows.</p><h3>How do I pack a hydration bladder?</h3><p>If a hydration bladder doesn't have any backbone that gives it structure, make sure to put it in your pack first, before anything else. If it does have a backbone, it doesn't matter as much when you pack it, since you can typically still squeeze it in full backpacking packs. Make sure to put the bladder in the sleeve that rests closest to your back for maximum comfort and accessibility.</p><h3>What size hydration bladder should I get?</h3><p>It depends on what activities you use. For easy day trips running, hiking or skiing, you shouldn't need more than two liters. But, if you plan to backpack in places with scarce water sources, bump up to three liters, at least.</p><h3>Can you freeze water in a hydration bladder?</h3><p>Yes, just don't fill it all the way, because ice expands and it could split open the plastic material. If you are looking to prevent your water from freezing, look towards insulated options, like the HydraPak HydraSleeve.</p>"
power racks,"<h2>FAQs on power racks</h2><h3>What's the difference between a squat rack and a power rack?</h3><p>These terms are frequently used interchangeably (e.g., don't curl in the squat rack). Technically, squat racks use an open, two-post design and power racks place the lifter in the middle of a four-post cage. For most people, both types of rack can be used effectively.</p><h3>What kind of exercises can I perform on a power rack?</h3><p>Power racks are designed to provide mechanical safety measures during the squat. The same safety and convenience are also great for the bench press, overhead press, rack pull, and pull-ups (so long as no one is waiting to actually squat).</p><h3>What are the must-have accessories to buy with a power rack?</h3><p>Most power racks come with everything you need. If not, you'll want to make sure you have safety bars or straps, hooks to hold the bar, and some way to store your plates in an organized way.</p><h3>Should I buy a bench for my power rack?</h3><p>If you're building a home gym, adding a bench to your power rack is a great investment. Most power racks feature holes specifically positioned to allow safety bars and J-hooks to be used for the bench press.</p><h3>Are power racks worth it?</h3><p>A power rack might be the best way to turn your home gym into a serious fitness facility. With a power rack, there are very few exercises you can't do. They aren't cheap, but the money you'll save on a gym membership will pay off the investment in no time.</p>"
gun belts,"<h2>FAQs on gun belts</h2><h3>What makes a good gun belt?</h3><p>A good gun belt should be rigid enough to support your equipment, while also being flexible enough to move with your body. It should also be stable when worn with an inner belt, to prevent the belt from moving when you go to draw a magazine. All gun belts on this list satisfy this need.</p><h3>What kind of gun belt should I get?</h3><p>Your gun belt should be scaled to your needs. If you're not someone who needs to carry more than three rifles magazines or a few items of gear on a vest, then you can possibly do without. If you're a law enforcement officer whose department requires you to wear all weapons and ammo on a belt, then a quality gunfighter belt is essential. The same goes for people who are in military occupations where they have to wear a pack with kidney straps, as with my Mystery Ranch Observed Fires Pack.</p><h3>Does a gun belt make a difference?</h3><p>A quality gun belt absolutely makes the difference between efficient gear carrying and more awkward options, whether they be carrying all your ammo and gear on a plate carrier or chest rig, or weaving holsters and ammo pouches directly into a conventional belt.</p><h3>Is a gun belt worth it?</h3><p>For those who need an easy-on and easy-off option to carry all of their essential gear, and that is separate from a plate carrier or chest rig, a quality gun belt is absolutely essential.</p>"
rooftop tents,"<h2>FAQs on rooftop tents</h2><h3>What are the benefits of rooftop tents?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are popular because they're easy to set up in a short amount of time. They also get your sleeping area off the ground which adds a layer of protection against water and wildlife. The views aren't bad, either.</p><h3>What are the drawbacks of rooftop tents?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are more awkward to get in and out of because you have to climb a ladder. They also require you to keep your vehicle parked once they're up. Cost is another disadvantage compared to ground tents, but you may find that the pros outweigh the cons.</p><h3>Can I put a rooftop tent on my car?</h3><p>You bet! Rooftop tents are built to mount on roof racks, not the roof itself. As long as you have an adequate support structure, you can mount a rooftop tent to your car. As always, check with the manufacturer if you have any concerns.</p><h3>Why are rooftop tents so damn expensive?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are a lot more complicated to build than traditional tents. You also have to remember that they're in use all the time. Even when a rooftop tent is collapsed, it's still subjected to high speeds and the elements as long as it's on your vehicle.</p><h3>How sturdy are rooftop tents?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are tough by design. They're very compact when collapsed, and there isn't that much stress on them when they're popped up. The weak point could very well be the roof rack you mount them on.</p>"
ultralight sleeping bags,"<h2>FAQs about ultralight sleeping bags</h2><h3>How much should an ultralight sleeping bag weigh?</h3><p>I consider any bag under 25 ounces to be an ultra-lightweight sleeping bag.</p><h3>Is four pounds heavy for a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Yes. Four pounds is a lot for a sleeping bag. If you're car camping or just hiking a short distance, it might not matter much. Typically, bags weighing four pounds or more are roomier and more comfortable. If you're going to be hiking long distances over multiple days, you'll want the lightest bag you can afford. This is why I included the Mountain Hardwear Bishop Pass 30 as an option. At 28 ounces, it's a lightweight bag, but not a UL bag, but it compresses about as small as a UL bag and costs hundreds less.</p><h3>Should I get a 15- or 30-degree ultralight sleeping bag?</h3><p>It depends on how cold it will be where and when you are camping out. Typically, 30-degree bags are considered three-season (late spring, summer, and early fall) bags in most parts. If you are a cold sleeper, you might want a 20- or 15-degree bag. If you are looking to camp during the winter, you might opt for a four-season bag which might be a zero or negative-five-degree bag.</p><h3>Is goose down good for UL sleeping bags?</h3><p>Yes. Goose down is the preferred insulation for UL bags. Look for 800 power fill rated down or higher to get the most loft for the least weight. Note: It's also the most expensive down.</p>"
ellipticals,"<h2>FAQs on ellipticals</h2><h3>Should I go with a front drive or rear drive elliptical</h3><p>This depends on your workout goals. Front-drive machines tend to offer more of a ""stair-stepper"" motion and can be useful when training for uphill hikes and climbing. Rear-drive ellipticals tend to have a flatter, horizontal movement that mimics standard walks or runs.</p><h3>Should I buy an elliptical with a heavier flywheel?</h3><p>If you can, yes. The heavier the flywheel, the smoother and quieter the ride will be, but keep in mind, as the flywheel size increase, the price typically does too. Also, don't get too hung up on the flywheel. There are some quality machines out there that don't even use a flywheel.</p><h3>Why is stride length important?</h3><p>Stride length will determine how comfortable you are on the elliptical. If the stride length is too short, your experience will feel choppy and awkward. If it's too long, you may struggle and over-extend. Make sure you pick a stride length appropriate for your height.</p><h3>What is the best type of resistance system?</h3><p>The eddy current resistance system is the most common in higher-end machines. The eddy current resistance system works by moving an electromagnet closer or farther away from the flywheel to change the resistance respectively. Because it is controlled via electric current, there are fewer moving parts and therefore fewer opportunities for performance issues.</p><h3>What is an elliptical crosstrainer?</h3><p>Elliptical cross trainers are machines that have ergonomically moving arm handles that allow the user to get an upper-body workout also.</p>"
running headphones,"<h2>FAQs on running headphones</h2><h3>How do you know if running earbuds fit well?</h3><p>Your earbuds should feel snug and comfortable in your ear, so when you shake your head, they won't fall out. With most earbuds, you will also notice that - if they fit properly - they are blocking out some surrounding noise. If your earbuds come with several tips and/or ear fins, make sure to customize them accordingly before taking off on a run.</p><h3>Do headphones for running need to be water-resistant?</h3><p>They don't have to be water-resistant, but this can help if you are a heavy sweater or if you run in the rain. Check out the waterproof rating on headphones before purchasing, and make sure to spring for a weatherproof option if you know you will be running in downpours.</p><h3>Do software features matter when picking out workout headphones?</h3><p>It depends on what you are in the market for. Some of our picks for running headphones have a corresponding app with features like adjusting the bass levels or locating your earbuds if lost. However, headphones with additional software features are typically pricier, so if you are someone that just goes on a jog once in a while, these may not be as important.</p><h3>Do headphones fall off when running?</h3><p>Yes, headphones can fall out while running, so make sure to find a fit that works for you. Many headphones now come with several earbud tips and/or ear fins, so you can customize them to fit your ears.</p>"
air mattresses for camping,"<h2>FAQs on air mattresses for camping</h2><h3>Why bother with a camping mattress?</h3><p>A good night of sleep will impact your mood, emotion regulation, and the recovery of your muscles, so investing in a high-quality mattress can make or break a camping trip. Your body and fellow campers will thank you for it.</p><h3>How do I choose a mattress for camping?</h3><p>You should consider the length of time and frequency you plan to use it as well as where and in what weather conditions. While you could probably get away with using plastic pool floaties for one night on a concrete tent pad, that isn't a practical solution for multi-day trips. If you are a thru- or long-distance hiker, you also want to consider weight, set up time, and packed size.</p><h3>What kinds of camping mattresses are there?</h3><p>Pool floaties aside, there are generally three types of camping mattresses: closed-cell, blow-up, and self-inflating. Each has its advantages when it comes to insulation, packed size, and overall comfort and ease of use. When, how often, and where you plan to camp should determine which type is best suited for your needs.</p><h3>How about the insulation aspect (R-value)?</h3><p>Simple answer. Don't skimp on the R-value if getting a good night's rest is important to you in the wilderness. Sleeping on a camping mattress with a high R-value won't make you feel hot, but it will provide a layer of protection between you and the cold ground, making for a much more comfortable night.</p>"
gun oils,"<h2>FAQs on gun oils</h2><h3>What gun oil does the U.S. military use?</h3><p>The U.S. military utilizes CLP. As an all-in-one oil, it's easy to store, transport, carry, and use.</p><h3>Should I oil the barrel of my gun?</h3><p>Yes. For optimal protection and performance, one should apply oil to the inside and outside of a barrel. Don't go overboard though, oil collects dirt when applied too heavily.</p><h3>What is the best gun oil to prevent rust?</h3><p>Any gun oil that is a protectant. Most CLPs work just fine. The biggest cause of rust is water though, so keep that gun dry.</p><h3>Can I use motor oil on my gun?</h3><p>No. You should avoid doing this. Motor oil is designed for cars and would work fine as a lubricant if shit hits the fan and you can't find gun oil, but it won't clean or protect your gun.</p><h3>Can I clean my gun with soap and water?</h3><p>Yes, but you need to understand the context before you do. You should use soap and water to remove corrosive chemicals (like after shooting some inexpensive Russian surplus ammo) or if you want to strip away the lubrication. However, you should immediately rinse and dry afterward, and then apply a light coat of lubrication to protect your firearm.</p><h3>Is WD-40 safe to use on guns?</h3><p>Yes, but I wouldn't rely on it. It is a solvent only and designed to break things down. If you did use it, you would still need a lubricant and protectant.</p>"
solar panels for camping,"<h2>FAQs about solar panels for camping</h2><h3>What size solar panel is good for camping?</h3><p>It depends on what you need to charge, how much power you need, and how fast you need it to charge. In general, the greater the demand, the bigger the panel you'll need in terms of watts produced.</p><h3>What will a 200-watt solar panel cost?</h3><p>About $200 to $250 for most 200W panels.</p><h3>Are solar panels for camping worth it?</h3><p>Yes, especially if you are multi-day backpacking and want to cut weight.</p><h3>Can a solar panel run a camping fridge?</h3><p>Sure, if you get a big enough panel. You'll also probably need a power inverter, too.</p><h3>Is there a 500-watt solar panel?</h3><p>You betcha. See the 550W panel we reviewed for RVs.</p><h3>How much solar power do I need for a camper?</h3><p>It depends on what you need to charge. If you are backpacking and just need to charge a cell phone and smartwatch or GPS, you can probably get away with a 5- or 10-watt panel. If you are car camping at the KOA and want to power larger devices, you'll probably want a 50- to 200-watt panel depending on how much electronic junk you bring.</p><h3>How long does a portable solar panel last?</h3><p>This depends on the amount of abuse the panel takes. Generally speaking, panels are designed to last 20 to 30 years, but they degrade over time. The National Renewable Energy Lab found that, on average, solar panel output falls by 0.8 percent each year.</p>"
shooting gloves,"<h2>FAQs for shooting gloves</h2><h3>Can anyone use shooting gloves?</h3><p>Anyone can, and (in my opinion) should, use shooting gloves. No matter which glove you choose, having that added layer of protection will protect you from potential lacerations, burns, the elements, and,most importantly, lead poisoning. Besides, training with gloves on enables you to shoot well with them on or off, while training without doesn't.</p><h3>How tight should shooting gloves be?</h3><p>Most manufacturers publish a sizing guide to help you pick what size is right for you. Personally, I prefer my gloves tight enough where it moves with my hands (and not away from them), but not so tight to where blood circulation is getting cut off.</p><h3>Are shooting gloves easy to clean?</h3><p>It depends. If you're like me, those suckers go into the washing machine and then hang dry or sit out in the sun. If you are the type to care a little more about your gear, I recommend the gentler approach: hand-washing.</p><h3>Are shooting gloves worth it?</h3><p>Definitely! As a recent convert from the ""no glove gang,"" I have seen/endured enough pain in my hands to tell you that shooting gloves are worth every penny. Have you tried shooting barehanded in freezing rain? Extremely unpleasant.</p><h3>What shooting gloves does the military use?</h3><p>The U.S. military historically issued pretty unremarkable leather gloves, generally speaking. However, if you happen to stumble on any given field exercise, you'll almost certainly find several pairs ofMechanix and/or Oakley (or Oakley knock-off) gloves.<br/>"
car gun safes,"<h2>FAQs on car gun safes</h2><h3>Can you keep a gun in a glove box?</h3><p>From a safety standpoint, most experts do NOT recommend storing a gun in the glove box, especially if it's not a locking glove box. From a legal standpoint, the country is divided on the issue. However, in most states, you can conceal a firearm in your glove box if you are permitted to concealed carry.</p><h3>What size should my vehicle gun safe be?</h3><p>That is completely up to your specific use case. Look at one that will fit your firearm(s). How many mags will you carry? Does it have large accessories? Then check where you intend to store it. Find a safe with the right dimensions for that spot.</p><h3>What's the safest way to transport a firearm in a vehicle?</h3><p>Unless you're specifically (and legally) keeping it in your car for defense purposes, it shouldn't be loaded and hot. Keep it locked up in a hard case and away from where passengers or thieves could tamper with it. It should be unloaded with ammo stored away from the gun.</p><h3>What is the difference between a car gun safe and a console safe?</h3><p>A car gun safe encompasses most lockable storage solutions whereas console vaults/safes specifically refer to fixed storage within a vehicle's center console. When installed, it will replace or take up a good chunk of the original space with a safe that's integrated with the car and out of sight.<br/>"
spotting scope tripods,"<h2>FAQs about spotting scope tripods</h2><h3>Will any tripod work with a spotting scope?</h3><p>Yes, although an adapter may be required to mate the scope to the top attachment of the tripod based on the thread pitch of the stud. We recommend purchasing a quick-release locking plate of a type compatible with the top attachment of the tripod.</p><h3>Can you hold a spotting scope?</h3><p>No. Even though spotting scopes are variable power, the minimum magnification level is generally above 10x which is far too high to hold steady without external support.</p><h3>How do spotting scopes attach to tripods?</h3><p>While it's generally possible to screw the spotting scope directly to the top attachment stud of a tripod, the preferred method is to use a quick-release locking plate. The plate consists of two parts, one which is permanently mounted to the tripod and the other to the base of the scope.</p><h3>Can you use binoculars as a spotting scope?</h3><p>No. Most binoculars have a smaller objective lens and considerably less magnification than a spotting scope and lack a reticle. The purpose of binoculars is to scan for potential targets, then use the spotting scope to zoom in on the target of interest.</p><h3>Are spotting scope mounts universal?</h3><p>No. You should check and make sure that the stud size and thread pitch between your spotting scope and tripod match. If you intend to purchase a quick-release locking plate, it should be of the type that is supported by your tripod's manufacturer.</p>"
closet gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about closet gun safes</h2><h3>Will a gun safe damage carpeting in my closet?</h3><p>Yes. Over time, heavy objects will cause indentations and flatten the carpet on which they stand. However, things like vacuuming and steaming the carpet, or even placing an ice cube on the carpet, can lift up the crushed fibers and help restore the carpet towards its original state.</p><h3>Is the closet a good place to put a gun safe?</h3><p>A closet is an excellent place for a gun safe, especially for those living in smaller homes where floor space is at a premium. Placing a safe in a closet keeps the safe out of sight, keeping your firearms or valuables relatively easy to access, while not giving up space in other parts of the home.</p><h3>What size of gun safe is suitable for my firearm?</h3><p>That is dependent on the type of firearm. Shotguns and hunting rifles are longer than AR-15s and require a taller gun safe, while pistols can fit into safes that are far smaller.</p><h3>Do gun safes need to be climate-controlled?</h3><p>That depends. If the location where the safe is kept is climate-controlled, the safe will maintain a similar temperature. However, if you live in a location that sees high humidity, then it may present a rusting issue. To combat this, safes may be modified so that power can be run inside the safe. From there, a small dehumidifier can be installed to help prevent mold and rust.</p>"
rucking backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about rucking backpacks</h2><h3>Do you need a special backpack for rucking?</h3><p>Not at all. You choose what works best for you when rucking.</p><h3>Does rucking build back muscle?</h3><p>Yes, and shoulder muscle as well.</p><h3>How much weight can you ruck with?</h3><p>Depending on the quality of the pack and type of frame, your ability to carry and move with the weight, you may find your answer. In the military, it is typical to carry anywhere from 55 to 80 pounds of gear depending on the mission or training outcome.</p><h3>What should I look for in a ruck pack?</h3><p>Look for high-quality material that can withstand stress, weight, and wear, along with reinforced stitching and heavily padded shoulder straps. A waist belt and compression straps are important, not to mention a frame (internal or otherwise) that can help immensely in carrying heavy loads without hurting your back.</p><h3>What's the difference between a rucksack and backpack?</h3><p>Rucksacks are typically designed for heavier loads with the hiker or military member in mind. Backpacks can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and purposes.</p><h3>What rucksack does the military use?</h3><p>Most of the Army use the modular lightweight load-carrying equipment MOLLE II packs. The Marine Corps uses a similar version called the Improved Load-Bearing Equipment, or ILBE.</p><h3>What are the benefits of rucking?</h3><p>With a heavy load on your body and walking at a brisk pace, you pick up a cardio-like exercise. It helps build strength in your legs, back, and shoulders.</p>"
utility knives,"<h2>FAQs on utility knives</h2><h3>How do you use a utility knife?</h3><p>Carefully. No, really. All the normal basic safety rules for working with a sharp tool apply. Never cut towards yourself or your hand, always cut away from you. Never cut when anyone is within your reach with the knife extended: It's colloquially known as the blood circle for a reason.</p><h3>Can a utility knife cut wood?</h3><p>While almost any knife that isn't dull can cut wood, there are knives specifically designed for cutting and carving wood that will do it much better than, say, a box-cutter. The Japanese Kiridashi is a great example of a knife specifically designed for this.</p><h3>How should I maintain my utility knife?</h3><p>That depends on a couple of factors, including steel type, intended use, environment, and whether it is a folder or fixed-blade. If it's made using high carbon steel, you'll want to keep it clean and dry to prevent any dirt buildup from allowing moisture to collect and cause rust. You'll also want to dry off the blade as soon as possible after being exposed to water, and wipe it down every other week or so with a thin layer of oil - more frequently if you live in a humid or salty environment. Modern stainless steels require drastically less maintenance in comparison, but you'll still want to keep them clean and dry, and lightly oil them occasionally if you're in a marine environment.</p>"
concealed carry holsters for women,"<h2>FAQs about concealed carry holsters</h2><h3>Is it hard to conceal-carry a larger gun?</h3><p>As long as a good holster is selected and it is worn with a proper cover garment, concealing a larger or full-size gun can be done even by small-framed people.</p><h3>What's the deal with ankle carry?</h3><p>Ankle carry can be useful when using a gun with a short grip such as a Glock 26 or a small revolver, but is not as common these days.</p><h3>What options are there for plus-sized bodies?</h3><p>The PHLster Enigma can be a great option as long as the waist strap and leg leash fit. Holsters that are designed to be carried in the three- to five-o'clock position can also be more comfortable than appendix carry.</p><h3>Are belly bands or thigh holsters any good?</h3><p>Generally speaking, no. These types of holsters tend to be made out of a flexible fabric that doesn't offer any sort of protection for the trigger.</p><h3>I don't want to carry on my body, so can I keep my gun in my purse?</h3><p>It depends. It can be difficult to draw a pistol from most off-the-shelf purses, but there are several companies making purses and bags designed with a pocket or pockets meant to hold a firearm. Either way, the other concern is retaining control of the purse and, in turn, your pistol. As is the case with any style of concealed carry, off-body carry is something you'll have to train for.</p>"
self defense keychains,"<h2>FAQs about self-defense keychains</h2><h3>How much do self-defense keychains cost?</h3><p>Thankfully, these items are defensive tools that won't break the bank in the manner a firearm or quality standard-length blade would. Nearly all defensive keychains sell between $10 and $20, with multi-item bundle deals being sold from $20 to $30. Our Best Value-winning Sabre Pepper Spray stickers for an inviting $10.</p><h3>Are self-defense keychains legal everywhere?</h3><p>It depends on the method of defense and location. Kubotans are generally legal in all U.S. states, but some jurisdictions may pose minor restrictions. Spiked kubotans are illegal in the U.K., with blunt variants still hotly debated. And they're too short to be legal in Canada. Knives will fall under the same restrictions as other blades, just as plastic knuckle dusters are bunched in with brass knuckles.</p><h3>Can I take self-defense keychains on a plane?</h3><p>Just about all defensive keychains will face the same travel restrictions on planes, meaning knives and kubotans are often barred from carry-ons and can only be checked in. Pepper spray containers up to four ounces may also be checked in. Stun guns and tasers must be rendered inoperable.</p><h3>How effective are self-defense keychains?</h3><p>Like any weapon in the hand of a well-versed individual, any defense tool, no matter how small or simple, can be used as a brutal force multiplier. Even basic and polarizing devices such as kubotans can deliver painful jabs to pressure points and fleshy areas, greatly discouraging attackers.</p>"
tactical wallets,"<h2>FAQs about tactical wallets</h2><h3>How much do tactical wallets cost?</h3><p>Price greatly varies as materials, functionality, and quality improve, but they'll generally cost more than most basic wallets. Entry models can be had for between $25 and $40. Higher-tier variants start at $70 to $80 and rapidly escalate into the hundreds. Specialized models with extra tools or carbon and titanium construction can easily eclipse $200 to $300. Our Best Value-winner starts at a friendly $21.</p><h3>What is ""RFID"" in wallets?</h3><p>RFID refers to ""Radio-Frequency IDentification."" For those genuinely interested, ensure the wallet that you're keen on purchasing shields against RFID. Many tactical wallets with hardened, metallic construction are usually RFID-proofed and can shield you from the admittedly unlikely occurrence of hackers scanning for credit cards or ID information.</p><h3>Are tactical wallets actually necessary?</h3><p>That depends on who you ask. It can be needless excess and a gimmicky flex to the average person. To those with active lifestyles who partake in strenuous trade jobs, extreme sports, or ahem, the military, tactical wallets will give them added protection, durability, and weatherproofing for all their valuables.</p><h3>What advantages do tactical wallets have over standard wallets?</h3><p>The overarching advantage that tactical wallets have is some degree of elevated functionality. Some offer far more generous storage than their less specialized kin, while others sacrifice a bit of space for easier carrying of the bare essentials. Many feature toughened construction with metal frames, casings, and even integrated multitools.</p>"
survival backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about survival backpacks</h2><h3>Is there a difference between a survival backpack and a bug-out backpack?</h3><p>Yes and no; the backpacks themselves can be identical. The contents inside are what differentiate a survival backpack from a bug-out backpack, although to the untrained individual, the differences may be almost indistinguishable.</p><h3>What should you always carry in a survival pack?</h3><p>Your survival backpack loadout will depend on your specific environment and situation. That said, all survival packs should include tools for a water filter or purifier, fire starters, shelter (skip the tent), medical care, comms, essential tools (including nav gear, like a map and compass), illumination, hygiene essentials (primarily baby wipes), food, and clothing essentials (mainly a skivvy roll and weather protection).</p><h3>How much weight can a survival backpack hold?</h3><p>Backpack weight capacities vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, although higher-end packs can handle up to 35 pounds. Your loadout (including the pack) should weigh no more than 20 percent of your body weight, so look for a pack that can handle slightly more than that.</p><h3>How long will a survival backpack last?</h3><p>A survival backpack's lifespan will depend heavily on many factors. A lightly loaded pack that never gets used could last indefinitely, while an overloaded pack that gets thrown around on a regular basis likely won't last more than a year or two. Of course, build quality also plays into the equation, so predictably, higher quality will last longer than a cheaper one.</p>"
karambit knives,"<h2>FAQs on karambit knives</h2><h3>Is it illegal to carry a karambit?</h3><p>Karambits are legal in most states, but it depends on your state's knife laws and local restrictions. Laws that limit your blade length or ban carrying fixed-blades concealed can severely limit your options. To check out your state's knife laws, click here.</p><h3>How dangerous are karambits?</h3><p>As dangerous as any other knife. Without proper self-defense training though, karambits become less dangerous to assailants and more dangerous to the user.</p><h3>Is a karambit used for self-defense or utility purposes?</h3><p>While the karambit is primarily designed for self-defense, it can still be used for many utility tasks. Some karambit models are designed primarily for self-defense, others for utility, and some as a happy medium between the two.</p><h3>I think karambits are cool, especially for doing tricks with. Should I get one?</h3><p>No. Spinning a karambit around your finger might look cool, but it serves no practical use, and you risk accidentally cutting yourself. There are a lot of important nerves, tendons, and blood vessels in your hands and forearms that are at risk if you play with your karambit. Karambits are tools, not toys.</p><h3>Are karambits good for self-defense?</h3><p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that successfully using a karambit for self-defense requires training, and a lot of it, so we'd heavily advise against getting one for self-defense unless you're willing to put in the time and effort to become proficient.</p>"
hiking poles,"<h2>FAQs on hiking poles</h2><h3>How do I use hiking poles?</h3><p>First, you need to decide whether you want one or two poles. Most people choose two. Next, you need to make sure you get the right length. Look for poles that allow your elbow to bend at 90 degrees when the pole tips are on the ground. There's also a technique for using the poles. Alternate hands and legs while moving and keep the tips behind the handles to help push you forward.</p><h3>Are hiking poles worth it?</h3><p>Hell, yes. I used to pooh pooh them, but once I tried them, I was sold and have used them for six years now. I won't go hiking without them because I feel much more stable and efficient when moving over rough terrain, especially when carrying a heavy pack.</p><h3>Why use hiking poles?</h3><p>Safety and efficiency. The further you go from the trailhead, the more self-reliant you need to be. Trekking poles help keep you upright and assist in preventing you from crashing and injuring yourself. Mine have saved me from twisted ankles, broken bones, and expensive dental repair work. Also, they add your arms into the propulsion system and help you move faster and more confidently over rough terrain.</p><h3>Can you take hiking poles on a plane?</h3><p>Yep. If you are going to travel, consider using Z style poles that fold up into packages about 15 inches in length or smaller.</p>"
rifle scopes,"<h2>FAQs on rifle scopes</h2><h3>How do I mount a rifle scope?</h3><p>Follow the instructions. Scopes attach in a variety of ways, and it typically involves ensuring you have the right eye relief and height, attaching the mount to the gun, and the scope to the mount.</p><h3>How do I zero a rifle scope?</h3><p>By following the directions? In general, you take the optic to the range, look at the target, and fire three rounds. Use the turrets to adjust the elevation and windage to adjust from where your projectiles impacted. Repeat until you are hitting the target.</p><h3>How much should I spend on a rifle scope?</h3><p>The general rule of thumb is to take the cost of the rifle and spend half of that on an optic. I advise you to spend as much as you can and just avoid crappy optics. However, don't expect premium performance from a budget optic.</p><p>When you buy a rifle, budget for an optic. Make that a consideration from the very beginning. Avoid spending less than $250 unless you find an insane sale or on Black Friday. Spending less than $250 on a magnified optic is a good way to get a not-so-great rifle scope.</p><p>Let's say you find yourself shopping for optics with a budget of $800 and are looking at a $600 optic and a $1,000 optic. I'd save up the extra $200 and go for the better glass every time.<br/>"
treadmills,"<h2>FAQs on treadmills</h2><h3>How much do treadmills cost?</h3><p>At the time of writing, the least expensive treadmill on this list cost $365. Premium home treadmills can easily reach $2,500, and commercial machines cost far more than that.</p><h3>Is a treadmill as good as walking or running outdoors?</h3><p>There's no replacement for running outdoors. Still, treadmills can absolutely improve your running. They give you more control over pace and incline, and likely offer far more versatility than the terrain outside your front door. It's also worth considering all the times the weather causes you to skip running altogether.</p><h3>How much does a treadmill weigh?</h3><p>Most treadmills weigh around 200 pounds. There's a lot of variation depending on materials, features, and electric motor size, so the heaviest treadmills can break 300 pounds while the lightest are less than 100 pounds.</p><h3>Don't treadmills take up a lot of space?</h3><p>All treadmills require a considerable amount of space, but they don't necessarily need it all the time. Some can be folded vertically when not in use to help you make the most of a small living space.</p><h3>I live in an apartment. Will a treadmill be too loud?</h3><p>Ah, so you've escaped the barracks, then. Good for you. It's possible to get a treadmill that's quieter, lighter, and more compact than in the past. If you prioritize noise levels when shopping, you can end up with a treadmill that's just as neighbor-friendly as your TV.</p>"
edc backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about EDC backpacks</h2><h3>How big should an EDC backpack be?</h3><p>The general consensus is that an EDC backpack should have a cargo capacity somewhere between 15 and 25 liters. That said, the size of your ideal pack will depend on what you regularly carry and any additional gear you may need for a given occasion, such as a rain jacket on a cloudy day.</p><h3>What is a tactical EDC backpack?</h3><p>A tactical EDC backpack is similar to a more traditional EDC bag but with extra features and tougher construction. In some cases, tactical EDC packs will sport PALS webbing that allows them to accept MOLLE pouches and accessories, and many tactical packs incorporate CCW pouches into their designs.</p><h3>What is a MOLLE backpack?</h3><p>A MOLLE backpack is any backpack equipped with PALS webbing which is designed to accept MOLLE pouches and accessories. Often, ""MOLLE"" and ""PALS"" are used interchangeably in product descriptions, so don't overthink it. MOLLE backpacks and accessories are 100 percent compatible with PALS gear and vice versa.</p><h3>What should I carry in my EDC backpack?</h3><p>EDC loadouts can vary dramatically from person to person due to factors such as daily activities, personal skill sets, and local climate. Write down what items you absolutely must have with you on a daily basis (keys, wallet, etc.) plus any activity-specific gear (laptop, rain jacket, etc.). Anything that won't reasonably fit into a pocket goes in your backpack.<br/>"
running sunglasses,"<h2>FAQs about running sunglasses</h2><h3>How much do running sunglasses cost?</h3><p>You can get $5 sunglasses if you have a $5 head. They're out there, and if they don't block UV light, they'll damage your eyes. I've seen quality sunglasses range from $25 to $50 for value glasses, $50 to $100 for mid-range glasses, and $100 and up for premium shades. If you have $470 to burn, Oakley will sell you a pair of Zeus.</p><h3>Why are there so many lens colors?</h3><p>Different lenses filter out different light in different amounts and affect how much contrast and what colors you see. Gray, green, and brown lenses are normally used for outdoor activities to cut glare and reduce eye fatigue. Gray and green typically don't distort color. Yellow and vermillion lenses are designed for use in low-light conditions and enhance contrast. This can be important when you are skiing or snowboarding, as they improve the visibility of objects in the landscape.</p><h3>What are sunglass lenses made of?</h3><p>Most are made from either polycarbonate or glass. Polycarbonate is lighter than glass, provides better impact protection, and delivers great clarity, but scratches more easily. Glass is heavier and resists scratches better. It's also more expensive.</p><h3>What about lens coatings?</h3><p>Sunglasses often come with one or more chemically-applied coatings to make them tougher to scratch, less likely to fog up, repel water, or mirrored to reflect more sunlight and reduce glare.</p>"
butterfly knives,"<h2>FAQs on butterfly knives</h2><h3>Are butterfly knives illegal?</h3><p>Kinda-sorta, not really. It's not an easy yes-or-no question, as it's dependent on your region. Typically, they may be mildly restricted for similar reasons as switchblades, but a handful of states and countries are known to be incredibly strict. Check your local laws regarding butterfly knives. Details on legality in different states can be found here.</p><h3>What is a good size for a butterfly knife?</h3><p>It depends on your use case. Most butterfly knives tend to range between three to over 4.5 inches. Larger knives (four inches and up) can be legitimately effective tools for defense or serious cutting. Smaller blades tend to be easier to conceal and have better weight balance for easier, faster flipping during tricks. This is highly subjective, however, as some prefer the momentum afforded by heavier knives to help move the blade.</p><h3>How old do you have to be to get a trainer butterfly knife?</h3><p>As they're not real knives with a sharpened edge, you can purchase a trainer butterfly knife at pretty much any age in most places. Some owners of trainers on the internet are noted to be as young as 12 years old, with parents in forums expressing interest in trainers for children even younger. Additionally, the lack of a sharp edge means trainers may be owned in places where the real deal may not be.</p>"
gun safes under 500,"<h2>FAQs about gun safes under $500</h2><h3>Are gun safes strong?</h3><p>Yes, if you pick a good, quality safe from a reputable manufacturer, thieves will have a very hard time getting inside and stealing your valuables.</p><h3>What is a good gun safe made out of?</h3><p>Most quality gun safes are made out of hardened steel outside and insulated with a material called Gypsum, which releases water vapor once heated to 262 degrees, keeping the inside of the safe cool.</p><h3>Can't someone just break into a gun safe?</h3><p>Yes, like a house or a vehicle, gun safes can be broken into as well, but if precautions are taken, it can be much harder and take a lot more time to get into the safe.</p><h3>How quickly can I get into a gun safe?</h3><p>This will depend on the type of lock your safe has, but numbered keypads and biometric fingerprint scanners are the fastest options on the market today and have become very reliable.</p><h3>Where should I put a gun safe in my home?</h3><p>This will depend on what you need your gun for. If it is a home defense gun, it should be placed wherever you can quickly get to it. The door should be free from obstacles (don't pile up boxes in front of the door) and there should be enough light to where you can see the lock or number keypad to unlock the door.</p>"
tactical boots,"<h2>FAQs on tactical boots</h2><h3>What's the difference between tactical and combat boots?</h3><p>Little more than the name. Combat boots are designed solely for military use, while tactical boots cater to first responders and government contractors as well as military service members.</p><h3>Can you run in tactical boots?</h3><p>Yes, although you won't be setting any records in the process. As such, we do recommend buying a dedicated pair of running boots for your combat fitness test or the obstacle course. Just remember that they won't hold up in the field, so save them for the proper time.</p><h3>How do you break in tactical boots?</h3><p>The fastest way to break in a new pair of boots is the wet method. This entails thoroughly soaking the boots inside and out, wearing them all day with two or three pairs of socks on (leather shrinks as it dries), then removing the insoles and letting both those and the boots dry.</p><h3>How tight should tactical boots be?</h3><p>A good pair of boots should fit nice and snug but should not be constricting. The Marine Corps recommends trying on a new pair of boots in the evening while wearing the socks you plan to wear with the boots. Make sure your toes have wiggle room (0.5 inches between your toes and the end of the boot) and that your heel doesn't lift more than 0.25 inches when you walk.</p>"
hunting boots,"<h2>FAQs about hunting boots</h2><h3>What's the difference between hunting boots and hiking boots?</h3><p>Hiking boots are lightweight footwear designed to withstand long treks over rough terrain. While some hunting boots fall into a similar category, others are designed to keep a hunter's feet warm while he or she sits for hours on end in cold and/or wet conditions waiting for game to arrive.</p><h3>How tall should my hunting boots be?</h3><p>It depends on what kind of hunting you plan to do. Duck hunters will want very tall boots while wading through ponds, marshes, or rivers. While backcountry big game hunters won't need knee-high boots, proper boots will provide plenty of ankle support to help transport heavy loads across rough terrain.</p><h3>How long should hunting boots last?</h3><p>If you prefer backcountry elk mountains high in the rough Rockies, your boots may last anywhere between half a season to two years even if they're high-end boots. With proper care and lighter use, one or two seasons could stretch to five years for a quality pair of hunting boots.</p><h3>Are expensive hunting boots worth it?</h3><p>If you hunt hard, fast, and often, then definitely plan to drop a few hundred bucks on a high-quality pair of boots. If, however, you only go on occasional non-backcountry hunts, you likely can go with a more budget-conscious boot. That said, never skimp on quality; skip the cheap stuff.</p>"
punching bags,"<h2>FAQs on punching bags</h2><h3>Which material is best for punching bags?</h3><p>Mechanically compressed textiles resist moisture and implement an even design for solid punches. It resists anchoring and hardening over time.</p><h3>What punching bags do professionals use?</h3><p>Professional fighters use a variety of bags like heavy bags, double-end bags, speed bags, power punch bags, and the specific brand they use varies depending on where they train. Some fighters use whatever bags their gym carries or use bags provided by a sponsor.</p><h3>Are gloves necessary for punching bags?</h3><p>Yes. You should wear gloves or some kind of protection if you plan on striking a bag for exercise. If you don't, you risk damaging or injuring your hands or wrists.</p><h3>Can you kick a punching bag?</h3><p>Yes, you can kick a punching bag, but know that some heavy bags are specifically designed for kicking, so the best practice is to understand how to use your equipment before doing something you're unsure about.</p><h3>Do punching bags build muscle?</h3><p>Not really. A punching bag will help you tone muscle in addition to giving you a cardiovascular workout, but it won't help you build muscle like, say, weightlifting.</p><h3>Are MMA gloves good for punching bags?</h3><p>Yes, but you should understand your equipment before doing something you're unsure about. Boxing gloves typically offer more padding and protection for your hands and wrists than MMA gloves, which are designed for grappling as well.</p>"
under bed gun safes,"<h2>FAQs on under-bed gun safes</h2><h3>What's the point of putting a gun safe under your bed?</h3><p>Two main reasons. First, since long guns do not fit inside bedside gun safes, it pays to keep one handy with an under-bed gun safe instead. And second, if you have a very small arsenal or limited storage options, a floor-mounted under-bed safe may be your best bet.</p><h3>Is it better to bolt my safe to the floor or to the bed?</h3><p>The floor. Your bed frame can be disassembled or hacked to pieces much more easily than your floor can. Plus, floor-mounted safes do a top-notch job of protecting their anchoring hardware as compared to bed-mounted safes.</p><h3>What can I put in my gun safe to absorb moisture?</h3><p>Depending on your safe, consider purchasing either a safe dehumidifier or a desiccant moisture absorber. Dehumidifiers require electricity, thus wiring options are a critical consideration. Desiccant containers do not require electricity but must be ""recharged"" in an oven once they get ""full.""</p><h3>Are under-bed gun safes fireproof?</h3><p>It depends on the safe; however, most under-bed gun safes fail to provide adequate protection against fire, heat, and water damage.</p><h3>How long do I need to train my biometric fingerprint?</h3><p>It depends on the fingerprint reader in question. That said, we usually recommend avoiding electronic locking mechanisms in safes that might require quick access in the middle of the night.</p>"
folding treadmills,"<h2>FAQs on folding treadmills</h2><h3>Are folding treadmills hard to assemble?</h3><p>Folding treadmills vary in their assembly instructions. Some arrive almost fully assembled, while some require more in-depth assembly. However, it's pretty common for your treadmill to need just a few screws to come together once it's delivered.</p><h3>Do foldable treadmills have inclines?</h3><p>Yes, most folding treadmills offer inclines. A 10 percent incline is the average, but some can offer more of a steep grade.</p><h3>Are folding treadmills safe and stable?</h3><p>In general, folding treadmills are perfectly safe to use and stable while in use. However, you'll want to make sure you choose one that's suitable for your weight and is made by a reputable brand. That's the best way to determine how secure your treadmill will be.</p><h3>Can you put a folding treadmill on the carpet?</h3><p>You can definitely use a folding treadmill on the carpet - just make sure you put a non-slip treadmill mat underneath its feet first. These mats are designed to offer increased grip and prevent potentially dangerous or damaging movement on soft surfaces.</p><h3>Are folding treadmills worth it?</h3><p>If you're working with limited available space or simply don't want a treadmill to take up permanent space in your home or garage, a folding treadmill is absolutely worth investing in. The versatility, range of possible features, and compact storage method make these foldable machines easy to fit anywhere.</p>"
hunting knives,"<h2>FAQs on hunting knives</h2><h3>What should I expect to pay for a good hunting knife?</h3><p>""Good"" is a subjective term, but we recommend starting your search around the $100 mark. That's where you'll start to see better types of steel and manufacturing practices. The sky's the limit, but our picks fall between $100 and $300.</p><h3>What makes a good hunting knife?</h3><p>A good hunting knife is one that can get the job done and make your life easier. That might mean a precise blade that can delicately dress a dove in the field or a bushcraft knife that can just as easily break down an elk as split firewood. Buy what works for you, not someone else.</p><h3>How long should a hunting knife's blade be?</h3><p>A lot of knife reviewers seem to adhere to the Crocodile Dundee school of thought when it comes to hunting knives. There are times when making careful cuts with something small is more appropriate. We chose blades ranging from less than three inches up to five inches for this guide.</p><h3>Can I use a folding knife for hunting?</h3><p>You sure can. Some of our favorite folding knives are made for hunting. Assuming size isn't an issue, the main drawback is the amount of cleaning that's required afterward. We'd rather not disassemble a folding knife to get it clean if we don't have to.</p>"
compasses,"<h2>FAQs on compasses</h2><p>Historians believe the magnetic navigational compass was invented by the Chinese, possibly as early as the 11th or 12th century. Pre-navigational compasses were invented during the Han Dynasty sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE.</p><p>Two good squad leaders: a jaded corporal, and a platoon sergeant.</p><p>The very best accessory you can have for your compass is a map. Without a map, your compass isn't useless, per se, but you're extremely limited in your ability to navigate beyond a panic azimuth. Other good accessories are a case of some sort to keep it from getting damaged or beat up. and maybe a length of paracord for a tie-down.</p><p>The military typically uses lensatic compasses, which are more durable and rugged than most. Since 1992, the contract for all military compasses has been with Cammenga, whose lensatic compass we named as our pick for Most Durable.</p><p>The most important thing is to assess your needs. Are you teaching your child orienteering as a family weekend activity, or are you solo trekking across the Pacific Northwest? After that, factor in your budget and your skill level - both your current level and the level you wish to achieve. Make sure your compass has a few basics, such as good luminous markings, a solidly fluid encased magnetic needle, and readable markings.</p>"
rangefinders for hunting,"<h2>FAQs about rangefinders for hunting</h2><h3>What is the easiest rangefinder to use?</h3><p>The AOFAR HX-700N is probably the easiest rangefinder to use, simply because it has the fewest fancy features. That being said, many rangefinder manufacturers have put a lot of time and effort into simplifying their user interface to lower the chances of complications in the field.</p><h3>Do you need a slope on a rangefinder?</h3><p>It depends on your terrain. If you plan to hunt from an elevated position or you're roving through mountainous terrain, you'll probably want to have a rangefinder that accounts for slope and calculates your distance using Angle Compensation.</p><h3>How long do laser rangefinders last?</h3><p>Like anything, the better you care for it, the longer it will last. That said, when I asked Google this same question, the most common answer was about five years, but this probably has a lot to do with the frequency of use as well.</p><h3>How do you bow hunt without a rangefinder?</h3><p>Some bowhunters, especially treestand hunters, circumvent the need for rangefinders by pre-marking range distances within their field of fire. This can be done by measuring the distance from the base of your tree to prominent features (like trees, rocks, fences, etc.) in the surrounding area. Having these known distances to key features can help a bowhunter estimate their target's distance by means of comparison.</p>"
cross draw holsters,"<h2>FAQs about cross-draw holsters</h2><h3>What are the advantages of a cross-draw holster?</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages to a cross-draw holster is the ease of access to your firearm while seated. OWB variants of this holster have the added advantage of handling larger or long-barreled handguns much better than most other concealed carry holsters, provided you wear a cover garment with it.</p><h3>Is cross-draw slower?</h3><p>It depends. When sitting, a cross draw may just be the fastest option available, but while standing or walking, there might be a couple of faster options, depending on cover garments and muscle memory. No matter what, practice is key.</p><h3>What side do you wear a cross-draw holster?</h3><p>Cross-draw holsters are designed to be worn on your weak or support side. This means that righties will position their holster on their left hip, while lefties will do the opposite.</p><h3>What is the most comfortable way to conceal carry?</h3><p>This depends heavily on your physique and lifestyle. People who sit most of the time might prefer an ankle holster, cross-draw, or shoulder holster, while those who stand or walk a lot might prefer an IWB option instead.</p><h3>What is your strong-side hip?</h3><p>Your strong-side hip is the hip closest to your dominant hand. If you are right-handed, your right hip will be your strong side. If you're a southpaw, it'll be your left hip.</p>"
survival food kits,"<h2>FAQs about survival food kits</h2><h3>What food should I stockpile for survival?</h3><p>It's safest to always brace for the worst and stock everything you need to meet your nutritional requirements. Focus on essentials to provide carbs, vitamins, and proteins, and look at high-variety packs which include rice, meats, vegetables, and fruits. They'll likely be freeze-dried for a long shelf life.</p><h3>How do you store survival food?</h3><p>Some companies advertise that their freeze-dried foods can be taken anywhere including in cars, offices, and campers for whenever you might need them. A good rule of thumb to follow for any type is to simply keep them somewhere dry and cool - at or below 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h3>What foods have the longest shelf life?</h3><p>Anything freeze-dried will greatly exceed other methods of preservation by leaps and bounds. Most survival food kits sold in bulk will be freeze-dried and capable of lasting for as long as three decades. Compare that to MREs with shelf lives of approximately several years depending on conditions.</p><h3>Are survival food kits worth it?</h3><p>About $100 to over $200 dollars buys you food for a variety of occasions from emergency prep to outdoor adventures that tastes just as fresh in a few years as it did when new. So, yes. I'd say food supplies are money well-spent. You'll never know when you might need them.</p>"
cycling gloves,"<h2>FAQs on cycling gloves</h2><h3>Are gloves necessary for road cycling?</h3><p>No, but if you don't have them, you'll soon wish you did, as sweat and vibration will make longer rides far less pleasant.</p><h3>Do you need cycling gloves in the summer?</h3><p>Yes, not just because of the reasons stated above, but also to protect your hands in the event of a wreck or fall.</p><h3>What should I look for in cycling gloves?</h3><p>Comfortable fit, with little bunching in the palm. I recommend modestly padded ones unless you're mountain bike riding. In that case, extra padding is great.</p><h3>Should cycling gloves feel tight or loose?</h3><p>Snug is the right fit. You want gloves that conform to your hand without constricting it, to allow unimpeded use of your gears and brakes.</p><h3>Why does my hand go numb when cycling?</h3><p>Pressure on the median and ulnar nerves. This is often brought on by vibration (which can be offset with good gloves), a poor bike fit, or inappropriate posture. Check out the linked article for tips on reducing numbness.</p><h3>Do I need half-finger or full-finger gloves?</h3><p>It's weather-dependent. Full-finger gloves are great for colder weather, and some prefer them for mountain bike riding (although I like fingerless unless it's cold out).</p><h3>Do I need a nose wipe?</h3><p>Yes, if you have outdoor allergies. I never use them, but I know folks who swear by them.</p>"
dumbbell sets,"<h2>FAQs on dumbbell sets</h2><h3>Why are they called ""dumbbells?""</h3><p>One theory suggests that the English poet Joseph Addison unintentionally created the name when referring to the church bells he used to work out. Since he'd removed the clappers to silence them, he referred to them as ""dumb"" bells. This seems to be the most probable origin, but we may never know the real reason.</p><h3>What range of weights do people normally use with dumbbells?</h3><p>This is going to be highly subjective depending on spatial needs and fitness goals. That being said, most lifters can effectively utilize dumbbells from 10 to 40 pounds for their goals.</p><h3>Should I buy adjustable dumbbells or fixed dumbbells?</h3><p>Once again, this is highly subjective. If you're tight on space, you might benefit from adjustable dumbbells. But if space is no concern and you want the widest range possible, fixed dumbbells are the way to go because you don't have to mess with dials or plates.</p><h3>Is unilateral training easier with dumbbells?</h3><p>Yes. Dumbbells allow you to focus on specific muscle groups and sections of the body. This is really beneficial if there is a large symmetrical discrepancy in performance between sides. If you can curl 50 pounds with your left arm but only 25 pounds with the right, you can tailor your workouts to improve onside and decrease the discrepancy.</p>"
free standing punching bags,"<h2>FAQs on free-standing punching bags</h2><h3>How heavy should a free-standing punching bag be?</h3><p>Free-standing punching bags will have a base weight somewhere between 200 and 400 pounds. Stronger individuals who practice high-power strikes, especially kicks, will want more ballast in their bag's base. On the flip side, a smaller, lighter individual focusing on speed and lighter-power strikes can get away with something lighter.</p><h3>Why should I buy a free-standing punching bag over a hanging bag?</h3><p>If you need a punching bag that can be easily moved from place to place and/or can accommodate a wide variety of strike types, then go with the free-standing punching bag.</p><h3>Should I fill my free-standing punching bag with water or sand?</h3><p>As a general rule, use water if you expect to fill and empty your punching bag's base on any sort of frequent basis. If you plan to keep your punching bag in a relatively permanent location or if you regularly deliver high-power strikes, then go with sand, a denser option.</p><h3>How do I stop my free-standing punching bag from moving?</h3><p>Free-standing punching bags usually move for one of three reasons: a slick floor, not enough ballast, or the wrong kind of ballast (water instead of sand or pea gravel). To stop your bag from moving, create some friction between the base and floor or adjust the ballast.</p>"
gun safes under 1000,"<h2>FAQs about gun safes under $1,000</h2><h3>Would it be better to purchase a portable or large gun safe?</h3><p>If you have two or more long guns, then you're going to want a large gun safe. A portable safe is best for a combination of pistols, ammunition, and/or valuable documents. As always, it depends on your collection of guns.</p><h3>What is the delivery method for a gun safe?</h3><p>Whether you buy it online or in person, you'll almost never get your safe the same day. Typically, the vendor will schedule a delivery using a truck with a lift gate. Often, the sale includes verbiage about how far and where they will install the safe in your home. A garage or other space on the ground level with no slope is often included in the price, while extra fees will be charged for difficult-to-access locations (like a basement). Once in place, they'll usually bolt the safe into the ground using concrete anchor screws through prefabricated slots in the bottom of the safe cabinet.</p><h3>Is a dehumidifier necessary?</h3><p>Yes, if you want to avoid rust and corrosion. Older, antique guns are particularly vulnerable to this. However, dehumidification doesn't have to be expensive. It can be as simple as buying a $15 refillable desiccant dehumidifier and putting it on the shelf in your safe.</p>"
treadmills under 1000,"<h2>FAQs on treadmills under $1,000</h2><h3>How do I lose weight on a treadmill?</h3><p>High-intensity interval training, or HIIT, seems to be the optimal way to lose weight during treadmill training. In a nutshell, it's periods of high-intensity exertion separated by moderate-intensity ""recovery periods"" and repeated to the point of exhaustion. This is accomplished on treadmills through speed changes and incline changes throughout the workout.</p><h3>How do I move a treadmill?</h3><p>Some of the treadmills on our list are light enough to pick up and carry once folded. For those that don't fold, many come with base-mounted wheels, so it's just a matter of tipping up the machine and wheeling it around your workout space.</p><h3>How do I run on a treadmill?</h3><p>The same way you'd do it on the ground: [lace one foot in front of the other, but faster than if you were walking.</p><h3>Why were treadmills invented?</h3><p>Treadmills were invented 200 years ago in England and were originally used as ""rehabilitation devices"" in prisons, meaning they were made to make people suffer for their bad behavior. In a way, that's what we still use them for today. The more you know!</p><h3>How fast do treadmills go?</h3><p>Most of the higher-end models of treadmills have a max speed of 12 mph, but a handful of models can get up to 15 mph.</p>"
personal locator beacons,"<h2>FAQs about personal locator beacons</h2><h3>How much does a personal locator beacon cost?</h3><p>Prices vary depending on unit capability. The very best unit I reviewed costs almost $400 for the PLB alone, and the cheapest costs about $250. Most require service contracts or subscription fees (costs vary widely) for both emergency and non-emergency communication, so you should definitely factor that into the cost of ownership and use.</p><h3>How does a personal locator beacon work?</h3><p>When you press the SOS button, your PLB sends a powerful distress signal to a network of satellites around the globe. These distress signals are monitored by both government and private rescue coordination centers. The distress call is relayed to an appropriate response agency with data on your location. They, in turn, coordinate with local search and rescue organizations to come get your ass. Note that SAR assets vary from place to place, so you're probably going to get a faster, more capable rescue in the Tetons than you would in less-resourced countries.</p><h3>When should I use my personal locator beacon?</h3><p>Well, think of pressing SOS just like a 911 call. You should use it when you or a member of your team is at immediate risk of loss of life, sight, or limb, and when self-rescue and evacuation isn't the speediest option.</p>"
in wall gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about in-wall gun safes</h2><h3>Is a wall safe secure?</h3><p>Absolutely. Wall safes take the DNA of a standard gun safe and adapt it into a package that becomes one with your house. The typical locking mechanisms from other safes carry over including combination, keypads, and manual keys. Biometric locks are arguably the most secure.</p><h3>How deep is a wall safe?</h3><p>Aside from a small number of ""deep"" wall safes, most wall safes measure between three to six inches deep, just enough to fit in most walls without protruding out or intruding on possible pipes or wiring. Deeper wall safes can stretch to 10 inches.</p><h3>How can I hide my wall safe?</h3><p>Ever watch mystery thrillers or shows with elaborate supervillains holed up in mega-mansions? The right in-wall safe makes the perfect storage solution to hide behind TVs or picture frames. Some rifle safes can be stowed behind easy-to-maneuver bookshelves or curtains. Even try behind clothes hung up in your closet.</p><h3>Can you bolt a safe to the wall?</h3><p>In most cases, yes. Most in-wall safes will be sold with some form of mounting hardware in the form of either screws or bolts. In a few cases, some larger long gun safes may rely on their heft and their placement between the studs to resist movement and prying.</p>"
rowing machines,"<h2>FAQs on rowing machines</h2><h3>How do I use a rowing machine?</h3><p>The most important thing when using a rowing machine is to maintain proper posture and technique to avoid injury. The rowing machine workout is low-impact, but you are using a very high percentage - up to 85 percent - of your muscles. Like lifting weights, there is a time for pushing with your legs and a time for using your upper body.</p><p>As I am not a certified personal trainer, I will defer to those who have the expertise and recommend you seek out the assistance of a personal trainer or use a video instructional guide for step-by-step learning of proper technique.</p><h3>How long should you row on a rowing machine?</h3><p>The answer to this is predicated on your individual fitness goals. Aerobic exercises can go anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes, whereas an anaerobic workout like a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workout could go from 5 to 20 minutes duration.</p><h3>Is a rowing machine safe for pregnancy?</h3><p>Rowing machines are an excellent choice for cardio workouts during pregnancies. Rowing machine workouts are low-impact and do not have the same balance considerations as treadmills and ellipticals. As with any physical activity during pregnancy, you should consult with a medical professional before undergoing a new fitness program.</p>"
field watches,"<h2>FAQs on field watches</h2><h3>Can you wear a field watch with a suit?</h3><p>Absolutely! Watches like the Hamilton Khaki King are almost specifically designed for this use, featuring field watch DNA, but with upgraded styling. Any of these watches on a quality leather strap will look fantastic and can serve as a nice nod to the wearer's outdoorsy tendencies when in more genteel environments.</p><h3>Why is it called a field watch?</h3><p>Field watches come from a long lineage of timepieces worn by military men and women, explorers, and workers, and are therefore usually designed with durability, legibility, and affordability in mind.</p><h3>Should field watches be small?</h3><p>Field watches are generally smaller, generally for the stated reason that they need to be wearable for many different body types, and need to not snag on anything while in use, given their heritage as general-issue military watches. However, larger options like the Orient Star Outdoor are fine and are just as much a field watch as a 36mm Vaer or 38mm Hamilton.</p><h3>What watch do the Navy SEALs wear?</h3><p>Whatever they want. Historically, the frogmen in Vietnam would often be seen with watches from Hamilton, Glycine, and Seiko. However, they generally preferred dive watches like the Seiko 6105, Seiko 62MAS, and the famous Rolex Submariner, owing to their amphibious mission.<br/>"
mens running shoes,"<h2>FAQs about men's running shoes</h2><h3>Should men's running shoes be a size bigger?</h3><p>The size of a running shoe varies depending on the brand. Some brands fit bigger than others while some fit true-to-size. If a shoe is too small, your feet will press against the shoe and you could lose a toenail. If a shoe is too big, your feet will slide and could blister. Therefore, before you buy, it's important to measure your feet and understand the fit of the shoe.</p><h3>What shoes do marathon runners wear?</h3><p>At the highest level, marathon runners wear whatever the best shoes their sponsors are able to provide. Everyone else has to balance performance with cost to find what works for them. It's a matter of personal preference.</p><h3>How do you tell if a shoe is for running?</h3><p>Pay attention to the language manufacturers use. Stay away from athletic shoes, jogging shoes, and cross-trainers. Stick to dedicated running shoes.</p><h3>How long should a pair of running shoes for men last?</h3><p>There are too many variables to give a one-size-fits-all answer, but 500 miles is a safe estimate. Pay attention to the midsole. When you see it starting to pack down, you'll know it can't provide as much cushioning as it used to and that it's time to move on.</p>"
paracords,"<h2>FAQs about paracords</h2><h3>How can you tell if a paracord is real?</h3><p>Since ""real"" paracord is anything that does what you need it to do, your first step is determining why you need it in the first place. Before you get wrapped around the axle about a paracord that can do everything under the sun, decide if you even need to care.</p><h3>What's the difference between 550 and 750 paracord?</h3><p>The most common kind of paracord is 550 cord, which typically has seven internal strands, a four-millimeter diameter, and a static load rating of 550 pounds. The larger 750 cord typically has 11 internal strands, a five-millimeter diameter, and a static load rating of 750 pounds.</p><h3>Can a paracord hold a person?</h3><p>Labels like ""550"" denote how many pounds of stress a given cord can endure before breaking. Remember that you apply much more force than your bodyweight if you're moving. Even if the cord itself can handle a certain load, that doesn't mean the knot and anchor at each end are up to the task.</p><h3>Does braiding paracord make it stronger?</h3><p>Yes, multiple pieces of paracord that provide mutual support will be stronger than a single strand. Be reasonable, though; even the mighty paracord has its limits and structural engineers study advanced math for a reason.</p>"
hunting gps,"<h2>FAQs about hunting GPS</h2><h3>Who makes the most accurate GPS?</h3><p>Garmin. Go through any list of top GPSes, and what you'll find is just a long list of Garmin devices.</p><h3>What is the difference between GPS and DGPS?</h3><p>The main difference between GPS and DGPS (Differential GPS) is the way in which a location is calculated. With a regular GPS, a signal is returned to the device via several satellites. With a DGPS system, the satellite information is sent through a secondary, fixed receiver that then transmits the data back to the main receiver, preventing signal degradation that can cause inaccuracies.</p><h3>What is the easiest GPS to use for hunting?</h3><p>Ease of use is often relative to the user, but generally, the devices that are easiest to use offer the fewest features. The more functions a device has, the more there is to learn to effectively use them. From a personal standpoint, if I were going to be spending a good chunk of money on a hunting GPS, I'd focus on its accuracy and durability before I worried about its ease of use.</p><h3>Is DGPS more accurate than GPS?</h3><p>Yes. While standard GPS is usually accurate to within 10 meters, the DGPS systems are accurate to around one meter or less (sometimes down to 10 centimeters).</p>"
machetes,"<h2>FAQs about machetes</h2><h3>Are machetes legal?</h3><p>In general, if you're camping or using it for normal tasks around the farm or backyard, yes. However, there are so many different state, city, county, and municipality laws out there that it's impossible for us to cover them all in the scope of this article. It's always best to double-check your local laws and restrictions. KnifeUp.com is a fantastic source for up-to-date information.</p><h3>How much does a machete usually cost?</h3><p>Most budget machetes are going to be extremely affordable, sitting at around $30 to $50. Mid-tier machetes are typically a little better quality, costing between $50 and $150, while high-end machetes simply go up from there. For practical uses, we'd stick with machetes in either the budget or mid-tier ranges.</p><h3>Why do machetes frequently come with poor factory edges?</h3><p>A mix of budget-minded blades and poor quality control. Many manufacturers expect that you'll be either beating the heck out of it or that you'll be capable of honing the edge if desired. And, to an extent, they're not wrong. You're likely not going to need a 20,000 grit, 17-degree edge on a machete; it wouldn't hold up to any serious use - unless, of course, you fancy yourself to be Rambo in need of a shave.</p>"

running socks,"<h2>FAQs on running socks</h2><h3>How should running socks fit?</h3><p>Personal preference normally dictates how clothing should fit. With running socks, however, science plays an important role. Ideally, you want close-fitting, tight socks that hug your feet like they're afraid to fall off. This prevents chafing and blistering.</p><h3>Is it OK to go running without socks?</h3><p>Sure! You can go running without socks if you want to. Make sure to have a first aid kit with blister supplies ready for the end of your run. In most cases, socks are needed to protect your feet from the abuse of running in shoes.</p><h3>What is the difference between running socks and regular socks?</h3><p>Regular socks are basic and have no special features for running. They're not made to fit snuggly and are often just decorative. The materials used will vary and are not run-friendly.</p><h3>Why wear compression socks for running?</h3><p>Aside from the medicinal benefits of compression socks, every runner could benefit from increased circulation and support. Compression socks act as a forcefield, keeping your muscles firm and encouraging good blood flow.</p><h3>How much do running socks cost?</h3><p>The median price point seems to be around $20. This could get you 6 pairs of low quality cotton socks, or one pair of high end running socksâ€¦ choose wisely.</p>"
range bags,"<h2>FAQs on range bags</h2><h3>What do you put in your range bag?</h3><p>Everyone has their preferred loadout, but most would probably agree on ammunition, magazines, ear and eye protection, and a stapler if you use paper targets. I like to have a multitool handy as well as a healthy cleaning kit. Extra optics for spotting are nice to have, too.</p><h3>How do you clean range bags?</h3><p>Start by keeping as much dirt and grime out of the bag as possible. Every bag will have its own cleaning instructions, but gentle soap and water usually do the trick. For stubborn dirt, enlist the help of a stiff-bristled brush.</p><h3>Is a backpack or duffel bag-style bag a better choice?</h3><p>A range bag can come in the form of a backpack or a duffel bag, but not all backpacks and duffels make good range bags. Read our ""types of range bags"" section to get a better breakdown of the advantages of each style.</p><h3>Can I carry guns in my range bag?</h3><p>Many range bags are intended to carry firearms. Some include soft cases for pistols, and that's a nice perk as long as they fit what you own. This gear guide includes one range bag that can accommodate rifles and shotguns up to 50 inches long.</p>"
1911 holsters,"<h2>FAQs about 1911 holsters</h2><h3>How safe is a 1911 cocked and locked?</h3><p>Without sounding too flippant, a gun is only as safe as its user. However, if you do choose to carry with a round in the chamber, riding the hammer forward so it needs to be reset before a trigger pull can give you the speed you want in a self-defense situation while lowering the risk of an accidental discharge.</p><h3>What size holster do you need for a 1911?</h3><p>Whatever best fits your model of firearm. Regardless of what you choose, make sure it's comfortable and can hold your weapon safely with the hammer in either position.</p><h3>Can a 1911 fire with the hammer down?</h3><p>No, it cannot. That's why loading a round in the chamber for EDC, then riding the hammer forward, is a great added precaution if you feel the need to keep your weapon loaded in certain situations.</p><h3>Can a 1911 go off by itself?</h3><p>No, however older frames with a lot of wear and tear could drop the hammer if the weapon falls to the ground hard enough and the catch mechanism is released. If you have a poorly maintained weapon, first, shame on you, and second, you may want to reconsider carrying a round in the chamber.</p>"
ab rollers,"<h2>FAQs about ab rollers</h2><h3>Are ab rollers effective?</h3><p>Absolutely. As you go through the movements, you're holding your position to work your core isometrically, almost akin to a plank. This method activates more muscle fibers as you're utilizing most of, if not your entire core, to stabilize yourself.</p><h3>Is an ab roller bad for the back?</h3><p>They're quite the opposite. As you're striving to maintain your flat or mostly-flat position throughout your movements, you're not compressing your spinal discs and avoid risking a herniated disc. When done right, even a slight tuck as you roll in won't be enough to over flex your spine.</p><h3>Can an ab roller get me a six-pack?</h3><p>The best answer is maybe. Of course, like any solid routine, you can shave fat and build a brick wall of a gut, but that's also heavily influenced by intensity, frequency, and diet. Don't think of ab rollers as your endgame weapon but as an extra nifty tool at your disposal.</p><h3>Are ab rollers better than sit-ups?</h3><p>Ab rollers deliver an effective workout as you're utilizing your core to maintain position throughout the movements without stressing your lower spine. A study has shown that, while you're merely stabilizing yourself, ab rollers activate more muscle fibers than basic sit-ups, as well.</p>"
solar generators,"<h2>FAQs on solar generators</h2><h3>Are solar generators safe?</h3><p>Yes, solar generators are generally very safe. In fact, The Hartford lists falling from the roof during installation as one of the biggest risks of using solar power. As with any electrical system, make sure you understand how everything works and double-check any work you do yourself.</p><h3>What size solar generator should I get?</h3><p>Off-Grid Home has a good walkthrough for solar generator sizing, but the gist is that it depends on how much power you want. Use a watt meter to see exactly how much power a given appliance or device is currently using, then add up the consumption of everything you want to power.</p><h3>How many years will a solar generator last?</h3><p>You can expect the best solar generators to last more than 25 years. Proper care is important to getting the most out of this technology, so read the manufacturer's instructions for use and storage.</p><h3>Can I run my house on solar power only?</h3><p>Many people power their entire house with solar energy and have electricity leftover that may be sold back to the power company. As technology advances, the time it takes for a solar power investment to pay itself off is getting shorter and shorter.</p>"
ghillie suits,"<h2>FAQs about ghillie suits</h2><h3>How effective are ghillie suits for hunting?</h3><p>They are certainly an effective tool for the ground hunter, from the turkey to the deer woods. Matt Zirnsak from The Push Archery had a close call with multiple black bears on a hunt. Luckily, black bears are generally shy creatures. For the mobile hunter, the ghillie gives you great concealment, but you still have to be mindful of the wind and thermals.</p><h3>Are ghillie suits legal?</h3><p>Yes, there's nothing illegal about them. I know an insurance fraud investigator who used one to capture footage of a claimant in violation of his worker's compensation claim. However, the main conflict is the hunting field where you may be required by local or state law to wear orange.</p><h3>What ghillie suit does the military use?</h3><p>Generally, the individual sniper makes his/her own ghillie, but some units may issue ghillie kits to those in sniper or reconnaissance units.</p><h3>Do snipers wear ghillie suits?</h3><p>Yes, but it's very mission-specific. Not all situations will require them, and it's a piece of kit that most won't carry unless it's necessary due to its bulk. That said, they do make great blankets in the field on those cold nights/mornings along the Euphrates River.</p>"
flashlights,"<h2>FAQs on flashlights</h2><h3>What is the brightest flashlight?</h3><p>According to our research, the Imalent MS18 is the brightest flashlight currently available. Does anyone really need 100,000 lumens? Probably not, but that doesn't make us want one any less. There are worse ways to spend $670, and the bragging rights alone are worth that much.</p><h3>What is the most reliable flashlight?</h3><p>There are a lot of companies that make reliable flashlights, but some of the features we look for are waterproof housings, protected lenses, and rechargeable batteries. Those features tend to be indicators of a well-built flashlight that can take a few knocks.</p><h3>What is the longest-lasting flashlight?</h3><p>Battery life is affected by so many things that it's hard to definitively say that one flashlight lasts the longest. What we can say is that a rechargeable flashlight and a solar power bank belong in everyone's survival kit or go-bag.</p><h3>How many lumens should a good flashlight have?</h3><p>If you're working in confined spaces and want to preserve some semblance of night vision, you might want a flashlight that can achieve double-digit lumen output. On the other hand, if you need to see across large, open areas, having 750 to 1,000 lumens to work with is a good idea.<br/>"
camping tents,"<h2>FAQs on camping tents</h2><h3>What size tent do I need?</h3><p>Tents are rated for a certain number of occupants. Those ratings often indicate how many can fit inside rather than how many would want to fit inside. We sometimes recommend sizing up if you have more than one person.</p><h3>Are tents good for all seasons?</h3><p>Any tent is better than no tent, but they aren't designed for every climate. The best three-season tents work in most temperature ranges, but hardcore winter camping will require something specifically designed for extreme cold. An insulated tent liner like the Crua Outdoors Culla Maxx is another option.</p><h3>What is the best camping tent style?</h3><p>It's hard to say that any given tent style is the best, but we're pretty partial to a good backpacking tent. They're versatile, light, and strong. That being said, they may not be the best for you. That's why we included other options like A-frames, cabin tents, and rooftop tents.</p><h3>How much space does a tent need in my pack?</h3><p>Tents pack down to a pretty compact size, but that will vary from tent to tent. If you're sharing your tent, it's a good idea to share the job of carrying all its pieces.<br/>"
go bags,"<h2>FAQs on go bags</h2><h3>How much does a good go bag cost?</h3><p>We found small, well-built backpacks for as little as $150. Larger packs that can sustain you indefinitely cost closer to $500 by the time you add the necessary frame and suspension system.</p><h3>Do I need a go bag?</h3><p>In most cases, staying put is better than taking your chances on the road. Don't be too quick to assume that the grass is greener somewhere else. There are times, though, when circumstances dictate that you evacuate. When that happens, a go bag is very necessary.</p><h3>What makes a good go bag?</h3><p>A good go bag holds everything you need and lasts as long as you need it to. That's situation-dependent, so buy what works for you not someone else. In general, durability and ease of customization are big advantages.</p><h3>How big should a go bag be?</h3><p>Go bag sizing is directly related to time. If you just need to get home from across town, a small backpack is great. Assault packs are best for stints of three days or less. Beyond that, look for a hiking or hunting pack to travel on foot, or a large duffel to travel by vehicle.</p>"
shoulder holsters,"<h2>FAQs on shoulder holsters</h2><h3>If shoulder holsters are so great, why are they so uncommon?</h3><p>Shoulder holsters are an acquired taste. In most cases, they wouldn’t be the first option we recommend. Other styles of carry are just more efficient. There are circumstances, though, when a shoulder holster makes a lot of sense. If you’ve found yourself in one of those, we have you covered. </p><h3>Are shoulder holsters good for concealed carry?</h3><p>Yes and no. Ultimately, you need to find what works for you. There are definitely times when shoulder holsters thrive, and others when they struggle. It all depends on what and where you’re carrying. </p><h3>Is there a shoulder holster that fits my [insert the very common pistol that you think is a special flower here]?</h3><p>Probably. Holster manufacturers profit from catering to a wide consumer base, and materials like Kydex make adapting to different pistols more cost-effective than ever. If all else fails, universal options are out there.</p>"
lpvo scopes,"<h2>FAQs about LPVOs</h2><h3>What is an LPV scope?</h3><p>LPV is just another catch-all term for LPVOs. They just dropped the optics and replaced it with scope. </p><h3>What LPVOs does the U.S. military use?</h3><p>SOCOM uses the Nightforce ATACR 1-8X, the Army uses the SIG Sauer TANGO6, and the Marine Corps uses the Trijicon VCOG. </p><h3>What magnification is considered LPVO?</h3><p>Typically, 1.0X to 1.5X is where LPVOs begin, and they can go anywhere from there with 10X and even 12X models existing. </p><h3>What’s the difference between LPVO and ACOG?</h3><p>An ACOG is a fixed-power prism sight. LPVOs are variable sights. </p><h3>Which is better, an FFP scope or an SFP scope?</h3><p>It’s entirely dependent on the task at hand. The 1-4X optics are typically good in the SFP plane, and anything above often works better as an FFP. </p>"
tactical belts,"<h2>FAQs on tactical belts</h2><h3>Does a tactical belt go through belt loops?</h3><p>Some do, as with most of the tactical gun belts on this list, but there are belts like the PHLster Enigma that go inside your clothes, and gun belts, which go over an inner belt and use Velcro to stay attached.</p><h3>Why are tactical belts so expensive?</h3><p>Things like durability and rigidity are paramount with tactical belts, so greater care has to be taken to make them stand up to heavy use, rather than just look the part. Things like stiffening layers, durable leather or nylon, and dense stitching cost money.</p><h3>Can you put a holster on a tactical belt?</h3><p>Yes, that’s the purpose.</p><h3>What tactical belts do the military use?</h3><p>Belts specifically designed for concealed carry aren’t a common tool in the military, and many service members use battle belts instead. However, certain individuals like those assigned to various three-letter agencies who work in plain clothes have spoken highly of belts from brands like 5.11, Hanks, and Galco.</p>"
chest rigs,"<h2>FAQs on chest rigs</h2><h3>Is a chest rig better than a plate carrier? </h3><p>When it comes to protecting your vital organs, plate carriers win. The good news is that you can have both or even combine the two and use them to adapt to your missions. </p><h3>Can you wear a plate carrier under a chest rig?</h3><p>Absolutely, depending on the carrier. Streamlined plate carries may be more challenging, but we used to wear chest rigs over our MTVs and larger body armor vests. </p><h3>Where should your chest rig sit?</h3><p>The placard should sit around the base of your sternum/rib cage, but you don’t want it too high where it affects your reloading ability. The waist strap will normally sit around the lower back while the X or H should sit in between your shoulder blades. Play with the placement to get it right to make sure it doesn’t interfere with wearing belts or packs. </p><h3>What should be on your chest rig?</h3><p>This is all mission-dependent. Most chest rigs can carry one to three mags for each firearm you’re carrying, any light devices, notepads or other admin essentials, navigation devices, and/or medical supplies. <br/>"
survival knives,"<h2>FAQs about survival knives</h2><h3>What is the best survival knife?</h3><p>Our pick for the best overall survival knife is the Gerber LMF II, which is not to say that it’s the absolute best at anything, just that it’s a knife that will work well for most people’s purposes. Personally, I like the TOPS Brakimo, but that’s what works for my intended purposes.</p><h3>Is it legal to carry a survival knife?</h3><p>That depends on your locality. Certain states prohibit the concealed carry of fixed blade knives, or knives over certain lengths. In general, these are knives intended for use in the wilderness, and most places in the world have exceptions in their knife laws for “good reason,” which is usually satisfied by being on a hiking or camping trip. As always, know your local laws.</p><h3>What are the holes on a survival knife for?</h3><p>Holes on a survival knife can serve many purposes, ranging from being lightening cuts, as with the Argali Carbon, to lashing holes on the Gerber LMF II that allow you to make an improvised spear, to lanyard loops to allow one to retain the knife easier in highly mobile situations like rock climbing or on a boat. Other uses can be for using a hand drill to make fire, straightening arrowheads, or opening gas keys on an oxygen tank.</p><h3>How thick should a survival knife be?</h3><p>Generally speaking, knives that are 4mm in thickness or greater at the spine are going to be able to stand up to the kind of high-impact use that’s required to strip branches, baton logs, and chop wood. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and the thickness can also be dependent on factors such as blade length, intended use, and blade steel. Making the blade too thick can add unnecessary weight or make the knife minimally useful for cleaning animals or cutting vegetables.</p><h3>What is jimping?</h3><p>Jimping is the name for serrations on the spine of the knife, which allow you to get greater control of the knife when performing delicate tasks such as whittling or cleaning an animal. They allow you to get a grip on the spine of the blade with your thumb.</p><h3>What is the best type of steel for a knife’s blade?</h3><p>This depends on your intended usage, your sharpening capabilities, and your budget. I personally prefer CPM S35VN, as it holds an edge for a very long time and keeps rust off very well. However, it’s difficult to resharpen and requires that I send it off to a professional for resharpening. Many survival knife companies seem to prefer 1095, 420HC, and D2, as they’re easy enough to resharpen and offer good edge retention, at the expense of corrosion resistance. Buyers looking for knives to use around water, especially saltwater, should look for knives specifically designed to hold up against heavy corrosion.</p><h3>How can I sharpen my knife?</h3><p>We did a great article on this, but in general you should invest in a good-quality guided sharpener for home usage, and a good-quality portable sharpening stone for use in the field, and learn how to use both properly. This will enhance the service life of your knife and save you money in the long run that would be otherwise spent on sending your knife to a professional for sharpening.</p>"
shooting ear protection,"<h2>FAQs on shooting ear protection</h2><h3>Are ear muffs better than earplugs?</h3><p>Generally, un-powered earmuff style hearing protection can offer more sound protection than simple earplugs. However, in terms of powered hearing protection, the opposite is usually true, just due to how they seal the ear from sound and the requirement for the powered hearing protection to have hear-through capability.</p><h3>What is the best ear protection for shooting ranges?</h3><p>Most hearing protection will work for outdoor ranges since the open air and lowered risk of gunshots reverberating make them generally quieter. However, if you shoot primarily indoors, the Safariland Liberator HP offers a very high, officially tested sound protection level that will protect your ears from reverberating gunshots in a confined space.</p><h3>What is the highest dB reduction level for earplugs?</h3><p>Generally, most earplugs have a noise reduction rate that tops out in the low 30s, which is much higher than many powered hearing protection options can offer. However, this can be enhanced by doubling up, or by using powered hearing protection that offers active noise canceling, such as the Liberator HPs, which aren’t earplugs.<br/>"
hatchets for camping,"<h2>FAQs on hatchets</h2><h3>Are hatchets and tomahawks the same thing?</h3><p>Hatchets and tomahawks are very similar, but tomahawks place more of an emphasis on throwing and lightweight design. Hatchets tend to be heavier and more focused on chopping wood than striking a target.</p><h3>How do I choose between a hatchet and an axe?</h3><p>This is a pretty easy choice that comes down to space. If you’re able to keep an axe in your garage or vehicle, it will be much more efficient than a hatchet. If you’re traveling by foot or tight on space, a hatchet provides quite a bit of cutting power in a more portable package.</p><h3>How do I sharpen a hatchet?</h3><p>We’re sure everyone has a preferred method, but sharpening a hatchet is very similar to sharpening a knife. Depending on how beat up the edge is, you might need to use a file before busting out the whetstone.</p>"
tactical pants,"<h2>FAQs on tactical pants</h2><h3>What pants do U.S. special operations forces wear?</h3><p>This is a tough question to answer because there are special operator units in every branch of the military. In general, military special operators will wear their battle dress uniforms, some other issued uniform, or whatever their mission requires.  </p><h3>Are 5.11 pants good?</h3><p>Yes. 5.11 Tactical is one of the most popular tactical apparel makers today. Overall, they make excellent pants and good-quality gear. Of course, you should always research gear items before you buy to make sure they’re adequate for your needs. </p><h3>What are the best combat trousers?</h3><p>The best combat trousers are the ones that fit your body and are equipped with the features and materials best suited for your needs. If you need a specific answer, scroll up to the top of this list. </p>"
spotlights,"<h2>FAQs about spotlights</h2><h3>How many lumens is a good spotlight?</h3><p>This is really subjective to the distance you’re attempting to spot at. I’d strongly recommend no less than 600 lumens for spotlights, as this will give you a decent range for most applications, but the farther you’re shining the higher power you’ll need.</p><h3>Can I use my spotlight as a battery bank?</h3><p>Several of the spotlights on this list can double as a battery bank, however, I strongly encourage getting a separate and dedicated battery bank to prevent draining your spotlight unnecessarily.</p><h3>What’s the difference between a floodlight and a spotlight?</h3><p>A floodlight is designed to illuminate large areas like fields or lakes. Spotlights are used to light up a specific area and have a more focused beam. </p><h3>What’s the difference between lumens and candela power?</h3><p>Simply put, the difference is candela is the source power and lumens is the total available light. You can view an in-depth breakdown here.</p>"
tactical backpacks,"<h2>FAQs on tactical backpacks</h2><h3>What should go in a tactical backpack?</h3><p>This really depends on the mission. Common items are extra ammunition, water, a first aid kit, food, personal hygiene items, a hardshell jacket, a warming layer, a headlamp, communication devices, maps, pens, GPS, and other mission-specific tools. Depending on the length of the mission, you might also consider a lightweight blanket, extra clothing, and shelter. </p><h3>What are the loops for on tactical backpacks?</h3><p>The loops serve two purposes: 1) to attach other small pouches to expand the carrying capacity of the pack, and 2) to provide a place to attach immediately accessible items.</p><h3>What are the benefits of a tactical backpack?</h3><p>Tactical backpacks typically have greater durability, modularity, and organizational options than civilian backpacks.</p><h3>How heavy is a tactical backpack?</h3><p>It depends. The larger the capacity of the pack and the more durable the material in terms of denier, the heavier it typically is. </p><h3>What is the difference between a regular backpack and a tactical backpack?</h3><p>Civilian backpacks tend to be considerably lighter but less durable. </p><h3>How do you use a tactical backpack?</h3><p>Like all backpacks, you put it on your back and walk around. So easy a Marine can do it!</p>"
4 person tents,"<h2>FAQs on 4-person tents</h2><h3>What brand of 4-person tent is best?</h3><p>REI Co-op has the most highly rated options, though many other brands have four-person tents that set themselves apart.</p><h3>How do you pick the right size tent?</h3><p>Consider what kind of camping you’ll be doing — whether this be an annual family camping trip, frequent car camping one-nighters, or weeklong backpacking excursions. Do you need a tent to fit a family of four, or would a two-person tent for just you and your partner suffice?</p><h3>Is a four-person tent big enough? </h3><p>Four-person tents are technically big enough to fit four people (and sometimes a dog), but that doesn’t mean they are always the most comfortable. If you are looking to spread out even more, consider upgrading to a six-person tent.</p>"
long range walkie talkies,"<h2>FAQs about long-range walkie talkies</h2><h3>What is Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service?</h3><p>Family Radio Service, or FRS, and General Mobile Radio Service are sets of frequencies that are open to everyone to use, regardless of what licenses or certifications they might have. Outside of these frequencies, you’ll need a HAM license, and advanced certifications may be required to use certain frequencies, wattages, or encryption protocols.</p><h3>How much distance can walkie talkies cover?</h3><p>This is determined by the waveform, output power, and terrain, but GMRS frequencies with a stock antenna usually have a line-of-sight transmission distance of five miles. Using better antennas or different frequencies available to HAM licensees is important to increasing range.</p><h3>Do walkie talkies run out of battery?</h3><p>Um, yes?</p>"
red dot sights,"<h2>FAQs on red dot sights</h2><h3>What red dot sights do the Navy SEALs use?</h3><p>Aimpoint and Trijicon are the go-to for Navy SEALs — specifically the Aimpoint Micro series and the Trijicon RMR for handguns. </p><h3>What is the clearest red dot sight?</h3><p>The Aimpoint CompM5s provides a crystal clear viewing window tied to a very crisp and awesome little red dot. </p><h3>Do soldiers use red dot sights?</h3><p>The Army currently issues the M68 CCO, aka the Aimpoint CompM4, to most soldiers. Additionally, SOCOM commandos utilize the Trijicon RMR on handguns. </p>"
bedside gun safes,"<h2>FAQs on bedside gun safes</h2><h3>Are gun safes worth it?</h3><p>Yes. Although a lockable case won’t prevent a thief from stealing your gun (by stealing the case), it does act as a deterrent and greatly reduces the chances of an unauthorized user from gaining access to your firearm, while simultaneously giving you quick access. A gun safe, on the other hand, is better suited for preventing theft because of the bulk and weight. </p><h3>Where should I keep my gun in the bedroom?</h3><p>For a bedside gun safe, it makes sense to mount it within easy reach of where you sleep. That said, make sure your safe is secured to the floor, wall, or similar anchor point so a burglar can’t walk away with the unopened safe in hand while you’re out on the town.</p><h3>Do biometric gun safes work?</h3><p>We recommend avoiding biometric gun safes as their electronic components are susceptible to water damage and can be unreliable. Also, many biometric safes come with very loose fingerprint reading tolerances in order to maximize your ability to open the safe. Unfortunately, this results in a higher likelihood of a false positive reading, giving unauthorized individual access to your weapon.<br/>"
mag pouches for plate carriers,"<h2>FAQs on mag pouches for plate carriers</h2><h3>What is a mag pouch?</h3><p>“Mag” is short for magazine and is the nomenclature for the ammunition storage and feeding device for a firearm. A “mag pouch” is a piece of gear designed to hold a magazine. </p><h3>What should you have on your plate carrier?</h3><p>At the bare minimum, I recommend mag pouches and an Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK). Anything in addition to that will depend on your job and the mission.</p><h3>How many mags do you carry on your plate carrier?</h3><p>The typical loadout for infantry is around six rifle magazines. Again, this depends on your job and mission. SWAT or Special Forces may carry more ammo while Motor T carries less. </p><h3>What mag pouches do the military use?</h3><p>The standard-issue mag pouches depend on the branch. Each branch has its preference depending on its mission, but typically the pouches are made by companies like Eagle Industries and are approved by the Berry Amendment. </p><h3>Are mag pouches universal? </h3><p>No. Some are capable of carrying many different types of rifle or pistol magazines. Most are specifically designed for certain styles of magazines, though.</p>"
night vision goggles,"<h2>FAQs about night vision devices</h2><h3>What’s the best inexpensive night vision?</h3><p>We hate to break it to you, but the PVS-14 we recommended is affordable night vision. Cheap night vision might technically allow you to see in certain low-light situations, but it isn’t usable in any kind of training or tactical environment.</p><h3>What is the difference between night vision goggles and night vision binoculars?</h3><p>Binocular night vision goggles mount to a helmet and use one tube for each eye to create lifelike depth perception and field of view. Night vision binoculars are devices that are used by hand rather than mounted to a helmet. The latter are often capable of magnification similar to traditional binoculars.</p><h3>What kind of night vision does the military use?</h3><p>The PVS-14 is widely used by the U.S. military and NATO forces. Jobs that require enhanced night vision capabilities (think pilots, special forces, and the like) use binocular night vision goggles that allow depth perception, a wider field of view, and better image quality. The next generation of night vision technology looks like something out of a science fiction movie.</p>"
drop leg holsters,"<h2>FAQs about drop-leg holsters</h2><h3>What is the purpose of a drop-leg holster?</h3><p>A drop-leg holster shifts the pistol down onto the upper- to mid-thigh so bulky body armor with side plates and/or pouches don’t interfere with drawing your pistol.</p><h3> Can you open-carry with a drop-leg holster?</h3><p>Yes, provided you are legally allowed to open-carry, drop-leg holsters are excellent for the task.</p><h3> Are drop-leg holsters legal in the USA?</h3><p>Yes, provided you are in a jurisdiction that allows you to open-carry or are a suitable exemption (e.g., police officer, at a range, etc).</p><h3> What holsters does the FBI use?</h3><p>Not to be confused with the “FBI cant,” which just refers to a particular holster angle, the FBI mostly uses common law enforcement holsters like Safariland, Bianchi, and Blackhawk brands. The famous Hostage Rescue Team and other tactical components of the FBI generally prefer Safariland holsters.</p>"
hidden gun safes,"<h2>FAQs for hidden gun safes</h2><h3>Are hidden gun safes secure?</h3><p>Yes, just not in the same way as traditional gun safes. Hidden gun safes are easy for anyone to open, but hard to find. There’s a case to be made for each kind of gun safe. </p><h3>Are hidden gun safes fireproof?</h3><p>Most hidden gun safes are not fireproof. If you don’t have a way to protect your firearms from fire, take out an insurance policy or be prepared to replace them out of pocket.</p><h3>Are hidden gun safes legal?</h3><p>There are no states that prohibit hidden gun safes, but some states do require you to lock up your firearms when they’re in storage, according to the Giffords Law Center. Also, some of those states require you to use an approved locking device. This could be a safe and/or a trigger lock. Either way, you should review local and state laws to ensure compliance.</p>"
neck knives,"<h2>FAQs on neck knives</h2><h3>Are neck knives practical?</h3><p>It depends entirely on what you plan to use it for. If you’re carrying it concealed for self-defense, it will be slower to access than a lot of alternatives, not to mention smaller. If you’re using it for everyday carry, it’ll probably come in handy for the odd job. However, the stereotypically smaller handles aren’t typically comfortable for extended use. I typically only carried a neck knife as my backup, to my backup, to my backup, and it only really got used when I lent it to someone unfamiliar with the various locking mechanisms of folding knives.</p><h3>Are neck knives legal?</h3><p>Neck knives are legal in most states, but it depends on your state’s knife laws and local restrictions. Laws that limit your blade length or ban carrying concealed fixed blades can severely limit your options. To check out your state’s knife laws, click here.</p><h3>Are there any alternatives to carrying a neck knife around your neck?</h3><p>Absolutely. I’ve carried a few neck knives on my belt, in my pocket, or shoved in my boot. There are also various shoulder harness setups like the Galco SHUKA that can offer even better concealment.<br/>"
ballistic helmets,"<h2>FAQs on ballistic helmets</h2><h3>Is a ballistic helmet worth it if you’re not military?</h3><p>There are many reasons to own a ballistic helmet if you’re not in the military. For instance, many SWAT officers wear one when serving high-risk warrants, and it’s common for reporters who are reporting in active war zones to wear one. Helmets are also the most secure platform for mounting night vision, as compared to headbands and skull caps, but a bump helmet is just as secure with less cost. Ultimately, it will be up to the end-user to decide if ballistic protection for their head is worthwhile.</p><h3>Are ballistic helmets legal?</h3><p>The short answer to this is that local laws vary. The long answer is that in certain states, you cannot buy body armor in the mail and have to go to an authorized dealer, and in nearly every state is it illegal to own any kind of body armor if you are a convicted felon. Additionally, in some states, wearing body armor while committing a crime of any sort leads to an enhanced sentence. Know your local laws and proceed with caution.</p><h3>What is the difference between bump and ballistic helmets?</h3><p>A bump helmet only provides protection against blunt force trauma, hence the name “bump helmet.” Ballistic helmets are made of specially composed materials designed to deflect or stop bullets and fragmentation. It is very important that you make sure that you are wearing the right helmet for the right job, so if you anticipate ballistic threats, don’t be caught wearing a bump helmet.</p><h3>Is there a Level 4 ballistic helmet?</h3><p>As of the time of writing, there is no helmet that reliably stops a direct hit from M2 armor-piercing rounds at a distance of 10 feet, which is more or less the standard for NIJ IV. Additionally, rounds of this caliber enter into the realm of muzzle energies that would cause traumatic brain injury, whiplash, and concussion simply from the actual force of the round impacting and being stopped by the helmet, making this a very hard thing to achieve.</p><h3>What is a Level 3 ballistic helmet?</h3><p>A true level III ballistic helmet will stop a 7.62 NATO round at 10 feet. To my knowledge, there is only one helmet that achieves this without using additional armor applique, and that is the Highcom Arditi. Additionally, the National Institute of Justice does not officially certify helmets, so it’s mostly on the manufacturer to test that their helmets can do the same thing as the NIJ standard for plates. Reference this link for more information.</p><h3>What is the strongest ballistic helmet?</h3><p>Of the helmets we surveyed, the Ops-Core RF1 and the Highcom Arditi are the current top contenders for raw ballistic protection. Both of them will stop serious rifle threats, and the Ops-Core rated for that hit on every part of the helmet, whether it’s on the edge or on the top of the cranium.</p><h3>What ballistic helmets do SEALs use?</h3><p>The short answer to this question is “whatever the hell they want,” but the long answer is that Navy SEALs have been spotted wearing Ops-Core helmets most frequently, with specific versions like the Ops-Core FAST maritime being specifically designed for their use. Rest assured that whatever the latest and greatest is, generously funded Special Operations units are probably using it in some capacity.</p><h3>Can civilians buy ballistic helmets?</h3><p>It depends on the specific model and where the individual in question lives. Certain retailers and certain manufacturers will not sell certain items without proof of military or law enforcement affiliation. This is mostly done for liability reasons and a desire to clamp down on people trying to sell high-tech helmets to Russia and China to be reverse-engineered.</p><h3>Are ballistic helmets controlled for export?</h3><p>Ballistic helmets, personal protective equipment, and military gear, in general, are governed under the International Trade in Arms Regulation, or ITAR. It is a severe offense to sell, give, or trade these items outside of the borders of the United States without specific licensure from the American government. Violating this regulation can lead to severe penalties such as fines, prison time, and asset confiscation. There is a significant black market for American tactical gear, especially in countries where MilSim Airsoft is popular, such as Europe and Asia. DO NOT buy personal protective equipment to be resold to a foreigner, or risk severe penalties, no matter how many multiples of the MSRP they offer to pay you. When in doubt, ask the manufacturer if the item in question is controlled under this regulation.<br/>"
walkie talkies,"<h2>FAQs about walkie talkies</h2><h3>How much range do I need?</h3><p>The useable range of most walkie talkies is pretty limited––typically less than a mile. It’s possible to get better results, but going much further requires a license. Becoming a licensed radio operator isn’t expensive and it opens the doors to higher quality radios.</p><h3>What features do I need to consider when buying a walkie-talkie?</h3><p>Which walkie talkie you choose depends on what you plan to use it for. Some things to consider are waterproofing, texting, GPS capabilities, and the number of channels your radio comes programmed with. </p><h3>What’s the difference between VHF and UHF radios?</h3><p>Radio frequencies are classified by their wavelength. VHF (very high frequency) radios use wavelengths between 30 and 300 megahertz and are useful in unobstructed outdoor settings. UHF (ultra-high frequency) radios operate between 300 and 3,000 megahertz and provide a higher quality signal. </p><h3>How much do walkie talkies cost?</h3><p>Most FRS radios, like those on this list, cost less than $100. Entry-level sets can be found for less than $40 and premium ones can go for nearly $200. The latest and greatest cost even more than that.</p>"
backpack coolers,"<h2>FAQs on backpack coolers</h2><h3>What should I look for in a backpack cooler?</h3><p>Based on my experience, you should look for something that functions as a cooler first and backpack second. After that, consider comfort and ruck-ability. That means you can trust your cargo is going to get there as cold as possible.    </p><h3>Can you put ice in a cooler bag?</h3><p>Yes, stuff as much ice as you can fit into your backpack cooler. A cooler bag is going to need some sort of cold apparatus to maintain temperature, so ice bricks or ice packs are another great option because you won’t have to worry about leaks. A frozen water bottle works great as well.  </p><h3>How do you keep your cooler cold the longest?</h3><p>Pre-chilling the cooler is a necessary first step. Get your cooler into the cold garage, actually place it in the fridge or freezer, or sacrifice a bag of ice placed inside. Once chilled, line the bottom with ice bricks, then ice and your food or drinks, and finally top off the contents with more ice bricks. Pre-freezing your perishables will prolong the coldness in your cooler, too.</p>"
6 person tents,"<h2>FAQs on 6-person tents</h2><h3>How big are 6-person tents?</h3><p>Six-person tents generally have 80 to 100 square feet of floor area, ranging from eight to 12 feet on either side. They typically have a peak height taller than six feet, allowing most people to comfortably walk around. </p><h3>Who needs a 6-person camping tent?</h3><p>These massive tents are great for families or groups with four to six members. As they are quite heavy, they are largely suited for camping in the backyard and car camping, as well as music festivals.</p><h3>What are the other benefits of a 6-person tent?</h3><p>Six-person tents generally have ample storage space, with pockets on the inside and large vestibules to store larger gear or to cook under when it’s raining. They also often include room dividers for some extra privacy. </p><h3>What are the disadvantages of these tents?</h3><p>These tents are quite heavy, so you won’t want to bring them into the backcountry. It also can be difficult to fit them on a tent pad in a campsite, so you’ll have to ensure you have a large enough space.</p>"
skinning knives,"<h2>FAQs on skinning knives</h2><h3>How sharp should a skinning knife be?</h3><p>As sharp as you can get it. Hides, tendons, and muscles can be tough to cut and your blades will dull over time. The sharper you start, the farther they’ll go.</p><h3>What is the difference between a hunting knife and a skinning knife?</h3><p>Skinning knives are, technically, hunting knives, but are more specialized for the skinning of animals as opposed to the less delicate work of chopping and quartering. A skinning knife tends to be smaller than most hunting knives and often has more curvature to the underside of the blade to allow a longer stroke.</p><h3>Do skinning knives need to be curved?</h3><p>Skinning knives don’t need to be curved, but it does help. An elongated curve allows for a longer stroke of the shorter blade. </p><h3>Can you use any knife for skinning?</h3><p>You can. Hell, you could use a butter knife, but that doesn’t mean it’ll be easy or smart.</p>"
long range scopes,"<h2>FAQs on long-range scopes</h2><h3>How much magnification is needed for long-range shooting?</h3><p>Depending on your caliber and shooting application, a good long-range scope will have a magnification range of around 5-20x. This range should provide plenty of power for almost any long-range shooting application.</p><h3>What is a good long-range scope for a rifle?</h3><p>This somewhat depends on what one means by “long-range.” That said, most long-distance shooters would be wise to find a reliable scope that features a 5-20x magnification range, first focal plane MRAD or grid-style reticle, and fully coated lenses.</p><h3>What is the longest range scope?</h3><p>The number of long-range scopes on today’s market can be pretty overwhelming, but to date, the most powerful scope we have encountered (in terms of max magnification power) is the March Genesis ELR 6-60x.</p>"
bushcraft knives,"<h2>FAQs about bushcraft knives</h2><h3>What are the best bushcraft knife brands?</h3><p>Brands like TOPS, Morakniv, and Esee are known for making fantastic bushcraft knives, and companies like Benchmade produce bushcraft knives made from so-called super-steels which aid in corrosion resistance and edge retention.</p><h3>What size knife is best for bushcraft?</h3><p>In my opinion, the sweet spot for regular use is from three to four inches, but there are larger and smaller knives that do very well for bushcraft purposes. Different people will have different preferences based on their experiences and equipment.</p><h3>What is the difference between a bushcraft knife and a survival knife?</h3><p>A bushcraft knife is specifically designed for working with vegetation in the wild, and prioritizes this above other tasks. A survival knife is designed to accomplish multiple tasks in a survival environment, including bushcraft. Knives like the Benchmade Anonimus, Esee 6, and Wander Lynx all occupy a gray area between the two.</p>"
thermal scopes,"<h2>FAQs on thermal scopes</h2><h3>What thermal scope does the U.S. military use?</h3><p>We’re sure there are other optics in use around the world, but the PAS-13 is what most service members are likely to encounter. This thermal scope was developed by Raytheon and the U.S. Army.</p><h3>How long does a thermal scope last?</h3><p>Thermal scopes do not suffer from the same kind of degradation experienced by analog night vision devices. You’re much more likely to trade up for a newer model than you are to experience a system failure.</p><h3>How far can you shoot with a thermal scope?</h3><p>In this case, range has far more to do with target identification than controlling your point of impact. Can you land rounds several hundred yards out? Sure. Can you tell what you’re destroying? Probably not. Our resident machine-gunner, Travis Pike, remembers a time when he couldn’t identify whether an approaching person was armed until they came within 100 yards.  </p><h3>Can thermal rifle scopes be used in daylight?</h3><p>Absolutely. Thermal imaging devices have been used by the military, law enforcement, and hunters for all kinds of daytime applications. </p>"
iron sights,"<h2>FAQs on iron sights</h2><h3>Are iron sights obsolete?</h3><p>No — fight me in the comments section. There are absolutely better options for the majority of tactical situations, but iron sights fill a role that I don’t see being eclipsed by technology anytime soon.</p><h3>Will iron sights make me a better shooter?</h3><p>If you’re an excellent shot but only with a red dot, aren’t you just really good at using a red dot? Buying a set of iron sights won’t turn you into a designated marksman overnight, but the skills you develop will make you a more rounded shooter.</p><h3>Are BUIS important?</h3><p>Backup iron sights aren’t necessary — until they are. Even if you’re trying to build a super-lightweight rifle, being able to fall back on a reliable set of sights that’s not dependent on batteries or glass can be life-saving.</p>"
iwb holsters,"<h2>FAQs on IWB holsters</h2><h3>Can you sit with an IWB holster?</h3><p>Absolutely. Some inside the waistband holsters are easier to sit for long periods in different positions, based on your body type and how you’re wearing a holster. For some, appendix carry is the best position while in a vehicle. For others, this is the least comfortable. </p><h3>What position do you wear an IWB holster?</h3><p>Any position is viable. The usual positions are strong-side carry and appendix carry. Another is small-of-back carry, but I don’t recommend it. If you fall while carrying that way, you could suffer significant injury to your back. </p><h3>Are IWB holsters comfortable?</h3><p>It depends. A good everyday carry belt can mitigate some issues with some holsters, but cannot make up for bad holster design. Your body type and position of carry will determine comfort levels as well. </p><h3>What is the most comfortable IWB holster?</h3><p>Strong-side carry is generally the most comfortable position. This must be balanced with the other benefits or drawbacks of different carry positions. </p>"
aviation watches,"<h2>FAQs on aviation watches</h2><h3>What watches do real pilots wear?</h3><p>Real pilots, if they wear watches, will often wear digital Garmin GPS watches while flying, offering systems redundancy and precise timekeeping. All watches on this list are more for the tradition-minded aviator.</p><h3>What is an aviation watch?</h3><p>Aviation watches are designed to be easily readable at a glance when flying very quickly, hence why they prioritize high-contrast displays and, in times past, were larger than average.</p><h3>Why do pilots’ watches have a triangle?</h3><p>Some Flieger-style watches will have a triangle, which is to allow a pilot to immediately know where 12 o’clock is at a glance, no matter the orientation of the watch. </p>"
holographic sights,"<h2>FAQs on holographic sights</h2><h3>Are holographic sights better than red dot?</h3><p>Holographic sights have distinct advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional red dots. While they suffer less from things like parallax, astigmatism distortion, and reticle scaling under magnification, they also have lower battery lives, are usually larger, and are almost always more expensive. What works will vary from shooter to shooter, and we encourage anyone to try before they buy.</p><h3>Do holographic sights work with astigmatism?</h3><p>Holographic sights are widely considered to be the best options to use for those with astigmatism, due to the fact that the reticle is a hologram and not a single projected point of light as with a red dot.</p><h3>Can you use a magnifier with a holographic sight?</h3><p>Absolutely. Holographic sights are arguably the best place to use magnifiers, since they will not also increase the size of the reticle, therefore ensuring consistency between magnification levels.</p><h3>Does the U.S. military use magnifiers?</h3><p>Yes. Here are some photos of an EOTech Holographic Hybrid Sight III in use by ANGLICO Marines back in May 2020.</p>"
solar watches,"<h2>FAQs about solar watches</h2><h3>Are solar watches better than automatic watches?</h3><p>Depends on what you consider better. Most are going to be more accurate than automatic watches, simply by virtue of being based around quartz movements. However, many people prefer the novelty of accurate timekeeping through use of springs and gears, so it really is personal preference.</p><h3>How long do solar watches last?</h3><p>The batteries in solar watches are warranted to hold power for 10 years. However, users have observed that solar watches that are regularly exposed to light retain 80 percent of their battery storage capacity even 40 years after installation.</p><h3>Can you replace a battery in a solar watch?</h3><p>Yes, but make sure that your watch is taken to a watchmaker who is familiar with that particular brand’s batteries and other requirements. When in doubt, contact the manufacturer to find authorized service centers.</p><h3>Is a solar watch quartz?</h3><p>Yes, what exactly do you think the solar panel is charging?</p>"
dry fire training systems,"<h2>FAQs about dry fire training systems</h2><h3>Is it difficult to learn how to use laser dry fire training systems?</h3><p>There can be a learning curve with some systems, namely setting up the software or zeroing the laser on laser dry fire training systems like the Mantis Blackbeard, but most of these systems include clear and concise information on how to set it up.</p><h3>What about recoil and loading a magazine?</h3><p>Using a system with force feedback like the CoolFire helps simulate recoil, and systems like the Blackbeard have their power stored in a magazine-shaped battery. The CoolFire doesn’t impede magazine loading, so you can still practice magazine changes that way. For ultimate function, a system like a SIRT laser training pistol is best.</p><h3>Where should I place the target?</h3><p>Depending on your drill, place a target at a realistic engagement distance. The FBI minimum is 21 feet, but factors like being indoors vs outdoors, size of the target, and the system you’re using can affect that.</p><h3>How does laser dry fire training systems help with concealed carry licensing?</h3><p>Certain states have training requirements to qualify for a concealed carry license or permit, and while these tests are not overly onerous in terms of the requirements for accuracy, novice shooters may find a dry fire system helpful to familiarize themselves with their weapon before they go to qualify for their license. In addition, training both dry and live fire is essential to maintain an adequate level of proficiency to reliably ensure that you could defend yourself from an attacker.</p><h3>What kind of lasers do laser dry fire training systems use?</h3><p>Dry fire training systems almost exclusively use Class A lasers, either red, green, or infrared. This is for safety purposes, given that Class A lasers pose minimal risk to the human eye, and they don’t consume much battery power or produce much heat. The different colors are personal preference mostly, but infrared lasers can help shooters not rely on the flash of a laser impact to aim their weapon while still allowing the camera on their phone to pick up the light for scoring purposes on an app like Mantis Laser Academy.</p><h3>How many shots can be fired using the laser dry fire training system?</h3><p>It depends on the system. Most are only limited by battery life and your trigger finger cramping, but systems like the CoolFire have a limited store of compressed CO2 and need to be replenished in between strings of fire.</p><h3>Can I use my laser dry fire training system to train for multiple firearms?</h3><p>It depends on the system. For things like the Mantis X3, it can fit on any firearm with a Picatinny rail, and the software can be programmed for multiple configurations. For the CoolFire, it needs to be purchased for the exact handgun that you plan on shooting with.</p>"
rolling duffel bags,"<h2>FAQs about rolling duffel bags</h2><h3>Are rolling duffle bags better than suitcases?</h3><p>This is rather subjective. Suitcases tend to be hard-bodied or have a rigid form, whereas duffel bags tend to have a soft form that is a little roomier, allowing for packing hefty gear. </p><h3>What is a drop-bottom duffel bag?</h3><p>A drop-bottom duffel is a newer design that’s a suitcase-duffel hybrid. These bags have a separate bottom compartment like the Eberlestock Hercules instead of a singular large open compartment.</p><h3>Can you add wheels to a duffel bag?</h3><p>Yes, if you get creative. It’s easier to just buy a rolling duffel, though. </p><h3>Are rolling duffel bags worth it?</h3><p>Yes. Rolling duffels are great for anyone who has barriers to carrying a duffel the traditional way.</p>"
fishing backpacks,"<h2>FAQs on fishing backpacks</h2><h3>What should be in a fishing backpack?</h3><p>This will be dependent on the fish you’re after, but generally you should always carry pliers, additional line, bait/lures/flies, sunglasses, and a flask of your favorite bourbon.</p><h3>How do I choose a fishing backpack?</h3><p>Determine the type of fishing you wish to pursue. Fly fishermen can generally get away with smaller backpacks. Lure and bait fisherman tend to have a need for more tackle, so a larger backpack may be required.</p><h3>What makes a fishing backpack better than a regular one?</h3><p>A fishing backpack will have features tailored to fishing needs, such as rod holders, plier holders, net sleeves, and cargo space for tackle trays. </p><h3>Can I only use my fishing backpack for fishing?</h3><p>Most fishing backpacks can serve double-duty as camping and day bags, though some are more suited for dual purpose than others.</p><h3>What components should I look for in a fishing backpack?</h3><p>Ultimately, you should look for something comfortable that fits your specific fishing tendencies. Fishermen often spend long periods of time on their feet, so a comfortable bag is a must.</p>"
glock 19 holsters,"<h2>FAQs about Glock 19 holsters</h2><h3>Is it hard to conceal-carry a Glock 19?</h3><p>As long as a good holster is selected, and it is worn with a proper cover garment, concealing a Glock 19 can be done even by smaller-framed people.</p><h3>Q:Can you ankle-carry a Glock 19?</h3><p>You can, but you might have to look in the 1970s-era section of the thrift store for some pants that are flared wide enough.</p><h3>Do Navy SEALs use Glock 19s?</h3><p>Navy SEALs do, in fact, carry the Glock 19, as well as MARSOC and other SOF groups.</p><h3>Will the Glock 17 fit a Glock 19 holster?</h3><p>It depends, but generally speaking, no.</p>"
trauma shears,"<h2>FAQs on trauma shears</h2><h3>Are bandage scissors and trauma shears the same?</h3><p>No. Trauma shears are designed to remove clothing and other barriers to emergency medical treatment. Bandage scissors are multi-purpose scissors primarily found in hospitals and medical clinics and are designed to cut through gauze and bandages only.</p><h3>Are trauma shears sharp?</h3><p>Yes, although not in the most traditional sense. The blades on trauma shears feature fine serrations to make cutting through denim, nylon webbing, rope, and other tough materials easier and faster.</p><h3>How do you know if a pair of trauma shears can be heat-sterilized in an autoclave?</h3><p>Start by checking for an autoclave marking on the handle. If no such marking exists, contact the manufacturer.</p><h3>What scissors do paramedics use?</h3><p>Most paramedics usually carry a pair of trauma shears.</p><h3>Are trauma shears TSA-approved?</h3><p>Yes, the TSA has approved trauma shears for air travel in both carry-on and checked luggage. The only possible exceptions to this rule are the Leatherman Raptor and SOG ParaShears. It appears these shears cannot be stored in a carry-on (probably due to their seatbelt cutters), but placing them in checked baggage won’t be an issue.</p>"
rain ponchos,"<h2>FAQs about rain ponchos</h2><h3>Which is better, a raincoat or poncho?</h3><p>This totally depends on your intended use. If you know you’re going to be in rainy conditions for extended periods, go with a raincoat. If you want something easily donned for sudden rain, the poncho is the way to go.</p><h3>What is the best poncho material?</h3><p>This depends on how much you want to spend. While exotic materials like Dyneema are light and waterproof, most won’t spend that much. Look for durable materials (e.g., ripstop nylon) that don’t feel like a trash bag on your skin.</p><h3>Do rain ponchos keep you warm?</h3><p>In the winter, with a liner, yes. In the spring and summer, ponchos can make you too warm as they tend to trap in heat, so look for designs that help you vent that heat.</p><h3>What is the difference between a serape and poncho?</h3><p>A serape is a cool-looking blanket-like garment that originated in Mexico. The poncho originated in South America and has a slit for the head. Modern ponchos are usually used for foul weather.</p>"
owb holsters,"<h2>FAQs about OWB holsters</h2><h3>Can you conceal an OWB holster?</h3><p>Yep, it can be more challenging, but tons of OWB holsters are designed for concealment.</p><h3>IWB vs. OWB: Which one is better?</h3><p>It depends entirely on the purpose and mission — both have strengths and weaknesses.</p><h3>Is it legal to use an OWB holster?</h3><p>Yep, completely legal. However, competitions might have specific requirements. </p><h3>Is OWB open-carry?</h3><p>It can be open-carry, but is not necessarily open-carry only. </p>"
ballistic glasses,"<h2>FAQs on ballistic glasses</h2><h3>What ballistic glasses does the U.S. military use?</h3><p>Whichever ones are the cheapest and/or have the best lobbyist, we’d assume. Any ballistic glasses that meet the military’s safety standards and satisfy your uniform regulations are likely a significant upgrade.</p><h3>Do ballistic glasses really work?</h3><p>Yes, they do. Ballistic glasses that meet MIL-PRF-31013 standards, in particular, are held to an extremely high standard and offer a great deal of protection against shrapnel.</p><h3>Do ballistic goggles offer more protection than ballistic glasses?</h3><p>Goggles aren’t necessarily a better line of defense against projectiles, but they will keep dust and sweat away from your eyes better than glasses because they fit tightly to your skin. Fogging and heat may be more problematic, though, so there’s no perfect answer.</p>"
tactical pens,"<h2>FAQs on tactical pens</h2><h3>What makes a pen tactical?</h3><p>Apparently, all it takes is metal and some matte-black paint. </p><h3>Do tactical pens work in the rain?</h3><p>Yes — if they don’t, they aren’t actually tactical. I will stand by that opinion.</p><h3>Are tactical pens legal?</h3><p>We’re not aware of any laws specifically banning tactical pens. As always, it’s your responsibility to research your local laws and stay within the lines.</p><h3>Can I bring a tactical pen on a commercial flight?</h3><p>No, the TSA will not let you carry a tactical pen onto a commercial flight. You can put one in your checked luggage, though.</p>"
gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about gun safes</h2><h3>Do I need a gun safe?</h3><p>You may want to use a gun safe for your own reasons, but there may be laws and regulations in place where you live. Check your local laws and base regulations to make sure you’re within your lateral limits.</p><h3>Are gun safes fireproof or EMP-proof?</h3><p>Some gun safes protect against one of these threats, some protect against both, and some protect against neither. Look for safes that have been fire-tested if that’s a concern. Mechanical safes are your best bet in the case of an EMP attack.</p><h3>Do gun safes keep moisture out?</h3><p>No, but you have a few options. The easiest is to keep your guns well-oiled, which you should be doing anyway if you live in a humid environment. Moisture-absorbing silica can also be a cheap solution. If you’re really concerned, get a gun safe dehumidifier. </p>"
tactical watches,"<h2>FAQs about tactical watches</h2><h3>How durable are tactical watches?</h3><p>As durable as possible, ideally. Look for watches with good water resistance, ISO certifications related to durability, and scratch-resistant glass to keep your watch ticking at all times</p><h3>Do tactical watches have smartwatch capabilities?</h3><p>Absolutely. The Garmin Fenix is an example of a tactical watch that can display your mobile device’s notifications, cycle music, track your steps, and more.</p><h3>Can tactical watches be set to military time?</h3><p>Ideally yes, especially with the digital ones, most tactical watches have an option to display time in a 24-hour format. </p><h3>Why do military service members wear their watches backwards?</h3><p>I’ve heard everything from wanting to not allow the glint of the crystal to flash in the sun and reveal your position to snipers, to wanting to protect the crystal from getting shattered, all the way to wanting to be able to read the time while aiming your weapon downrange. I’m not sure which I believe, and which I dismiss as just “my uncle who claims he was a SEAL in Vietnam said this.”</p>"
dump pouches,"<h2>FAQs about dump pouches</h2><h3>Does the military use dump pouches?</h3><p>Service members throughout the military use dump pouches for a variety of reasons. Snacks, Nalgenes, mags, and SSE are the big four reasons for doing so.</p><h3>Where do you put a dump pouch?</h3><p>Almost everyone will tell you that dump pouches belong on your belt. For some reason beyond my understanding, people have also put them on their plate carriers. That is a process.</p><h3>What do soldiers do with empty mags?</h3><p>It depends on the situation. The goal is to retain your mags in some way (dump pouch), even when empty, but the situation might not always permit that.</p>"
camping lighters,"<h2>FAQs about camping lighters</h2><h3>What is the most reliable lighter?</h3><p>Most lighter types — flint-and-wick style, ferro rods with magnesium, and stormproof matches — are all extremely reliable fire starters. Butane lighters, especially those ignited with a piezo spark, have several potential mechanical failure points.</p><h3>What’s better for camping, matches or lighters?</h3><p>They’re very different. While I wouldn’t recommend taking some generic kitchen matches on your next adventure, stormproof matches are very reliable. If you are going on a long backpacking trip, you’ll certainly run out of matches before you’re through and, therefore, should have a dependable lighter on hand, as well.</p><h3>What is the best windproof camping lighter?</h3><p>If wind resistance is your number one consideration, then an arc/plasma/electric lighter is the answer. The arc generated by these lighters is almost impossible to extinguish with the wind.</p>"
plasma lighters,"<h2>FAQs on plasma lighters</h2><h3>How do plasma lighters work?</h3><p>When activated, plasma lighters charge opposing poles to create an intense exchange of electricity that creates a large amount of heat along a concentrated path. Place flammable material into the purple arc or arcs to light it. </p><h3>Are plasma lighters better than traditional lighters?</h3><p>Plasma lighters are better than traditional lighters in certain ways. Plugging in a USB cable is cleaner than pouring lighter fluid. Being able to recharge your lighter indefinitely with a small solar panel can be more practical than packing extra lighter fluid. Plasma lighters also perform better in bad weather.</p><h3>How long does a plasma lighter last on one charge?</h3><p>Most of the plasma lighters we’ve seen are advertised as being able to provide 300 lights on one charge. Your experience may vary depending on external factors, but that’s a good benchmark.</p>"
rowing machines under 500,"<h2>FAQs on rowing machines under $500</h2><h3>Can you lose belly fat on a rowing machine?</h3><p>Yes, along with any other fat you want to see gone, especially when combined with a proper diet.  </p><h3>Does rowing tone your arms?</h3><p>Absolutely. While the proper rowing exercise works the whole body, the arm and back muscles are the heavy lifters and get the most work.</p><h3>How many minutes should I row at a time?</h3><p>If you’re looking for cardio-based results, you’ll need to row for 30-60 minutes at a time. However, if you’re looking for strength, conditioning, or intense fat burning it is best to do interval training or row for 20 minutes at a time. </p><h3>What’s the best type of rower?</h3><p>This is purely subjective, but water rowers offer the most realistic rowing workout, while dual resistance rowers offer the most challenging workouts.</p>"
rechargeable flashlights,"<h2>FAQs on rechargeable flashlights</h2><h3>What is the highest lumen rechargeable flashlight?</h3><p>We’re not sure what the record is, but Surefire makes a wicked rechargeable weapon light aptly named the Hellfighter that puts out 3,000 lumens and costs nearly $10,000.</p><h3>Are rechargeable flashlights any good?</h3><p>Absolutely. There will always be variations from product to product, but the rechargeable flashlights on this list can hold their own against any traditional flashlight.</p><h3>How many lumens should a good flashlight have?</h3><p>That depends on your activity. Reading a book or checking a map can be done with less than 50 lumens. Walking in the dark is better served by 750 to 1,000 lumens, and some tasks call for even more.</p><h3>How long can a rechargeable flashlight hold a charge?</h3><p>Battery life can be tricky to calculate because it’s easily affected by other components and environmental factors. The flashlights you see here last several hours on a single charge, and some can go all night.</p>"
biometric gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about biometric gun safes</h2><h3>Are biometric safes secure?</h3><p>Biometric scanners are just as secure as traditional or digital locking mechanisms, but a gun safe is only as secure as the materials it’s made out of. </p><h3>How reliable are biometric locks?</h3><p>Biometric systems are mostly reliable with most owners having no quarrel once they’re properly programmed, but there’s always bound to be some hiccups, especially on some cheaper models. A few have issues where they easily unlock or don’t unlock at all, and never forget to check that battery!</p><h3>Are biometric gun safes corrosion-resistant?</h3><p>With many products on this list constructed of steel alloys or high-carbon steels sealed in protective coatings, it can be concluded that high-quality gun safes are definitely corrosion-resistant. Buyers should be more cautious about the innards of inferior safes that could potentially corrode the guns themselves.</p><h3>How do I know when it’s time to change the battery on my safe?</h3><p>Most safes can alert you to low batteries via a displayed message, intermittent beeps, or an LED warning light, with the latter being the most common. In case it’s totally dead, and none of the electronics have power, always ensure that the manual backup keys are nearby.</p>"
concealed carry holsters,"<h2>FAQs on concealed carry holsters</h2><h3>What is the most comfortable holster for concealed carry?</h3><p>It’s a matter of preference, but most people agree OWB rigs are the most comfortable option. </p><h3>What should I look for in a holster?</h3><p>In order of most important to least: safety, fit, concealment, access, easy reholstering, and then comfort. </p><h3>What is the most comfortable concealed carry position?</h3><p>Strongside OWB or IWB is often considered the most comfortable position. </p><h3>What makes a great concealed carry holster?</h3><p>A form-fitting and thoughtful design makes a great holster. Without one, you have a pocket, not a holster. </p>"
gun cases,"<h2>FAQs about gun cases</h2><h3>What type of gun cases are TSA-approved?</h3><p>If you plan to travel with a firearm, the TSA requires you use a lockable hard-sided case. They also require that you check the bag and store ammunition separately. See the TSA guidelines here. </p><h3>Do guns come with a case?</h3><p>It depends on the manufacturer. Most handguns are sold inside of a case, but most rifles and shotguns are not.</p>"
camping tarps,"<h2>FAQs on camping tarps</h2><h3>What size tarp do I need?</h3><p>This depends on intent. For individual A-frames, you can get by with something small, like a 6 x 8 foot tarp. If you are looking to cover a cooking area or create a communal space for several people, aim for something much bigger.</p><h3>Should I put a tarp under my tent?</h3><p>Sure. A tarp under your tent will create a barrier between you and the ground. It’s the same logic as wearing underwear under your pants. You don’t have to, but you’d probably be more comfortable if you did.</p><h3>How do you keep a camping tarp dry?</h3><p>You don’t. It keeps you dry. That’s the point. (After camping trips, I usually string up my gear in my garage to let it air out for a day or two).</p><h3>Can I use a tarp as a rain fly?</h3><p>Yes, but keep in mind the breathability of the tarp and the spacing over the tarp. A thick tarp placed too low can make your tent stuffy and unbearable in a hurry.<br/>"
mens watches,"<h2>FAQs about men’s watches</h2><h3>What is the hottest watch right now?</h3><p>Watches like the Richard Mille RM-01, Patek Philippe Nautilus, and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, often jewel-encrusted, are seen on the wrists of musicians and other celebrities, due to the fact that they are extremely expensive and extremely rare, often as a status symbol. These watches are oftentimes not owned by the person wearing them but are loaned to them by the company as part of a marketing deal to encourage people to aspire to own a $200,000 watch some day.</p><h3>What is the most popular watch?</h3><p>The Rolex Submariner is arguably the most recognizable watch, to the point that people who don’t know anything about watches can recognize it as “a rollie.” This is due to the watch’s connection with famous movie characters, excellent marketing deals done with sports, movies, and musicians to get the brand more exposure, and artificial scarcity, where Rolex actively controls who can and can’t buy their watches.<br/></p><h3>What is a luxury watch?</h3><p>A luxury watch is a watch that is, by definition, difficult to obtain. Whether due to cost, availability, or both, luxury watches are exclusive and are more pieces of art than they are time-telling devices. These watches are owned as heirlooms, mementos, or status symbols, and are often only sold through specific dealers. Examples of luxury brands are Rolex, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Vacheron Contstantin, Breguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre, and A. Lange & Sohne.</p><h3>How do you know if a watch is good quality?</h3><p>First, evaluate the watch based on materials. In general, things like steel cases, sapphire crystals, and solid link bracelets are good things. Then, research the brand and make sure it has a reputation for quality. Third, avoid heavily advertised “fashion watches” like MVMT, Vincero, Valuchi, and so forth. These companies simply rebrand Chinese watches for a 10-times markup. Finally, look at what else might affect the price. Is it a limited edition? Is it rare? Was it featured in a movie? Is it no longer produced? In general, if a watch is vastly cheaper than a more popular option, it’s not because you’re getting some sweet secret deal, it’s because the watch is actually made of lower-quality materials.</p><h3>What does a watch say about a man?</h3><p>I’ll answer this one with an anecdote. A former boss of mine once said that whenever a young man came in for an interview wearing a large, ostentatious watch, he would ask him the time. If the man went for his cell phone, it showed that the watch was just there for show and/or it wasn’t actually set, and let my boss identify people who were pretentious or ostentatious. Whether that’s a good judge of character or not, I’ll leave it up to you.<br/></p>"
paracord bracelets,"<h2>FAQs about paracord bracelets</h2><h3>How can you use paracord bracelets?</h3><p>Paracord and its core strands are perfect for survival tasks like setting snares/traps, fishing, creating shelter, or starting a fire. You can really use it for any task you need rope for, even replacing bootlaces. </p><h3>How can you wash your paracord bracelet?</h3><p>Since I’ve only ever worn dark-colored paracord bracelets, I’ve never had to wash mine. That being said, the Paracord Guild has some great tips on keeping your fancy paracord fancy.</p><h3>How much weight will the paracord hold?</h3><p>This depends on the thickness and rating of the cord. Common paracord is capable of holding up to 550 pounds. </p><h3>What do paracord bracelets represent?</h3><p>They can represent anything the wearer wants them to. Typically, there are accessories added to give the bracelets meaning, but color choices and patterns can also indicate a meaning. </p><h3>Do soldiers wear paracord bracelets?</h3><p>Some do, it depends on unit and branch uniform regulations, though. While I was on active duty between 2006 and 2011, we were allowed to wear black, OD green, or coyote brown paracord bracelets while in uniform. </p>"
gunsmithing tools,"<h2>FAQs about gunsmithing tools</h2><h3>What starting tools does a home gunsmith need?</h3><p>Gunsmithing-specific screwdrivers, quality pin punches, a gunsmithing hammer, and strongly consider getting a gun vise and bench block.</p><h3>Can gunsmiths handle gun restoration work?</h3><p>Talk to your local gunsmith. Not all gunsmiths will be capable of detailed restoration work. </p><h3>Is it legal to be a gunsmith?</h3><p>Yes. While there are no laws regulating gunsmiths, do make sure your gunsmith has attended some kind of formal training (typically a six-month technical college course).</p>"
heated gloves,"<h2>FAQs on heated gloves</h2><h3>What are the best heated gloves for Raynaud’s disease?</h3><p>Any heated gloves can be helpful for people who experience Reynaud’s. According to Johns Hopkins, one of the best ways to manage this condition is to keep your fingers warm and dry.</p><h3>Who makes the warmest winter gloves?</h3><p>There are many companies that sell quality winter gloves. Brands that cater to winter sports and work tend to be the best, but not all of them offer heated gloves. A few of the best options are right here on this list.</p><h3>Can you wash heated gloves?</h3><p>Always check the label on your gloves for the most accurate information about cleaning them. How they can be washed will depend on how the electrical system is built, but also on the other types of materials used to build the glove. </p>"
camping flashlights,"<h2>FAQs on camping flashlights</h2><h3>Why do you need a flashlight for camping?</h3><p>There are a variety of reasons including night hiking, setting up camp, cooking, searching for gear in the dark, and, of course, the ever-popular snipe hunt.</p><h3>How many lumens do I need for a camping flashlight?</h3><p>While lumens do not directly correlate to peak beam intensity, we recommend at least 1,000 lumens for a camping flashlight.  </p><h3>How far will 1,000 lumens shine?</h3><p>Lumens do not directly correlate to peak beam intensity; therefore, we recommend looking at the peak beam distance rating for each light and selecting one that can illuminate objects at least 100 meters away.</p>"
waterproof backpacks,"<h2>FAQs on waterproof backpacks</h2><h3>How much does a good waterproof backpack cost?</h3><p>Our most affordable pick starts right around $60 and prices go as high as $320. Spending more will generally get you more durable construction and superior waterproofing, but most of our favorites cost about $100 and are a solid choice for most uses. </p><h3>Can you make a backpack waterproof?</h3><p>Waterproof treatments are available and are popular for adding water-resistance to boots. You can use them on a backpack, but the treatment isn’t on par with what you see here and will wear off relatively quickly. Keep in mind that waterproof treatments can’t seal your pack’s zippers.</p>"
rifle cases,"<h2>FAQs about rifle cases</h2><h3>What type of gun cases are TSA-approved?</h3><p>TSA requirements for a gun case are that it be hard-shelled, locked, and the firearm must be unloaded. The firearm must also be declared at check-in, and cannot be in carry-on luggage, checked baggage only. Note that ammunition must not be accessible, meaning you cannot store the ammunition in the same case as the firearm.</p><h3>Is a hard rifle case better than a soft rifle case?</h3><p>This depends entirely on your needs. For TSA purposes, a hard rifle case is mandatory, but for other day-to-day uses, a soft case might better serve your needs. For scoped rifles, a hard case is usually preferable, as it better protects the optics from being rattled out of zero.</p><h3>Do rifle cases lock?</h3><p>Not all rifle cases are lockable. If you’re going to purchase a case for flying, make sure you check this first. Most manufacturers offer lockable TSA-compliant firearms cases.</p><h3>Can I fly with two guns in a case?</h3><p>There are no rules against multiple firearms in a single case. As long as the case is locked, and no ammunition is present in the case, you’re clear to fly.</p>"
fleece jackets,"<h2>FAQs on fleece jackets</h2><h3>What is the warmest fleece jacket?</h3><p>The warmest fleece jacket I’ve found on the market is a toss-up between the Patagonia Retro-X and the North Face Denali 2. The former is made from high-loft Sherpa fleece and the latter from Polartec 300. </p><h3>What is the thickest fleece jacket?</h3><p>Definitely, jackets made with Sherpa fleece.<br/></p><h3>What’s the difference between fleece and microfleece?</h3><p>Chemically, they’re the same fabric. Microfleece is just a lighter version — typically below 100 g/m2 in weight.</p><h3>What is the difference between fleece and polar fleece?</h3><p>Fleece is a general term applied to synthetic polyester material derived from plastic. Polar fleece is heavier and more durable, in common weights of 100, 200, or 300 g/m2.</p>"
generators for camping,"<h2>FAQs about camping generators</h2><h3>Why would you need a generator while camping?</h3><p>Generators can power things like refrigerated coolers, grills, lights, fans, and heaters to make your campsite feel more like home. Backpackers will have to make do with a power bank, but car and RV camping can get a serious upgrade from a generator.</p><h3>What size generator do I need for camping?</h3><p>That depends on how much power you use. Add up the power consumption of each device you plan on plugging in, factor in how much time you’ll be using it, and go from there. Think about how much access you’ll have to fuel or solar energy, too.</p><h3>What’s the difference between inverter generators and portable generators?</h3><p>Inverter generators are more efficient because they can adjust engine speed depending on electricity demand. Traditional portable generators run at a constant engine speed; that makes them very reliable but loud and thirsty. <br/>"
pocket knives,"<h2>FAQs on pocket knives</h2><h3>Is it legal to carry a pocket knife with you?</h3><p>In most situations, carrying a reasonably sized pocket knife is legal (usually) with the exception of a few locations, such as public schools, airports, and many government buildings. That said, American knife laws are a patchwork of legislation, so make sure to check your state and local statutes to keep everyone happy.</p><h3>Can I carry a pocket knife for self defense?</h3><p>To the best of our knowledge, the answer is “usually”. That said, self defense with a blade is both a skill and an art, so make sure you get proper training in self-defense law, de-escalation techniques, and knife fighting tactics. Again, laws vary, so do some research specific to your city and state.</p><h3>How big of a pocket knife can you carry?</h3><p>Once again, this varies depending on where you live. Almost all jurisdictions seem to allow pocket knives with a maximum blade length of 2.5 inches, but many states allow for a three-inch blade maximum (or longer). When in doubt, err for a shorter knife, as longer blades tend to attract unwanted attention, legal and otherwise.</p>"
tactical flashlights,"<h2>FAQs about tactical flashlights</h2><h3>What is the brightest tactical flashlight?</h3><p>The brightest tactical flashlight from a reputable brand is the Nitecore TM20K. It features 20,000 lumens, which is insane.</p><h3>What is the most reliable tactical flashlight?</h3><p>Many users swear by SureFire flashlights due to their durability, water resistance, and solid soldering.</p><h3>What is the most powerful tactical flashlight?</h3><p>The most powerful tactical flashlight by a reputable brand is the 20,000-lumen Nitecore TM20K. </p><h3>What kind of tactical flashlight does the military use?</h3><p>Most U.S. service members use Petzl, Energizer, or Princeton Tec headlamps for standard tasks, but SureFire lights have long been the standard for weapon-mounted lights for their durability and reliability.</p><h3>How many lumens should a good tactical flashlight have?</h3><p>As many as are needed for the job at hand. Other factors like beam tightness, throw distance, battery consumption, size, and heat issues are at play here, so getting a high lumen count is important for raw illumination, but comes with other factors as well.</p>"
cycling shoes,"<h2>FAQs on cycling shoes</h2><h3>Do cycling shoes make a difference?</h3><p>Absolutely. I was a skeptic at first, but the increased performance and the power transfer (a phrase I use perhaps 100 times in this guide) is undeniable. Cycling shoes are a must for those wanting to up their cycling game.</p><h3>Do all bike shoes fit all pedals?</h3><p>No. A bike shoe itself doesn’t fit anything. It needs a cleat (usually sold separately), and you need to make sure the cleat you use is designed to fit the pedal you’re using. For your first shoe, it’s smart to buy the pedal and cleat at the same time.</p><h3>How stiff should my cycling shoes be?</h3><p>A mid-range stiffness rating is a good place to start. If you’re a more experienced rider looking to improve performance, start moving up the scale.</p><h3>Is there a uniform stiffness index used by all shoes?</h3><p>No! It’s annoying, but each shoe company uses its own index, so comparison of stiffness between brands is difficult. </p>"
sweatpants for men,"<h2>FAQs on sweatpants for men</h2><h3>Are sweatpants winter attire?</h3><p>You can wear sweatpants year-round! I’ve got some that are cut into shorts for the summer and they perform just as excellently as the full-length variety. Pro tip: Only wear sweatpants with an elastic cuff outside during the winter so they don’t drag in the snow and get wet.</p><h3>Are sweatpants workplace-appropriate?</h3><p>Probably not, but that says more about your stodgy work environment than the textile wonder that is sweatpants. That’s not how we roll; in fact, I’m wearing a pair as I write this.</p><h3>Can I wear these bad boys to the gym?</h3><p>Sweatpants are great for the gym, especially during the winter when you need to keep your muscles warm on the way to the gym. Baggy sweatpants offer a great range of motion, too. Cuffed pants are best because they don’t interfere with your footing.</p><h3>Why don’t we wear these all the time?</h3><p>That question has been asked since the first elastic band was sewn into baggy loungewear. My theory is that the world just isn’t ready.</p>"
backpack brands,"<h2>FAQs about backpack brands</h2><h3>How should backpacks fit?</h3><p>The heavier your backpack is, the more you should care about how it fits. To fit an adjustable backpack properly, enlist the help of a friend and check out this fitment guide.</p><h3>Which brand of backpack is best for college?</h3><p>Something that’s not overtly tactical might be a good choice, lest you become “that guy.” It’s also a smart idea to pick something that can double as an adventure pack on the weekend when you want to take a study break. You can’t go wrong with something like The North Face Borealis.</p><h3>Which is the best tactical backpack brand?</h3><p>There are a lot of great tactical backpack brands, but some of our staff favorites include Mystery Ranch, Eberlestock, and LBT.</p><h3>How should you clean a backpack?</h3><p>Always check the manufacturer’s recommendations. In general, it’s hard to go wrong with warm water and mild soap. Be particularly mindful of letting your backpack dry completely before putting it away to prevent damage from mold.</p>"
winter hiking boots,"<h2>FAQs on winter hiking boots</h2><h3>Can hiking boots be used as winter boots?</h3><p>This depends on what you mean by “winter boots.” If you mean a pair of boots for running errands, shoveling the driveway, etc., then sure. If you mean boots for sledding or other snow sports, they could still work but likely not as well as dedicated snow boots.</p><h3>Can you wear hiking boots everyday?</h3><p>Absolutely. That said, consider passing the next time you attend a white tie event.</p><h3>How do I keep snow off my hiking boots?</h3><p>Keep out of snow drifts and stay inside when it snows. If you decide to ignore this advice, then pay attention to where you step or invest in a pair of snow gaiters. You won’t keep snow off your boots entirely, but assuming they fit you well, all you’ll get is a dusting.</p>"
headlamps for hunting,"<h2>FAQs about headlamps for hunting</h2><h3>What is the brightest headlamp for hunting?</h3><p>How much light do you need? You could get a headlamp with a claimed 10,000 lumens, but the brightest headlamp may not be the best headlamp for hunting.</p><h3>What is a red light used for on headlamps?</h3><p>Red light creates less glare than white light. It’s also easier on your eyes, so they can adapt more quickly to the darkness when you’re done using your light.</p><h3>Can deer see red or green light?</h3><p>There is evidence to suggest that, because of a condition called protanopia, deer cannot detect red or green lights.</p><h3>How many lumens do I need for hunting?</h3><p>That depends on what kind of hunting you have in mind. If you just need to get situated in your blind, a 50-lumen glow is adequate. If you’re trying to spot hogs across an open field, you’ll need an actual spotlight.</p>"
tactical knives,"<h2>FAQs about tactical knives</h2><h3>Where should I carry my tactical knife?</h3><p>This depends entirely on the knife, and what your local restrictions are. Some municipalities disallow open carry, while others only allow open carry. Some limit where you can carry knives in general. As always, it’s best to be informed before you pack up to head out. KnifeUp.com is a fantastic source for up-to-date information.</p><h3>What type of tactical knife is best for self-defense?</h3><p>The one you train with. No, really. As with a firearm, if you aren’t training with it, you shouldn’t be carrying it for self-defense — you’ll only be endangering yourself.</p><h3>What is the best length for a tactical knife?</h3><p>Depending on your intended use, you may need a longer or a shorter blade. In general, though, you’ll want to stick with a two- to four-inch blade for concealed carry, while you can get away with longer blades when you’re open-carrying out in the field. Just make sure to check your local regulations before you do so.</p>"
running hats,"<h2>FAQs about running hats</h2><h3>Is it bad to wear a hat while running?</h3><p>No. Wearing a hat is a personal preference, just like wearing a long sleeve or short sleeve shirt. </p><h3>How do I keep my head warm while running?</h3><p>Wear a hat or beanie.</p><h3>Are running hats washable? </h3><p>Most should be. Make sure to check the tag on your hats for detailed care instructions. </p>"
weightlifting gloves,"<h2>FAQs about weightlifting gloves</h2><h3>Should you wear gloves when lifting weights?</h3><p>No, for the majority of lifters out there. Folks who have sensitive skin, sensory issues, or jobs that require an obvious lack of calluses have legitimate reasons to wear workout gloves. Men’s Health does a great job of explaining this in more detail. </p><h3>Do gloves help with deadlift?</h3><p>They can, but don’t rely solely on gloves to complete the lift. Focus your accessory work on the forearms and grip strength with lifts like rack pulls or just hanging from the pullup bar. The gloves will only protect your hands from getting torn up.</p><h3>Are weight lifting gloves cheating?</h3><p>No more than wearing running shoes would be. If you need to wear gloves to work out consistently, then keep on wearing them. </p><h3>Do weight lifting gloves prevent calluses?</h3><p>Yes, which is why most people wear them. If you’re a heavy sweater, I’d encourage using a little baby powder to prevent blisters that could turn into calluses. </p>"
citizen watches,"<h2>FAQs about Citizen watches</h2><h3>How accurate is a Citizen automatic watch?</h3><p>Citizen automatic watches in the 8000-series are rated to plus or minus 20 seconds per day, but usually perform much better, especially if you regulate them.</p><h3>Are Citizen watches waterproof? </h3><p>Citizen watches aren’t waterproof, since the preferred term is “water-resistant.” Nothing is truly waterproof. However, all of the watches on this list feature a good level of water resistance, and both of the Promaster divers are officially certified for SCUBA diving. Additionally, Citizen is credited with making the deepest-rated solar watch ever.</p><h3>Are Citizen watches high-end?</h3><p>Citizen has some great high-end watches. The Caliber 0100 is on par with any Swiss watch you put it against, at the very least, and the newer automatic variant, the Series 8, seeks to recapture the performance luxury market.</p><h3>Are Citizen watches better than Rolex?</h3><p>I don’t know any Rolex watches that keep time to within a second per year. Then again, they’ve never tried.</p>"
hiking shorts,"<h2>FAQs about hiking shots</h2><h3>What should you not wear while hiking?</h3><p>Avoid tight pants, leggings, or other pants or shorts that stick to your skin. Jeans and thick fabric is also a bad idea, as is clothing that is 100 percent cotton or silk. </p><h3>Is it better to hike in pants or shorts?</h3><p>Shorts are fine if you’re planning a day hike in warm weather on a trail that’s rated easy to moderately difficult. However, shorts provide less protection on rugged trails, in inclement weather, and on longer hikes in which the conditions are more challenging or less predictable. </p><h3>Why do thru-hikers wear shorts?</h3><p>Some hikers prefer to wear shorts because they are cooler and provide more mobility than pants. </p><h3>How do you keep ticks off when hiking?</h3><p>One way to avoid ticks is to wear insect repellent. You can also spray your clothing and gear with the insecticide permethrin. If you wear light-colored clothing, ticks will also be easier to spot so you can remove them.</p>"
camping pillows,"<h2>FAQs about camping pillows</h2><h3>Can you use regular pillows for camping?</h3><p>You can use regular pillows for camping, and some people do. The problem is regular pillows are not designed to be used in an outdoor environment and are much more prone to soiling, staining, and ruin. They also are not very packable for backpackers.</p><h3>How do I wash my camping pillow?</h3><p>It depends on the camping pillow. Some have removable covers that are machine-washable. Some must be hand-washed and air-dried. It’s always best to check the manufacturer’s instructions to be sure.</p><h3>How do you keep a pillow on a sleeping pad?</h3><p>Many camping pillows have a contoured design that allows them to be used inside a sleeping bag hood, and keeps the pillow centered over the shoulders and neck. Some manufacturers may include non-slip fabric to prevent pillows from sliding.</p><h3>Are camping pillows worth it?</h3><p>Absolutely. Many camping pillows provide remarkable support and comfort using materials designed to survive the use and abuse of camping outdoors.</p>"
canvas backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about canvas backpacks</h2><h3>Are canvas backpacks waterproof?</h3><p>Canvas backpacks are water–resistant, not waterproof. However, a waxed canvas backpack improves water resistance by filling in the gaps between the fibers. </p><h3>Is canvas the most durable material for backpacks?</h3><p>Honestly, no. In testing, nylon was more abrasion-resistant, while being lighter, Additionally, canvas tends to be more flammable than nylon. That said, canvas is still a rugged material, and you can rest assured that a canvas backpack will serve you well. </p><h3>How do you keep canvas backpacks clean?</h3><p>Canvas backpacks can be cleaned by spot-washing the affected area with some hot soapy water. They should not, however, be placed in a washing machine.</p>"
battle ropes,"<h2>FAQs about battle ropes</h2><h3>How do you anchor battle ropes?</h3><p>All you need is something to hold the center of the rope still while you use each end. That can be a purpose-built anchor attached to a post or something like a heavy sandbag placed over the rope.</p><h3>Are battle ropes for cardio or strength training?</h3><p>Battle ropes are used for high-intensity training that can improve muscular strength, endurance, and power. You’ll be using compound movements that translate to real-world fitness in a wide range of applications.</p><h3>What muscles do battle ropes work?</h3><p>Because battle ropes require compound movements, you’ll be using several muscle groups. They’re primarily designed to activate the arms, chest, shoulders, and upper back. In order to maintain a stable platform, you’ll need to maintain tension in your legs and core, as well.</p>"
military socks,"<h2>FAQs about military socks</h2><h3>What are the best military socks?</h3><p>The best military socks depend on your environment and usage. More cushioning is better for long-term heavy-duty usage, but thinner socks breathe better. Cotton is better for dry, hot environments, but not great if there’s a chance of water. This list will help you choose accordingly.</p><h3>Why do soldiers need specific socks?</h3><p>Wet and dirty feet can literally kill you in a tactical environment. Wet socks cause peeled, rotting skin, and can facilitate the growth of fungus, germs, and other infections. Military boots are also taller than hiking boots, to keep out dirt, insects, and other debris, meaning that ankle socks are a no-go. Because of this, specialized socks are necessary.</p><h3>Do Marines wear black socks?</h3><p>Always have, always will.</p>"
camping mugs,"<h2>FAQs about camping mugs</h2><h3>Can I cook with an enamel mug?</h3><p>Absolutely. An enamel mug is designed to take a direct flame, which is why they’ve been so popular with campers for decades. The uninsulated metal ensures a quick heat transfer, but be sure to move it around a bit just to avoid warping, especially if your mug is old. </p><h3>What are BPAs and why do they matter when buying a mug?</h3><p>BPA stands for bisphenol A. It’s a chemical found in certain types of plastic material. Why it matters to campers is that some storage products containing BPA have been found to seep into the food and liquids they carried. While studies are still ongoing, there is a correlation between known BPA consumption and negative effects on the brain and prostate glands of babies and young children. Additionally, new studies have shown there may also be a connection between the ingestion of BPA and heart issues. This is why most non-metal mugs will explicitly state they are BPA-free. </p>"
running shoes for women,"<h2>FAQs on running shoes for women</h2><h3>If I have flat feet, is there a certain type of running shoe I should buy?</h3><p>Absolutely. If you have verified that you have flat feet by visiting a running store or doing a wet footprint test, you should probably consider purchasing neutral shoes.</p><h3>Does a more expensive shoe make it a better one?</h3><p>Absolutely not, and the Saucony Cohesion 12 is a great example of how a less expensive shoe can actually rival the performance of pricier options for comfort, cushioning, and design. Shoe preference is also highly subjective since every body and foot is unique, so do your research and don’t be afraid to test out different shoes on a treadmill at the running store before you buy a pair. And don’t forget that shoes are like cars — the previous year’s model always goes on sale at some point.</p><h3>What can I do to bring the cost of new running shoes down?</h3><p>Manufacturers rarely develop technology that is so incredible in a given year that it’s worth paying more for a new year’s shoe model. Search for the previous model online and you will be sure to save up to 60 percent. </p>"
duffel bags,"<h2>FAQs on duffel bags</h2><h3>What’s the biggest duffel bag size?</h3><p>There is a limit to sizing, but the Eberlestock Hercules is 192 liters and the largest I’ve been able to find. </p><h3>How big is an Army duffle bag?</h3><p>Sea bags like the Rothco G.I. Canvas duffel are typically 38L x 22W x 22D inches.</p><h3>How do you secure a military duffle bag?</h3><p>Old-school sea bags have a metal loop that you can put a padlock through. </p><h3>Are Army duffle bags waterproof?</h3><p>No, the canvas is treated to be weather-resistant though. </p><h3>What are Army duffel bags made of?</h3><p>Sea bags are made from a durable cotton canvas. </p>"
compact binoculars,"<h2>FAQs on compact binoculars</h2><h3>What do the numbers on binoculars mean?</h3><p>Binoculars are numbered based on magnification power and size of the objective lens. A pair marked 8×26 would make the image you see appear eight times larger than it is and use a lens that’s 26 millimeters in diameter.</p><h3>Why is it hard to see through my binoculars?</h3><p>Binoculars need to be adjusted to your eyes to work properly. Set the eyecups directly in front of each eye, find proper eye relief (distance between the binoculars and your eyes), and focus based on viewing distance.</p><h3>Can I use binoculars with glasses?</h3><p>Absolutely! Adjustable eyecups make it possible to tweak binoculars to match your eyes. Some binoculars are better at this than others, and Best Binocular Reviews has a great article on how to make your binoculars and glasses work together.</p>"
pull up bars,"<h2>FAQs about pull-up bars</h2><h3>Do pull-up bars damage walls?</h3><p>You can seriously damage your walls by installing a pull-up bar incorrectly. Check your installation manual and invest in helpful tools like a stud finder, drill, and the correct hardware for your specific pull-up bar and mounting surface to avoid any problems. </p><h3>Do no-screw pull-up bars work?</h3><p>Yes, but some are better than others. Doorway pull-up bars that use leverage to grip the door frame are more secure than bars that press against the inside of the doorway. </p><h3>Are pull-up bars safe at home?</h3><p>If you buy a quality pull-up bar and install it correctly, you shouldn’t have any problems (unless someone catches you kipping).</p><h3>Are pull-up bars worth it?</h3><p>Pull-ups are one of the best bodyweight exercises for overall fitness. Even if you don’t go all-in on a home gym, getting your own pull-up bar can be a great way to boost your athletic performance.</p>"
ankle weights,"<h2>FAQs about ankle weights</h2><h3>Can ankle weights be used when running or walking?</h3><p>No. Medical professionals advise against wearing ankle weights while running or walking. They say it can strain your ankle joints or cause muscle imbalance. Overall, you increase the risk of injuring your hips, back, and knees if you wear them for those activities. If you do want extra resistance during cardio, they recommend wearing a weighted vest instead. </p><h3>How heavy should my ankle weights be?</h3><p>Most experts recommend using ankle weights that weigh one to three percent of your body weight. However, ankle weights are often available weighing anywhere from one to 10 pounds. </p><h3>What’s the best way to use ankle weights?</h3><p>Ankle weight exercises are typically limited to lower body and core workouts, but the additional weight will make pull-ups and chin-ups more challenging as well. Additionally, physical therapists like to use ankle weights to improve the walking gait in older adults or rehabbing patients who suffered a stroke.</p>"
aviator sunglasses,"<h2>FAQs about aviator sunglasses</h2><h3>How much do aviator sunglasses cost?</h3><p>You can find knock-offs online or at your local gas station for a few bucks, but they’ll fall apart almost immediately. The aviator shades on this gear guide cost between $40 and $250 (at full MSRP).</p><h3>Do women wear aviators?</h3><p>Yes, and they should because everyone deserves to look this cool.</p><h3>What face shape looks good with aviator sunglasses?</h3><p>According to the people at Esquire (who are far more style-conscious than I am), traditional, teardrop aviators look best on diamond- and heart-shaped faces. I’d argue that anyone and everyone looks good in aviators. </p><h3>Are expensive aviator sunglasses really better?</h3><p>Sunglasses aren’t complicated, but build quality does matter. High-end sunglasses benefit from better materials and manufacturing techniques than cheap ones, though how much that’s worth is up to you.</p><h3>What’s the best way to clean aviator sunglasses?</h3><p>All About Vision has a step-by-step guide to cleaning glasses, but it boils down to gentle soap and a soft, lint-free cloth.</p>"
headlamps,"<h2>FAQs on headlamps</h2><h3>How many lumens should a good headlamp have?</h3><p>If you need to read a map or move around a campsite, a basic headlamp with around 200 lumens is sufficient. Action sports require you to see further ahead as you increase speed, so a headlamp with 750 to 1,000 lumens might be a better option.</p><h3>What headlamps do the military use?</h3><p>Although some units may issue headlamps, most service members buy their own for use in the field. Headlamps designed for camping are the most popular because they’re durable, long-lasting, and can be easily switched from white light to other colors like red and green.</p><h3>Why do some headlamps have different color lenses?</h3><p>White lights are by far the most common because they produce true-to-life colors. Other hues––usually red or green––are used to preserve our night vision. They also don’t carry as far, which is more discreet in a tactical environment.</p>"
camping gear,"<h2>FAQs on camping gear</h2><p>[Length: up to 50 words per FAQ.] </p><h3>Should I buy a two- or three-person tent for my partner and me?</h3><p>It depends on whether that extra room is worth carrying extra weight. Typically, I recommend going with a larger two-person tent.</p><h3>Aren’t mummy bags tight and uncomfortable to sleep in?</h3><p>They can be if you get one that’s too tight a fit. It’s important to test the sleeping bag you purchase before you take it to the field. </p><h3>Do I need to filter/treat the water? I hear it’s safe to drink out of the river/lake.</h3><p>Yes. I recommend filtering or treating all water that doesn’t come from a potable tap. In some countries, I recommend filtering or treating the tap water as well.</p><h3>Should I get the MSR Whisperlite or Dragonfly stove?</h3><p>Neither. I recommend the JetBoil family of stoves.</p><h3>Can I just buy a smaller backpack and strap more to the outside if I need to?</h3><p>You can, but everything strapped to the outside of your pack is more likely to detach and get lost. If you are climbing in vertical terrain, you’ll want to keep your gear in your pack to avoid dropping it on other people and to keep the weight closer to your center of gravity.</p><h3>Should I take packaged or real food?</h3><p>I prefer taking as much real food into the backcountry as possible, but watch the weight because it adds up fast. I typically carry real food for the first few days and then shift to dehydrated meals as the trip goes on. </p><h3>Is it worth the weight to take hiking poles?</h3><p>Hell yes. Trekking poles are worth their weight in gold when traveling over uneven terrain as they provide additional balance and keep you from busting your ass while wearing a heavy pack. They can also help prevent you from injury, serve as poles for setting up a tarp, or even as splints for immobilizing injured arms and legs.   </p><h3>Should I buy pots for cooking over an open fire or cooking on a stove?</h3><p>More pots equals more weight carried. If you’re car camping, sure. Go ahead. When backpacking, I prefer integrated stove-pot combos like the JetBoil.</p><h3>Pillow or no pillow?</h3><p>Always. An inflatable pillow weighs next to nothing and provides additional comfort to help you get a better night’s sleep.</p><h3>Should I pack a warm jacket?</h3><p>Yes. You should always pack an insulating layer — preferably one made from synthetic materials that will continue to insulate when damp. You should carry it every time you venture into the backcountry no matter the season. You should carry it in case you need it, or in case you come across an injured person who is at risk of a cold injury. Always take a warming layer.</p>"
swimming goggles,"<h2>FAQs on swimming goggles</h2><h3>How do you keep swimming goggles from fogging?</h3><p>Swimming goggles, safety glasses, and any other form of eye protection that doesn’t allow for airflow will be susceptible to fog. Some goggles will feature a proprietary anti-fog coating, but I have never found these to be very effective. Instead, using a good anti-fog compound such as Cat Crap has worked for me in the past.</p><h3>How do you clean swimming goggles?</h3><p>After every use, you should rinse your goggles in fresh water, which will prevent the chlorine from degrading the coating on your goggles, making the rubber brittle, and leaving residue on your goggle. Doing this will prolong the lifespan of your goggles.</p><h3>Can I wear swimming goggles after LASIK?</h3><p>Once fully healed from LASIK, there should be no issue with swimming with goggles. However, consult your optometrist with this question, as we don’t have any doctors on staff that I know of.</p><h3>How do you remove scratches from swim goggles?</h3><p>Depending on the severity of the scratches, and whether or not you have a mirrored coating on your goggles, you may be able to use a compound like Polywatch to buff out some scratches. However, this may not make the goggles as clear as they were before.</p><h3>How do you adjust swimming goggles?</h3><p>Your goggles should be snug, but not overly tight, and should stay on even when diving into the water, pushing off of the wall of the pool, or in heavy surf when in open water. For competitive swimmers, wearing your goggles underneath a swim cap may help with maintaining fit, and other swimmers may find it helpful to change out the nosepiece of their goggles.</p><h3>Can I wear contacts with swimming goggles?</h3><p>You can, however, many swimmers who require corrective lenses instead prefer to wear prescription swim goggles to avoid the possibility of chlorine infiltration under their contacts, which could cause far worse irritation than against the naked eye. </p><h3>How do you assemble swimming goggles?</h3><p>This mostly applies to Swedish swimming goggles, since most swimming goggles require little to no set up. Swedish goggles need to be adjusted for your eye width by lengthening or shortening the string that connects the goggles over the bridge of your nose, and then the rubber straps need to be adjusted. To properly size the straps, whether you use rubber straps or bungees, you’ll run the straps through the goggles once on each side, giving you an open end and a closed end. Tie off the open end or use a bungee gather, if using bungees, and adjust the tightness until the goggles feel secure on your head. Try the fit of the goggles underwater, and continue to adjust the length of the nose string and rubber straps until you achieve a secure fit, even in the most vigorous water conditions.</p>"

water purification tablets,"<h2>FAQs about water purification tablets</h2><h3>How long do water purification tablets last?</h3><p>They last until the expiration date, so check them. Most last a few years. </p><h3>What is the best chemical to purify water?</h3><p>Hands down, it’s chlorine dioxide because it nukes viruses, bacteria, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium.</p><h3>Does boiling water remove chlorine?</h3><p>Yes, if you boil it for 15 to 20 minutes.</p>"
camping chairs,"<h2>FAQs on camping chairs</h2><h3>Is a camping chair the same as a beach chair?</h3><p>No, beach chairs are typically lower to the ground and feature bars or wide pads to prevent the chair from sinking into the sand. You could use your camping chair on the beach if you want, though.</p><h3>Can camping chairs get wet?</h3><p>Yes, depending on the type of material. However, it could impact the durability and longevity of your camping chair, not to mention make your butt soggy.</p><h3>Do weight limits on camping chairs matter?</h3><p>Absolutely! At least for big guys like me. </p><h3>Do I need a camping chair? </h3><p>Not necessarily. If you can sit on a rock, a stump, or the ground for hours at a time without aches, pains, or losing circulation, then go right ahead. </p><h3>How much do camping chairs cost? </h3><p>Camping chairs are typically priced around $30-60. Deal surfers can probably find chairs under $30, but premium chairs can cost $100 or more. </p><h3>How do I wash my camping chair? </h3><p>Start by shaking off any loose dirt. Then use some soap, water, and a coarse bristled brush to target any tough stains. Set it out to air dry before stowing it away. </p>"
camping hammocks,"<h2>FAQs on camping hammocks</h2><h3>Are hammocks good for side-sleepers?</h3><p>Yes, hammocks can be just as good for side-sleepers as they are for those that sleep on their backs. Consider sleeping at a diagonal and give your hammock 30 degrees of slack at each end, or get a hammock with a flat, fixed frame.</p><h3>How do I choose a hammock?</h3><p>Before picking out a hammock, first identify what features matter to you and what you will be using the hammock for, whether that be backpacking, car camping, or lounging in a park — and then go from there.</p><h3>Are hammocks bad for your back?</h3><p>As long as you set your hammock up right, sleeping this way can actually provide more support for your back than sleeping in a bed, where you toss and turn throughout the night.</p>"
chronograph watches,"<h2>FAQs about chronograph watches</h2><h3>What is a chronograph watch?</h3><p>A chronograph watch is essentially a wrist-mounted stopwatch that measures, at the very least, seconds. It will usually feature a start and stop pusher, as well as a reset pusher. More sophisticated chronographs will feature the ability to track split times, and some may feature specialized bezels to measure units over time.</p><h3>What is the difference between a chronograph and a chronometer?</h3><p>The question of chronograph vs. chronometer is the difference between the stopwatch complication that is a chronograph, and a watch being rated minus four to plus six seconds per day.</p><h3>Why do chronograph watches cost so much?</h3><p>Chronographs are more complicated and require more effort to make them reliable and accurate. Due to this, they always cost more than equivalent quality watches that are less complex.</p><h3>How long do chronograph watches last?</h3><p>Chronograph watches will burn through their spring power reserve or battery at a faster rate than their conventional watch counterparts, and experience more parts wear over time. Don’t leave the chronograph running, and get your watch serviced every three to seven years.</p>"
first aid kits,"<h2>FAQs on first aid kids</h2><h3>Why do I need a first aid kit.</h3><p>People do stupid things; ergo, you need a first aid kit. Oh yeah, and accidents can happen at the most random times. Like the time I sliced myself with my Buck Cadet. While opening a package. For a plastic pie server. (How did I get this job again?)</p><h3>What should I look for in a first aid kit</h3><p>A first aid kit’s contents will vary widely from kit to kit, but the chances are if you don’t know what something is or how/when to use it, then you probably shouldn’t get it.</p><h3>Where should I keep a first aid kit?</h3><p>Wherever you think you’ll need one. In your glove box, under your sink … just keep it easily accessible. Personally, I carry one with me everywhere I go, but then again, I’m weird like that.</p><h3>Do first aid kits expire?</h3><p>No, but some components may need to be replaced from time to time. Most over-the-counter medications never expire; however, they will slowly lose potency over the years. Bandages and dressings require dry, sealed packages to maintain their sterile integrity. Gel packets, alcohol wipes, and similar supplies will eventually dry out over time and need to be replaced every so often.</p><h3>Are there any first aid kit regulations I should be aware of?</h3><p>To my knowledge, there are no regulations on first aid kits. That said, there are plenty of laws and other restrictions surrounding the administration of first aid. The most significant are Good Samaritan laws and laws restricting who can administer medications in an emergency.</p><h3>What should a first aid kit include for patching?</h3><p>This will vary from kit to kit depending on a given first aid kit’s intended purpose. As of late 2021, common OSHA-compliant kits must include (at minimum): a box of adhesive bandages, multiple gauze pads (at least 4 by 4-inches), two large gauze pads (at least 8 x 10 inches), and one roller gauze bandage (at least 2 inches wide).</p><h3>Can I take a first aid kit on a plane?</h3><p>Absolutely. Unless you plan to pack along an emergency knife, carrying a first aid kit onto a plane shouldn’t cause any issues. The only potential issue you might run into is if you include trauma shears in your kit (a rare add-on). I’ve only taken trauma shears through TSA a handful of times, but I haven’t had any issues. Your mileage may vary.</p><h3>How much does a first aid kit weight?</h3><p>In general, first aid kits tend to weigh in somewhere between one and three pounds. That said, each kit is different, and I’ve seen kits above and below those numbers.</p><h3>Do I need to consult a physician or medical professional to approve first aid supplies at my business?</h3><p>Workplace first aid supplies are dictated by OSHA standards, and all OSHA-mandated first aid equipment can be purchased without restriction at Amazon, CVS, Walmart, etc. Of course, none of your supplies are any good if no one knows how to use them. Get yourself and your staff first aid certified.</p><h3>Should first aid kits be regularly inspected to ensure contents are complete and up to date</h3><p>Absolutely. During my time as a lifeguard and assistant pool manager, my staff and I regularly checked the status of our first aid kits.</p><h3>Can over-the-counter medicines be put in first aid kits?</h3><p>Yes, although which over-the-counter medications a first aid kit includes will depend somewhat on its intended use case(s). First aid kits frequently include acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin), a topical antiseptic, and a topical antibiotic. They may also include sugar/glucose tablets, burn cream, or sting relief wipes.</p>"
crossfit shoes for women,"<h2>FAQs about women’s CrossFit shoes</h2><h3>What makes CrossFit shoes different from other shoes?</h3><p>There’s a whole bunch of reasons why veterans love CrossFit, one of them being the versatility of the workouts. Good female CrossFit shoes are also all about versatility. We need a shoe that can support us from the erg to squats to the speed rope. CrossFit shoes are unique in that they’re multi-discipline shoes. They’re a hybrid of your lifting shoes and your pillowy running shoes.</p><h3>Can I use CrossFit shoes for running?</h3><p>Yes, you can wear your CrossFit shoes for running. A well-designed cross-training shoe should take you through a lifting, running, or calisthenics workout, among other physical activities. But if you’re exclusively running, you’re likely to fare better with a shoe specifically built for running. Check out our picks for the best running shoes for women.</p><h3>Can you wear CrossFit shoes outside?</h3><p>Sure, you can wear your CrossFit shoes outside. Will wearing them outside add to the wear and tear? Yes. Will your shoes likely get dirtier by wearing them outside? Also yes. But ultimately, how and where you want to sport your shoes is up to you.</p>"
camping tables,"<h2>FAQs about camping tables</h2><h3>Are camping tables necessary?</h3><p>No, but neither are sleeping pads, and both make camping a lot more enjoyable.</p><h3>How much weight can a camping table hold?</h3><p>That varies, but you should always check the manufacturer’s recommended weight limit to be safe. Remember that the ground conditions underneath your table will factor into the weight limit, too.</p><h3>How do you set up a camping table?</h3><p>That varies from table to table, but most are designed to be easily set up and taken down by one person.</p><h3>Where can I buy a camping table?</h3><p>There are lots of stores where you can hunt for a parking space, fight for the attention of understaffed salespeople, and find out that the table you want isn’t in stock after all. If it were me, I’d just click one of the links in this story and have it sent to my doorstep.</p>"
down jackets,"<h2>FAQs on down jackets</h2><h3>Which down jacket is the warmest?</h3><p>Typically, the ones with the most down by weight and the highest fill power down in them are the warmest. </p><h3>Is 800 fill power down warmer than 600?</h3><p>Ounce for ounce, 800 fill down is warmer than 600 fill down, provided that the same amount of down by weight is used. Note that fill power is a measure of the down’s quality (loft), but this number alone won’t tell you how warm a jacket is. You’ll also need to take into account how many ounces of down are stitched into the jacket.</p><h3>Are down jackets good for hiking?</h3><p>Absolutely. Down jackets provide exceptional warmth per ounce and great compressibility. </p>"
binoculars under 100,"<h2>FAQs about binoculars</h2><h3>How much do affordable binoculars cost?</h3><p>All the products listed plus many more can be had for less than three figures. Many robust, high-quality products from big brands occupy the $80 to $99 range, with most mid-grade examples sitting between $60 and $70. Our Best Value-winning Carson ScoutPlus comes in at a friendly $40.</p><h3>Can I wear my eyeglasses with binoculars?</h3><p>Definitely, but wearing eyeglasses may inhibit your view depending on the eye relief. Find a product that allows you to get a clear look at the captured image without placing your face too far or smashing it against your glasses. Some have adjustable eyecups to fit perfectly with you</p><h3>How do I select the appropriate binoculars for my hobbies?</h3><p>Admittedly, most binoculars can function as general-use, jack-of-all-trades products, but particular preferences in sizing and optics can improve their performance in certain fields. Intense magnification is great for stargazing, while massive lenses create bright, crisp images for dim environments or wildlife observation. Hunters and hikers will benefit from compact, durable, waterproof sight pieces.</p>"
barbells,"<h2>FAQs on barbells</h2><h3>What does tensile strength mean in barbells?</h3><p>Tensile strength is the amount of pressure the material of the bar can handle before breaking. It’s typically represented in pounds per square inch (PSI) and directly relates to the maximum load the bar is capable of. </p><h3>Does whip matter in a barbell?</h3><p>Yes, depending on the type of lifting you’re doing. For most weightlifting and strength training, whip is irrelevant and unnecessary. For Olympic weightlifting or stabilizer training, it is important to have as it can reduce the amount of shock on the body during the exercises. </p><h3>How much does a barbell weigh?</h3><p>The weight of the barbell varies depending on design and material. Traditional straight bars weigh 45 pounds but are offered at 25 and 35 pounds as well for beginners. Trap/hex bars can be heavier, while EZ curl bars will be lighter. </p><h3>Is tensile strength or yield strength more important?</h3><p>Yield strength is more important unless you can afford to drop several Benjamins every time you work out. Yield strength is the amount of weight the bar can hold before bending and deforming. It’s not recommended to attempt lifts with a deformed bar. </p>"
gas masks,"<h2>FAQs about gas masks</h2><h3>What gas mask do the Navy SEALs use?</h3><p>Most U.S. forces, including the Navy SEALs, generally use the Avon M50, but some have been spotted using the Ops-Core SOTR for certain cases. </p><h3>Is it legal to own a gas mask?</h3><p>In many states, there are laws that prohibit the wearing of masks with the intent to conceal one’s identity. While gas masks do cover one’s face, it’s difficult to prove that someone wore a gas mask specifically to conceal their identity. A police officer may attempt to arrest you and charge you under these laws, but they often require intent to conceal, as in the case with Virginia. Know your local laws, and consult with an attorney.</p><h3>Who invented gas masks?</h3><p>Garrett Morgan, a Black scientist and inventor who was the son of a Confederate general and an enslaved woman, patented the first practical gas mask in 1914. These aided rescue workers and soldiers almost immediately, especially with the onset of World War I. He invented it due to observing how rescue workers were not able to enter the Triangle Shirtwaist company as it burned down in 1911, due to the noxious fumes, which killed 77 percent of the people who died that day. His invention was the first respirator meant to draw fresh air from below the smoke and carbon monoxide using a hose that dragged on the ground, and filter it through a wet sponge to remove smoke particles. His invention was then further developed by John Scott Haldane and others during World War I to defeat poison gas used by the Germans, who added things like chemical filters to neutralize low levels of chlorine and mustard gas.</p><h3>Were gas masks used in World War II?</h3><p>Yes, gas masks were used during World War II, but not as commonly as in World War I. Open gas attacks were relatively rare, mostly performed by the Imperial Japanese against Chinese citizens and troops. The rarity of gas attacks on the Western Front was largely due to the Nazis’ blitzkrieg strategy requiring them to move too fast to wait for gas clouds to clear. Additionally, Hitler knew that his opponent, Winston Churchill, had stated openly that if the Nazis used gas, the British would respond in kind, stating “In the event of the Germans using gas on the Russians…We shall retaliate by drenching the German cities with gas on the largest possible scale.” Churchill also felt that the allies should be less squeamish in using chemical and biological weapons, which was a very controversial thing to say, and which divided his own advisors. Finally, the German logistics system was dependent upon horse-drawn carriages, and they had not developed gas masks for horses that would allow the animals to breathe enough to draw a carriage, and the German scientific development was not advanced enough to provide gasses that would defeat common allied gas masks.</p>"
backpacking tents,"<h2>FAQs of backpacking tents</h2><h3>How heavy should a tent be for backpacking?</h3><p>What? Are you a masochist? It shouldn’t be heavy at all. Look to keep weights below four pounds lighter if you can.</p><h3>What’s the difference between a camping tent and a backpacking tent?</h3><p>Camping tents are generally large and sleep four or more people. They’re usually filled with screaming kids and are placed in KOA parks next to a hundred other tents filled with more screaming kids and a few noisy drunks. In short, they are a misery. Backpacking tents, on the other hand, are small, lightweight, and sleep one to three people. They are the tents you use when you want to get far into the woods and escape all the idiots.</p><h3>Should I get a single- or double-walled tent?</h3><p>It depends. Cold and dry environments? Go with the single. Wet and hot? Go with the double.</p>"
outdoor gear walmart,"<h2>FAQs about backcountry gear</h2><h3>How did you get started in backpacking?</h3><p>My dad got me into Boy Scouts and camping and we used a lot of Coleman products like sleeping bags, coolers, and tents.</p><h3>Why is high-end backpacking gear so expensive?</h3><p>High-end gear is expensive due to the research and development that goes into developing the lightest and strongest materials for the task. Let’s face it, carrying a heavy pack sucks. So, typically, the lighter the gear, the more it costs.</p><h3>Do you know of any good video resources to help me decide what gear to buy and how to use it? </h3><p>I’m a huge fan of Jessica Mills and her Homemade Wonderlist YouTube channel. She’s an amazing woman who thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail on a budget, and later the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails. She’s a wealth of knowledge.  </p>"
adjustable dumbbells,"<h2>FAQs on adjustable dumbbells</h2><h3>What is the difference between adjustable dumbbells versus fixed dumbbells?</h3><p>With fixed dumbbells, you’ll need to purchase an individual (or set) of dumbbells for each desired weight. With adjustable dumbbells, one set can replace the need for multiple sets.</p><h3>Can men and women use adjustable dumbbells?</h3><p>Yes. There are no gender designations for adjustable dumbbells.</p><h3>Does the weight on each dumbbell have to be equal?</h3><p>In most cases, the weight does not need to be equal on each end of the dumbbell in order to remove it from its base. However, the user will definitely notice an unbalanced weight during exercises.</p>"
handheld gps,"<h2>FAQs about handheld GPS</h2><h3>How much does a handheld GPS cost?</h3><p>Garmin is the brand to have in the GPS world, and its most affordable unit costs $110. Handheld GPS prices go up to $800 for the Montana 750i or GPSMAP 276Cx.</p><h3>Which handheld GPS is the most accurate?</h3><p>All of the handheld GPS devices on this list are very accurate. What varies is the source of that positional information, there are other satellite networks besides GPS. The Garmin GPSMAP 65s can communicate with four satellite networks, which is the most of any product here and should provide the broadest coverage. </p><h3>What is the easiest handheld GPS to use?</h3><p>The easiest handheld GPS for beginners is probably the phone you use every day. Standard navigational tools like Google Maps, Apple Maps, and Maps.me are fine for everyday use but they aren’t great outside city limits. If you want to experiment with handheld GPS on a budget, check out the Gaia GPS app. </p>"
dry bags,"<h2>FAQs about dry bags</h2><h3>What is a dry bag used for?</h3><p>Dry bags are used as a layer of waterproof protection for clothing and sensitive equipment. </p><h3>What size dry bag should I buy?</h3><p>This will vary from person to person and activity to activity, but it’s nice to have several small dry bags. This approach allows you to keep gear organized and easy to pack.</p><h3>Are dry bags fully waterproof?</h3><p>The good ones are.</p>"
camping coffee makers,"<h2>FAQs about camping coffee makers</h2><h3>What kind of coffee do you use in a camping percolator?</h3><p>You’re better off using a coarse grind if your percolator is using an integrated metal filter, as this will result in fewer grounds sneaking into the coffee. If your percolator is high-quality and also uses a paper filter, you can get away with finer grinds.</p><h3>What is better: French press or percolator?</h3><p>This truly is a matter of your tastes. Personally, I find the French press the better option because I can better control how long the coffee steeps and, therefore, the strength and bitterness of the brew. But string percolator coffee has its place. </p><h3>Are camping coffee makers worth it?</h3><p>If you love coffee, they’re not only worth it, but they’re indispensable. The great thing is that there are some very inexpensive and simple coffee makers out there that make great coffee, as well as more costly premium options if you’re a true snob.</p>"
agility ladders,"<h2>FAQs about agility ladders</h2><h3>How much do agility ladders cost?</h3><p>Relative to many pieces of workout equipment, agility ladders are reasonably inexpensive, save for a few unique designs. Many agility ladder sets sticker between $25 and $60 depending on their content, while individual ladders can sticker for $20 or less. Our Best Value winner in its shortest length rings in at $10, while the rubber SPRI mat tips the scale at $69. Our Best Overall, GHB Speed Ladder, splits the difference at $30. </p><h3>What are agility ladders used for?</h3><p>Agility ladders can serve multiple purposes based on the user. They’re generally used as part of a trick cardio routine to hone a person’s motor functions, speed, and balance as they navigate their way through the rungs. They’re commonplace in helping football or soccer players practice footwork via the many agility ladder drills available.</p><h3>How effective are agility ladders?</h3><p>Paired with effective agility ladder drills, they’re arguably highly effective in training an athlete’s muscle memory and skill or repairing a physical therapy patient’s movement. There’s been a study among youth athletes that suggest otherwise, but most sources can attest to their usefulness. Side benefits also include the strengthening of joints and ligaments.</p>"
hiking daypacks,"<h2>FAQs about hiking daypacks</h2><h3>What should I look for when buying a hiking daypack?</h3><p>Your priority is to decide on an appropriate capacity for your daypack — anything over 25 liters will tempt you to carry far too much gear for a simple dayhike. Beyond that, look for the features (design, pockets, attachment points) that best fit your use case, recognizing that features generally equate to added weight. </p><h3>What is the difference between a backpack and a daypack?</h3><p>The main difference is primarily volume, with daypacks topping out at around 35 liters and backpacks going up to 90 liters or more. Backpacks are designed for multi-day or multi-night excursions and have additional features for carrying or attaching gear that isn’t necessary for day-hiking (e.g., bear canisters).</p><h3>What should be in a daypack for hiking?</h3><p>Water sufficient for your use with filtration and purification capabilities in case of unexpected delays, food as desired, extra clothing, rain gear if appropriate, map, compass, and either the “10 Essentials” or the “10 C’s of Survivability” (parts 1 and 2), depending on your experience in the backcountry and knowledge of the area.</p>"
camping knives,"<h2>FAQs on camping knives</h2><h3>How sharp should a camping knife be?</h3><p>Sharp is sharp — either your knife is dull, or it’s not. That said, typically you won’t need as refined of an edge as you would on, say, a straight razor. For most camping knives, a 25 to 30-degree edge is strong enough to not need much maintenance in the field, while remaining acute enough for most tasks. Knives used for fileting and similar tasks will be more acute, while those used instead of proper hatchets or machetes will benefit from broader edges.</p><h3>Can you have a knife for camping?</h3><p>That is what the title of this article implies, yes. It is worth noting, however, that local restrictions apply, so make sure to be informed before you pack up to head out. KnifeUp.com is a fantastic source for up-to-date information.</p><h3>What is a knife used for during camping?</h3><p>If your answer is “everything,” you’re on the right track. Foraging, fishing, gutting, cooking, starting a fire, building shelter — the list goes on and on, and is only limited by your imagination.</p>"
trail running shoes,"<h2>FAQs on trail running shoes</h2><h3>Do you need different shoes for trail running?</h3><p>As with most workout gear, the answer is “it depends.” If you plan on long distances (over 10 miles), you probably want to look at the trail runners with more cushion and deep lugs (assuming the trails are technical).</p><h3>What makes trail running shoes different from other running shoes?</h3><p>The typical trail runner has thicker cushioning and more rigidity throughout than a regular road shoe. More importantly, it has a tough outsole with lugs on the bottom to provide stability on the varied surfaces you’ll find on trails. To help deal with wet and muddy conditions, some trail runners are waterproof, while others use breathable meshes and various types of drainage to help the shoe dry quickly and to help avoid blisters.</p><h3>Is it OK to use trail running shoes on the road?</h3><p>Usually, yes. However, I don’t like to. The lugs on trail runners are designed to help navigate rocks and roots and to sink into softer trails. Deep lugs feel weird when running on paved surfaces, and wear out faster than they’re supposed to. Having said that, there are crossover/hybrid shoes with shorter lugs and more flexibility for multi-surface running.</p><h3>What trail running shoes should I use to run in mud?</h3><p>Shoes with large (5-6mm) lugs and aggressive lug patterns provide ideal stability and confidence while running on muddy surfaces. Waterproof shoes are probably best, although they don’t breathe as well, but most shoes are designed to at least drain water as you run.  </p><h3>What’s the most cushioned trail running shoe?</h3><p>Shoes made for ultra or marathon running tend to pack in the most cushioning. Hoka One One went all in on this maximum cushioning, and the Speedgoat 4 is one of the most cushioned you’ll find.</p><h3>Should I wear gaiters with trail running shoes?</h3><p>This depends on the kind of trails you’re running and the distance. Gaiters help to keep debris and moisture from getting into your shoes, so if you’re running long distances on muddy, snowy, or sandy trails, they may be helpful. But if you’re running relatively short distances, like three to five miles, they may be more trouble than they’re worth.</p><h3>Why are trail running shoes so expensive?</h3><p>Regular running shoes are expensive enough as it is, right? Then why are trail runners even more so? It has to do with the increased durability needed in the shoe’s upper, midsole, cushioning, and outsole. The materials that make up the shoes have to be sturdy enough to provide support and absorb impact while also being breathable and somewhat flexible. They also need to be able to last despite being literally run into the ground, so then you can understand how the price of these shoes climbs pretty fast.</p><h3>Can I wear trail running shoes for hiking?</h3><p>Absolutely. In fact, many serious hikers do. Check out this article from 2019, Top Footwear of the Appalachian Trail. Over 75 percent of the 365 Appalachian trail hikers that participated in the article survey that year wore trail runners at least part of the time. Be sure to break them in the same way as new boots, though, or you’ll wind up with blisters and hot spots. Also, if you have ankle stability issues, you may want to stick with traditional hiking boots.</p><h3>Can I wear trail shoes for walking?</h3><p>Yes, but the hybrid/crossover trail runners, like the Brooks Caldera 5 and Divide 2, will probably perform the best on paved surfaces.</p>"
camping food,"<h2>FAQs on camping food</h2><h3>What food should I bring camping?</h3><p>Bring food that you’ll want to eat that’s also lightweight, shelf-stable, calorie-dense, and simple to prepare.</p><h3>How do I keep food cold while camping?</h3><p>If you are car camping, bring a cooler with ice. You can use dry ice if you can find it, but be careful when handling it. </p><h3>How do I pack food for camping?</h3><p>Whether car camping or backpacking, it’s important to have a system of organization so that you aren’t a walking yard sale. For car camping, this usually involves coolers and boxes. When backpacking, I organize my food by meal in Ziploc bags and label them with a sharpie marker. I then put all of my food into a dry bag that has a few external loops which enables it to double as my bear bag (when I hang it in a tree overnight).</p><h3>How do I prepare food for camping?</h3><p>My favorite way is to boil water, pour it into a dehydrated meal bag, and chill. Simple and tasty. </p><h3>How do I keep food away from bears while camping?</h3><p>If you have trees available, hang your food in a bear bag. If not, take along a bear canister.</p>"
timex watches,"<h2>FAQs about Timex watches</h2><h3>Is Timex a good quality watch?</h3><p>It depends. Timex is a budget brand at heart, and you get what you pay for, with some quality control issues being noted by owners. While Timex does work to fix these issues and improve user experience, in some instances it would make sense to save your money for a more pricey brand.</p><h3>Where are Timex watches made?</h3><p>Timex watches are designed in Milan, Italy. Manufacturing is mostly done in Asia, with the exception of the American Documents collection. The American Documents collection is assembled in Waterbury, Connecticut using American-sourced parts, minus the Swiss-quartz movement.</p><h3>What brands does Timex own?</h3><p>Timex’s parent company, Timex Group B.V., makes watches for several other companies including Versace, Salvatore Ferrogamo, Nautica, and several others.</p><h3>How long do Timex watches last?</h3><p>Timex watches, with proper care, tend to last five to 10 years. However, maintenance such as battery swaps for the quartz movement watches and tune-ups for the mechanicals will increase the lifespan of these timepieces.</p>"
backpacking water filters,"<h2>FAQs on backpacking water filters</h2><h3>What’s the difference between a purifier and a filtration system?</h3><p>Purifiers tend to nuke all pathogens to include viruses, while filtration systems generally remove all bacteria and protozoa larger than 0.1 microns, but not viruses.</p><h3>Is a gravity or squeeze filter better?</h3><p>It depends. Do you like to take a break while filtering water? Use a gravity system. If you like to get your water and go, use a squeeze system.</p><h3>Why do I need to protect hollow tube filter cartridges from freezing?</h3><p>When water freezes, it expands and can damage the tubes. When the tubes get damaged, they don’t filter well and could let pathogens get through. When pathogens get through, you get the shits or worse.</p>"
camping grills,"<h2>FAQs on camping grills</h2><h3>Are camping grills safe?</h3><p>Generally speaking, yes. As long as you use your camping grill correctly, it should be safe.</p><h3>Can you grill on a camping stove?</h3><p>You can, and you should. It’s delicious.</p><h3>Is camping gas the same thing as propane?</h3><p>Yes. When you see a camping grill attached to a bottle of some sort, it’s burning propane. Some grills burn natural gas, but they need to be hooked up to an established gas line like the one at your house.</p><h3>Are camping grills allowed at campsites and dispersed camping areas?</h3><p>You bet they are! Most camping locations actually require some kind of grill or camp stove because they present less of a fire risk. Always check the rules for your campsite before you leave home to make sure you have the appropriate gear.</p>"
noise canceling headphones,"<h2>FAQs about noise-canceling headphones</h2><h3>Are there headphones that block all sound?</h3><p>No headphones are going to block all sound, but the best noise-canceling headphones do a pretty amazing job. You’ll be able to enjoy a movie or music at a comfortable volume even if there’s a ruckus going on all around you.</p><h3>Do noise-canceling headphones reduce sound quality?</h3><p>In a quiet room, high-end traditional headphones have an edge. In the real world, the best noise-canceling headphones improve sound quality by cleaning up the sound waves that enter your ear. When your audio doesn’t have to compete with ambient noise, it comes through in much higher quality.</p><h3>What’s the difference between noise canceling and active noise canceling?</h3><p>These terms refer to the same thing: headphones that use a microphone and chip to create soundwaves that are precisely opposite of those around you, leaving you with only the sound coming from your device. Without active noise canceling, headphones are just isolating your ears from ambient noise with a physical barrier.</p><h3>Are noise-canceling headphones worth it?</h3><p>If you listen to any kind of audio in a busy area, noise-canceling headphones are absolutely worth it.</p>"
dumbbell sets,"<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About: dumbbell sets</h2><h3>How do I use a dumbbell set?</h3><p>Start with the bar in the middle position and hold it there for your starting position. Squat down to the bottom of your squatting range, keeping your upper arms close to your sides and your elbows slightly bent.</p><h3>What is the best time to work out with dumbbells?</h3><p>Dumbbell workouts can be done at any time of day, but most people prefer to avoid using them during times when they could be sleeping or watching TV. If you're training for a specific event (like a marathon), then stick to a pre-determined schedule, like morning workout or evening workout. Otherwise, just go with whatever works best for you. The important thing is to keep consistent.</p><h3>How many different types of dumbbells should I have in my home gym?</h3><p>A good rule of thumb is to have at least two different weights for each major muscle group you train. This will allow you to perform more exercises than if you were using just one weight.</p><h3>Is it better to use lighter or heavier dumbbells?</h3><p>It's generally best to start out with light dumbbells and then progress to heavier ones over time. If you're new to lifting weights, you shouldn't be working with heavy weights right away. Instead, focus on building strength first before adding additional pounds.</p><h3>Should I buy a set of dumbbells or get individual weights?</h3><p>Buying a set of dumbbells is often cheaper than buying individual weights. However, it's important to remember that you won't necessarily know how much weight you'll end up needing until you've been training for awhile. In this case, getting individual weights would likely save you money in the long run.</p><h3>Can I use dumbbells instead of barbells?</h3><p>Dumbbells aren't designed to replace barbells. They're simply another option for performing certain exercises. Barbells are still the most popular type of exercise equipment because they provide greater stability during lifts.</p><h3>Where can I find free dumbbells?</h3><p>You can find free dumbbells at your local YMCA or community center. Many gyms offer discounted rates for memberships, so check around to see what deals are available.</p>"
camo pants,"<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About: camouflage pants</h2><h3>What is the difference between tactical and utility camo?</h3><p>Tactical camos are designed to conceal you from the enemy while allowing you to see clearly enough to engage targets effectively. They tend to be light in color, with a high percentage of reflective material, and often include a chin strap for added concealment.</p><h3>How much does camo cost?</h3><p>Camo pants can cost anywhere from $30 to $50 for basic versions, to over $100 for premium fabrics and features like articulated knees and reinforced stitching. The price will vary depending on the fabric used, the number of pockets, and any additional features such as knee darts or gussets that may be included. Premium fabrics like 3M Thinsulate and Dri-Tek will cost more than regular camo but will last longer due to their higher quality materials and construction. Also, keep in mind that you'll need to pay for shipping if you want your gear to arrive by Christmas, so plan accordingly.</p><h3>What do military camo patterns look like?</h3><p>The United States Military uses several different camouflage patterns, including the woodland green/brownish Olive Drab 4, desert tan/brownish Tan, and mountain green/grayish Gray Mountain 81. These colors are then broken down into either ""base"" or ""operational"" variants, which are basically just lighter and darker shades of the same thing. For example, the base Olive Drab 4 is a little less brownish and a little more greenish, while the Operational Olive Drab 4 is a little more brownish and a little less greenish. The main differences between the two are subtle variations in hue and saturation, and the addition of small amounts of red and yellow to the base pattern to make</p><h3>Can I use my camo pants for hunting?</h3><p>Yes, you can use your camo pants for hunting, but you'll want to make sure you're using the right pattern for the type of hunting you're doing. If you're hunting in an area with a lot of trees, you'll want to use a woodland camo pattern. If you're hunting in an area with a lot of sand, you'll want to use a desert camo pattern. And if you're hunting in an area with a lot of rocks, you'll want to use a mountain camo pattern. Each pattern is designed to help you blend in with a specific type of environment, so using the wrong pattern can actually make you more visible, not less. That being said, if you're just getting started in hunting, you might want to buy a pair of pants in each of the three most common patterns so you're prepared for anything.</p><h3>What are the best camo patterns for urban environments?</h3><p>The best camo patterns for urban environments are those that use a lot of straight lines and geometric shapes. These patterns are designed to help you blend in with the man-made environment around you, and they're often called ""urban camo"" or ""urban digital camo."" The most popular urban camo patterns are the Multicam and the A-TACS AU, but there are many other patterns to choose from. Just remember that the more straight lines and geometric shapes in a pattern, the more it will stand out in nature, so if you're planning on spending any time in the woods, you might want to stick with a more traditional camo pattern.</p>"
edc knife,"<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About: Edc knives</h2><h3>How thick should an EDC knife be?</h3><p>The thickness of an EDC knife will vary depending on what tasks it's designed for. For general utility tasks, we recommend something in the range of 3 to 4 inches. For more precise work, like skinning animals or opening packages, go with something thicker like 5 inches or more. If you plan to carry it on a belt loop, go with something at least 5 inches thick to avoid scratching or damaging your pants. If you plan to wear it with a sheath, make sure you get something with a blade length that matches your preferred style of carry (I personally prefer a thumb break over a thumb stud).</p><h3>How is it different from other folding knives?</h3><p>First off, EDC stands for everyday carry. It typically refers to gear that's carried consistently for every day use, as opposed to items that are only used for specific tasks or situations. An EDC knife is a knife that's designed for general utility use, as opposed to a knife that's designed for a specific task like skinning an animal or opening a package. An EDC knife should be lightweight, durable, and comfortable to carry.</p><h3>What is the best type of steel for an EDC knife?</h3><p>There are a lot of different types of steels out there, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. For an EDC knife, we recommend something in the middle of the road like 8Cr13MoV or AUS-8. These steels are tough enough to handle everyday tasks, but they're also easy to sharpen. If you're looking for a little bit more edge retention, go with something like S30V or ELMAX. These steels will hold an edge longer, but they're also a bit more difficult to sharpen.</p><h3>What is the best type of blade for an EDC knife?</h3><p>The best type of blade for an EDC knife is a drop point blade. Drop point blades have a wide, curved cutting edge that's ideal for general utility tasks. The wide cutting edge provides plenty of room for slicing, while the curved profile makes it easy to control the blade when cutting through tough materials. If you're looking for a little bit more precision, go with a spear point or clip point blade. These blades have a narrower cutting edge and a sharper point, making them ideal for more precise tasks. However, they're also more difficult to control, so they're not ideal for general utility use.</p><h3>What is the best handle material for an EDC knife?</h3><p>The best handle material for an EDC knife is a lightweight, durable material like G10 or aluminum. These materials are strong enough to handle everyday tasks, but they're also lightweight and comfortable to carry. If you're looking for a little bit more style, go with a material like carbon fiber or titanium. These materials are more expensive, but they'll give your knife a unique look.</p><h3>What is the best way to carry an EDC knife?</h3><p>The best way to carry an EDC knife is in a sheath or a pouch. This will keep the knife from damaging your clothes or scratching your skin. If you're carrying the knife in a sheath, make sure you choose a sheath that's comfortable to wear and that has a secure closure. If you're carrying the knife in a pouch, make sure the pouch has a secure closure and that it's not too bulky.</p>"

cell phone boosters for rural areas,"<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About: Cell phone boosters</h2><h3>What is the difference between a cell phone booster and a cell phone repeater?</h3><p>A cell phone booster amplifies cellular signals to improve reception in an area with weak coverage or where there are multiple sources of interference. A repeater does the opposite, forwarding calls from your cell phone to another base station, effectively extending your range. The trade-off is that you'll use more battery power and incur more network traffic. If you're frequently dropping calls, it might be worth investing in a repeater instead.&nbsp;</p><h3>Can I use a cell phone booster to call 911?</h3><p>Yes, but keep in mind that you'll be using more battery power and generating more network traffic than normal, so you'll want to make sure you have enough battery life before heading out on a call.

If you don't see an improvement, your booster might not be working properly.</p><h3>How do I get good reception in my area?</h3><p>Cell phones use radio waves to transmit information between your device and other devices nearby. This process requires a strong enough signal so that you can hear and receive calls and text messages without interference. If you live in an area where the signals aren't strong enough, you'll have trouble receiving calls and texts.</p><h3>Is there anything I can do about poor reception?</h3><p>Yes! There are many things you can try to improve your reception. You could move closer to your service provider's tower, but this isn't always possible. Another option would be to purchase a portable cell phone booster.</p>"

If you plan to cook outdoors often, then a gas grill may be a better option for your needs. However, if you plan to cook indoors only occasionally, then a charcoal grill may be a better fit for your lifestyle.</p><h3>How long does charcoal last?</h3><p>Charcoal burns at a very high temperature, so it will burn down faster than other types of fuel, but it won't go out of style like an LP tank will. You can expect to get three to five hours of cooking time from a single bag of charcoal, depending on how hot your grill gets and what food you're grilling. After that, you'll want to replenish your fuel supply by purchasing another bag of charcoal or lightening the charcoal in your current grill with lighter fluid. This will extend the life of your grill by several years. As always, check the manufacturer's instructions for detailed usage guidelines.</p><h3>How many times can you use charcoal in a grill?</h3><p>But instead of tossing every piece of that barely-used charcoal every time you start the grill again, you can use those coals one more time. Even though they've been burned once, they'll reignite a second time.</p><h3>How long does a charcoal grill take to heat up?</h3><p>For best results, you need to get your barbecue to temperature before cooking. Heat up your barbecue for around 10-15 minutes with the lid on before putting anything on the cooking grates. If your charcoal barbecue is not hot enough: Make sure your lid vents are open fully.</p><h3>How do you clean a charcoal grill?</h3><p>Make grilling season easier on yourself and clean your grill at the start of each grilling session, not at the end. Start by lighting your coals and letting your grill heat up for about 10 minutes. This should heat the grates enough that any crusted-on food can be easily removed with a grill brush. After you clean the grates, oil them using a paper towel dipped in oil and held in tongs. When you're done cooking for the day, give the grates a good once-over with the grill brush, but don't worry about getting them spotlessly clean a thin layer of grease will actually help protect the grates from the elements and prevent rust from forming. Finally, make sure to empty your ashes, and keep that grill covered when not in use.</p>"

In the high alpine of a national park, for instance your odds are low, while if you are sharing a water source with livestock in a national forest, the odds increase considerably. I recommend always carrying one in your hiking backpack and treating all your water sources with it. If you are unsure as to whether you need a water purifier which will also remove viruses like rotovirus and norovirus, contact the land manager where you plan to travel for more information about the waterborne contaminants typically found there.</p></div>"
mosquito repellents,"<h2>FAQs on mosquito repellents</h2><h3>What smell keeps mosquitoes away?</h3><p>Mosquitos don't like certain smells, such as lavender, citronella, or eucalyptus. These smells deter mosquitoes because they produce chemicals that mosquitoes don't like namely linalool and geraniol.</p><h3>Do mosquitoes hate perfume?</h3><p>Fragrances, such as perfume, cologne, and scented lotions are a known attractant of mosquitoes. Floral scents are the biggest attraction for mosquitoes. It turns out those lady mosquitoes love a flowery fragrance. So when you're addressing the issue of body odor, be sure to avoid washing with fragranced body wash.</p><h3>What are the chemicals used in insect repellent?</h3><p>Insect repellent compounds used in textile finishes are either synthetic chemicals such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), picaridin (1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 2-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-methlypropylester) or permethrin, or natural products (essential oils) such as citronella, neem, lemon and eucalyptus.</p><h3>What is a natural insect repellent?</h3><p>Botanical repellents, which often have natural on the label, can include any number of plant-based chemicals. Some common ones are lemongrass, citronella, peppermint, geraniol, soybean, and rosemary.</p><h3>How effective are mosquito repellents?</h3><p>Mosquito repellents work by either disrupting the insects' sense of smell or mimicking their natural pheromones, which cause them to feel uncomfortable and agitated. The more disruptive the method, the more effective it is.</p><h3>Are there any side effects from using mosquito repellents?</h3><p>There are no known side effects from using a good quality repellent, but you should be aware that some repellents may contain DEET, which can have negative health consequences if ingested in large amounts. If you're pregnant or nursing, you should avoid all products containing DEET, as they could pose a risk to your baby. Also, if you have epilepsy, you should consult with a medical professional before using any repellent containing DEET, as seizures can be triggered by exposure to high temperatures and/or low humidity. Finally, if you have eczema, dermatitis, or other skin conditions, you should probably avoid repellents altogether, as they can worsen existing skin issues.</p><h3>Has anyone studied effects of long-term exposure to common insect repellents?</h3><p>Repellents are often used for a few days or weeks. However, various jobs and other conditions may result in daily use of a repellent for extended periods. In a few studies, animals were treated with common repellents every day for long periods of time. They sometimes had irritated skin. Symptoms were limited to skin irritation and did not include other systemic effects.</p><h3>What precautions can I take when using insect repellents?</h3><p>Repellents have been tested and designed for use in certain ways. Only use a repellent in ways that are described on the label. Following the label directions and the tips below can minimize your risk.</p><p>Apply just enough of a repellent to cover exposed skin.

Follow label directions to find out how long to wait before reapplying.</p><p>Do not use under clothing.</p><p>Do not apply on open cuts, irritated, or sunburned skin.</p><p>Do not spray repellents on the face, in ears, or near the eyes or mouth. To apply repellent to the face, first apply it to your hands and then rub it onto your face.</p><p>Wash skin and treated clothing when returning indoors.</p><p>Wash clothing prior to wearing again.</p><p>Mixing a repellent with sunscreen can affect how your skin absorbs the products.</p>"
ankle holsters,"<h2>FAQs on ankle holsters</h2><h3>Is It a Good Idea to Get an Ankle Holster?</h3><p>Ankle holsters are great at concealment and come in handy for carrying a backup firearm. These two qualities make them a worthy investment for any serious gun owner who owns more than one firearm.</p><h3>Is It Possible to Run While Wearing an Ankle Holster?</h3><p>Yes, it's possible to run while wearing an ankle holster. However, being able to do so without experiencing extreme discomfort or harboring the fear of losing your firearm is another matter.<br /><br />Ankle holsters already contend with being the most difficult type of holster to draw from. So when you add a vigorous physical activity like running, jumping, or climbing into the equation, their ease-of-use and comfort level plummets even further. For the above reason, it's best to limit your walking speed to a brisk stroll when wearing an ankle holster.</p><h3>What Are Some Drawbacks to Using Ankle Holsters?</h3><p>Drawing a firearm from an ankle holster isn't the easiest action to take from a standing position, and carrying an ankle holster while running is impractical. You're also only able to carry very small firearms with ankle holsters. All in all, the choice of getting an ankle holster depends on your needs, so you'll have to weigh the benefits against detriments.</p><h3>Which Leg Should I Put the Ankle Holster On?</h3><p>Ankle holsters are usually worn on the leg that's opposite to the wearer's dominant hand. So you'll wear them on the left leg if you're right-handed and vice versa if you're left-handed. In particular, the holster is worn on the inside of the leg because wearing it on the outside leaves the holster prone to bumping into things.</p><p>Less commonly, holsters are worn on the same leg as the wearer's dominant hand, with the gun's grip faced outward. However, positioning the holster on this leg makes it awkward to draw the gun from a standing position.</p><h3>Which Guns Are Good to Carry in an Ankle Holster?</h3><p>In general, ankle holsters aren't meant to carry full-size firearms because the gun's size and weight may prove problematic for movement and concealment. In fact, carrying a heavier firearm can actually cause hip and knee problems over time.<br />Therefore, ankle holsters are more commonly used to carry and conceal smaller guns.</p><h3>Can ankle holsters hold more than one ammunition?</h3><p>Some ankle holsters can hold more than one ammunition, while some can only carry one ammo. So again, it depends on the kind of holster you buy.</p><h3>Can you wear an ankle holster with boots?</h3><p>Yes, depending on the holster. Some holsters were designed specifically with boot wearers in mind while others were created for use by detectives, white-collar workers, and other bootless individuals.</p>"
camping tents,"<h2>FAQs about camping tents</h2><h3>What size do I need?</h3><p>Tents are available in a variety of sizes, from small to large. The best way to determine what size tent you need is to measure the length and width of your bedroll or sleeping bag, then add 10 inches for the height.</p><p>What are the 5 parts of a tent?</p><p>Tent poles, air tubes, groundsheets, guy ropes and pegs.</p><div>When should you use a dome tent? These tents are perfect for campsites as their size means they are heavy to carry around for any length of time. Additionally, they are best used when pitched facing into winds as if they are hit by heavy gusts side on, there is a risk they may collapse.<p>Always use a large ground tarp under the tent as a barrier to moisture seepage from the ground even if your tent is waterproof. Ideally, you should own a tent which includes a waterproof rain shield or large rain fly. If not, then you will need to hang tarps with ropes attached to trees or poles.</p><h3>What holds a tent down?</h3><p>There are two basic options when it comes to securing your canopy tent: anchors or weights. Anchors attach to the tent's canopy and get staked into the ground, whereas weights simply hold down and secure the canopy with their weight alone and do not have to be staked into the ground.</p><h3>How long do tents usually last?</h3>You should be able to get 100 days out of a camping tent if you take good care of it. This equates to 10 years if you camp for 10 nights a year and 5 years if you camp around 20 nights a year.<h3>How much does a tent cost?</h3><p>Tents can range anywhere from $150 to over $500 depending on materials, features, and brand.

If you plan to bring along a dog, make sure you get one that can fit inside the tent as well. Otherwise, you'll end up having to keep him/her penned up outside, which isn't ideal for dogs. Make sure you measure your site before you order to ensure you get the right size for your specific use case.</p><h3>How much do cabin tents cost?</h3><p>Cabin tents are available in a variety of sizes and styles, so the price will vary depending on what you get.

If the tarp extends too far, even dew will run down the tent walls and collect under your tent. When camping at the beach, don't put a tarp under the tent, but rather inside the tent.</p><h3>How do I know what size tarp I need?</h3><p>Generally, the width of the tarp just needs to be about a foot wider than your trailer, this will enable water to shed beyond the trailer walls while still allowing good air flow.

compact binoculars,"<h2>FAQs on Compact Binoculars</h2><h3>What is a compact binocular?</h3><p>There is no hard and fast rule for buying binoculars, but a compact binocular is a small binocular, small enough to fit in a large pocket or a purse.</p><h3>How do I adjust my compact binoculars?</h3><p>Most binoculars use a similar nosepiece design, but some manufacturers offer proprietary adjustments to improve the fit of the binoculars over your eyes.

This is a great way to confirm that an animal you saw is, in fact, what you were expecting. In addition, binoculars can be used to identify features of interest like tracks, scat, or vegetation, which can help you narrow down your search for the animal you're tracking. For those who prefer to avoid using optics, there are times when binoculars can be useful for finding game trails and identifying landmarks.</p><h3>What is the difference between compact and binoculars?</h3><p>Experts categorize compact binoculars as having a lens diameter of 28 mm-36 mm, and full-size binoculars as having a lens diameter of around 40 mm (42 mm is the most common value).</p><h3>How do I choose travel binoculars?</h3><p>In general, the larger your objective lens, the larger your binoculars will be, which naturally is good to keep in mind for your packing as well as your tolerance for how large a pair you want to carry.

pens for writing,"<h2>FAQs about pens for writing</h2><h3>What is the best size pen for writing?</h3><p>The best size pen for writing is one that matches your hand and wrist size. If you have small hands, a fine-tipped pen might not be the best choice. A larger pen with a rubber grip might be better.</p><h3>What type of pen is easiest to write with?</h3><p>Rollerball, ballpoint, gel pens, or fountain pens are considered the best tools for writing quickly, for a number of reasons: Less drag on the paper, which reduces the amount of pressure you need to apply. Better quality ink requires less effort to put pen to paper, meaning decreased strain on your fingers and wrist.</p><h3>How do I choose a pen?</h3><p>Try out different pens to discover what type of ink you like best. Find an ink that looks good and serves your needs. People who like writing thick, smooth lines will do well with a quality ballpoint or gel ink pen. If you prefer the control and neat appearance of thin, sharp lines, go for a rollerball or fountain pen.</p><h3>Which pen lasts longest?</h3><p>Since the ink is thick, ballpoint pens use less ink as you write, lasting longer than other pen types.</p><h3>Is ballpoint or rollerball better?</h3><p>Rollerball ink flows much more freely, producing a vivid line that's thicker and more dynamic than most ballpoints, which makes them a great choice for writing in cards or sending a handwritten note.</p><h3>How do I clean my pen?</h3><p>Wipe off any dirt or residue with a dry cloth or paper towel. Avoid using alcohol or harsh chemicals to clean your pen as they could damage the finish on your pen. You can also use mild dish soap if you prefer, but avoid abrasive cleansers like scouring powders and steel wool. These will scratch the finish of your pen and leave unsightly black streaks. Also, avoid soaking your pen in water, as this could cause rust to form. If you're concerned about scratching the finish, consider getting a pen cover.</p><h3>Are there different finishes on pens?</h3><p>There are several finishes available for fountain pens, from gold plating to various types of lacquer. The most common finish is gold plating, which gives the pen a bright, shiny appearance. Gold plated pens tend to be more delicate than other finishes, so they're not great for rough handling like signing checks. Lacquer finishes are less common, but can add a nice layer of protection against scratches and corrosion. They tend to be slightly darker in color than gold plating, but still very shiny and reflective. Black lacquer is becoming more popular, and looks fantastic when paired with midnight blue or navy ink. It's also harder to scratch than gold plating, so it's a good choice for those who need their pen to last. It's important to note that not all manufacturers offer lacquer finishes, so make.</p>"

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a standard for protection against blunt force trauma as 70 percent effective at stopping all rifle rounds.</p><h3>How important is a ballistic helmet?</h3><p>Combat helmets provide protection against ballistic threats and blunt impact forces, and wearing them has greatly reduced head injuries and saved lives of many soldiers.</p><h3>What is the best material for making a ballistic helmet?</h3><p>The best material for a ballistic helmet is titanium, but there are several other options available, including ceramic, steel, and composite materials like carbon fiber and kevlar. Some manufacturers offer their helmets in different materials, so it's important to check out the product page carefully before ordering. If you plan on doing any physical activity that could potentially lead to head injury, it's probably best to go with something made from high-tensile steel, which offers protection against rifle fire, shrapnel, and blunt force trauma.</p><h3>How long are ballistic helmets good for?</h3><p>While companies may offer warranties coving their ballistic helmets for anywhere from 5 years to a lifetime, this doesn't necessarily mean that their helmet will meet the same performance specs as it did the day it came off the production line.</p><h3>How heavy is a ballistic helmet?</h3><p>Size 1 is 1.66 lbs (0.75 kg). Size 2 is 1.68 lbs (0.76 kg). Complete system weight includes the helmet shell, shroud, accessory rails, impact liner and retention system.</p><h3>Are ballistic helmets legal?</h3><p>As far as the federal government is concerned, you are okay to purchase body armor and ballistic helmets as long as you are not a felon who has been convicted of a violent crime. However, this does not necessarily protect you from state and local laws.</p><h3>Is a Ballistic Helmet worth if you're not military?</h3><p>It depends on the situation. Law enforcement, security guards, correctional officers and people in related similar professions are more likely to be threatened with impact weapons and thrown projectiles than bullets.</p><h3>Is a ballistic helmet useful to someone facing blunt impact threats?</h3><p>YES, thanks to the blunt impact protection that these helmets also provide.</p><p>A chair hitting the head in just the wrong spot can be just as deadly as a bullet, and the blunt impact performance of a ballistic helmet can be a literal lifesaver in these cases.</p>"

bedside gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about Bedside Gun Safes</h2><h3>Are gun safes worth it?</h3><p>Yes. Although a lockable case won't prevent a thief from stealing your gun (by stealing the case), it does act as a deterrent and greatly reduces the chances of an unauthorized user from gaining access to your firearm, while simultaneously giving you quick access. A gun safe, on the other hand, is better suited for preventing theft because of the bulk and weight.</p><h3>Can I put a gun safe in my bedroom?</h3><div>Never put a large safe or gun safe in popular places: garage, den, guest bedroom closet, spare bedroom, coat closet, hidden places because those are potential places to visit by burglars when they come into a house.</div><h3>Where should I keep my gun in the bedroom?</h3><p>For a bedside gun safe, it makes sense to mount it within easy reach of where you sleep. That said, make sure your safe is secured to the floor, wall, or similar anchor point so a burglar can't walk away with the unopened safe in hand while you're out on the town.</p><h3>What is your nightstand gun?</h3><p>Whether you call it a nightstand gun or a bedside gun, the concept is the same:a firearm you keep near your bed in the event that you need to defend yourself (and your family) from a threat that emerges while you're asleep.</p><h3>How much protection does a bedside gun safe provide?</h3><p>A good gun safe provides the same level of protection as your firearm would while in its locked position, but it's not foolproof. If you were to somehow gain access to the lock mechanism, you could still remove the door and get to your firearm before someone else could react. The best way to prevent this from happening is to keep your firearm loaded and secured away from where you sleep.</p><h3>What size should my bedside gun safe be?</h3><p>Your gun safe should be large enough to hold your firearm comfortably with accessories (like a pistol grip cover) attached. Make sure you measure your firearm's length between the trigger guard and muzzle before buying. Also, make sure you have room for all of your valuables, including ammunition, and that your firearm can fit inside when open. That said, don't go overboard on the size-upgrades are available for an additional cost.</p><h3>Do biometric gun safes work?</h3><p>We recommend avoiding biometric gun safes as their electronic components are susceptible to water damage and can be unreliable. Also, many biometric safes come with very loose fingerprint reading tolerances in order to maximize your ability to open the safe. Unfortunately, this results in a higher likelihood of a false positive reading, giving unauthorized individual access to your weapon.</p>"

compasses,"<h2>FAQs on Compasses</h2><h3>How do you use a compass?</h3><p>Follow the directions. The needle will swing in a circle around your finger, indicating which direction is north.</p><div><h3>How do you navigate using a compass?</h3></div>The north marker on the compass' bezel should point north on the map. The number that aligns with your index line is your bearing. To follow that bearing, turn your body until the needle is inside the orienting arrow. The direction-of-travel arrow now points toward your destination.</div><h3>How do you know which direction is north?</h3></div>Use sunrise and sunset for approximate directions.<br />Face the sunrise and you are facing east; north will be on your left and south will be on your right. Face the sunset and you are facing west; north will be on your right and south will be on your left.</div></div><h3>What is the best time to take a compass reading?</h3><p>Any time of day or night is fine, but avoid direct sunlight and keep the magnetic needle pointed toward the North Pole. If you're indoors with a window, that's ideal. Otherwise, look for a shadowed area where there isn't much interference from electrical devices or other metal objects. That should be somewhere between 45 and 135 degrees away from true north. Make sure your compass has good batteries before taking a reading, as they drain over time. Also, make sure you understand how to read the markings on your compass before using it to navigate. Your map might indicate magnetic north, but your compass may show true north.

Additionally, Damascus knives are typically made from 1095 carbon steels, so they're tougher than most knives.</p><h3>Why are Damascus knives so popular?</h3><p>Damascus Steel is very popular because it offers excellent blade properties such as strength and durability with good flexibility for cutting ability while remaining relatively easy to forge compared to other metals like high carbon steel or stainless steel.</p><h3>Are Damascus knives good?</h3><p>A well-made Damascus blade will retain its sharpness for longer than most production quality blades, but if the goal is to use the best performing blade steel, you may find it elsewhere. In saying that, quality is largely determined by how much it costs. True 'name brand' Damascus steel is of the highest quality.</p><h3>How tough are Damascus knives?</h3><p>Damascus knives are tough enough to shave with, but not quite tough enough to cut through bone or wood without a good amount of pressure behind the blade. That being said, Damascus knives aren't designed to take on anything more challenging than your standard kitchen knife. If you plan on using your Damascus knife to cut wood or bones, you might end up hurting yourself. Also, Damascus knives don't hold an edge very long, so if you're going to be doing any serious cutting, you'll want to keep a honing stone handy.</p><h3>Why is Damascus steel so valuable?</h3><p>Aside from being beautiful, Damascus steel is valued because&nbsp;it maintains a keen edge, yet is hard and flexible. Weapons made from Damascus steel are vastly superior to weapons formed from iron!</p><div><h3>How many layers of Damascus steel is the knife made of?</h3></div><p>Damascus steel is known for its multiple layers, but just how many layers are enough? Straight laminated billets of Damascus should have anywhere between 300 and 500 layers in order to achieve the perfect aesthetic.</p><h3>Can Damascus steel be faked?</h3><p>By folding layers upon layers of metal together, this is precisely how they were able to develop flexible yet still durable metal alloy. The problem was that once the swords started getting popular, many people began to counterfeit them, and now you can find fake Damascus steel almost everywhere.</p><h3>How much is a Damascus knife worth?</h3><p>Plenty of Damascus knives are budget-friendly and priced at $60 or less. You'll find quite a few pocket knives, survival knives, and hunting knives within this price range. Beware of Damascus knives in this price range that are made in the Middle East/India and advertised as 'handmade'.</p>"
gun oils,"<h2>FAQs about Gun Oils</h2><div><h3>How much do gun oils cost?</h3><p>Depending on the size of the product, gun oils run anywhere from a few dollars to around $20. You can buy gun oil and cleaner kits in this same price range or for a few dollars more.</p></div><div><h3>Is gun grease better than oil?</h3><p>It's not that gun grease is better than oil, but that they both are better suited in different conditions. Gun oils are less viscous than gun grease and are more than capable for lubricating and preventing rust on hunting rifles. Gun grease is often applied for long term storage (think surplus military rifles that are coated religiously) or to guns that see harsh conditions and extreme use. Most gun oils can handle the needs of the average hunter or shooter.</p></div><h3>What is the difference between gun oil and motor oil?</h3><p>Gun oil is designed to protect and lubricate firearms, while motor oil is designed for your car's internal combustion engine. The main difference between the two is that gun oil is petroleum-based, while motor oil is synthetic.</p><h3>How often should I oil my gun?</h3><p>How often you should oil your gun depends on the gun and how you use it. If it's a gun that gets heavy use, then it should be cleaned and oiled regularly. If it's a gun that sits in the safe for most of the year, then it won't need nearly as much oiling. A good rule of thumb for those pieces would be to take them out and oil them twice a year.</p><h3>How do I clean a firearm after shooting?</h3><p>The best way to clean a firearm after shooting is with a mild soap solution and water. If you're worried about rust, then use a little TLC (treat metal with a little TLC) and apply a light coat of CLP or WD-40 if you have it. You can also use a cleaning kit from Brownells or Cammenga, but we don't recommend them because they tend to be over-packaged and full of unnecessary tools. We prefer to keep things simple and use only what we need. That being said, if you absolutely must use something like a cleaning kit, make sure to rinse the inside of the barrel thoroughly before proceeding.</p>"
camping chairs,"<h2>FAQs about Camping Chairs</h2><h3>What size do I need?</h3><p>The best way to determine how many seats your group will require is to measure the length of your longest side.

They're also very compact when collapsed, making them great for car camping or backyard get-togethers. However, they're not built for heavy use like in the backcountry, so don't expect them to hold up against the elements for very long. Also, note that they're not waterproof, so don't expect them to keep you cool while you're under the sun. That said, they're still perfectly adequate for most uses, especially those where weatherproofing isn't a concern.</p><h3>Are folding chairs better?</h3><p>Folding chairs are easier to pack into tight spaces and collapse for convenient storage. They also fold up to a more manageable size for car camping or backyard parties, but they lack the sturdiness of traditional camping chairs. Still, they're an excellent option for families with small children who want something comfortable for the kids to sit on while parents eat or play cards. Just make sure you choose one that has high enough seating height to accommodate your tallest person. Otherwise, you may find yourself with a kid sitting on the ground and an adult in the air, which could be dangerous. Make sure you choose a chair that has a safety harness if you plan to use it for any extended period of time. This will ensure that no one falls out of the chair during a bumpy ride.</p><div><h3>Can You Use a Camping Chair On the Beach?</h3><p>Yes! All camping chairs work on the beach. However, there are a few things to be mindful of. For example, a large, more durable camping chair can be the most stable to use on the beach; they have feet wide enough to help dissipate your weight, not resulting in the camping chair legs slowly commencing eating up by the sand.</p></div><h3>How Much Weight Does a Camping Chair Hold?</h3><p>Like camping chairs or lawn chairs, most folding chairs can bear weight between 300 and 800 pounds. Manufacturers and the quality of the material directly influence the durability and weight-bearing capacity of camping chairs.</p><h3>Can You Take a Camping Chair On a Plane?</h3><p>Yes! You can take a camping chair on a plane. There are no restrictions on bringing portable camp chairs on the plane. As most airlines show a size or weight limit for carry-on baggage and check, you are good to go if your chair easily fits in your suitcase.</p><h3>How Do You Dry a Camping Chair?</h3><p>The best way to dry your camping chairs is to let them air-dry completely in the direct sunlight. Then, once you see them dry, store them in a dry place until you plan your next camping trip.</p>"

dive watches under 500,"<h2>FAQs about dive watches</h2><h3>What is a dive watch used for?</h3><p>Dive watches are designed to be worn underwater, so they can be used to check your air consumption while diving or as a water-resistant timepiece for the beach. They're also built to withstand the shock of being dropped in water, which makes them great for surfers and divers alike who like to keep track of their time underwater without fear of damaging the watch.</p><h3>Do I really need a dive watch?</h3><p>Most people don't actually need a dive watch. Yet still, it's one of the most popular designs in the world. The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of people don't actually go diving with their dive watch. But if you do intend to go diving, you can wear your watch without having to worry about it breaking. And it has been proven time and time again that a dive watch can look just as good with smoking as with swim trunks.</p><h3>How much does a dive watch cost?</h3><p>A good quality dive watch will cost between $250 and $350, but you'll find some very nice watches for less than $200. The Rolex Submariner is one of my favorite watches for under $200, and it's a certified diver's watch, so I know it can take a beating and still keep on ticking. That said, I wouldn't recommend buying a cheap knockoff unless you plan to customize the case with precious metals or engravings. If you want something that looks almost exactly like the Rolex Submariner, save up for the real deal, but don't expect it to last long if you go hammering around the bottom of the ocean.</p><h3>How big should a dive watch be?</h3><p>There is no official requirements in terms of size that a dive watch has to meet. There are also no guidelines on how big a dive watch should be. With this said, it ultimately comes down to your taste and preference. Which size do you think works best on your wrist? But because dive watches are sports watches, it's good to remember that their design tends to be bulkier and larger than many other designs. And diameter is not the only thing that affects how a watch wears on the wrist.</p><h3>How and when do I wear a dive watch?</h3><p>Overall, dive watches are more sporty than dressy, and therefore fit more casual occasions where you don't need to worry about fitting one underneath a shirt cuff. However, James Bond has established the trend of wearing a Rolex Submariner or Omega Seamaster on more formal occasions, so these days it's a lot less strict. Additionally, you can find dive-style watches appointed in precious metals and with jewels, and so it's a personal preference these days.</p><h3>What's the point of a rotating bezel on a watch?</h3><p>The rotating bezel is a crucial element of a dive watch as it serves an important purpose. The bezel normally rotates only in one direction (hence why it is called unidirectional) and is graduated into 60 divisions. The markings correspond to 60 minutes in an hour and serve the purpose of measuring the elapsed time underwater. This is done to calculate the remaining oxygen in the tank of the diver and to avoid putting themselves in a risky situation where the oxygen runs out whilst underwater.</p>"
hiking backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about hiking backpacks</h2><h3>What is the best size hiking backpack?</h3><p>Backpackers tend to prefer packs that are a little bigger, with room for everything you need while on a multi-day trek. That said, smaller packs can be just as effective and lighter to carry around.</p><h3>How much does a good hiking backpack cost?</h3><p>A good quality pack will cost between $250 and $350 dollars. Premium manufacturers like Mountain Hardwear and Black Diamond sell high-end packs for over $500. If you plan to take any of the technical climbing gear listed in our packing list, you'll want to spring for the Black Diamond Passage 60 or 70Lite. Those packs weigh less than five pounds each and have enough room for all your needs. The only downside is they're not cheap, coming in at $550 and up. But if you plan to do anything beyond day hikes, you'll want something that can hold more weight and has more room for supplies. That's where the premium manufacturers come in.</p><h3>How heavy should a hiking backpack be?</h3><p>A good rule of thumb is that your pack should feel comfortable when sitting on the ground with your arms outstretched. If it doesn't fit that way, then it's too heavy. I recommend avoiding anything heavier than 20 pounds unless you're carrying a lot of food and water for extended periods of time. Anything over 30 pounds starts to get unwieldy and uncomfortable, especially if you're doing any strenuous activity. Stick with lighter loads for shorter treks and go big for longer adventures. Make sure you test your loadout before leaving by carrying your heaviest load for an extended period of time and see how it feels.</p><h3>How big of a backpack do I need for 3 months?</h3><p>I would suggest you bring a bag between 50-65L, which I found is the best size for me. I loved my 60L backpack because it was big enough to fit all my stuff in it, and there was always extra space. It wasn't too big to be uncomfortable or impractical to carry.</p>"

If you're looking to lose weight, get stronger, or just want to avoid shin splints, then you'll want to invest in some quality poles. I recommend buying two pairs, one for each leg, so you can switch between legs as needed. You might find that you prefer using them on the uphill side of your walks, while your partner uses them on the downhill side. That's fine, just remember to switch sides before you take off. It's also important to practice walking with them extended out to their full length, so you don't over extend your arms and risk falling over.</p><h3>What is the best type of hiking pole?</h3><p>Hiking poles come in many shapes and sizes, but generally speaking, they're either carbon fiber or composite construction, and have three to five inches of rigid plastic or carbon fiber extending from the handle to the tip. The longer the pole, the more leverage you have, and therefore, the farther you can push yourself. Composite construction is lighter and more flexible than carbon fiber.</p><h3>How do you pick the best trekking poles?</h3><p>Find the right length: You're aiming for a 90-degree bend at your elbow when pole tips touch the ground. Choose features: Adjustability, foldability, shock absorption, weight and locking mechanisms (for adjustable poles) are just some of the features and options that will guide your buying choice.</p><h3>Is it better to hike with one pole or two?</h3><p>Hiking with one pole or walking stick gives greater benefits than not using a hiking pole at all. However, using two poles will allow you to get a more symmetrical workout, provide more balance, enhance endurance, and even boost your overall speed. Realistically, a single hiking pole is better than no pole at all.</p>"
binoculars for hunting,"<h2>FAQs on binoculars for hunting</h2><h3>How do I adjust my binoculars?</h3><p>Most binoculars include some form of adjustment mechanism, usually found on the side of the lens, to allow you to change the eye relief (the distance between your eyes and the end of the tube) or magnification. If your binoculars don't have this feature, you can use a screwdriver to adjust the diopter (or ""power"") on the lenses.</p><h3>How much does a pair of binoculars cost?</h3><p>You can expect to pay anywhere from $250 to $500 for entry-level binoculars, $500 to $800 for mid-range binoculars, and $800 to $1,200 for high-end binoculars. Premium brands tend to be more expensive than their budget counterparts, but quality often outweighs price.</p><h3>What should I look for when buying binoculars?</h3><p>The best bet is to look for binoculars that have fully multi-coated lenses. This means that all lens surfaces have been treated with multiple layers of coating to increase light transmission, reduce glare, and protect the lens from scratching or chipping. You should also ensure the binoculars are waterproofed and either Argon or Nitrogen purged to prevent internal fogging.</p><h3>What size binocular lenses are best for hunting?</h3><p>This is dependent on your style of hunting. If you are on the move constantly, you may not want heavy or bulky binoculars, so a pair with a lower objective lens size might be more beneficial. If you are a stationary hunter, having something with a greater objective lens will help brighten the images you glass.</p><h3>Which binocular magnification is better for hunting?</h3><p>An 8x or 10x, no larger, would do great for the hunter looking to call something into spitting distance, but still give their vision the edge that binoculars do. And often times for archery elk, you may do a combination of spot and stalk and calling tactics, so having an optic that is suited for both is ideal.</p>"
rucking backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about rucking backpacks</h2><h3>What is the difference between a rucksack and backpack?</h3><p>Rucksacks are typically designed for heavier loads with the hiker or military member in mind. Backpacks can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and purposes.</p><h3>How do I pack a ruck?</h3><p>Rucks are designed to fit over your shoulders, with padded straps that allow you to carry loads anywhere from 15 to 25 pounds comfortably. The shoulder strap can be adjusted to fit either the right or left shoulder, and the length of the ruck can be adjusted to fit your height.</p><h3>What is the best size for a ruckpack?</h3><p>Rucks are designed to fit over your shoulders, with padded straps that allow you to carry loads anywhere from 15 to 25 pounds comfortably. The shoulder strap can be adjusted to fit either the right or left shoulder, and the length of the ruck can be adjusted to fit your height. If you plan on carrying anything heavier than 20 pounds, get an XL version instead.</p><h3>How much weight can you ruck with?</h3><p>Depending on the quality of the pack and type of frame, your ability to carry and move with the weight, you may find your answer. In the military, it is typical to carry anywhere from 55 to 80 pounds of gear depending on the mission or training outcome.</p><h3>What are the benefits of rucking?</h3><p>With a heavy load on your body and walking at a brisk pace, you pick up a cardio-like exercise. It helps build strength in your legs, back, and shoulders.</p>"
fleece jackets,"<h2>FAQs on fleece jackets</h2><h3>What is the best fabric for a fleece jacket?</h3><p>Fleece jackets are made from synthetic materials like polyester or nylon, but they can also be made from natural materials like wool or silk. The best material depends on what you intend to do with your jacket. If you plan to keep it casual and wear it around town, a synthetic option might work better.</p><h3>Does Fleece Repel Water?</h3><p>Fleece, by nature, is hydrophobic. This means its threads cannot absorb water. (What petroleum-based product does?) So, yes, fleece holds up in light rain. However, it's not waterproof at all, and should not be mistaken for a rain shell, ever.</p><h3>Is Fleece Breathable?</h3><p>You could argue that the key to a fleece jacket is its breathability. When hiking you want a layer to fend off a morning or evening chill, but you don't want to sweat so much you're hot and gross. When the right fleece jacket is paired with the right activity your problems are solved.</p><h3>How tight should a fleece jacket be?</h3><p>A good rule of thumb is that if you could see your nipples through the sleeve, then it's too tight. Otherwise, it's fine. Just make sure you have room to move your arms without constricting them. Also, avoid wearing a thin layer underneath as this will show through and look frumpy. Instead, go with a lightweight sweater or something similar that doesn't cling to your skin. You'll thank me later.</p><h3>What's the difference between fleece and microfleece?</h3><p>Chemically, they're the same fabric. Microfleece is just a lighter version typically below - 100 g/m2 in weight.</p>"
rain boots,"<h2>FAQs on rain boots</h2><h3>How do you clean a pair of rain boots?</h3><p>Wash them inside and out with mild soap and water, then hang them in the closet to dry. Repeat this process every few months or when needed. If you want to remove the waterproofing, you can use a stiff-bristled brush to get rid of dirt and grime.</p><h3>Can you wear rain boots all day?</h3><p>Yes, you can wear them as long as you like. Some boots are more comfortable for all-day use, but they are generally intended to be worn for long periods of time.</p><h3>What is the difference between full and half boots?</h3><p>Full boots are ankle-high and extend over the calf. They're great for outdoor activities like hiking or skiing, but they don't have room for a gusseted liner, so they rub against your skin and can chafe. Half boots are shorter and end just below the knee, so they won't rub against your skin and can include a gusseted liner for extra comfort. They're great for indoor pursuits like working from home or going to the gym, but they won't keep you warm while you work or workout, so you'll need good socks to go along with them. Also, they tend to be bulkier than regular boots, so if you plan to wear them for any strenuous activity, you might want to break them in first. You can also purchase waterproofing for your existing boots to make them rainproof and water resistant.</p><h3>Why should I wear rain boots?</h3><p>Rain boots are designed to keep water out of your shoes while providing maximum mobility and support. They also help wick moisture away from your feet, keeping them warm and dry while you work or play. They're an essential piece of equipment for outdoor workers, especially those who work in wet environments, like construction or landscaping. They're also great for indoor workers who need to maintain some level of warmth and protection from water.</p><h3>Wha's the difference between rain boots and galoshes?</h3><p>Rain boots are designed to be worn on their own; a rain boot is a full shoe. Galoshes are coverings that you wear over your shoes to make them waterproof.</p>"
rooftop tents,"<h2>FAQs about rooftop tents</h2><h3>How do I set up a rooftop tent?</h3><p>The best way to set up a rooftop tent is with the ground poles first, then the roof pole. Make sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions for setting up your tent. If you don't, you could wind up with a collapsed tent or worse, a broken pole. It's also important to remember that the weather can change at any time, so make sure you're comfortable with your tent's set-up before taking it down in the rain. If you're not comfortable with the tent's set-up, get someone who is.</p><h3>What size should my rooftop tent be?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are designed to fit a certain height and weight range. Most manufacturers offer their tents in small (5'6"" to 6'0"" tall), medium (6'1"" to 6'8"" tall) or large (6'9"" to 7'4"" tall). Some manufacturers offer smaller and larger sizes as well. Be sure to measure your height and weight when shopping to ensure you get the right size for your height and weight. Also, check out our tips on how to pack a rooftop tent into your car for easy transportability. If you plan to take your tent on long trips, consider getting a two-person version instead. That way, if one person gets stuck in the rain, the other can still enjoy the shelter. If you have a four-season tent, you might want to consider putting a tarp over the top of it during the winter months. This will help insulate the tent from the elements and keep it dry. You'll also save money by not having to buy a new tent for each season.</p><h3>Can You Put a Rooftop Tent on a Car?</h3><p>Many rooftop tents are designed to be mounted on cars. But not every tent will fit every car. The size and weight of the tent need to match the size and carrying capacity of your car's roof rack. For best results, use aftermarket bars, not standard factory-installed racks. Also, check the car manufacturers and the roof rack manufacturer's websites for compatibility.</p><h3>Why Are Rooftop Tents So Expensive?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are more expensive than most ground-staked tents because of the materials, engineering and design, and accessories. Rooftop tents flip over to create a platform with a tent on top of your car. That's a whole lot more complicated than creating a structure with a fabric floor that gets placed on the ground.Then, throw in a mattress, ladder, and a hardshell exterior, and you can see why rooftop tents are costly.</p>"
hiking pants for men,"<h2>FAQs about hiking pants for men</h2><h3>How tight should hiking pants be?</h3><p>Hiking pants should fit snugly enough to where you can wiggle your toes, but not so tight that they rub or chafe against the skin. If you're a little bigger than average, go with something a little looser.</p><h3>What fabric should my hiking pants be made of?</h3><p>Hiking pants are usually made from lightweight synthetic materials like polyester and nylon, although there are some premium manufacturers who use more traditional materials like cotton and wool. The best thing to do is try them on in the store and see how they fit. If they feel too tight, you can always take out a couple inches of material from the bottom of the leg and/or the crotch. If they feel too baggy, you can trim off a bit of material from the top of the leg and/or the thigh area. Make sure to keep the gusseted crotch in mind when making adjustments.</p><h3>Is It OK to Hike in Jeans?</h3><div><div><p>Jeans are not the best option because they are made of cotton and cotton does not wick away moisture. They're also not breathable, have no stretch, and are quite heavy. In general, you'll want to stay away from clothing made of cotton, linen, denim, or anything stiff.</p></div></div><h3>How durable should hiking pants be?</h3><p>Hiking pants will last as long as you care for them, but they won't hold up to anything crazy. Avoid wearing your hiking pants while doing things that could cause abrasion, such as running, climbing, or skiing, if possible.</p><h3>Are hiking pants good for all seasons?</h3><p>Yes, but you'll want to make sure to pack accordingly. Cotton and wool fabrics perform well in cooler weather, while synthetic materials work great in warmer temperatures.

They're made from lightweight synthetic materials and feature three-stitch construction throughout, including a reinforced</p>"
night vision goggles,"<h2>FAQs on night vision goggles</h2><h3>How much do night vision goggles cost?</h3><p>Night vision goggles are expensive, but you can find quality optics for a reasonable price. The latest generation of NVGs typically cost between $600 and $800, while older generations cost closer to $300 to $400. That said, there are plenty of budget-friendly options out there that offer excellent performance.</p><h3>What are night vision goggles used for?</h3><p>Night vision devices let you see in the dark. With quality night vision goggles and scopes you can see people, animals, and objects up to 1,000 yards away on a dark night. Night vision monocular cameras let you take photographs and videos of things you can't see in the dark with your naked eyes.</p><h3>Do night-vision goggles really work?</h3><p>Yes, night-vision goggles really work. They let you see objects in total darkness, even if those objects are football fields ahead of you. One way night-vision goggles work is by converting the small amount of light photons that are present at night into electrical current and amplifying those electrons before converting them back into visible light. Thermal goggles detect heat energy, letting you see the shapes of images, even in situations where there truly is no light - like in a smoky building.</p><h3>How far will a night vision device allow me to see?</h3><p>The range of a night vision device depends on its design and technical parameters. It also depends on the type of object being viewed, as each object has its own detection and recognition range. The clarity and the brightness of the night sky will also affect the performance of the device.</p><h3>Are night vision goggles illegal?</h3><p>Not at all. In the USA, there's nothing stopping you from owning and using night vision goggles legally. All night vision equipment is legal. However, there are certain laws in some states that prohibit their use when hunting at night. For the best answer, check your local state laws regarding night hunting and the use of night vision devices.</p>"
pocket knives,"<h2>FAQs on pocket knives</h2><h3>What is the best type of knife for self-defense?</h3><p>The answer to this question depends heavily on your lifestyle and environment.

If you live in a rural area, a fixed-edge blade may be more appropriate.</p><h3>How sharp should a folding knife be?</h3><p>Sharpening steels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, but most folding knives will maintain an edge for somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes if given enough time to sharpen itself. That being said, there are times when you might need a knife that can penetrate things faster than that, so it's important to understand how well your knife performs as-new before taking it to a shop to have it sharpened. Also, keep in mind that the edge doesn't stay sharp forever, so don't expect it to hold up against multiple attackers indefinitely. It's also important to remember that knives are tools, not toys, so treat them responsibly and keep them away</p><h3>Are Serrations Good on a Pocket Knife?</h3><p>The answer to this question is a resounding no 99% of the time. While many brands include these little metal teeth, they usually diminish the overall functionality of a knife. Serrations break up the edge of a blade, reducing your capacity for long, clean slices. That's not to say they're useless, however. If you find yourself dealing with a lot of rope or cordage, serrations are actually quite beneficial. But when breaking down cardboard, opening packages, slicing food, or carving, they're definitely more of a nuisance.</p><h3>What is considered a pocket knife? What defines it?</h3><p>Pocket knives are blades that fold into their handle and range from 2-6 inches.</p><h3>Are pocket knives allowed on planes?</h3><p>Yes, but strictly in your checked baggage.

red dot sights,"<h2>FAQs on red dot sights</h2><h3>What makes a red dot sight different from other firearms optics?</h3><p>Red dot sights are designed to be mounted flush on the rear of your firearm, usually either on top or below the rear sight. They are not telescopic and do not extend beyond the length of your barrel. The dot is fixed in size and does not change with magnification.</p><h3>How far do red dot sights work?</h3><p>100 yards away Typically, if you use a red dot sight without any magnification, you can easily aim at a target as far as 100 yards away, if not more.</p><h3>Do you need to zero a red dot?</h3><p>They provide a clear, wide sight picture and they don't suffer from parallax error (that means your head and eye placement doesn't matter). But to squeeze that accuracy out of your new red dot, you need to zero it so your point of aim matches your point of impact.</p><h3>How does a red dot sight work?</h3><p>Red dot sights work in one of two ways, depending on whether the sight is reflex or holographic. Reflex sights use an LED and coated glass to bounce the image of the red dot back to the user. A holographic sight, on the other hand, uses a laser and mirrors to project a red dot that appears to be in front of the optic back to the user.</p><h3>Are red dot sights worth the money?</h3><p>Unless you've got glow in the dark irons or something, the odds of your shots being on target decrease dramatically in low-light or changing light conditions.

If they're leather, just wear them around the house for a few days to break them in. If they're synthetic, use a stiffening spray like VibramSox or Flex-a-lite on the inside of the boot to give it a little more flexibility and make sure to wear them around the house for a few days to break them in. Then go out for extended periods of time wearing them without socks to allow the heat to seep through and wick away moisture. Repeat this process several times over the next week or two, gradually increasing the duration of time you spend outdoors each day. Eventually, your boots should feel soft and supple, and you'll be able to wear them comfortably all day long without having to break them in any further.</p><h3>Are insulated winter boots worth it?</h3><p>Absolutely! Insulated winter boots are great because they keep your toes warm while also providing some protection against the elements. They also add up to 10 inches of waterproof material to your feet, so you can enjoy your time outside without worrying about water or snow getting into your boots. That being said, if you plan on doing any backcountry skiing, check out our article on waterproof breathable fabrics. Those materials will help keep your toes warm while also wicking sweat away from them to keep them dry.</p><h3>Are hiking boots and snow boots the same?</h3><p>Hiking boots and snow boots are not the same but have some similarities.

If you want to freshen up your sleeping bag, use mild soap and water.</p><h3>What is the best time to put a sleeping bag in the closet?</h3><p>The best time to put a sleeping bag away is when you're done using it. That way, it doesn't get all wrinkled and stuff like that. Also, if you have any moisture on it, it will evaporate, which can help preserve its insulating properties. If you don't care about those things, feel free to store it whenever you want. Just make sure you hang it somewhere dry and ventilate the room where it's stored to prevent mildew from forming. This is especially important for down sleeping bags, as mildew can ruin them over time. Make sure you keep an eye on your sleeping bag to ensure no moisture gets inside, as this can cause mildew to grow.</p><h3>How do I measure for a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Measure your height and chest girth (the distance between your nipples and belly button) and then add one size up for length and two inches for girth. For women with small chests, consider going one size smaller than usual. For men with large chests, go one size larger than usual. For women with short torsos, consider going one size shorter than usual. For men with long torsos, consider going one size longer than usual.</p><h3>How much does a good sleeping bag cost?</h3><div>Sleeping bags can cost anywhere from $50 to $1,000, but we think most people can get everything they need for car camping for $100, and for backpacking, between $150 and $400.</div><h3>How do I choose a sleeping bag?</h3><p>As a starting point, the best way to choose a sleeping bag is to ask yourself these two questions: In what environments and in what temperatures do I plan on camping? How often do I want to camp?Based on your answers to these questions, you should be able to narrow your field. If you plan to camp in environments that drop below 32 degrees F, getting a bag with a lower temperature rating than 32F is very important. If you plan for long-term camping trips, buying a bag that can easily dry is also very important. Lastly, if you plan to camp frequently, it's in your best interest to invest in a durable sleeping bag with proven performance and high-quality materials for its lining and insulation.</p>"
shooting ear protection,"<h2>FAQs about shooting ear protection</h2><h3>How do I choose the right hearing protection?</h3><p>The first thing to know is how much noise reduction you need. So, you have to measure the noise levels in your working environment and determine what kind of NRR you need. After that, you can look for the right NRR and pick a few models. Try them, if possible, and determine which one is the most comfortable and most convenient.</p><h3>What is the best material for ear defenders?</h3><p>Ear defenders (earmuffs and earplugs) are designed to protect the wearer's hearing from the excessive noise. The earplugs are made from foam, wax or silicone. The earmuffs usually have metal construction and headband frame, thermoplastic cups, and paddings made from acoustic foam that's supposed to absorb the sound.</p><h3>What is the best NRR rating for shooting?</h3><p>he majority of firearm calibers fire at 140 dB or more. For this reason, ear protection is essential when shooting. To bring down the noise to a level that is safe and comfortable, you need hearing protection that has an NRR rating ofn22 or greater.</p><h3>What should I look for when buying shooting earplugs?</h3><p>Look for earplugs that fit snugly into your ear without falling out or pressing against the ear canal. If you wear glasses, make sure they fit over the earplugs to avoid scratching or breaking your glasses. Also, look for earplugs with good sound reduction and low levels of noise transmission. These will help keep your hearing protected while also reducing the amount of unwanted noise that reaches your ears. Finally, look for earplugs that are easy to clean and maintain. This will ensure that they last as long as possible. Avoid earplugs that have large openings at the top or bottom. These allow more ambient noise to reach your ear than desired. Also, avoid earplugs that are overly bulky or uncomfortable. Make sure you get what works best for you. You'll be wearing them for hours on end, so make sure they're comfortable enough to use all day. If you plan to hunt in areas where there is a high risk of hearing loss, it may be worth investing in custom earplugs. Custom earplugs are made specifically for your ears and can cost anywhere from $200 to $300 for a pair. They're typically made from neoprene and include tips that extend beyond the ear canal to keep them from getting clogged by debris or water. They also come with several different tips and/or ear fins to help direct the flow of air and reduce noise entering your ear.</p><h3>How much do shooting earplugs cost?</h3><p>Shooting earplugs are available in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. The most common type is made from either rubber or silicone and costs between $15 and $20 for a pair.</p>"
tactical backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about tactical backpacks</h2><h3>How much protection do tactical backpacks offer?</h3><p>Backpacks designed specifically for military or law enforcement use usually include some sort of ballistic protection, along with internal padding and/or suspension systems to help absorb the force of an attacker's blows. Some commercial packs now come with stab guards and/or slash guards that protect the wearer from slashing and/or stabbing attacks. The more elaborate the protection, the pricier they tend to be, so keep that in mind when shopping. Also, don't forget to consider your environment when making a purchase. If you're going to be working in an urban area, you'll want something with additional layers of defense, like a pack with a hardshell exterior and stab-resistant lining, while someone who works in more rural areas might be fine with a simple nylon backpack.</p><h3>What Are Tactical Backpacks For?</h3><p>Tactical backpacks offer several different applications and purposes. Simply put, a tactical backpack is a specialized backpack that is durable, modular, and packed with useful features. Some tactical backpacks focus on hunting, with field medics using others. Tactical backpacks take after designs originating in the military, but not all tactical backpacks are for military personnel.</p><h3>What is the point of a tactical backpack?</h3><p>The primary purpose of a tactical backpack is to store your gear and make it easier to carry. Just as important, however, is how you get to your gear. There are many different access and opening styles a tactical backpack might have.</p><h3>What is the difference between MOLLE and PALS?</h3><p>With the MOLLE system, gear attachment is made simple, fast and easy - in fact, this was one of the main driving ideas behind the design. In summary essentiallyPALS is the webbing and MOLLE is the attachment. If you have PALS webbing you can use MOLLE attachments.</p><h3>What are the straps on military backpacks for?</h3><p>They are attached to the webbing by weaving the straps of each item into each other, creating a secure bond between your MOLLE pack or vest and the attachment. This guarantees your items will stay in reach at all times and will remain secure, staying in place and not jostling no matter your activity.</p><h3>How big is a tactical backpack?</h3><p>In most cases, the compartment size may range from about 35 to 45 liters. In some cases, the bag may also have an expandable pull string storage for more space. Still, you can find an extra-large tactical backpack with a capacity of approximately 150 liters suitable for a multiple-day trip</p>"
rechargeable flashlights,"<h2>FAQs on rechargeable flashlights</h2><h3>What is the difference between a flashlight and a lantern?</h3><p>A flashlight is designed to be held in one hand while performing tasks. A lantern, on the other hand, is designed to be hung from a hook or placed on a shelf, so it can be used for reading, watching TV, or any other task where you need illumination without being in danger of tripping over something or bumping into something.</p><h3>What is the perfect flashlight?</h3><p>The flashlight needs to fit the purpose you intend to use it in. Spend some time thinking about what your requirements are and how you plan to use your flashlight. In general, the perfect flashlight would have around 1,000 lumens, be lightweight, easily switched on and off with one hand, durable, waterproof, and feels comfortable in your hand.</p><h3>How do rechargeable flashlights work?</h3><p>Rechargeable flashlights use batteries you can plug in when their power runs out. Unlike disposable batteries, you can keep using the cell the light comes with. Usually, they take USB cables. Some allow for magnetic charging. Others use the same USB-C charger you use for your electronic devices.</p><h3>Is there a way to prevent shortened battery life?</h3><p>A great way to extend the life of your new battery is to completely charge it overnight before using it for the first time. This is called initializing and will give you the maximum capacity for the battery.</p><h3>How do I charge my flashlight?</h3><p>Your flashlight will have its own charging cord, but most will also accept AA batteries, which are commonly found in cell phone cases, and can be used as an off-the-shelf solution if you don't want to spring for the proprietary charger. If you're using alkaline batteries, make sure you change them out for fresh ones before fully discharging your flashlight. That said, I've never had a problem with running my flashlight down by half and then recharging it when I get home from work. It's not a bad way to manage power, especially if you use it often during the day and don't carry it around all night long. If you plan to take your flashlight camping, it's best to invest in a good quality lithium ion battery charger.</p>"
tactical pants,"<h2>FAQs on tactical pants</h2><h3>Who are tactical pants for?</h3><p>Anyone can wear tactical pants; however, they're intended for people who engage in activities that involve a lot of movement or that require a lot of tools. They're kind of like the utility knife of pants. That said, tactical pants are often worn by first responders, hikers, bikers, cyclists, trekkers, construction workers, military, and hunters.</p><h3>What is the difference between tactical and utility?</h3><p>Tactical clothing is designed for use by military personnel in a variety of demanding environments, while utility clothing is designed to withstand the rigors of more mundane tasks like yard work or mowing the lawn. The lines are often blurred, but generally speaking, if you're working with a rifle, you're wearing tactical gear; if you're doing light duty around the house, you're wearing utility.</p><h3>How tight should tactical pants be?</h3><p>Your body type will determine how tight your clothing needs to be. If you're athletic, you'll want something that's not too baggy, but not constricting. If you're less active, you can go with something looser and more comfortable. If you're pregnant, you'll want support from your clothing without restriction of movement. If you're just trying to hide something, you might want something tight enough to where it doesn't move when you walk, but not so tight as to restrict circulation. You may also want to consider wearing compression socks to help maintain heat and moisture inside your clothes. This will depend heavily on the environment you find yourself in, though.</p><h3>What is the most durable fabric for tactical pants?</h3><p>Durability varies greatly from brand to brand, but polyester tends to hold up better than cotton, especially against the elements. Cotton is great for lighter-duty wear, but polyester works for everything from patrolling to working out in the field. Cotton blends like poly/cotton gabardine are also very popular and offer a nice mix of durability and comfort. They won't last forever, but they'll hold up well against the elements and can be laundered relatively easily.</p><h3>What pants do U.S. special operations forces wear?</h3><p>This is a tough question to answer because there are special operator units in every branch of the military. In general, military special operators will wear their battle dress uniforms, some other issued uniform, or whatever their mission requires.</p>"
throwing knives,"<h2>FAQs about throwing knives</h2><h3>How do you throw a knife?</h3><p>The best way to learn how to throw a knife is to watch someone who knows how to do it well. You can also practice at home, but don't expect to be able to hit a target from more than 10 feet away. It's a lot of fun, though, so give it a try.</p><h3>What are the benefits of throwing knives?</h3><p>Throwing knives are great for self-defense and close quarters combat because they're easy to conceal, lightweight, and have a sharpened edge that can cause serious injury or death if used against an attacker. They also make great training weapons for use in martial arts, as they're easy to hold steady while moving, and can deliver a powerful blow to your opponent's body or head. The drawback is that they lack range, so you'll need to keep them handy when you anticipate needing them, and practice with something non-toxic like a foam rubber block or glove to avoid injuring yourself or your loved ones. Also, knives aren't designed for hunting, so you won't get much use out of them for food unless you plan on going into survival mode.</p><h3>How effective are throwing knives for self-defense?</h3><p>It depends. If you are alone and facing a single attacker, then yes, you probably could take him down with one or two good throws. But if you are outnumbered, then you might want to look at other options, such as firearms, which are far less likely to be misused in a self-defense scenario. Still, if you are confident enough in your ability to stick a guy with a thrown knife, then go ahead and give it a shot.</p><h3>Can any knife be a throwing knife?</h3><p>Technically, yes. That said, if you want to hit your target with any degree of consistency or accuracy, skip the Bowie knife, the karambit, and any other knife that isn't built for throwing. Your knives will also last longer if you go with a purpose-built blade since traditional knives break more easily during high-speed impacts with solid objects.</p><h3>How much do throwing knives cost?</h3><p>A good quality throwing knife usually runs around $10 a pop, but since most purpose-built throwing knives come in sets of three or more, you can expect to drop somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 for a decent set.</p>"
skinning knives,"<h2>FAQs on skinning knives</h2><h3>How sharp should a skinning knife be?</h3><p>Sharpness is relative to your use. If you plan on skinning animals, you'll want something with a keen edge for clean cuts and minimal blood loss. If you're going to peel potatoes or carrots, you can get away with something that's not razor-sharp.</p><h3>What size should a skinning knife be?</h3><p>Skinning knives come in a variety of sizes, from small pocketknives like the Kershaw KK-720 to large utility knives like the Gerber LMF II. The best way to determine what works best for you is to try out a few different knives and see which one feels comfortable in your hand. You may find that a smaller knife works better for you than a larger one. That said, don't go too small because you won't have enough control over the blade when performing tricky tasks like filleting an animal or peeling vegetables. Stick with knives between 8 and 12 inches for most jobs.</p><h3>What should I look for in a skinning knife?</h3><p>The main attribute to look for in a skinning knife is a drop-point blade, or one that drops to the tip, whether in a folding or fixed-blade design. Drop-point knives tend to have thicker tips for better control, and are less prone to piercing the hide. Second, make sure the handle fits your hand, and is neither too unwieldy and large nor too tediously small. Within those constraints, there are hundreds of models from which to choose.</p><h3>What should I expect to pay for a good hunting knife?</h3><p>""Good"" is a subjective term, but we recommend starting your search around the $100 mark. That's where you'll start to see better types of steel and manufacturing practices. The sky's the limit, but our picks fall between $100 and $300.</p><h3>What makes a good hunting knife?</h3><p>A good hunting knife is one that can get the job done and make your life easier. That might mean a precise blade that can delicately dress a dove in the field or a bushcraft knife that can just as easily break down an elk as split firewood. Buy what works for you, not someone else.</p><h3>Can I use a folding knife for hunting?</h3><p>You sure can. Some of our favorite folding knives are made for hunting. Assuming size isn't an issue, the main drawback is the amount of cleaning that's required afterward. We'd rather not disassemble a folding knife to get it clean if we don't have to.</p>"
camping stoves,"<h2>FAQs about camping stoves</h2><h3>How much does a camping stove cost?</h3><p>Most budget-minded stoves cost between $150 and $250. Mid-tier models cost between $250 and $350, while high-end units cost between $350 and $500.</p><h3>What fuel do most campers use?</h3><p>Most budget-minded stoves are designed to operate on white gas (propane), which costs around $30 per tank at most hardware stores. High-end stoves can run on a variety of fuels including white gas, natural gas, propane, and even butane. Most high-end stoves also include an integrated digital fuel gauge that displays the current amount of fuel in your tank and how much is left. The more expensive the stove, the better its fuel efficiency will be compared to other options.</p><h3>What stove is best for cooking actual food?</h3><p>The stove that is best is one that you can get a proper pot or pan on top of, has sufficient BTU output, can simmer, and has enough of a flame distribution to avoid hot spots and scorching. Generally, these are car camping/basecamp stoves.</p><h3>Are multi-fuel stoves difficult to use?</h3><p>Not typically. Some require you to change a small part of the burner depending on the fuel. If so, it's not hard.</p><h3>I'm going to travel. Which type of stove would be best?</h3><p>It depends. If traveling by foot and backpack, get a backpacking stove. By car? Then get a car camping stove. If by air, check to see what the airline will allow aboard and what fuels are available at your destination. They typically don't let you fly with fuel.</p><h3>Can you use a camping stove indoors?</h3><p>I don't advise it, especially not inside a tent. You could asphyxiate, which is bad. These stoves put out carbon monoxide which can kill you if you inhale too much of it.</p><h3>How hot does a camp stove Get?</h3><p>Most burners can reach temperatures up to 400 degrees F, while some are higher depending on the size of the stove.</p>"
walkie talkies,"<h2>FAQs about walkie-talkies</h2><h3>How much do walkie-talkies cost?</h3><p>Walkie-Talkies are usually sold in sets of two, and can cost as little as $15 for a set that doesn't include earbuds or headphones. If you want to use your walkie-talkie for hands-free communication while working out, expect to pay between $30 and $50 for a quality set of earbuds or headphones.</p><h3>What is the best time to buy a walkie-talkie?</h3><p>The best time to buy a walkie-talkie is when they go on sale. That's because manufacturers tend to slash their prices during Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. However, if you're looking for something specific, it might be better to wait until after Christmas to avoid the crowds. Also, keep an eye out for military surplus deals, which often have better features than new-production models and can be had for dirt cheap. These deals are great for those who need something ruggedized for work or play, but don't want to spend a fortune. I recommend buying a secondary radio just in case the one you get isn't what you were expecting. It's also a good idea to get a spare battery and/or earbud/headphone adapter. You'll thank me later.</p><h3>What's the difference between VHF and UHF radios?</h3><p>Radio frequencies are classified by their wavelength. VHF (very high frequency) radios use wavelengths between 30 and 300 megahertz and are useful in unobstructed outdoor settings. UHF (ultra-high frequency) radios operate between 300 and 3,000 megahertz and provide a higher quality signal.</p><h3>What features do I need to consider when buying a walkie-talkie?</h3><p>A: Which walkie talkie you choose depends on what you plan to use it for. Some things to consider are waterproofing, texting, GPS capabilities, and the number of channels your radio comes programmed with.</p><h3>How much range do I need?</h3><p>The useable range of most walkie talkies is pretty limited -- typically less than a mile. It's possible to get better results, but going much further requires a license. Becoming a licensed radio operator isn't expensive and it opens the doors to higher quality radios.</p>"
coolers for camping,"<h2>FAQs on coolers for camping</h2><h3>Why is bringing a cooler important?</h3><p>Coolers are your best bet for keeping drinks cool during the summer. They're also critical if you bring raw meat to cook at your campsite. Meat and dairy need to be refrigerated to prevent foodborne illness. We recommend throwing in a thermometer so you can monitor the interior temperature.</p><h3>How do you pack a cooler?</h3><p>It depends. If you're car camping, pack your food and drinks in the main compartment of the cooler, then put a small ice pack or frozen gel packs inside to keep things cold longer.</p><h3>What's the best way to fill a cooler?</h3><p>Pack your food and drinks first. It's not a bad idea to put packages of uncooked meat on the bottom, just in case they leak. Cold air is heavy, so pack ice on top of your food to get the most out of it. Don't skimp on the ice, either. Stack it as thick as you can.</p><h3>What size cooler should I get?</h3><p>This depends heavily on how many people will be using it and what they are packing in their cooler. If you plan to bring a lot of perishable foods, you'll want a larger cooler. If you only plan to bring beverages and snacks, a smaller one may suffice.</p><h3>How can I take care of my camping cooler?</h3><p>You obviously want to protect your cooler against impacts. In between uses, give it a thorough scrubbing with mild dish soap and warm water. That should be all it takes to keep your cooler fresh and ready for the next trip.</p><h3>How much do camping coolers cost?</h3><p>While the styrofoam coolers from the store only cost a couple dollars, a high-end camping cooler that will last for years (and cause a heck of a lot less damage to the environment) typically ranges from $200 to $500.</p>"
long range scopes,"<h2>FAQs on long range scopes</h2><h3>What is a good long-range scope for a rifle?</h3><p>This somewhat depends on what one means by ""long-range."" That said, most long-distance shooters would be wise to find a reliable scope that features a 5-20x magnification range, first focal plane MRAD or grid-style reticle, and fully coated lenses.</p><h3>What scope can see the farthest?</h3><p>Right now, the most powerful conventional riflescope you can buy is the March X-Series 8-80x56mm scope. Featuring a 34mm main tube and 56mm objective lens, this offers a true 10-times zoom ratio and up to 80X magnification.</p><h3>How much magnification is needed for long-range shooting?</h3><p>Depending on your caliber and shooting application, a good long-range scope will have a magnification range of around 5-20x. This range should provide plenty of power for almost any long-range shooting application.</p><h3>What magnification is best for long range shooting?</h3><p>2.5-10x is a good minimum out west, and if you intend to do any long-range shooting on the side, we'd suggest going with a scope that at least has an exposed elevation turret 4-16x, 6-24x or anywhere in between is a solid place to be.</p><h3>What magnification do I need for 500 yards?</h3><p>Magnification is perhaps the most important thing a scope does. At 500 yards, you will need a magnification of at least 5x, and you may want to go as high as 10x. Some of this depends on what you intend to shoot. If you are shooting small targets, you'll want a greater magnification to help you find them.</p>"
first aid kits,"<h2>FAQs about first aid kits</h2><h3>What should I look for in a first aid kit?</h3><p>First aid kits are designed to help you deal with injuries and illnesses that don't require medical attention, but could become infected if not treated properly. They typically include adhesive bandages, gauze pads, alcohol wipes, and other essentials to keep you from getting sick or bleeding profusely. Make sure yours includes enough supplies to meet your needs before an emergency arises.</p><h3>Are there any first aid kit regulations I should be aware of?</h3><p>To my knowledge, there are no regulations on first aid kits. That said, there are plenty of laws and other restrictions surrounding the administration of first aid. The most significant are Good Samaritan laws and laws restricting who can administer medications in an emergency.</p><h3>What are 3 considerations regarding a first aid kit?</h3><p>First aid is of vital importance, as it can preserve life, prevent further injury or ill health, and promote recovery. These are known as the three Ps of first aid.</p><h3>Do first aid kits expire?</h3><p>No, but some components may need to be replaced from time to time. Most over-the-counter medications never expire; however, they will slowly lose potency over the years. Bandages and dressings require dry, sealed packages to maintain their sterile integrity. Gel packets, alcohol wipes, and similar supplies will eventually dry out over time and need to be replaced every so often.</p><h3>How often should a first aid kit be checked?</h3><p>The official advise from medics is that your first aid kit should be checked once every three months, with the main checks being: review expiry dates, replace used equipment, clean the inside of the box and remind yourself what is in your first aid kit and how to use it.</p><h3>Where should I keep a first aid kit?</h3><p>Wherever you think you'll need one. In your glove box, under your sink, just keep it easily accessible. Personally, I carry one with me everywhere I go, but then again, I'm weird like that.</p>"
survival knives,"<h2>FAQs about survival knives</h2><h3>What makes a survival knife good for self-defense?</h3><p>Survival knives are designed to perform multiple functions, including utility tasks like opening packages or cutting firewood, and defensive tasks like disabling an attacker's hands or feet, or severing their air supply with a stab to the neck or throat. They're also built tough enough to take a beating without breaking or chipping. And they're small enough to conceal easily if desired.</p><h3>Is it legal to carry a survival knife?</h3><p>That depends on your locality. Certain states prohibit the concealed carry of fixed blade knives, or knives over certain lengths. In general, these are knives intended for use in the wilderness, and most places in the world have exceptions in their knife laws for good reason, which is usually satisfied by being on a hiking or camping trip. As always, know your local laws.</p><h3>How much does a survival knife usually cost?</h3><p>A survival knife can range from $30 to $200, depending on the quality of steel used and the amount of customizing done. The best value is probably going to be somewhere in between those two numbers.</p><h3>What is jimping?</h3><p>Jimping is the name for serrations on the spine of the knife, which allow you to get greater control of the knife when performing delicate tasks such as whittling or cleaning an animal. They allow you to get a grip on the spine of the blade with your thumb.</p><h3>How thick should a survival knife be?</h3><p>Generally speaking, knives that are 4mm in thickness or greater at the spine are going to be able to stand up to the kind of high-impact use that's required to strip branches, baton logs, and chop wood. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and the thickness can also be dependent on factors such as blade length, intended use, and blade steel. Making the blade too thick can add unnecessary weight or make the knife minimally useful for cleaning animals or cutting vegetables.</p>"
10x42 binoculars,"<h2>FAQs on 10x42 binoculars</h2><h3>What magnification do 10x42 binoculars offer?</h3><p>10x magnification is roughly equal to the size of a human eye at ten feet. At forty-two inches, the 10x40 binoculars will be large enough for most any use, from hunting to birding to observing sports at a distance.</p><h3>How much does a set of 10x42 binoculars cost?</h3><p>A good pair of binoculars can cost anywhere between $250 and $500 depending on features and quality. A premium set of binoculars like the Nikon Monarch 8x42 binoculars will easily break $600. Premium brands like these are built to last and are designed to withstand the rigors of field work or serious recreational use. They're also made from tougher materials that won't scratch or mar when dropped. If you plan to keep your binoculars in a case, make sure it's one that specifically fits this model of binoculars. Otherwise, you'll have to take care of the scratches yourself.</p><h3>What are 10x42 binoculars good for?</h3><p>10x42 means the binoculars have 10x magnification power (compared to the naked eye) and 42mm objective lens diameter. 10x42 are best for things like bird watching, hunting, concerts, sports events, etc, because they have high magnification, good light quality, and yet are still easy to hold steady.</p><h3>How do you know if binoculars are powerful?</h3><p>Model numbers on binoculars essentially tell you their strength (magnification power) and size (objective lens diameter). In 8x42 binoculars, for example, ""8"" is the magnification power and ""42"" is the diameter (in millimeters) of the objective lenses (the lenses closest to the object you're viewing).</p><h3>How far can you see with 10x binoculars?</h3><p>With a 10 power binocular, the trees will appear as if you're only 10 yards versus what the tree line would look like with your unaided eye. Basically teleporting you 90 yards closer for a more detailed look. A deer will appear ten times larger through the 10x binocular than with your normal eyesight.</p>"
1911 holsters,"<h2>FAQs on 1911 holsters</h2><h3>What makes a 1911 different from other handguns?</h3><p>The most obvious difference between the 1911 and other handguns is the grip angle. The 1911 has a shorter grip angle than most other pistols, making it more comfortable for right-handed shooters to fire offhand.</p><h3>How tight should my 1911 holster be?</h3><p>Your holster should fit snugly enough so that your firearm doesn't rattle around inside of it when you draw or don't have it loose enough so that your trigger finger can slip off the trigger guard and allow the hammer to fall if you're not careful. If you wear a glove, make sure it fits snugly over the backstrap of your gun before wearing it with a holster. If you wear a wrap, make sure it's tight enough where your weapon won't fall out when you sit down. Make sure you practice drawing from the holster in an emergency situation to ensure you can get your weapon out quickly in a self-defense scenario.</p><h3>How safe is a 1911 cocked and locked?</h3><p>Without sounding too flippant, a gun is only as safe as its user. However, if you do choose to carry with a round in the chamber, riding the hammer forward so it needs to be reset before a trigger pull can give you the speed you want in a self-defense situation while lowering the risk of an accidental discharge.</p><h3>Are belly holsters good?</h3><p>Belly band holsters are perfect for anyone who needs the extra security knowing they have strong retention around their entire waist. These are also best for those who have trouble concealing handguns in their waistband because of the type of clothing they like to wear.</p><h3>What size holster do you need for a 1911?</h3><p>Whatever best fits your model of firearm. Regardless of what you choose, make sure it's comfortable and can hold your weapon safely with the hammer in either position.</p>"
in wall gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about in-wall gun safes</h2><h3>What is the most secure way to store a firearm?</h3><p>The safest way to store a firearm is unloaded and locked away from ammunition. That being said, if you live in an area that's regularly patrolled by the ATF or FBI, it might be best to keep your firearms loaded and secured away from ammo in a hard case.</p><h3>How can I hide my wall safe?</h3><p>Ever watch mystery thrillers or shows with elaborate supervillains holed up in mega-mansions? The right in-wall safe makes the perfect storage solution to hide behind TVs or picture frames. Some rifle safes can be stowed behind easy-to-maneuver bookshelves or curtains. Even try behind clothes hung up in your closet.</p><h3>Would it be worth it to buy a wall safe?</h3><p>The main advantage of wall safes is that they cannot be easily accessed by burglars, so when they are concealed properly, they offer excellent protection from burglars. Installing a wall safe requires an installer to have a background check, be bonded, and hold sufficient insurance coverage.</p><h3>How deep is a wall safe?</h3><p>Aside from a small number of ""deep"" wall safes, most wall safes measure between three to six inches deep, just enough to fit in most walls without protruding out or intruding on possible pipes or wiring. Deeper wall safes can stretch to 10 inches.</p><h3>What is the cost of an in-wall safe?</h3><p>It is possible to purchase a wall-mounted safe for $50 to $1,100 or more. Despite their ease of concealment, installation may be challenging. Getting them to fit in your wall will require a custom build, which will increase the cost of installation.</p><h3>Can you bolt a safe to the wall?</h3><p>In most cases, yes. Most in-wall safes will be sold with some form of mounting hardware in the form of either screws or bolts. In a few cases, some larger long gun safes may rely on their heft and their placement between the studs to resist movement and prying.</p>"
rooftop cargo carriers,"<h2>FAQs about rooftop cargo carriers</h2><h3>How heavy can a rooftop carrier be?</h3><p>Rooftop carriers are designed to carry loads between 15 and 25 pounds. Anything over that will require you to use the two-person version of the carrier, or some other type of lift system.</p><h4>Can a roof box overhang?</h4><p>It is not advisable. If the box hangs over in the back, then you're at risk of hitting the back gate/door.</p><h3>What is the best time to load/unload my car with a rooftop carrier?</h3><p>The best time to load/unload your car with a rooftop carrier is when you're stopped at a light or stop sign. Avoid loading/unloading during high speeds or while driving downhill. The carrier won't do its job if it's not secure on the roof, so make sure you put it up there before you start moving. If you're worried about thieves, remember that the carrier itself is made out of plastic and doesn't have any moving parts. It's also possible to bolt the carrier directly to the frame of your vehicle instead of the roof, which may provide better protection against theft and impact. Be sure to get the right size carrier for your vehicle, though.</p><h4>Do roof boxes increase fuel consumption?</h4><p>It seems that smaller cars are impacted more, but adding anything to the top of your vehicle is bound to impact your fuel economy.</p><h3>What is the difference between roof rails and roof racks?</h3><p>The main difference between the two is the direction these are mounted on top of the roof of your vehicles. For example, roof rails run along the length of a car's roof attached by feet or other mounts, and roof racks are mounted across the roof.</p><h3>What are the carriers on top of cars called?</h3><p>A roof rack is a set of bars secured to the roof of a motor car. It is used to carry bulky items such as luggage, bicycles, canoes, kayaks, skis, or various carriers and containers.</p>"
binoculars for long distance,"<h2>FAQs on binoculars for long distance</h2><h3>What magnification should I get?</h3><p>Magnification is a measure of how many times the image appears enlarged when you look through the binoculars. The higher the number, the greater the magnification. Magnifications range from 8x to 40x, with 10x being a good middle-of-the-road magnification.</p><h3>How much do binoculars cost?</h3><p>Binoculars can be expensive, but there are plenty of budget options available that offer excellent performance and value. For instance, the Bushnell Trophy X7 offers seven high-power lenses in one package for $250. The Leupold VX-R is another great option, offering 12x magnification and a wide field of view for $350. The Schmidt Bender PMX is an affordable entry-level binocular that's tough enough for hunting while still being lightweight enough for everyday use. It has eight fixed lenses and a rubberized coating to help repel water and dirt. The only downside is its lack of zoom, so you'll have to decide if that's a feature you want in your binoculars or not.</p><h3>How much does binocular magnification affect picture quality?</h3><p>The more magnification you have, the better the image will appear. However, the increased magnification also increases the cost of the binoculars, so it's important to find a balance between price and quality that works for your needs. If you plan to take pictures of wildlife, you might want to go with something like the Nikon Monarch 80x or the Zeiss Victory Vision 80x. If you just want to see what's around you, you could probably get away with something like the Bushnell Elite 8.</p><h3>What are the best sizes of binoculars for general use?</h3><p>You can go for a 10x magnification power for general use. But depending on the quality that you expect, a 20x magnification can also be used for casual bird watching, hunting, or hiking.</p><h3>How do I choose binocular magnification?</h3><p>8x to 10x is usually enough for birdwatching or hiking. While for better results at night, more magnification power will be better. Also, up to 20x or 25x magnification is mostly used for terrestrial observations.</p>"
solar panels for camping,"<h2>FAQs on solar panels for camping</h2><h3>What size do I need?</h3><p>The size of your roof will determine how many watts you can generate. If you have a small camper or car tent, get a 10-watt panel; if you're going to be setting up a larger RV or trailer, get a 20-watt panel.</p><h3>How much power does a typical 12V battery pack provide?</h3><p>A typical 12V battery pack provides about 1 hour of run time. That's enough to power a small flashlight or cell phone charger, but not enough to power an entire campsite. You'll want to look at the specs for the exact amount of run time provided by each battery pack. Also, note that the more heavily discharged a battery is, the less useful it is as a power source. Avoid leaving your batteries in any state where they could potentially overheat and explode. Keep them fully charged when possible, and away from water and heat sources. If you are unsure, consult with a certified electrician or battery expert before attempting any sort of modification or installation. It's also important to remember that the sun doesn't shine all the time, so don't rely on it as your only power source. Make sure you have a backup plan in case the sun goes down.</p><h3>What size solar panel is good for camping?</h3><p>It depends on what you need to charge, how much power you need, and how fast you need it to charge. In general, the greater the demand, the bigger the panel you'll need in terms of watts produced.</p><h3>What will a 200-watt solar panel cost?</h3><p>About $200 to $250 for most 200W panels.</p><h3>How long does a portable solar panel last?</h3><p>This depends on the amount of abuse the panel takes. Generally speaking, panels are designed to last 20 to 30 years, but they degrade over time. The National Renewable Energy Lab found that, on average, solar panel output falls by 0.8 percent each year.</p>"
owb holsters,"<h2>FAQs on owb holsters</h2><h3>How do you wear an OWB holster?</h3><p>The most important thing is to practice your draw stroke. Practice it with a mirror or some other reflective surface in front of you, and then practice it without the mirror, just relying on muscle memory. Make sure you can get a clear sight picture before drawing.</p><h3>What makes an OWB holster uncomfortable?</h3><p>An uncomfortable holster will feel tight against your body and/or rub against sensitive areas like your belly button or thigh bone. An uncomfortable holster also may move around during use, especially if you wear compression-style underwear. If this happens, you could lose control of your firearm, which could cause injury or death to yourself or others. Avoid wearing tight clothing that rides up over your belt line, and make sure you practice your draw stroke regularly to ensure you can maintain control of your firearm while drawing from the holster. Also, avoid wearing anything made of leather, as leather holsters tend to be more comfortable than plastic ones, but they're not nearly as reliable for retention during a violent encounter. Finally, avoid wearing girth bands or any sort of device that might dig into your flesh and prevent you from drawing your weapon quickly in an emergency.</p><h3>Is it legal to use an OWB holster?</h3><p>Yep, completely legal. However, competitions might have specific requirements.</p><h3>Can I wear an OWB holster with my dress pants?</h3><p>Yes, but you'll want to practice your draw stroke first. You should also avoid wearing anything tight that rides up over your belt line, and make sure you practice your draw stroke regularly to ensure you can maintain control of your firearm while drawing from the holster. Leather holsters are best suited for outdoor activities, but they're certainly not uncomfortable to wear in the office, provided you practice your draw stroke regularly and wear something light and breathable underneath.</p>"
hunting knives,"<h2>FAQs about hunting knives</h2><h3>How much should a hunting knife weigh?</h3><p>A good hunting knife should feel comfortable in your hand and be able to deliver a solid, accurate strike at close range. That being said, there are so many different types of hunters out there that it's impossible for us to say what the ""right"" weight is for any given type of hunt. If you're new to hunting, stick with something lighter.</p><h3>What makes a hunting knife special?</h3><p>Hunting knives are designed to perform specific tasks in the field. For example, some are designed specifically for skinning animals while others are designed for cleaning and dressing game or opening packages. The list goes on and on, but most hunting knives will have either a serrated edge or a plain edge for cutting through tough hide and muscle, and a thumb stud for secure grip during use. Some high-end knives even come with leather sheaths for added protection and carrying options. Also, keep in mind that the quality of the steel used to make the knife will affect its durability and how sharp it stays over time.&nbsp;</p><h3>What makes a good hunting knife?</h3><p>A good hunting knife is one that can get the job done and make your life easier. That might mean a precise blade that can delicately dress a dove in the field or a bushcraft knife that can just as easily break down an elk as split firewood. Buy what works for you, not someone else.</p><h3>Are hunting knives legal everywhere?</h3><p>Yes, but check your local laws before heading into the field. In general, if you're camping or otherwise away from your vehicle, you can take whatever knives you want, but if you plan to carry them on your person, you'll need to get a concealed weapons permit first.</p><h3>What should I expect to pay for a good hunting knife?</h3><p>Good is a subjective term, but we recommend starting your search around the $100 mark. That's where you'll start to see better types of steel and manufacturing practices. The sky's the limit, but our picks fall between $100 and $300.</p>"
weighted vests,"<h2>FAQs on weighted vests</h2><h3>How do I wear a weighted vest?</h3><p>Wear the vest as you would any other athletic supporter. Make sure it's comfortable and secure, and that the weight evenly distributes across your shoulders and chest.</p><h3>Is a weighted vest good for losing weight?</h3><p>Yes, but the vest is only part of the answer. A weighted vest will help you burn more calories in whatever activity you're doing, but keep in mind that weight loss is primarily diet-driven. If calories burnt is greater than calories consumed, you'll lose weight. Long story short, you can't up your food intake to match your exertion.</p><h3>What is the best time to wear a weighted vest?</h3><p>The best time to wear a weighted vest is when you're working out in the morning before your workout has warmed up. The added resistance will help keep you from over-extending and risking injury. If you plan on doing HIIT workouts or any kind of high intensity interval training (HIIT) then definitely get yourself one of these bad boys outfitted with the right level of resistance for your activity. It'll help you maintain proper posture and technique while keeping your heart rate elevated for longer periods of time. As always, consult with a medical professional if you have any concerns about wearing a weighted vest during exercise.</p><h3>What exercises can I perform wearing a weight vest?</h3><p>You can perform pretty much any type of exercise in a weighted vest, but you want to make sure you're smart about what you're doing. For example, running with large amounts of weight can be detrimental to your back and joints, especially if you don't build up appropriately. High impact, repetitious activities might be better served with lower weights and a good long build-up period.</p><h3>How heavy should a weighted vest be?</h3><p>The load of your weight vest should really depend on your activity and fitness level. Lighter vests with less material are ideal for cardio activities, while heavier vests with a higher weight capacity are better for strengthening workouts. For beginners just getting started with weighted vests for walking and other cardio activities, stick with one that's 5 to 10 percent of your body weight.</p>"
bore sight,"<h2>FAQs on bore sights</h2><h3>What is a bore sight?</h3><p>A bore sight is a device that allows you to accurately measure and adjust the length of your rifle's barrel without removing it from the stock. The most common type is the dot matrix bore-sight reticle, which has two or three dots in a pattern that matches the distance between the rear sight and the muzzle end of the barrel.</p><h3>How do I install a bore sight?</h3><p>Follow the directions provided by the manufacturer. Most manufacturers provide clear instructions for installation. If not, there are several YouTube videos available that show how to install a variety of types of bore-sight reticles. Make sure you get a proper fit before taking off any rounds with the reticle installed. Otherwise, you could risk damaging your firearm.</p><h3>What is the best distance to bore sight a rifle?</h3><p>Most shooters agree that 1 inch low at 25 yards is the magic number for most rifles with a sight height above bore of 1.5in - 2in. At this point, you are ready to sight-in at 100 yards.</p><h3>How accurate are bore sights?</h3><p>First,they are a far more precise method than using your eye. While visually bore sighting a firearm may get you on paper at 100 yards, laser bore sighting will put you much closer to center and will require less ammo in the long run when zeroing the rifle.</p><h3>Can you zero with bore sight?</h3><p>The easiest way to adjust a zero is using a bore sight method. Once a weapon is bore sighted it means that it is ""on Paper"" but it will still need some minor adjustments. Bore sighting will get your weapon close to target but not perfect, regardless if you use the traditional method or use a laser bore sight.</p><h3>How does a bore sight work?</h3><p>Modern laser bore sights make the job of sighting in a rifle or handgun with a scope or open sights very easy. The laser bore sight fits into the chamber of the firearm. Once the laser is turned on, the firearm is aimed at the target and the scope or sights are aligned to aim at the laser dot on the target.</p>"
spotting scopes,"<h2>FAQs on spotting scopes</h2><h3>What magnification do you need?</h3><p>The answer to this question depends on what you plan to use the scope for. If you're a hunter, then you'll want something with at least 10x magnification, while if you're a nature photographer, you might be fine with less than 10x.</p><h3>What makes a spotting scope good for hunting?</h3><p>Spotting scopes allow hunters to see far beyond what's possible with the naked eye, binoculars, or a rifle scope. They allow much better target identification and can scan distant terrain much more effectively than less-powerful optics.</p><h3>How much does a spotting scope cost?</h3><p>Spotting scopes can range from $150 to over $600, depending on features and quality of glass used. The best way to find out how much your desired optic will cost is to go to a store that sells them, look around, and haggle a little. Most retailers won't budge on price once they've locked it in with an order, so don't be shy about asking for a better deal. That said, we found the Nikon Monarch VX-80V spotting scope to be one of the most affordable optics on our list that still performed well. It retails for $250 and comes with a lifetime guarantee against breakage or defects. That's pretty good value for the money.</p><h3>What is a spotting scope used for?</h3><p>Spotting scopes are used to see accurately at great distances. Hunters and wildlife tour guides use them to observe and identify animals without disturbing them. At the range, spotting scopes allow shooters to evaluate their shot placement without leaving the bench.</p><h3>What should I look for in a spotting scope?</h3><p>Look for an objective lens of at least 60 mm in diameter to provide a bright image. If you want to do a lot of digiscoping, you'll want your scope to deliver the brightest image possible to your camera. Look for an objective lens around 85 mm. Beware of cheap spotting scopes</p>"

The Bowie knife's versatility makes it an excellent choice for EDC (everyday carry) situations.</p><h3>How much does a Bowie cost?</h3><p>Because Bowie knives require more materials, they tend to cost more than smaller knives. Most mid-tier Bowies can cost anywhere from $100 to $300. The price increases with better materials, quality control, warranty, etc. However, the sky's the limit with custom knives made with exotic materials and handmade blades.</p><h3>Is a Bowie knife illegal?</h3><p>At one point in time, Bowies were illegal in several states, but only a handful today still have restrictions on Bowies. Most of those merely prohibit conceal-carrying a Bowie, or prohibit minors and felons from owning them. For more information on state knife laws, check out the legal guide on.</p><h3>What is special about a Bowie knife?</h3><p>The Bowie knife's design also lends itself to use as a hunting knife for skinning or butchering game.

If you plan to carry more than 35 pounds, get a bigger pack. If you plan to carry less than 35 pounds, get a smaller pack. If you plan to carry anything in between, get an MOLLE compatible pack. These packs can accept MOLLE pouches, plates, or accessories, and they are designed to fit over 60 liters of gear. They also have integrated compression straps to help keep your load secure while in motion.</p><h3>What is typically in a bug out bag?</h3><p>Bug-out bags vary among survivalists, but in general, bug-out bags will carry key essential items such as a first aid kit, chargers, a water bottle, and a survival knife for protection in a wide range of emergency scenarios.</p><h3>What is the number one survival tool?</h3><p>A fire starter is perhaps the single most important survival tool you can have in your kit, because it will help you cook food, boil water, stay warm, and sleep safely without worrying about predators.</p><h3>How long should a bug out bag last?</h3><p>A bug out bag is a portable emergency kit that should last you for 72-hours. They're also known as 72-hour kits, grab bags or Go Bags.

camelbak,"<h2>FAQs on camelbak</h2><h3>What is the best time to hydrate with a CamelBak?</h3><p>Drink when you're thirsty, not when you think you should be hydrating. If you wait until your thirst quenching threshold is met, you'll likely over-hydrate and risk cramping or worse. Stick with small sips throughout the day, especially before and after workouts. You can also use the included water bladder as a guide to how much water you need each day. The bladder will fill automatically when empty.</p><h3>How do I refill the hydration bladder?</h3><p>If you are refilling it at a large sink, connect the hose to the tap for a refill. However, if you are filling it from a shallow sink or a lake, you have to remove the hydration bladder from the bag and disconnect the drinking tube for an easier time refilling it. Consider wiping it with a paper towel before stashing it in the backpack.</p><h3>Can I wear a CamelBak while working out?</h3><p>Yes, but you may want to rethink that. The reservoir inside the CamelBak is open at the top, so if you were to fall during a vigorous workout, there would be no way to break your fall without injuring yourself. Also, the shoulder straps could dig into your shoulders and cause you to lose form and momentum, which could lead to injury. Instead, stick to sports like swimming, running, and rowing machines, which don't have moving parts and therefore won't affect your technique. If you must do something strenuous, go with an insulated bottle instead.</p><h3>Are hydration backpacks hygienic?</h3><p>Yes. It's similar to carrying water in a water bottle. You just need to remember to clean it regularly and keep the drinking tube free of contamination. The water bladder can get pretty funky if not cleaned for weeks. Also, make sure the bladder is BPA-free before you use it.</p><h3>How much does a CamelBak cost?</h3><p>The price of a good quality CamelBak will vary depending on materials, features and where you buy it. Expect to pay between $100 and $150 for a basic model, with more elaborate options costing up to $200 more.</p>"
bivy sack,"<h2>FAQs on bivy sacks</h2><h3>How do you put on a bivy sack?</h3><p>The best way to put on a bivy is to lay it out flat, pull the cord at the neck to tighten it around your neck, and then zip up the side zippers. Make sure you get the right size for your height before doing this, or use a measuring tape to check if you're getting too tight or loose.</p><h3>What are the benefits of a bivy sack?</h3><p>A bivy is great for keeping the elements out while you're sleeping. It also helps insulate you from the cold ground, making it easier to stay warm during winter months. And, because they're waterproof, they can help keep you dry in wet weather. They also allow you to regulate your body temperature by venting heat or moisture from inside the shell to the outside, which can be useful when camping in colder climes. They also help protect you from potential animal bites or scratches, so they're a good choice for outdoor adventures where you might be exposed to wildlife. They also help maintain your body's core temperature, which can make a big difference in how comfortable you feel while sleeping.</p><h3>Are bivy bags waterproof?</h3><p>Just larger than your sleeping bag and mattress, bivies are typically constructed of waterproof or water-resistant materials to shield against wind and precipitation. Originally developed as emergency shelters, today bivy sacks and bivy shelters come in a range of styles.</p><h3>What does bivy stand for?</h3><p>slang:a small tent or shelter.</p><h3>Are bivy sack warmer than tents?</h3><p>Tents are colder- Because of all of the extra space in your tent, heat more easily escapes.

headlamps,"<h2>FAQs on headlamps</h2><h3>How much do headlamps cost?</h3><p>Headlamps are sold in a variety of price ranges, but most fall between $30 and $50. Higher-end models can easily reach $100 or more.</p><h3>Why do some headlamps have different color lenses?</h3><p>White lights are by far the most common because they produce true-to-life colors. Other hues - usually red or green - are used to preserve our night vision. They also don't carry as far, which is more discreet in a tactical environment.</p><h3>How many lumens should a good headlamp have?</h3><p>If you need to read a map or move around a campsite, a basic headlamp with around 200 lumens is sufficient. Action sports require you to see further ahead as you increase speed, so a headlamp with 750 to 1,000 lumens might be a better option.</p><h3>How long do headlamps batteries last?</h3><p>As a very general estimate, a low-lumen flashlight (under 50 lumens) will run for about 20-50 hours. A flashlight with 50-150 lumens will run for about 6-12 hours on it's highest setting, and high lumen flashlight or headlamp (over 150 lumens) will run about 2-8 hours on their highest settings.</p><h3>How Do I Choose a Headlamp?</h3><p>First, decide what you'll use your headlamp to accomplish. If you need to move through terrain with obstacles or wildlife then you'll need more lumens - at least 250. If you're a hunter or angler then you might want blue and green LED options. You'll want to choose a design with a band that's comfortable for your personal needs, including your head, skin, and hair. If you're bouncing around, you might want a headlamp with a top strap. You'll also need to consider whether the battery duration is a match for your field hours. If not, you'll need to decide if you want to carry extra batteries or a portable power bank to recharge the headlamp.</p>"
carry on backpacks,"<h2>FAQs about carry-on backpacks</h2><h3>What size should my carry-on backpack be?</h3><p>The best way to determine what size is right for you is to measure your height in inches or centimeters, then compare it to the dimensions of the item you are checking out. If it's too small, you will spill things inside and if it's too big, you'll have a lot of excess material hanging off the outside that could catch on something and rip open your bag. Make sure you get one with enough room to hold all your essentials.</p><h3>How much does a carry-on backpack weigh?</h3><p>A typical carry-on backpack weighs anywhere from 10 to 15 pounds, but some can go up to 20 pounds or more. The heaviest was a 40-pound roller duffel while the lightest I saw was a five-pound laptop sleeve. Most manufacturers offer lighter/smaller options than their standard sizes, so check out the specs carefully before purchasing. Also, remember that most airlines allow two checked bags, so if you're bringing a large duffel, think about checking it as luggage instead.</p><h3>Is it better to travel with a backpack or suitcase?</h3><p>If you fly to your destination and stay in the same hotel or resort for the duration of your trip, a suitcase is probably the most convenient option. If you plan to move around from place to place during your trip, a backpack will better suit you. For long trips, backpacks are usually the better choice.</p><h3>What's the difference between a backpack and a rucksack?</h3><p>Backpacks can come in all shapes and sizes.

camping pillows,"<h2>FAQs about camping pillows</h2><h3>How much do they cost?</h3><p>Pillow prices vary widely depending on materials, size, and brand. Most budget-friendly options are made of synthetic materials and lack any kind of stuffing or fluff inside. Premium pillows can be hundreds of dollars more and use down or synthetic fillings to provide support and comfort while sleeping.</p><h3>What is the best material for a pillow?</h3><p>Synthetic materials like polyester and nylon are lightweight, breathable, and durable, making them ideal for car camping. They also don't pack away easily when packed out in the open. Cotton and wool are traditional materials used for high-end outdoor pillows, but they're not as durable as synthetics and tend to shrink when wet, so I wouldn't recommend using them in the rain unless you plan to stuff them with something insulating like down or synthetic filling.</p><h3>Are Camping Pillows Worth It?</h3><p>Absolutely. Camping pillows add a bit of comfort and help you get a better night's sleep than a pile of clothes or a wadded-up jacket. The minimal investment of money, pack space, and weight is nothing compared to the comfort a pillow provides. It only takes one night of trying to sleep without one to realize the value that a good camp pillow provides.</p><h3>How do I wash my camping pillow?</h3><p>It depends on the camping pillow. Some have removable covers that are machine-washable. Some must be hand-washed and air-dried. It's always best to check the manufacturer's instructions to be sure.</p><h3>Can you use regular pillows for camping?</h3><p>You can use regular pillows for camping, and some people do. The problem is regular pillows are not designed to be used in an outdoor environment and are much more prone to soiling, staining, and ruin. They also are not very packable for backpackers.</p><h3>What do backpackers use for pillows?</h3><p>Backpackers tend to prefer inflatable pillows because they are super light, compact, packable, easy to clean, and more affordable. They are also adjustable since they are filled with air, so you can adjust the pillow's height and thickness to your liking.</p>"
hiking pants for women,"<h2>FAQs about hiking pants for women</h2><h3>How tight should women's hiking pants be?</h3><p>Hiking pants shouldn fit snugly around the waist and legs, but not so tight that they constrict circulation. If you plan to wear compression socks or leggings underneath, make sure your pants have enough room in the leg openings to allow for movement.</p><h3>What fabric should women's hiking pants be made of?</h3><p>Hiking pants should be made from a synthetic material that wicks moisture away from your skin to keep you warm and dry while moving through rugged terrain. Cotton is great, but remember that cotton doesn't breathe, so if you're going to be out in the elements, it's best to go with something like polyester or nylon. Also, avoid wearing cotton/cotton blends as these materials don't stretch, which can lead to chafing and rashes. Stick with synthetics like polyester or nylon.</p><h3>How durable should women's hiking pants be?</h3><p>Hiking pants are designed to withstand the rigors of outdoor activity, but they're not indestructible. Avoid wearing your hiking pants for long periods of time without proper care and conditioning, and avoid wearing them when wet as they may shrink and cling to your body. Also, avoid using bleach or other harsh chemicals on your clothing, especially if you plan to wash them at home rather than by hand-washing them in cold water and mild detergent. This will help preserve the life of your clothing and prevent color fading.

Make sure you dry off the blade before storing it away, though, or else you risk rusting the blade.</p><h3>How sharp should axe be?</h3><p>An axe must simply be sharp enough to slice through wood fibers, not so sharp that you can shave with it (though that often seems to be the test with internet axe-sharpening gurus).</p><h3>What makes a good axe?</h3><p>The most important part of an ax is the head.

led flashlight,"<h2>FAQs on led flashlights</h2><h3>How do I adjust the brightness of a LED flashlight?</h3><p>By moving the lens closer or farther from the LED, you can control how much light is emitted. The farther away the lens is from the LED, the less lumens produced. Moving the lens to its farthest position will cut off all light output and make your flashlight useless for any purpose other than signaling.</p><h3>What size flashlight should I get?</h3><p>The best answer to this question is whatever fits your hand comfortably while maintaining an adequate grip on the flashlight. If you plan on using it as a weapon, then go with something larger. If not, go with something smaller. It's personal preference, but I prefer small lights for EDC and medium-sized lights for home defense. If you're a diehard tactical flashlight nut, then go big. If not, go with a rechargeable option. That being said, don't skimp on the batteries if you want to use it as a regular flashlight. You'll thank me later when you need it in the middle of the night and find yourself low on power. I recommend getting at least two CR123A batteries, which are commonly available at hardware stores and online retailers. They're rechargeable and reliable, but they won't last forever, so be sure to spring for some lithium ion batteries if you plan on carrying it around regularly.</p><h3>What is the most reliable flashlight?</h3><p>There are a lot of companies that make reliable flashlights, but some of the features we look for are waterproof housings, protected lenses, and rechargeable batteries.

Some manufacturers offer both styles in different sizes, so it's important to read the specifications carefully before making a purchase. Also, keep in mind that the more rugged a watch looks, the less reliable its internal components will be.

Just remember to dry off the inside of the case after each use.</p><h3>How long do smartwatches last?</h3><p>This depends on the type of watch you pick. If you're shopping for a robust watch with plenty of smart features such as sending and receiving calls and texts, then expect a significantly shorter battery life that might max out at two days.

That way, the metal won't be sitting on top of the ground where it's exposed to the elements and could rust away over time.</p><h3>How deep do most metal detectors go?</h3><p>The vast majority of metal detectors can sense metal objects up to 6 inches deep in the ground, which is where you'd expect to find the most sought-after things like coins, rings, and other jewelry.

nato straps,"<h2>FAQs about nato straps</h2><h3>Are leather NATO straps good?</h3><p>To me, leather NATO straps ruin the point of a NATO strap, given that one of my favorite characteristics of them is that I can just take them off and throw them in the wash.

They typically have a peak height taller than six feet, allowing most people to comfortably walk around.</p><h3>Are six-person tents good for car camping?</h3><p>Yes, although we'd recommend going with something with more room for gear like a seven- or eight-person tent instead. That being said, they're great for car camping when space is tight and/or weather is uncertain. They also pack down very compactly when collapsed, making them ideal for car camping in areas where ground space is at a premium. They're also versatile enough to use as backpacking tents or even as outdoor playhouses for the kids. Just remember that they don't come with poles, so you'll need to purchase those separately if you plan to set up your tent in the field. Also, note that some manufacturers offer lifetime warranties on their tents, while others offer limited warranties. Check out our warranty page for details.</p><h3>What are the other benefits of a 6-person tent?</h3><p>Six-person tents generally have ample storage space, with pockets on the inside and large vestibules to store larger gear or to cook under when it's raining. They also often include room dividers for some extra privacy.</p>"
survival radios,"<h2>FAQs on survival radios</h2><h3>How do I use a survival radio?</h3><p>Follow the instructions. The most important thing is to keep it powered up and charged, so you can hear vital information in an emergency.</p><h3>What size should my survival radio be?</h3><p>Your survival radio should be large enough to comfortably fit your hand when you press the talk button. If you have small or medium-sized hands, get a model with a longer cord. If you plan to wear gloves, make sure your radio has a long enough cord to allow your hands to dangle freely without hitting the case or antennae. Also, check out the video below for tips on how to operate your survival radio while wearing gloves. You'll want to avoid pressing any buttons if you're wearing gloves, but you can still use it as a regular radio by holding it away from your ear and listening to the speaker.</p><h3>What Is The Main Thing I Should Consider When Buying A Radio?</h3><p>The reception ability of the emergency radio is of utmost importance because if it cannot receive messages, it will be a waste. You should look for an additional antenna as well to boost your reception. If you live in areas prone to flooding or facing storms then NOAA or SAME enabled radio will help you take preventive measures faster. Other than that, any extra feature will come handy.</p><h3>Why Do I Need A Waterproof Radio?</h3><p>If you live in an area where the rainfall is substantial or is prone to flooding, then you need a waterproof receiver. Standard radio without this feature will get destroyed in water.</p><h3>Do I Need Proper Training To Use Survival Radios?</h3><p>Most of the radios are easy to operate. But you should never buy a piece of equipment before you know how to use it. There are tons of features and settings in radios; thus, it is better you learn about them and then buy. Also, look for a radio that comes with a user manual to help you get accustomed to its features better.</p>"
tritium watches,"<h2>FAQs about tritium watches</h2><h3>What is the most luminous material?</h3><p>Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, and it's the lightest naturally occurring isotope. It's also one of the few isotopes that can be used in high-tech applications like night vision and laser pointers. The downside to using tritium is that it has a relatively short half-life (about 12 years). Also, it emits an extremely low-energy photon, so you need a very sensitive detector to pick up its signal. Finally, it's expensive and difficult to obtain in large quantities.</p><h3>Are tritium dials safe?</h3><p>Contrary to urban myths, these watches are not dangerous. Tritium emits a very weak beta particle and people are exposed to small amounts of tritium every day, since it is widely dispersed in the environment and in the food chain</p><h3>How much does a tritium watch cost?</h3><p>A typical tritium watch costs between $150 and $200. That said, there are some really nice vintage pieces out there for under $100, so don't rule out buying something new if you find one you like. If you're willing to part with a little extra money, you can get a quality titanium case and bracelet, which will add up to another $250 to $300 to your price tag. That said, I wouldn't recommend going this route unless you plan on wearing it all the time, as the added weight could cause the watch to slip off your wrist or break if you drop it. Also, titanium is not water resistant, so you'll want to keep it somewhere dry when not in use.</p><h3>Do watches still use tritium?</h3><p>In watches manufactured today, tiny, narrow glass tubes filled with tritium gas (GTLS = gaseous tritium light sources) are used. For normal use of such a watch the annual effective dose is far below 0.1 micro Sv.</p><h3>Does tritium glow forever?</h3><p>However, tritium gas tubes have a half life of 12 years and will need to be replaced after roughly 24 years (modern lume such as Super LumiNova doesn't last forever, either). Tritium glows less brightly than many lume applications at full charge, but will often be brighter within the first hour as the lume fades.</p>"
tool box,"<h2>FAQs on tool boxes</h2><h3>What size should my toolbox be?</h3><p>Toolboxes are designed to hold a certain number of tools. If you have a wide variety of tools, you might want to look at a two-drawer or three-drawer organizer instead.</p><h3>How do I organize my tools?</h3><p>Tools can be organized in a variety of ways. For general tasks like drilling and screwdriving, it's best to keep them all together in one place. For more specialized tasks, like wiring and plumbing, it's helpful to keep the tools for those specific jobs together as well. For power tools, it's important to keep them away from combustible materials like wood and metal, so keep them somewhere dry and out of the way. For small hand tools, it's also helpful to keep them close at hand when possible, but don't overstuff your workbench. For larger hand tools, like drills and saws, it's helpful to keep them up high where they won't get knocked off by accident. For power tools, keep them somewhere dry and out of the way.</p><h3>What is the purpose of a tool box?</h3><p>A toolbox (also called toolkit, tool chest or workbox) is a box to organize, carry, and protect the owner's tools. They could be used for trade, a hobby or DIY, and their contents vary with the craft.</p><h3>What is the importance of tools?</h3><p>With the right tools, you can work more efficiently and get the job done right. It is important to select the right tools for the job when working with tools. The wrong tools can not only make the job more difficult but can also pose a safety hazard. Using the proper tools can help you avoid injuries while working.</p><h3>What is usually in a toolbox?</h3><p>Small tools. Fill your toolbox with basics such as a set of Allen keys, a measuring tape, electrical and duct tape, a builder's knife and the all-important builder's pencil (or a few if yours often go walkabout).</p>"
tactical sunglasses,"<h2>FAQs about tactical sunglasses</h2><h3>Do all polarized sunglasses block out 100% of light?</h3><p>No. Polarized sunglasses reduce glare but do not completely eliminate it. They still allow some light through, especially when looking directly into the sun. This means that polarized sunglasses won't provide complete protection from harmful UV rays.</p><h3>Is it safe to drive without sunglasses?</h3><p>It's always safer to wear sunglasses whenever driving, even during daylight hours. Sunglasses offer better visibility than no eyewear, and they'll keep your eyes from drying out due to exposure to direct sunlight.</p><h3>Where should I store my sunglasses?</h3><p>You shouldn't put your sunglasses in your car trunk because heat could cause them to crack or break. Instead, store them in a cool place where they won't get damaged.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Will sunglasses hurt my eyes?</h3><p>Some people think that wearing sunglasses hurts their eyes. In reality, however, most people experience little discomfort when wearing sunglasses. Wearing sunglasses doesn't necessarily mean that you're going blind; instead, it just helps to shield your eyes from damaging amounts of visible light.</p><h3>Does wearing sunglasses increase my risk of getting cataracts?</h3><p>Wearing sunglasses doesn't increase your risk of developing cataracts. Cataracts develop gradually over time, and they often occur naturally anyway. There isn't much evidence that wearing sunglasses increases your risk of developing cataracts.</p><h3>Which types of sunglasses are best for me?</h3><p>When choosing between different styles of sunglasses, consider how well they fit your face shape, whether they have interchangeable lenses, and what type of lens material they contain. Here are some things to look for when shopping for new sunglasses:</p><p>Frames come in various shapes, including round, square, rectangular, oval, and trapezoidal. Round frames tend to give off a sporty vibe, whereas rectangular frames are classic and timeless. Oval frames are versatile and go with almost anything. Trapezoid frames are trendy and modern.</p>"
tactical gloves,"<h2>FAQs on tactical gloves</h2><h3>What is the difference between tactical and utility gloves?</h3><p>Tac Ops are designed to provide maximum protection for your hands while performing tasks that require precision or force, like using a firearm.</p><h3>How tight should tactical gloves be?</h3><p>Tight enough to where you can still use your natural grip, but not so tight as to cut off circulation or make it hard to open/close your hand. If you're unsure, ask someone to demonstrate how they would normally do the task at hand before donning the glove. You'll know when you've got it right.</p><h3>What is the point of tactical gloves?</h3><p>Tactical gloves are specifically designed to address the needs of those in combative environments, and prioritize things like abrasion resistance, durability, impact resistance, and fire resistance, all in colors that are considered acceptable by most military branches. They will often feature reinforced fingers for trigger pulling, hardened knuckles to prevent blunt force trauma, and other specific features that are designed for military or shooting applications.</p><h3>Who uses tactical gloves?</h3><p>Tactical gloves can serve any number of purposes, but in general, these gloves are designed to safeguard military, law enforcement, and sports enthusiasts' hands from injury and provide protection in a variety of environments and conditions.</p><h3>Do tactical gloves keep your hands warm?</h3><p>Tactical gloves aren't actually made to keep your hands warm in extremely cold weather conditions. They'll offer a slight amount of warmth but aren't adequate for sub-zero weather.</p><h3>What are tactical gloves good for?</h3><p>Tactical gloves are designed to protect your hands and wrists from physical harm and injury without sacrificing dexterity. They're ideal for shooting and other activities that require agility and precision and defend your hands against cuts and abrasions.</p>"
slip joint knives,"<h2>FAQs on slip joint knives</h2><h3>How thick should a slip joint knife be?</h3><p>The thickness of your knife will depend on how you intend to use it. If you plan to skin and dress small game, you'll want something with a thin edge for easy handling. If you plan to cut meat or vegetables, you'll want something with a little more weight behind the blade for added control and protection against accidentally cutting yourself. If you plan to perform any kind of detailed work like filleting or deboning, you'll want something with a full 4 inches of steel behind the edge.</p><h3>What is the difference between slip and clip joint knives?</h3><p>A slip joint knife has a longer spine than a clip joint knife, which allows the user to maintain better posture while using the knife. The downside is that the grip can feel awkward when compared to a clip joint knife, especially if you have smaller hands. Also, the lack of a thumb guard makes it harder to keep an edge on the blade. However, if you plan to use your knife for general prep tasks, like chopping vegetables, then a slip joint knife may be just what you need. If you plan to use it for carving or other fine-detail tasks, however, you'll want a clip joint knife.</p><h3>Are slip joint knives good for camping?</h3><p>Yes, although I wouldn't recommend taking one on a multi-day backpacking trip. The lack of a thumb guard means you're more likely to lose control of the knife and stab yourself or someone else, so extra care must be taken when in the field. Also, the lack of a finger guard means you're more likely to cut yourself when preparing food. That being said, they're still very useful tools for camp chores like opening packages.</p><h3>What is a slip joint knife?</h3><p>Any folding knife that is kept open by some kind of joint contact between the tang and the handle, and can be disengaged by just pushing on the blade is a slip joint. It doesn't have to have multiple blades, and it has nothing to do with the blade or handle shape.</p><h3>Why do people like slip joint knives?</h3><p>There are no moving parts on a fixed blade, and many early injuries are just from the operation of the knife. Slip joints aren't quite as simplistic as fixed blades, but as long as they can be opened with a pinch grip, they are generally easier to open and close than knives that lock.</p>"
safety glasses,"<h2>FAQs on safety glasses</h2><h3>How do I clean my safety glasses?</h3><p>Your safety glasses can be cleaned with mild soap and water. Make sure to rinse them thoroughly, as dirt and grime can build up over time and make your glasses foggy or cloudy. If you are concerned about scratching the lenses, use a non-abrasive cloth.</p><h3>What should I look for when buying safety glasses?</h3><p>Safety glasses should have a secure fit around the nose and cheeks, but not press against the bridge of the nose or rub on the inside of the ear. The nosepiece should sit flush with the end of the lens, so that debris doesn't get caught between the nosepiece and the lens. The earpieces should also be snug enough to avoid catching on things, but not so tight as to cause ear fatigue. The hinges should be smooth and easy to open and close without catching on anything. The arms of the glasses should extend far enough to cover your ears, but not so far as to expose the hinge. The arm tips should taper smoothly into the frame of the glasses, so that they don't dig into your ears.</p><h3>What is the difference between safety goggles and safety glasses?</h3><p>Here are the key differences between goggles and glasses: Safety goggles offer complete protection around your eye. Safety glasses may only offer protection around the front and sides (not to the top).</p><h3>Can safety glasses be worn all day?</h3><p>Workers are worried whether or not it's healthy for their eyes to be looking through a ""plastic""(aka polycarbonate) lens all day while on the job; it's a valid concern. The short answer is no - wearing safety eyewear cannot damage your vision.</p><h3>What is the importance of safety glasses?</h3><p>Wearing safety eyewear in your home, workshop, garage, yard, or workplace can protect your eyes from injury and damage. Your eye can sustain significant injury from airborne chemicals, dust, and debris, so it's important to protect yourself from potential harm.</p>"
rescue knife,"<h2>FAQs about rescue knives</h2><h3>How do I use a rescue knife?</h3><p>Rescue knives are designed to be used in tight spaces where you don't have the luxury of time for fancy moves. For instance, if you were trapped on a roof and needed to get down safely, you'd probably reach for your trusty Gerber LMF II. The same goes for climbing walls or fences, etc.</p><h3>What is the best type of rescue knife?</h3><p>Rescue knives come in many different shapes and sizes, so it's hard to say that one particular type is ""best"" because they're all designed for specific tasks. However, there are several features that make the Gerber LMF II stand out from the crowd. It has a thumb stud for easy one-handed opening, and the blade stays open until released by the flick of a button. This makes it easier to control in tight spaces, and less likely to accidentally cut yourself while trying to defend yourself against an attacker. The only downside is that the blade length isn't great for cutting through material like ropes or webbing, but it's still serviceable.</p><h3>Where should I carry my rescue knife?</h3><p>Your rescue knife's storage location will depend on your activities while carrying and what position(s) you are likely to be in while responding to an emergency. For example, Coast Guard rescue swimmers usually have a dedicated pouch for their blades, while EMT's are more likely to have a bag or pants with appropriate exterior pockets.</p><h3>What makes a good rescue knife?</h3><div>Reliable blades feature good quality blade steel, a partially (or fully) serrated edge, a carbide window breaker, and a seat belt cutter, but beware of gimmicks at this price point. For something with higher quality or specialization, you'll end up shelling out somewhere between $50 and $125.</div><h3>Can I stab someone with a rescue knife?</h3><p>No, unless you plan to impale them on the end of your blade. That said, you can certainly deliver a painful jolt to an attacker's arm or leg with a solid blow from your rescue knife. If you're lucky, they'll drop their weapon and run away. If not, you'll need to finish them off with something else, which might be easier with a longer blade. Still, if you're in a pinch and feel the need to stick somebody, the Gerber LMF II will serve you well. You won't be able to stab through clothing.</p>"
windproof lighter,"<h2>FAQs on windproof lighters</h2><h3>What is a wind proof lighter?</h3><p>These lighters typically run on butane, and they emit flames that are supposed to be strong enough to stay lit when wind is blowing. Many fuel-based windproof lighters are also double flame torch lighters, which gives you extra power and double the flame output to withstand wind.</p><h3>What is the most wind-resistant fuel?</h3><p>The most wind-resistant fuel is unleaded gasoline, but that's also the least efficient. Premium unleaded is a close second, and regular unleaded is third. Diesel is next, followed by kerosene, then gas/propane. The least wind-resistant fuel is alcohol (ethanol), which burns cleaner than regular gasoline but doesn't ignite as readily in cold weather.</p><h3>How do I adjust my windproof lighter?</h3><p>Your windproof lighter should feel snug when you hold it between your thumb and forefinger. If it feels loose or wobbly, you can tighten the spring clip to secure it in place. Make sure the flame adjustment lever is set to ""Low"" or ""Medium.""</p><h3>How do I clean my windproof lighter?</h3><p>You'll want to make sure your windproof lighter isn't leaking any petroleum products before attempting to clean it. Otherwise, you could risk starting a fire or damaging your lighter if you get too much dirt buildup inside of it. Use mild dish soap and warm water to remove stubborn dirt and grime. Be careful not to scrub away the protective coating on the outside of your lighter, though. That's what makes it windproof, so don't worry about scratching it off. Just make sure you rinse it thoroughly after cleaning.</p><h3>How do I use a windproof lighter?</h3><p>Hold the base of the windproof lighter between your thumb and forefinger, with the flame adjustment lever pointing down. Place your windproof lighter on top of your fuel source, such as a disposable butane tank, a refillable propane tank, or a can.</p><h3>Is butane gas poisonous?</h3><p>The toxicity of butane is low. Huge exposure concentrations can be assumed in butane abuse. The predominant effects observed in abuse cases are central nervous system (CNS) and cardiac effects.</p>"
survival books,"<h2>FAQs on survival books</h2><h3>What is the best type of survival book?</h3><p>The best type of survival book is one that has a mix of information and tips for getting yourself and your family out alive, along with exercises to help you practice those skills in an emergency. The more hands-on training you can get, the better.</p><h3>Are survival books worth it?</h3><p>It depends. If you're someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, then yes, definitely invest in a quality survival guide to help you prepare for the worst. If you're someone who stays indoors most of the time, then probably not. But if you're someone who ventures out occasionally, especially in places where cell service isn't reliable, then definitely consider picking up a survival guide to help you stay safe and healthy while away from electricity and running water. You'll thank yourself later.</p><h3>How Much Time Do You Have Before An Emergency Occurs?</h3><p>You might think that all survival guides are equally helpful. However, some books are better suited to specific circumstances than others. For example, a guide designed for hikers who encounter a bear during a hike may be useless when you are stranded in the wilderness. Similarly, a guide intended for people living in a flood zone may not work well for those who live in a tornado alley.</p><h3>What is the easiest shelter to build?</h3><p>The simplest shelter is a fallen tree that has enough room under it for you to crawl in. Lean branches against the windward side of the tree (so the wind is blowing into it and not against it) to make a wall. Make the wall thick enough to keep out wind.</p><h3>Can you teach yourself survival skills?</h3><p>Don't wait until you are stuck in the wilderness to practice your survival skills. Learning essential skills such as fire building and constructing a shelter is a great weekend project you can do in the safety of your backyard.</p>"
waterproof bluetooth speaker,"<h2>FAQs on waterproof bluetooth speakers</h2><h3>What is the best time to water proof a Bluetooth speaker?</h3><p>The best time to water proof a Bluetooth speaker is when it's not in use. If you do decide to go this route, make sure to dry off the inside of the device thoroughly before recharging or using it for any length of time.</p><h3>How waterproof are Bluetooth speakers?</h3><p>Bluetooth speakers are designed to be water resistant and can handle brief splashes from rain or puddles without breaking a sweat. However, if you plan to take your Bluetooth speaker into the ocean or pool, you'll want to spring for a waterproof option. Otherwise, you risk damaging the speaker by exposing it to water for too long. The good news is that most manufacturers offer waterproof options, so finding one shouldn't be too hard. Just make sure to keep it somewhere dry when not in use.</p><h3>What should I look for in a waterproof Bluetooth speaker?</h3><p>For your portable Bluetooth speaker, you should look for a rating of at least 7, which indicates that it's safe from full immersion in water 1 meter (3.3 feet) deep for 30 minutes. A rating of 8 is even better, but the exact details of testing vary by manufacturer.</p><h3>How Does a Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker Work?</h3><p>Bluetooth waterproof speakers are made up of three main components being the drivers, crossovers, and the cabinet. The drivers convert electrical energy into mechanical energy which produces different sound pitches.</p><h3>What is considered waterproof?</h3><p>For the most part, waterproof means no water in, no water out. To be entirely waterproof, the surface must be completely impervious to water and provide a high level of sustained water protection during harsh conditions and extended exposure.</p><h3>What are waterproof speakers made of?</h3><p>Manufacturers of weatherproof equipment use stainless steel, aluminum or brass. Unlike weatherproof speakers, which use mylar diaphragms, indoor speakers have paper diaphragms in the drivers, which are sensitive to humidity</p>"
tourniquet,"<h2>FAQs about tourniquets</h2><h3>How tight should a tourniquet be?</h3><p>Tourniquets are designed to apply pressure on an extremity, usually the upper arm or thigh, and restrict blood flow to the limb. The goal is to stop blood loss until help arrives.</p><h3>When should I use a tourniquet?</h3><p>Use a tourniquet when the hemorrhage is life-threatening and cannot be stopped by direct pressure. However, if the bleeding can be controlled by hand pressure or bandaging, then a tourniquet is not necessary.</p><h3>What is the best material for a tourniquet?</h3><p>Any material that can withstand high pressure will work. Cotton works well, but synthetic materials like polyester have better tensile strength and won't stretch as much. Leather is tough and supple, but not very compressible. Rubber is soft and pliable, but not as strong as other materials. Check out this article from 2015 comparing different materials for tourniquets. It's a great read if you're curious about what works best for your purposes.</p><h3>Are tourniquets safe?</h3><p>Yes. Some people have concerns that using a tourniquet will only make matters worse. However, research has shown that only 0.4 percent of patients who applied a tourniquet underwent limb amputation, and it had nothing to do with the kit. Also, only 1.5 percent of these patients suffered severe nerve damage. Therefore, a tourniquet is the safest way to stop severe bleeding.</p><h3>How should I use a tourniquet?</h3><p>It is recommended that the tourniquet is placed directly on the skin several inches above the wound. However, avoid placing it on the joint, since it might not be as effective and can also cause damage to the joint.</p><h3>What can be used in place of a tourniquet?</h3><p>Belts can be a good tourniquet. You can also tear a piece of clothing to approximately three inches wide. Shirt sleeves, pant legs, scarves and bandanas are all potential options. Whatever you use, be sure it's wide and thick enough to prevent injury to the limb.</p>"
gun belts,"<h2>FAQs about gun belts</h2><h3>What is a gun belt used for?</h3><p>A gun belt is designed to carry your firearm comfortably while in the field. It's also commonly used by military and law enforcement officers as part of their tactical loadout, although some manufacturers make them for civilian use as well.</p><h3>How tight should my gun belt be?</h3><p>Your gun belt should fit snugly but not constrict your breathing or circulation. If it does, you may want to look at another option. A good rule of thumb is if you can see your trigger finger when looking down the barrel of your weapon, your gun belt is too loose. If you can't see your trigger finger, your gun belt is too tight.</p><h3>Can I wear a gun belt with body armor?</h3><p>Yes, although you might want to consider an under-the-armour carrier like the Tactical Pants Carrier from Blue Force Gear instead. The carrier provides additional protection for your firearm and can help distribute the weight of your gear across both hips and shoulders. It's also possible to wear a gun belt over body armor, although we wouldn't recommend it. The carrier will still protect your firearm, but you won't have any mobility and could get caught in the wrong place during a firefight. Stick with a carrier that doesn't rely on snaps or zippers to keep your equipment secure.</p><h3>Are gun belts worth it?</h3><p>Absolutely! A quality gun belt can last for years and serve as a great way to transport your firearm safely while in the field. You'll also find that they're extremely versatile and can be worn with anything from tactical pants to cargo pants to work or play. As long as you don't mind a little extra.</p><h3>What makes a good gun belt?</h3><p>A good gun belt should be rigid enough to support your equipment, while also being flexible enough to move with your body. It should also be stable when worn with an inner belt, to prevent the belt from moving when you go to draw a magazine. All gun belts on this list satisfy this need.</p>"
rangefinders,"<h2>FAQs on rangefinders</h2><h3>How long do laser rangefinders last?</h3><p>Like anything, the better you care for it, the longer it will last. That said, when I asked Google this same question, the most common answer was about five years, but this probably has a lot to do with the frequency of use as well.</p><h3>What is the difference between a laser rangefinder and a regular rangefinder?</h3><p>A laser rangefinder uses light instead of a mechanical or electronic sensor to measure distance. It's more accurate than a regular rangefinder, but it does require line-of-sight to work. Also, lasers are expensive, so you'll want to make sure you're getting one that meets your specific needs before plunking down the cash for one.</p><h3>Do you need a slope on a rangefinder?</h3><p>It depends on your terrain. If you plan to hunt from an elevated position or you're roving through mountainous terrain, you'll probably want to have a rangefinder that accounts for slope and calculates your distance using Angle Compensation.</p><h3>How do I use a laser rangefinder?</h3><p>The laser rangefinder emits a beam of infrared light which reflects off objects back to the device. The time taken for the return trip from the target to the rangefinder to the receiver to process the data and return the result to the display is measured and displayed as the range in meters. The laser rangefinder then displays the appropriate number of seconds it would take to reach the target at that speed. If you were shooting a pistol, the laser rangefinder would tell you how far away your target was and how fast you could get there if you used a particular grip style. If you were hunting with a spotting scope, the laser rangefinder could help you dial in the perfect shot placement by measuring the exact distance between where your crosshairs rest and the target itself.</p><h3>How do you bow hunt without a rangefinder?</h3><p>Some bowhunters, especially treestand hunters, circumvent the need for rangefinders by pre-marking range distances within their field of fire. This can be done by measuring the distance from the base of your tree to prominent features (like trees, rocks, fences, etc.) in the surrounding area. Having these known distances to key features can help a bowhunter estimate their target's distance by means of comparison.</p>"
stainless steel cookware,"<h2>FAQs on stainless steel cookware</h2><h3>What is the difference between stainless steel and carbon steel?</h3><p>Stainless steel is a type of steel that resists corrosion, especially when exposed to acids or alkali solutions. Carbon steel will rust in these conditions, but it won't corrode like stainless steel. The downside to stainless steel is that it doesn't conduct heat as well as carbon steel, so you'll need to use more fuel to get the same amount of heat into your food. That said, stainless steel pans are easier to clean than carbon steel, so they're worth considering.</p><h3>How durable are stainless steel cookware?</h3><p>Stainless steel pans are extremely durable, lasting for decades if not hundreds of thousands of uses without any issues. However, they can scratch easily, so take care when using them on non-stick surfaces. They also don't conduct heat as well as carbon steel, so you'll need to use more fuel to get the same amount of heat into your food. That said, stainless steel pans are easier to clean than carbon steel, so they're worth considering.</p><h3>Are stainless steel pans good for baking?</h3><p>Yes, absolutely! Stainless steel pans are great for baking because they resist rusting, and they conduct heat evenly. They also make cleaning up messes much easier, since there's no blackened coating to scrub off. However, they don't conduct heat as well as carbon steel, so you'll need to adjust your cooking times accordingly.</p><h3>How Does the Stainless Steel Pot Feel in Your Hands?</h3><p>The stainless steel pot feels warm and smooth in your hands. You may find that you prefer to hold it with the lid resting between your fingers so that you can use both hands to grasp the handle. The handle is designed with a curve on the end, which lets you easily loop your thumb underneath, giving you a more secure grip.</p><h3>How Many Layers Does a Stainless Steel Pot Contain?</h3><p>Stainless steel pots are one of the most common types of cookware out there, and they're famous for a reason. They have excellent heat retention, a non-reactive surface that's easy to maintain, and a sleek, professional look that makes them perfect for everything from making sauces to serving soft-boiled eggs. Stainless steel pots are made up of many layers of different metals. Most stainless steel pots consist of 3 layers.</p>"
two way radio,"<h2>FAQs about two-way radios</h2><h3>What is the difference between a one- and two-way radio?</h3><p>A one-way radio transmits on a single frequency, allowing it to be used for communication within a certain radius. A two-way radio transmits on both a primary and secondary frequency, allowing it to be used for communication over longer distances.</p><h3>What are the 2 major formats of most two-way radio?</h3><p>There are two major formats for most two-way radios. They are Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radio and Very High Frequency (VHF) radio. Neither frequency band is inherently better than the other. They each have their pluses and minuses.</p><h3>What is the difference between a walkie talkie and a 2-way radio?</h3><p>A two way radio is also commonly called a transceiver, because it can both transmit and receive radio communications. In either case, the radio operates two ways; it can send and it can receive. A walkie talkie is a portable two way radio, particularly one that can be held in the hand.</p><h3>What radio works best in the mountains?</h3><p>UHF radios are typically preferred for use indoors and outdoors in areas with a lot obstructions. FRS, GMRS and MURS radios are the logical choices.

Also, if you plan to hone multiple knives or tools at once, it's better to go with something that can withstand high heat and/or water immersion. That said, budget doesn't have to dictate quality. There are plenty of affordable options out there that perform just as well as more expensive ones.</p><h3>Which whetstone should a beginner buy?</h3><p>Recommended for beginners is combined use of a rough whetstone of #220 and medium whetstone of #1500. For general maintenance, using a medium whetstone alone can be enough, but in order to use it properly, the whetstone itself needs maintenance.</p><h3>Are sharpened knives more dangerous?</h3><p>Mistakenly, many people think that after being sharpened on the whetstone knives become very dangerous. A blunt knife is more dangerous because it damages products when cutting, as well as being terrible for quick and accurate cuts.</p><h3>How Are Diamond Sharpening Stones Made?</h3><p>Diamond sharpening stones are made from synthetic diamonds embedded in a metal or rigid plastic backing plate.

Most manufacturers publish this information somewhere on their website, and we've included it in our product reviews.</p><h3>How do you choose tent stakes?</h3><p>With all tent stakes, keep in mind that while shorter stakes are lighter, longer stakes have a better holding power. V- and Y-shaped stakes don't twist as easily in the soil as hook and nail stakes, which helps them stay put in wet and windy conditions.</p><h3>What Angle Should I Set My Tent Pegs to?</h3><p>Generally, you should drive your tent pegs into the ground at a 45-degree angle inward towards the tent. Doing so helps to prevent the tent from pulling off the ground in high winds. Typically, tent pegs are driven into the ground at a 45-degree angle to increase the grip and strength your tent pegs offer. Before you pitch your tent, you first want to test the ground. This allows the pegging task to go smoothly and to ensure you are using the right pegs for the ground.</p><h3>Do you need a hammer for tent pegs?</h3><p>f they are steel rock pegs then you need a steel hammer, not a rubber or wooden mallet as they would absorb the impact. I use a half pound claw hammer with a nylon shaft. If you are using wire pegs, the type usually supplied with the tent, then these are not meant to be hammered in and will bend if you try to do so.</p>"

Allow the moisture to escape. Warm air holds more moisture than cold air. Open the vents, or entrance door, raise the fly edge off the ground. On cold nights it might be your natural instinct to seal the tent as much as possible to keep the warmth in and the cold out. Don't!

That's enough for all my camping and work gear, plus room for everything else I might want to take on a trip.</p><h3>What is the difference between a gym bag and a duffel bag?</h3><p>A gym bag is typically hard-bottomed and sometimes has a rectangular base. A duffel bag on the other hand has an open structure. The lack of rigidity in their design differentiates the two when it comes to storing and carrying bulkier objects.</p><h3>Are duffle bags bad for your back?</h3><p>Heavy backpacks or bags can lead to back problems and poor posture even shoulder problems and headaches. We're carrying more baggage around than ever before and by baggage we don't mean the emotional weight of traumas past and present.</p><h3>How much does a duffel bag weigh?</h3><p>A good quality duffel weighs between 10 and 15 pounds depending on the materials used. The lighter duty versions can be as little as 7 pounds while the heavier duty models weigh in at around 17 pounds. If you are carrying more than one item of gear, you may want to look at getting two or three smaller bags that attach together to form a larger load-carrying system. This will help distribute the weight across several items and reduce fatigue on long treks.</p><h3>Can I Put My Duffel Bag in the Washing Machine?</h3><p>If your duffel bag is made from durable cloth or nylon, your bag is safe to put in the washing machine. Make it easy for yourself, and don't stress about having to hand wash. Just make sure you wash with cold water and air dry to avoid shrinking or warping fabric.</p><h3>Are Duffel Bags Safe to Put In the Dryer?</h3><p>If you want to put your duffel bag in a dryer, there's a right way to approach this. First, when you put it inside, include a couple of towels before running it on a regular cycle in your washing machine. Make sure that you use towels in a similar colour so that no colour bleeding will occur. Putting your duffel bag in the dryer on its own can be too harsh, and it might ruin the material of your bag.</p>"
down jackets,"<h2>FAQs on Down Jackets</h2><h3>Why do they call it down jacket?</h3><p>A down jacket is a jacket which has been insulated with the soft and warm under feathers from duck or geese. Down is a fantastic insulator as the loft (or fluffiness) of down creates thousands of tiny air pockets which trap warm air and retain heat, thus helping to keep the wearer very warm in cold winter weather.</p><h3>Is a down jacket the warmest?</h3><p>In short, absolutely. Down jackets made of goose down (the smaller, fluffier feathers underneath the harder exterior feathers) are pound for pound the best insulation against cold temperatures, according to NY Daily News.</p><h3>What is a down jacket good for?</h3><p>Down is a soft, heat-trapping fluff from ducks or geese that keeps them warm in the wild. Down jackets use this natural material as insulation because it's great at locking in warmth.</p><h3>Are down jackets water resistant?</h3>Don't wear a down jacket during rain. Remember, down jackets are not waterproof. They are only splashproof. If they are exposed to water for a long time, they will lose their fluffiness. They are made of feathers, after all.</p><h3>Do down jackets go flat?</h3><p>Over time, the feathers and down insulation in a garment can get packed down and become flat, making the fibres thinner and more likely to penetrate seams or a lining. Luckily, you can make your old down jacket new again with a simple wash, although it's essential to follow proper washing directions for down products.</p><h3>Do you wash down jackets?</h3><p>Machine-washing a down jacket. Use a down-specific soap or detergent. Skip the spin cycle. It's better for your down jacket to drip dry and/or use a tumble dryer.</p><h3>How often should you wash your down jacket?</h3><p>Not only are down products easy to wash, but they should be washed at least once or twice a year. Look for the label. Despite my inability to find a care label, most items should have one.</p><h3>How do you wear a down jacket?</h3><p>Down jackets are designed to be worn loose and over your regular clothes, so the most important thing is to make sure you have a good fit. Make sure the sleeves are long enough to cover your wrists, but not too long that they flutter in the breeze.</p><h3>What's the difference between insulated and non-insulated?</h3><p>Insulation adds warmth without adding bulk, making it perfect for outdoor activities like skiing or snowboarding. It also helps resist moisture, keeping you warm and dry while wearing less clothing than a non-insulated jacket would require. The downside of insulation is that it does add weight to the jacket, which may cause you to overheat if you're not careful. If you plan on doing strenuous activity in the cold, then an insulated jacket is a great investment. Otherwise, stick with a non-insulated option.</p>"
compression socks,"<h2>FAQs on Compression Socks</h2><h3>How tight should my compression sock be?</h3><p>Your compression sock should feel snug but not constricting. The best way to find the right fit is to try a few pairs of your favorite athletic or workout gear and see how they fit. If you're used to tight jeans, then stick with that size.</p><h3>How to measure compression socks size?</h3><ul><li>Step 1: Measure the circumference of the ankle at the narrowest part of the ankle, just above the ankle bone.</li><li>Step 2: Measure the circumference of the calf at the widest part of the calf.</li><li>Step 3: Measure the length of the calf. The measure is taken on the outside of the leg, by measuring from the floor up to the bend of the knee.</li><li>Step 4: Use the above compression sock size chart to determine your size.</li><li>Step 5: Ensure that the sock band lies flat and that the top of the band sits 2 finger widths below the crease of the knee. Never pull the sock up into the crease behind your knee as this may limit the circulation.</li></ul><h3>What do compression socks do for me?</h3><p>Compression socks help maintain body heat and promote circulation by compressing blood vessels and veins, which helps move more oxygen throughout your body. They also reduce muscle fatigue and can help prevent shin splints during long runs.</p><p>Compression socks are great for any activity where you need extra support in your legs, especially when wearing shorts or short-length pants. They're also great for women who want to avoid panty lines while running or working out in the gym. For those looking to tone up, compression socks can help increase muscle mass and improve vascularity, making them an excellent choice for a full-body workout.</p><h3>How long does it take for compression socks to work?</h3><p>For best results, put on your compression garment first thing in the morning. This is when your limbs are the least swollen. Visible improvement in the appearance of your veins can take up to six weeks to see.</p><h3>When should you wear compression socks?</h3><p>You can wear your compression socks all day by putting them on when getting dressed in the morning, and take them off before bed (unless your doctor advises otherwise).</p><h3>Can I wear compression socks all day?</h3><p>Yes, although most experts recommend no longer than 30 minutes at a time. If you're going to be sitting for extended periods, it's probably best to go without compression socks. Also, if you have varicose veins, don't wear them all day long. You could wind up with a painful spider vein breakout.</p><p>Stick to shorter bursts of activity and take frequent breaks from sitting to stretch your legs out. If you're a desk jockey, you might want to invest in a pair of thigh-high stockings to keep your legs warm and supported while working at a computer.</p><h3>What are the negative effects of compression socks?</h3><p>Can cause itching, redness, and irritation. Compression socks can aggravate skin irritation and also cause itching. When compression socks are improperly fitted, redness and temporary dents in your skin may appear on your legs at the edge of the sock's fabric. </p>"
chest rigs,"<h2>FAQs on Chest Rigs</h2><h3>Who invented chest rigs?</h3><p>While the Rhodesians are often credited with creating the chest rig during their Bush War, it was the Chinese Communists that first fielded them during the Viet Nam conflict. The size and curvature of AK-47 style magazines denied the use of belt-mounted carrying systems.</p><h3>What does a chest rig do?</h3><p>Chest rigs are a form of tactical gear storage that is mounted on the chest. These can be worn on top of a tactical vest, and sometimes come as a part of them. As we mentioned above one of the major benefits of chest rigs is that they allow you to carry a lot of tactical equipment, whilst keeping your hands free.</p><h3>What should be in a chest rig?</h3><p>The point of wearing a chest rig is to carry ammo and gear, which is done with the use of pouches. Most rigs will have at least a couple of rifle magazine pouches and one or two multi-purpose pouches. Other models will have pistol magazine pouches, radio pouches, or any number of utility pouches.</p><h3>How heavy is a chest rig?</h3><p>The weight of 660 gr / 1.45 lbs. is about standard for all chest rigs, and you won't have a problem of it being too heavy when you fill up the included pouches (unless you load it up with too many additional MOLLE pouches).</p><h3>What is the best type of chest rig?</h3><p>The most common type of chest rig is the power rack style, which uses a bar or bands to secure your arms and legs in place while you lift. Power racks are versatile and can be used for a variety of exercises, but they do require access to a power rack, so if you don't have one at home, it may not be an option.</p><h3>What is a micro chest rig?</h3><p>Quite simply, It's a small scale and low profile Chest Rig with a hot-swappable magazine insert system that allows carriage of Pistol, Subgun, Assault and Battle Rifle magazines.</p><h3>How do you set up a chest rig?</h3><p>Once you've got your rig and the items to go in it sorted, you'll need to fix it up.</p><p>In a nutshell, so the rig fits correctly and feels comfortable with the load compact and readily accessible. At the same time, so the weight is minimal, and well balanced.</p><h3>How much do chest rigs cost?</h3><ul><li>Budget chest rigs go for less than $75, but normally trade features and standards for affordable prices.</li><li>Mid-range chest rigs run to $150, but generally offer more features and improved quality.</li><li>Any more north a price and we're talking top-of-the-line chest rigs.</li></ul>"
hiking pants,"<h2>FAQs on Hiking Pants</h2><h3>Is it better to wear shorts or leggings when hiking?</h3><p>Both pants and shorts have their uses while hiking, but most people find that long pants provide more protection from the elements, including the rain, sun, and bugs. However, shorts are often more practical on hot days.</p><h3>What is the point of hiking pants?</h3><p>Leg Protection That is ""Cool"" - Because hiking pants breathe (sweat isn't trapped inside the pant), hiking pants keep the legs cool while still protecting the legs from twigs, thorns and other hazards found when hiking especially off-trail.</p><h3>What is the best fabric for hiking pants?</h3><p>Fabric choice depends heavily on what activities you plan to engage in while wearing them. Cotton and polyester are great options for most casual hikes, but nylon or wool will keep you warm and dry if you plan on doing more strenuous activities like mountain climbing or skiing.</p><h3>What kind of pants are best for hiking?</h3><p>Pants, which should be made of durable, quick-drying fabrics such as spandex or nylon (just as with your upper body, be sure to avoid cotton), should be worn if you expect any drop in temperature or heavy vegetation along the trail.</p><h3>Should hiking pants be tight or loose?</h3><p>The pants should be loose enough that they're not restricting movement but not so loose that they're just hanging from your legs and barely touching you. You might want to practice jogging around the store in them to make sure you can comfortably run, too.</p><h3>What color is best for hiking pants?</h3><p>In general, we prefer white, tan, beige, or other light-colored garments for hiking in the heat. We prefer black or different dark colors for hiking in colder seasons or higher altitudes. The color of your pants not only affects how hot they feel in the sun but also, how quickly they will dry out.</p><h3>Should you wear compression leggings when hiking?</h3><p>Compression pants are good for hiking if you want to avoid chafing, compress your muscles, and wick moisture away from your legs. They are not so good if you prefer looser fitting clothes.</p><h3>How tight should hiking pants be?</h3><p>Hiking pants should fit snugly enough where your legs aren't rubbing against your skin, but not so tight that they constrict circulation and make it harder to move. If you have a pair of athletic shorts, those might work as a base layer to wear under your regular pants. If you're looking for something more form-fitting, go with regular cut jeans. Avoid cargo-style legging pants, which hug your waist and leave little room for anything else. Also avoid sweatpants, unless they're made from technical fabrics like polyester or nylon that wick moisture away from your skin.</p>"
plate carriers,"<h2>FAQs on Plate Carriers</h2><h3>How do I wear a plate carrier?</h3><p>Plate carriers are designed to be worn over your regular clothes, with the exception of underwire bras. They're not intended to be seen underneath anything tight-fitting or revealing. If you plan to go swimming or work out in a tank top, you might want to consider going braless instead.</p><h3>What is the best material for a plate carrier?</h3><p>Plate carriers are made from a variety of materials, including neoprene, polyester, and stretchy nylon. Neoprene is the most common material used today, but it's also the most expensive. Polyester and nylon are cheaper options that provide similar support as neoprene, but they won't hold up to the same amount of abuse. Stretchy nylon is especially popular because it doesn't dig into your skin like neoprene does. It's also great for those who have sensitive skin.</p><p>The downside is that it doesn't offer nearly the same level of support as neoprene, so you'll need to add some form of padding if you plan to lift weights. Most manufacturers sell neoprene sleeves that fit over their standard plates. You can also get neoprene bands that wrap around your shins and attach to your plate with hooks and eyes. These are great for added support while lifting.</p><h3>Can I wear a Plate Carrier in the Army?</h3><p>Non-issued body armour and plate carriers are often not permitted in the army. However, it is dependent on the unit. Some task forces permit you to wear whatever you choose. In certain other units, everybody has their own Plate Carriers, and their army commander or unit head establishes their own regulations, either official or not.</p><h3>Can you bring a Plate Carrier on a plane?</h3><p>International travel to other countries, as well as domestic travel inside the country, entails rules that vary each country, with even larger variations for certain destinations. When it comes to body armour, each country has its own set of rules and regulations. You should study the rules of the state or countries you want to travel, as well as the legality and any related body armour restrictions.</p><p>If the nation you're travelling to prohibits civilian possession of body armour, you might be allowed to board the plane, but you could get in trouble once you arrive. Even if civilians are permitted to wear body armour in that nation, travel laws may prohibit them from doing so. Careful research can go a long way toward preventing avoidable issues.</p><h3>Can you dye a Plate Carrier?</h3><p>We can dye a plate carrier by bleaching it and then painting it with colour dyes. Spray paint could also be used to dye the plate carrier. Bleaching should be done with caution since it might permanently damage the fabric if done excessively.</p><h3>Can I wear a plate carrier with a backpack?</h3><p>A backpack is one that you can comfortably carry on your back without having to raise it with your chest, while yet fulfilling its purpose admirably. It simply has to fit on your back and be adjustable.</p><p>A backpack might also be used to transport more ammunition, an MRE, cold weather gear, hydration, or a raincoat. However, carrying a bulky backpack is cumbersome.</p><h3>Do plate carriers come with plates?</h3><p>Most plate carriers do not include body armour plates, which must be purchased individually. However, the fact that there is such a vast variety of body armour plates available is fantastic.</p><p>There are Lightweight foam plates which are ideal for training and can shield you from BBs or paintballs. There are also bullet-resistant steel plates to slow down and, presumably, block an actual bullet from penetrating. There is also anything that falls in the between.</p><h3>How can you wash a Plate Carrier?</h3><p>Maintaining your plate carrier in good condition might be the barrier between safety and equipment failure, or, at the very least, discomfort and a bad stench. Since your plate carrier is part of an official uniform, you'll be probably obligated to maintain it neat and in perfect condition. Keeping the plate carriers clean is indeed essential because properly cared for equipment last longer and keep you protected.</p>"
glock 19 holsters,"<h2>FAQs on Glock 19 Holsters</h2><h3>How To Conceal Carry a Glock 19?</h3><p>Conceal carrying a Glock 19 is very straightforward:</p><ol><li>Obtain a concealed carry permit (unless you live in Maine, Arizona, Kansas, Wyoming, Alaska, Vermont, Missouri)</li><li>Buy one of the concealed carry holsters that we've reviewed in this list.</li></ol><p>As a first holster, you can't go wrong with a Kydex IWB. If Kydex IWB doesn't work for you (usually it does), we recommend trying out a hybrid holster.</p><h3>What is the Angle/Cant of the holster?</h3><p>Most holsters will come with adjustable cant/angle. Cant is a personal preference and there is no right answer here.</p><p>With that being said, we recommend the 0 degree cant for most people. That way, if you need to draw and aim your Glock 19 fast, the tip of the gun travels less compared to a tilted cant. It's milliseconds that we're talking about here, but everything counts in a self defense situation.</p><h3>Is Glock 19 Good For Concealed Carry?</h3><p>Yes, Glock 19 is good for concealed carry for most people in most situations. Shooters with larger hands find the G19 to be a good compromise between full-size firearm and a smaller subcompact (carrying which would require adjusting your grip). It's not as compact as Glock 43, for example, but it's a good balance between size performance.</p><h3>Is Glock 19 Easy To Conceal?</h3><p>Glock 19 is easy to conceal carry for most people. It's only a tad bigger than other compact handguns, with a 4-inch barrel and a total length of 7.36 inches. Add to that 5 inches in height, and 1.18 inches in width at a slide - and you'll see that with these dimensions it's really not all that difficult to conceal in whichever holster you choose.</p><h3>Will A Glock 19X Fit In A Glock 19 Holster?</h3><p>Yes, Glock 19X will fit in a holster that's made for Glock 19. There are small differences between the two models, but nothing significant enough to change the holster fit.</p><h3>Will A Glock 19 Gen 4 Fit A Glock Gen 5 Holster?</h3><p>Yes, usually a Glock 19 Gen 4 will fit a Glock 19 Gen 5 holster, but it depends on the manufacturer of the holster. Of the holsters included in our list, most fit all generations of Glock 19 hosters. Concealment Express holsters, for example, fit Glock 19 1-5 gens while maintaining good retention. Check your holster manufacturer's specs to be sure.</p><h3>Is it hard to conceal-carry a Glock 19?</h3><p>As long as a good holster is selected, and it is worn with a proper cover garment, concealing a Glock 19 can be done even by smaller-framed people.</p><h3>Can you ankle-carry a Glock 19?</h3><p>You can, but you might have to look in the 1970s-era section of the thrift store for some pants that are flared wide enough.</p><h3>Do Navy SEALs use Glock 19s?</h3><p>Navy SEALs do, in fact, carry the Glock 19, as well as MARSOC and other SOF groups.</p><h3>Will the Glock 17 fit a Glock 19 holster?</h3><p>It depends, but generally speaking, no.</p>"
thermal scopes,"<h2>FAQs on Thermal Scopes</h2><h3>How long does a thermal scope last?</h3><p>Thermal scopes do not suffer from the same kind of degradation experienced by analog night vision devices. You're much more likely to trade up for a newer model than you are to experience a system failure.</p><h3>How far can you shoot with a thermal scope?</h3><p>In this case, range has far more to do with target identification than controlling your point of impact. Can you land rounds several hundred yards out? Sure. Can you tell what you're destroying? Probably not.</p><h3>Can thermal rifle scopes be used in daylight?</h3><p>Absolutely. Thermal imaging devices have been used by the military, law enforcement, and hunters for all kinds of daytime applications.</p><h3>What's the difference between night vision and thermal?</h3><p>To work properly, night vision requires nearby visible light. Thermal imaging doesn't require any light to work. Night vision works by amplifying visible light in the immediate vicinity. Thermal imaging uses infrared sensors to detect temperature differences between objects in its line of sight.</p><h3>Can you see a snake with a thermal scope?</h3><p>Modern thermal imaging cameras for hunting allow you to detect a thermal target in all light conditions. Grass and bushes are not significant obstacles. However, a thermal imaging camera will not be enough for snake detection.</p><h3>Can thermal scope see through trees?</h3><p>Thermal imaging cannot see through trees (or wood), but it can be helpful for spotting people in forested areas where their heat signatures stand out much more than a visible image might.</p><h3>Can thermal scopes see through clothes?</h3><p>No, thermal imaging cameras can detect the temperature of the cloth but will not see through it.</p><h3>What can damage a thermal scope?</h3><p>While it might be expected that rain and wind can damage a poorly designed or poorly assembled camera, the sun is also capable of damaging the sensitive thermal detector in certain thermal imaging cameras not designed to the standards that Flir Systems maintains.</p>"
solar generators,"<h2>FAQs on Solar Generators</h2><h3>Do solar generators really work?</h3><p>Yes, solar generators do really work, but they need to be used with high-capacity solar panels in good condition. Aim for 100-watts solar panels or more and expose them to at least 6-8 hours of sunlight every day. If you live in a cloudy area, you may struggle to harness enough sunlight, so keep that in mind.</p><h3>What to Look For When Buying A Solar Powered Generator?</h3><p>Always Go Portable</p><p>Whether you need a solar generator to take camping, load aboard your boat, or keep it at your home as backup power, you need a product you can carry relatively easily. If you're an outdoorsy type, you already have a lot of gear to haul around, and to be honest, a solar generator is not the lightest item on the list.</p><h3>What To Avoid When Choosing A Solar Generator?</h3><p> Although these batteries use a reliable and time-tested technology and cost less than any type of lithium battery, in my opinion, lead-acids have had their heyday and now it's time for retirement.</p><p>Not only do;lead-acid batteries weigh more than lithium batteries, but they are also moe sensitive to the depth of discharge (DoD).</p><p>If you regularly discharge the battery completely, you are reducing the number of life cycles. The manufacturers usually recommend discharging lead-acid cells to only 50% of their capacity.</p><h3>Can a solar generator power a house?</h3><p>No, a solar generator cannot power a house. The unit may be able to temporarily power certain household appliances (like your TV unit) and handheld items like power tools, but you cannot expect a solar generator to power everything long-term. It will run out of energy before it can keep up.</p><h3>What size of solar generator do I need?</h3><p>You need a solar generator that matches your power requirements. If you're just going on a camping trip, a 500W generator would be plenty. If you're looking for emergency power in power outages, you ideally want 2000W or higher.</p><h3>Do I need a generator if I have solar panels?</h3><p>Yes, you need a generator even if you have solar panels on top of your home. In the event of a power cut, your home will lose power just like any other regular home. In this case, it's best to have a generator as a backup.</p><p>Can a solar generator power a freezer?</p><p>A solar generator can power a freezer, though it may not be for very long depending on the size of the generator and the freezer. A 1500W solar generator could power a large chest freezer for around 3 hours before the battery dies.</p><p>Will a 20kW generator run my house?</p><p>A 20kW generator will run most things in your house. You can expect a 20kW generator to keep your lights on, your electronics working, and your A/C working. If you have a smaller home, you might even be able to power the entire house as normal.</p><p>On the other hand, lead-acid is still fine for your car as the battery is taking charge as you drive so the capacity rarely drops under 50%.</p>"
hiking socks,"<h2>FAQs on Hiking Socks</h2><h3>How tight should hiking socks be?</h3><p>Hiking socks are designed to fit snugly around your calf and shin, but not so tight as to constrict circulation or cause chafing. If you plan to hike in the summer months, look for lightweight 4- to 6-inch (10 to 15 cm) high-tensile nylon socks that allow plenty of airflow and wick moisture away from your skin.</p><h3>How many pairs of socks should you wear when hiking?</h3><p>When it comes to preventing blisters while hiking, shoes get the most attention. However, if you don't have the right socks, you'll still get blisters. Many experienced hikers wear two pairs of socks to prevent blisters.</p><h3>How often should you change your socks while hiking?</h3><p>You also want to make sure to have extra sets of socks with you on your hike. Change them whenever you feel hot spots or blisters, and some folks recommend pre-emptively changing them every 4-6 miles no matter what. When you change socks, clip the dirty/sweaty ones to your pack to dry them out.</p><h3>How do you wash hiking socks?</h3><p>Machine-wash on gentle cycle in warm or cool water(avoid hot water as heat may shrink wool). Use mild soap, no bleach or fabric softener (bleach destroys the Merino wool fibers, and fabric softener coats those fibers reducing their ability to naturally manage moisture and regulate body temperature).</p><h3>What happens if you leave socks on for too long?</h3><p>It can cause general puffiness or swelling in the hands, feet, or face. This symptom can occur when a person has been standing or sitting for too long. It can also happen during menstruation.</p><h3>What is the best fabric for hiking socks?</h3><p>There are several fabrics used for hiking socks, including polyester, cotton, and wool. Wool is by far the most durable and versatile material. Cotton is a great option if you're looking for something breathable and lightweight. Polyester is a good option if you want something that dries quickly and resists odor.</p><p>Make sure you choose a fabric that works well with your skin type. If you have sensitive skin, avoid wearing nylon or polyester socks.</p><h3>Are merino wool socks good for summer?</h3><p>Contrary to what many people think, merino wool can be an excellent material for summer socks, especially when combined with more durable and abrasion-resistant materials. 100% merino wool socks are soft and comfortable, should not itch, do not retain odors, and have excellent moisture management properties.</p><p>However, they aren't very durable or abrasion-resistant, which can dramatically reduce the length of the useful life of the 100% merino wool socks. Moreover, they can be too hot in the summer. For this reason, super-fine merino is often combined with synthetic fibers such as nylon and polyester.</p><h3>Are wool socks good for winter?</h3><p>Wool is a great option for winter socks, especially merino wool. It's also one of the best materials for warm socks because of its softness, warmth, insulating and antimicrobial properties, moisture-wicking and relatively quick-drying abilities, etc. Wool has another excellent property - it feels warm even when wet and, unlike cotton, it doesn't lose its insulating properties. Merino wool is even finer, softer, more comfortable, and less likely to irritate the skin fiber than traditional sheep's wool. Alpaca wool is another great kind of wool suitable for winter (note that it's much rare to find socks with alpaca wool than socks with merino wool). It's a soft and silky natural fiber that similarly to the sheep's wool retains heat without weight and has great insulating properties. The difference is that high-quality alpaca wool is even lighter and warmer.</p>"
flashlights,"<h2>FAQs on Flashlights</h2><h3>How do you turn a flashlight on?</h3><p>You can either press the button or flick the switch to activate the flashlight. If you have a rechargeable flashlight, you'll want to make sure that it's fully charged before using it in low light conditions.</p><h3>What was the first flashlight?</h3><p>In 1899, the first flashlight was invented. It was powered by a battery due to the invention of miniature incandescent light bulb and dry cell.</p><h3>What are the elements of a flashlight?</h3><p>The elements of flashlights include a switch, a battery, a reflector, a transparent cover, and a light bulb.</p><h3>How useful are flashlights?</h3><p>In addition to lighting the way at night, flashlights can be used to find people who require rescue, and a great tool for people who need rescuing to signal for help. If you are stranded at night without a flashlight, it is nearly impossible for rescuers to see you.</p><h3>What are qualities of a good flashlight?</h3><p>A good flashlight will have a very strong beam once focused all the way. This is great for doing very close up and detailed work. And when it is placed on the most wide setting, the light encompasses a very large area. A flashlight is an important and effective tool to have.</p><h3>What is the longest-lasting flashlight?</h3><p>Battery life is affected by so many things that it's hard to definitively say that one flashlight lasts the longest. What we can say is that a rechargeable flashlight and a solar power bank belong in everyone's survival kit or go-bag.</p><h3>How many lumens should a good flashlight have?</h3><p>If you're working in confined spaces and want to preserve some semblance of night vision, you might want a flashlight that can achieve double-digit lumen output. On the other hand, if you need to see across large, open areas, having 750 to 1,000 lumens to work with is a good idea.</p><h3>Where can I purchase bulbs for my flashlight?</h3><p>Bulbs can be purchased at most mass merchandising stores, hardware stores, and home improvement centers throughout the world.</p><h3>What is the difference between a tactical flashlight and a regular flashlight?</h3><p>The main difference between tactical flashlights and EDC flashlights is simply the use case. While EDC is more focused on features, tactical is more focused on instant access to strobe or turbo mode.</p><h3>Why do police hold flashlights high?</h3><p>It allows them to illuminate the area in front of them and see around corners and into the distance. This also helps to prevent accidents. It is much easier to shine the light down into a vehicle as a self-defense measure with this grip.</p>"

A good checkbook wallet will have a slot for your checkbook (travelers' checks or otherwise) or cash, as well as cards and ID. These wallets are not considered billfolds because, well, they don't fold your bills.</p><h3>What is the purpose of putting a crayon in your wallet?</h3><p>To prevent your credit cards from bending<br />It's the idea of carrying a crayon in your wallet to help prevent your business cards and credit cards from taking the shape of your wallet. Even for this, though, it's best to have a piece of paper wrapped around the crayon.</p><h3>How do I clean my wallet?</h3><p>Wipe off any dirt with a soft cloth and then hang it in the sun to dry out. Avoid using harsh chemicals as they could damage leather or rubber components of your wallet. If you're concerned about germs, use a fresh antibacterial wipe instead.</p><h3>Why do cards get dirty in wallet?</h3><p>A bulky wallet will not close properly and will bend your cards inside, thus damaging them over time. When coins are stored in adjacent pockets along with the cards, the coin shapes will get imprinted on the cards if you normally sit on your wallet.</p><h3>How much should I spend on a good quality wallet?</h3><p>If you want something that can hold everything from business cards to loose change, expect to pay between $50 and $150 for most manufacturers' premium leather or nylon wallets. For those who don't need to carry around their driver's license, state ID, and/or credit cards, expect to pay closer to $30 for most budget-friendly options. Premium materials and construction will cost you extra, but will last for years if taken care of properly. You'll also want to spring for a few bucks for a case of thin lining material to protect against scratches and scuffs. That's another $20 to $30.</p>"
uv flashlights,"<h2>FAQs on UV Flashlights</h2><h3>What exactly is a UV flashlight?</h3><p>A UV flashlightemits ultraviolet radiation - a type of light energy - that is not visible to the human eye. When ultraviolet light hits certain objects, they can fluoresce - a phenomenon similar to a bright glow.</p><h3>What is the difference between UV light and normal light?</h3><p>So, the difference between ordinary light and ultraviolet light is that the ordinary light is visible and consists of light of various colours as mentioned above while ultraviolet light is invisible and has wavelength less than ordinary light but energy more than ordinary light.</p><h3>What can a UV flashlight detect?</h3><p>The lights cause materials such as bacteria, urine, seminal fluids and blood, to """"fluoresce,"""" so that the naked eye can detect them. Typically, UV lights are used to test surfaces especially when there is a disease outbreak or any sudden increase in occurrences of a specific disease at a particular time or place.</p><h3>Is a UV flashlight the same as a black light?</h3><p>To put it simply, black light is a type of ultraviolet light - specifically, ultraviolet A (UVA) light, where it emits ultraviolet radiation in the UVA band. These rays are low-energy and long-wavelength and are the least harmful as far as ultraviolet radiation is concerned.</p><h3>Are LED flashlights UV?</h3><p>For the majority of LED light bulbs, in industrial applications and otherwise, they do not give off UV radiation. In earlier incarnations of LED lighting the reason they did not emit UV radiation was their inability to give off white light.</p><h3>What should I look for when buying a UV flashlight?</h3><p>Therefore, it is important that you purchase a UV flashlight with a wavelength at or near 365 nm - otherwise, the UV energy produced by the flashlight may be completely useless and producing the fluorescent glow you are looking for.</p><h3>Can I get UV light on my phone?</h3><p>While no smartphone is technically capable of emitting UV light currently, you can mimic the effect of a black light using your phone's LED flash, a few markers, and some transparent tape.</p><h3>Does it matter which UV flashlight I use?</h3><p>Because UV flashlights vary in their type and quality, it can be difficult to know if, and which UV flashlights will work for your particular use case without looking at the specifications.</p><h3>Are black lights just UV lights?</h3><p>In a nutshell, there isn't quite a difference, but a misunderstanding of the terms. Black light is nothing but UVA light, while UV light is basically composed out of UVA, UVB and UVC. So in other words, black light is UV light(450-100nm), covering the 400-320nm spectrum.</p><h3>Can I run my house on solar power?</h3><p>Yes, but you'll need to do some serious research before making any big changes to your utility bill. It's possible to get away with small changes like running your refrigerator on electricity instead of gas, but</p><h3>Are UV Lights dangerous?</h3><p>The UV-A LED flashlights and ""black lights"" evaluated to date by APHC (Prov)'s Nonionizing Radiation Program (NRP) pose some risk, but would not cause injury during normal use. The safety limits would only be exceeded if prolonged or many repeated exposures occurred.</p>"

Fishing- The reflective material can sometimes be more effective at luring fish in than simply a hook.</p><h3>Are all emergency blankets the same?</h3><p>There are several types of emergency blankets but essentially they work the same. Their primary goal is to prevent heat-loss by retaining up to 90% of your current body heat. They're not designed to produce more warmth.</p><h3>How do you use an emergency blanket?</h3><p>The most important thing when using an emergency blanket is to maintain a steady, comfortable temperature. The blanket should feel warm and not constricting, but not so loose that it flops around like a ragdoll. If the blanket feels too tight, it could restrict your breathing and circulation, which could be dangerous in an emergency.</p><h3>What property is important for the material used as emergency blanket?</h3><p>Reflective properties: The blanket's aluminum material is reflective. As such, you can either use it to reflect your body's heat back to you or reflect heat away from you.</p><h3>How long do survival blankets last?</h3><p>Emergency blankets expire within two years of being produced, but opening the package will shorten their lifespan. Misuse and improper storage can shorten their longevity, making them much less effective at reflecting heat. If the blanket looks dull or loses its shine, it's time to replace it.</p><h3>Do emergency blankets tear easily?</h3><p>Cheap emergency blankets are much thinner than a higher-quality thermal blanket oremergency sleeping bag and they're also not coated with any sort of protective material making them tear and puncture resistant.</p><h3>Do emergency blankets actually work?</h3><p>Emergency blankets work, but you still must use them with the fundamentals of survival and in conjunction with some type of shelter to survive the elements.</p><h3>Are emergency blankets worth it?</h3><p>There's a lot of great things about Emergency Blankets. They're 90% heat reflective, so they can help you stay cozy warm at sporting events, keep you from becoming an icicle if your vehicle breaks down this winter, or provide life-saving warmth if you spend an unexpected night in the backcountry.</p><h3>What are emergency blankets made of?</h3><p>Most emergency blankets are made of Mylar, which is a lightweight material that does an excellent job of reflecting body heat.</p><h3>Can you use an emergency blanket more than once?</h3><p>The material is definitely durable enough to use more than once. This versatile blanket can be placed in your car to use if you are stranded in bad/cold weather. You can fold it up and take it in your backpack while hiking or stash it in your coat pocket while skiing.</p>"
nerf guns,"<h2>FAQs about Nerf Guns</h2><h3>How do you aim a nerf gun?</h3><p>You hold the trigger back and squeeze the orange grip to fire. The dart will fly forward and then curve slightly downward before impacting its target. If you are firing at something that is moving, the dart may not hit its target due to the speed of the projectile and the time it takes for the dart to reach full velocity. To improve your accuracy, practice with targets that are stationary or moving slowly.</p><h3>What size should my nerf gun be?</h3><p>Your weapon's length will determine how comfortable you can hold it while aiming and shooting. Most manufacturers offer their guns in either 12-inch (30cm) or 15-inch (38cm) lengths. Some offer 20-inch (51cm) or 24-inch (61cm) variants as well. Make sure to measure your hand around the grip before ordering to ensure you get the right fit. Also, check out this handy video from Nerf HQ on proper grip placement.</p><h3>Can I use real bullets in my nerf gun?</h3><p>Yes, if you so choose. However, we recommend sticking with foam darts unless you're willing to clean up the mess they leave behind. They also don't pack much punch, so you might find yourself shooting holes in things you didn't intend to. That said, there are times when real bullets are useful, especially for training purposes. For instance, if you want to teach your child how to defend themselves against an attacker, having them practice with foam darts won't help them learn how to effectively use a firearm. However, if you want to train for self-defense, having real ammunition available could be helpful. Just make sure to keep it away from small children and pets.</p><h3>Do NERF guns make a lot of noise?</h3><p>On the whole, blasters don't make much noise at all. In fact it is much more likely going to be you causing a ruckus (shouting and shrieking etc.) than the gun itself.</p><p>Your standard NERF gun is going to have a few audible clicks and clacks but nothing which is going to disturb your neighbours. However, if you are really worried about noise we would recommend you avoid any of the motorized blasters as these guns do emit a whirring noise as the motor gets up to speed.</p><h3>What is the youngest age that players can be?</h3><p>Ideally, there is no minimum age, but I often find children younger than 5 struggle or are unable to use the guns. If you're unsure, call us for a chat!</p><h3>How dangerous is Nerf?</h3><p>Not at all! Nerf guns fling foam darts and do not hurt. For younger kids, they may sometimes experience an initial shock and act like it hurts, but more often than not they will keep playing despite any tears!</p><h3>What is a good location for a Nurf party?</h3><p>I usually find that your local community centres, dance halls or sports halls are great for our Nerf Surge parties. If you are struggling to find a good location, we are more than happy to help source one for you.</p>"

tactical belts,"<h2>FAQs about Tactical Belts</h2><h3>How tight should a tactical belt be?</h3><p>A good rule of thumb is to make sure your pants won't fall off when you sit down. If that's too snug, then go with something more comfortable like the Army Field Manual III.</p><h3>What are the benefits of wearing a tactical belt?</h3><p>The main benefit of wearing a tactical belt is that it provides additional carrying capacity for items like magazines and comms while keeping your hands free to operate weapons or tools. It also helps maintain body heat and can help keep you from getting injured by an IED or other attacker.</p><p>Finally, it adds a layer of protection between your equipment and your body, which could save your life if you were ever attacked. The downside is that they're not very comfortable unless you get one custom-made to fit your exact measurements.</p><h3>Are tactical belts worth it?</h3><p>Yes! They're a great investment and can serve as a lifesaving device in the right hands at the right time. Make sure you practice safe gun handling techniques before wearing yours on the field, though.</p><h3>Does a tactical belt go through belt loops?</h3><p>Some do, as with most of the tactical gun belts on this list, but there are belts like the PHLster Enigma that go inside your clothes, and gun belts, which go over an inner belt and use Velcro to stay attached.</p><h3>Why are tactical belts so expensive?</h3><p>Things like durability and rigidity are paramount with tactical belts, so greater care has to be taken to make them stand up to heavy use, rather than just look the part. Things like stiffening layers, durable leather or nylon, and dense stitching cost money.</p><h3>Can you put a holster on a tactical belt?</h3><p>Yes, that's the purpose.</p><h3>How Wide Are Tactical Belts?</h3><p>Tactical belts, especially the EDC type, have a width of 1.5 inches. Rigger's belts can go around 1.75 inches wide, while the duty belts are at least 2 inches wide.</p><h3>How to wear a frame buckle belt?</h3><p>Here are the steps to wear a frame buckle belt:</p><li>Step 1: Run the tactical belt through the pants.</li><li>Step 2: Run the tail through the lower part of the buckle while keeping the prong open.</li><li>Step 3: Pull the tail to fix to your preferred length.</li><li>Step 4: Secure the belt by stringing the prong over the opening on the suitable end tip on the belt.</li><li>Step 5: Run the excess tail through the loops on the pants.</li></ul>"
backpacking sleeping pads,"<h2>FAQs on Backpacking Sleeping Pads</h2><h3>How do you pack a sleeping pad in a backpack?</h3><p>Fold up your sleeping pad and place it inside the pack against your back to create a padded frame as well as an extra layer between your gear and your back. This works well with air pads that can be folded in half or in thirds to fit into your pack.</p><h3>How do I protect my sleeping pad?</h3><p>Expanding upon that idea, layering also offers protection. Sliding a closed cell foam pad under your pad will boost your R-value and help prevent anything from pricking your pad from below.</p><h3>How long does it take for a sleeping pad to inflate?</h3><p>Generally, it takes 5-15 minutes for any of our self-inflating pads to inflate under their own volition. That 10-minute range variance is probably due to one of the following factors: core construction, trained compression, elevation and temperature.</p><h3>What size sleeping pad do I need?</h3><p>If you plan to go multi-day hiking or camping, you'll want a large sleeping pad. If you're going on a one- or two-day excursion, a small sleeping pad will suffice.</p><h3>Can sleeping pad get wet?</h3><p>Your foam pad can get wet- Because your foam sleeping pad straps to the outside of your pack, it can get wet in the rain, even if you use a pack cover. This water could transfer to your sleeping bag if you can't get the pad dry before you're ready to go to bed.</p><h3>How do I check my sleeping pad for leaks?</h3><p>If you can't find the leak by sponging soapy water onto the pad, then submerge the pad. Squeeze it gently as you methodically check for leaks in different areas of the pad.</p><h3>How thick should a sleeping pad be?</h3><p>2.5 inches: The new standard for air pads and self-inflating pads. This thickness boosts you off the ground, allows lots of air for insulation, and isn't so high that it's bouncy. Many pads, especially air pads, fall into this category, and are quite comfortable. 3 inches: Pushing the envelope is the 3-inch pad.</p><h3>What does R-value mean in sleeping pads?</h3><p>Thermal Resistance</p><p>Sleeping pads help to insulate you from the ground. Technically speaking, an R-value measures how well an object resists (hence the R"""") heat (this measurement isn't only used on sleeping pads - it quantifies thermal resistance in windows, housing insulation, and much more).</p><h3>How much does a sleeping pad cost?</h3><p>Most manufacturers offer their products for between $100 and $150. That's not bad considering how comfortable they are and how light they are compared to traditional sleeping bags. The high end of the spectrum is reserved for premium materials like down and synthetic materials that help keep you warm and insulated from the elements.</p><p>Premium down sleeping bags can easily reach $300 to $400. For those who don't care about down quality, there are plenty of good synthetic options available for around $100 to $150. Some manufacturers offer free shipping and/or offer discounts for bulk purchases.</p>"
self defense keychains,"<h2>FAQs about Self-defense Keychains</h2><h3>How do I store my keys?</h3><p>Your keys should be stored somewhere secure, but not where they can easily be stolen. If you keep them in your purse or pocket, make sure you use a good quality lock.</p><h3>What is the best way to defend myself against an attacker?</h3><p>Defend yourself with whatever works for you. Stick him in the throat, kick him in the balls, bite his ear off, whatever works for you. Make sure you get a good grip on him and don't let go until he releases you. If he doesn't release you, then it's game over.</p><h3>Are self-defense keychains considered weapons?</h3><p>At first glance, they look like harmless cat or dog keychains. But as it turns out, they're actually used as a deadly self-defense weapon. Deputies say they're known as Plastic Knuckle Dusters, which fall under the umbrella of brass knuckles, which are illegal in the state of California.</p><h3>Why is self defense keychain important?</h3><p>A self-defense keychain is the ultimate personal safety gadget. This highly portable weapon will increase your chance of survival and give you time to escape to safety.</p><h3>What are the five elements of self-defense?</h3><p>There are five inter-related elements necessary to justify use of deadly force in self-defense: Innocence, imminence, proportionality, avoidance and reasonableness. They are well illustrated here. Of these five elements, the overriding one here and in most cases is reasonableness.</p><h3>What are self-defense rounds called?</h3><p>hollow point ammo</p><p>Self-defense ammunition is often known as hollow point ammo, but bullet technology has come a long way and this isn't always the case. Some types of self-defense ammo are designed in such a way that they cause internal damage differently, like using the bullet's rotation along with channels built into it.</p><h3>How many rounds should you carry for self-defense?</h3><p>In the overwhelming majority of the incidents where an armed civilian fires a shot in self-defense, probably 70 to 90% of them are able to resolve the situation within 3 or 4 rounds, and usually closer to one or two rounds. Every once in awhile, the good guy fires more like 5 to 8 rounds.</p><h3>How to choose the best self-defense keychain?</h3><p>When you're purchasing a self-defense keychain set, look if they offer:</p><ul><li>Sturdy tools.</li><li>A variety of tools to your liking.</li><li>Customizations with color, sizes, etc.</li><li>Tools that fit your hands.</li><li>Tools that don't attract too much attention.</li></ul><h3>How to use a self-defense keychain?</h3><p>Women are naturally trained to wrap their fingers around a keychain in case someone tries to tackle them. You can use your self-defense keychain set the same way you'd use your normal keychain.</p><p>Be that as it may, having some knowledge on where to punch or hit with your keychain can give you the upper hand during a critical situation.</p><p>For instance, say an attacker grabs you from behind, you can point your keychain towards their elbow. If you encounter the attacker face-to-face, your best bet is the facial area, neck, or chest. Always aim for areas that are least covered, so the tools in the keychain can penetrate the attacker's skin.</p><p>Always carry your keychain on your palm. Don't put it inside your purse or bag, since this can give your attacker the green light to pursue you faster.</p><p>Note that safety keychain sets aren't lethal, but when used with proper force and precision, you can do serious damage to your attacker despite their physical build. However, don't try to tackle the assailant. As soon as they back down from your attack, run to safety and notify the local authorities.</p>"
rangefinders for hunting,"<h2>FAQs on Rangefinders for Hunting</h2><h3>What is the difference between a spotting scope and a rangefinder?</h3><p>Spotting scopes are designed to be used in short-range, close-up situations. Rangefinders are designed to be used in long-range, open-area situations.</p><h3>Are rangefinders worth it for hunting?</h3><p>Carrying a rangefinder helps you eliminate uncertainty about distances when shooting rifles or bows. When you know the actual distance to the target, you'll have more confidence in taking the shot or you'll know that it's too far away to risk it.</p><h3>How do I use a rangefinder?</h3><p>Follow the directions provided by the manufacturer or someone who has used one before you. Most rangefinders have a similar setup with a base unit that houses the reticle and prism, and a telescopic unit that magnifies the target area and provides a clear sight picture for follow-up shots. Make sure to zero your rangefinder before each hunt using the directions provided by the manufacturer or someone who has used one before you. If you don't, you could wind up shooting way off.</p><h3>How accurate is a rangefinder?</h3><p>Rangefinders vary from very accurate to less so, but most fall somewhere in the mid-to-high single digits. That said, there's a lot of variation depending on the magnification level, whether it's optical or laser, and how many times the reticle is adjusted during the sweep of the gun barrel. Accuracy can also degrade over time due to dirt buildup and other factors.</p><p>The best way to tell if a rangefinder is accurate enough for your needs is to try it out at the range and see how far you can reliably hit targets. If you can consistently hit targets at 25 yards, then you should be fine. If not, you may want to look at something else.</p><h3>Do you need a slope on a rangefinder?</h3><p>It depends on your terrain. If you plan to hunt from an elevated position or you're roving through mountainous terrain, you'll probably want to have a rangefinder that accounts for slope and calculates your distance using Angle Compensation.</p><h3>How long do laser rangefinders last?</h3><p>Like anything, the better you care for it, the longer it will last. That said, when I asked Google this same question, the most common answer was about five years, but this probably has a lot to do with the frequency of use as well.</p><h3>How do you bow hunt without a rangefinder?</h3><p>Some bowhunters, especially treestand hunters, circumvent the need for rangefinders by pre-marking range distances within their field of fire. This can be done by measuring the distance from the base of your tree to prominent features (like trees, rocks, fences, etc.) in the surrounding area. Having these known distances to key features can help a bowhunter estimate their target's distance by means of comparison.</p><h3>Can you put a magnet on a rangefinder?</h3><p>The silicone band attach around your rangefinder like a watch, and with the strong magnet within the band: you can stick it to a cart pole, irons or use the included adhesive magnetic plate to put it on your pull or push cart console.</p>"
long range walkie talkies,"<h2>FAQs about Long Range Walkie Talkies</h2><h3>What is the longest range that a walkie-talkie can transmit on a single frequency?</h3><p>The answer to this question depends on what you mean by """"range."""" If you're referring to the physical distance between the two devices, then the answer is 10 miles. If you're referring to the effective range of the device's speaker, then it's more like 15 to 20 feet.</p><h3>What Is A Two Way Radio?</h3><p>Two way radios, sometimes referred to informally as walkie talkies, are devices which enable users to keep in constant contact with each other. They use radio waves to communicate, meaning that they are not reliant on mobile phone signal. This means that they are often able to communicate in areas where mobile phone coverage may be patchy, such as remote locations.</p><p>You'll find two way radios used in almost every area of industry. For example, two way radios are often used in retail for communication between shop floor staff and warehouse staff, as well as by the security staff. They are also used in the transport sector, where they facilitate a continuous channel of communication between drivers and control staff.</p><p><h3>What is the longest two-way radio range?</h3></p><p>So realistically, for two people carrying a handheld two-way radio, the maximum communication distance on flat ground with no obstructions is around 4 to 6 miles. So you may be wondering why you see radios that have range claims of 25 miles or higher.</p><p><h3>What affects the range of a walkie talkie?</h3></p><p>The usable range of a walkie talkie is limited by a large host of factors, and most of these factors are very hard to quantify. Factors like the weather, the geometry of the landscape around you, the type of obstructions in the landscape, noise from other radio signals, and your elevation all play a factor.</p><p><h3>How many watts is a good walkie talkie?</h3></p><p>Most handheld two-way radios on the market today use between 0.5-5 watts of power to broadcast a signal. Some business radios are designed to run on slightly more power - between 1-5 watts depending on the model. In general, a higher wattage allows for greater range.</p><h3>Walkie Talkie Vs Two Way Radio - Is There A Difference?</h3><p>Many people wonder whether there is a difference between walkie talkies and two way radios. Of course, you need to know that you're buying the right type of device to keep your employees connected.The truth is, 'walkie talkie"""" is just another name for a two way radio. Whilst two way radio is usually seen as the official term for this type of communication device, some people like to refer to them more informally as walkie talkies. There's no right or wrong, but both names refer to the same thing.</p><h3>Do You Need A Licence For Walkie Talkies?</h3><p><p>Whether or not you'll need a licence for your two way radios will depend on the frequency on which you plan to communicate. There are eight licence-free radio channels in the UK that can be freely used by anyone with a two way radio. However, these channels can quickly become congested, meaning that you'll hear other conversations as well as your own. This also means that your channel of communication will not be private, as anyone can tune in and listen.</p><p>If you need a private channel of communication, you'll need to opt for a licensed two way radio system. You can apply for this licence from Ofcom.</p></p>"
solar phone chargers,"<h2>FAQs on Solar Phone Chargers</h2><h3>How long does it take to charge a phone with a solar charger?</h3><p>The batteries that they are charging generally have a very large capacity. So charging them completely takes a significant amount of power. As an estimate, a fully charged portable solar panel will recharge a phone with 5% battery life to full battery life in about two to three hours.</p><h3>Is it good to charge phone in solar system?</h3><p>Solar chargers used to charge a phone directly, rather than by using an internal battery, can damage a phone if the output is not well-controlled, for example by supplying excessive voltage in bright sunlight.</p><h3>What size solar panel do I need to charge a cell phone?</h3><p>A wattage between 10 watts and 15 watts of power is a good rule of thumb when looking for a solar phone charger.</p><h3>Can solar charger damage phone battery?</h3><p>Solar chargers used to charge a phone directly, rather than by using an internal battery, can damage a phone if the output is not well-controlled, for example by supplying excessive voltage in bright sunlight.</p><h3>How do I know what size solar charger I need?</h3><p>Take the power produced by the solar panels and divide by the voltage of the batteries. For example: Example: A solar array is producing 1 kw and charging a battery bank of 24V. The controller size is then 1000/24 = 41.67 amps.</p><h3>What happens to solar power when batteries are full?</h3><p>Solar power systems use batteries to store solar energy. However, if the power generated exceeds the solar battery's capacity, it can overcharge the system. An overcharged solar system can severely damage a battery's life.</p><h3>Can you leave a solar charger on all the time?</h3><p>In general, a solar trickle charger can be left connected to a battery all the time. Most commercial chargers are designed to either generate very low power or incorporate over-charge protection. It's always preferable to use a simple solar charge controller with any solar charging application.</p><h3>What can damage solar battery?</h3><p>Constant overcharging will damage your solar battery and consequently shorten its life. Lead-Acid can be trickle-charged, but a lower voltage is applied. If the voltage doesn't decrease once the lead-acid battery is fully charged, it will be overcharged.</p><h3>What is the difference between a solar charger and a solar power bank?</h3><p>Solar power banks store generated energy in built-in batteries, so you can charge devices even when there's no sun. Solar chargers are designed without batteries and do not store energy. They have to be exposed to sunlight when they're charging your devices.</p><h3>Can I take a solar phone charger on a plane?</h3><p>All Voltaic solar panels, solar chargers, and battery packs are TSA approved for both domestic and international flights.</p>"

field watches,"<h2>FAQs on Field Watches</h2><h3>What is a field watch?</h3><p>Field watches are simple military watches. Field watches were designed for soldiers to wear during the world wars, so they took on this name based on how they were used. The name evolved into field watches to show how the watch could be used by a wide range of people.</p><h3>What makes a field watch a field watch?</h3><p>Put simply, field watches are durable, accurate timepieces invented for military purposes. Furthermore, historically, soldiers have enjoyed the large dial, stainless steel case, and glare-proof crystal that often comes with a great military field watch. Today, you can enjoy these benefits too!</p><h3>Are field watches casual?</h3><p>Luckily, there is one type of watch that won't necessitate an arm transplant; field watches. Indeed, these casual, military-themed pieces are versatile in both style and size, with many available in smaller diameters that suit even the narrowest of arms.</p><h3>What makes a good field watch?</h3><p>Typically, a good field watch has a stainless steel case, canvas or leather band, and quality movement. It must be easy to read with glare-proof crystal, a high contrast dial, luminous hands, and large numerals. Above all, the field watch is built to withstand tough conditions.</p><h3>What size should a field watch be?</h3><p>Most modern field watches take inspiration from these two designs. The major differences being size and movement. The originals were 36mm cases with handwound movements, while the modern versions are in the 38-44mm range and usually feature automatic or quartz movements.</p><h3>How much do field watches cost?</h3><p>Field watches are generally affordable, costing between $150 and $300. Mid-tier watches can go up to $500, while high-end watches cost more than $600. The price of a watch will vary depending on the brand, style, materials, and finishing details used. For example, stainless steel bracelets might cost less than a gold plated bracelet with diamonds.</p><h3>Should field watches be small?</h3><p>Field watches are generally smaller, generally for the stated reason that they need to be wearable for many different body types, and need to not snag on anything while in use, given their heritage as general-issue military watches. However, larger options are fine and are just as much a field watch as a 36mm or 38mm.</p><h3>What is the best time for a field watch?</h3><p>Field watches are designed to be worn during physically demanding activities like hunting, fishing, or military service. That said, they're also great for everyday use as well. If you work in an office all day, but want to look rugged when you head out at lunchtime, a field watch could be just what you need. If you spend most of your time on the water, though, stick with something that's water resistant to 30ATM.

spotting scope tripods,"<h2>FAQs about Spotting Scope Tripods</h2><h3>What is the best type of tripod for spotting?</h3><p>There are several types of tripods available, but the most common are the three-legged folding variety and four-legged fixed-angle variety. The three-legged folding variety has a center leg that folds up when collapsed, and the fourth leg can be folded down to provide additional stability.</p><h3>What should I look for in a spotting scope tripod?</h3><p>To find the right tripods for spotting scope we considered multiple factors, including:</p><ul><li>Stability.</li><li>Load capacity.</li><li>Adjustable height range.</li><li>Portability.</li><li>Ease of use.</li></ul><h3>How tall should a tripod spotting scope be?</h3><p>To calculate the tripod height you need, work downward from the top of your head. Your eyes are about 4 to 5 inches from the top of your head. The scope eyepiece is about 4 inches above the bottom of the scope's mount plate, and the tripod head is about 4 to 4.5 inches high.</p><h3>Is it better to mount a scope high or low?</h3><p>As a general rule it is best to keep your scopes objective lens as close to the barrel as possible so therefore low or medium height scope mounts are a popular choice.</p><h3>Do you need a tripod for spotting scope?</h3><p>Spotting scope tripod is often overlooked but probably the most important part of your optics regimen.

We recommend purchasing a quick-release locking plate of a type compatible with the top attachment of the tripod.</p><h3>Can you hold a spotting scope?</h3><p>No. Even though spotting scopes are variable power, the minimum magnification level is generally above 10x which is far too high to hold steady without external support.</p><h3>How do spotting scopes attach to tripods?</h3><p>While it's generally possible to screw the spotting scope directly to the top attachment stud of a tripod, the preferred method is to use a quick-release locking plate. The plate consists of two parts, one which is permanently mounted to the tripod and the other to the base of the scope.</p><h3>Can you use binoculars as a spotting scope?</h3><p>No. Most binoculars have a smaller objective lens and considerably less magnification than a spotting scope and lack a reticle. The purpose of binoculars is to scan for potential targets, then use the spotting scope to zoom in on the target of interest.</p><h3>Are spotting scope mounts universal?</h3><p>No. You should check and make sure that the stud size and thread pitch between your spotting scope and tripod match. If you intend to purchase a quick-release locking plate, it should be of the type that is supported by your tripod's manufacturer.</p>"

kydex holsters,"<h2>FAQs on Kydex holsters</h2><h3>Is Kydex the best holster?</h3><p>Kydex holsters come out on top when it comes to retention and reholstering. Leather holsters take the crown when it comes to comfort and style.</p><h3>Do Kydex holsters scratch guns?</h3><p>Most modern firearms finish arent ""scratched"" by Kydex, but the plastic may leave a black residue on the finish that looks unsightly. The best solution to this is a little TLC and CLP. Pistols with mirror-polished finishes, gold plating, and so forth might be marred by drawing and re-holstering in any material, due to things like dirt and other debris getting caught inside the holster. If you're worried about scratching the finish on your handgun, it's probably not a carry piece.</p><h3>Which is better, leather or Kydex?</h3><p>Kydex by far is the superior option, offering a degree of retention, full trigger protection, and a perfect fit every time. Leather holsters don't retain your firearm without things like thumb break straps, and they don't protect the trigger from outside manipulation or from catching on the edge of the holster, especially as the leather softens. This can cause a negligent discharge, and injure or kill the carrier.</p><h3>How long does a Kydex holster last?</h3><p>Kydex holsters last for a while because the material doesn't soften or degrade like leather. However, parts of the holster like the screws can loosen, and some cheaper holsters can break or crack due to the hard plastic becoming brittle. Periodically inspect your holster for cracks, and if you see them, replace them.</p><h3>Is Kydex IWB comfortable?</h3><p>No less comfortable than other options. Carrying a pistol comfortably is more dependent on the type of pistol being carried, the carrier's body type, and whether or not they use things like a proper pistol belt. Things like wedges, claws, and sweat guards further enhance comfort and make your pistol something you can carry daily.</p>"

From there, a small dehumidifier can be installed to help prevent mold and rust.</p>"
rolling duffel bags,"<h2>FAQs on rolling duffels</h2><h3>What is a rolling duffel bag?</h3><p>That's why we love rolling duffels: bags that give you all the portability of a duffel bag with the option of rolling it across smoother surfaces.

Heavier boots, such as mountaineering boots tend to be stiffer.</p><h3>Why are hunting boots important?</h3><p>The purpose of hunting boots is to provide sturdy support for long days of standing and walking. With many hunters taking to the fields and woods during the winter, hunting boots are made to keep feet dry and warm.</p><h3>Are hunting boots important?</h3><p>On a hunt, nothing is more important than your feet. I've been on western deer hunts where guys and gals couldn't go anymore due to a nasty blister. Blisters are painful, and when they stay moist and continue to rub against the boot throughout the day, the pain can be excruciating.</p><h3>What's the difference between hunting boots and hiking boots?</h3><p>Hiking boots are lightweight footwear designed to withstand long treks over rough terrain.

shooting mats,"<h2>FAQs about shooting mats</h2><h3>What are shooting mats used for?</h3><p>Shooting mats allow hunters, recreational shooters, and military personnel to set up a shooting position in austere conditions where the ground may be wet, muddy, sandy, or covered in other undesirable material.</p><h3>In what environment will you mainly be using the shooting mat?</h3><p>Generally speaking, shooting mats are used either on hard surfaces at established shooting facilities (concrete pads, gravel, etc) or in the backcountry on bare ground, which may also be wet, muddy, or sandy. The shooting mat keeps the shooter and their gear dry, clean, and reasonably comfortable.</p><h3>Can I stake down the shooting mat?</h3><p>Yes, many shooting mats have either grommets or stake loops in the corners to secure the mat during windy conditions.</p><h3>Can I use a shooting mat in wet environments?</h3><p>Absolutely! In wet environments, a quality mat makes the shooting experience more comfortable and improves the ability of the shooter to focus on the fundamentals: sight picture, breathing control, and the surprise trigger break.</p><h3>What else can I use a shooting mat for?</h3><p>Shooting mats are handy for a multitude of uses. I keep one in my truck for when I have to repair or maintain my truck. A shooting mat can also double as a ground cloth for camping or even as a small picnic blanket for lunch by the stream. Padded shooting mats can even replace closed-cell foam or inflatable sleeping mattresses when camping.</p><h3>Why do you need to preload your bipod?</h3><p>Preloading a bipod is when the shooter ""leans in"" to the rifle, pressing forward with their entire body against the bipod to minimize the effect of the recoil impulse and the tendency for the rifle to jump off target after a shot. Done correctly, this allows the shooter to retain the sight picture during and after the shot and substantially reduces the time required for a follow-up shot if necessary. Some shooting mats include ridges or straps to secure the feet of the bipod so that they don't slip when the bipod is preloaded. This feature is a nice-to-have rather than a must-have as the bipod can be preloaded effectively by using rubberized or spiked bipod feet or placing a small weight (e.g., sandbag) in front of the bipod.</p>"
dry fire training systems,"<h2>FAQs on dry fire training systems</h2><h3>How do you train for a dry fire?</h3><p>Dry fire training is done in a variety of ways, but the most common method is to practice dry fires with an empty magazine. As you go through your dry fire training, you'll build up speed and accuracy as you become more comfortable with the drill.</p><h3>What are the benefits of dry fire training?</h3><p>Dry fire training is designed to increase your awareness of your surroundings, improve your control over your weapon, and help you avoid injury or death due to friendly fire. It's also a great way to break out of a boring classroom setting into the real world. You'll be able-ish at least once before you graduate from basic training, so don't skip it!</p><h3>Are dry fire training systems legal?</h3><p>Yes, if they're not being used to simulate live fire. Legally speaking, you can't use them to shoot at anything other than targets, though. If you want to take your dry fire training to the next level, consider investing in one of these laser dry fire training systems. They're expensive, but worth every penny if you plan to compete in IDPA matches or qualify for CCW permits in your state. I've seen them used effectively to train military special operations forces to engage targets without spooking nearby civilians, and they're also great for self-defense training.</p><h3>Is it difficult to learn how to use laser dry fire training systems?</h3><p>There can be a learning curve with some systems, namely setting up the software or zeroing the laser on laser dry fire training systems like the Mantis Blackbeard, but most of these systems include clear and concise information on how to set it up.</p><h3>What about recoil and loading a magazine?</h3><p>Using a system with force feedback like the CoolFire helps simulate recoil, and systems like the Blackbeard have their power stored in a magazine-shaped battery. The CoolFire doesn't impede magazine loading, so you can still practice magazine changes that way. For ultimate function, a system like a SIRT laser training pistol is best.</p><h3>Where should I place the target?</h3><p>Depending on your drill, place a target at a realistic engagement distance. The FBI minimum is 21 feet, but factors like being indoors vs outdoors, the size of the target, and the system you're using can affect that.</p><h3>How do laser dry fire training systems help with concealed carry licensing?</h3><p>Certain states have training requirements to qualify for a concealed carry license or permit, and while these tests are not overly onerous in terms of the requirements for accuracy, novice shooters may find a dry fire system helpful to familiarize themselves with their weapon before they go to qualify for their license. In addition, training both dry and live fire is essential to maintain an adequate level of proficiency to reliably ensure that you could defend yourself from an attacker.</p><h3>What kind of lasers do laser dry fire training systems use?</h3><p>Dry fire training systems almost exclusively use Class A lasers, either red, green, or infrared. This is for safety purposes, given that Class A lasers pose minimal risk to the human eye, and they don't consume much battery power or produce much heat. The different colors are personal preference mostly, but infrared lasers can help shooters not rely on the flash of a laser impact to aim their weapon while still allowing the camera on their phone to pick up the light for scoring purposes on an app.</p><h3>How many shots can be fired using the laser dry fire training system?</h3><p>It depends on the system.

Generally, holographic optics are also better suited for being used with magnification.</p><h3>Do holographic sights magnify?</h3><p>Both red dots and holographic sights can have magnifiers in front of them</p><h3>What is the difference between holographic and red dot?</h3><p>With a red dot, or reflex sight, you have a low-power LED that produces the reticle, while a holographic sight uses a more powerful laser that bounces around to produce the holographic image of the reticle. The biggest impact of this difference is the duration of the battery life for the sight.</p><h3>What is the benefit of a holographic sight?</h3><p>Significantly less parallax distortion. No matter where in the glass the dot appears, if you put the reticle on the target, you will hit the target. Faster in close-quarters scenarios. Works better with a magnifier than a red dot.</p><h3>What makes a holographic sight different from other types of optics?</h3><p>Holographic sights use a laser beam to illuminate an area in front of the optic that's large enough to allow the user to acquire their target and fire accurately without having to move their eye away from the sight. The laser illuminates a reticle on the lens that is magnified and superimposed over the real-world view, allowing the shooter to aim precisely without moving their eye away from the sight. The laser also reduces glare and improves contrast, making it easier to see what's happening far beyond the edge of your field of vision. Holographic sights also have tritium night sights, which glow green when activated by the laser and provide excellent illumination for low light conditions or no light at all. These are typically available at an extra cost. Finally, they're fully multi-coated lenses, so you get maximum light transmission and minimum glare and reflection. They're also scratch resistant and impact resistant, so they won't break if dropped or run into something hard.</p>"

In an absolute worst-case scenario, extreme corrosion could turn your barrel into a homemade hand grenade or a first-class rust bucket.</p>"
hatchets for camping,"<h2>FAQs about hatchets</h2><h3>What Is the best camping hatchet?</h3><p>Choosing the best camping hatchet is almost entirely dependent on the individual and its intended use. Some companies certainly have a stronger reputation than others, but choosing the single best camping hatchet for everyone is a nearly impossible task.</p><h3>How do you use a hatchet?</h3><p>Hatchets are designed to be used in a variety of ways, but the most common is chopping wood. You hold the axe head with your non-dominant hand and swing it down towards an object or log that's close enough to where the blade will make contact. The handle should feel comfortable in your hand and the axe head should fit snugly into the palm of your hand. If you have long fingers, you may want to get a shorter axe.</p><h3>What size hatchet should I get?</h3><p>The best size for you depends on what activities you plan on doing with it. For general tasks around the campsite, go with a seven- or eight-inch hatchet. For more serious tasks like splitting logs or building a fire pit, go with something longer, say 10 inches or so. If you plan on using it for heavy-duty tasks like felling trees, go with something even longer, like 12 inches or 14 inches. If you plan on taking it to the range often, go with something lighter, say six inches or seven inches.</p><h3>Are hatchets good for self-defense?</h3><p>Yes, especially if you're right-handed. A hatchet can deliver a painful blow to an attacker's face or body while minimizing the risk to yourself. Make sure you practice proper technique though, as there are many different schools of thought on how to effectively defend yourself with a hatchet, and they vary from school to school. That said, a hatchet won't likely stop a charging bear, but it could buy you time to run away or escape.</p><h3>Are hatchets and tomahawks the same thing?</h3><p>Hatchets and tomahawks are very similar, but tomahawks place more of an emphasis on throwing and lightweight design. Hatchets tend to be heavier and more focused on chopping wood than striking a target.</p><h3>How do I choose between a hatchet and an axe?</h3><p>This is a pretty easy choice that comes down to space. If you're able to keep an axe in your garage or vehicle, it will be much more efficient than a hatchet. If you're traveling by foot or tight on space, a hatchet provides quite a bit of cutting power in a more portable package.</p><h3>How do I sharpen a hatchet?</h3><p> We're sure everyone has a preferred method, but sharpening a hatchet is very similar to sharpening a knife. Depending on how beat up the edge is, you might need to use a file before busting out the whetstone.</p>"

If you plan to keep your firearm loaded at all times, springtime might be better because ammunition tends to go on sale during this time of year as well. If you plan to store your firearm unloaded, then the winter months may be better because ammunition tends to go on sale during the holidays and is often sold in bulk. Of course, if you live in an area prone to freezing temperatures, you'll want to make sure your safe has adequate insulation to protect against freezing.</p>"
gun safes,"<h2>FAQs about gun safes</h2><h3>What should I look for in a gun safe?</h3><p>A quality gun safe should use a minimum of 11 gauge steel in the body of the safe and preferably 10 to 7 gauge steel. Door construction is also very important. Look for a gun safe with at least 1/4 of solid plate steel or composite equivalent in the door. More secure gun safes have a 3/8 to 1/2"" steel plate in the door.</p><h3>What is the purpose of a gun safe?</h3><p>A gun safe is a safe designed for storing one or more firearms and/or ammunitions. Gun safes are primarily used to prevent access by unauthorized or unqualified persons (such as children), for burglary protection, and, in more capable safes, to protect the contents from damage by flood, fire, or other natural disasters.</p><h3>How secure are gun safes?</h3><p>A gun safe is not merely a case. It has advanced features such as biometrics, solid steel construction, and a secure locking system. These are unbreakable boxes of metal and thieves cannot steal anything inside them.</p><h3>How deep is a gun safe?</h3><p>A standard size safe is thirty inches wide, 60 inches in height, and 28 inches deep.</p><h3>How heavy is a gun safe?</h3><p>Entry-level gun safes typically weigh between 200-600 pounds. Mid-range safes weigh between 600 and 1,000 pounds. High-end weighs between 1,000 to 1,600. And commercial-grade safes can weigh anywhere from 2,000 up to 5,000 pounds.</p><h3>Do gun safes prevent theft?</h3><p>Secure gun storage can be a lifesaver. It can prevent theft and access by children, unauthorized users, and anyone who may pose a danger to themself or others. The best device for you is the one that is most appropriate for the circumstances in your household.</p><h3>What is a gun safe made of?</h3><p>Today, most gun safes are constructed from steel. The most commonly used is a steel alloy of iron and carbon. Iron is very strong on its own, but it lacks tensile strength.</p><h3>What's the most secure way to store my guns?</h3><p>If you want to keep your guns loaded and ready for action at all times, then a gun safe might be the perfect solution. Make sure you choose a lock that is rated by the manufacturer for resistance to drilling, cutting, and bumping. Also, make sure you get a lock that requires keys from outside the door to open it, not just a keypad inside the door. The latter is much easier to hack into than the former. Finally, make sure you get a lock that has a manual override option in case you forget your keys. This allows you to unlock the door from the inside without having to use a key from outside the door. It's a good idea to practice this before you need it, but it works well enough to count as self-defense training. You should also practice your escape route.</p>"

tactical wallets,"<h2>FAQs on tactical wallets</h2><h3>What is a tactical wallet?</h3><p>The word tactical derives from the Greek word taktikos, meaning organized or arranged. Later this term took on military and naval meanings, referring to the precise way in which these organizations accomplish tasks in the most efficient and functional mannar. Tactical also implies the use of precise hand movements. Tactical wallets bring all these definitions together: they are an evolved, more efficient and more strategically functional wallet, that uses precise hand movements to avoid wasting time.</p><p>Tactical wallets are generally made of tough materials to endure hard abuse and harsh environments outside. Some of the most durable materials are Italian leather, carbon fiber, and aerospace-grade aluminum. Make sure that the materials are constructed well to ensure a longer-lasting wallet.</p><h3>What advantages do tactical wallets have over standard wallets?</h3><p>The overarching advantage that tactical wallets have is some degree of elevated functionality. Some offer far more generous storage than their less specialized kin, while others sacrifice a bit of space for easier carrying of the bare essentials. Many feature toughened construction with metal frames, casings, and even integrated multitools.</p><h3>Are tactical wallets actually necessary?</h3><p>That depends on who you ask. It can be needless excess and a gimmicky flex to the average person. To those with active lifestyles who partake in strenuous trade jobs, extreme sports, the military, tactical wallets will give them added protection, durability, and weatherproofing for all their valuables.</p><h3>Are tactical wallets good for everyday carry?</h3><p>Absolutely!

chronograph watches,"<h2>FAQs on chronograph watches</h2><h3>What is a chronograph watch?</h3><p>A chronograph watch is essentially a wrist-mounted stopwatch that measures, at the very least, seconds. It will usually feature a start and stop pusher, as well as a reset pusher. More sophisticated chronographs will feature the ability to track split times, and some may feature specialized bezels to measure units over time.</p><h3>What is the difference between a chronograph and a chronometer?</h3><p>The question of chronograph vs. chronometer is the difference between the stopwatch complication that is a chronograph, and a watch being rated minus four to plus six seconds per day.</p><h3>Why do chronograph watches cost so much?</h3><p>Chronographs are more complicated and require more effort to make them reliable and accurate. Due to this, they always cost more than equivalent quality watches that are less complex.</p><h3>How long do chronograph watches last?</h3><p>A: Chronograph watches will burn through their spring power reserve or battery at a faster rate than their conventional watch counterparts, and experience more parts wear over time. Don't leave the chronograph running, and get your watch serviced every three to seven years.</p><h3>What is the purpose of chronograph watches?</h3><p>The Chronograph's main function is to allow a comparison of observation between a time base and, before the electronic stopwatch was invented, a permanent recording of the observer's findings. For example, one of the first applications of the chronograph was to record the time elapsed during horse races.</p><h3>What is the difference between a chronograph and an analog watch?</h3><p>A chronograph is a mechanical watch that measures elapsed time by counting the number of times a given event occurs within a given period, usually every second. The most common use for a chronograph is to measure how long someone runs before returning to the starting point. A good example of this would be the Marine Corps Marathon where you run 26 miles and have to complete the race in 2 hours or less.</p><p>How does a chronograph mechanism work?</p><p>The chronograph mechanism takes its energy from the mainspring in the going barrel and is driven by the gear train. With the integrated chronographs, the chronograph mechanism has a friction fit wheel onto the 4th wheel pivot which is driving the chronograph mechanism when it's active.</p><h3>How do I tell if a watch is real?</h3><p>The best way to tell if a watch is real is to check out the manufacturer's website and see what they say about their products. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. If they don't mention any limitations, then there are likely some hidden in the fine print somewhere. Make sure you read all the small print before buying. Also, make sure you get a warranty from the manufacturer if you buy one with a scratch or breakage. If you don't, then you could be held liable if anything happens to your watch. That said, these things can happen to any watch, so don't let it keep you from getting a decent used watch on sale. Just make sure you understand the limitations of the warranty before taking it off-island.</p>"
body armor,"<h2>FAQs on body armor</h2><h3>What is the difference between ballistic and non-ballistic body armor?</h3><p>Ballistic body armor uses hard plates or ceramic inserts to deflect or stop bullets, while non-ballistic body armor uses lighter materials like neoprene or polycarbonate for added protection. The downside of non-ballistic body armor is that it doesn't stop all bullets, so you may want to carry a firearm with you if you anticipate any threat of fire.</p><h3>How much protection do body armor vests offer?</h3><p>Body armor vests are rated by the American National Institute of Justice (NIJ) for stopping threats from handgun rounds, rifle rounds, and shotgun rounds. The NIJ gives each vest a rating of 4 stars for stopping handgun threats, 3 stars for stopping rifle threats, and 2 stars for stopping shotgun threats. The NIJ also rates each vest's ability to stop blunt force trauma, and those numbers are even lower, with only one star for stopping blunt force trauma from a handgun round, and no protection against blunt force trauma from rifle rounds or shotgun rounds. The NIJ does not rate the ability to stop shrapnel, which can be devastatingly painful but not necessarily life-threatening, so you should probably avoid wearing this type of body armor in places where there is a risk of shrapnel. Also, keep in mind that the NIJ tests their ratings against steel plates, so you might get more protection than the NIJ says you will. If you're interested in getting maximum protection, look at the military's armor system, aka MOLLE.</p><h3>What are the limitations of body armor?</h3><p>Body armor is not bulletproof. That comes as a surprise to much outside law enforcement and the military. Body armor is rated to stop certain types of ballistic projectiles ranging from low-velocity handgun rounds up the ballistic scale to high-velocity, armor-piercing rifle rounds.</p><h3>What is the strongest body armor material?</h3><p>Body armor is made from a special kind of Polyethylene called Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE). UHMWPE is the highest-rated thermoplastic in terms of durability and is about five times stronger than steel. It is an abrasion-resistant material that trumps other body armor materials.</p><h3>What is the purpose of body armor?</h3><p>Body Armor Vest. Also known as a bulletproof or ballistic vest, this is an item of body armor that helps absorb and reduce the impact on the torso from fragmentation from explosions and firearm-fired projectiles. This is usually worn by police officers, correctional officers, security guards, and some regular citizens.</p><h3>How is body armor tested?</h3><p>Researchers test body armor by mounting it on a block of clay and firing bullets at it. In movies and video games, body armor makes you invulnerable, able to survive many shots without even slowing down. In real life, of course, things are much different: Body armor doesn't repel bullets.</p>"
camping knives,"<h2>FAQs about camping knives</h2><h3>What is a camping knife?</h3><p>A camp knife is simply an all-purpose knife that's built bigger and heavier than a standard hunting knife. It should be unbreakable and should be able to double as a hatchet or a machete</p><h3>How sharp should a camping knife be?</h3><p>Sharp is sharp - either your knife is dull, or it's not.
