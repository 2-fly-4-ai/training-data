shooting mats,"<p>As nice as it appears to be to get down and dirty in the shrubbery, it's certainly not something most shooters want to do willfully. Shooting mats protect your knees and elbows from scratches and bruises by providing extra padding against the rocks, thorns, and sticks on the ground. And who wants to risk scuffing up their rifle by dragging it across the icy ground?</p><p>Unless you're a competitive marksman, shooting mats are unlikely to be on your list of must-have items.

They make certain that you receive relevant training in the comfort of your own home.</p>"
holographic sights,"<p>Holographic sights offer a unique way to see beyond your ability with lasers. By creating a reconstructed image rather than simply projecting a LED dot or crosshair onto a pane of glass, they ensure that your reticle remains visible even in the darkest of settings. This is done by illuminating a reticle image stored on holographic film within the window. As the light from the laser passes through the objective lens and hits the film, it creates a replica of the object. Since this image is created by illuminating a specific pattern on the film, different objects create different images. By creating a reconstructed image rather than simply projecting a LED dot or crosshair onto a pane of glass, they ensure that your reticle remains visible even in the darkest of settings.</p><p>While there are no technical limits to how many objects you can see at once, your ability to see clearly will diminish as the brightness of the surrounding environment increases.</p>"

biometric gun safes,"<p>To open, standard safes typically use a key or a combination entry system. A biometric, on the other hand, works by using your fingerprint.

(You should always still wear eye protection when using a bench grinder, though!)</p> <p>While bench grinders are straightforward power tools, DIYers and pros prefer certain models based on their ease of use, power, and speed (measured in rotations per minute, or RPM). These factors have been taken into consideration in selecting the following eight bench grinders as the best available for specific situations and users. Any of these bench grinders would be a good addition to your workshop.</p>"
soil moisture meter,"<p>Water is vital to thriving plant life—plants would shrivel up and die without it—but ensuring that you provide the right amount of H2O can be difficult. Those new to gardening may often over- and under-water their plants, but even experienced green thumbs can mess up occasionally. Soil moisture meters are simple garden tools that include sensing probes that detect the level of dampness in soil. They’re touted as the best predictors for watering, so to see if they live up to the hype, we tested the most popular ones available.</p> <p>To judge their ability to detect moisture differences, we tested numerous soil moisture meters in various growing mediums, including potting soil, dirt from the garden, peat moss, and compost. We tested them in bone-dry soil and then watered the medium to see how well the meters detected additional moisture.</p> <p>Checking moisture levels can also be beneficial by helping determine whether the soil is draining adequately or retaining too much water. After a rainstorm, for instance, if soil feels dry, it may be draining too much. A soil moisture meter can do away with some of the guesswork, giving gardeners a solid idea of true soil moisture conditions.</p> <p>Keep reading to learn more about selecting a soil moisture meter and find out the pros and cons of the following models, which all earned a spot in our roundup of the best soil moisture meters on the market.</p>"
sous vide machine,"<p>Sous vide, translated to English, means ‘under vacuum.’ This sounds complicated, but is actually a new and largely hands-off way of cooking meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, and more. The food is sealed inside a ziploc or vacuum-seal bag and immersed in a pot of water. The sous vide coil and pump are placed in the water and attached to the pot, then turned on, where they circulate the water using convection currents or a pump.</p> <p>The sous vide coil and pump heat the water to maintain a consistent and even temperature as the food cooks. This reduces the likelihood of hot and cold spots in the cooking water and reduces mess: when the food is finished cooking, remove it from the water, cut off the bag, and serve. The result is evenly cooked meat with a tender consistency, well-poached eggs, and vegetables that are tender-crisp with all of the nutrients still inside instead of rinsed away—sous vide is a healthy way to cook that doesn’t require constant attention.</p> <p>Sous vide machines vary across the market, with different temperature ranges and noise levels to consider. You may be interested in a machine with additional features such as a timer and wi-fi programming, so you can control the temperature and time with your smartphone. Keep your budget in mind, as well as the size that is best suited for your cooking tasks and available storage space.</p>"
keurig coffee maker,"<p>Keurig coffee makers—the original single-serve brewer—quickly became a household staple for many, and it’s easy to see why. The convenience of popping a pod of grounds into a machine and getting a fresh, piping hot cup of coffee a minute later is hard to beat.</p> <p>Since its initial release, the Keurig machine has evolved. You can get anything from a simple cup of drip coffee to something with a little more kick and pizzazz, like a latte or even a cappuccino. Some models even come with the option to make hot cider, hot chocolate, or a smooth cup of espresso.</p> <p>When it comes to features, the list goes on and on. For example, some Keurig models are designed so that you need to add water into the reservoir each time you make coffee, whereas others are built to brew dozens of cups with just one reservoir fill. As far as size goes, some Keurigs are tiny enough to fit in the kitchen area of an RV or camper, while others are large enough to serve an entire office. What’s more, many Keurig coffee makers are designed with a built-in touchscreen.</p> <p>There’s no doubt that Keurig will continue to tweak its machines to accommodate every individual taste, including yours! So grab a seat, pour a cup of joe, and read on to see the top suggestions for the best Keurig coffee makers on the market.</p>"
zero turn mowers for five acres,"<p>When caring for a large property, it pays to become familiar with zero-turn mowers. In the old days, a lawn tractor was the go-to machine for tasks like mowing the grass, plowing the driveway in winter, hauling firewood, and toting tools and supplies. Unfortunately, these tractors are not efficient when it comes to lawn care. Those who want to mow their acreage quickly and efficiently—and achieve a great-looking finish—are increasingly opting for zero-turn mowers.</p> <p>Unlike a lawn tractor, a zero-turn mower is a grass-cutting specialist. These machines are built to navigate the landscape with maximum maneuverability, which is made possible by independent wheel motors that let them turn on a dime. While a conventional lawn tractor may be capable of rounding a 16-inch-diameter circle, a zero-turn mower can trace a zero-diameter circle, or even pivot 180 degrees to retrace its previous path. Thanks to this extreme dexterity, a zero-turn mower can cut an acre of grass in half the time of a lawn tractor with the same size mower deck, saving operating time, fuel, and maintenance costs.</p> <p>If you need to mow 5 acres or more, there are several excellent zero-turn mowers that could be just right for your property. Ahead, learn more about the key specifications and features that we considered while compiling this list, and see why these models are some of the best zero- turn mowers for 5 acres.</p>"
grill thermometer,"<p>Depending on what you’re cooking, a grill thermometer can mean the difference between a perfect medium-rare steak and an overdone, chewy mess. Grill thermometers are available in a range of types that are used for various temperature readings, including the current temperature of the grill or smoker, the external temperature of your food or a hot plate, and the internal temperature of the food itself. Plus, some grill thermometers even connect via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to provide instant readings and alerts to your smart device.</p> <p>Due to this range of applications, the best grill thermometer for your next barbecue or tailgate party may actually be a combination of two or three different thermometers.</p> <p>As we did with meat thermometers, we tested these thermometers using both a grill and a smoker on a range of food, including meat, poultry, and fish. We experimented with cooking different cuts and types of meat, trying them on bone-in, boneless, ground beef, and poultry, as well as whole fish and fish fillets. Finally, we also tested them in all kinds of weather and light to gauge the responses of the thermometers in real-world conditions.</p> <p>Keep reading to learn more about the different features, considering the realities of how and where you most often use your grill and/or smoker, and take a look below to check out some of the best grill thermometers for your purposes.</p>"
mop for wood floors,"<p>Hardwood floors are a coveted classic for their diverse graining and beautiful colors that add richness and dimension to so many decor schemes. But in homes with children, pets, and/or heavy traffic, wood floors are prone to showing dirt and dust quickly. If maintained properly—and that means having the right tool—wood floors can hold their finish for years without damage or cracking. Some brooms, for instance, can be too abrasive, whereas mops designed to clean wood floors are ideal for these surfaces.</p> <p>It can be tricky to pick a mop that suits your cleaning style and budget, as well as the degree of dirt and stains on your flooring. To help you find the best mop for your situation, we put a host of different products through their paces in a home with plenty of dust, dirt, and pet hair. While some excellent products came from familiar, trusted brands, we were surprised to learn that a few top contenders failed to perform as expected. This goes to show the importance of real user testing to separate hype from quality. Read on to get a handle on what to look for in the best mops for wood floors, as well as our reviews of products we deem superior in today’s crowded market.</p> <p>ALSO TESTED:</p> <p>O-Cedar EasyWring Spin Mop &amp; Bucket<br/> PurSteam Steam Mop Cleaner<br/> O-Cedar ProMist MAX Microfiber Spray Mop</p>"
electric tiller,"<p>Healthy and loose soil is an unquestionable necessity in any garden. Unfortunately, transforming hard, compacted soil into the growing environment plants crave can require a lot of manual effort—especially if it’s a brand-new plot that’s never been graced by a gardener’s loving touch. That is, unless you use a rototiller.</p> <p>A rototiller uses a series of blades to loosen and aerate hard soil, allowing for proper drainage to maintain adequate moisture and keep plants hydrated. These garden tools also create a favorable environment for symbiotic organisms like beneficial bacteria and worms.</p> <p>Also known as a garden tiller or cultivator (though the latter term may convey a more light-duty device), these tools can be used to break up soil for a new garden bed or for shallow cultivation and weed prevention around growing plants. Powered tillers often serve for seasonal soil preparation, mixing in soil amendments like fertilizer and weed control.</p> <p>Considering the various sizes, features, and prices of these tools—as well as their quality and dependability—we opted to put a number of different popular products through their paces. We tested the following garden tillers to learn more about their ability to prepare and maintain garden beds. Read on to understand the criteria we used to select these products, and then check out our reviews to find how they performed and why we counted them among the best electric tillers.</p>"
rubber mallet,"<p>Rubber mallets are excellent additions to many toolboxes. They give you the ability to adequately address specific tasks, like banging out dents in metal, hammering wooden dowels, or nudging flooring tiles into place. Think of a rubber mallet as a padded hammer. Avoid using this type of hammer on metal nails because it will damage the mallet’s soft rubber head. A rubber mallet comes in handy when you need a little extra force, but you don’t want to damage ceramic flooring, tiles, or other fragile materials. When you shop, consider the size and weight of the mallet you plan to swing and choose one according to the task. If you aren’t certain how you will use this tool, find an average-sized mallet, around 16 ounces.</p> <p>The best rubber mallet for you will also have an appropriate head, grip, and handle material. The head of a rubber mallet can be made entirely of the same soft rubber, but it may have a soft rubber on one side and hard rubber on the other. Manufacturers typically make mallet handles from wood, steel, or fiberglass, with fiberglass having the edge on weight and vibration absorption. The type of grip it has is a personal choice. Some people prefer a smooth grip on their mallet, while others want a rubberized grip to absorb any residual impact force that reverberates through the handle.</p>"
portable air compressor,"<p>Pneumatic tools that run by a portable air compressor can be a huge help and time-saver on a range of projects and at the construction site. Nail guns, for instance, drive fasteners with the pull of a trigger rather than pounds of a hammer. Impact wrenches can apply tons of torque and twisting power in seconds. Filling a truck tire will go from a nearly impossible task to a cinch with a tire inflator. All of these tools use the pressure and volume created by an air compressor.</p> <p>A portable air compressor squeezes air into a metal tank, which it then releases through a hose in order to power a tool. Portable air compressors must be fairly lightweight and compact so one person can pick them up, wheel them around, or lift them into the bed of a truck with ease. To create a small footprint (typically between about 25 and 70 pounds), manufacturers keep tanks small and use lighter-duty motors. While this is great for portability, it often comes at the sacrifice of volume and serviceability.</p> <p>The best portable air compressors are small, handy machines that help make short work of a to-do list, improving accuracy, workflow, and efficiency. Read on to learn what to look for in a portable air compressor and why the following models are among the best in their respective categories.</p>"
anti fog safety glasses,"<p>Safety gear is required on job sites for a variety of professions, and DIYers are strongly advised to follow that lead when tackling projects. Depending on the task, this may mean hearing protection, knee pads, and—whether in a home workshop, at a construction site, or in a medical facility—anti-fog safety glasses. Working in a humid environment or simply exerting oneself is enough to fog up a pair of safety glasses, dangerously obscuring one’s vision. Anti-fog glasses have coatings and venting that prevent them from fogging up, ensuring the user can see clearly while operating a dangerous power tool or treating a patient. The best safety glasses also protect the user from projectiles, be that debris from a woodworking project or bodily fluid during a dental or medical procedure.</p> <p>Safety eyewear comes in a range of types, including standard clear safety glasses, those that fit over prescription eyeglasses, prescription lens versions, and even bifocals. These glasses are available in different tints and a variety of levels of protection from projectiles, which is so vital when it comes to using various power tools. All these options can make choosing the right pair a challenge. This guide will add clarity by examining the most important factors to consider when shopping for a pair of anti-fog safety glasses while also reviewing some of the top models on the market.</p>"
meat thermometers,"<p>Whether you plan on grilling steaks on a propane barbecue, smoking chicken wings in an egg-shaped kamado grill, or roasting a full turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving, a good meat thermometer will help you get the job done right.</p> <p>Cooking is both an art and a science, and even if you don’t consider yourself on par with a Michelin-star chef, you can be certain that your meals are safe to eat with the right kitchen and grilling tools. To ensure that the meat on your plate is fully cooked through, use the best meat thermometer for the meal at hand.</p> <p>To find the best meat thermometers for your cooking needs, we tested some of the most popular options on a variety of meats, poultry, whole fish, and fish fillets. The thermometers were tested on both bone-in and boneless as well as ground meat, pork loin, duck breast, chicken legs, and meatloaf using cooking methods that included oven-roasting, pan-frying, grilling, and smoking.</p> <p>We noted how each operated in a variety of lighting conditions, grilling before tailgating in full sun, in cloud cover, and after hours in complete darkness. Finally, we also cooked in all kinds of weather, because as much as we’d like to grill under optimal circumstances, storms do come along at inopportune times—like when you’ve just laid the burgers over the charcoal.</p>"
compost bin,"<p>Compost is like a multivitamin for your soil. Made of thoroughly decayed organic material used as a fertilizer, it encourages healthy plant growth, strong roots, and bountiful blooms and fruit. Creating compost is not just good for your garden, it’s also great for the planet. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, food scraps and yard waste make up more than 28 percent of what ends up in landfills. The DIY approach also beats buying bags of compost at a garden center, which can cost from $5 to $20 per bag, depending on the size.</p> <p>The secret to transforming everyday organic material into garden gold is a compost bin. You could always start an open compost pile in a corner of your yard, but it’s bound to become a smelly, unsightly invitation to insects and animal foragers. Enclosed compost bins offer a neat, easy solution that creates compost faster than traditional piles by regulating the temperature, moisture, oxygen, and bacteria in the organic materials to help them break down faster.</p> <p>To help you better assess all the compost bins out there, we tested some of the top-rated products for both indoors and out. We did a deep dive into features, specifications, and customer reviews to create a list of favorites. Keep reading to find the best compost bin for your kitchen or backyard.</p>"
shower chair,"<p>Shower chairs are an essential device for elderly or disabled people who require the assistance of a support chair to have a relaxing shower. They can also be used in larger showers as a place to sit while scrubbing your feet or shaving your legs, and some are able to hold your soap, shampoo, body wash, or other shower necessities.</p> <p>The best shower chair for you will address your needs in your bath and vanity area. Before buying, consider the weight restrictions of the chair so that you don’t end up with a seat that breaks when you try to use it. Shower chairs can come with arms or without arms, and they can be adjustable or fixed. If you want a little extra height on your chair, so it is more comfortable to stand up and sit down, then invest in an adjustable shower chair with arms.</p> <p>Big shower spaces can allow you to install a shower bench, which is essentially an extended shower chair, except that it often has a higher weight restriction and more sitting space, making it ideal for larger individuals. You will also want to note the material that the bench is made from so that you can select a durable, waterproof chair that will work well and last for a long time.</p>"
grout cleaner,"<p>Grout isn’t something we usually notice until it becomes grimy, dark, or dingy. However, with the right cleaner, it’s easy to restore grout—and the surrounding tile—to its original beauty. Following application, grout lines can become smoother, brighter, and cleaner. But with so many kinds available, choosing the right grout cleaner can be tough. In order to help make the decision easier, we tested several types of grout cleaners to see which ones worked best and actually stood up to the claims they made to deliver a sparkling-clean result.</p> <p>As a space filler between laid tile, cement-based grout is made of natural minerals mixed with water. Since it’s slightly porous, grout can become stained through improper care or accidental spills. Plus, dust, dirty water, and soap scum can coat it and even soak in over time (especially when it’s not properly sealed). This dirty, moist environment provides the perfect foothold for mold and mildew to take root.</p> <p>While it’s possible to make a homemade grout cleaner, there are products on the market that can save time and energy while renewing grout. Keep reading to find out the results of our hands-on testing of some of the best grout cleaner options on the market and learn about some key information to consider when selecting a grout cleaner for your home.</p>"
vegetable peeler,"<p>The vegetable peeler is a staple in the home kitchen. This simple but useful tool makes preparing veggies quick and easy. There are two main types of vegetable peelers: straight peelers and Y-shaped peelers. On a straight peeler, the blade is vertical and aligns with the handle. On a Y-peeler, the blade is perpendicular to the handle. There is no better choice between the two styles—what’s best depends entirely on your preference.</p> <p>Vegetable peelers come in a range of designs and materials. The most popular blade materials include stainless steel, carbon steel, and ceramic. Stainless steel is durable, less prone to rust, and is usually dishwasher-safe. Carbon steel can stay sharp for longer than stainless steel, but is more prone to rusting. Ceramic is lightweight, rust-resistant, and sharp, but it is more fragile and likely to chip.</p> <p>Peelers’ handles are typically made of plastic, wood, or stainless steel and sometimes have ergonomic rubber grips. A rubber grip can prevent the peeler from slipping and cutting you. When shopping for a vegetable peeler for your kitchen, one of the most important things to think about is whether the handle is comfortable to hold. You might also consider whether the peeler is made of dishwasher-safe materials, has extra safety features, and can be used on a variety of vegetables.</p>"
hydration pack,"<p>Outdoor pursuits like hiking, cycling, backpacking, and running continue to grow in popularity. One of the most important health and safety precautions for these and other physical activities is drinking plenty of water. But the old days where your only option was to lug around a canteen or water bottle are long gone. Throw-away plastic bottles are no good for the environment, and refillable bottles can be cumbersome to carry and access on the go. Enter the hydration pack.</p> <p>A hydration pack is a specially designed backpack providing easy access to water. Some have easy-access external water bottle pockets. Many are built with a soft-sided water bladder or reservoir inside. A straw attached to the bladder threads through the side of the pack to the top of the shoulder strap. Instead of stopping to rifle through the pack to get a drink, the wearer simply sips from the straw without breaking stride.</p> <p>A variety of pack designs allow shoppers to choose the best hydration pack for their needs. Some offer plenty of space to pack gear for a long hike. Others feature low-profile designs that contour closely to the body for a greater range of movement. If you want to spend more time moving with less downtime, one of these hydration packs may be right for you.</p>"
surge protectors,"<p>If you’ve spotted flickering lights, tripped circuits, or prolonged overheating of any of the electronic devices in your home, your home may have experienced a power surge. This is a sudden, brief jump in voltage (lasting as few as 3 nanoseconds) above the standard 120 volts that runs through the home. It might be caused by switching on a high-voltage electronic device, improper wiring, an overtaxed power grid, or even wind or rain, any of which can lead to equipment failure or electrical fire.</p> <p>Luckily, a set of surge protectors can save the day in a home office, entertainment center, or wherever big-ticket electronics live. Resembling power strips, these devices plug into a grounded wall outlet (a three-prong outlet) and offer a number of spots to plug in. But, unlike power strips, which don’t protect electronics from voltage spikes, surge protectors divert voltage above a certain threshold to the ground wire. Should the house experience a surge, these devices stave off damage to computers, printers, gaming systems, and other electrical appliances.</p> <p>The best surge protector is one that works as advertised during a real power surge. To narrow your options, keep reading for the ideal specs to look for in a surge protector and recommendations for some of the best surge protectors on the market.</p>"
pocket knife sharpener,"<p>Any professional chef will tell you that a sharp knife is a safe knife—and that goes for your trusty pocket knife as much as any kitchen utensil. Trying to muscle a dull knife through an object is how people get hurt. When you consider a pocket knife’s small grip size, overpowering a blade’s edge can lead to disastrous consequences. We tend to use pocket knives in challenging, relatively dynamic circumstances, like cutting rope, opening packages, or carving a clean tip on a stick for a marshmallow roast; these activities only become more difficult with a dull knife. The best pocket knife sharpeners will keep your blade honed and fresh, making short (and safe) work of a carving or cutting project. Plus, most are small enough to carry in your pocket along with your knife for convenience on the go, while others can easily stow away in a hiking pack.</p> <p>Pocket knives tend to be very personal to their carrier with some families handing them down from generation to generation, more like family heirlooms than tools. So when it comes to keeping a perfectly honed edge on a prized possession, only the best pocket knife sharpener will do. You’re sure to find yours among the eight sharpeners reviewed here, selected for quality, price, and customer satisfaction.</p>"
organic fertilizer,"<p>All plants need nourishment. In nature, plants cooperate with microorganisms like fungi and bacteria to scavenge nutrients from a variety of sources, including the organic and mineral content of the soil and gases in the atmosphere. Under cultivation, these systems are not as robust. Domestic plants, from lawn grass to houseplants, need a little help to grow their best. That’s where fertilizer comes in.</p> <p>Organic fertilizers stimulate and support the natural processes plants use to feed themselves. The fertilizer feeds soil-dwelling microorganisms that then deliver the nutrients to plants. Over time, they increase soil organic matter which leads to improved soil aeration and water-holding capacity and a better physical growing environment.</p> <p>The best organic fertilizer options have an optimal NPK ratio (percentage by volume of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) for the plants to thrive. They’re derived from natural ingredients like plant scraps, animal waste, and minerals. Some are liquids, and others are dry. High-quality fertilizer requires minimal processing, is easy to apply, with a consistent texture throughout.</p> <p>The best organic fertilizer makes edible or ornamental plants healthier, providing a balance of nutrients, quality ingredients, and an application method that suits the gardener. Below, learn tips on choosing the right kind for your plants, and to find out why the following fertilizers are top performers.</p>"
lawn fungicides,"<p>Even the best-tended lawn can develop a fungal problem, which can show up as visible brown patches, rusty-looking or yellow spots, rings of dead grass, and slimy areas. Fungi and their spores occur naturally outdoors and are found virtually everywhere, but they rarely wreak havoc with lawns unless they start reproducing rapidly. Certain situations, such as living in a humid region or experiencing a rainy season, can increase the risk of a fungal infestation in a lawn. Other potential causes include overfertilizing, overwatering, growing turfgrass that’s poorly suited to the area, or mowing the grass too short.</p> <p>Today’s best lawn fungicide options are made with biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms that kill parasitic fungi and/or their spores; for the most part, they will not affect weeds or desirable plants (though there are exceptions). Some products are formulated to stop an active fungal infestation, while others may be preventive to keep a healthy lawn looking great. Many fungicides also work to eradicate fungus on trees, shrubs, and ornamental plants, although, depending on the formulation, some may injure specific types of plants or trees. Ahead, learn about the different types of fungicides and find out why the following products are among the best antifungal options for keeping grass healthy and free from imperfections.</p>"
heated vest,"<p>When temperatures drop, working outdoors can become downright uncomfortable if you don’t have a way to stay warm. You need to move freely in some outdoor occupations, including construction, surveying, and landscaping, so piling on constricting clothing layers isn’t an option. That’s where heated vests come in. These typically lightweight garments, which fit easily over a shirt or under a jacket, feature battery-heated panels that help keep your core warm so you can continue to work.</p> <p>I’d heard a lot about heated vests in the past few years, but I wanted to know if they lived up to the hype. Are they cumbersome? Do they really keep your core warm enough to stave off a bitter chill? Will they survive snow, rain, or sleet? These and other questions were on my mind as I tested several of the top sellers available today. I put these vests through their paces, tested all of their functions, and noted how long they stayed warm on a single battery charge.</p> <p>The best heated vest for you depends on the outdoor temperature and how much additional heat you need to stay warm and comfortable. Ahead, learn what to look for in a heated vest, and find out how the following models fared in my extensive testing.</p>"
rv sewer hoses,"<p>RVing is a wonderful way to commune with the great outdoors without giving up many of the comforts of home, including hot showers and flushable toilets. As wonderful as those amenities are, they come with a price. One unlucky camper must take on the job of dumping all that wastewater at the campground dump station when the camping trip is over. While there is no RV sewer hose on the planet that can make this dirty job enjoyable, there are models that make it more tolerable.</p> <p>These quality RV sewer hoses come with high-quality fittings that make tight connections so the person doing the dumping doesn’t have to deal with nasty sewage spills or endure foul odors. They’re versatile, too. A good RV waste hose can extend up to 20 feet in length to bridge longer distances between the RV and sewer drain and then break down to less than 5 feet for easy storage.</p> <p>Since RV hoses come in various lengths and material types, choosing the right one can be a confusing process. This guide will plumb the depths of RV sewer hoses to identify the crucial factors one should consider when shopping for an RV drain hose while reviewing some of the top models on the market.</p>"
bed frames,"<p>A good night’s sleep is the foundation of a healthy life, and the foundation of a good night’s sleep is your bed frame. While consumers tend to give a lot of attention to their mattress choice, the platform on which it sits is often overlooked—yet that’s what holds the mattress in place and provides additional support. Typically made of wood or metal, the best bed frame can come in a variety of styles.</p> <p>The simplest bed frames support the mattress without fanfare. Typically metal, these basic models are simple in design, and generally allow some space underneath for storage. People with basic bed frames often add a bit of style with a bed skirt. However, since the bed can often serve as the focal point of a bedroom, some folks opt for a more stylish frame to make a visual impact. Canopy bed frames and upholstered headboards can add a romantic flair, while heavy, wooden sleigh bed frames offer richness and warmth. Simpler wooden or metal frames lend themselves well to minimalist or industrial designs, and daybeds work especially well in smaller spaces or multi-purpose rooms.</p> <p>These quality bed frames were selected to suit a host of styles, budgets, and bedroom configurations to help you make the right decision.</p>"
electric broom,"<p>Mess accumulates in the home every day. Someone’s shoes carry dirt into the house, children’s snacks fall on the floor, the cat tracks litter out of the box, and the list goes on. A traditional broom requires you to crouch and sweep the mess into a dustpan, kicking up dust particles and allergens. Since a full-size vacuum can be too big and bulky for quick cleaning, and a handheld vacuum may be too small and also requires a lot of bending over to suction up the dirt, we tested some of the best electric brooms in real-world applications to find out which performs the best in each type of scenario.</p> <p>The best electric broom is often lightweight and transportable, provides powerful suction, and offers effective filtration to keep dust particles from entering the air.

organic lawn fertilizer,"<p>Creating a lush, healthy lawn requires attention to key details like mowing, irrigation, and plant nutrition. Mowing is a simple matter of keeping the blade sharp and setting the proper height. Similarly, irrigation is pretty straightforward once you understand the basics of deep, infrequent watering. Plant nutrition, on the other hand, can get a bit complicated. Although the basics of what makes grass grow are common from yard to yard, factors like soil acidity, grass type, and time of year necessitate a more nuanced approach to fertilizers. That’s why there are so many fertilizer options out there.</p> <p>Choosing the best organic lawn fertilizer requires a bit of understanding of the lawn’s current condition. Is it generally healthy and simply needs regular feeding? Or does it display a nutrient deficiency of some kind? After an application of fertilizer, is the lawn still a pale shade of green? Before buying and applying fertilizer, it’s highly recommended to perform a soil test to determine the soil pH and nutrient content. Use these test results to inform your fertilizer purchase.</p> <p>With that in mind, continue reading to discover the factors to consider when choosing one of these products and explore reviews of some of the best organic lawn fertilizers for healthy lawns.</p>"
beach chairs,"<p>Ah, the beach, where you can sit on the sand and chill to the sound of the waves. But don’t settle for laying on a towel. Up your comfort factor with a beach chair so you skip the sandy grit, soggy towel, and backache. The best beach chairs are similar to a camping chair, but designed with sand and water in mind. They’re lightweight and portable, and should also be comfortable and stable, sitting low to the ground so you can stretch out and relax.

recliners for back pain,"<p>With a proper fit for your body type, a recliner can be an excellent solution for relieving back pain and improving your overall comfort. When you lie back in a recliner and elevate your feet higher than your heart, it places you in a position of zero gravity. When a body is in this position, it relaxes and releases tension from the back, neck, and other muscles, which can offer significant pain relief. Another benefit of this zero-gravity position is that it improves the body’s circulation and allows blood to make its way back to your heart more quickly. This can encourage faster healing if you’re suffering from a back injury. Some recliners also offer heat or massage rollers that may provide even further pain relief.</p> <p>While there are many reasons to consider purchasing a recliner to help alleviate your back pain, a plethora of options on the market can make it challenging to decide on the optimal choice for your body and your specific back pain needs. This guide will explore several of the considerations to keep in mind while shopping for a recliner. Read reviews of some of the best recliners for back pain to help find the comfort and relief you’ve been seeking.</p>"
edc knife,"<p>It’s rare for a farmer, DIYer, or camper to go without a small knife. A knife is essential for performing many everyday tasks, such as cutting the twine on hay bales or taking a snip from a favorite vine. The best EDC (everyday carry) knife is relatively small and lightweight, so it’s easy to slip into a pocket or purse and ready whenever you need it.</p> <p>The most common type of EDC knife is a folding knife, often called a pocket knife, that features a 2.5- to 5-inch blade paired with a 3- to 5-inch handle. Non-folding knives can also qualify as EDC knives, but they usually include a sheath that attaches to a belt or a boot.</p> <p>When shopping for an everyday carry knife, look for quality over a fancy design. The best EDC knife will have a razor-sharp, durable blade, often made from carbon steel or stainless steel and combined with a hardener, such as vanadium. A good locking mechanism is also important because it keeps the blade from folding onto your fingers while busy whittling a work of art. You’ll need to maintain it with a knife sharpener every now and then, but the blade will stay sharp for long periods of time.</p>"
telescoping ladder,"<p>If you find yourself tired of lugging heavy, traditional ladders around, you may want to look into the best telescoping ladders. Made from aluminum, they extend up to 10 feet or more and then retract to a size small enough to carry under one arm.

vinyl plank flooring,"<p>Hardwood planks have long been a popular flooring choice, offering unrivaled natural warmth. Unfortunately, hardwood floors can also be expensive, difficult to install, and prone to dents, scratches, or water damage. Fortunately, there are alternatives that offer the look of hardwood, but with added durability benefits and a lower price point.

saucepan,"<p>Saucepans are incredibly versatile tools in the kitchen, though their value often goes under the radar. Though you may not recognize this type of pan by its name, you likely already have one in your cupboard. Saucepans are typically circular and made of metal, with taller sides compared to regular pans, more closely resembling pots. As indicated by their name, saucepans are often used to cook sauces, though they have a range of other applications like boiling rice and vegetables, sauteing, making puddings, soups, and more.</p> <p>Good quality saucepans are durable, heat quickly and evenly, and cool rapidly. These pans are made of a number of different materials, the most common being durable stainless steel or aluminum for even heating, and ceramic models are also available. Many of these saucepans have firmly riveted handles for added stability and don’t transfer heat to the cook’s hands, as well as a lid for simmering and steaming. The best saucepan for your kitchen depends on your preferred material, the range of recipes you cook, and what quantities you plan on cooking with. If you tend to prepare larger meals with more complex recipes, you’ll likely want to invest in more than one saucepan in various sizes.</p>"
shoe organizer,"<p>Shoes are an essential part of a wardrobe and often become clutter near the entryway or at the bottom of a closet. In addition to those who solely own practical footwear, shoe lovers and sneakerheads are frequently on the hunt for the latest styles and colors to complete their collections or pair with favorite outfits. After a while, finding a place to store or display all those shoes can become a challenge.</p> <p>While some collectors display shoes in a way that rivals a work of art, many turn to closets to store shoes.

grill brush,"<p><div><noscript></noscript></div></p> <p>When the weather is great and the cookout is calling, the last thing you may want to worry about is whether your grill is clean enough to use. Stuck-on pieces of fat and clinging grease can ruin the taste of any food cooked on a dirty grill.

gardening gloves,"<p>Behind every beautiful, bountiful garden is a great deal of dirty work. Fortunately, a pair of rugged, reliable gloves makes yard tasks faster, safer, and more manageable.

Still others feature clawlike fingertips that allow the user to dig without the benefit of a hand trowel. Keep reading to learn what to look for when shopping for the best gardening gloves, and check out how each of the following pairs earned a spot in this lineup.</p>"
electric grill,"<p>Not everybody has a backyard or year-round temperate climate suited for a traditional grill. Electric grills allow you to achieve the same cooking results indoors, on a porch, or on a balcony where open flames are prohibited. Plus, they don’t produce the smoke and char proven to carry carcinogenic properties, which pose a health risk after prolonged periods. Some newer models use infrared heat, which tends to cook meat more consistently than fire.</p> <p>An electric grill’s heating element, located inside or just beneath the cooktop, is powered with a cord similar to any other kitchen appliance—just plug it into a wall outlet and cook away. When you’ve finished grilling, there’s no waiting for coals to cool down or dealing with gas canisters; you simply turn it off or unplug it.</p> <p>Cleanup is typically pretty simple, especially on models with removable plates that can be washed in the sink or dishwasher. Most exciting for “real” grill enthusiasts: Some models now better approximate the heat intensity of a traditional grill, and many say that food tastes better for it.</p> <p>This guide will help you understand more about this type of grill and how to choose the best electric grill for your needs.</p>"
folding table,"<p>The purchase of a folding table may be a spur-of-the-moment decision when you discover you need an extra surface for dinner guests, garage sales, or crafts. It provides a temporary (though possibly permanent) place to feed folks, store or display items, or provide a work surface for space for sewing, painting, and other DIY projects. Dozens of models are available in a range of sizes and prices, but until a folding table is set up, it’s impossible to tell whether it will be sturdy and strong enough for your purposes.

tools for kids,"<p>A basic understanding of how to use simple hand tools like a screwdriver, hammer, or wrench is invaluable. Many parents start educating their kids at a young age on the proper use of tools, safety concerning tool use, and even how best to organize and maintain their tools.</p> <p>The best tools for kids often come in a set that includes a tool bag, tool belt, or tool box to help them keep their tools organized and protected when not in use. These tools are typically smaller and lighter than standard tools, often with ergonomically designed grips to help your child hold the tool. However, don’t mistake their diminutive size for a lack of durability or power. These tools are usually made with quality steel that can withstand continuous use, so you won’t have to worry about them breaking.</p> <p>When choosing the best tools for kids, also consider the variety of tools that come in the set. Some sets include a varied assortment of tools for a wide variety of situations or projects, while others include only the most basic tools for beginners.

track saw,"<p>For ripping sheet goods or cutting long lengths of lumber to width, a track saw can often be easier to work with than its counterpart, the table saw. Track saws make fast, accurate, repeatable cuts on sheet goods like plywood, lumber, and medium-density fiberboard.</p> <p>Track saws are not a replacement for table saws; they’re a companion. While they have a bevel capacity of up to 47 degrees like a typical circular saw, they’re purpose-built for precise cuts in heavy hard-to-manage material and are mainly used for square cuts. Probably more precisely referred to as a plunge cut track saw, the saw plunges into the work to begin the cut.</p> <p>They can be quickly clamped in place and provide incredibly accurate cuts, even in dense materials.

To remedy the situation, start with a luxurious bath pillow.</p> <p>Some of the best bath pillows can offer a soft and cozy place to rest your head, neck, and shoulders.

wood cutting board,"<p>Wood cutting boards have long been popular for their durability and aesthetic, but there has been some debate about how sanitary they are. While it was believed for a time that plastic cutting boards were the safer option, many experts now argue that wood cutting boards are actually superior when it comes to avoiding cross-contamination.</p> <p>When using a plastic cutting board, grooves form that quickly become a breeding ground for bacteria. Because plastic cutting boards can be quickly sanitized by washing them at high temperatures using a dishwasher, however, they’re still the superior choice for processing raw meat, unless you plan to sanitize your wood cutting board after every use.</p> <p>Wood cutting boards, on the other hand, are a great choice for bread, vegetables, fruit, and cheese. They also double as attractive tableware when it comes to putting out a charcuterie board or cheese spread when entertaining.</p> <p>While choosing the best wood cutting board might seem like a simple decision, there are actually a number of considerations to weigh. This guide will explore several important features to look for as you shop and then offer choices by category for some of the top products on the market.</p>"
heat pump,"<p>When compared with traditional HVAC systems that use a furnace for heat and an air conditioner for cooling, a heat pump can offer significant energy savings that result in lower household bills. They also could be called a heat exchanger because that’s effectively how a heat pump conditions a space.</p> <p>Using a refrigerant and a compressor, the technology can extract heat from outside—even when it feels quite cool—and pump that warmth into your home. In summer, it can be switched over to provide effective air conditioning. Heat pumps also can help reduce humidity. Other models are specifically designed for household hot water or for pool heating. Dual fuel systems, combining an electric heat pump and gas furnace, also promise high energy efficiency but are highly complex and expensive.</p> <p>This in-depth guide details key features of heat pumps, including types, capacity, and efficiency ratings, and includes some of the best heat pump options for home use. We scoured the market to present this list of top picks based on customer satisfaction, product efficacy, and value. We did a deep dive into the specifications, features, and customer reviews to select these top-selling heat pumps in a variety of categories.</p>"
hvac coil cleaner,"<p>Your HVAC system helps keep you and your family warm in the winter and cool in the summer. For cooling, it uses two main components: The condenser coils, which typically reside outside the house in a large box-like metal structure, and evaporator coils, which are located within the HVAC system inside the house.</p> <p>Over time, your air conditioner unit’s evaporator and condenser coils will collect dirt, debris, and various deposits. All that dirt can reduce airflow and insulate the coils, inhibiting its ability to absorb heat. This, in turn, causes them to work harder and can also shorten their lifespan. Because your condenser coils are located outside your house, they are exposed to the elements for most of the year. Even if covered when not in use, these coils can still be susceptible to inclement weather.</p> <p>Inside your house, your evaporator coils are exposed to dust and debris every time your HVAC system switches on—and that can clog them, just like condenser coils. To avoid this problem, it’s a good idea to clean your HVAC coils annually. The best HVAC coil cleaner will help keep your air conditioning system running smoothly and efficiently for a long time.</p>"
mosquito yard spray,"<p>While you may want your yard to be a tranquil place for kids or pets to play while you prepare meals on the grill or enjoy a morning coffee, mosquitoes and other flying pests can quickly take over a yard, forcing you inside.</p> <p>Eliminating and preventing these pests can be accomplished with the best mosquito yard spray or fogger. Mosquito yard sprays are designed for concentrated pest extermination, while foggers apply a low volume pesticide or repellent over a larger area, allowing you to treat the entire yard.

A spray may be easier to use, but a fogger can be refilled as many times as necessary.</p> <p>This guide includes important factors to consider when deciding on mosquito pest control solutions. Below is a list of some of the top products that can help control mosquito infestations in and around a home.

whittling knife,"<p>Whittling is similar to wood carving in that they both form wood into a new, creative shape. However, wood carving uses chisels and gouges, and might rely on power tools to carve the wood, while whittlers perform their craft solely with a piece of wood and a knife.

Just pick up a relatively inexpensive whittling knife and a piece of wood and get started.</p> <p>A new whittling knife is always an exciting addition for new and experienced craftsmen alike. You get to try out the cut of a new blade and the grip of the handle. Ideally, the best whittling knife will sit comfortably in your hand and have a curve to the blade to enhance your whittling ability.

The products below are recommended to help you find the best whittling knife to enjoy your hobby.</p>"
stain remover,"<p>Stain removers and laundry detergent aren’t the same thing, although they work hand in hand. The best laundry detergents remove dirt and odors and the occasional light to moderate stain. Stain removers, on the other hand, pack a more concentrated punch and are typically applied directly to the problem area.</p> <p>Although most people can live with a light stain or two on the garments in their wardrobe, what happens when you get ketchup on your favorite white shirt? Running it through the wash alone won’t solve the issue, and dry-cleaning or replacing the shirt entirely are options that are often out of budget.

For that reason, you might want to have a couple of the best stain remover options at the ready for different types of material and dirty stain sources.</p> <p>All stain removers should tackle stubborn stains that detergent leaves behind.

coffee percolators,"<p>Long before drip coffee machines existed, percolators made bold-tasting brews with plenty of caffeine. They’ve made a comeback among coffee aficionados who like a robust, full-bodied brew. Coffee percolators work by forcing boiling water up through a tube and saturating coffee grounds within a filter basket. The high temperature draws more caffeine from the grounds and removes some of the impurities contained in them, resulting in a more pleasant and potent aroma.</p> <p>If you need caffeine to kick-start your day and enjoy an intensely flavored brew, there are many percolator options in today’s coffee-living world. Traditional stovetop percolators can be used on a range, on the grill, or over the fire on your next camping trip.

cutting board for meat,"<p>In general, the best cutting boards are the ones that work the most efficiently in your personal kitchen setup. However, when it comes to meat, poultry, and seafood preparation, it’s essential to also consider food safety and presentation when choosing the best cutting board for your needs.</p> <p>The Meat and Poultry Hotline (run by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service) explains that consumers can use wood or any nonporous surface for cutting raw meat and poultry. For optimal safety, though, it’s best to consider using a specific cutting board for produce and bread and a separate one for meat, poultry, and seafood. This separation will prevent bacteria on a cutting board used for uncooked meats from contaminating other ingredients, especially ones that will be consumed raw, like lettuce.</p> <p>Presentation can also be a significant factor when choosing the best cutting board; a fancy roast presented on a dingy cutting board will diminish the dinner party. With so many available sizes, sets, and materials from which to choose, how do you know the most significant criteria? In this guide are things to consider when selecting the best cutting boards for meat and poultry.</p>"
stud finders,"<p>If you’ve ever had to install shelving or hang a mirror, you’ve more than likely had to find out where the studs were located behind the drywall. That’s because attaching anything heavy to drywall itself could eventually lead to the item crashing to the floor. Drywall is not strong enough to hold considerable weight, so to hang hefty items, it’s best to drive nails or screws into the studs that run up and down behind the drywall. There are a few tricks for locating wall studs, but these methods are not foolproof. Generally, it’s quicker and more reliable to use a tool specially designed for the purpose—a stud finder.</p> <p>A wide variety of stud finders are on the market, and we decided to test a slew of them to help readers find one that suits their needs. I tested magnetic and electronic models in my quest to find the best stud finder options out there. Which one is right for you will depend on the type of projects you tackle.

pipe wrench,"<p>Standard wrenches are useful when tackling various jobs around the home and yard, but they’re less helpful for plumbing repairs, because water pipes have no flat edges for these wrenches to grip. Pipe wrenches have serrated jaws designed specifically for this task. They bite into a pipe’s metal surface to provide the secure hold needed. What’s more, their long handles provide the torque necessary to loosen stubborn fittings.</p> <p>Pipe wrenches are often used in pairs, and you can find at least a couple in every professional plumber’s tool kit.

portable carpet cleaner,"<p>Vacuums may work well for removing dust and debris from rugs and carpets, but they won’t be any help with spills or stains. Carpet cleaners, on the other hand, are designed to remove stains with hot water, a cleaning solution, and suction power. While upright carpet cleaners are best suited for deep cleaning an entire carpet or area rug, smaller and more portable carpet cleaners are excellent solutions for spot cleaning and stain removal.</p> <p>There may be many kinds on the market, but the best portable carpet cleaners tend to be easy to use. It’s typically as easy as filling the tank with hot tap water and cleaning solution, then spraying the mixture onto the affected area and scrubbing to lift the stain. The suction vacuum is then used to draw in the dirt and liquid to deposit it into a separate “dirty” tank.

quiet air compressors,"<p>If you think that air compressors are just tools for auto mechanics and house builders, think again. From inflating tires and balls to cleaning electronic devices, powering air tools, painting, and more, quiet air compressors can help make chores easier around the house.</p> <p>While all air compressors pressurize air by pumping it into a storage tank until the operator releases it for a wide variety of purposes, not all are designed for the same tasks. And because so many air tool applications exist, there are a wide variety of compressors with different ratings for air pressure, volume, flow rate, noise level, configuration, and more.</p> <p>When shopping for the best quiet compressor, it is important to think through the ways it could be used in order to know which model has the right combination of specifications.

caulk for shower or bathtub,"<p>While DIYers can obsess about caulking technique, the truth is that laying down the perfect bead will do little good if you don’t use the right caulk for the job. This viscous, waterproof paste is primarily used to seal joints where two surfaces meet (e.g., where the tub meets the wall) or to fill cracks (which commonly crop up in the shower floor) to keep out air, moisture, and dirt.</p> <p>To defend your shower or tub against these threats, the garden-variety latex caulk commonly used on drywall, window frames, and wooden doors simply won’t cut it.

wine coolers,"<p>For true wine aficionados, storing wine in the refrigerator next to the milk and OJ just isn’t going to cut it. The ideal temperature at which to properly store wine is about 55 degrees Fahrenheit; a fridge is simply too cold for long-term wine storage. If you’re someone who spends oodles on wine (particularly wine that you age for a few years before drinking it), it makes sense to invest in a wine cooler that will protect those prized bottles of Bordeaux, Champagne, and Burgundy.</p> <p>A wine cooler uses a compressor to cool the air to the ideal temperature to store and protect wine. These units range from small countertop models that can hold a dozen bottles to large stand-alone units that can store a collection of 50 bottles or more. Some models even integrate seamlessly with under-counter kitchen cabinets and sport attractive stainless-steel exteriors with glass doors, wood shelves, and LED lighting.</p> <p>If you need a home for your expanding wine collection, read on to learn about the features you should look for in one of these appliances—and why the models below top our list of best wine coolers.</p>"
induction range,"<p>For those looking to make a kitchen appliance upgrade, the cooking range is a great place to start.

palm sander,"<p>The finishing touches on a woodworking project can transform decent work into stunning craftsmanship. Using just the right sanding and finishing techniques can make all the difference. For this reason, some DIYers spend hours slowly sanding down wood projects by hand to achieve the perfect finish—a method that is time-consuming and tiring.</p> <p>Whether the type of sander needed is a sheet sander or a random orbit sander, investing in the right kind of palm sander for your woodworking needs can help save both arm fatigue and time. Just attach a sandpaper to the bottom of a palm sander and the foot of the sander will vibrate rapidly in tiny orbits to efficiently sand down wood to a consistent finish, doing most of the work for the DIYer. Sanding can also open up the grain on a piece of wood so it accepts a finish coat more evenly.</p> <p>Purchasing a high-quality palm sander is key to getting the woodworking results you want to achieve. We’ve researched and field-tested some of the most popular palm sanders on the market and narrowed the list to the following top-rated models in their individual categories.</p>"
ratcheting wrench set,"<p>You’ll find many kinds of wrenches and sockets in millions of garages across the country.

needle nose pliers,"<p>Needle-nose pliers have long, pointy jaws for reaching into narrow or tight spots, such as the backs of electrical outlet boxes or crevices in car engines. They can also help users get a grip on tiny objects at awkward angles. These spiked grasping tools are a go-to when faced with small jobs that require precision. But which models perform the best?

When we finished testing, we examined the tools to determine whether the jaws were still in alignment.</p> <p>Ahead, learn what to look for when shopping for the best needle-nose pliers, and find out how the following models earned a spot on our lineup.</p>"
electric wine opener,"<p>Opening a bottle of wine at dinner to share with friends or in the evening to unwind is enjoyable and relaxing—or at least it should be. However, it can quickly become frustrating. If you drive the corkscrew through the cork lid, it pushes cork pieces into the wine, which is less than appetizing. Or if you have to fight to pull the cork out of the bottle, you’re likely to send wine flying all over the room and possibly your guests.</p> <p>To help you enjoy wine, instead of fighting with it, consider using an electric wine opener, and let it open the bottle while you get the glasses. The best electric wine opener is designed to make it easier to open wine bottles, with some products even going so far as to have a single-button function that screws into the cork, pulls out the cork, and then releases it in one movement.</p> <p>This guide will wade into the factors to consider as you shop for this convenient and time-saving tool and then explore some of the top-rated products on the market for increasing the functionality of your home bar.</p>"
coolers,"<p>Coolers keep drinks and food chilled for enjoyment during beach trips, hikes, long drives, sports events, and other times you’re away from home. RV owners can also benefit from a trusty, travel-friendly ice box, as some of the best coolers can maintain ideal temperatures for up to a week if packed correctly.

kitchen rugs,"<p>Inevitable spills may make some folks shy away from putting a rug in the kitchen, but there are plenty of great reasons for using one in your busy cooking space between function, style, and comfort.</p> <p>The warmth and cushioning rugs provide can be quite soothing in a room where you spend a lot of time on your feet. A rug also provides protection if you accidentally drop a dish, as these items are likely to bounce rather than break if they fall on a softer surface.</p> <p>Aesthetically, the right rug can enliven kitchen decor, whether you want to add a bit of brightness to a neutral room or bring a sense of texture to otherwise flat surfaces. Yet no matter how pretty, a rug doesn’t belong in the kitchen if it can’t hold up to the daily abuse it’s bound to encounter.</p> <p>Naturally, kitchen rugs should not pose a safety hazard in such a high-traffic area, especially if there are little ones running around. Ahead, learn how to choose the best kitchen rug for your household and find out why the following are among the leading options available.</p>"
potting soil,"<p>Unlike soil amendments that mix into natural soil for gardening, potting soil is an all-in-one mixture for container plantings that contains everything potted plants need to thrive. It’s an essential ingredient for indoor and outdoor container gardening with two major roles: to store and release water and nutrients that plants use; and to provide a stable base for plants to structurally anchor themselves. As an anchoring system, the soil must have a porous structure that allows the roots to penetrate deeply. As a moisture reservoir, it balances water-holding capacity and drainage, so the roots remain damp but not soggy.</p> <p>Potting soil (also called “potting mix”) ingredients are similar among all types and brands, but not all potting soils are the same. Companies formulate specific ingredient proportions for different growing conditions and plant types. Additives like fertilizer make big differences in overall performance. All this variety among products can make shopping for quality potting soil a bit of a challenge. This guide can help: Ahead, find shopping criteria, tips to help growers choose the right-size bag, and reviews for some of the best potting soils for container gardening needs.</p>"
soil for monstera,"<p>Sometimes called the “Swiss cheese plant,” due to the holes in its leaves, Monstera deliciosa is a popular house plant that adds a lush, natural touch to any room. Native to South America, where it can vine and climb up to 30 feet in height, this tropical plant species is grown extensively as a houseplant in colder climates and trimmed to retain a more compact form. In southern growing zones 10 and 11, where the winter temps do not dip below freezing, a Monstera plant can be grown outdoors as a hardy perennial.</p> <p>With its thick, shiny leaves, this lush plant prefers a potting soil that mimics the natural soil found in tropical and subtropical regions. The best soil for a Monstera plant is one that offers optimal growing conditions for the plant’s roots to spread out and seek nutrients.</p> <p>Each of the top picks below was selected after an in-depth review of the market and thorough product vetting. Ahead, learn what type of soil is best suited to the Monstera plant and discover the available potting mixes that are ideal for this attractive plant, indoors and out.</p>"
impact sockets,"<p>If you’ve spent any length of time working on automobiles, you’ve likely come across the benefits an impact wrench offers over a handheld ratchet wrench for loosening lug nuts and stuck-on bolts. Greater torque and power translates into greater tightening and loosening force, allowing you to work on stubborn nuts and bolts with greater speed and reduced manual effort. However, trying to use a standard socket set that’s not designed to withstand these higher levels of torque can easily damage or destroy your precious sockets.</p> <p>That’s where impact sockets come in. They are made from either chrome-molybdenum or an impact-grade chrome vanadium instead of the less durable chrome vanadium that standard sockets are made with. Then, they’re “carbonized” to make them even more rugged, and it’s this process that gives them their characteristic black color. And their use isn’t limited to just impact wrenches; they can also be used in an impact driver with a socket adapter or in a handheld ratchet wrench—making them incredibly versatile. Read on to learn about the characteristics of the best impact sockets, and discover some of the highest-rated products on the market.</p>"
dual monitor stand,"<p>Computer monitors have come a long way toward being more space saving and less cumbersome. Unlike early monitors that weighed dozens of pounds and took up nearly an entire desk, today’s flat-screen monitors are relatively lightweight. Computers can host two or more monitors with dual monitor stands, allowing each screen to be used for a different purpose. A home office’s primary monitor might be dedicated to spreadsheets or data entry, while a second monitor can display online research or show closed-circuit security camera feeds.</p> <p>Whatever a worker’s needs, the ability to connect a second monitor means not having to switch back and forth between applications on a single monitor. Plus, dual monitor stands help position multiple monitors at an optimal height for viewing while keeping the desk space less cluttered and more organized.</p> <p>The best dual monitor stand varies depending on work habits, work space size, and monitor sizes. Keep reading to learn about some of the key features to consider when shopping for a dual monitor stand, and find out why the following stands are well suited to a variety of work tasks and home offices.</p>"
window squeegee,"<p>Windows seem to attract dirt, dust, and pollen. Before you know it, the view outside looks like a hazy mess. Immaculate windows can transform living spaces, but chances are you’re not excited when it’s time to clean them. Window squeegees can make the job easier. These cleaning tools help you scrub away spots and remove water for a streak-free shine.</p> <p>Squeegees come in various designs, from small handheld models for the shower to long-handled designs that reach the tops of tall windows. The best window squeegee creates a seal against the window to completely remove water or cleaning solution with each stroke. Models that scrub and squeegee offer two-in-one benefits, and are highly convenient if you’ve got a house full of windows to clean.</p> <p>The number and size of your windows will also factor into the squeegee’s head size—the larger the windows, the larger the head. You might also consider using the squeegee for purposes other than window cleaning, as they can be great tools for your car windows and cleaning the shower. In these cases, designs with smaller heads offer better maneuverability in tight spaces.</p>"
paint stripper,"<p>Paint prep is a necessary but sometimes tedious step. Some types of paint prep are easier than others. On a piece of furniture with only a few isolated peeling patches, you can simply scrape, sand, and prime before repainting. But if you’re tackling a project that has already been painted several times—and likely shows widespread chipping, cracking, or blistering—you’ll need to remove the existing finish entirely before pressing on with your project.</p> <p>You could do this manually with a hand sander and a whole lot of elbow grease (not an option with lead-based paint). Or you can use a paint stripper, which will take care of the task at hand in far less time and with far less effort on your part.</p> <p>Before you set out to purchase a paint stripper for your project, know that not all are suitable for all types of paint and surfaces, and some include harsh chemical ingredients that require you to take special safety precautions. Keep reading to learn about what paint strippers are made of and how to use them safely, as well as to see our top picks:</p>"
electric scissors,"<p>Electric scissors may be one of the lesser-known power tools, but for those who spend a lot of time crafting or sewing, they’re a necessity. Cutting through yards of fabric, thick cardboard, and thin metal sheeting can quickly lead to cramping and aching hands, especially for those who suffer from arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. Electric scissors make executing these cuts easier on the hands, not to mention faster. In short, replacing a pair of scissors with electric scissors to the crafter or sewing enthusiast is the equivalent of trading out a handsaw for a power saw to a carpenter.</p> <p>Electric scissors, like standard shears, consist of two blades that slide against each other to slice through various types of materials. Instead of using the manual power of a hand to create this action, they use a small motor powered by a lithium-ion battery. While most models of electric scissors look the same, they vary in performance. Ahead, learn about what factors one should consider when shopping for the best electric scissors and learn why the models below are some of the finest on the market.</p>"
insulated tumbler,"<p>An insulated tumbler lets you savor your beverages throughout the day, keeping the temperature right where you want it, whether you’re drinking hot coffee, iced tea, or anything in between. In addition to maintaining a consistent temperature, insulated tumblers prevent condensation and can reduce waste, since you’ll be less likely to discard a drink that’s just as warm or icy as the minute it was first poured.</p> <p>There are different types of insulated tumblers available: Plastic versions, which typically use air or foam between the vessel’s inner and outer walls, can maintain beverage temperature between 2 and 6 hours. Vacuum-insulated metal models, which rely on an airless gap between the inner and outer walls, are capable of maintaining a consistent beverage temperature for up to 16 hours.</p> <p>While an insulated tumbler might just become your favorite mug to use at home, thanks to a leak-proof lid and an easy-to-grab handleless design, these versatile containers make great travel mugs. So read on to find out what factors and features to look for and why the following models are considered among the best insulated tumblers you can buy.</p>"
bread boxes,"<p>While bread cannot be preserved indefinitely, a bread box is an effective method for extending shelf life and quality. Placing baked goods from the oven or bread maker in the fridge is a common mistake: counter to popular belief, lower temperatures actually make them go stale faster. Storing bread in a plastic bag or food storage container doesn’t provide air circulation, which can contribute to mold growth in humid climates.</p> <p>Many bread keepers are designed with special air vents for optimal humidity and moisture levels. These vents allow enough air to circulate to keep your bread soft, fresh, and free of mold. Bread boxes are particularly helpful when it comes to all-natural products; without preservatives, baked goods go stale faster than their modified counterparts.</p> <p>In a dry environment, an attractive bread box without vents can lock in moisture, provide easy countertop access, and keep unsightly loaves hidden. Bread boxes can be both functional and stylish, with a variety of designs available to complement kitchen decor.</p> <p>The guide below includes essential shopping considerations and well-designed products to help you select the best bread box for your home.</p>"
insect repellent,"<p>From swatting mosquitoes around the campfire to batting away blackflies on the lake, insects can really put a damper on outdoor time. It can be difficult to fully enjoy a scenic hike or a backyard BBQ when the bugs are biting. Mosquitoes, ticks, mites, sandflies, blackflies, and other insects are more than just a nuisance: they can transmit potentially life-threatening viruses, bacteria, and parasites. A reliable bug repellent can reduce the risk of infection, and help you get the most out of your time spent outside.</p> <p>The best bug repellents are proven safe and effective—safe in that they pose an extremely low risk of side effects and no negative environmental impact, effective because they’re proven to reduce bug bites by a minimum of 50 percent when used as directed––or they can’t claim they are repellents. Insects don’t all respond to the same repellents, so it’s important to choose the right one. Repellents are available in different types and applications, as well. This guide breaks down these considerations and presents top recommendations for each category, to help you find the best insect repellent suited for your needs.</p>"
oil filter wrench,"<p>Henry Ford’s assembly line production method made personal ownership of automobiles a fact for millions of people. Along with car ownership came the joys of car maintenance, of course. Oil changes, a basic but critical component of car maintenance, require draining the vehicle of dirty oil, replacing the oil filter, and refilling the reservoir. Learning this fundamental maintenance process can result in thousands of dollars of savings in oil change costs over the life of a vehicle.</p> <p>Oil filters maximize motor oil life by cleansing it of tiny metal particles that cause engine wear and damage. Filters look like cylindrical metal canisters and are most often accessed through the hood or from beneath the vehicle. Oil filters are too large for removal with conventional tools—which is where the oil filter wrench comes in. These specialized tools are designed explicitly to remove oil filters. Filters come in a variety of sizes, types, and applications, so finding the right wrench can be tricky. This guide to the best oil filter wrenches will set you on the path to finding the best oil filter wrench for your oil change.</p>"
safety glasses,"<p>Many common DIY projects around the home, and in professional trades as well, require the use of safety glasses.

What’s more, not all brands on the market meet the safety and quality standards of those that made our list.</p> <p>There are a lot of different safety glasses available on the market, but not every product is effective at properly protecting your eyes, so we gathered several high-quality pairs and tested them in common situations where safety glasses would be necessary. Read on to learn more about what to look for in a pair of safety glasses and check out all the options that we rated as the best safety glasses in their class, including one that outperformed off of them.</p>"
pocket knife,"<p>A pocket knife is a small knife with a compact folding design that allows the blade to be stored in the handle when it is not in use. You may be familiar with the Swiss Army knife with its recognizable red housing, small size, and an assortment of implements in addition to the blade, but it actually qualifies as a multi-tool. A true pocket knife has a larger blade and handle, making it useful for whittling, opening packages, trimming branches, and many other cutting chores around the home, at work, or on a camping trip.</p> <p>While such versatility is valuable, some of the top pocket knives do have specific functions and features.

indoor garden,"<p>Indoor gardens are fun additions to virtually any space, and they’re especially well suited to those who love cooking with fresh herbs or enjoy colorful blossoms in the winter. Indoor gardens can be soil-based systems, but most are hydroponic, meaning the plant’s roots grow only in water. But how well do they perform in real-world conditions? To learn whether the claims made by the manufacturers of these growing systems are true, we put them to the test.</p> <p>We selected a variety of the most popular indoor gardens to see which ones were best suited for growing healthy plants.

benchtop planer,"<p>Benchtop planers—box-shaped power tools that reduce board thickness while smoothing the surface—top many a woodcrafter’s wish list. They fine-tune the wood used to create cabinets, bookshelves, and more, taking the place of old-fashioned hand planes because they’re much faster and easier to use. Just insert a board at the intake slot, and the benchtop planer’s internal rollers will pull it through the machine to shave off the surface quickly.</p> <p>However, benchtop planers can be pricey, so it’s essential to find one that will handle specific wood-planing needs.

locks for storage units,"<p>In just the past 5 years, more than 250 million square feet of self-storage space has been built in the U.S. Suffice it to say that more and more people are turning to self-storage to hold their belongings. And while storage units might be a great solution for reducing clutter in the home, they require a good lock to ensure those belongings stay secure.

induction cooktop,"<p>Induction cooktops are becoming increasingly popular because of the many advantages they offer. They transfer heat to your pots and pans through the use of a magnetic field, which means that while your cookware heats up, the cooking surface doesn’t.</p> <p>This technology allows you to boil a pot of water in just a couple of minutes, revolutionizing the speed at which you can undertake many kitchen tasks. Induction cooktops can also hold very low temperatures, which is great for simmering a stew for hours or ensuring a delicate sauce doesn’t burn. Because they don’t feature open flames and don’t stay hot, they’re also safer than other cooking methods. Additionally, they’re energy efficient, using 10 percent less energy than standard electric stovetops and half the energy of gas ranges.</p> <p>The only catch is that induction cooktops only work with cookware that contains the high percentage of iron needed to create a magnetic field. That means that while most of your stainless steel and cast-iron cookware is compatible with induction cooking, pots and pans made from copper, aluminum, and ceramic are not.</p>"
wine aerator,"<p>Exposing wine to air for a period of time helps bring out the full flavor of certain types of wine, particularly reds. Aeration allows some of the alcohol to evaporate, taking the bite out of the wine and enhancing the compounds that give the wine its flavor.</p> <p>While simply decanting can aerate wine, it can take up to 90 minutes for the wine to fully aerate, making it impractical for some occasions. The solution is a wine aerator that attaches to the opening of the bottle or to a decanter, allowing the wine to aerate in seconds. Wine aerators include simple designs that aerate wine by increasing its surface area as it is poured, and others that are electric models that add oxygen to the wine as it flows through a pressurized chamber.</p> <p>This guide describes important differences among the types of wine aerators and shares the features that are crucial to consider when shopping for the best wine aerator.

countertop water dispenser,"<p>Access to fresh drinking water is essential, but not all homes provide healthy water straight from the tap. Most municipalities do their best to ensure a water supply suitable for human consumption. But a broken water line, old pipes, or agricultural chemicals that leach into the water table can add harmful heavy metals and toxins to tap water. Relying solely on purified bottled water is pricey, so a more economical and convenient solution may be outfitting your kitchen with a water dispenser.</p> <p>Some water dispensers use purified water from a water-distribution center. This water, purchased separately, comes in tank-style containers that are typically refillable and may also be available in many grocery stores. Others draw water directly from the tap and filter it to remove impurities.</p> <p>The best dispensers will suit individual consumption needs, purification preferences, and personal style, as well as address the particular issues of the water itself. Ahead, learn what to look for when shopping for a countertop water dispenser, and find out why the following are all solid choices for providing clean, healthy drinking water.</p>"
cooling blanket,"<p>Fabrics that don’t breathe tend to trap heat and moisture against the skin, leading to overheating, waking, kicking off the covers, and then getting cold and pulling them back up.

flat top grill,"<p>Stepping outdoors to fire up the grill is one of the greatest pleasures that comes with warm weather, but the type of grill can greatly limit the type of food you can prepare outdoors. The slatted grates of standard grills make a great cook surface for dense meats such as steak, burgers, and chicken.

metal detector,"<p>Metal detectors are devices designed to find metal buried under dirt, sand, grass, and even in bodies of water. Metal detectors work by creating a magnetic field around the electrical search coil, which spreads out to an average depth of about 10 inches.

kids loft bed with desk,"<p>A loft bed is a great space-saving solution for small bedrooms because it has the same footprint of a standard bed while providing extra space underneath for working, studying, or doing art projects.

straight edge clamp,"<p>Making straight cuts with a circular saw, router, or jigsaw is a challenging task. While a cut with a few hitches in it may be just fine for rough carpentry, finish work demands greater precision. A straight edge clamp is a great solution.

Organization is challenging for children; using a toy organizer helps them learn how to put their things away starting at an early age, which is a tremendous help to you.</p> <p>Toy organization bins usually measure only a few feet high and have enough space for your child’s toys. A shorter organizer helps young ones see, retrieve, and put away their toys easily. Taller shelving can create a hazard if your little one tries to climb up to get a toy, which makes a dedicated toy organizer safer than repurposing an existing shelf.</p> <p>Proper toy storage prevents accidents and injuries, such as from stepping on a Lego brick. Look for a toy organizer that’s designed with safety in mind. Avoid organizers with heavy lids that can squish fingers. The best toy organizers are constructed with large pieces to avoid choking hazards and don’t use strings or straps, which are also dangerous for younger children.</p>"
circular saw,"<p><div><noscript></noscript></div></p> <p>The words “versatile” and “tool” are combined so often these days that it’s hard to tell if it’s the truth or just an easy marketing ploy. But a quick tour of a professional construction site will certainly prove that a circular saw—a handheld electric saw that uses a round spinning blade to cut materials—is the real deal when it comes to versatility.</p> <p>A good home workshop also warrants a reliable, powerful saw that can make short work of a variety of tasks, from breaking down a sheet of plywood to making quick, repetitive cuts on a stack of framing lumber. Circular saws, when set up correctly, can even cut grooves and dadoes.</p> <p>Almost every power tool company sells a circular saw, so choosing the right power tools for a workshop can be challenging. Whether you’re a DIYer seeking a lightweight battery-powered option or a pro in the market for the most reliable, feature-loaded model, this guide will help shoppers get a handle on what to look for among the best circular saw options.</p> <p><div><noscript></noscript></div></p>"
jointer planer combos,"<p>Buying rough lumber can save a lot of money and offers the opportunity to find and use interesting varieties. However, proper preparation is vital, or the finished result may be poor. Before anything else, one side needs to be flattened and is called the face. Another edge is machined at 90 degrees to the face side in order to have true surfaces as a starting point for accurate measurements.</p> <p>A jointer is the tool used to create a flat face and square up the edge. It can also bevel the edge if necessary. Once that is done, a planer (often called a thickness planer) can be used to make the second face parallel to the first and bring the wood down to the required thickness.</p> <p>Jointer planer combos are both of these machines in one tool. They are convenient and can be a space-saving alternative, but they’re sometimes misunderstood. Keep reading to find out the pros and cons, the key features, and some suggestions for the best jointer planer combo for a variety of needs.</p>"
glue gun,"<p>A versatile glue gun comes in handy for creating everything from kid-friendly crafts and decorative seasonal items to fabric-based interior design pieces, such as headboards, lampshades, and no-sew pillow covers. Around the house, a hot glue gun can also help plug nail holes, add traction to the back of rugs, and a host of other projects. While many types of glue require time (sometimes hours) to bond, a hot glue gun dispenses melted adhesive that bonds as it cools—usually in less than a minute—so crafts and DIY projects go more quickly.</p> <p>We tested the top glue guns on the market to help you pick the right one for your home repair and crafting needs.

Each of the top picks below was selected after an in-depth review of the market and thorough product vetting.</p>"
floor chair,"<p>Sitting on the floor quickly becomes uncomfortable without padding or support. Even sitting on a floor pillow or a thick blanket to play with a child or read a book outdoors on a sunny afternoon becomes taxing after a while, causing a backache or sore shoulders from hunching over. By offering back support and a comfortable cushion, a floor chair can help solve these issues while remaining flat on the ground (as it doesn’t have legs).</p> <p>The best floor chair is versatile; it can serve as an extra seat for guests, a meditation or reading chair, a spot to enjoy a backyard bonfire, or as a dorm room staple for all-night cram sessions. However, finding the ideal floor chair for your living space depends on what you have in mind for it. This guide will explore the important features to consider as you shop for this handy seating choice. Review some of the top-rated products on the market for a chair that makes the floor an option when you need a place to sit.</p>"
dust collector,"<p>Wood and metalworking projects can range from entertaining hobbies to necessary professions, like carpentry and auto mechanic work. However, the one thing they have in common is the mess that can be created by cutting, grinding, and sanding these materials. While the mess can be cleaned up after the project is complete, the dust can get everywhere, even obscuring the material while you work.</p> <p>The answer to the problem is a dust collector. These devices connect to the power tools in order to provide consistent suction, pulling in any dust and debris that is created while working on the project. The best dust collector for your workshop depends on the size of the space, the amount of dust that is typically produced, and whether a portable or fixed dust collector would be better. Take a look at the top products listed below to get a better idea of possible options, then keep reading to learn about important product factors that can help you choose the best saw dust collector to keep the workshop clean.</p>"
utility sinks,"<p>Many a DIYer has cleaned dirty paintbrushes in their kitchen sink. The bathroom sink might work fine for soaking stained clothes and the dog can get his bath in the tub, but while these are options to complete “dirty” tasks, doing so can stain, chip, or scratch nice plumbing fixtures. A better option is to install a utility sink in your garage or laundry room.</p> <p>A utility sink is also called a laundry, wash, or mud sink. It has a larger capacity than a bathroom or kitchen sink, so it can hold a small dog for a bath or soak stained clothes. A utility tub is also made of rugged thermoplastic or stainless steel that won’t stain lightly from paint or damage easily with heavy or sharp objects.</p> <p>Like kitchen sinks, utility sinks come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and styles, which can make choosing the right one a challenge. This guide will review what features to consider when shopping for one, while highlighting some of the best utility sinks on the market.</p>"
toilet plunger,"<p>Stuff happens—and so, alas, do stuffed-up toilets. Excessive amounts of toilet paper, waste, hygiene products, and even hair can flummox a smooth flush, and when a clog occurs, someone has to address it, pronto. That means using a plunger: a simple yet essential plumbing tool that creates suction to banish blockages from drains and pipes with forced air.</p> <p>There are different types of plungers, and a short-handled model made for the flat drains in a shower, tub, or sink won’t cut it in a commode. A toilet plunger features a pronounced flange (a short tube-like flap of rubber) on the bottom of its cup or bell. The flange fits snugly into the toilet drain to create a proper seal while also minimizing splashback. Once the flange is inserted, simply push and pull the handle to dislodge the clog.</p> <p>Though these plumbing pals are pretty basic, there are variations in design, materials, and price, so keep reading for key shopping info and to find out why the following recommendations rate as best in class.</p>"
watercolor paints,"<p>Whether you’re enrolling in your very first art class or selling your watercolor paintings in galleries, you know that investing in good-quality equipment and materials is essential to your success. The best watercolor paints provide vibrancy, intensity, transparency, permanence, and a plethora of color options for your favorite art projects.</p> <p>As you shop for watercolor paints, this guide may help you make the best choices. Depending on your preferred artistic style and creative habits, you may select dry cakes of watercolor paints in pans or sets of liquid watercolors in tubes. You’ll want to consider your budget as well. Less-expensive watercolor paints containing synthetic binders may be satisfactory for beginners and hobbyists, but if you’re a serious watercolorist, you may want to explore more expensive watercolor paints containing raw minerals.</p> <p>With a wealth of available options, it can be time-consuming and confusing to decide on the best watercolor paints for your needs. The following list of recommendations will meet the technical and aesthetic needs of watercolorists at every level, from beginners to professionals.</p>"
solar post cap lights,"<p>Even a small deck or yard can make warm weather much more enjoyable because you can move meals outside, sit under the sun with a morning coffee, or have friends and family over for a visit outdoors. With a few simple solar post cap lights, you can keep the fun going into the night. Illuminating a perimeter is made easy with solar lights since they don’t require a direct electrical connection or frequent battery changes.</p> <p>The best solar post cap lights are made of strong materials like ABS plastic, aluminum, and glass, ensuring that they continue shining even in poor weather conditions. These lights can also range in brightness from just 10 lumens, which is about as bright as a cell phone flashlight, to over 200 lumens. Keep in mind that this brightness rating only refers to a single light, so adding more to the deck or yard would increase the overall light. Take a look at the products below for help in finding the best solar post cap lights for your home.</p>"
greenhouse plastic,"<p>Abundant light is essential for healthy plant growth. While some greenhouse gardeners are fortunate enough to have greenhouse walls made from glass panels, the vast majority of greenhouses feature either rigid plastic panels or plastic sheeting. Compared to glass, plastic is inexpensive, lighter in weight, and, simply put, using plastic to build a greenhouse is easier. The greenhouse offers growers a chance to save money by raising seedlings to later transplant to the garden or provides a spot where tropical plants can survive cold seasons while still receiving ample light. The addition of self-watering planters, automatic drip systems, and automatic ventilation systems all increase a greenhouse’s ability to sustain plants.</p> <p>Choosing the best greenhouse plastic involves considering the local climate and determining the type and size of greenhouse that is best for the plants growing inside it. Ahead, learn about the different types of plastic available for covering greenhouses and why they are well suited for many greenhouse-covering projects. Then, read on to discover some of the top-rated options on the market today.</p>"
soil for aloe vera,"<p>The aloe vera plant, a member of the Aloe genus, is cultivated for use in many products, such as lotions and cosmetics. Thanks to its thick, spiky leaves, it also adds an attractive, natural decorative element that makes it a popular houseplant. Plus, it can be good to have on hand at home as a salve for an accidental burn: Simply snip a bit of the leaf and apply the clear gel to the injury to speed healing.</p> <p>Aloe vera, a perennial in warm climates, is fairly easy to grow indoors, though it does have one strict requirement: well-draining soil. Similar to other succulents, such as cacti, aloe vera doesn’t do well in growing mediums that hold water. The best soil for aloe vera often is sandy or contains small rocks that allow water to drain quickly out of the pot.</p> <p>Ahead, learn what ingredients to look for when shopping for the best medium for this attractive succulent, and find out why the following products provide the best soil for aloe vera plants.</p>"
compost tumbler,"<p>Composting has numerous benefits. In addition to recycling kitchen and garden waste into a helpful soil amendment for indoor and outdoor plants, composting helps keep significant amounts of organic waste out of the landfill. One of the cleanest and easiest ways to make compost at home is by using a compost tumbler.</p> <p>Composting uses aerobic, or oxygen-loving, microorganisms to quickly break down organic materials. Previously, home gardeners had to manually turn their compost piles with a garden fork to supply adequate oxygen, which often created a backyard mess that attracted animals.</p> <p>The best compost tumblers fully enclose the pile inside a vented barrel, eliminating the mess. They are mounted on a frame to make the barrel easier to turn, which eliminates the slow, back-breaking process of turning with a fork.</p> <p>If you’re interested in a faster and easier way to make high-quality compost, a compost tumbler might be right for you. Ahead, learn more about the criteria we used to recommend these compost tumblers, but first, have a look at these high-quality models.</p>"

marble sealers,"<p>There’s nothing like the look of a marble shower in a bathroom or a marble countertop in a kitchen—unless, of course, it’s marred by a dark stain. While marble and other natural stone continue to be among the most popular options for bathroom showers and kitchen countertops, their porous nature makes them susceptible to stains from spilled wine, coffee, soap dyes, and even cooking oil. The good news is there’s a relatively easy and cost-effective way to protect these surfaces.</p> <p>Marble sealers are easy to apply, and they create a protective barrier that prevents liquids from absorbing into the stone. Many of these products work not only on marble but also on granite, travertine, concrete, and even tile. With so many types of sealers on the market, it can be difficult to choose the one that will provide the optimal protection for your particular marble surface.</p> <p>This guide will examine several important factors to consider when shopping for the best marble sealers and then review some of the top products on the market.</p>"

electric fillet knife,"<p>Filleting fish is a process that involves carefully guiding the edge of a blade around the bone structure of fish to achieve a beautiful fillet. While hand knives are adequate for completing this job, fileting an entire catch of fish by hand can be time-consuming and tedious. Electric fillet knives speed up the filleting process dramatically, making them ideal for avid fishermen.</p> <p>Electric fillet knives function similarly to standard electric kitchen knives, with two blades inserted into a handle that houses a mechanism that rapidly moves the blades back and forth to create a sawing action to quickly cut through flesh. Corded models of these powerful knives can be powered by standard outlets, auto and boat cigarette lighters, and even 12-volt car batteries. Cordless models use rechargeable lithium-ion batteries to power their motors, making them ideal for filleting while on the boat or at the dock.</p> <p>This guide will explore the different types of electric fillet knives and the factors to consider when purchasing the best electric fillet knife for your needs.</p>"

leaf mulcher,"<p>Few sights are as lovely as the red and gold hues of falling leaves, but when you must rake them and bag them—often multiple times in a season—they can lose their appeal. However, if you don’t remove dried leaves from your yard, they can become a soggy mess that increases the risk of lawn disease. Shredding leaves in a leaf mulcher significantly reduces their bulk and, better still, creates organic mulch you can use around perennial plants.</p> <p>The best leaf mulcher for you will depend on how much leaf accumulation you get, the size of your yard, and how you prefer to collect the leaves. We tested a variety of leaf mulchers to learn how they perform overall and which ones offer the best value in different categories.

creosote remover,"<p>Creosote is a by-product of burning wood, coal, pellets, or oil, which create gases as they burn. These gases rise through the chimney, coating the inside of the chimney liner as they do. Today’s fireplaces are designed to allow maximum airflow, which reduces the problem of creosote buildup, but still, this design doesn’t completely eliminate the issue. It’s crucial to remove creosote before it becomes problematic and, even worse, dangerous.</p> <p>Having a chimney professionally cleaned is one method to remove creosote, but it isn’t the only way. Handy individuals can clean the chimney themselves if they have the right tools, and a variety of creosote-dissolving products are available to help. The best creosote remover for cleaning a chimney will vary based on the amount of buildup and the cleaning method necessary to remove the accumulation. Ahead, learn why creosote buildup can be detrimental, explore several of the factors to consider when purchasing creosote remover, and discover some of the best creosote removers on the market to keep your chimney clean and safe.</p>"
binders,"<p>Keeping the flow of bills, bank statements, and other miscellaneous documents from piling up on the desk is key to having a well-organized work space. Few things are more frustrating than hunting for an important financial statement or document that goes missing in action in the churn of documents.</p> <p>While a good filing cabinet helps, a quality binder is also vital to home office organization. The standard three-ring binder keeps hundreds of pages of documents secure and well organized for future reference. And with so many sizes available—from ½ inch to 4 inch—it’s easy to find a binder that’s just the right size. Binders come in hardback and softback, ranging in style from basic monochrome colors to sophisticated faux leather to artistic patterns and designs. Some binders even have features that make them easy to carry to and from work.</p> <p>In this guide, discover more about these classic organizers to find out what features to consider when shopping and which binders are some of the best for getting your home office organized.</p>"
air impact wrench,"<p>It’s difficult to imagine the immense torque (twisting force) an air impact wrench can apply, but here’s an example. A nut that is “hand tight” requires pressure of about 2 pounds per square foot, which is usually expressed as “2 ft.-lbs.” The best air impact wrench multiplies that energy more than 500 times. Tough jobs like loosening lug nuts, in which an extension bar on a standard wrench can prove insufficient, are a breeze for a good air impact wrench. You won’t find a pro auto shop without one, and they’re also used in engineering and construction.</p> <p>Air impact wrenches are neither complicated nor difficult to use, so there’s no reason amateur mechanics shouldn’t have one at home, especially if they already own an air compressor. Air impact wrenches also can drive lag bolts or perform any job that uses hexagonal fasteners.</p> <p>We compiled the following sections to help you understand the important features of these handy tools. This information can help you find the best air impact wrench for the job.</p>"
walk in tubs,"<p>Getting in and out of a standard bathtub can be dangerous if not impossible for those with mobility issues. Walk-in tubs, which have doors that swing open and low thresholds, are a safe and comfortable solution, allowing the bather to enter the tub without climbing over a 2-foot wall. Walk-ins feature depths of nearly 3 feet and an ergonomic bench, so the occupant can sit and soak up to the neck, rather than lie down as in a traditional tub. Some walk-in tubs also include spa functions, such as air jet and whirlpool jet massage functions.</p> <p>Though all walk-in tubs serve the same basic purpose, design details make some better suited to different situations—for example, those requiring wheelchair accessibility. There are also style, size, and budget factors to keep in mind when adding a walk-in tub to an existing bathroom or planning a room around one. This guide will examine the features to consider when shopping for the best walk-in tub while reviewing some of the top models on the market.</p>"
nutribullet,"<p>The NutriBullet hit the market in 2012 as a single-serve blender, and many consumers first came to appreciate them for making smoothies. But the device has evolved, and fans now rely on these kitchen magicians to whip up the ingredients for dips, soups, quiches, protein energy balls, and drinks.</p> <p>Most NutriBullet models are lighter, more compact, and more versatile than standard blenders. NutriBullet also works a bit differently from most other blenders; it uses very powerful blades that rotate at an impressive 10,000 rpm to liquefy food.</p> <p>Since NutriBullet first entered the personal blender market, a glut of imitators have joined the category. But some of these contenders have limited functionality and less-than-stellar operating histories. NutriBullet, meanwhile, has expanded the types and sizes of blenders it manufactures over the years to cater to a variety of different lifestyles. If you think this brand’s line might be for you, consider this list of some of the best NutriBullet options available—and read this guide for assistance in choosing the right one for you.</p>"
grill mats,"<p>Getting out into the fresh air with grill tongs in hand to prepare a great meal over an open flame is an experience many people enjoy, but the grill’s hot temperatures—and the tendency of smaller foods to fall into the fire—often limit which foods can be cooked on a grill. However, a grill mat solves this problem by providing a flat surface on which food can be prepared at up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit without sticking to or falling through the grill’s grates.</p> <p>Grill mats should be used to expand your grilling options, not to change your current grill routine altogether. Steaks can and should still be tossed onto grill grates and prepared over an open flame, but laying a grill mat next to the sizzling steaks will allow you to sauté some mushrooms, onions, and other veggies to round out the meal. The best grill mats listed below will allow home chefs to experiment with cooking their favorite foods in a new way: in the open air, on the grill.</p>"
concrete for any project,"<p>If you have any experience with home improvement, you need no convincing about the strengths of concrete as a building material. Sleek and attractive as granite or marble but a fraction of the cost, concrete is durable, economical, and DIY-friendly, perfect for constructing outdoor features, patios, and even furniture and decorative pieces. With concrete mixes from Quikrete—a company that has nearly 80 years in the business—building a breathtaking outdoor space is as simple as adding the right amount of water to the mix, pouring the prepared concrete, then letting it cure.</p> <p>Before you embark on the project of your choice, though, you’ll first need to select the right mix. Differences in concrete mix formulas make certain varieties better suited for certain projects. For example, special additives improve the flow of concrete for pouring countertops, while other additives boost the impact resistance of concrete for lawn borders. So, which bag of Quikrete should you bring home? Ahead, we break down exactly which concrete product you should buy for five popular outdoor DIYs, and why, so your concrete creations will stand the test of time.</p> <p> </p>"

riding lawn mowers for two acres,"<p>Lawn mowers have gone through numerous changes since the invention of manual push mowers, and larger, more powerful mowers that put less strain on the user have been introduced during that time. Riding mowers take things a step further than powered push mowers, allowing the user to sit on the mower and drive it around the yard. These oversize riding mowers are a bit much for small urban or suburban yards, but for those who have a 2-acre yard, it’s necessary to have a riding mower if the desire isn’t to spend hours behind a push mower in the hot summer sun.</p> <p>Investing in a riding mower with a broad deck can help maintain several acres quickly and effectively, or those who have a smaller yard may want to opt for a mower with a smaller deck and better maneuverability.

floor cleaner,"<p>Keeping hard floor surfaces looking their best is a matter of consistency. Whether it’s hardwood, laminate, vinyl, ceramic, stone, or tile, manufacturers recommend sweeping and vacuuming several times each week as the primary cleaning method. Doing so removes the dust and grit that can damage the finish and make the floor look unkempt. You can damp mop, using a barely wet microfiber mop, as needed to pick up lightweight particles that tend to scatter while sweeping. Occasionally, however, something stronger than water is necessary to bring back the sparkle and shine.</p> <p>Although steam mopping can help to cut through built-up dirt, and effectively kill germs, excess moisture and high heat can damage some finishes. A good solution might be to use a floor cleaner specially designed for your type of flooring. The best floor cleaners are pH balanced to protect finishes while cutting through built-up dirt, stains, scuff marks, and residue. Ahead, this guide identifies important shopping considerations and reviews some of the best floor cleaners on the market today.</p>"
mole trap,"<p>Your yard and garden should be a refuge from the hectic day-to-day grind—a place where you can sit back and relax, grill a few burgers or steaks, and just enjoy some conversation and relaxation. However, moles, voles, gophers, and other pests can tear up your garden and leave dirt tunnels and holes all over the yard, turning relaxation into frustration. These tunnels, holes, and mounds destroy the tranquil appearance of a yard or garden, but they can also be a severe tripping hazard that can cause twisted ankles, broken toes, and impact injuries from bad falls.</p> <p>The best mole trap is designed to be set up in the mole tunnels, ensuring the moles will travel directly to the trap and trigger the spring-loaded mechanism that either captures or kills them. This guide will explore a variety of top-rated products on the market featuring several types of mole traps. To ensure you have adequate information before deciding on a mole trap, read on to find important shopping tips and product considerations.</p>"

baking sheets,"<p>Baking sheets, cookie sheets, muffin pans, and pie plates can all be categorized under baking pans. However you choose to label your cookware, a baking sheet is essential for any modern kitchen. Baking sheets are ideal for roasting meats and vegetables. The wide surface area and efficient heating design even allow for an entire meal to be baked on a single sheet.<br/> Manufacturers offer a variety of features for baking sheets—like grip handles, nonstick coatings (and not all coatings are the same, either), and silicone pads, plus varying sizes and thicknesses.</p> <p>Different styles of baking sheets have their own specific strengths and weaknesses. For example, cookie sheets are specialized tools for certain types of baking but not optimal for other cooking tasks. How do you wade through the options and know what to purchase? In this guide, you’llfind a variety of considerations to keep in mind when searching for baking sheets to help you discover some of the best baking sheets on the market to add to your cookware collection.</p>"
weed killers for gravel,"<p>The standard practice when installing gravel paths is to put a weed barrier between the rock fragments and the soil to help reduce the risk of weed seeds sprouting and taking hold. It’s not foolproof, however, because dust and dirt can blow and settle in the gravel, providing an environment for weed seeds to grow. In addition, gravel driveways are sometimes installed without the benefit of a barrier, which makes them highly prone to weed development. Treating these areas with a quality weed killer may be the best solution.</p> <p>Pulling an errant dandelion here and there isn’t a big deal, but when multiple weeds appear, they can quickly multiply, making a path or a driveway look shabby and unkempt. Treating the weeds, which often entails treating the entire gravel or sand area, is usually the best way to eradicate the problem.

evaporative air cooler,"<p>Evaporative air coolers are a type of air conditioner that employs evaporation. A fan inside the machine pulls hot, dry air in through a wet media pad. The hot air quickly warms the top layer of moisture on the pad, causing the water to evaporate and dropping the temperature within the air cooler by up to 20 degrees. This cool, moist air is then expelled from the unit by the same fan that draws the hot, dry air in, creating a constant airflow through the wet pad and into the immediate area.</p> <p>These devices don’t consume as much energy as a traditional air conditioner because they only operate a fan. The water for the pad is provided by an internal tank that needs to be refilled when the level gets too low to properly cool the air.

glues for plastic,"<p>One formula definitely does not fit all when it comes to glues for your DIY projects. Adhesives are chemically designed to work with certain materials.

concrete cleaner,"<p>Some cleanup chores are tougher than others—and among the most challenging are oil stains on the driveway, paint spills on the garage floor, and mildew marking the foundation. That’s because most stains on concrete are created by tough materials like petroleum products, paint, and living organisms such as mold, mildew, and algae. What’s more, concrete is porous and tends to soak up these substances, so once they penetrate deep into the surface they’re especially difficult to dislodge. Choosing the right concrete cleaning method is key—as is using the right cleaner for the job.</p> <p>The best concrete cleaners, both liquid and dry applications, attack stains deep below the surface. However, the variety of materials that cause concrete stains requires matching the cleaner to the type of stain.

wasp traps,"<p>While wasps can be a helpful insect to have in the yard, eliminating grubs and other pests that can feast on your landscaping, they can also be a nuisance or hazard if they build nests in and around dwellings. While taking out any wasp nests is one option, a better strategy might be to prevent those nests from forming in the first place by employing the services of a good wasp trap.</p> <p>Wasp traps consist of bags or containers that contain bait that attracts wasps. A funnel-shaped opening on the container allows the wasps to crawl in but prevents them from leaving. Once trapped inside, the wasp either drowns or suffocates, depending on the type of trap.

pin nailers,"<p>There are certain situations in finish carpentry and woodworking where a big finish or brad nail just won’t do. These fasteners often act like wedges through thinner pieces of wood, causing them to split or crack. And when they don’t crack, they leave behind large holes that require going back with wood putty to fill them. The good news is there’s another option: the stealth, compact pin nailer.</p> <p>Pin nailers, also known as micro pinners, drive very thin fasteners that are actually just sturdy wires. The pins themselves come in stacks similar to those inserted into finish or brad nailers, but they don’t have a head, meaning a pin nailer can drive one without leaving a noticeable hole. Although they don’t offer a ton of holding strength, the best pin nailers can be a huge asset for trim, woodworking, and crafts.</p>"
random orbital sander,"<p>One of the first rules of woodworking is to sand in the direction of the wood grain to avoid creating cross-grain marks that compromise your home project’s finished look. But when a wood-grain pattern changes—for instance, on a parquet floor where grain direction varies from board to board—it’s difficult to sand without causing at least some blemishes.</p> <p>In these situations, one of the best (and quickest) solutions is to use a random orbital sander—a power tool that features a sanding pad that simultaneously spins and oscillates (orbits) in an ellipse pattern. That magic combination of spinning and oscillating dramatically reduces sanding marks.</p> <p>There are so many models on the market that choosing the best random orbital sander can feel overwhelming. But, there’s good news: We performed in-depth, hands-on testing with the following models to help point you in the right direction.</p>"

wood glue,"<p>With its unique grain patterns and natural tones, wood earns praise for being a beautiful building material. It’s also relatively easy to build with wood.

citrus fertilizer,"<p>Like other fruit trees, citrus trees thrive when they have the nutrients they need to develop healthy root systems, strong trunks, and branches.

fertilizer for potatoes,"<p>Growing potatoes is typically reserved for experienced gardeners because this tuber crop tends to be a bit finicky in terms of care requirements. Potatoes thrive in temperatures between 50 and 70-degrees Fahrenheit, require full sun, and need a loose, well-draining soil. Fertilizing is particularly important for potato crops, since they have somewhat high-maintenance nutrient needs.

But the gutters themselves are subject to all kinds of harsh weather conditions, which could cause them to leak.</p> <p>There are several effective approaches to fixing rain gutter leaks and plenty of different gutter sealants available. However, gutter styles and materials vary considerably. What works well on vinyl, for example, may not be as effective on galvanized steel, aluminum, or copper.</p> <p>Exterior caulks and roof sealants are often suggested as cost-effective solutions—and it can be tempting to use them if there’s some leftover from other jobs—but are they really the correct choice?

tool chests,"<p>Tool belts carry the essential items for a project while you’re working, and tool boxes transport more than just the essentials from home or the workshop to a worksite. But the grandfather of all these tool storage systems is the tool chest.</p> <p>A tool chest is the best way to store your full tool kit at home or wherever your workshop may be. These large storage systems offer far more space than tool boxes, in the form of multidrawer tool storage, but that usually makes them heavier and harder to transport.

dyson vacuum,"<p>Dyson vacuums have taken the cleaning world by storm since 1993.

drywall anchors,"<p>Drywall—comprised of compressed gypsum (a soft sulfite mineral)—creates wonderfully smooth walls. Yet insert a nail or screw into it and it’s likely to crumble, often resulting in the fastener working loose and the hung item falling to the floor. The solution is to use drywall anchors, which are designed to spread within or behind the drywall panel, creating pressure that locks the anchor in place.</p> <p>Rather than just picking up a random drywall anchor, users need to think carefully about the amount of support needed for the item intended to hang on the wall.

rescue knife,"<p>While driving home, some hotshot cuts you off, forcing you to slam on the brakes and flipping you off as he barrels past. Before you can finish your mental prediction, he clips another car, and they both go careening off the road. You and a couple of nearby motorists pull over and rush to the scene. As you exit your car, you grab your emergency kit and involuntarily slap your pocket, checking to make sure your rescue knife is ready and waiting in its proper place. While someone calls 911 and others approach the minivan, you head toward the speedster. His car has rolled a full 360 degrees, landing upright again, but effectively sealing him inside with a bloody scalp and a smoking engine bay in front of him. You know help is coming, but the kid needs help pronto. He is conscious, so you signal to him what you plan to do. You yank your rescue knife from your pocket, then shatter the window with its carbide tip. </p><p>It's a good thing you were ready.</p>"
hydration pack,"<p>If you've ever had to cover a serious amount of ground, you know two things: Thirst is real and water is heavy. A hydration pack can't eliminate the weight of water, but it can let you carry it in a more convenient way. The last thing you want when hiking a dusty trail is the boxy edge of your water bottle stabbing into your leg. A hydration pack is built to contour to the shape of its surroundings, avoiding issues with towing a bulky structure. Made to enhance your performance during strenuous activities, hydration packs incorporate a drinking system - a straw of sorts that lets you drink on the move. Sure, stopping to get your water might seem like it doesn't take much time, but if you're racing to a rendezvous point, every moment counts. </p><p>Because this tactical supply is so popular, there are a slew of options out there. To cut through the noise, we've pinned down the best hydration packs available, along with some advice on finding the right pick for your journey.</p>"
gun oils,"<p>You count on rifles, pistols, and shotguns to work when the time comes, and that means using the best gun oil. This seems to be the age-old question when it comes to firearms: which type of oil or brand to use. Sure, people bicker over which caliber is the best all arounder or the proper technique to fire from certain positions, but everyone who has cleaned a gun has asked themselves if the oil they are using is the best. When I was on active duty in the Marine Corps, it was a no brainer: We used the free generic cleaner, lubricant, and protectant issued to us. Since leaving the military, I've searched for the best so my guns are fully operational.</p><p>Picking the right gun oil boils down to intended use and desired performance. All-in-ones like the military-issued CLP sound appealing because of the convenience they offer. Are they as good as specialized oils or solvents, though? Let's break things down so you don't get stuck when you go to buy your next gun oil.</p>"
gun safes,"<p>Finding the right gun safe can be a big chore because there's so much variation in size, construction, locking mechanisms, and price. It can be hard to know what's worth paying for, what's unnecessary, and what's just crap.</p><p>No matter what segment you're shopping in, having an extra layer of protection for your firearms is a good idea. Parents need to be extremely careful about how they store guns in the house. Even if you don't have kids, it's a good idea to keep your guns out of the hands of house guests - invited or uninvited. Maybe that means stashing them in a hidden gun safe that you can access quickly. It could mean investing in a heavy-duty safe that can withstand crowbars and fire.<br/>We've been rounding up the best gun safes for every size, style, and budget and have landed on a few favorites. This gear guide cuts to the chase with our favorites. If you want to dive deeper into a specific category, check out some of our other gun safe gear guides.</p>"

Sure, an EDC backpack is perfect for day-to-day use, and waterproof backpacks are better suited for wilder excursions, but what can be better than a typical static backpack than one with wheels?

hunting blinds,"<p>If you hunt, you know that every opening day makes you feel like a kid on Christmas morning. With gear staged by the door and maybe a dog or two shaking with excitement, you hop out of bed for a splash of coffee and hit the road before the first signs of sunlight. Every game animal requires unique gear and strategy, but most of them come around easier if you have a good hunting blind. We don't care how disciplined you are; at some point, you're going to need to adjust your seating position or turn to check your surroundings.

fitness trackers,"<p>Even after just a few weeks without regular training, you might be shocked to see that your hard work appears for naught. When there's no early morning runs and drills taking you to the edge, it can be easy to rest on your laurels. Fitness isn't permanent - it takes continuous work. If you want to be able to pull off a run like George MacKay in 1917, or even just crush your next round of PT, you're going to have to keep up the cardio. But how can you tell if you're getting the job done? Instead of putting a finger to your pulse and timing out heartbeats, most modern trainers prefer fitness trackers. Measuring everything from distance to calories to heart rate, these watch-like devices take the mystery out of exercise. Of course, that relies on you finding the right fit for your workout style - something accurate, comfortable, and tough.</p><p>To help you track down the best fitness trackers around, we've compiled a list of the most reliable options. Let's take a look.</p>"

camping tents,"<p>The first time I hauled a camping tent into the wilderness on my own, I remember being a little irritated. Compared to my trusty Marine Corps poncho, tents are bulky and heavy. It also seemed like a weak move to bring such a structure into the woods.</p><p>I felt differently after the torrential rain hit. High in the Sierra Nevadas, the sky opened up with an onslaught of heavy rain that lasted most of the night. Even with running water flowing around and under my tent, the inside stayed nice and dry. That was a blessing because low temperatures would have spelled disaster for wet gear and forced me to make a forced hike more than 10 miles back to the trailhead.</p><p>I woke up the next morning not exactly rested, but with a newfound appreciation for a good tent. Maybe my poncho wasn't the best option, after all. Take a lesson from my precautionary tale and set yourself up with the best camping tent you can get your hands on from the beginning.</p>"

neck knives,"<p>A neck knife is a smaller fixed-blade knife that's carried by suspending the sheath from your neck with a cord or chain. Its widespread use is such that it's almost impossible to narrow down its exact origins, but cultures all over the world had their own variants, from indigenous peoples to the Vikings. They're frequently used for utilitarian purposes, though there are variants designed as last-ditch blades for self-defense, frequently in the form of a push-dagger or karambit.</p><p>Chances are you've seen a depiction of a mountain man, Native American, or hunter wearing a neck knife at some point, and I know I personally have worn several during my brief-yet-cringey tenure as a ""mall ninja."" They're a great option for people with limited pocket or belt real estate, such as rock climbers or kayakers. Whether you're looking for a blade for everyday carry, self-defense, adventuring, or just a backup, to your backup, to your backup, we're here with some of the best neck knives on the market that made the cut.</p>"
aviation watches,"<p>Sometimes a watch is more than just a watch, and the best aviation watches function not only as timekeeping devices but also as navigation aids. An aviation watch was once an essential piece of an aviator's kit during the golden age of flying, where a pilot, copilot, or navigator would have to manually calculate things like fuel expenditure, rate of climb, and conversion of statute miles to nautical miles. Other aviation watches of the era were simple ""Flieger"" watches, which have relatively large and simple dials and were intended for military aviators to keep accurate mission time and get munitions on target on time.</p><p>The world of aviation watches is vast and full of many similar-looking brands, and today's list aims to bring you the best no matter your needs or budget. Whether you want a new watch to match some recently acquired wings, or you love aviation history and want to own something to pay homage to manned flight, we've got you covered with the best aviation watches worth owning.</p>"
closet gun safes,"<p>Safes are a must-have for gun owners. A safe keeps firearms secure and protected from curious children and would-be thieves, and some even protect guns and other valuables from disasters such as house fires. That said, not everyone has the space for a 24-gun safe with a two-by-three-foot footprint, and weighs 750 pounds. Additionally, a large gun safe is visually loud and expressive as to its contents, which may lead to questions, and presents a large target.</p><p>Closet gun safes provide a more compact alternative, keeping firearms, documents, and valuables tucked away with your extra shoes and the odd spider. Smaller and lighter in weight, these are perfect for those in townhomes and apartments, as well as folks that just don't need a steel behemoth in their basement. When properly secured, you maintain the advantage and peace of mind that comes from knowing that your firearms are safely stowed and hidden at the back of the closet alongside your favorite hat and that sweater grandma got you last year for Christmas.</p>"
water purification tablets,"<p>What's faster? Light, lightning, or diarrhea? Answer: Diarrhea - because you run like lightning to the bathroom, turn on the light, and find the diarrhea beat you there. And while some people think it's funny while it's really brown and runny, getting a bad gut in the backcountry is no laughing matter. At best, it will make you miserable AF. At worst, you could die. So choosing water sources carefully is super important as is the method by which you purify your drinking water.</p><p>To save your ass from your own bad decisions, your trusty writers here have reviewed many of the commonly available water purification tablets (and droplets) for your water treatment use. We reviewed specs, read some science stuff about bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, checked a few government websites, drank copious amounts of coffee and later beer, asked the Magic 8 Ball a few questions, and then prepared to elucidate so the next time you play pull my finger in the woods, your butt won't let out a zinger.</p>"

foam rollers,"<p>If you're searching for the best foam rollers on the market, chances are you're already feeling the pain of working out, getting old, or just sitting in an office chair all day. Typically, a foam roller is not something you buy when everything is hunky-dory and you're feeling like a million bucks.

Making sure you purchase the right roller is an important part of the recovery and sustainment process.</p><p>Navigating the long list of foam roller options could be a daunting task, especially if you're unclear about what the differences could mean for you and your pesky injury.

ankle holsters,"<p>Self-defense is a human right, and while you may not be able to get away with slinging an M249 over your shoulder while you pick up your morning Starbucks, that doesn't mean you have to leave your rock chucker at home.

camo pants,"<p>Offering both functional and stylish advantages, camo pants remain popular for use in all sorts of situations well beyond their military origins.

dry bags,"<p>So, you've assembled a bunch of gear and a comfy pack to carry it all - but if you don't have dry bags to protect it from the elements, you're asking for trouble.

As a former Junior Officer in the Army, I've heard my fair share of jokes about getting lost - trust me, they're funny every time - and I know the importance of always being aware of my surroundings, but a good GPS can be applied to hunting in many more ways than just finding your way from point A to point B. Most GPS systems aren't specifically tailored to hunting, but the large majority can be easily used to meet any hunter's basic needs, including scouting, route planning, and tracking.</p><p>In this article, we'll narrow down the market choices to help you find the best GPS units for hunting, and go into more detail on how many hunters utilize their systems to maximize their hunting experience and increase their odds of coming home with a stock of fresh meat.</p>"
north face backpacks,"<p>Take a look around, and it seems like everyone has a North Face backpack. Everyone except you, that is. For some, trends pale in comparison to traditions, but let's face it: How many people do you know who actually like those not-so-sporty, generic packs? Sure, they get the job done decently enough, but when you live out of your pack, there's nothing like a quality backpack from The North Face to do the job well and with style.</p><p>Whether you're a traveling professional, a full-time student, or an avid hiker, you need a backpack that'll keep your gear safe and secure without breaking down after a few months of hard use. While The North Face originally created packs for outdoor enthusiasts, a massive number of its bags end on the backs of urban dwellers. Whether you need a pack for an afternoon on a local trail or a bag for your daily commute, we'll help you figure out which North Face backpack is best for you.</p>"
charcoal grills,"<p>If napalm in the morning is the best smell in the world, burgers on the grill must be a close second. It doesn't matter if the yard is covered in freshly cut grass or a foot of snow, sizzling meat over an open flame satisfies an almost primal hunger. We can debate the merits of grills that use charcoal, propane, or wood all day long, but they all make delicious food. One thing that's not disputed is how easy it is to grill up a masterpiece with good old-fashioned charcoal. This fuel source is inexpensive, efficient, and easy to use. Not having to guess how much propane is left in your tank is a nice bonus. So, once you've decided on a charcoal grill, which one is for you? There are several styles and brands to choose from, and we're here to help make sense of it all.</p><p>Imagine your ideal backyard cookout. The grill you're picturing is probably on this list. Let's go find it.</p>"
throwing knives,"<p>Nothing says ""operator"" like throwing knives at a target to blow off steam at the end of a rough day. OK, so a 19-year-old recruit fresh out of basic may not be anywhere close to being an operator, but even a newly-minted Space Force guardian can start sticking logs with a quality set of throwing knives, some instruction, and a little bit of patience. </p><p>Throwing knives is an age-old pastime with a history reaching back millennia. Unlike more recent military traditions such as slapping challenge coins onto a bar, warriors of all kinds have been launching knives through the air in combat, at backyard targets, and everywhere in between, further adding to the practice's honor and tradition. In fact, this has us wondering if maybe the Army Marksmanship Unit needs to start expanding its horizons.</p><p>To help you get started, we've rounded up some of the best throwing knives on the market. And remember: the enemy cannot push a button if you disable his hand.</p>"
survival knives,"<p>It can often prove difficult to nail down exactly what constitutes a survival knife. For some, a survival knife might simply mean a fixed blade that can withstand something more than pocket carry. For others, survival literally means holding onto one's life against the torments of the wilderness as they deliberately throw themselves into the wild with nothing but a knife and maybe the clothes on their back. Since it's impossible to state definitively that one knife will work for anyone, regardless of who they are, buying a survival knife means compiling a survey of the best ones, no matter your usage, budget, or size needs, and whittling the choices down from there. With any luck, the result will serve you well during your next outdoor adventure.</p><p>To that end, we've put together a list of the best survival knives that the gear reviewers here have managed to lay their hands on. Read on and find out which survival knife best fits your unique needs.</p>"
bushcraft knives,"<p>The phrase ""bushcraft"" is often dismissed by novices as just a fancy word for whittling sticks, a perception that makes even the best bushcraft knives seem overkill. The reality is that solid bushcraft skills can (and do) save lives in a wilderness survival setting. Whether it's crafting an expedient litter to carry an injured person to safety, building a shelter to keep warm and dry, or crafting a greenwood grill to cook food, bushcraft techniques are invaluable tools in the repertoire of any serious outdoors enthusiast. Specialized knives which prioritize coarse tasks like stripping branches, drilling holes, and splitting logs are essential for bushcraft tasks.</p><p>The best bushcraft knives will commonly have a Scandinavian grind and are ideally full-tang to achieve the durability required for arduous outdoor tasks. All of the options listed here were personally tested by our gear reviewers - and all of them passed their tests with flying colors. Here's what you need to know when looking for the best bushcraft knives.</p>"
spyderco edc,"<p>Spyderco knives have earned a solid reputation for quality and performance, and the way knife enthusiasts talk about them, you might be tempted to think they're the best thing since sliced bread. The company got its start during America's bicentennial year and settled in Golden, Colorado, the company's long-time hometown, two years later. After littering the country with its Tri-Angle Sharpmaker, Spydrceo introduced its first knife, the C01 Worker, in 1981 with the company's classic round thumb hole in the blade. Since then, the company has produced high-quality knives bof legendary fame. Their use of top-tier steel, smart engineering, and a variety of shapes and sizes make Spyderco EDC knives some of the best on the planet. </p><p>But are they the very best? We'll let you duke it out with the Benchmade and Kershaw fans out there. In the meantime, quit whining about the cheap hunk of junk you've carried around since middle school and slip a Spyderco EDC blade into your pocket instead.</p>"
camping canopy,"<p>Few experiences are as exhilarating and refreshing as camping - so long as you have the proper gear. Even if you are only planning a day trip, extreme weather can give you a run for your money. Whether it's the scorching sun burning your skin to a crisp or heavy wind and rain culling all your calories, the great outdoors is full of challenges. Thankfully, you can plan ahead by selecting a high-quality camping canopy to protect you and your campsite. Even if you have a solid tent, it might not hold up against hail or a sandstorm. The best camping canopies fortify your site, offer shade, and keep you cool on hot days. In a pinch, you can use them as a makeshift shelter or simply relax under their coverage. </p><p>Of course, these benefits are only there if you pick out the right canopy. To assist, we've tracked down the best camping canopies to help your campsite contend with the forces of nature.</p>"
running sunglasses,"<p>You can skimp on some gear, but when it comes to your eyes, you deserve the best protection. That's why we've compiled a list of the best running sunglasses. Whether you rock a pair of White Walker blues, beautiful browns, or hazel peepers, protecting them from damaging UV light is important. The American Optometric Association recommends your sunglasses block out 99 to 100 percent of UVA and UVB rays, screen out 75 to 90 percent of visible light, and that the frames fit close to your eyes and the contour of your head to protect from all angles. Those of you who participate in snow sports immediately understand this.</p><p>We used this general professionally-recommended criterion as the basis for our evaluation, and also took the cool factor into account - because we don't want you going around looking like complete dorks (paging Marine Corps officers). So buckle up and take a look at what we scrounged up as the best running sunglasses of the year.</p>"
survival books,"<p>It may not feel like it from atop our wealth of modern creature comforts, but human beings are survival machines. Our bodies are built to travel great distances and our minds are capable of incredible problem-solving. That natural ability isn't worth much if we don't learn how to use it, though, and there are all too many stories of people who weren't adequately prepared for an unexpected crisis. You're going to have to treat your mind as part of your survival kit if you want to give yourself a fighting chance.</p><p>One of the best ways to prepare for a survival situation is to invest in education. Even if you can't justify an in-person wilderness survival course, you can do an immense amount of learning with a few carefully chosen survival books. This kind of knowledge isn't one-size-fits-all, so we curated five books that will prepare you for a wide range of survival situations. It wouldn't be a bad idea to read all of them.</p>"

bushcraft axes,"<p>It's no secret that an axe is one handy tool, a must-have when you're chopping or splitting logs, creating an outdoor shelter, and even felling trees. If you're camping, hiking, or heading out into the woods for any reason at all, a bushcraft axe is just what you need. </p><p>Available in a wide array of different shapes and sizes, bushcraft axes can be slim and small enough to work like a hatchet or large enough to tackle serious jobs like cutting branches, splitting piles of wood, and more. No matter which kind you need, there are plenty of options to choose from. Suitable for creating firewood to clearing paths and trails, a bushcraft axe gives you a ton of versatility in one simple tool. It can do so much more than a small survival knife, too. </p><p>Wondering which bushcraft axes are worth investing in?

cell phone boosters for rural areas,"<p>Few things are more dangerous than being in the midst of an emergency and unable to make a call. Most heavily-populated areas have well-established cell phone networks, letting you call an ambulance or summon the police at a moment's notice if the situation requires it. Unfortunately, more rural areas have a long way to go in order to meet that standard. Dropped signals result in risky miscommunications and, when paired with the distance between rural settings and major services, the delay is something you just can't afford. Thankfully, cell phone boosters are built specifically to address this issue so you are never without a signal when you need one.</p><p>Of course, as with any new tech, it can be challenging to ID the best cell phone boosters for rural areas. Well, fret not, because here we break down the top selections for the best cell phone boosters for rural areas, along with some tips on getting the most out of the booster you pick.</p>"
spotting scopes,"<p>We've probably all been guilty of subscribing to the Super Troopers school of shot placement from time to time, but it's best not to admit that. Whether you're dialing your hunting rifle before opening day or scanning the horizon for trophy bucks, it's important to know what you're shooting at and exactly where your shot will land. That's where a spotting scope can help.</p><p>Spotting scopes offer far more magnification than binoculars or a rifle scope. They're mounted on tripods so you can get a clear view at tremendous distances. This isn't just helpful for long-range precision shooters, but it's also useful for anyone who wants to check their target at the local range without waiting to leave the bench during the next cease-fire.</p><p>We rounded up some of the best spotting scopes out there, spanning brands, features, and prices. We also broke down the basics of choosing a spotting scope, so you can put your money to work with something that meets your needs.</p>"
compact binoculars,"<p>When it comes to optics, a good pair of compact binoculars is a great way to up your game. They're more portable than long-distance binoculars, more usable at moderate distances than a spotting scope, and are much more publicly acceptable than a rifle-mounted optic.</p><p>A lot of attention gets paid to the EDC gear that makes up our everyday carry, but what you keep in your go-bag or vehicle is just as important. We're big fans of throwing a pair of binoculars in the car; the same pair of Bushnell binoculars has been riding shotgun in my trusty rusty for more than a decade. I've used them to spot wildlife, scout dirt bike trails, and keep an eye on roaming bird dogs.</p><p>This list is all about putting the power of magnified optics in your hands without weighing you down. We chased down the best compact options from the best brands to keep this list short, sweet, and packed to the gills with quality equipment.</p>"
dumbbell sets,"<p>Any bodybuilder or strength trainer knows that you can use dumbbells for serious gains. Real talk here: If you walk into a gym that doesn't have dumbbells you should ask for a refund and go find a real gym. As a lifter, it is important to have the versatility offered by dumbbells. Since they're available in almost any increment of weight, you can customize your workouts for progressive results. While adjustable dumbbells have seen a rise in popularity, there's something about an old-school dumbbell that can't be beaten.</p><p>Traditional dumbbells are a simple tool for strength training as they allow you to isolate muscle groups. The typical design has not changed in over a hundred years for this reason. But what makes a dumbbell good? Why spend a lot of money on steel or iron when you can get cheap molds for concrete? If you're asking these questions, then you should read on as we do the heavy lifting research on the best dumbbells.</p>"
hiking pants for men,"<p>Some of you may be surprised to learn that the best hiking pants for men are not heavy utility uniform trousers. After logging more miles than I care to remember in pants that felt like canvas lined with sandpaper, I'm thrilled to report that you don't have to endure such trauma on your own time.</p><p>Good hiking pants are light, strong, comfortable, and can keep you dry. They come in all kinds of styles so you can find the perfect pair for through hikes, day hikes, hunting trips, days at the range, or even the nine-to-five slog. Some of them are so good that we wouldn't blame you if they became your new go-to attire.</p><p>The problem is that there are a lot of manufacturers selling cut-rate pants that don't do what they're supposed to do (or fall apart way too soon). We sorted those out for you, so all you'll see on this list are the best of the best from our favorite brands.</p>"

free standing punching bags,"<p>Combat sports are on the rise across America, and so is the need for free-standing punching bags. Boxing, MMA, and traditional martial arts have captured imaginations far and wide, and the need to train is immense. Regrettably, gym and dojo memberships can be a bit rich for the blood, and for those who can afford it, training venues may get too crowded or may never stay open long enough for them to get in a productive training session. Either way, the ability to train at home can make all the difference.</p><p>Hanging and wall-mounted punching bags populate more than a few basements and garages, but for those who rent their space, move often, or simply need the ability to store their training gear out of the way, a free-standing punching bag can be a lifesaver.

trauma shears,"<p>As soon as you arrive on the scene, you're glad you remembered your trauma shears. It's your first call, and you just hope you're actually ready. Upon assessing the patient, you pull out your shears, and cut through the hem of his jeans.

As your partner takes over with some shears that actually work, you ask yourself, ""Who makes this kind of junk anyway?""

camping water filters,"<p>What's the most important thing to pack when you step off for a hike, camping trip, or field exercise? Famed collegiate football player and hydration expert Robert Boucher Jr. will tell you it's none other than high-quality H2O. Water might not always be the single most critical thing on your list, but it's certainly near the top, so you better have plenty. Notice we said to have plenty â€“ not to pack plenty â€“ because water is also very heavy. If you want a gallon a day, that's more than eight pounds you need to lug around, not to mention all those empty containers. You're much better off packing a hydration bladder or water bottle and a water filter to turn every stream and lake into your own water fountain.</p><p>Being able to purify water on the go isn't just a great way to reduce your pack's weight: it's a reliable, sustainable way to stay hydrated for as long as you need.</p>"

lpvo scopes,"<p>What's the deal with LPVOs? Why have they become the dominant optic in professional shooting circles, with firearm instructors, police, and elite military forces? I can tell you in one word: versatility.<br/><br/>LPVO stands for Low Powered Variable Optic, and they are a type of magnified optic that often starts at 1X and goes anywhere from 4X to 6X to 10X. At 1X, they can be almost as good as red dots sight; not quite as fast or as eye box-free, but pretty dang close.

These optics work well at dang near any range your average intermediate cartridge rifle can reach.</p><p>LPVOs currently rule as the dominant optic choice currently on the market.

Choosing the perfect blade can be a mind-boggling task, and if you have ever walked into a knife shop and experienced the paradox of choice, you are not alone.

minimalist wallets,"<p>Have you ever hopped in your car and felt like your seat was suddenly very lopsided? It's probably because your giant wallet has been smashing down one side for years, and the first time you get in wearing gym shorts you realize one side of you is sitting about an inch low. That's not the only problem. While your utilities might accommodate large wallets just fine, service and dress uniforms frankly look like trash with a big, fat rectangle protruding from your backside. The same goes for the jeans you wear on the weekend. Let's be honest with each other: none of us make so much money that our pocket cash needs to be visible from the outside of our pants.</p><p>A minimalist wallet can eliminate unnecessary material to leave your pockets more streamlined, comfortable, and fashionable. You'll still have room for your CAC (please don't call it a CAC card), driver's license, credit cards, and a little bit of cash.</p>"
shoulder holsters,"<p>We've all seen someone use a shoulder holster, but most of the time it's on TV. It's the preferred carry method of international spies, private investigators, and tough .44 magnum-toting cops. During my time in Afghanistan, shoulder holsters were also a badge of honor for SNCOs and officers with serious swagger. Most of the time, though, shoulder holsters get dismissed as a gimmick - and I'm not convinced that's fair.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons shoulder holsters aren't just for movie stars. They're very practical for anyone who needs to carry while spending a lot of time behind a desk or in a vehicle. They do a great job of concealing full-size handguns.

bedside gun safes,"<p>There it is, that dreaded bump in the night. Of course, your city requires all firearms to be locked up, and your safe is sitting a world away in the basement. With an intruder between you and your only means of self-defense, you suddenly regret passing up on that bedside gun safe you found on Black Friday last year. At the time, you thought it was gimmicky, and come on, man, you live in a good neighborhood. Who really needs a bedside gun safe in this part of town? Now, you're wishing you'd listened to your gut (and your wife) instead of splurging on that $4,000 Barrett safe queen. Not only would you have saved a few grand toward your kids' college funds, but your old Glock would be right where you need it now. Instead, you reach for your phone, punch in 9-1-1, and start looking around for your old softball bat. If only you'd bought that safe.</p>"
weightlifting shoes,"<p>The first time I ever saw someone wearing weightlifting shoes, I probably thought something along the lines of, ""aw, he got the velcro!"" That was quickly followed by acknowledgment that the dude knew something I didn't because he was warming up with my max.</p><p>Here's the thing: those funny-looking shoes you see people carrying around the gym aren't a thrift-shop special and they aren't for show. Weightlifting shoes are just as legitimate as belts and protein powder - and if you want to get strong, you've come to the right place.<br/><br/>We'll be the first to say that the road to Strongtown, USA starts with good form. It requires hard work, dedication, and humility. But the right gear can make a difference, too. If you've immersed yourself in the world of powerlifting, researched the Olympic greats, and memorized the words of Jim Wendler, Dave Tate, Stefi Cohen, and Oleksiy Torokhtiy, you're ready to invest in your fitness with the proper equipment.</p>"

gps watch,"<p>It's time to graduate from that basic watch on your wrist to something that can help you stay in shape, keep you connected, and improve your situational awareness. Think of GPS watches as a smartwatch that's built to excel in Teton Valley rather than Silicon Valley. This kind of watch is just as tough and utilitarian as your old sports watch, but with features you'd expect from the latest tech gadget. It's kind of like getting out of an Humvee and climbing into an MRAP: you don't have to give up any of the capabilities you're used to, and the list of benefits is long.</p><p>Which GPS watch you choose will depend on how you plan on using it.

You don't want to break the bank, but you want to get something substantial and durable enough that you won't just end up using it as an overpriced clothing rack.

duck boots women,"<p>If you've ever taken a hike in a mucky area, then you probably know how inconvenient wet socks and cold feet can be. That's where duck boots - a unique blend of hiking features and rain boots - come into play with a focus on offering traction while keeping your feet insulated against cold weather. The top of the boots extends to above the ankles, offering support while you hike, and most duck boots are lace-up, helping you to ensure that the boot keeps a good hold on your foot. Designed for the grossest and most inhospitable environments, duck boots are a sound investment for everyone from the casual hiker to the aspiring backwoods explorer.</p><p>Now, while women's duck boots have a lot in common, picking the right pair can be quite a feat. To lend a hand, we've curated a list of the best women's duck boots available along with some tips on finding the right fit.</p>"
heated gloves,"<p>If you haven't used heated gloves before, you're in for a real treat. Say goodbye to frozen limbs and chills that prevent you from doing even the simplest tasks.</p><p>During my time in the Marine Corps, I once had a company commander who was just sure that our issued cold-weather gear would instantly transform us into helpless babies. He seemed convinced that just having a beanie in your pack would make the rounds fall out of your magazine and turn into the Taliban's favorite flavor of jelly beans. If he found out about gloves that not only insulate hands from the cold but actively keep them warm, he'd probably have a seizure.</p><p>Luckily, none of us are subject to such rules on our own time. If you'd like to put modern technology to work for you and stop watching your fingers turn into icicles, you're in the right place. Let's find the perfect pair of heated gloves for you.</p>"
roof racks cars,"<p>If you've never ventured into the internet wormhole of overlanding vehicles, you're seriously missing out. Adventure-seekers have equipped everything from Jeeps to one-ton trucks and luxury SUVs with meaty tires, roof tents, and granny gears capable of scaling the most rugged terrain imaginable. Hard-core builds like that are expensive and impractical in most real-world driving scenarios, but you can get a taste of that lifestyle with a simple roof rack. According to our mathematicians, adding a roof rack to your vehicle makes it look at least 20 percent coolerâ€“and that increases to 30 percent if you drive a wagon. Better yet, there are styles to fit your vehicle and storage needs regardless of what you drive.</p><p>Should you get an open roof rack, a soft case, or a highway-ready aero box? It's hard to go wrong. Dig into these tasty recommendations and give your car extra cargo room. Maybe you'll score some style points, while you're at it.</p>"
bivy sack,"<p>Sure, you put the days of field training behind you, but there was something about sleeping out under the stars in a bivy sack that never quite left you. Tents have their place, but that one-man tent suddenly looks a bit heavy for your minimalist outdoor adventure setup. You know the areas where you'll be spending your time, and you want to move light and fast, something that tent just won't allow. Ditch the tent, and go for the bivy sack instead. Not only will your pack be lighter and your sleeping bag warmer, but you can also now be a little bit closer to nature, closer to the land, and closer to your ancestors. Now, you can restock your bivy sack memories with something a bit more enjoyable than that of your sergeant's face first thing in the morning.</p><p>Finding the best bivy sack can prove challenging. Luckily, we've narrowed down our picks to the best five.</p>"
fire starter,"<p>Being able to start a fire is one of the oldest and most elemental survival skills you can have. Striking a spark on your own is empowering, and failure is embarrassing, to say the least. It doesn't matter if the plan of the day involves firing up the grill for a gameday barbeque or creating a small fire to purify water in the wilderness, you need to create fire one way or another. In my search for the best fire starters, I encountered everything from prehistoric friction-based tools to battery-powered plasma lighters. There is also a wide selection of tinder out there to make stoking flames that much easier (no, the other tinder, although I guess that sentence would make sense both ways).</p><p> Take a look and see how far fire-starting has come since the days of smoking yourself out in a cave. Go back to your roots or take a step forward with your next purchase.</p>"
gaming chair,"<p>Whether you throw on Call of Duty to relax after a long day or use Battlefield to hone your shooting skills, games are an excellent escape from the world. Not only do PC and platform games let you tune into a different reality, but occasionally they give you a chance to fine-tune your skills. The strategy component of war games especially is a fantastic way to keep your mind sharp, first-person shooters enhance motor coordination, and multiplayer games are a terrific way to keep in touch with buddies and foster team spirit.</p><p><br/>But, as anyone who's ever played a gaming tournament knows, it's all too easy to kink your neck and strain your back - particularly without a proper chair. Picking a gaming chair is about more than just comfort, it's a matter of posture and lumbar support. Selecting a quality gaming chair ensures that when you eventually achieve victory, it isn't a Pyrrhic one for your back.</p>"

military books 2,"<p>Let's be real: 2021 wasn't really the year we all wished it had been.

rooftop tents,"<p>Some of you are in a real pickle right now. Camping is great, we all agree. But what if hiking and schlepping a week's worth of gear is not so spectacular? Car camping is the perfect solution. It's also a perfect excuse to load up on all kinds of tires, winches, coolers, and camping grills.</p><p>One of the best (and definitely one of the coolest) ways to upgrade your vehicle is to add a rooftop tent.

hiking pants,"<p>If you're an avid hiker, then you know just how important it is to find the right gear. Just like good shoes protect your feet from the elements and a hat keeps the sun's glare at bay, hiking pants keep your legs comfortable during those long rucks through the wildness. After all, when you're climbing hills and avoiding roots, you're bound to perspire. Hiking pants are designed to offer adequate ventilation while remaining strong enough to stop twigs and thorns from pricking your skin.

pepper sprays,"<p>The logic goes something like this: you can protect yourself better with a fist than a finger, and better with a firearm than a fist. That's true, but you don't have to make a direct leap from unarmed to packing heat. Pepper spray can be an extremely effective means of self-defense. It opens you up to fewer legal implications than carrying a firearm or knife, and creates an opportunity for you to escape dangerous situations without escalating to the use of deadly force. In the case of animal attacks, it can actually be more effective than a firearm. Encounters with large predators like bears can typically be resolved better by deterring them than forcing them to commit to a fight to the death (which, spoiler alert, you probably aren't going to win).</p><p>Pepper spray comes in many forms, so read up on some of the best options out there to find one that works for you.</p>"
folding knives,"<p>There I was, alone and unafraid. From my position seated atop a toilet at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, I prepared to defend myself from the nearby cucarachas that inhabited the building. Armed with only my RAT boots and a motivated folding KA-BAR, I defied staggering odds and emerged victorious from another perilous head call. With a triumphant flush, I cleaned my blade and departed from the battlefield.</p><p>Regardless of your branch of service or MOS, odds are good that a humble folding knife will end up being your most-used piece of gear. Whether on the job or enjoying a long weekend in the backcountry, a reliable, quality blade is something everyone should own. Maybe you're looking for your first knife, or maybe you've acquired a healthy collection already. You can never have too many - and the knives on this list are so good, I wouldn't blame you if you picked up one of each.</p>"
camelbak,"<p>According to doctors, most of America is in a fight for its life with dihydrogen monoxide, and those who spend extended periods of time outdoors find the war against dehydration reaching new levels of intensity. Water is heavy, and the human body needs plenty of it to thrive. Enter the CamelBak. Like the M1 Garand in World War II, this hydration system is an elite, life-saving system for which there is no substitute. When operating out in the field, a CamelBak is absolutely essential. Its high-capacity water reservoir secures all that life-giving liquid close to your back, giving you maximum mobility with minimal drag. </p><p>Whether you need to scale a cliff, fast-rope out of a helo, or shred a backcountry mountain bike trail, don't waste time pondering how to secure a puny water bottle that may or may not be along for the ride. Make like a camel, and keep your water on your back.</p>"

flasks,"<p>Who doesn't appreciate a quick nip now and then? It's all well and good when you're at home or out with friends, but what happens when the mood strikes for a sip of spirits and there's none to be found? We have it on good authority that the Donner party didn't pack enough alcohol for their trip across the Sierra Nevadas, and we know how that worked out for them (That's not to suggest correlation equals causation, but it's a very real case of people not having enough booze, then eating each other. Draw your own conclusions). You'd be smart, then, to play it safe and own a flask that can carry a few ounces of your favorite liquor.

rain ponchos,"<p>The waterproof poncho is the go-to defense against rain for military, hunters, backpackers, and soccer moms and dads alike, and for good reason.

But it may come as a surprise that, depending on your outdoor activity, some ponchos are better choices than others.</p><p>The best ponchos are waterproof, and many are truly flexible and multifunctional.

A five-course meal with caviar, a perfectly cooked filet mignon, and crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e for desert. Finally, it comes time to pay. You cringe. The scratching of Velcro as you open your ratty nylon wallet shatters the entire mood of the evening. Sure, the thing is practical and lightweight, but it lacks the versatility of a truly sophisticated wallet - a carbon fiber wallet. When your world swings from one extreme to the other, you need a wallet that will do it all. A carbon fiber wallet provides you with a tough, durable cash carrier that won't weigh you down, yet this stylish option is sure to stand out when you need to dress to the nines. </p><p>No matter what the situation, a carbon fiber wallet is the perfect financial wingman.

edc flashlights,"<p>How many times have you found yourself wishing you had skipped that cheap EDC flashlight your buddy brags about every time you visit the PX? Sure, you saved some cash, but looking back now, you should have known better than to listen to a desk jockey talking up his first EDC light. Anyone can see something cool, buy it, and swear by it, but EDC gear needs to be tough and reliable. When it comes to choosing potentially life-saving gear, never compromise. You would never trust your life to a parachute rigged by someone without the red hat, so why would you trust a light with a name without a solid reputation? Sure, you might get lucky once, but when the chips are down, why gamble again?</p><p>To that end, we've rounded up some of the best EDC flashlights on the market.

rifle cases,"<p>There are plenty of options for rifle cases in the world. Sure, you can throw your rifle in a shopping bag or a tennis racket case, like some people. And as cool as that looks in that one low-budget John Wick knockoff you saw that one time, it doesn't do much to protect your rifle in transit. That's why I took the time out of my day to sit down with the cases I own and what the market offers to narrow down the best options for you and what you need.</p><p>We've lined up some of the best rifle cases on the market today to help you sort through the nonsense and make the right purchase.

camping cots,"<p>What's the difference between camping and spending a week in the field? Well, for starters, you can get more than two hours of sleep without being woken up for firewatch. You can cook up bacon and eggs instead of destroying your digestive system with the failed chemical experiment that is MRE cheese. Perhaps most importantly, you can find a comfortable place to sleep without fighting with other people for the most ergonomically supportive patch of dirt to lay on. Camping by foot will limit you to foam or inflatable sleeping pads, but driving to the campsite opens up a world of possibilities. By equipping your tent or cabin with a camping cot, you can sleep better and wake up ready for another day of hiking, hunting, or releasing your inner Henry David Thoreau.</p><p>We found camping cots ranging from classic to contemporary, so dig in and find a better way to sleep outdoors.</p>"
backpacking water filters,"<p>When traveling through the backcountry, water is life, and knowing where to find water and how to purify or filter water are essential wilderness skills. At 8.34 pounds per gallon, water is also one of the heaviest things to strap on your back, so being able to replenish water along the way lightens your load and extends how far you can travel. In an emergency or survival situation, being able to access safe water could mean the difference between life and death, as humans can go about three weeks without food but only three days without water. Water is life, and you never want to be caught without it.</p><p>There are a lot of portable water filters and purifiers on the market, so we reviewed the best backpacking water filters out of all of them to help you make the purchase that's right for you.

camping grills,"<p>I'll admit to not using a camping grill for a long time. I was a practicing member of the American Society for Clif Bars and Jetboil Ramen. As a result, my off-grid nutrition was adequate, but not the kind of thing you'd get excited about.</p><p>That's when I discovered the overland craze. I saw people whipping out grills and cooking ribeye, fresh vegetables, and the earthly heaven that is a cast-iron-skillet cobbler. Goodness gracious. Suddenly, a camping grill appeared very high on my list of priorities.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you prefer gas, charcoal, or wood; there's a grill out there that can transform your camping experience. These portable grills are designed to be relatively compact and easy to transport without making a mess of your car or RV like the hibachis of the past. They won't just make you like campsite cooking more-they might make it your preferred way to prepare a meal.</p>"
camping accessories upgrade,"<p>If you're lucky enough to go camping in your free time, you're also lucky enough to choose your own equipment. Sure, our ancestors camped under the stars with nothing but a rock for a pillow, but they also died of exposure or got run over in their sleep by a wild boar at the ripe old age of 15. You can do better. Once you have the essentials taken care of, you can start looking for ways to upgrade your camping experience â€“ especially if you're traveling in a vehicle rather than on foot. With a few key purchases, you can eat better, sleep more comfortably, and bring your favorite playlist - all while maximizing your camping budget. That sounds like a wilderness oasis you'll never want to leave.</p><p>Here are a few items that strike the perfect balance between civilization and frontier survival. You might even have money left over for provisions.</p>"
rifle cases,"<p>There are plenty of options for rifle cases in the world. Sure, you can throw your rifle in a shopping bag or a tennis racket case, like some people. And as cool as that looks in that one low-budget John Wick knockoff you saw that one time, it doesn't do much to protect your rifle in transit. That's why I took the time out of my day to sit down with the cases I own and what the market offers to narrow down the best options for you and what you need.</p><p>We've lined up some of the best rifle cases on the market today to help you sort through the nonsense and make the right purchase. A good gun case isn't just going to be a bag to stuff your rifle into, it will protect it in transit, support accessories, and carry your mags - and more - without breaking the bank.</p>"
6 person tents,"<p>Are you sick of cramming your entire family into small tents with overlapping sleeping pads and gear packed in every nook and cranny? Well, we're here to help you take your camping experience to the next level with the best six-person tents. With ample space, six-person tents are great for big groups - and even a couple dogs. But, you'll want to do a little research first, before picking out a tent of this size.<br/><br/>In this review, we've reviewed a variety of tents, from dome-shaped to cabin tents, to determine the best six-person tent for a variety of missions. We found tents well-suited for glamping and others good for three-season camping. Some have enormous vestibules (the camping equivalent of a ""mudroom""), while others have open, mesh exteriors for stargazing. While you'll want to look elsewhere if you want a lightweight backpacking tent, these six-person tents will meet all your backcountry needs.</p>"

safety glasses,"<p>When you realize you have a full life to live still, why hold back? Whether you hope to travel around the world in 80 days on the back of your Kawasaki, plan to turn your blacksmithing hobby into a full-time career, or simply make your living by mixing chemicals day in and day out, nothing is more valuable than your eyesight. When sparks start flying and you've got a deadline to meet, the last thing you need on your mind is keeping those sparks out of your face so you can keep your eye on the prize. Whether you work inside or outside, whether you wear prescription lenses or not, proper eye protection is no area for compromise. </p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of options out there, perfectly designed for just about any activity you could ever imagine. So, don a pair of safety glasses and show the world who's boss.</p>"
survival backpacks,"<p>In an emergency, a properly equipped survival backpack may be all that stands between life and death. Survival is a simple task that has become surprisingly difficult for the modern American. When chaos rules the day, obtaining food, water, warmth, and shelter become disastrously difficult for the unprepared. Throw in a medical emergency or an aggressive predator, and a miniature apocalypse can demolish your chances of survival. However, the trained and equipped individual with the right mindset (and quality gear) can overcome all.</p><p>While these packs do share some overlap with bug out bags, go bags, and EDC bags, a dedicated survival backpack is loaded with everything you need to survive a given situation and nothing more. These packs are tough for customers able to resist the weather, the environment, and your own rough treatment while being as user-friendly as possible. Not sure what that looks like? We got you covered.</p>"
coffee makers accessories,"<p>Coffee might just be hot bean water, but it takes a surprising amount of finesse to get it just right. You're probably better off with a morning Monster than the syrup-based swill you'll find at the gas station, and the good stuff usually comes with an inflated price and an atmosphere that's just a little too hipster. It would be better if you could get great coffee, brewed just the way you like it, in the comfort of your own home - and with a small investment and a few adjustments to your morning routine, you can have it all.</p><p>One or two carefully chosen purchases can have you sipping espresso or stockpiling cold brew like a pro. Each style of coffee has its own tools, and all it takes is a little practice to be proficient with them. Here are six that can turn you into a connoisseur of caffeine.</p>"
camping hammocks,"<p>In recent years, seasoned backpackers and car campers alike have all but abandoned their tents to sleep under the stars in camping hammocks. Cocooned in soft fabric and immersed in the sweet embrace of nature, sleeping in hammocks is a great alternative to tents; even better, they're often more affordable and lighter.

gym bags,"<p>You know the drill, literally: the demands of both the field and the gym require supplies that can keep up. Whether you train in the gym or by running laps, you need a gym bag that can store all your supplies. Water. Change of clothes. Shoes. Your wallet and pocket knife. A snack. The needs just keep adding up. And don't just go with any old backpack - you need something that will let your post-workout gear breathe, but is also tough enough to support tactical gear without busting at the seams. Real fitness requires having the right tools on hand, and nothing beats a solid gym bag when it comes to keeping them all together.</p><p>It can be tricky to spot a gym bag that's worth the investment. To lend a hand, we've tracked down high-quality, military-inspired gym bags so you can confidently store your workout gear in style.</p>"

The best gun belts do this through the use of superior materials, innovative designs, and rock-solid quality control.</p><p>We've compiled a list of our top picks in the various categories that are encompassed under the general moniker of ""gun belts.""

survival radios,"<p>A reliable survival radio is a must-have in absolutely any emergency kit. Whether you choose a compact hand-crank radio you can carry with you or a solar-powered larger model to keep in your home or car kit, you have to have a radio you can rely on. When disaster strikes and you find yourself in a survival setting, your radio will go farther than your smartphone. Radios, both regular radios and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather radios, will relay critical emergency information. Radios are more reliable than smartphones, as you'll always be able to get a signal; radio waves also travel farther than LTE. When cell phone lines are jammed or down, your radio will be your only connection to updates. </p><p>If you're searching for just the right survival radio, there are plenty of options available.

uv flashlights,"<p>Just because you can't see it with the naked eye doesn't mean the danger isn't there - and that applies whether you're at home or in a filthy barracks somewhere. UV flashlights enhance your ability to observe and identify risks, especially bodily fluids. Since fluids like blood and urine are a biohazard, it's important to know when they are around; under ultraviolet light, these fluids glow so you can spot them in an instant. While it can't tell you if there is a specific pathogen in your environment, a UV light can tell you the risk is there.</p><p>When it comes to health and safety, it's very important to ensure the quality of the tools you're using, especially if you can't rely on your basic senses for a full assessment.

two way radio,"<p>Communication is key, especially when it comes to survival situations. You could be exploring new terrain, tracking down a target, or just be well out of cell range. Whatever the circumstances, two-way radios ensure that you can always touch base with your crew. Of course, not all radios are made alike. When it comes to maintaining a tactical advantage, you need something that's durable, with a powerful battery and a broad range. While most two-way radios look similar, finding something that can work in the most strenuous settings is both an art and a science. Just imagine how long The Longest Day could have been had U.S. troops not been using quality tech. </p><p>So, to save you time and make it easier to choose the best two-way radios around, we've detailed the leading options. Check out this breakdown for everything you need to know about this critical tech.</p>"
kerosene heaters,"<p>Temperatures drop, but your zeal for home improvement projects doesn't. Good on you. Garages, workshops, and job sites aren't always the most forgiving places to be, and bundling up like the little brother in A Christmas Story can only do so much. You might be better off adding a heater to your repertoire and letting a can of kerosene take the frost out of the air. Compared to electric space heaters, kerosene heaters produce significantly more heat. They're also surprisingly efficient. Just a gallon of kerosene can keep you warm for hours. There are a few considerations to keep in mind, like high temperatures and fumes that require adequate ventilation, but those are easy to account for.</p><p>When you're ready to take your winter projects to the next level, pick up a can of fuel and one of these kerosene heaters. You'll be up and running in no time.</p>"

hunting backpacks,"<p>Light in, heavy out. That's the way a good hunt goes. Pack in the basics and pack out a truckload of meat. Of course, your truck may be miles away, so a quality hunting backpack is more than just a nicety. That trophy moose isn't going anywhere unless YOU pack it to the truck yourself.</p><p>Often, the best game is the hardest to reach. Whether you're chasing New Mexico elk or the mountain goats of Montana, the best way in is on foot, and what you don't pack in, you'll never have on hand. Like hardcore backpackers, dedicated hunters need a dedicated bag to pack in their gear, but unlike hikers, successful hunters will have a harvest far heavier than most backpackers will ever dream of hauling. This makes the best hunting backpacks one-of-a-kind pieces of equipment with plenty of design features no other outdoorsman would ever need.</p>"
military lego sets,"<p>Let's take a quick break from the workday to revisit one of our favorite childhood toys. Lego is stepping back from military-themed toys for some reason, but there are still a few sets out there and plenty of competitors are picking up their slack (it turns out plastic rectangles aren't that hard to make).I took it upon myself to wade into the military toy segment to bring you a follow-up to our informative and totally serious Nerf gear guide. I present to you the most representative and entertaining Lego sets for each branch of the U.S. military. I found something that soldiers, sailors, Marines, coasties, airmen, and guardians (sorry, but how the hell did ""startans"" and ""floaty bois"" get vetoed?) can all have a laugh at. </p><p>Next time you have a gift exchange with your interservice buddies, you can thank us for doing the legwork for you.</p>"
zoom binoculars,"<p>There are a lot of ways to extend your vision. Binoculars, spotting scopes, and rifle optics can all be incredibly useful in the field. Hunters and bird-watchers alike have long used binoculars to see into the distance and burn through brush. If there's one downside to this kind of gear, it's the potential to spend a lot of money on specialized equipment that performs in a relatively narrow range of environments.</p><p>Zoom binoculars, also known as variable-power binoculars, earned their share of the optics market by proving their versatility. With magnification capabilities as low as eight power and as high as 125 power, zoom binoculars can serve as your one-stop-shop for extended vision. They might not be quite as clear as fixed-power binoculars, but the tradeoff is one you should definitely consider. Add in the compelling price of these binoculars, and you've got a great piece of gear.</p>"
hiking watch,"<p>Punctuality is always important - even if you're hiking in the wilderness.

Nowadays, we can monitor more than ever before with watches able to help you navigate, track barometric pressure and altitude, and even assess your vitals. The tactical value of watches is beyond reproach. Heading into parts unknown to hike highlights this all the more. It might not be the same as setting your watch for a critical op, but when sunset sneaks up on you, it can feel pretty vital. </p><p>Hiking watches are rugged, durable, and long-lasting, letting you rough it outdoors without taking on unnecessary risk.

water rowing machines,"<p>One of the more interesting niches in the fitness world is that of water rowing machines, or hydro rowers. Anyone who has done CrossFit has become intimate with rowing machines and knows how intense a rowing workout can be. Rowing is a full-body strength exercise that has a cardio aspect, too.

survival watch,"<p>The sun hangs low in the arctic sky. Growing weary from exposure to the elements, you lose track of time as days become weeks. You check your survival watch. It's time to eat some marmot jerky, face outboard, change your socks, and carry on.</p><p>I'm not saying that exact scenario is going to happen, but you'd feel pretty dumb if it did and you didn't have a watch to remind you about marmot-eating time after I specifically warned you. What makes a good survival watch? Reliability is the main thing. Fragile gear has no place in your survival kit. Beyond that, there are a few strategies you can use. GPS watches offer the most technology and features. Automatic watches free you from worrying about your battery going dead.

fitness equipment,"<p>So, you want to get strong. What are you doing about it? Hopefully, you've built a program based on real science rather than bro science; more Jim Wendler and less of the fitness magazines at the checkout counter. An effective workout plan starts with homework, gains traction with proper form, and certainly benefits from arming yourself with the right tools. Don't be fooled into thinking that your cross-trainers and a $5 protein shake from the front desk are all you need to reach your potential. Seek out the strongest lifters at your gym, and you'll notice they all have the same fitness equipment in their gym bag. They probably all read the same studies and watch the same videos, too.</p><p>When you're ready to start treating your gym bag like a tool box, be sure to make your money count by considering a few of these essentials.</p>"

The perfect carving knife is an absolute must, but make sure not to forget about the cutting board. Yes, we're sure you could cut on the countertop or some plate from the cupboard, but really, only amateurs take those kinds of shortcuts.

But there's one big problem with most of today's smartphones: They're incredibly delicate.

long range scopes,"<p>Long-range shooting is an art form of the highest form. Legends like Carlos Hathcock trigger reactions of awe and admiration among those who hear their names, and POGs who couldn't hit the broad side of the Pentagon with their eyes wide open start dreaming of ringing steel plates at 1,000, 2,000, and even 3,000 meters. Ah, yes, to be a long-range shooter is to be the Michaelangelo of wind, lead, and cordite.</p><p>Of course, such dreams shatter the moment an aspiring long-distance marksman recognizes his lack of a long-range optic. Without a good long-range scope, nobody's hitting anything, even with the planet's best ammo and rifle combination in their hands. On the flip side, the proper optic on a proper rifle with proper ammo reignites a small glimmer of hope that someday the title of ""long-range sniper"" might somehow still be attainable.</p>"
compasses,"<p>Why do I need to know which is the best compass when I've got a GPS? That's a great question, and I have a great and simple answer: technology breaks and batteries die. But even if the polar ice caps melt away completely and Las Vegas becomes the finest post-apocalyptic beachfront resort left in the world, the magnetic poles of the Earth will still be magnetic.</p><p>We are lucky to live in a time when most of our navigation needs can be solved by the little supercomputer most of us carry in our pockets these days. They can tell you where you are, how to get where you're going, where there are traffic jams along the way, and where to find the best craft cocktails or authentic street tacos when you get there. But sometimes, that device is no longer an option.</p>"

When you're stuffing your cupboard full of emergency supplies for the end of times, do yourself a favor and pack something you'll actually want to eat.</p><p>Heavy canned goods are great as long as you don't plan on going anywhere. MREs are fine if you enjoy scheduling survival activities around your weekly toilet devotionals. Freeze-dried food is better than both of those options, and we found options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner that you can actually look forward to eating. There might even be a little bit of POG-ey bait in there for dessert. </p><p>Now, pour a glass of wine and join me on this culinary adventure through a day in your post-apocalyptic life with the best freeze dried food worth noshing on.</p>"

concealed carry holsters for women,"<p>Picking a cute outfit for your day is already hard enough, but adding a gun and a bulky holster to the equation just complicates things further. Most holsters were designed for a man wearing a loose-fitting shirt and pants, meaning women who want to carry must conform to that standard.

gun safes under 1000,"<p>Whether you choose to think of your firearms collection as a set of tools, hobbyist collection, or Second Amendment bastion of freedom, most enthusiasts recognize that guns need to be stored properly.

That value, when combined with their ease of transportability and the possibility of them being stolen and subsequently used in criminal behavior, means that effective gun storage should be a top priority for any firearm owner. While a gun safe will help keep your firearms organized and safe, good ones tend to run on the expensive side. </p><p>Luckily, we're here to help you out.

adirondack chairs,"<p>The early 1900s were an exciting time to be alive. People were inventing things like air conditioning, tractors, and blimps, often with mixed results. At the same time, an upstate New Yorker named Harry Bunnell was credited with inventing one of our favorite pieces of furniture: the Adirondack chair. Supposedly, the design he patented actually came from a friend who was trying to help him make some extra cash; if that's true, it makes him a bit of a bastard. In either case, the chair was a smash hit. The Adirondack chair is still a staple of backyard renovations today, and we'd be remiss if we didn't advise you to pick up a few of your own.</p><p>Whether you want a traditional chair or loveseat, wood or synthetic materials, there are plenty of great Adirondack chairs available.</p>"

under bed gun safes,"<p>Securing your guns in an under-bed gun safe may not be the best choice for some people, but for others, no other option can compete with the unique advantages of keeping your firearms virtually under your pillow. Full-size safes with a two-hour fire rating and a 50-gun capacity sure are handy, but not everyone has the cash or the space for such a tough customer in their home. For others, a bedside gun safe simply cannot secure their home defense Mossberg 590. Thankfully, most under-bed gun safes offer plenty of space to store a defensive long gun and can be a cost-conscious alternative to bigger, heavier safes that might seem more at home in a bank than your bedroom.

duffel bags,"<p>Duffel bags are practically a way of life for athletes and the military alike. The large capacity and convenience of duffel bags are what made them popular in the first place. Originally named for the specific type of fabric they were made from, duffel bags were adopted by the military during the World Wars and enhanced thereafter to become the standard issue sea bag. Just for fun: Show any Marine a picture of a mountain of sea bags and watch them cringe.</p><p>Traditionally, duffel bags were shapeless woolen bags with rope drawstrings that held a lot of gear, but were difficult to carry. Today you can buy duffels with wheels and shoulder straps to make using them easier. We've done the research and have found the best duffel bags just for you.</p>"
ankle weights,"<p>If you have limited space in your house or you don't want to spend a ton of money on home gym equipment, ankle weights are a great solution.

cigar humidors,"<p>Old-school cigar shops feel like stepping into another time. Being surrounded by dark-stained hardwood and leather batwing chairs can make us all feel more like James Bond than our chain-smoking uncle. Wouldn't it be nice to have that experience at home? Imagine ushering your guests into a walk-in humidor filled with exotic cigars from around the world. Sure, that would be great, but it's pretty unrealistic. That doesn't mean you can't create a scaled-down version of that experience by popping the lid on your own personal humidor. If you enjoy a cigar every now and then, treat it right and keep it fresh. Otherwise, you might as well be puffing on a flavored smoke from the gas station.</p><p>Upgrade your special occasion stogies with a cigar humidor from our collection of favorites.</p>"
handheld gps,"<p>A handheld GPS unit can be a tremendous asset in the field, but you'd better know what you're doing if you're going to use one effectively. That starts with understanding the basics of what makes them tick and how to navigate without one.</p><p>The GPS (Global Positioning System) network includes 31 satellites owned by the United States. Alternative networks include China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, the European Union's Galileo system, Russia's GLONASS, India's IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) and NavIC (Navigation Indian Constellation), and Japan's QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System).</p><p>We found reliable devices that tap into a variety of these networks to bring you accurate, dependable location data all over the world. Whether you're coordinating troop movements overseas or just finding a great hunting spot, these handheld GPS devices have you covered.</p>"
rechargeable flashlight,"<p>We may not use flashlights all that often, but they're critical when we do need them. Most of us have a few old-school flashlights stashed away with batteries that haven't held electricity in ages. That's a problem for two reasons. First of all, you're putting yourself in position to not have a working flashlight in a dire moment. Second, you're throwing money away every time you replace batteries that discharged most of their energy over time. You can solve both problems with a rechargeable flashlight. No more searching for the right size of battery, no more overpaying for batteries, and no more dim flashlights letting you down.</p><p>We found several options that you should consider. In addition to handheld flashlights, this list includes rechargeable options for the campsite, garage, and survival situations.</p>"

slip joint knives,"<p>Among the overwhelming selection of possible EDC knives on today's market, the classic slip joint knife has gotten lost in the shuffle. Sadly, many people's first knife uses anything but this simple, easy-to-use design for fear of being ""bitten"" by a blade without a mechanical lock. While grandpa may have never owned a smartphone, he certainly knew his way around knives, and there are plenty of reasons why he always kept a handy slip joint in his pocket. Uncle Sam may no longer be issuing folding knives to the majority of U.S. troops these days, but you can bet your challenge coin that the Joes at Anzio and Chosin had their trusty slip joint knife handy should the need arise, because sometimes, a Ka-Bar is overkill, even for a Marine.</p>"
rangefinders,"<p>No one is questioning your ability to estimate range by referencing your ACSS reticle or imagining how many football fields could fit between you and the target, but we might suggest that a rangefinder could improve your shooting. Hunting and recreational shooting require you to account for things like wind, humidity, and temperature - not to mention the type and consistency of ammunition you're using. Maintaining thorough notes for data on previous engagements is important, and you can make those notes a lot more accurate by using actual ranges rather than estimated ones.</p><p>Even NASA engineers use calculators, and you should take advantage of available technology, too. A proper rangefinder can take your shot placement from accurate to dead-on balls accurate (it's an industry term) in the blink of an eye.</p>"
hiking socks,"<p>Hiking can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors, provided you're equipped with the right gear. Tough, versatile socks are definitely one of the most essential things to have on hand. Every prepared hiker has a spare pair of socks in their gear. Walking with wet feet is more than uncomfortable, it can actually be risky to your health and wellbeing. From perspiration to puddles, it's easy for moisture to get into your socks, making it all the more important to choose something that wicks it away.</p><p>With so many options, it can be tricky to identify which hiking socks are going to be comfortable and durable. To help you along, we've curated a list of the best hiking socks around so your next excursion can be that much better.</p>"

That's why I put together this guide of the best tactical pants for 2022.</p><p>As a firearms instructor, I wear tactical pants designed for my needs like running, gunning, and teaching. When I buy a pair, I look for features I know I need based on my experience as well as those of other informed buyers like other instructors, shooters, hunters, and more.</p><p>Using that collective knowledge, I reviewed numerous options and examined things like materials, pockets, waterproofing, fitment, durability, and price to help you make the most informed decision you can before buying a pair of tactical pants.</p>"

backpack brands,"<p>As kids, finding the best backpack brands came down to which ones had our favorite cartoon characters on them. These days, it's a little more complicated. You probably have specialized gear for life in the military, camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, school, and travel. It only makes sense that your backpack would be purpose-built, too.<br/>Buying into a quality brand saves you from buyer's remorse. It also saves money in the long term and keeps gear out of the landfill because you can rely on a solid pack to last many years. Of all the manufacturers out there, I picked what I consider to be the best backpack brands in several categories and chose one model that you can buy to take full advantage of everything each brand has to offer.</p>"

butterfly knives,"<p>From Philippine urbanites to movie vigilantes and TV show goons, nothing seems cooler than a butterfly knife.

They're sleek showpieces, razor-sharp deterrents, and masterfully elegant tools when placed in equally-masterful hands.</p><p>Fancying yourself a butterfly knife of your own?

running headphones,"<p>Whether you are a marathon runner or a casual jogger, you're going to need a good pair of running headphones to listen to your favorite pump-up playlist. In recent years, with the introduction of Apple AirPods, many headphone companies have abandoned their cords and gone completely wireless.

gun cleaning kits,"<p>Whether you love it or hate it, if you shoot, you'll have to clean your gun eventually.

hiking shorts,"<p>Whether you're new to hiking or a seasoned trekker, it's vital to wear the proper clothing so you don't get chafed or soaking wet from sweat. In addition to the right footwear, socks, pants, and shirts, you may want to invest in a comfortable yet functional pair of hiking shorts. While they provide less coverage than pants, they're a good option if you plan on spending the day in hot and humid conditions.</p><p>Unfortunately, not all hiking shorts are created equal. Some are more durable than others. They also differ in their material construction, UPF protection, moisture-wicking capability, and overall functionality, particularly when it comes to pockets. We did the research so you don't have to. Check out the best hiking shorts available online and in stores.</p>"
hardshell jackets,"<p>People who know their way around the backcountry dress in layers, and that all starts with the best hardshell jacket for the job. Protecting yourself against the elements should be a top priority. Insulated mid-layers and moisture-wicking base layers are important, too, but they can't help you if the wind and rain get involved. Your outermost layer has an outsized effect on how well you'll do in the wild.</p><p>We combined personal experience with online research to nail down exactly what separates good hardshell jackets from substandard ones. Then, we combed through the best backcountry and alpine apparel brands to find jackets that meet that criteria, factoring in enough variety to satisfy different needs.

solar phone chargers,"<p>Thanks to cell phones, we can now walk around with the cumulative knowledge of humanity in the palm of our hand. The problem is that, once you venture out from the world of wall outlets and 12-volt car outlets, our phones have a very limited lifespan. If you plan on camping, hiking, or doing serious off-grid travel, stopping to charge your phone may not be an option. To keep all those apps, maps, and your camera handy, you'd better pick up a solar charger. These handy devices take up very little room, and can keep your phone and other devices charged anywhere there's sunlight.</p><p>Take a look at our list of go-to solar phone chargers and keep those electronics charged with the power of the sun itself.</p>"

Whether you prefer open or concealed carry, the cross-draw holster provides easy access to a defensive weapon by positioning your firearm close at hand in virtually any situation. While you may never be Doc Holliday, it's easy to see why the ailing gambler used such a setup and why maybe you should, too.</p>"

1911 holsters,"<p>The 1911 pistol is one of the longest-running service weapons in military history. It's rugged, accurate, and packs a massive punch. Compared to modern duty weapons, though, it's heavy and gets even heavier when you load it. So, if you decide to carry one, finding the best 1911 holster is an absolute must.</p><p>Because the 1911 handgun has weight issues - even ones with a smaller five-inch barrel - any type of realistic concealed carry option is out of the question.

We'll also explain how we found our choices and evaluated them against the competition.</p>"
tactical watches,"<p>Tactical watches are a difficult category to define, simply because unlike things like solar watches or dive watches, there's no specific quality that makes them tactical. In our efforts to determine what counted as one of our picks for work watches for the military, we defined ""tactical"" as durable, legible, accurate, and in common use with U.S. service members today - and every single one of these, with one exception, hits all four.</p><p>The best tactical watches are ready for whatever mission that you throw at them, and these watches prove that ""military grade"" isn't just a term thrown around by people who don't know what they're talking about. Read on and find a tactical watch that belongs on your wrist.</p>"
solar watches,"<p>Quartz watches have been a mainstay of timekeeping since the late 1970s because they're extremely accurate, very low maintenance, and affordable. Unlike a mechanical watch, a quartz watch is battery-powered, so instead of constantly winding it, you change the battery every few years. Today, the best quartz watches are solar-powered.</p><p>Solar technology has improved significantly over the years. Instead of only having an unsightly black grid as an option, you'll find solar panels hidden in ornate dials that even charge under artificial light, so you can find a solar-powered watch that looks great and never quits. In this article, we rolled up our sleeves, scoured the jewelry stores, and tried out some watches to find the best solar watches available.</p>"
shooting mats,"<p>As any hunter or rifleman will tell you, a considerable amount of time can pass between setting up in your hide and breaking the perfect shot at your quarry. More often than not, that time is spent lying prone somewhere cold, damp, and muddy. Far from being a mere creature comfort, a quality shooting mat can help you maintain a better state of readiness and keep your focus on the task at hand.</p><p>In this article, we group shooting mats into two categories: field and range. Field mats are lightweight and easily carried into the backcountry, but are more austere than range mats which are ideal for shooting at established facilities or when operating in close proximity to a vehicle.</p>"

chronograph watches,"<p>Chronograph watches are wrist-mounted stopwatches that have kept time for the most extreme activities of the 20th century. For as long as humans have sought to time the speed over a certain distance of an object, they have sought devices to measure this. These are iconic designs and have become some of the most sought-after watches in the world, owing to their association with automotive racing, flight, and space travel, as well as the films that covered these topics.</p><p>These are the best chronograph watches, certified classics, worn or owned by the team as well as astronauts, racers, and pilots from the golden age of analog timekeeping. Here's why one of them deserves a place on your wrist.</p>"
backpacking tents,"<p>In the world of long-distance backpacking, we're super concerned about weight, especially with backpacking tents. Your tent is one of the ""big three"" items you carry in terms of weight - the other two being your sleep system and your backpack itself. As the old minimalist saying goes: Less is more. Less weight is more distance, more enjoyment, and also more cost.</p><p>Backpacking tents are generally classified around two main characteristics: the number of sleepers, or capacity, and the weather conditions they will be used in. Three-season tents are generally designed for spring, summer, and fall use, while four-season tents tend to be made out of more rugged materials to withstand winter snow and high winds on mountains.</p>"

tent stakes,"<p>When you think about camping prep, tent stakes might not be the first thing to come to your mind. However, once you get to the site and pitch the tent, if you find yourself short a stake (or relying on low-quality ones), you'll wish you'd thought ahead. Tent stakes are designed to attach your tent firmly to the ground.

kydex holsters,"<p>When it comes to concealed carry holsters, Kydex is a popular choice. Gear makers have come to favor thermoplastic over traditional materials like leather or nylon because it's easy to mold to a firearm and any accessories mounted to it. Kydex delivers a superior performance not just because of how well it fits the gun, but because of how well it retains its shape.

citizen watches,"<p>Citizen is far from just another brand at the PX. The Japanese company is a legendary watchmaking giant.

red dot sights,"<p>A red dot sight will help you shoot better with any kind of firearm. That's because the optic reduces skills like sight alignment and sight picture down to simply aiming a dot - usually red, sometimes green, and occasionally gold - at a target.

gun safes under 500,"<p>A good, quality gun safe serves multiple purposes. In addition to helping prevent unauthorized access by children, family members, and burglars, they can also protect against fire and water damage, with some models even offering door seals that protect against smoke damage as well. We have all seen stories of mass shootings committed by someone who had access to a parent or guardian's firearm that wasn't properly secured, or heard of a person struggling with mental health finding a family member's gun and using it to take their own life. Having your guns locked up is not a perfect solution, but it can help prevent tragedies like this from occurring.</p>"

spotlights,"<p>Spotlights are easily one of the most underrated tools for nighttime work. Prior to the LED revolution, spotlights were a commonly found tool for night shifts everywhere. At the time, flashlights weren't very strong, but now that you can easily find a 1,000-lumen flashlight, spotlights have started to fade from popularity.

These handheld powerhouses are specifically made to illuminate objects hundreds of yards away.</p><p>If you work or play after the sun goes down, then you need to consider adding one of the best spotlights to your gear locker.</p>"
