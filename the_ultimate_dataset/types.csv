dumbbell sets,"<h2>Types of dumbells</h2><p>Dumbbells come in a variety of sizes, shapes and weights. There are even options for adjustable dumbbell handles. The most important thing to consider when purchasing a set is the weight you plan on lifting. Dumbbell sets can range from five pounds to more than 100 pounds. You'll need to know which type of set you're getting into before making your purchase.</p><h3>There are three main types of dumbbells: barbells, kettlebells, and weighted dumbbells.</h3><p>Barbells are long and cylindrical with a fixed handle that is held in the hand opposite the weight being lifted. The weight is attached via a steel or iron chain (or a nylon cord in some cases).</p><p>Kettlebells have a rounded shape with a flared lip that helps secure grip. Unlike barbells, they dont have a fixed handle; instead, the handle is adjustable in length to accommodate different hand sizes. This allows users to use a more natural grip and take advantage of their body weight.</p><p>Weighted dumbbells are designed to balance the weight as well as possible while still allowing the user to lift and lower it using a pulley system. These dumbbells feature an internal spring, which helps maintain the proper tension on the cable during use.</p><h3>Traditional dumbbell sets</h3><p>These dumbbell sets are made with steel or aluminum weights that are attached to a handle using screws. They are inexpensive and easy to use. Their main feature is that they're very durable. Over time, the metal will wear down and rust though, so they won't last forever but if you have plans to use these dumbbell sets for years to come, they'll do the job.</p><h3>Fixed vs. Adjustable Handles</h3><p>When it comes to handles, there are two options: fixed and adjustable.</p><p>Fixed handles are standard on barbells and weighted dumbbells. The handle is made from steel or cast iron, and its position is unchangeable. These handles tend to be sturdier than adjustable handles, but they cost more.</p><p>Adjustable handles allow you to change the angle of the handle to suit your own needs. The handle is usually made of plastic, though in some cases its metal. Adjustable handles are easier to clean and adjust, but they cost more.</p><h3>Weights</h3><p>Dumbbells come in a wide range of weights, from tiny 10-pounders all the way up to massive 100-pounders. The most common weight ranges are 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 pounds. For beginners looking to start a weight-training program, a lighter dumbbell is often the best choice. As your strength increases, you can always add more weight to a dumbbell set. Some people prefer to buy dumbbells in pairs, while others prefer to buy them in sets. Sets typically come with a weight range, such as 10-20 pounds, and allow you to gradually increase the weight you are lifting over time.</p><p>If you are unsure of what weight to start with, it is always best to consult with a personal trainer or your doctor before beginning any new exercise program. For beginners looking to start a weight-training program, a lighter dumbbell is often the best choice. As your strength increases, you can always add more weight to a dumbbell set.</p><h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When choosing dumbbell sets for this list, we relied on personal experience with a variety of different brands.</p><p>We also looked at customer reviews to find out what people were saying about these brands and their products. Customer reviews are a great way to see what other people think about a product, but keep in mind that one person's opinion isn't necessarily representative of the entire market.</p><p>Finally, we looked at what others in the fitness industry have to say about dumbbell sets. We read reviews from fitness bloggers and fitness magazines. We wanted to make sure that the dumbbell sets we chose were made by brands that have good reputations in the fitness community.</p>"

cell phone boosters for rural areas,"<h2>Types of cellphone boosters</h2><p>There are a few different types of cellphone boosters, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages.<p><h3>Amplifiers</h3><p>Amplifiers are the most common type of cellphone booster. They work by amplifying the signal that your cellphone receives from the tower. Amplifiers are usually the most affordable type of booster, and they're easy to install. However, they can only amplify the signal that your phone receives, so they won't do anything to improve the signal that your phone sends to the tower.</p><h3>Repeaters</h3><p>Repeaters are a more expensive type of cellphone booster.

camping lanterns,"<h2>Types of camping lanterns</h2><p>There are many types of camping lanterns on the market. let's take a look at all the different ones, explain how they work and who they could benefit.</p><h3>Propane Lanterns</h3><p>One of the most common camping lanterns is the propane lantern. They are very easy to use and can give you a lot of light. The only downside to these lanterns is that they do require batteries, which can be expensive if you go through them quickly.</p><p>These lanterns work by using a small amount of propane gas to produce light. The gas is burned in a mantle, which is located inside the lantern. The mantle gets very hot and produces a bright light.Propane lanterns are great for campers who want a lot of light without having to worry about batteries. They are also very easy to use and maintain.</p><h3>Battery Operated Lanterns</h3><p>Another type of camping lantern is the battery operated lantern. These lanterns are powered by batteries, so you don't have to worry about propane or mantles.

edc flashlights,"<h2>Types of EDC flashlights</h2><h3>Tactical flashlight</h3><p>The tactical light is the most common EDC flashlight. Similar to how ink feeds an octopus, these defensive lights emit a blinding light that allows users to flee a threat without needlessly aggravating the situation. Aside from their remarkable lumen output, these lights frequently incorporate protruding bezels designed to give them a little extra bite in worst-case scenarios. Because of the abuse they may be subjected to, these lights are almost always made of aluminum, thanks to its solid mix of strength and lightweight.</p><h3>Penlight</h3><p>Penlights, like defensive EDC lights, are meant for convenient everyday carry, but their power is sometimes substantially lower than that of their more aggressive brothers. These lights, on the other hand, are intended for administrative and other professional chores such as pipe inspections. These lights, as the name implies, are the size and style of huge pens. Penlights of high quality are composed of sturdy plastic, however, aluminum ones are also available. versions do exist as well.</p><h3>Keychain flashlight</h3><p>As the name implies, these lights attach to your keys rather than clipping onto some pocket. Usually, these flashlights are supplemental EDC lights designed for finding locks in the dark or digging through a handbag. As such, they prevent self-defense lights from being pressed into service on a daily basis, leaving them free to focus on their intended mission.</p><h3>Headlamp</h3><p>These lights, as the name says, connect to your keys rather than a pocket. These flashlights are typically additional EDC lights intended for finding locks in the dark or searching through a handbag. As a result, they keep self-defense lights from being called into action on a daily basis, allowing them to concentrate on their intended mission.</p><h3>Magnetic flashlight</h3><p>Magnetic lights are relatively uncommon, but they bring a lot to the table. They usually include a powerful magnet that allows them to be attached to any ferrous object in your vicinity. These lights can be hung from pipes, screwed into walls or used as mobile under-the-hood lamps so you can keep both hands free to work.</p><h3>Rechargeable flashlight</h3><p>These EDC lights have internal batteries that must be recharged on a regular basis. Usually, USB plugs and cradles are included with these bulbs, but occasionally you may need to purchase these accessories separately. Despite their inconvenience, rechargeable flashlights are desirable because they provide more energy than similarly sized disposable batteries. As an additional benefit, some rechargeable flashlights use standard AA or AAA cells as backups.</p>"
concealed carry holsters for women,"<h2>Types of concealed carry holsters</h2><p>There are a lot of options out there when it comes to concealed carry holsters. There's no need to break the bank on a quality option, but you do want to make sure that you're getting what you pay for. Before you go shopping, here's a breakdown of some of the most common concealed carry holster types and how they work.</p><h3>Outside-the-waistband</h3><p>Outside-the-waistband (OWB) holsters are typically worn openly in a duty capacity, but it's not totally unheard of for concealed carry. The biggest benefit of OWB carry is comfort since your gun and holster aren't making direct contact with your body. The downside is you will need a cover garment that is long enough to completely cover the bottom end of the gun and holster even if you bend over or extend your arms up</p><h3>Inside-the-waistband</h3><p>An inside-the-waistband holster (IWB) holster is the most common method of concealed carry. The benefit is that it makes concealing a handgun much easier than an OWB holster because it's worn between your pants and your body, naturally concealing the gun under your normal clothes. This does trade some level of comfort, however, which is why there's less variety in holster style to accommodate the more restrictive position.</p><p>Traditionally, most people carry IWB holsters at the four or five o'clock position, but this is starting to become less common as carrying in the front over your appendix (called appendix carry) or right on the centerline of your body due to how fast your draw stroke can get with some practice. Small-of-the-back carry is another position that has gone out of style, largely discouraged because if you fall and land on the gun or have even a minor traffic accident, you could suffer a severe back injury.</p><h3>Shoulder holsters</h3><p>Shoulder holsters are the best option for some women because of their body type or they expect to be wearing dresses often. While somewhat less common in the law enforcement community than they used to be, shoulder holsters still exist and are used by undercover agents and concealed carriers alike. Holsters that keep the muzzle parallel to the ground are often preferred for smaller guns, while longer firearms can be concealed with a muzzle-down design.</p><p>The first thing to consider when using a shoulder holster is that you'll need to wear a cover garment like a jacket or loose-fitting shirt to conceal your firearm. Second, you'll also need to be able to have quick access to your firearm through the front of your garment, so having a button-up shirt completely closed won't help you at all. Lastly, muzzle discipline is extra important when drawing from a shoulder holster, as any wide sweeps will threaten anyone in the arc of your arm. Practice makes perfect here in keeping the muzzle in a safe direction while drawing.</p>"
fixed blade knives,"<h2>Types of fixed blade knives</h2><p>Fixed blade knives are simple to use. They don't require a sharpening stone or knife sharpener, and they're easy to clean up. However, there are several different types of fixed blade knives that you can choose from. Each type has its own unique set of features and uses. We'll break down the differences between them so you can make an educated decision on which one is right for you.</p><h3>Drop Point</h3><p>This is by far the most popular knife blade type and for good reason, it's the most neutral and versatile blade design you can get your hands on today. The drop-point has been around a very long time and although there are some slight variations in its design across brands, the idea is the same. The drop-point performs well in combat scenarios, under pressure in survival situations, it's an excellent camping buddy, and it's one of the easiest knife shapes to maintain.</p><h3>Tanto</h3><p>Tanto blades kill things. Happy? Okay, fine I'll explain. The Tanto blade was purposely engineered to have incredible stabbing and penetration ability. The point is extremely thin and sharp, allowing for that initial penetration and then the thicker section of the blade easily slides into whatever you're stabbing, creating massive damage and an incredibly difficult wound to heal from. Of course, we're not condoning violence and I don't suggest you use this knife on a human being, but they do make highly effective combat and self-defense options if the need arises.</p><h3>Reverse Tanto</h3><p>The reverse Tanto offers a mostly flat blade belly and a mostly flat spine all the way up until the point. On the belly, the blade remains flat all the way through, but on the spine, the tip of the blade slopes downward harshly to the point. These are pretty good for cutting in straight down motions as the tip won't interfere or cause excess drag on none-cutting surfaces, however, there are many blades that perform this action and other actions as well and that's why I don't usually love this shape for fixed blade knives.</p><h3>Clip-Point</h3><p>These are pretty similar to a drop-point but it seems as though they've gone on a diet and lost a few grams in the upper spine section. The spine, from the handle, juts out in a flat straight fashion but as we get closer to the point, a big chunk of the blade is taken out almost as if it was cut out by a fingernail snipper.</p><h3>Spear-Point</h3><p>The spear-point is pretty self-explanatory in that it's a knife blade designed to mimic the attributes you'd expect to find on a spear. Both the belly of the blade and the spine of the blade come together to form an extremely thin but sharp point that is really only good at one thing and yes, you guessed it, that's spearing!</p><h3>Straight-Back</h3><p>These are also dubbed as a standard blade and can be identified by their gentle upward slope from the belly of the blade up to the tip with a relatively shallow slope back down the spine. These blades are extremely minimal and usually quite thin with the idea of being simple and light. These are excellent knives to use when cutting away from you as the curvature of the blade allows for a very smooth movement forward.</p><h3>Hawkbill</h3><p>Although technically named the Hawkbill, these are generally more recognizable as the Karambit or Claw blades. These are blades that look like a claw and have a concave curvature to them. These blades lack versatility but do exceptionally well when cutting things towards yourself, like opening boxes, popping zip ties, or dragging your dying enemies closer to you to hear their last breath. Okay, a bit dramatic, but so is the blade shape!</p><h3>Trailing-Point</h3><p>This blade is a bit similar to the straight-back but instead of a straight-back it has a spine that curves slightly upward and brings the point up slightly with it. I know, the point of the straight-back is to be straight, so how can it be similar? Well, the belly of both blade shapes is slightly curved upwards and sometimes the curve of the spine can be so minuscule that it's easy to mistake one for the other.</p><h3>Kukri</h3><p>This is either a battle-hardened nightmare for your enemies or a top-class bushcrafter, your choice and I suppose it could be both as well. These were originally used by Asian militaries way back in the olden days but farmers and explorers quickly adopted their shape to cut through dense foliage.</p>"
charcoal grills,"<h2>Types of charcoal grills</h2><p>Charcoal grills come in two main categories: portable and stationary. Portable grills are lightweight, compact, and easy to pack. Stationary grills are heavier, larger, and more difficult to move around the campsite. Both styles have their place, but you need to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Brazier Grills</h3><p>These small, simple grills hold charcoal in shallow, open pans without lids. Metal cooking grates are fastened on top. Cooking speed is adjusted by raising or lowering the grates. Devoid of lids and venting systems, the Brazier is a straightforward version of a Kettle Grill, offering a metal pan filled with charcoals under a wire or mesh grate. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes, but are typically small, round or square grills with no covers.</p><h3>Kettle Grills</h3><p>A kettle grill can be the least expensive and smallest type of charcoal grill. It tends to have a round shape with a defined bowl to contain the coals, designed for high heat retention. It's also the most portable grill. A matching dome-shaped lid hinges open and closed on top, allowing covered or uncovered cooking. Vents on the top and bottom allow further heat adjustment. The smaller grilling surface of kettle charcoal grills makes them convenient for smaller groups and faster cooking times, but they may be less suitable for large gatherings.</p><h3>Square Grills</h3><p>A combination of Kettle grills and brazier models, square charcoal grills have replaced braziers in popularity since their introduction in the 1960s. The lid is similar to a kettle grill lid in design, with adjustable vents, and typically offers four legs, with two legs featuring wheels so the unit can be tilted and moved for storage when not in use. These models are typically devoid of extra features and options, such as baskets and hot dog shelves, but these features are sometimes offered.</p><h3>Barrel Grills</h3><p>A barrel grill, as the name suggests, has a barrel-shaped design that gives it a larger cooking area than most kettle grills, making it more suitable for large groups or grilling different types of food at once. It's also more effective for smoking and slow cooking. These are best for those who cook lots of meat at once. The simplest versions are 55-gallon barrels cut in half lengthwise, with charcoal and a cooking grate in the bottom half, and the top half functioning as a hinged lid. Barrell grills tend to be more expensive and less portable.</p><h3>Cart Grills</h3><p>Typically rectangular in design, charcoal cart grills are designed for easy use and easy mobility. The lids are attached to the base by hinges; the internal design features a grill for food and a grid for charcoal, both of which can be raised or lowered to adjust heat levels. Most models feature an ash collector drawer at the bottom for removing ashes. The carts themselves features wheels, and typically storage shelves or side trays.</p><h3>Ceramic Grills</h3><p>Also called kamado grills after a type of Japanese stove, ceramic grills usually have a familiar egg shape designed for efficient heat retention and regulation. They tend to heat up more quickly and have the flexibility for cooking and smoking many different types of food, including pizza and paella. They can be the most expensive type of grills, but are also highly durable and weather resistant. They vary in size, but the ceramic walls make even the smaller ones relatively heavy and not easily portable.</p>"
aviation watches,"<h2>Types of aviation watches</h2><p>There are two main categories of aviation watches: those that are specifically designed for flying and those that can be worn on land. The former includes watches with built-in altimeters, compasses, and other features designed for flight use. The latter includes watches with basic timekeeping capabilities but also watches with additional features like chronographs, stopwatches, lap timers, and countdown clocks.</p><p>Aviation watches can take many forms: big, small, military or civilian in origin, a bold and spartan dial or a captivatingly busy chronograph... But what they share in common is a focused purpose and a connection to the endlessly compelling idea of flight.</p><p>Aviation watches fall into four major categories: type A Fliegers, type B Fliegers, chronographs, and navitimers. These all have rich histories within the fields of aviation, and many watches on this list straddle two different categories in their design language.</p><h3>Type A Flieger</h3><p>Type A Fliegers are simple three-hand pilots watches that feature a high-contrast dark dial with white arabic numerals and an outer minute track. They are essentially standard three-hand watches that prioritize readability above all else, and therefore have very simple dials.</p><h3>Type B Flieger</h3><p>Type B Fliegers feature large outer minute tracks and small inner hour tracks due to the fact that many pilots felt that knowing what minute of the hour was more important than knowing the hour of the day. Well-designed type B Fliegers will have the hour hand be just long enough to reach the inner hour track, and the minute hand long enough to reach the large minute track.</p><h3>Chronograph</h3><p>A Flyback Chronograph is a pilot's necessity because it saves time while recording several different timings in a row.</p><p>The beautifully hand-finished watch not only includes a manually-actuated slide rule bezel, but also a fully-functional chronograph that tracks hours, minutes, and seconds as a nod to a time when pilots flying by instrument had to plot waypoints on a map, estimate time of flight based off airspeed, and then have a stopwatch running to let them know when to turn.</p><h3>Navitimer</h3><p>Navitimers mean any watch that seeks to be a suite of aeronautical instruments on the wearer's wrist, featuring things like compass bezels, slide rules, dual-time functions, and so forth. These are the most complex watches on this list, and are some of the most complex on the market.</p>"
butterfly knives,"<h2>Types of butterfly knives</h2><h3>Construction</h3><p>Expert bladesmiths construct these blades through two different methods, known as sandwich construction and channel construction.</p><ul><li>Sandwich construction means that the handles of the butterfly are made up of layers that are connected with screws, pins, or spacers. In other words, the handles are not made up of one solid piece of material</li><li>Channel construction means that each of the handles on the butterfly knife is constructed from a single, solid piece of material. With this type of construction, the blade typically sits within the grooves of the handle when the knife is closed.</li></ul><p>A lot of them seem to do almost the exact same thing with much of the differences being more subjective rather than objective. Even so, there are some knives, however, that are able to take care of certain jobs just a little bit better than others. Here are a few disciplines through which a balisong can distinguish itself.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>Balisongs favoring EDC duty may stand out with big, utilitarian blades or an overall compact design that's friendly on the pocket. Nearly all of them would have built-in pocket clips for ease of transport. Those with spring-loaded latches are easier to deploy and safer to secure on a regular basis until needed. Such knives will often feature the most robust, corrosion-resistant, and dependable build quality to ensure a long life.</p><h3>Self-defense</h3><p>Knives that best suit this category will often be the sharpest of flippers, typically larger spear points or bayonet-types, constructed with durable blade materials that can take a beating. Nicer examples may also feature spring-loaded latches for easier, quicker deployment in tense situations as well as pocket clips to aid in EDC duty.</p><h3>Trainers</h3><p>As per the name, trainers are literally intended to train enthusiasts how to properly deploy and flip their butterfly knives with minimal risk of injury. They'll be constructed under the same standards and build quality as the real thing and often using the same materials. Some high-end trainers may even use ball bearing pivots just like more premium butterfly knives. All trainers will feature the same common trait: a dull, rounded-off edge all the way around the blade eliminating the risk of cutting one's self.</p><h3>Novelty</h3><p>Cheap, decorative knives with a priority on form over function may also fall under this category, knives constructed of cheap steel and wrapped in fancy pearlescent colors and such. You wouldn't use them to carve wood. You probably wouldn't think to use one for opening mail. But they definitely look pretty up on a shelf.</p>"
heat lamps,"<h2>Types of heat lamps</h2><p>When the temperatures drop and a chill is in the air, having a source of outdoor heat will make outdoor activities more enjoyable. Patio heaters are well suited to northern climates, where the mercury plunges as soon as the summer sun drops beneath the horizon. They're also beneficial in warmer regions, day or night, during the winter months. When shopping for the best outdoor heater, you have several options for the type of power required to operate the unit.</p><h3>Propane</h3><p>Propane patio heaters can warm up spaces quickly. Some are quite large and will hold up to a 20-gallon propane tank boon when you wish to heat a large area for an extended period. These outdoor heaters are often portable, depending on the style, and many include wheels.</p><p>Due to the risk of carbon monoxide buildup, don't use exterior propane heaters in an enclosed area, such as a greenhouse or enclosed patio, unless a clear safety feature is built into the unit to prevent operation under insufficient oxygen levels.</p><h3>Natural Gas</h3><p>Gas heaters fueled by natural gas are more likely to be considered permanent fixtures on the patio than propane heaters because they connect to a home's natural gas line. Depending on local building codes, running a natural gas line to the patio probably requires the services of a licensed plumber.</p><p>The upside to a natural gas patio heater is a lower operating cost because natural gas is usually a less expensive power source than propane. If you're looking for a reliable source of patio heat, a natural gas heater could be a cost-effective way to entertain outdoors, even during cool weather.</p><h3>Electric</h3><p>There's no need to buy fuel for electric patio heaters, but plan to replace the heating lamps occasionally. With no open flame, electric heaters may be safer than other types for some families both indoors and out. But they are usually smaller and not as powerful, so an electric patio heater may not generate as much heat as its propane cousin.</p><p>When shopping for an electric patio heater, compare the heat output of different models, but keep in mind that a higher heat output means increased electricity usage and a larger electric bill. Also, remember that the best electric patio heater includes a power cord, so it's necessary to have at least one outdoor electrical outlet.</p><h3>Wood</h3><p>For an authentic campfire feel, there's nothing quite like a wood-burning patio heater. This type of heater can generate a lot of heat, depending on the size of the firebox and the amount of wood it will hold.</p><p>Since wood fires can create smoke and ash, a wood-burning patio heater isn't suitable for an enclosed patio. To reduce smoke, burn only seasoned hardwoods, such as hickory, birch, and white ash. Some communities don't permit open firepits, so check with your local fire department before buying one.</p>"
hunting blinds,"<h2>Hunting Blind Types</h2><p>Whether you want a portable or permanent hunting blind is a personal decision, but there are benefits and considerations for both options.</p><h3>Permanent</h3><p>Permanent hunting blinds usually consist of a floor, four walls, and a roof built into a site you designate beforehand. They're great for big game hunters who already have a location in mind, but they might not be ideal for someone who needs a bit of flexibility to move about.</p><h3>Portable</h3><p>Portable hunting blinds come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but they're all designed to be brought out into the field and set up quickly. They're popular choices for novice hunters who might not know exactly what kind of view they want, or for those who want to switch out blinds depending on the day or the game they are hunting.</p><h3>Ground blinds</h3><p>These blinds are placed directly on the dirt or grass. Because they do not require a tree or an elevating structure to mount it on, they are easier to move when needed. The lack of a ladder or stairs also means that hunters with reduced mobility can access ground blinds more comfortably, reducing injury risk. When shooting from ground level, the kill zones are as broad as possible, offering a wider area for clean shots. But they must be camouflaged or placed in advance to give animals time to get used to the new structure.</p><h3>Elevated blinds</h3><p>These blinds are mounted to trees or onto lumber structures, typically mounted 5 to 10 feet over the ground. The elevation grants several advantages. You can see farther into the distance, and you are shooting at a downward angle, minimizing any safety issues if you miss. You can also keep every window open, maximizing your field of view. When shooting from an elevated position, the kill zone is smaller, requiring more precision to make a clean and humane shot. You also have virtually no protection from the wind, which can carry your scent toward the deer, alerting the animals to your presence.</p><h3>Duck or Goose Blinds</h3><p>Waterfowl blinds are a specialized type of blind that is used to conceal the hunter from waterfowl while hunting. They are typically made of plywood or other man-made materials, and may be placed on land or in water, and often has a decoy spread out in front of it.</p><p>There are many types of duck blinds that overlap with traditional hunting blinds, these include ground blinds that are low profile, camouflaged structures that conceal the hunter from the game.</p>"
bug out bags,"<h2>Types of bug-out bags</h2><p>Bug-out bags are designed to be compact and portable. They're meant for quick getaways, so they need to hold up against rough handling. That's why most of them use cloth or nylon webbing to close the bag. The downside is that these materials tend to rip easily, so you'll have to pay attention when you pack it. If you plan on using a bug-out bag in an emergency situation, it's worth spending a little extra money to get something made from tougher material.</p><h3>Clip-on bags</h3><p>These are the simplest option available. They're meant for small items like keys or cash. You can find clip-on bug-out bags at places like Walmart or Target for under $20. These are great options if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a bag. Just make sure you buy one with a good seal. These tend to be cheaper because they're made from thinner material. It's important to keep these bags closed when you store them, since they can leak easily. If you don't do this, you could end up with a bag full of water damage.</p><h3>Sling bags</h3><p>These are another option for smaller items like cash or keys. They're meant to be carried by hand, so they need to be lightweight. Most sling bags weigh less than five pounds. This makes them a great option for bug-out bags. They're also easy to carry by the handle, so you can just sling it over your shoulder. The downside is that they're not very durable. They're made from thin material, so they tend to tear easily. If you plan on using a sling bag in an emergency situation, it's worth spending a little more money to get something made from tougher material.</p><h3>Tactical backpack Vs. Hiking backpack</h3><p>The two main options for a BOB are a tactical backpack and a hiking backpack. While a tactical backpack may be more practical, a hiking backpack is less conspicuous when bugging out. If you live in a heavily populated area during an emergency and you look like you know what you're doing, you may be targeted by others who unprepared. Carrying a tactical backpack could be a visual clue that you'd rather not provide.</p>"
kerosene heaters,"<h2>Types of kerosene heaters</h2><p>There are several types of portable kerosene heaters:</p><h3>The Convective Kerosene Heater</h3><p>It is usually circular in shape. Its fuel tank is located below the wick and combustion chamber.The wick absorbs and delivers fuel to the combustion chamber. Convective heaters circulate warm air upward and outward in all directions. They're designed for large areas or even several rooms, but never for a small, closed area such as a bedroom.</p><h3>Radiant Kerosene Heater</h3><p>It is usually rectangular in shape - are designed for smaller areas. They also feature a wick and combustion chamber and have, in addition, a reflector which directs heat at people or objects. Some radiant heaters have electric fans to increase the flow of warm air.</p><p>Many - but not all - radiant models have a removable fuel tank, which means that the heater can stay in place. Only the fuel tank needs to be carried to where the fuel is stored.</p><h3>Traditional Kerosene Heater</h3><p>This is the simplest option, but it is not the best. It is cheap, reliable, and easy to use with no advanced features. It is also inefficient, so you'll need to spend more money to get better performance. If you want more options, you'll need to move up to a higher-end option.</p><h3>Gas Kerosene Heater</h3><p>This is the most advanced option, so you should consider them if you want more options. Gas heater is expensive, but it is worth it if you want to upgrade. It is safe to use around children and pets because it does not produce sparks or hot flames. It also has advanced features like adjustable settings for different temperatures. You can choose from two different types of gas heaters. One uses propane as fuel, and the other uses natural gas. Both are safe to use around children and pets, but propane heaters are the safest option.</p>"
hidden gun safes,"<h2>Types of hidden gun safes</h2><p>There are two main categories for hidden gun safes. The first is whether they're accessible from the outside or not, and the second is how secure they are.</p><h4>Freestanding vs. Installed</h4><p>The most convenient hidden gun safes are freestanding, meaning there's no installation required. Safes designed as furniture, picture frames, or clocks can be placed in your home and immediately put to use. You can reposition them easily and take them with you when you move. Size is the biggest limitation of this style. Coffee tables and some wall art may be able to accommodate something like an AR pistol, but most are designed for full-size handguns or smaller.</p><p>If you're open to performing a little home renovation, you can get some really creative hidden gun safes. Some of our favorites are designed to be built into a wall between studs, then covered with a hinged or sliding mirror. These are well-hidden and large enough to accommodate long guns. The downside is the need to modify your home's walls and repair the hole in the event you move. If you opt for this style, a good wall scanner can help you locate studs, wiring, and plumbing before opening up your walls.</p><h3>The Tactical Traps End Table</h3><p>One of the most common places people store their guns is next to their bed. This end table offers bedside convenience with an extra layer of security. The storage compartment fits under the surface of the end table, where a drawer would normally be found. Its foam padding protects your firearm's finish and keeps it secure and stable if you have to move the table.</p><h3>Lockdown In Plain Sight Shelf</h3><p>One of the advantages hidden gun safes enjoy over traditional safes is the ability to be built at much lower costs - hiding something is much easier than fending off crowbars and angle grinders. This shelf from Lockdown offers terrific value for budget-minded shoppers and it's versatile enough to protect other kinds of valuables, too.</p><h3>V-Line Tactical Closet Vault</h3><p>Its metal construction, mechanical lock, and cavernous interior are ideal for anyone interested in a more permanent gun safe for their home. Installing this safe is more of an undertaking than other kinds of hidden gun safes require. You'll need to remove a portion of your wall, making sure to avoid plumbing and electrical wiring. The good news is that this safe is sized to fit between standard studs that are spaced at 16 inches on center.</p><h3>Tactical Walls</h3><p>This hidden gun safe is the most expensive option on this list (depending on the options you choose), but it also includes everything you need to stash long guns and plenty of extra gear inside the walls of your home for safekeeping.</p>"
pepper sprays,"<h2>Types of Pepper Sprays</h2><h3>Self-defense pepper spray</h3><p>Pepper spray designed for self-defense typically comes in small, single-use containers that can be carried on a keychain or in your pocket. This style of pepper spray is inexpensive, easy to use, and extremely effective. Chemical irritants impede a would-be attackers vision and cause intense temporary pain. Those of you who have trained in a gas chamber know the feeling. If you're looking for a portable, discrete self-defense option, it doesn't get much better than this.</p><h3>Wildlife-deterrent pepper spray</h3><p>Firearms have long been the gold standard in wilderness self-defense. That makes sense, especially for hunters who are armed anyway. Surprisingly, though, many predator attacks can be stopped more effectively with pepper spray than with a firearm. First of all, animals like bears and mountain lions are tough targets. They're big, fast, and relentless fighters. No matter how good of a shot you are or what you're armed with, that's not a good situation to be in. You're better off using the skun's strategy and just making them want to leave on their own terms.</p><h3>Aerosolized pepper spray</h3><p>The most common form of pepper spray is the aerosolized variety. These products come in handheld cans with compressed air that creates a strong, directional mist of chemical irritants. You don't have to worry too much about aim, and there's very little skill required. High winds can affect this kind of pepper spray, so some manufacturers have switched to gel alternatives that are less likely to be blown off-target or affect you as you defend yourself. Both are mainstays of nonlethal self-defense, and should be among the first things you consider when shopping for personal protection measures.</p><h3>Pepper ball launchers</h3><p>Self-defense chemical irritants can also be delivered as a fragile ball that breaks on impact, releasing a concentrated dose of pepper spray on and around the target itself. Launchers are small, handheld devices that are powered by compressed air. Some are effective at ranges of more than 50 feet, giving you plenty of standoff distance. This delivery method is less susceptible to wind than traditional pepper spray and allows you to refill the launcher after use.</p>"
multitools,"<h2>Types of Multitools</h2><p>There are two main types of multi-tools. Those small enough to fit into a pocket or fasten to a keychain, and those full-size models that fit into a pocket or purse.</p><h3>Large Multitools</h3><p>If you expect to put your multi-tool to heavy use, a full-size model is probably your best choice, as the included tools are obviously larger and often sturdier to withstand more force.</p><h3>Small Multitools</h3><p>But a keychain multi-tool is undeniably handy for those quick and simple tasks that arise throughout the day. Ultimately, the best type is a matter of preference. Some people even choose to have both.</p>"
holsters for sig p365,"<h2>Types of holsters</h2><p>The SIG Sauer P365 is the go-to firearm for concealed-carry fans who need an extremely small handgun with lots of capacity. Consequently, SIG users have been crying out for new holster models, and holster makers have responded accordingly. However, some of the best SIG P365 holsters are relatively new to the market, so lots of owners are not aware of the excellent choice currently available.</p><h3>Concealment Express</h3><p>These holders might be worth the risk on the price alone. It isn't designed for a single concealment carry position like so many holsters; You can wear it in multiple locations.</p><p>It was constructed to perfectly fit a SIG P365, but it fits any pistol that has the same size and design regardless of the caliber. Durability is the key to this design as there aren't many moving parts, so it should take a long time before any deterioration is noticeable.</p><h3>Alien Gear ShapeShift</h3><p>Some older Alien Gear holsters used to get a bad rap for lacking ruggedness and durability, but the newer models have fixed those issues.</p><p>Some older Alien Gear holsters used to get a bad rap for lacking ruggedness and durability, but the newer models have fixed those issues. This is a product whose popularity will continue to grow year on year. The affordable price in combination with the comfort, durability, and multiple position options is impressive.</p><h3>CrossBreed Holsters</h3><p>CrossBreed Holsters is one of the newer names in (2005) tactical gear companies on the market. It uses a combination of Kydex with high-end, durable leather.</p><p>You can strap this holster with a large gun belt, and it fits exactly as you expect it to. It's also the type of holster that gets more comfortable and conforms to your body over time. It stands up to the rigors of constant re-drawing and re-holstering, but the leather can get soaked and takes considerable time to dry. It also seems to absorb too much sweat, which is sometimes an issue with leather holsters.</p><h3>Tulster Holsters</h3><p>If you use your firearm in warm and hot climates, this holster should suit you. An undersized sweat shield is molded into the holster that alleviates any potential skin irritations due to heat.</p><p>Tulster has constructed a holster that has numerous features and immense attention to detail. And for this price, it's an absolute steal. It's safe, comfortable, well-built, and durable.</p><h3>Fierce Defender</h3><p>It comes highly recommended by law enforcement officers, and it was easy to see why. It is well designed and very effective; it's made in the USA and was ideally designed with experienced CCW users in mind.</p><p>It's an excellent value for money IWB holster that combines comfort with a nice design and practicality. If you CCW all day long, this might be the best option on your list.</p><h3>DeSantis Thumb Break Sig</h3><p>It is a top-notch model from a company that has spent decades making fine leather holsters. The versatile draw angles are a massive advantage with this high-riding design and are comfortable to wear while sitting.</p><h3>Relentless Tactical Defender</h3><p>This model is not ambidextrous, but it is available to buy separately in both left and right-handed styles. The Defender has a reinforced top which helps to maintain shape when drawn. This solidity makes it very easy to re-holster without any fuss or scrambling about.</p><p>However, one of the main drawbacks for me is the lack of retention features. There's no strap that slows down your draw, so your pistol safety largely depends upon pressure from your waistband.</p>"
gps watch,"<h2>Types of GPS watches</h2><p>It's good to keep in mind that there are a variety of options out there to pick out the best GPS watch for you. Which GPS watch you choose will depend on how you plan on using it.</p><h3>Running watch</h3><p>These models often cater to runners and include an accelerometer so that you can get information on indoor runs.</p><h3>A cycling GPS</h3><p>It will give you the option to track your rides specifically, will have a longer battery life than other GPS watches for long rides, may have music options, and might even have turn-by-turn directions.</p><h3>Swimming GPS</h3><p>These watches are swim-centric and focus mainly on your pool workouts. They are completely waterproof, unlike some other watches. And you have a variety of options for swimming watches. Some are simple and just count laps. Others have more advanced features, including other sports options.</p><h3>Triathlon</h3><p>Some watches have running, swimming, and cycling modes that you can rotate between. These are great options for triathletes because they have all their information in one location and can easily switch between bicycles without having to move a bike computer. A true triathlon watch will also track your transition times, a key bit of data for the competitive multi-sport athlete.</p><h3>Golf GPS watch</h3><p>If you're really into golf, a golf GPS watch will give you an excellent view of the hole you're on, allowing you to know how to get to the green and make you aware of any hazards in the way. It will give you a birds-eye view of what's going on in your game.</p><h3>Diving watches</h3><p>GPS signals are not as accurate under water, so diving watches are designed to account for this by using GPS gateways often found in buoys.</p><p>They are going to be waterproof to a significant depth, give you a map of where you are, allow you to mark interesting places, and communicate with other divers with diving GPS watches by sending air pressure and SOS signals.</p>"
portable coffee makers,"<h2>Types of Portable Coffee Makers</h2><p>Coffee makers generally come in four types based on the brewing process they use. There are brewers that use pressure, brewers that use steeping, brewers that use filtration or dripping, and brewers that boil.</p><h3>Pressure brewers</h3><p>The four most common devices that brew under pressure are countertop espresso machines, countertop automatic coffee machines, the more portable Moka Pot, and AeroPress. These devices use fine- to medium-ground coffee and brew fast - between one and five minutes from start to finish.</p><h3>Steeping brewers</h3><p>The four most common steeping brewers are the French press, the Siphon (which looks like something out of Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory), the coffee bag (yuck!), and the soft brew. These methods use a more chunky medium to medium-fine grind (except the coffee bag which uses ultra-fine), and take a bit longer to extract the flavor from the coffee - about four to eight minutes.</p><h3>Filtration brewers</h3>The five most common filter brewers are the auto-drip, the pour-over, the drip filter, the percolator, and the cold drip (which again looks like some freaky chemistry set). These methods use medium - to coarse-ground coffee and take about four to 10 minutes to brew - or 10 to 24 hours for the cold drip.</p><h3>Boiling brewers</h3><p>There are two essential types of boiling brewers, the Turkish pot, and the Cowboy method - which is just throwing grounds in a pot, boiling it, and waiting for the grounds to settle. These are fairly quick methods that use very fine (Turkish) or super chunky (Cowboy) grinds and produce coffee in one to six minutes.</p>"
bushcraft knives,"<h2>Types of Bushcraft Knives</h2><p>There is a lot of confusion online over what the best type of bushcraft knife is, how many knives you should bring with you, what length should your blade be, etc.These are common questions. Surely we all know there are many types of bushcraft knives out there, some serve purposes others don't.</p><p>Some are bigger than others, some even fold whereas others are full tang. The question is, how many knives do you need for bushcraft?</p><p>You need at least three knives for bushcraft:</p><ul><li>A 6-inch blade for wood processing and shelter construction.</li><li>A 4.3-inch blade for making bow drill kits, feather sticks, and other carving tasks.</li><li>A folding knife for butchering.</li></ul><p>The first thing that you must know is how many types of knives are available. The following are some of the main types of knives that are mostly used in bushcraft situations.</p><h3>Full-Tang Knives</h3><p>Full-tang knives are essentially made out of solid steel or stainless steel with a long wooden handle. Since these knives have no blade guard, they can cause serious injury if not held properly.</p><p>You should always hold the knife firmly when cutting into the wood to avoid slipping as well as use it as a screwdriver and to hit hard objects like nails.</p><h3>Dagger Knives</h3><p>Dagger knives, also known as ''skinning knives'' have a short tang which is about at least 3/4th the length of a full-tang knife. Most dagger knives were traditionally designed for skinning animals but nowadays they are used for bushcraft activities such as hunting game birds, fish, edible plants, etc.</p><h3>Spear Knives</h3><p>Spear knives are the smallest category among all bushcraft knives and are usually used for small tasks such as opening tin cans and boxes or digging holes. These knives are relatively light and handy.</p><p>This makes them perfect for carrying around whilst bushcrafting. Even though they are very handy, they are not recommended for bigger tasks due to their limited strength and sharpness.</p><p>As they do not have any extra features like serrations on the edge of the blade, they cannot be used for self-defense purposes.</p><p>It should also be noted that most spear knives are poorly made blades that will easily break after being dropped or stepped on.</p><h3>Fixed-Blade Knives</h3><p>Fixed-blades are the most powerful among all bushcraft knives. They are heavy and bulky compared to the other types of knives because of the addition of a steel handle.</p><p>When using fixed-blades, it is highly recommended to wear leather gloves to prevent getting hurt during your training sessions.</p><h3>Hunting Knife Sets</h3><p>Hunting knife sets are basically used for hunting big mammals such as deer and elk. These knives include two separate blades, one longer than the other so that each person has his own blade. This design allows the hunter to quickly switch between the two blades.</p><h3>Folding Knives</h3><p>These knives fold up into a compact size and hence make them ideal for hiking and camping trips. You must remember to carry this type of bushcraft knife with care once you reach your destination since they are easy to lose or drop when walking through rough terrains.</p>"
backpacking water filters,"<h3>Types Of Backpacking Water Filters</h3><h3>Squeeze</h3><p>Squeeze filters are made from hollow fiber membranes and are most often paired with a soft bag or flask that you fill with dirty water. Then, you squeeze the water through the filter into a clean bottle or reservoir, your cookpot, or directly into your mouth. These filters tend to be lightweight, inexpensive, and have no mechanical parts to worry about. They do, however, tend to have a decreased flow rate over time which, with certain filters, can be partially addressed by backflushing. Pre-filtering water that is cloudy or contains sediment using a bandana or buff can help prevent the decrease in flow rates.</p><h3>Gravity</h3><p>Gravity filters use, well, gravity to pull water from a dirty reservoir bag hung on a tree (or held up high) through a hollow fiber filter and into either a clean reservoir or bottle. These filter systems tend to be a bit heavier than squeeze systems due to the reservoirs, hanging straps, and tubes, but they are a great way to filter a lot of water with minimal effort and are an excellent option for groups or base camping.</p><h3>Pumps</h3><p>Pump-style filters use a hand pump to force water through a hollow or glass fiber filter. A hose, many of which have a pre-filter attached, is dropped into the water source and then you hand pump until you have all the water you need. Unlike the other filtration systems, this one requires you to remain at the water source for the duration of the time it takes you to filter. Pumps are also heavier than other filter systems.</p><h3>UV Light</h3><p>UV light purifiers use a UV bulb to destroy the DNA/RNA of bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, making them unable to reproduce and in effect, killing them. It is critical to pre-filter your water using a bandana or buff so there are no particles in the water. If a virus or bacteria is hanging out on the backside of a floatie, the UV light won't hit it and it will be allowed to reproduce freely. While lightweight, UV purifiers rely on batteries (either replaceable or USB rechargeable), which should be taken into consideration.</p><h3>Chemical</h3><p>Chemical purifiers contain chlorine dioxide, which, given enough time, destroy bacteria, protozoa, and viruses. Iodine is another chemical treatment available, but it does not kill all protozoa (namely Cryptosporidium). Chemical treatments are usually used as backups, though some opt to use them for their primary treatment method.</p><p>Based on your activity, you might choose a different water filter. For example; a fast packer who is looking to shed the most ounces is going to make a different choice than somebody who is car camping where weight doesn't matter the most. Below, we outline some activities and provide some recommendations.</p><h3>Backpacking</h3><p>Given that you are carrying everything with you, you will want to consider the weight and packability of all your items. For example; thru-hikers that are taking on 1000's of miles may opt to go with a super lightweight chemical treatment that can kill most things.</p><p>However, if you're just out for a few days and you're traveling with a large group, you can split the water filtration system that weighs a few more ounces. In that case, you may want to consider a highly efficient and fast filtration system.</p><h3>Fastpacking or Trail Running</h3><p>It's all about going light. In this case, we'd choose the lightest and safest options out there. Chemical treatment is a great option here. However, it doesn't yield water quickly, requiring about a half-hour of waiting time. On-the-go filtrations units offer better durability and filter water instantly. Look for those with interchangeable bottles, so you can choose which one you want to squeeze to get water and hold in your hand or hydration vest.</p><h3>Bikepacking</h3><p>If you like your current bottle while biking, there are adaptor kits out there that can fit the bottles you love best. These turn your bottle into a filtration system. They are super lightweight and easy to pack about.</p><h3>International Travel</h3><p>Be sure to carry a purification system or chemical treatment when traveling abroad. Since viruses abound in these areas, it's essential to be protected from them.</p>"
mosquito repellents,"<h2>Types of Mosquito Repellents</h2><p>Here are the main types of insect repellents for your skin:</p><ul><li>DEET: It's considered the gold standard in terms of its effectiveness. It's been used and studied more than any other repellent in human history, though it must be handled carefully because it can damage plastics (think sunglasses, trekking pole grips, etc.)</li><li>Picaridin: Though it's been around for fewer decades, its efficacy is considered comparable to DEET for mosquitoes and ticks, and it works better on flies. Picaridin also has minimal odor and no damaging effect on plastics and other synthetics.</li><li>Synthesized Plant Oils (mosquitoes, some ticks): These synthesized plant oils are still considered chemicals and are regulated by the EPA for use on humans.</li></ul><h3>Broad Spectrum vs. Narrow Spectrum</h3><p>Broad spectrum repellents are designed to deter both blood-seeking mosquitoes and other insects. Narrow spectrum repellents are designed to deter specific types of insects, such as only blood-seeking mosquitoes.</p><p>Blood-seeking mosquitoes have special structures inside their nose known as sensilla that absorb water and then release it into the air when the mosquito breathes out. These sensilla do not function properly in cold temperatures, which is why narrow-spectrum repellents that operate via this mechanism only deter these mosquitoes in warm weather.</p><p>Other types of insects that broad-spectrum repellents might deter include ants, gnats, fleas, and other small flying insects. Because these repellents also deter beneficial insects, they are less desirable.</p><p>Insect repellents applied to the skin are often what we think of when we want to avoid insect bites. These are the most broadly useful, since they stay with you regardless of your movements. Other types of repellents that EPA registers include:</p><ul><li>Clip-on products that have a pad with the repellent and a fan or other mechanism that disperses the repellent near your body.</li><li>Spatial repellents use a heating mechanism to disperse repellent in an outdoor area.</li></ul><p>Note that both stationary and wearable spatial repellents are for outdoor use only, unless the label specifically states they can be used indoors.</p><h3>Airborne Insect Repellents</h3><p>When you're staying in one general area, such as hanging around your campsite, you can use special dispersal devices to release a chemical that creates a zone of mosquito-free airspace. Protection lasts as long as the device is fueled up and turned on. This is nice because there's no messing with skin application and mosquitoes are kept far away.</p><h3>Insect-Repellent Clothing</h3><p>Mosquito- and tick-repellent clothing uses this synthetic chemical that acts like a natural extract from chrysanthemums and kills insects that come into contact with it. You can buy clothing that's been pretreated with it or you can spray it onto clothing to stop mosquitoes from biting through and ticks from crawling across.</p><h3>Wristbands</h3><div><p>These wearable repellent devices are marketed as being safer because you don't have to rub anything on your skin.</p><p>But scientists who have tested these products have found them to be ineffective. It's not that they don't contain mosquito repellents but wearing a bracelet to protect your whole body from mosquitoes is just not enough.</p><h3>Clip-On Foggers</h3><p>Fogging is a quick fix way to get your yard somewhat bug free. It's great if you are hosting a party or event in your yard but not for long term use. Fogging sprays a chemical into the grass and surrounding areas making the mosquitos currently there die. This does not account for the mosquito larvae and other bugs</p><h3>Sonic Repellents</h3><div><p>Ultrasonic devices are claimed to emit high-frequency sounds that are too high for humans to hear but are just the right frequency to drive pests, including mosquitoes, away. The trouble is, there's no proof that they work.</p><h3>Citronella Candles</h3><p>Despite the popularity of citronella candles as an area repellent, there's little evidence that they'll provide solid protection against mosquito bites.</p></div></div>"
ankle holsters,"<h2>Types of ankle holsters</h2><p>Ankle holsters come in two categories: slip-on and strap-on. What distinguishes one from the other are the materials used to make them as well as their design. So let's take a closer look at them.</p><h3>Slip-On</h3><p>Slip-on ankle holsters usually have neoprene as the main base. The holster is then attached to the neoprene base, resulting in the final, flexible ankle holster. However, these types of ankle holsters require a calf strap to hold the holster in place, else they'll only be suitable for shorter walks.</p><p>The best slip-on holsters use breathable neoprene brands and moisture-wicking lining to make them comfortable to be worn for hours at a time. Because these kinds of holsters are much less costly to manufacture, they're great for people who are on a budget.</p><h3>Strap-On</h3><p>These types of ankle holsters employ single or multiple straps to keep them secured. The straps usually have a hook and loop design to them, making it easy for you to put them on or take them off without needing to first take your shoes off.</p><p>Additionally, strap-on holsters give you more control over the holster's fit, letting you adjust the tension to suit your comfort and concealability needs.</p>"
camping tents,"<h2>Types of Tent</h2><p>Tents come in all shapes and sizes. Use the links below to explore some of the benefits and disadvantages of each.</p><h3>The basic ridge tent</h3><p>Ridge tents are remarkably stable and range from tiny one-person tents right up to large marquees.They are easy to pitch and still make excellent shelters today.</p><p>Their main disadvantage is in head height and even in the largest units there's limited height in most of the tent. This doesn't matter when you're using the tent purely for sleeping, but makes it less than ideal for a family holiday in the rain if you can't walk around inside.</p><h3>Dome tent</h3><p>The basic shape bends a flexible pole into a half circle with both ends fixed to a strong tape or webbing strap running across the base of the tent, often as part of the groundsheet.</p><p>The term geodesic is a mathematical one. Originally a geodesic was the shortest route between two points on earth. Nowadays, it's used to describe a tent where the poles criss-cross over the surface, intersecting to form triangles. This distributes the stress across the structure, making it the most stable type of tent for extreme weather conditions. If you climb Everest, chances are that you will want to take a geodesic tent with you.</p><p>Semi-geodesic tents use similar principles but generally fewer poles for slightly less extreme conditions. Nevertheless, they are still normally produced in small sizes for those who are likely to pitch them on mountains or in windy, exposed terrain.</p><h3>Instant or quick-pitch tents</h3><p>Instant tents are made by a number of suppliers and are the latest in a range of tents that almost pitch themselves.</p><p>A long, coiled, sprung frame is permanently fitted into the fabric of the tent. By twisting the frame, the tent becomes a circular package.</p><p>A short time ago we'd have said that these tents were really only suitable for good weather conditions, but recent developments have made some much more robust and complete with inner tents and sleeping space for as many as five people.</p><p>However, many are still best kept for a night or two at a festival or for the children to put up themselves while you put up the main family tent.</p><h3>Inflatable tents</h3><p>Inflatable-tube tents have made big inroads in to the market in recent years. They are quick to pitch but can have their disadvantages.</p><p>One is that the frame and the fabric come in one package. In a poled tent you can separate out the poles and move them separately. With air tubes you need to move the whole tent in one go, which can be quite heavy.</p><p>Inflatable-tube tents often use better quality materials than their poled equivalents, making them heavier and more costly. Nevertheless, they are proving very popular with campers because they can be pitched so swiftly.</p><h3>The knuckle-jointed system</h3><p>The system is based on a simple sprung knuckle or elbow joint. This can hold a flexible pole straight or be broken to let the pole bend. The tent skeleton is permanently fitted to the fabric and putting the tent up is as simple as getting it out of its bag and letting the poles fall into the right position, similar to opening an umbrella. Working round the tent, the poles are straightened using elbow joints to allow the tent to adopt its final shape. Just be careful not to pinch your finger.</p><h3>Tunnel tents</h3><p>Domes don't necessarily give the largest amount of useable space, so another way of using flexible poles is to bind them into semi-circles and stand them up in a line to create a tunnel tent. Other tunnels use sturdy, rigid poles to form their structure.</p><p>Tunnels come in a huge variety of sizes and styles and are perhaps the most common form of family tents found on campsites today.</p><h3>Vis-a-vis</h3><p>Once domes and tunnels started to grow, tent designers added extra rooms to the basic structure</p><p>The trend started in France where a large central part of the tent would offer standing headroom, and an annexe room off each side would offer two sleeping compartments. These two compartments faced one another. They were face to face, hence the French description vis-a-vis. Vis-a-vis tents can be domes or tunnels and indeed, some of the first were square frame tents.</p><h3>Pod living</h3><p>Some of the largest tents on the market these days are pod-style. They have a central living area with several sleeping areas eading off, like spokes from the hub of a wheel.</p><p>These tents look great in the showroom. In the family setting, children can have their own spaces with good air gaps between and everyone can congregate at the heart of the tent during the day.</p><p>However, there are some disadvantages to this style of tent. Apart from the fact that they cover an enormous ground area, many campsites charge extra for such a large footprint, if they allow them on site at all they also include a larger volume of fabric than an equivalent tunnel tent, making them heavier to transport and generally more challenging to pitch.</p><h3>Large family tents</h3><p>Tent designers are coming up with ever more complex designs and scaling up their favourite small tent shapes into bigger family ones.</p><p>Scaling up is not always a good idea - not all designs work as well in differing sizes and some very unstable giant domes have been produced.</p><p>Generally speaking, tunnels work better in bigger sizes but they can act effectively as kites if the wind catches them before they are properly pegged out.</p><h3>Frame tents</h3><p>The flexible pole hasn't done away with the traditional rigid frame tents - these still exist, though they are few and far between.</p><p>They use a rigid framework of straight poles (usually steel) with angled joints and can still offer lots of space including good headroom, plus stability when properly pitched. On the down side, frame tents tend to be heavier and take somewhat longer to put up than other tents.</p>"
cabin tents,"<h2>Types of Cabin Tents</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Cabin tents are more commonly known as safari tents. They're somewhere between a cabin and a tent; they offer all the comfort and convenience of a traditional cabin, yet they provide a sleeping under the stars experience like a tent.</p><p>This is like your dome tent's dad, in that it's made in a similar fashion, just with longer, stronger rods and (usually) heavier fabrics. Compared to normal camping tents, cabin tents are much more upright and provide more space</p><p>Cabin tents also differ from one another in their intended length of stay. Most are designed for short-term use. Others are much more robust and can be used year-round; just remember that setting them up is quite a task.</p><p>Here are the 4 different types of traditional tents:</p><ul><li>A-Frame tents</li><li>Pyramid tents</li><li>Hoop tents</li><li>Dome tents</li></ul><h3>Hammock</h3><p>Camping hammocks are designed with portability and outdoor use in mind. They differ from the traditional hammock set-up in that they are intended to be pitched in trees or at a basecamp for sleeping and relaxing in.</p><p>A camping hammock only is suitable for warm and dry weather. You can add a tarp to cover your hammock for coverage from rain, but this may not offer full protection from wind or sideways rain. A hammock tent is fully enclosed with a built-in insect mesh and rainfly (which is usually removable) and gives the best protection from unpredictable weather.</p><p>They are available in a range of sizes for all camping occasions, from solo hiking trips to group or family excursions.</p><ul><li><p>Single-person camping hammocks</p></li><li><p>Two-person camping hammocks</p></li><li><p>Three-person camping hammocks</p></li><li><p>Family camping hammocks</p></li></ul><h3>Yurt</h3><p>Yurt houses come in two main types: permanent which is mostly made of wood, and portable that are a combination of wood, canvas or fabric. They're really affordable and can be built very quickly in case you need something done in a short amount of time.</p><p>Yurts also offer comfortable living as they can protect you from extreme heat and cold and at the same time last a long time. It's a great example of highly sustainable design.</p><p>Yurts also offer comfortable living as they can protect you from extreme heat and cold and at the same time last a long time.

camping food,"<h2>Types of Camping Food</h2><p>One of the great things about camping is that it gives you the opportunity to try new things and be creative with your menu. Of course, you'll want to make sure you have all the basics covered, but don't be afraid to experiment a bit.</p><p>After all, there's no need to cook complicated meals when you're out in the wilderness. Instead, focus on simple, hearty dishes that will fill you up after a long day of hiking. And don't forget to pack plenty of snacks!</p><ul><li>Easy-to-prepare food is critical. You don't want to spend all your time cooking when you could enjoy the surroundings instead.</li><li>Food that doesn t require refrigeration is ideal since you may not have access to one on your trip.</li><li>Choose food that will give you the energy you need to hike, fish, and explore all day long.</li><li>It's essential to strike the right balance between convenience and nutrition.</li></ul><h3>Dry Goods:</h3><ul><li>Dried fruits and vegetables</li><li>Dried meat</li><li>Nuts</li><li>Crackers</li><li>Granola bars or energy bars</li><li>Chips</li><li>Jerky</li><li>Trail mix</li><li>Candy, chocolate bars, and marshmallows</li><li>Oatmeal</li><li>Peanut butter</li><li>Hard Cheese</li><li>Tortillas</li><li>Spices</li></ul><h3>Canned foods</h3><p>Here are some versatile canned foods options for camping:</p><ul><li>Canned Chicken</li><li>Canned Roast Beef</li><li>Canned Chili</li><li>Canned Ham</li><li>Veggies: carrots, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, celery, corn, mushrooms, green chiles, green beans, potatoes</li><li>Canned Beans: Baked beans, black beans, and refried beans</li><li>Pickles</li><li>Olives</li></ul><h3>Condiment Packets</h3><p>Always ask for extras at the fast food drive-through so you can stock up on individual packets of ketchup, mustard, mayo, jelly, and honey.</p><h3>Premade and Prepackaged Meals</h3><p>One of the best things about prepackaged camping food is that it takes all the guesswork out of meal planning, and they fit into all three of our categories! Whether you're headed out for a day hike or a week-long backpacking trip, there's no need to worry about packing enough of the right food. Just grab a few prepackaged meals, and you'll be all set.</p><p>Plus, prepackaged camping food is designed to be lightweight and easy to carry, so you won't have to worry about lugging around a heavy cooler. Another great thing about prepackaged camp food is that it's usually quite affordable. Rather than having to buy different ingredients for each meal, you can simply purchase a few prepackaged meals and be done with them. So if you're looking for an easy, convenient, and affordable way to feed yourself while camping, prepackaged camp food is definitely the way to go.</p>"
camping tarps,"<h2>Types of camping tarps</h2><h3>Rectangle Tarps</h3><p>Rectangle tarps are the best for one-person shelters because they are the easiest to set up alone. The smallest sized tarp we would recommend for a solo thru-hiker would be around 7 x 9 feet which gives you the space to put your bag and not get hit by rain on windy nights.</p><p>You can make an easy lean-to or a simple A-frame shelter with a low profile that will completely cover your entire body and backpack. The more attachment loops the better.</p><h3>Square Tarps</h3><p>Square tarps are by far the most versatile and can be set up in lots of different ways. A decent 3 x 3-meter tarp will sleep around 3 people comfortably and isn't so big it can't be used by one person.</p><p>Hammock campers especially like square tarps because they again provide a lot of coverage and they can be used in a diagonal position for the best off the ground protection under a tarp.</p><h3>Hex Tarps</h3><p>Hex rain tarps are hexagonal in shape and are well suited to both ground shelters and for use with a hammock. The two longest points provide excellent protection for your hammock and even stop the rain from soaking your hammock ropes.</p><p>You get a kind of porch area with the two ridgeline points that provides good rain protection for cooking or sitting up and makes getting in and out much easier too. There are even some tarps that have added an extra side to become a heptagon tarp but</p><h3>Asym Tarps</h3><p>Asymmetrical tarps are basically an off-center diamond shape that is designed for hammock campers who sleep on a diagonal. By sleeping with your head off one side of the hammock and your feet off the other, you create a flatter platform to sleep on. An asym tarp compliments this position but do you really want to limit yourself?</p><p>The tapered rectangle shape is lightweight and compact for one person to carry and easy to set up with a ridgeline and two guy lines only. The asymmetrical design is not well suited to ground tarp camping however it can be done if needed.</p><h3>Cat Cut Tarps</h3><p>What is a catenary cut tarp? The word catenary is a mathematical term for the curve a hanging chain or cord between two points. When talking about waterproof camping tarps the catenary cut refers to the curved edges between the tie-off points.</p><p>Cat cut rain tarps are designed to reduce any sag in the roof with every tie-off point pulling the fabric taut in unison. This gives you a very stable shelter every time however you are limited to the different ways you can set one up.</p><p>Curved tarps are great for setting up off the ground with a hammock and for summer tarp camping on the ground due to the extra ventilation the edges provide. You get superb protection in the middle of the tarp but you have to really tuck your gear in to stop it from getting wet in heavy rain.</p>"
4 person tents,"<h2>Types of 4-person Tents</h2><p>Tent design has come a long way over the past few decades though. Now, we can break down tents based on their shape or setup.</p><p>It's actually very important to know about these different types of tents because some are much better suited for certain types of camping like some shapes of tents being ble to withstand to bad weather better or certain tents having more interior space for large families.</p><h3>Dome Tents</h3><p>They consist of two poles which cross over eacher to make the tent structure. The ends of the poles go into the tent's floor (or ground sheet). This creates a free-standing structure which doesn't need guylines or stakes to stay up. A waterproof layer can go on top of this. They are very easy and quick to set up.</p><p><br />The downside of the dome shape is that the walls are curved. Thus, the ceiling height will be low in many parts of the tent.</p><h3>Extended dome tents</h3><p>These tents use the criss-crossing pole design but they also have a curved pole (or poles) which extend off to the size. This pole is often used to create a vestibule space in front of the tent. The curved pole does need to be staked down, so the tent is only semi-freestanding. However, it is still fairly easy to set up. The design gives you much more space and versatility while still maintaining the benefits of a sturdy dome design.</p><h3>Tunnel Tents</h3><p>Tunnel tents are made up of two or more curved poles connected by the tent fabric. The pole design creates a tunnel which has consistent overhead height. Some tunnel tents have large storage areas in the middle with multiple rooms off to the side.</p><p>However, they are not freestanding and must be staked out. This makes tunnel tents a bad choice for rocky ground or sandy soil. You also have to be careful not to trip on the many guylines.</p><h3>Cabin Tents</h3><p>These tents have vertical or near vertical walls, so they resemble a cabin when set up. The vertical walls mean the interior of the tent is very spacious and you have lots of headroom. They are great for people who don't want to hunch over in the tent or want to use a cot bed inside the tent</p><p>The downside of cabin tents is that they are very big and bulky. The huge footprint means you can't pitch them just anywhere. Cabin tents are also not great against high winds. Because most cabin tents are just one-layer, condensation can build up inside the tent and drip water on you while you sleep.</p><h3>Geodesic or Semi-Geodesic Tents</h3><p>Geodesic tents consist of multiple poles which overlap each other. The overlapping tent construction creates a very stable structure. They are almost always freestanding. Geodesic tents are also usually a round shape as this allows rain, wind, and snow to go over the tent.</p><p>The only real downside of geodesic tents is that they can be hard to set up. It's easy to get confused as to where the criss-crossing poles go.</p><h3>Rooftop Tents</h3><p>Rooftop tents are installed on top of your vehicle. Depending on the type, you unfold, inflate, or pop-up the tent when you want to use it. You use a ladder to climb into the tent.</p><p>Rooftop tents aren't for everyone though. Small children or uneasy sleepers can fall out of rooftop tents. They perform poorly in wind. You've got to empty the tent and fold it away if you want to drive anywhere.</p><h3>Popup Tents</h3><p>Popup tents usually have one or two poles which are built into the tent fabric. The poles are flexible and keep coiled up. When you uncoil the tent, it pops into shape.</p><p>While popup tents are ridiculously easy to set up, they have numerous downsides. The main one is that they are unstable and will often even blow away in light winds. Because they only have one layer, condensation is a huge problem with them. They are also huge discs when stored and annoying to carry.</p>"
lpvo scopes,"<h2>Types of LPVOs</h2><h3>First focal plane</h3><p>First or front focal plane scopes place the reticle in front of the scope&rsquo;s erector. This creates the effect of the reticle growing and shrinking as magnification increases or decreases. Nothing actually grows or shrinks, and the magnification just makes it appear to occur. Modern LPVO reticles often feature markings for bullet drop and windage and tools like rangefinders.</p><p>These markings are measurements typically in MOA or MILs. With LPVOs in particular, the illuminated portions and reticles shrink at lower settings. This gives the illuminated portion a red dot-like small size, and since the main reticle shrinks, it&rsquo;s not obstructing your vision for close-quarter shooting.</p><h3>Second focal plane</h3><p>Second focal plane scopes place the reticle behind the scope&rsquo;s erector. This has the effect of the reticle remaining the same size throughout the magnification range.&nbsp;In the world of LPVOs, this can limit your capabilities with high-powered magnified optics. If it&rsquo;s a 1-8X or 1-10X, you want an FFP reticle, and depending on the reticle design for a 1-6X, you might want FFP as well. If you use a 1-4X or even 1.5-5X, then an SFP will likely be perfectly capable.</p><p>LPVOs with lower power and simple reticles can benefit from benign SFP optics. For example, the Trijicon Accupoint&rsquo;s triangle reticle benefits from remaining the same size as magnification increases due to its large size.</p>"
compact binoculars,"<h2>Types of Compact Binoculars</h2><p>Binoculars are built for a range of uses, and the same goes for compact binoculars. Before you pull the trigger on your next pair, make sure the positive reviews you see online are applicable to how you plan on using a set of binoculars. Allow us to hit the high points so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Sporting</h3><p>Lots of people like to bring binoculars to sporting events and concerts. It can be nice to have a magnified view of the action, especially when you're in a large stadium that makes a massive screen look like a thumbnail. They're also popular for checking in on a birdfeeder from a nearby window. These compact binoculars prioritize lightness and affordability.</p><p>Because sporting binoculars are used in very controlled environments, they don't need to be particularly durable. Manufacturers reduce costs by eliminating protection against water, dust, and extreme temperatures. We wouldn't recommend these binoculars unless you have no plans to use them in austere environments.</p><h3>Birdwatching</h3><p>Birdwatching is serious business. Differentiating between similar species from a distance requires realistic colors and crisp lines. In fact, some of the best resources for researching binoculars can be found on sites dedicated to birdwatching.</p><p>The binoculars built for birders are generally high-quality items that provide excellent views and can be adjusted to a wide range of eyes, with or without glasses. They're relatively durable and feel right at home in the forest or sightseeing in a new city. They also make a great entry point for people looking for their first pair of quality binoculars because of their balance between price and features.</p><h3>Hunting</h3><p>Binoculars intended for hunting are held to a higher standard than most. That's because hunters encounter severe weather, harsh terrain, and limits on the amount of gear they can carry. A clear view can also spot the difference between a trophy animal and an immature buck that needs a year or two to grow.</p><p>Hunting binoculars are also great for tactical use. Lenses are built from high-quality glass and receive several coatings to protect against fog, glare, and scratches. The air inside hunting binoculars is typically purged with nitrogen to prevent internal fogging. Rubber seals keep out water and dust that can ruin a pair of binoculars. Durable rubber exteriors provide improved grip and protect against impacts.</p>"
pens for writing,"<h2>Types of Pens</h2><p>Writing style is just an easy way of saying how the pen delivers ink to the writing surface. There are quite a few styles out there.</p><h3>Ballpoint</h3><p>The ballpoint pen is the hip-hop ballerina of pens. It's the most versatile and works for pretty much any writing surface.</p><p>Basically, ballpoints have a small ball rolls at the tip of the pen which spreads oil-based ink when pressure is applied.</p><p>They tend to be less expensive, easily accessible, and ready to go at any moment... Like those little packages of orange peanut butter crackers.</p><h3>Fountain Pen</h3><p>Fountain pens use a feed to bring liquid ink down to the tip of the pen. They are flexible and adapt to the handwriting of the user, and they make your signature look awesome.</p><p>Their only downfall (for some users) is they require a level of upkeep and maintenance.</p><p>Some users love that feeling of being involved in the maintenance of their pen. But, if not attended to, the water-based ink will dry up like those guys that took the cursed jars in the Mummy.</p><p>Fortunately, with little cleaning and ink refilling, a fountain pen is right back to work.</p><p>While they feel fancy and delicate, the best fountain pen can stand up to a lot of daily use like any other pen. So don't let the glass shoes fool you: they deliver.</p><h3>Rollerball</h3><p>Rollerballs (sometimes calling&nbsp;rolling ball or select tip pens) are the best of both worlds between a ballpoint and a fountain pen.</p><p>They have the same small ball mechanism of the ballpoint with the liquid based ink of a fountain pen so you get a smooth writing experience without the upkeep.</p><h3>Gel Pen</h3><p>Gel pens are technically, basically, mostly just rollerballs.</p><p>The term is often used interchangeably in luxury pens. They have the same writing mechanism as a rollerball.</p><p>Gel pens have ink that is gel/water-based, and that makes it just the slightest bit sticky, so it adheres to pretty much any surface. Unlike water-based inks, gel ink doesn't need to sink as deep into the surface to catch and come out clear.</p><p>That said, a lot of rollerball pens have the same ink as gel pens too. At that point, gel pens and rollerball pens are different in name only.</p><h3>Felt Tip Pen</h3><p>A felt tip pen can mean anything from an archival pen to the Crayola scented markers.</p><p>Porous fibers are pressed together to form the writing tip. The fibers soak up the ink and voila! writing. Markers, highlighters.</p><h3>Stylus</h3><p>The stylus is back.</p><p>Now focused on all our fancy tablets, stylus pens are ideal for writing on computer screens and the like.</p><p>Unless you are buying one with your tablet, it is much more common to see styluses as an added on feature to a ballpoint pen.</p><h3>Ergonomic pens</h3><p>These are the best pens for reducing hand stress. Their large grips are easier to hold, and theyre available in ballpoint, rollerball, and gel versions.</p>"
ballistic helmets,"<h2>Types of Ballistic Helmets</h2><p>Ballistic helmets come in two primary shapes: high cut and full cut. Most of the helmets on this list are high cuts. They allow for the mounting of powered hearing protection, which is a must-have in an environment where gunfire is expected.</p><h3>High cut</h3><p>The various ""cuts"" of helmets refer to how the helmet fits over your ears and accommodate communication headsets. They're listed as mid cut, high cut, and ultra high cut. They range from having some ear cover to a flat ear cover to no ear cover.</p><p>The downside is that these cuts of helmets leave the sides of your head vulnerable to shrapnel and incoming rounds, so you have to weigh whether or not the added convenience of powered hearing protection or a headset is worth the marginal reduction in protection.</p><h3>Full cut</h3><p>Full cut helmets cover the entirety of your skull and some have an extended ""skirt"" that covers your neck and ears. They're the most common in military issue. They provide good protection without extending into the realm of full-face protection or other types of enhanced helmets.</p><p>The downside to this profile of helmet is that it's difficult to mount headsets or hearing protection underneath the helmet, so you'll need to put them on separately and weave microphones, cables, and earcups through the straps.</p>"
camping cots,"<h2>Types of Camping Cots</h2><p>Camping cots are portable beds that get your sleeping bag up off the ground for a more comfortable night's sleep. Without rocks and roots stabbing you in the back, you'll wake up refreshed and ready to go.</p><p>The most accommodating camping cots offer unique features like cupholders, tilting headrests, mosquito netting, and even air mattresses.</p><p>There are different approaches to this, so feel free to explore your options.</p><ul><li>Traditional cots are wide enough for one sleeping bag and stand about knee-high, with a canvas panel stretched tight to provide a sleeping surface.</li><li>Compact options sit lower to the ground to save space and weight, but might not as comfortable. </li></ul><p>We found camping cots seem to be split into two camps: standard and ultralight.</p><h3>Standard Cots</h3><p>They are generally 10-30 pounds and are made with a heavy-duty metal frame and a canvas or other fabric bed to sleep on. They are a great option for extended stays or if you want to sleep off the ground but can be a bit cumbersome and hard to carry.</p><h3>Ultralight Cots</h3><p>As the name suggests, are considerably lighter, with a composite frame. These cots fold up small and light enough to strap to a pack, weighing less than 5 pounds or so, but you do make some concessions when it comes to comfort and cost. As with everything ultralight, you can expect to pay a premium.</p>"
bedside gun safes,"<h2>Types Of Bedside Gun Safes</h2><p>Most gun safes are massive storage containers capable of resisting burglars, fire, and more, but when you need something close at hand for when you hear glass shattering in the night, a traditional door-style safe may not be your best option. As such, most bedside safes rely on one of three different designs to keep things handy and compact: clamshell, drawer, or dropdown.</p><h3>Clamshell</h3><p>The clamshell-type of safe is a simple, straightforward design and one of the most common. Opening a clamshell safe is as familiar as flipping open your new MacBook Pro with the added inconvenience of unlocking the lid first. Most often, the best clamshell safes rely on mechanical locks, although electronic locking mechanisms are also available.</p><p>These safes tend to provide plenty of storage space, multiple anchor points, sturdy construction, and some of the most secure and reliable lock offerings of all bedside safes. Clamshell-style safes can be reasonably portable - at least they can if they include a carry handle - although in many cases, clamshells lack this feature. Probably the biggest downsides to this safe type are a boring aesthetic and a space-hogging footprint.</p><h3>Drawer</h3><p>Drawer-type bedside safes can be incredibly convenient and usually fit nicely inside nightstand drawers or mount directly underneath bedside tabletops. These horizontal safes slide out smoothly for quick and easy access to your firearm while minimizing your need to move in order to reach your weapon. Like clamshell safes, drawer safes may employ either a mechanical lock or an electronic one.</p><p>Drawer safes tend to be quite convenient and often include anchor points and/or anchor cables to secure them in place. One potential drawback to drawer-type bedside safes is their mounting surfaces. While bolting the safe to your nightstand may make it childproof, a burglar could easily pick up and remove the entire table in order to take a crack at your safe when he has more time on his hands.</p><h3>Drop-down</h3><p>The drop-down bedside safe is a natural evolution of the drawer safe. These safes are vertically oriented and feature a lock at the top and a pivot point at the bottom. Once unlocked, these safes drop open, revealing a ready-to-use handgun. Most often, drop-down safes rely on an electronic lock with a key bypass in case you forget your passcode.</p><p>While drop-down safes may just be the most convenient for quick access, they often come with the drawback of limited mounting locations due to the inherent security downsides of mounting any safe to a loose piece of furniture. Their (usual) lack of a mechanical lock also makes them more susceptible to water damage and electronics failures, serious concerns in a life-or-death situation.</p>"
camping grills,"<h2>Types of Camping Grills</h2><p>Camping grills come in several different types based on size, cooking method, and appearance.</p><p>When it comes to portable grills then you're going to be looking mainly at two types of grill and that is propane and charcoal. Both of them have their advantages and disadvantages which we will go through here so you can decide which is going to be the best portable bbq grill for you.</p><h3>Propane</h3><p>Most of them have electronic ignition systems which will start at just the push of a button where a portable charcoal grill takes a lot longer to get going. When they do get going you are also able to control the temperature a lot easier as you can alter the amount of gas getting to the grill. This means that you prevent common problems such as flare-ups, your food not being cooked properly or excessive charring as well. The gas will also burn a lot more cleanly and won't produce smoke meaning these types of grills can also be used indoors. The ease of use is also helped by the fact that the grill cools down a lot more quickly and you don't have to worry about getting rid of any embers or ashes.</p><p>Those are significant advantages but propane doesn't burn as hot as charcoal meaning that you can't cook food in quite the same way and also these propane grills won't allow you to impart a smoky flavor that some people love about charcoal grills so your food might not be quite as tasty and this is probably the biggest reason as to why people buy these type of grills. There is also the matter of cost as well as the initial set up costs of a propane grill are going to be higher an then you always have to worry about always replenishing your propane tanks and this is generally a lot more expensive than charcoal. Also those tanks are disposable so you have to take them with you wherever you go until you find somewhere to recycle them.</p><h3>Charcoal</h3><p>Probably the biggest advantage when it comes to a charcoal grill is one of taste as most people would say that they prefer the taste of food that comes due to the fact that you can sear food a lot better with this type of grill. Charcoal is a lot more readily available than propane and is a lot cheaper too. In transport you have to make sure that your propane tanks are stored in the correct position and are well ventilated. With charcoal you don't have any of these worries as you can just throw them into your car and you also don't have to worry about recycling once done.</p><p>While the smokiness of a charcoal grill can be an advantage in many respects in terms of flavor, it can also be a downside too as this smoke can fill your area and obviously means that the grill can't be used indoors as well. In smaller spaces this makes getting a propane grill a more sensible solution to your grilling needs. There is also the factor of the mess as well. Once you have finished then you can just shut off a propane tank whereas with charcoal you need to snuff those hot coals as well as clearing and ashes out of your grill as well.</p>"
folding knives,"<h2>Types of Pocket Knives</h2><p>Pocket knives can be classified differently, according to some common features they have. Here are some of them.</p><h3>The Clip Point</h3><p>This is one of the most popular pocket knife blades. It derives its name from a straight or curved cutout area on the unsharpened back edge of the blade. This design is meant to make the tip sharper. The clip point is ideal for piercing and general cutting, though the narrow tip makes it weak.</p><h3>The Drop Point</h3><p>The drop point has a straight spine which is straight but towards the point it gently slopes down to meet the bottom part of the blade, forming a drop point. This pocket knife works like the clip point, but it is much stronger as the point is broader.</p><h3>The Pen Blade</h3><p>Originally used to sharpen quills, the pen blade is now used for small cutting tasks.It is small, with the spine and the edge of the knife sloping towards each other at the same angle, making it look like a spear point.</p><h3>Sheepsfoot</h3><p>This blade was originally used to trim the hooves of sheep. It has a straight cutting edge and a straight spine which curves smoothly towards the tip. Its straight edge provides a large surface that makes it ideal for slicing and cutting.</p><h3>The Spey Blade</h3><p>This blade's original purpose was for castrating and spaying farm animals. Both spine and cutting edge are straight, suddenly sloping towards each other near the tip. Spey blades are found on pocket knives with multiple blades. They're great for skinning furry animals.</p><h3>The Tanto Point</h3><p>Also known as a chisel point, this blade features a straight cutting edge with an angular point. It is strong and is used for making push cuts, stabbing, and piercing tough materials.</p><h3>The Wharncliffe Blade</h3><p>These are not very common, but they're great all-rounders. They look similar to sheepsfoot blades, but the spine begins to curve downwards much closer to the handle, meeting the tip gradually.</p>"
air mattresses for camping,"<h2>Types of Air Mattresses For Camping</h2><h3>Closed-cell</h3><p>Lately, I've noticed more and more thru-hikers with accordion-style sleeping pads attached to the backs of their packs. After rolling into way too many campsites late in the afternoon after long days on the trail and having to spend what feels like an eternity blowing up my air mattress, I can see the appeal.</p><p>The name comes from the material used to manufacture the pad, rigid closed cell foam (CCF), which is a dense material with tiny trapped air pockets for insulation and cushioning. While closed-cell sleeping pads don't provide the same R-value or comfort most blow-up mattresses will, they are lightweight, easy to set up, puncture-resistant, and way less expensive than most other sleep system options. They can also be layered for additive R-value and cushioning if you have the room.</p><h3>Inflatable</h3><p>Inflatable camping mattresses look a lot like pool mattresses. Both are generally made from the same type of polyvinyl material and when blown up provide 2.5- to 3-inches of air between your backside and the ground. Many inflatable camping mattresses also contain reflective material inside for additional insulation and comfort. Depending on whether you are a back or side sleeper, the firmness mattress can be tailored to suit your sleep style by simply adding a few extra breaths during setup.</p><p>While they take more time to blow up and take down than close cell options, can make a lot of noise if you toss and turn at night, and are more to puncture, inflatable mattresses are generally lightweight, cost-effective, pack down to less than the size of a Nalgene bottle, and provide excellent camping comfort. Four-season inflatable mattresses even contain down insulation for extra insulation, and many air mattresses even have a pump, either separate or integrated into their stuff sacks, for faster set up.</p><h3>Self-inflating</h3><p>Self-inflating camping mattresses are constructed out of a combination of open-cell foam and polyvinyl, providing up to 4-inches of insulation and max cushioning and comfort. To set up a self-inflating mattress, all you have to do is unroll the pad, open the air valve, and wait 20 to 30 minutes for the air cells in the foam to expand. You can even add air by manually adding a few breaths to the pad for firmer support.</p><p>Thanks to their dual-material construction, self-inflating camping mattresses provide arguably the most warmth, comfort, and quiet, regardless of your sleep style or the season. The downside is that this style of mattress is heavier and doesn't pack down as small as a regular air mattress. However, if comfort is king for you and you can spare the room in your pack on your camping excursions, a self-inflating mattress is a luxurious and warm good way to go.</p>"
concealed carry holsters ,"<h2>Types of Concealed Carry Holsters</h2><p>There are nine main types of concealed carry gun holsters. Each provides different levels of accommodation in terms of comfort and concealment.</p><h3>Shoulder Holsters</h3><p>A shoulder holster is very comfortable and it is designed to wrap around your shoulders while the actual pocket for the gun hangs off the harness bands and rests on the side of your rib cage. They allow for additional accessories, such as magazines, to be carried along. and can easily carry larger handguns.</p><p>The cons of these concealed are require a jacket, coat, or another outer garment to be worn for concealment. The draw is slower than drawing from the hip it requires a 180-degree sweeping motion of the barrel.</p><h3>Inside-the-Waistband (IWB) Holsters</h3><p>An inside-the-waistband holster is designed to clip, or otherwise be attached, to your belt or pants so that it can be carried inside your waistband. Your slacks, pants, or shorts perform the task of concealment and your belt provides the support.</p><p>In terms of concealability and detection, larger guns mayresult in a visible print or be more uncomfortable. Guns with smaller profiles will be less noticeable and typically more comfortable.</p><p>The fact that the gun is being holstered inside your waistband can create accessibility issues. It can require additional effort to get a proper draw on your weapon if the placement isn't ideal.</p><h3>Ankle Holsters</h3><p>An ankle holster is strapped to your ankle. This provides the benefit of being highly effective in concealment provided that your pants are not cut to be worn too tightly.</p><p>Some of the limitations of ankle holsters include the size of the handgun that they can comfortably accommodate.Another issue with ankle holsters involves the degree and the ease of accessibility you have for your gun. The fact that it is attached to your ankle and that you must reach down to draw it can be seen as a negative. This is why some prefer to use ankle holsters as a method to carry a backup weapon to their every-day-carry</p><h3>Thigh Holsters</h3><p>Concealed carry thigh holsters are strapped to your thigh. This tends to limit their use to women who are wearing dresses or skirts. The concealment comes from those particular pieces of clothing. The fact that dresses and skirts can easily be lifted to access the weapon makes reaching the weapon relatively easy.</p><p>These types of concealed carry thigh holsters should not be confused with a tactical thigh holster.</p><h3>Belly Band Holsters</h3><p>A belly band holster wraps around your abdomen and your upper clothing provides the concealment. It is important to note that the term belly band holster is best applied to those meant to be worn high on the abdomenabove the waist.</p><p>Belly band holsters provide effective concealment when worn by individuals wearing a loose-fitting shirt or another garment. Some people might find this type of holster uncomfortable and the concealment profile might be reduced.</p><p>Some may find an issue with true belly band holsters as it relates to the accessibility to your weapon when drawing. This is because it requires you to reach under your shirt or blouse or unbutton it to draw.</p><h3>Bra Holsters</h3><p>A bra holster uses a woman's bra to keep the holstered gun firmly against her body in a comfortable and concealed way. These types of holsters are designed for handguns with smaller profiles. However, when combined with a top that is not too form-fitting, the level of concealment can be very effective.</p><h3>Concealment Bag Holsters</h3><p>Not all holsters for concealed carry require that they be worn directly on your person. Concealment bag holsters are designed to be incorporated into routine carrying accessories.</p><p>Concealment bag holsters are integrated into utilitarian carrying bags, such as:</p><ul><li>Women&rsquo;s purses</li><li>Fanny packs</li><li>Shoulder bags</li><li>Backpacks</li><li>Leg bags</li><li>Briefcases</li><li>Belt pouches</li><li>Sling bags</li></ul><p>The level of concealment provided by concealment bag holsters is extremely high. Concealment bag holsters have special compartments designed to be quickly accessible while also safely and discreetly carrying your handgun while you go about your day.</p>"
backpack coolers,"<h2>Types of Backpack Coolers</h2><p>There are a lot of choices nowadays, as every cooler and backpack company seems to make a foray into the backpack cooler market. For us, you can break these packs into two basic categories to narrow your search: waterproof and recreational backpack coolers.</p><h3>Waterproof</h3><p>These are the top-of-the-line coolers with the capability to endure white rapids and have the necessary tie-down anchors to keep them in place. With these types of packs, you can traverse rivers and endure anything mother nature can throw at you, all while retaining ice at a premium rate, and keeping whatever's inside safe and secure.</p><h3>Recreational</h3><p>These are built to fuel you for the day's adventure. The non-waterproof nature of them makes them more comfortable to wear, but their durability also takes a hit. Not worrying about possibly being submerged in water, they cater to the population that is taking a trip to the park, beach, or trailhead that isn't so worried about keeping things cooled down for days on end.</p>"
camping gear,"<h2>Types of Camping Gear</h2><h3>What are the necessities for camping?</h3><p>While you're reading through the list, consider if you can manage without or if you'd like to bring it along. Everyone's comfort levels are different!</p><p>This list is intended for families that are car camping and that are content to camp without electricity... simple camping. Remember, you can always bring more things along with you... these camping items are just your starting point!</p><h3>Shelter: The Essential Camping Gear</h3><ul><li>Something to sleep in: If you don't have a camper, you'll need a tent. If your family is adventurous you might even want to try hammocks, or tarp-tent shelters.<br /><br /></li><li>Sleeping Bags or Bedding: Each member will need something to sleep in. If it's cold, bring extra blankets and your top-quality sleeping bags. If it's hot, use DIY sheet sacs or lightweight blankets and sleeping bags. For your babies and toddlers, you might choose to use a sleep sack and extra blankets instead of a sleeping bag to ensure they stay covered up through the night.</li><li>Pillows: You can either bring your regular house pillows, keep pillows in the camper or your camping supplies, or use travel or camping pillows.<br /><br /></li><li>Air mattress or sleeping pads: If you're not hauling beds along to the campground, then you'll probably want a cot, air mattress, or camping mattress for each person. Some air mattresses are quite thin or deflate over the course of one night. Some camping pads will have better insulation levels than others. And, there is a wide price difference between them all.<br /><br /></li><li><p>Air pump: If you're bringing an air mattress, you""ll need to make sure you can inflate it. If it's an electric pump, will you have electricity at the site.</p></li><li><p>Special sleeping aids:Don't forget that tatty blanket or matted bunny that your little one just can't sleep without. You might also appreciate having some ear plugs so you're not being wokenmby other campers (or strange noises) through the night.</p></li><li><p>Clothing:You'll need to plan for the weather. Rubber boots, sandals, coats, hats, bathing suits, pajamas, and an assortment of cool and warm weather clothing depending on your camping climate.</p></li><li><p>Folding camp chairs:While perhaps not an absolute necessity for camping, having a comfortable chair with back support can be really nice; otherwise, you're sitting on crates, stumps, the ground, and possibly a bench for the whole trip.</p></li><li><p>Tarp and ropes: If shade is needed or you're concerned about rain, bring along a tarp or two. Make sure your ropes are long enough to stretch across the campsite and if you are camping without trees you may want to bring something to use as a support pole.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Food: The Camping Essentials for your Camp Kitchen</strong></h3><ul><li>Good quality knife: You don't want to find yourself slicing a watermelon with a plastic butter knife! Knives with their own holder or sleeve will protect fingers when digging through the camping kitchen tub.</li><li>Multipurpose tool / knife: One of these are handy to bring along for small fix-it jobs and other mishaps.</li><li>Forks, knives, spoons: Make sure there's one of each for each camper, then throw in a few extra for serving and cooking. You could also use sporks, these are the ones we use!</li><li>Large serving spoon and spatula: Long-handled utensils makes it easier and safer to stir stew and flip pancakes over the campfire</li><li>Can opener, cork screw/bottle opener: Your regular old hand-held, basic one will do... but really, this is only a camping necessity if you plan on bringing anything that you can't open with your bare hands or your multi-tool.</li><li>Paper towels: Handy for messy spills, messy hands, and messy meals.</li><li>Tin foil: You'll need good quality foil if you plan to cook any foil meals over the fire. You can also use the foil to keep left-overs for later. Remember that tin foil can be washed, reused, and recycled.</li><li>Large cooking pot: If you're a large family or plan to do more involved cooking you may want to bring a few pots. Second-hand camp cooking pots are great, lightweight options for camping. You might find a set with different sized pots and a fry pan.</li><li>Water jug: If you don't have a camper with water hook-up, having a large jug of water at your site will save many trips to and from the nearest water tap.</li><li>Plates, bowls, mugs: One for each person plus a few extra for cooking and serving. If you really wanted to do minimalist packing, you could bring just one enamel camping mug per person and use that to eat out of as well!</li><li>Dish tub, wash rag, dish towels, soap: Unless you plan to haul all your dirty dishes home, you'll have to wash them at the campsite. You'll find it easiest to have 2 or 3 tubs for washing, towels to lay the dishes on to dry, a scrub pad, and a wash cloth.</li><li>Plastic bags for garbage: You""ll need to keep your garbage packaged and away from animals. The best way to do this is to have a few plastic shopping bags on hand. Then, throw your filled garbage bags into the dumpsters at the campground. Some campgrounds will have recycling facilities as well.</li><li>The food: Make sure you've got enough to feed everyone, then add a little more... and don't forget the marshmallows and snacks!</li></ul><h3>Safety: The Camping Essentials of Protection and Rescue</h3><ul><li>Bugspray: Just bring whichever you think works best for you and your family.</li><li>Bear Spray:If camping in bear country, you should look into the locally commended ways to protect yourself and your family.</li><li>Cash in small denominations: For unexpected costs like firewood, camp registrations, activity rentals, midnight vending machine snacks, and boat launch fees.</li><li>Matches or lighter, fire starter materials:It's always important to have a lighter or matches for lighting propane stoves, candles, and camp fires. As for fire starter materials, just fill a small box with lightweight cardboard and newspaper or use your food containers as you empty them.</li><li>Axe or Hatchet: If you plan on having campfires, you'll likely need to split some smaller wood pieces for fire starting. Also, not all campgrounds split their provided fire wood.</li><li>First aid kit: Here's the basics for you family camping first aid kit: Band-aids, small and large gauze dressings, disposable sterile gloves, tweezers, small scissors, triangular bandage, extra pads or tampons, alcohol swabs, safety pins, medical adhesive tape, anti-itch cream, anti-bacterial ointment and antihistamines (epi-pen?) and medication for pain and fever in age-appropriate dosages.</li></ul><p> Flashlight/ Headlamp/ Lantern: You'll want some way to light your way in the dark. Headlamps are particularly handy for night time reading, preparing midnight snacks, and changing 3am diapers.</p><h3>Comfort: All those extras which are nice, but not necessarily essential</h3><p>You'd survive your camping trip just fine without these items, but it might be more enjoyable or comfortable if you did decide to bring these along as well.</p><ul><li>Bath towels, facecloths</li><li>Toothbrushes, soap, hairbrush elastics</li><li>Reusable water bottles</li><li>Roasting sticks</li><li>Coffee maker</li><li>Coffee thermos</li><li>Kettle</li><li>Easy-up Shelter</li><li>Folding Table</li>"
camping water filters,"<h2>Types of Backpacking Water Filters</h2><h3>Gravity Filters</h3><p>A gravity water filter is like its namesake, a simple yet effective water filter that can be hung from a tree branch or from a tent pole. An unfiltered water bag is connected through a hose into a filtered water bag.</p><p>The benefits of a gravity filter are that it's very easy to use, it removes the chunky bits and it's pretty quick in filtering high volumes of water. If you're filtering water for the whole family, gravity filters are your new best friend when backpacking.</p><h3>Pump Filters</h3><p>A pump filter works by simply using a pump-action with your hand to filter water. The advantages of pump filters are that it physically traps most waterborne nasties and it's easy to use. If you have strong arms it will be easy to use and if you don't, it will be a good workout</p><h3>Ultraviolet (UV) Purifiers</h3><p>An ultraviolet water purifier treats unsafe water with germicidal ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet radiation renders bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi unable to replicate by damaging the nucleic acids of their DNA.</p><p>The advantages of a UV water purifier are that it produces clean water without chemicals, there's no taste or odour, it's easy to maintain and there's no water waste.</p><h3>Bottle Filters</h3><p>A water bottle filter is often a BPA-free bottle that is reusable, with the filter built into the design of the water bottle. It means you can drink filtered water without waiting.</p><p>It's ideal for someone who's impatient, perfect for trail running or training for a half or full marathon.</p><h3>Squeeze Filter</h3><p>A squeeze filter is just like its namesake, as you simply fill up the pouch at a stream and then squeeze the bag to filter water into a bottle.</p><p>It's great for ultralight backpacking or three to five-day hikes.</p><h3>Straw Filters</h3><p>Straw Filters are basically water purification straws and they protect you from drinking bacteria, microplastics and protozoa.</p><p>They are perfect for camping, backpacking, hiking, first aid or emergency kits. Forget about bigger is better, as straw filters are ultralight and basically the size of a big straw.</p><h3>Chemicals</h3><p>Chemical water treatments often come as drops or tablets that you simply add to water and let sit for a couple of minutes (depending on the volume of water). They are effective against bacteria, viruses and protozoa.</p><p>This water treatment method is super easy to use, inexpensive and ultra-light, making it the perfect go-to for pretty much all kinds of trips (hiking, backpacking, car-camping, etc.) But, of course, this method won't filter your muddy water, so a pre-filter or a piece of cloth might be required depending on your water source. If you're taste-sensitive, you might find that it leaves a chemical taste.</p><h3>Boiling</h3><p>Boiling water is the old-school version of drinking safe water. It kills microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or protozoans that can cause disease. However, it will not remove harmful substances like chlorine and lead from tap water.</p><p>Boiling water is more useful for drinking coffee and tea or when you run out of all of the filtered or bottled water. The downside of using boiling water is that you need it to cool down before drinking, otherwise put the water in a bottle and then leave it in the campsite cooler.</p>"
car gun safes,"<h2>Types of Car Gun Safes</h2><h3>Biometric locking</h3><p>These safes define themselves by primarily unlocking with a programmable fingerprint scanner. The technology is commonly found in high-end home safes, but there are plenty of smaller applications that can be taken in a personal vehicle. It's often regarded as the most secure as it will only respond to the person (or people) who program it, but that's also dependent on the construction of a specific safe and how easy it is to damage or pry.</p><p>Many biometric gun safes available come in slim, portable packages, meaning that stowing them in a vehicle is effortless. That also means they have to be powered via batteries, so be cautious not to let yourself get locked away from your firearms. Keep those emergency manual keys handy.</p><h3>Portable</h3><p>This encompasses nearly all available car gun safes. Compact, portable, and relatively inexpensive, these will give you the secure storage that you need in a package you can switch from car to car and even check-in for flights. They generally won't be too cumbersome and may come in a variety of locks, but basic manual locks with a key tend to be the most common and reliable. Some models even have attached security cables for anchoring to wherever you decide to leave it.</p><p>In this range, keep a keen eye out for build quality, especially at the lower end of the price range. Many can be had with durable steel construction, but some could leave gaps making you susceptible to theft. Budget-friendly lockboxes constructed of plastic exist, but obviously won't have the resilience of steel alloys.</p><h3>Fixed</h3><p>Fairly self-explanatory, these safes won't be going anywhere unless you have the time to uninstall them. They'll be affixed in place, meaning that moving them will prove more of a burden, but they will typically have better storage abilities given their designs.</p><p>Some console safes may reconfigure the entire console into a miniature bomb shelter for your valuables with the entire square footage of space at the expense of obliterating your normal center console storage. Larger safes exist to fit entire rifles into the back ends of SUVs and pickups plus room for gear and ammo, but they hold the obvious drawback of being far less accessible in a cinch during emergencies. More often than not, this will also be the most expensive type.</p>"
fishing backpacks,"<h2>Types of fishing backpacks</h2><h3>Tackle backpack</h3><p>A tackle backpack is a fishing backpack built with the primary function of holding tackle trays of various sizes. Many of the tackle backpacks are characterized by dividable inner chambers with upper and lower access flaps. This feature allows the user to keep their tackle trays stacked and separated in a separate compartment and not mixed in with other gear or camping necessities. Most tackle backpacks offer a generous amount of side pockets for additional gear such as line spools, spare reels, and all the other bits and pieces that accumulate with years of fishing.</p><h3>Sling Backpack</h3><p>Geared for the more mobile fisherman, sling backpacks allow an angler to stay on the move. A tackle backpack is likely to be set down along the shore or in a boat, but the sling backpacks are usually meant for long-term wear and are geared toward fishermen who are constantly changing location, looking for that magical spot where all the fish are biting. Most sling backpacks are equipped to either be worn over the back, or strapped across the fisherman's front. The single strap allows the fisherman to easily slide the bag from their back to their chest, granting easy access to tackle without ever having to leave the water.</p><h3>Hip Back</h3><p>Whoever said fanny packs went out of style never talked to a fisherman. Hip packs, like sling packs, are meant for constant wear, allowing the fisherman access to most of his vital gear without ever having to leave his position.</p><h3>Chest pack</h3><p>Generally geared to fly fishermen, chest packs are another great way to keep your gear accessible without having to trudge back into shore. Chest rigs tend to be a bit smaller than sling backpacks and hip packs in the interest of preserving range of motion during casting. It's for this reason that chest packs are usually marketed more toward fly fishermen, who generally require less tackle and equipment needs. If you're one to wade into deep water chasing trout, a chest pack is a good idea to keep your tackle high and dry.</p>"
compasses,"<h2>Types of Compasses</h2><h3>Baseplate compass</h3><p>The baseplate compass is the most common type of compass today. It allows for easy reading of the map because the baseplate is usually made of clear plastic with orienting arrows and lines throughout to make it easier to align the compass with your map and plot points. The baseplate usually includes an integrated magnifier to help read small print and terrain features on a map.</p><h3>Lensatic compass</h3><p>The lensatic compass is a type of sighting compass. The lensatic compass has a small magnifying lens on the near side - in fact, the term lensatic comes from the presence of this lens. The lensatic compass is commonly used similarly to a baseplate compass - level hold and eyeball the degrees - but they are designed to be used for more precision sighting. The cover of a lensatic compass has a long, vertical notch that lines up with the bezel and the magnifying lens to allow the user to get a very specific and precise directional alignment.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mirror compass</h3><p>A mirror compass has a lid that goes over the face of the compass. The underside of the lid has a mirror with a long, vertical notch. This allows the user to view their landmark through the notch while using the mirror to accurately view the magnetic needle and bezel. The result can be a more accurate azimuth towards your destination.</p><h3>Global compass</h3><p>A global compass is a compass that can be used in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This is particularly useful to those who travel extensively, like the ski bums I met in Bariloche, Argentina, who fled the northern hemisphere in the summer to ski in the Andes Mountains when the seasons reverse.</p><h3>Thumb compass</h3><p>Thumb compasses are small compasses designed to be attached to the thumb for more rapid bearings while on the move. They are not commonly used as a primary navigation device, but as a readily accessible backup. They help competitors stay on course without stopping to acquire their azimuth with the more traditional compass. They are similar to the small compass attachments you can attach to your watch strap or embed in the top of your wooden walking stick.</p>"
damascus knives,"<h2>Types of Damascus Knives</h2><h3>Damascus Fixed Blade Knives</h3><p>The most popular type of Damascus knife is the fixed blade knife. This is because it is the most durable and has the most extended lifespan.</p><p>Because of its durability, a fixed blade knife is perfect for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and hunting. The knife can also be used for everyday tasks such as cutting vegetables or opening boxes.</p><h3>Damascus Folding Knives</h3><p>Another popular type of Damascus knife is the folding knife. This type of knife has a retractable blade that can be folded into the handle. This makes it convenient to carry around and easy to store. While a folding knife is usually less durable than a fixed blade knife, if it is well constructed, these knives can be as rigid as fixed knives.</p><h3>Damascus Pocket Knives</h3><p>Damascus Pocket knives are the smallest type of Damascus knife that can be easily carried in your pocket. Damascus Pocket knives are perfect for everyday tasks such as opening letters, cutting cords or shaving wood. They are also great for outdoor activities such as camping and hiking.</p>"
gun oils,"<h2>Types Of Gun Oils</h2><p>There is more than one way to classify gun oils depending on use, delivery, and materials used. In the spirit of simplicity, I chose to classify the oil by its intended usage.</p><h3>Solvents</h3><p>If you're unfamiliar with solvents or have never heard of a solvent before, think cleaner. These are chemicals that dissolve other substances, specifically for cleaning purposes. When you fire a round, the carbon emitted from the burning of the gunpowder will accumulate in almost every nook and cranny of your gun. The buildup can be tough to remove, so using a solvent or soaking the parts in one will help dissolve the carbon buildup and make cleaning easier.</p><h3>Lubricants</h3><p>Nobody likes friction it burns and is uncomfortable. Guns don't like it either, as bare metal to metal action has the potential to cause critical failures. We're talking broken pieces, worn down parts, or worse. To ensure the action works properly and smoothly, all you have to do is apply lubricating oil. These do not clean and are solely meant to prevent unwanted friction and heating of parts.</p><h3>Protectants</h3><p>Whether you're storing your gun for months at a time or shooting regularly, it's important to have oil that protects the metal from rusting or damage. These oils are designed to enter the pores of the metal or wood and fill them up. Some oils harden a little, a process called resinification. Filling the pores is what protects the material from oxidation or other chemicals, like skin oil, that break it down over time.</p>"
camping chairs,"<h2>Types of Camping Chairs</h2><p>There are many styles of camping chairs available on the market - too many to jot down here, so instead we'll focus on the weight range. This is a huge determining factor in what the chair can do for you. Generally speaking, the more features a chair has, the heavier it will be. On the inverse side, the fewer features a chair has, the lighter it could be. The weight also determines the ease of transportability and versatility.</p><h3>Ultralight</h3><p>This is the category that any chair under three pounds belongs in. Construction is simple and uses alloy metals instead of traditional steel tubing. Fabrics will be thinner and lighter than other chairs. Typically, the design allows for the chair to be strapped to or carried inside of a hiking pack.</p><h3>Light to Medium</h3><p>Here's where you'll find the generic camping chair, as well as some fancier versions with varying features. These chairs weigh more than three pounds, but not more than 10 pounds. They'll still be easy enough to carry around, but not for any extended period of time (over five minutes). Constructions will remain simple but can include steel frames. The fabrics will be thicker and vary in texture.</p><h3>Heavy</h3><p>Anything over 10 pounds is heavy for a foldable camping chair. You might be capable of lugging it around, but why would you want to? Construction is of heavy metal framing and fabrics will feature thick materials. It is the size that generally makes these chairs so heavy. This category is really best suited for your backyard patio than camping.</p>"
family camping tents,"<h2>Types of Family Camping Tents</h2><h3>Dome-shaped tents</h3><p>These tents are your traditional arch-shaped tents. These hold up well in the wind, as they don't have vertical walls. However, they can feel more cramped than other kinds of tents, since their walls slant down on either side.</p><h3>Cabin tents</h3><p>Unlike dome-shaped tents, cabin tents have near-vertical walls, allowing most people to walk around without having to hunch. This can make your living space feel more spacious and comfortable, although these tents are better for mild weather, as their tall walls make them vulnerable to wind.</p><h3>Bell tents</h3><p>These less common tents are often made of canvas, and - unlike other types of tents - they are not not freestanding. This means they must be properly staked down to hold their shape. Most styles are held up by a single pole in the middle of the tent, rather than tent poles on the outside. These tents can feel very spacious and hold up well in extreme weather conditions.</p>"
heated gloves,"<h2>Types of Heated Gloves</h2><p>You wouldn't wear gardening gloves to shred the gnar at your local ski area and you wouldn't try to drive to work wearing mittens fit for an arctic exploration mission. The same goes for heated gloves; you need to pick the right gear for the job. Don't worry, it isn't complicated and we did the homework for you.</p><h3>Thin Heated Gloves</h3><p>Ergonomic and with good elasticity, they have been designed to promote touch sensitivity through the glove with a tactile index finger and thumb. They can be used on their own to perform an activity in a sheltered but unheated area, outdoors in moderate cold, or as an under-glove in more extreme temperatures.</p><p>Because of their thinness,thin gloves worn alone are not very effective outdoors, and are not resistant to rain or wind. They may be suitable for moderate cold weather, but should be used as under-gloves when temperatures and weather conditions deteriorate.</p><h3>Comfort Heated Gloves</h3><p>Comfort heated gloves have been specifically designed for people who are particularly sensitive to the cold, such as people with Raynaud's disease and syndrome.</p><p>Thicker thanks to an insulation lining, theys retain heat better by providing an effective thermal barrier. The temperature quickly rises to over 50° indoors and remains at over 40° outdoors.</p><p>On the other hand, these gloves are thicker and do not allow the use of a smartphone or the handling of small objects. The gloves have a thickness equivalent to a pair of thick woollen gloves.</p><h3>All-purpose heated gloves</h3><p>Why are you shopping for heated gloves in the first place? If your reasoning is that your hands are always cold, you need a glove that's comfortable doing everyday tasks like driving to work and running errands. Rugged, waterproof shells are nice to have but not necessary. You also don't need tons of insulation and a long-lasting battery.</p><p>The good news is that there are plenty of heated gloves that will do what you need them to do for a reasonable price. We found some great options for everyday use that barely crack the $100 barrier. In the world of heated gloves, that's pretty good.</p><h3>Specialized heated gloves</h3><p>If you have more specific plans for your heated gloves, you'll need to pick something that's up to the challenge. We found a few options that are great for skiing and snowboarding, hunting, and riding motorcycles. All of these provide capabilities beyond what basic heated gloves can offer.</p><p>These specialized gloves are designed with a specific activity in mind. Hunting gear needs to be camouflaged. Motorcycle gloves can't interfere with feeling the bike's controls. Winter sports require gloves that minimize hot chocolate breaks in the lodge. In any case, there's probably something out there for you if you know where to look.</p><h3>Heated liners</h3><p>Heated liners are ideal for people who plan on doing a lot of different things with their heated gloves. Liners slip into other gloves, mittens, or shells to make your battery-powered warmth more versatile. We found a great option from Hestra that you'll want to take everywhere you go.</p><p>The downside of heated liners is that they aren't meant to be worn alone. They offer little to no protection against water and wind, and they might even be damaged if you get them wet. You could probably get away with wearing them in the car or around town when the weather is cooperative, but most of the time you'll need to pair them with an appropriate shell.</p>"
flasks,"<h2>Types of Flasks</h2><h3>Rectangular or Straight Hip Flasks</h3><p>Hip flask in a rectangular shape are the second most common type of flasks. It has to be noted that a fully rectangular flask is somewhat hard to find. Most flasks are curved even if it is for a subtle angle. Rectangular flasks, however, do exist. They come with the big upside that they are are of ultimately flat proportions and will fit into any pocket neatlessly.</p><h3>Kidney Hip Flasks</h3><p>Named ""kidney"" after their kidney-inspired vault the kidney hip flask is the most common type of shapes. It comes in varying degrees of curvature than range from a very mild bulge to the full classic curtosis. While the degree of the vault makes no difference to how much a flask can hold, a stable curve in your flask comes with this upside: it just looks the most authentic.</p><h3>Round or Oval Hip Flasks</h3><p>Round or ovally shaped flasks mostly come with a below-average volume of alcohol to carrry with them. Often this type of flask is prefered by women as the roundedness of the flask portrays a more female style. Especially so, if you compare it to the sharp and masculine edges of a rectangular flask.</p>"
minimalist wallets,"<h2>Types of Minimalist Wallets</h2><h3>Slim wallets</h3><p>Slim wallets take traditional wallet design and reduce weight and bulk by removing layers and taking advantage of thinner materials. You'll still get the fold-open design you're used to, just in a more manageable size. Expect to get a large pocket for cash, several dividers for credit cards, and a place for your ID.</p><h3>Truly minimalist wallets</h3><p>Real minimalist wallets forego conventional design and ditch the bulky exterior. What they're left with is a single layer that can hold several cards and a few folded bills. They often use thinner materials like lightweight leather, textiles, or even aluminum and carbon fiber. They hold everything in place just as well as your old wallet, but they need a lot less space in your pocket to do so.</p><h3>Money clips</h3><p>Money clips are the simplest and thinnest way to keep track of your cards and cash. No pockets, no dividers, just a firm grip to hold a stack of necessities together. Some leave your items exposed, but others act as a pair of bookends that tightly sandwich your ID, credit cards, and spending money to offer a little more protection. This is a great way to go if you don't mind digging through a stack of cards to find the one you need.</p>"
iwb holsters,"<h2>Types of IWB Holsters</h2><p>There are a wide range of IWB holsters. In fact, there are innumerable combinations, but they're often categorized by where they're meant to be worn and construction material. You'll commonly hear terms like strong side, appendix, Kydex, and hybrid. In this section, I'll cover what they mean.</p><h3>Strongside carry</h3><p>Strongside carry means carrying your handgun on the side closest to your dominant hand. Since it is literally within grasp, you'll have a quicker time drawing and presenting your firearm. The opposite is weak-side carry, which would require you to reach across your body to draw your gun. Most instructors and professionals do not recommend weak-side carry.</p><h3>Appendix carry</h3><p>Appendix carry means positioning your holster by your appendix, which is in the lower right side of your abdomen, or usually to the right of your belt buckle. For many, it is an easy place to conceal a firearm and a more natural place to draw from. </p><p>There are two common types of appendix holsters. The first is simple in that it will only hold a firearm whereas the second type contains a sidecar capable of fitting a magazine and/or a knife. The latter can complicate things because it'll take up more space, meaning it'll be less comfortable.</p><h3>Kydex holsters</h3><p>Kydex is a trademarked polymer blend used for a range of applications, but in the gun world, it's used to make holsters. Compared to traditional holster material like leather, Kydex is durable, lightweight, and won't wear on your handgun.</p><h3>Hybrid holsters</h3><p>Common hybrid holsters consist of Kydex and another material. The main benefit of wearing a hybrid holster is comfort. The exterior material, whether it's leather or nylon, is significantly more comfortable than raw Kydex, but you'll still get Kydex performance.</p><p>The drawback to a hybrid is that leather and nylon absorb moisture and will wear out over time. Therefore, the best hybrid holsters use a three-fourths Kydex shell, to specifically protect the trigger area, and contain softer material in areas that touch your body.</p>"
hydration bladders,"<h2>Types of Hydration Packs</h2><p>There are two general types of hydration packs: hydration backpacks and hydration waistpacks. Within those groups, there are packs made specifically for different outdoor activities, including hiking, running, mountain biking, cycling, skiing and snowboarding. The common feature among nearly all of them is the included hydration reservoir that makes drinking easy. A handful of packs (usually ones designed for running) include water bottles rather than a reservoir.</p><h3>Hydration Backpacks</h3><p>These packs are a lot like standard packs for hiking and usually feature ample cargo space for food, extra layers and the ten essentials that you should carry on every outing. They range in size from small packs for short hikes to ones that are big enough for ultralight overnight backpacking.</p><h3>Cycling Hydration Pack</h3><p>These packs are designed specifically for road cycling and mountain biking. Those designed for the road are typically compact and low-profile so they feel light and stable on your back and won't create a ton of wind resistance. Packs designed for mountain biking are often a bit larger to accommodate extra gear, cycling clothing and bike tools. All cycling hydration packs typically have low-profile waistbelts that won't interfere with your pedaling.</p><h3>Running hydration packs</h3><p>These are designed specifically for running. While shopping, you'll notice that some are called running vests, while others are running backpacks. The line between the two is sometimes blurry.</p><h3>Hydration Waistpacks</h3><p>As the name implies, hydration waistpacks are carried around your waist. Many of them include water bottles rather than a reservoir, and the cargo space is smaller than most packs provide.</p><p>Waistpacks can be nice for light and fast adventures, like a hike, trail run or cross-country ski, where you don't need to carry much gear and you don't want your movement hindered by a bigger pack on your back.</p>"
hiking shorts,"<h2>Types of hiking shorts</h2><p>What you intend to use your shorts for will greatly dictate the pair you should buy. There are three main types of hiking shorts, each of which is designed for a specific type of hiking:</p><h3>Traditional Shorts</h3><p>A traditional pair of hiking shorts is generally made from thicker nylon fabric. They usually have lots of cargo-style pockets and a longer inseam for added protection from the elements. Often, traditional shorts will be made with a UPF fabric and have a DWR coating.</p><h3>Lifestyle Shorts</h3><p>Many outdoor gear manufacturers have started making hiking shorts that are stylish enough to be worn around town. These shorts have many of the features that you see on traditional models, but usually don't have bulky cargo pockets.</p><h3>Athletic Shorts</h3><p>As the name suggests, athletic shorts are very similar to what you d wear for a run or a workout session in the gym. These shorts are lightweight, highly breathable, and quick-drying. But, they usually don't have many pockets, so they are not the most functional option for longer backpacking trips.</p>"
drop leg holsters,"<h2>Types of drop leg holsters</h2><p>Since drop leg holster is one of the many holster types out in the market, there is no specific type of it. In this guide to help you select the best option for you we classified it with the materials that comes with the drop leg holsters.</p><h3>Metal holsters</h3><p>Metal holsters are typically constructed of stainless steel, carbon steel, or aluminum. These materials are heavier and can get hot if left unshielded, but they are also incredibly durable. Thi types of holster are usually made as adaptors to othre type of holster.</p><h3>Polymer and Kydex blend holsters</h3><p>Kydex is a brand of polymer, or plastic, that manufacturers can mold to extremely precise specs. Durable Kydex and other polymer blend holsters are pretty much maintenance-free and only require a wipe-down when you get them dirty.</p><p>Holsters made from Kydex and other polymers don't lose their shape, even after years of use.There's no ""break-in"" period for polymer holsters like there is with leather although you can mold Kydex to the specific shape of your gun by adding a little heat. Kydex is extremely lightweight and less expensive than leather.</p><p>The cons of this kind is that drawing your gun from a plastic or Kydex holster can be noisier than drawing from leather or nylon. Kydex can wear against the finish on your gun, particularly around edges and corners.</p><h3>Leather holsters</h3><p>Leather holsters were good enough for the rest of the west, and they're still good enough for many people. Because leather is so tough and resilient, it's been the standard for generations.</p><p>Leather holsters are flexible and comfortable, and they form to your body over time and drawing your gun from leather is quiet. However, leather can be pricy and leather degrades and provides less support over time and you can sweat through a leather holster.</p><h3>Nylon Holsters</h3><p>Nylon holsters can be incredibly durable. In many cases, these types of holsters are equipped with a shape-retaining stiffener and hook-and-loop fasteners so you can customize the way you carry.</p><p>Usually the cheapest option and drawing from a nylon holster pouch can be whisper-quiet.Nylon holsters are considered more universal because they are usually not molded for a particular firearm. However it may not last as long as other options and less structure often means less security and structural integrity.</p>"
dive watches under 500,"<h2>Types of dive watches</h2><p>In this section we categorize dive watches based on their display and movement. Under display, it can be either analog or digital. Most watches use mechanical technology, referred to as a movement, that include intricate components like gears and springs to keep the watch ticking.</p><h3>Analog watches</h3><p>Analogue watches have a mechanism to indicate time by means of mechanical structures, such as a dial and hands (hand indication type).Analog watches are ideal for elegant appearances in social events of any kind and there are far more designs to choose from for analogs.</p><p>Analog diving watches will often feature a rotating bezel, that allows for an easier reading of elapsed time of under one hour from a specific point. This is used to compute the length of a dive.</p><h3>Digital watches</h3><p>Digital watches have a mechanism to indicate time by means of electronic structures, such as a liquid crystal and LED (number display type). They use a battery that should be replaced every few months. Digital watches are more accurate than mechanical watches.</p><p>Digital dive watches usually perform the elapsed time function by use of a standard stop watch function. Digital dive watches may also feature a depth gauge and logging features, but are not usually regarded as a substitute for a dedicated dive computer.</p>"
hiking backpacks,"<h2>Types of hiking backpacks</h2><p>Hiking backpacks can be divided into three types; frameless backpacks, internal-frame backpacks and external-frame backpacks. Below is a short description of each type.</p><h3>Frameless Backpacks</h3><p>Frameless backpacks have a flexible construction and are thus very light (they don't contain heavy aluminum rods or plastic framesheets). A high-quality frameless backpack with a volume of 40 liters can weigh as little as 600 grams. The downside of frameless backpacks is that they don't transfer the weight from the shoulders to the hips (via the hip belt) efficiently because a rigid construction is required for this. Therefore, they are not suitable for carrying heavy loads and typically also don't have a capacity of more than 40 liters. Nevertheless, frameless backpacks are very useful for day hikes and fast lightweight alpine ascents, exactly because of their low weight.</p><h3>Internal-frame Backpacks</h3><p>Internal-frame backpacks have a rigid or semi-rigid construction as they use flat aluminum rods or plastic framesheets; the former runs vertically behind the backpacks back panel and prevents the backpack from collapsing. The rigid construction enables the weight of the backpack to be efficiently transferred from the shoulders to the hips (via the hip belt), which increases your performance as the hips are supported by larger muscle groups than the shoulders. However, the rigid structure adds some weight to the backpack and thus internal-frame backpacks are typically heavier than frameless backpacks.</p><h3>External-Frame Backpacks</h3><p>External-frame backpacks are nowadays rarely used for hiking as they are heavier, bulkier and less travel-friendly than the other two types of backpacks. An external-frame backpack consists of a harness (shoulder straps and a hip belt), aluminum frame and a pack. The aluminum frame is completely rigid in order to provide good load support.</p>"
hiking poles,"<h2>Types of hiking poles</h2><p>Trekking poles can be broken into four primary types: Standard, Foldable trekking poles, Shock Absorbing, and Staff. The one that's right for you comes down to what type of terrain you expect to be traversing.</p><h3>Standard (Telescopic trekking poles)</h3><p>Standard trekking poles are typically strong, lightweight, and telescoping. The telescoping feature is essential for any hiking or backpacking uses, when you want to strap your poles to your pack and go hands-free. There are two types of pole adjustment locking mechanisms. There are lever locks, and there are twist locks.</p><p>Twist locks are not recommended for skiing or snowshoeing because it can be difficult to adjust them with gloves on. Lever locks are intended for all-around use. You can also find standard poles in both two and three sections. Two sectioned-poles are generally sturdier and better for skiing, while three sectioned poles are best intended for hiking o backpacking.</p><h3>Foldable trekking poles</h3><p>Folding trekking poles come in sections that pull apart from one another and fold up, much like tent poles. Because of this, they often have a narrow shaft which helps shed weight. They also collapse down significantly shorter than telescoping poles (some models up to 10 inches shorter), making them easy to throw in a travel bag or strap to your backpack when not in use.</p><p>Because of their light weight and packability, folding trekking polesare preferred among ultralight enthusiasts, thru-hikers, trail runners, and climbers. However, keep in mind that folding poles generally cannot bear as much weight as telescoping models and offer only a short range of adjustment.</p><h3>Shock Absorbing</h3><p>Shock absorbing poles have internal air pistons that compress coiled springs. They add weight and cost, but they do help alleviate extra stress on your joints, especially on the knees and ankles. The spring on most shock absorbing trekking poles can be locked so it can transform into a traditional rigid pole when needed.</p><h3>Staff</h3><p>A hiking staff is a single pole and it's an old tradition. They are typically taller than most other trekking poles and they offer stability while not occupying both hands. They're very useful for casual walking, but can also be exceptionally useful when fording rivers or when walking down steep terrain that requires large steps over boulders. Some staffs can also serve as a center pole for lightweight tent setups on backpacking trips or provide the hiker with a stable monopod for taking photos.</p>"
binoculars for hunting,"<h2>Types of hunting binoculars</h2><h3>Roof prism binoculars</h3><p>Binoculars aren't just about the lenses. Each set of binoculars contains a set of prisms whose primary function is to invert the image collected by the concave lenses, therefore returning it to be ""right-side-up"" before delivering it to the user's eye. The roof prism type contains prisms within the binoculars that are set in a straight line or overlapping fashion. This allows the objective lenses to be directly in line with the eyepieces and means the binoculars can be built with a more compact, linear design. Roof prism binoculars have become the most popular in the field of hunting, purely because of its ease of carry and more compact build.</p><h3>Porro prism binoculars</h3><p>The Porro prism type contains two prisms offset from one another, which means the objective lenses are set wider than the eyepieces, making these binoculars bulkier and cumbersome. Without a doubt, the Porro prism type binoculars offer better optical qualities and brighter/clearer images, but there's just no getting around the practicality of the roof prism binos when it comes to hunting.</p><h3>Compact binoculars</h3><p>Compact binoculars are certainly great when it comes to reducing weight in your pack or around your neck, and there are many great pairs that can fit most of your hunting needs. The thing with compact binoculars is that when you make the trade-off for a smaller size, you're usually looking at small objective lenses (somewhere around the 25mm range is typical). Having smaller objective lenses isn't the end of the world, but it does mean that less light will be collected and your overall image will be less bright and vivid.</p><h3>Long-range binoculars</h3><p>With long-range binoculars, you're usually going to go the opposite way with size. Longer ranges usually require higher magnification and larger objective lenses (12x magnification and up and usually 50mm diameter objective lenses). While these can be great when you're poring over valleys from a high peak, you'll probably want a tripod of some sort to get the best result. Most long-range binoculars are equipped to handle a tripod attachment, so there shouldn't be any issue there.</p><h3>Low-light binoculars</h3><p>Low-light binoculars tend to incorporate a lot of other subtypes because there are several different methods for improving light transmission within a set of binos. For instance, many types of Porro prism binos are considered low-light binoculars simply because their prism structure is specifically designed to maximize light transmission.</p><p>Other binoculars could be considered low-light binoculars due to the size of their objective lenses and even further due to complex, and often proprietary, lens coatings that are specifically engineered to maximize light transmission.</p>"
rucking backpacks,"<h2>Types of rucking backpacks</h2><p>There are many options when it comes to rucking backpacks. The key is finding the right fit for your needs.</p><h3>Framed</h3><p>A backpack frame is a must if you plan to carry a heavy load (more than 45 pounds). Frames are designed to distribute weight more evenly, so it doesn't all rest on your shoulders and lower back, and they're often equipped with other features like ventilation.</p><p>They're typically made from lightweight material (aluminum or plastic), and come in different shapes (flat or contoured), which you'd pick based on your gear and preferences.</p><h3>Frameless</h3><p>If your rucking backpack doesn't have a frame, you essentially have a normal backpack, so be cautious about the weight of your load-out. You could comfortably carry a load of less than 45 pounds with a frameless bag. If you go heavier than that, you risk straining your shoulders and back.</p>"
fleece jackets,"<h2>Types of fleece jackets</h2><h3>Lightweight</h3><p>Lightweight fleece jackets are typically made from 100 weight Polartec and are sometimes referred to as R1 jackets. They are the most breathable and packable and offer moderate warmth. The 100 series jackets are typically designed for high output efforts like trail running, cross country skiing, and mountain biking.</p><h3>Midweight</h3><p>Midweight fleece jackets are typically made from 200 weight Polartec and are also called mid-layers. They can be worn as a jacket during cool temperatures or as an insulating layer over a base layer and under a windproof shell during colder temps. They are the most versatile of the bunch.</p><h3>Heavyweight</h3><p>Heavyweight fleece jackets are typically made from 300 (or greater) weight Polartec and are the warmest but also the least breathable. You don't see as many 300 or 400 weight jackets on the market anymore, as most people opt for lightweight down jackets or soft shells in lieu of these bulky and baggy outer layers.</p>"
rain boots,"<h2>Types of rain boots</h2><p>Rain boots come in all shapes and sizes. There's a good chance you already have one, but it's worth checking to make sure you're getting the most bang for your buck. If you're looking for something new, there are plenty of options out there that fit the bill. We've rounded up some of our favorites below.</p><h3>Low/Casual Boots</h3><p>If you want dry feet but don't think you'll constantly be slogging through water and muck, casual low rain boots are a great option. Compared to more intense work boots, casual rain boots typically don't come as tall, weigh as much, or provide the same amount of grip underfoot.</p><p>Casual rain boots generally don't feature much insulation and are better suited for puddles and urban errands than mucky fields and freezing creeks. And they're typically not built for all-day comfort (though this isn't always the case). When we're working on farms, no one is wearing a casual boot, except for the occasional trip to town or in the evenings.</p><h3>Mid-height Boots</h3><p>Mid-height boots split the difference between casual and full-scale work boots and subsequently are generally mid-weight, mid-stiff, and semi-rugged. They are typically mid-calf height. You could do hard labor in these, but you might not love them if this is your main goal.</p><h3>Work Boots</h3><p>Work boots have higher shafts, better traction, (generally) more comfortable insoles for longer workdays, and weigh more because of these features. We used these when bushwhacking to climbing crags, kicking around rivers while car camping, and wading through knee-deep snow on trips to the mountains. All work boots are solid, but each will be geared towards a different type of work, depending on which features they have</p>"
rooftop tents,"<h2>Types of rooftop tents</h2><p>There are two categories to consider when shopping for a rooftop tent. There are two general types of rooftop tents: hard shell or soft shell, which vary based on the materials used to make the tent and how they are constructed. Each category has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Soft-shell tents</h3><p>Soft-shell tents are constructed with a hefty waterproof soft cover attached to the floor platform, and fold out beyond the edges of your vehicle's roof. Poles and hinges hold it in place when in camping mode. Soft-shell tents usually have removable covers that protect the tent while in travel mode. The tent body, usually made of canvas or nylon, is attached to the entire platform and sets up with the help of internal hinges and manually placed poles. These covers usually attach via velcro or straps and buckles. Some soft-shell covers can be cumbersome and awkward to stow between uses.</p><p>The most obvious advantage here is price, however, when held up against hardshell models, the downsides are clear. First and foremost, the soft coverings are much more prone to moisture buildup when stored, resulting in a shorter lifespan. Additionally, without the stability of a hard cover, softshell tents are often noisier in the wind, both when opened and packed away. Finally, expect a softshell to take significantly longer to set up and take down, similar to a ground tent.</p><h3>Hard-shell tents</h3><p>Hard-shell tents feature a fiberglass, plastic, or aluminum shell that opens and closes, clamshell style. This shell also doubles as the cover when the tent is in travel mode. The tent canopy folds down inside when closed. Most hard-shell tents do not have a larger footprint than the roof they sit upon which doesn't affect their compatibility - it just means that hard shell tents, in general, have a smaller inner area than soft-shell ones. Most open either on a hinge or pop up on all sides like a box. The majority of hardshells keep their footprint to the vehicle's roof area, but a few fold out, increasing the floor area and allowing you to add on extras like an awning.</p><p>Hardshell tents are significantly more expensive and heavier than softshells, and many feature smaller floorplans. However, their longer lifespan, added convenience, and superior protection are well worth it for many. During transport, hardshell tents also are more aerodynamic, completely waterproof (mold is less of a concern), and protective against low-hanging branches and flying debris.</p>"
hiking pants for men,"<h2>Types of hiking pants</h2><p>There are several different types of hiking pants on the market, and it's important to know which is best for you. Like selecting the perfect pair of shoes or backpack for hiking, your protection and freedom of movement are critical when selecting the appropriate pair of pants for your next hiking trip.</p><h3>Traditional Hiking Pants</h3><p>Traditional hiking plants are straight-leg model pants fantastic for hiking as they protect your legs from rock and thorn abrasions, nasty bug bites, sun, rain, and wind exposure. In addition, they keep your legs warmer than shorts. On the plus side, traditional hiking plants are suitable to wear in town as they offer a slight ""outdoor look"" making them perfect for home, on the trails, and in town. However, they are more durable and breathable than regular streetwear pants. However, on the downside, conventional hiking pants aren't versatile. So, you'll have to consider bringing a pair of shorts along for the hike if the weather changes.</p><h3>Roll-Up Hiking Pants</h3><p>As a similar alternative to traditional pants, roll-up models have buttons on the lower leg or an elastic in the cuff of the hiking pants. Both features allow you to roll up the pants into a higher capris style. The roll-up feature offers some relief to hot temperatures without the hassle of changing pants mid-activity. Although you can roll up the traditional hiking pants, the formalized feature ensures that the lifted legs stay rolled up for as long as you choose.</p><h3>Convertible Hiking Pants</h3><p>Convertible hiking pants tend to have a zipper around each leg, usually located right above the knees, allowing you to unzip and remove the lower piece of the pant leg whenever the temperatures get too balmy for full-leg coverage. Benefit of convertible hiking pants that many hikers forget to consider is the simplicity of washing the pant legs without removing the whole pair of pants. A slight downer to convertible hiking pants is that you'll have to remove your hiking boots to get the leg off, and the zips can potentially chafe you.In addition, for individuals looking for a fashionable pair of hiking pants to wear to other places, the visible seam and zips running across your thigh might not be your favorite fashion statement.</p><h3>Softshell Hiking Pants</h3><p>Softshell hiking pants consist of a high-performance synthetic fabric with two to three layers; they are resistant to tears and abrasions, holding up well to mountainous or rugged terrain. Softshell hiking pants are the perfect choice for someone looking for a balance between breathability and water resistance. Softshell pants aren't suitable for all climates; they are best for winter hikes or unstable environments with rapidly changing altitudes. In addition, softshell pants are pricy compared to non-softshell hiking pants.</p>"
night vision goggles,"<h2>Types of night vision goggles</h2><p>Night vision goggles come in all kinds of different configurations. Some are designed for specific uses, such as hunting or military operations. The type you choose will depend on your needs. We'll break down the most common options below.</p><h3>Infrared Night Vision Goggles</h3><p>Infrared-based night vision goggles rely on the light outside of the visible spectrum range to illuminate the images you're seeing in low light conditions. A common option is green light waves, which is why many night vision goggles rely on green phosphor.</p><p>However, these types of night vision goggles cannot work in complete darkness or when it is bright outside. Without any ligh, even if not on the visible spectrum, it's impossible to create an image for you to see. And bright light will damage the technology and make the goggles inoperable.</p><h3>Thermal Night Vision Goggles</h3><p>As opposed to infrared technology, thermal technology relies on temperature and heat detection to create an image. The image isn't as clear as with infrared night vision goggles.</p><p>These types of visual displays don't rely on light and can work in complete darkness - even in the absence of light outside of the visible spectrum. If you're considering a pair of night vision goggles for hunting in total darkness, thermal-based models are the best option.</p><h3>Digital Night Vision</h3><p>The digital night vision is the least known type of all in the consumer market. As implied by the name, these devices use digital CCD (charge-coupled devices) or SMOS (complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensors, similar to those in your digital camera.</p><p>Because the CCD and CMOS sensors have sensitivity in the Near Infrared spectrum, up to 1.1 micro m, they are used in Digital Night Vision devices. This type of night vision offers several advantages: Their digital sensor is resistant to damage from bright light, also do not burn out easily and have a virtually unlimited lifetime and are less fragile and less expensive. In addition to all of the above, digital night vision is inherently easier to integrate with digital media recording and storage and eaasy to use.</p>"
pocket knives,"<h2>Types of pocket knives</h2><p>Another thing to consider are type when picking out a pocket knife that suits your intended use for the knife, we classify them according to their blade shape. There is a wide variety of blade profiles that range from ""pretty good at most thing"" to ""extremely specialized.""</p><h3>Clip Point</h3><p>Often also called a Bowie. All Bowies are clip points; not all clip points are Bowies! It features a portion of straight spine that transitions into a concave curve to the tip, and compared to a Drop Point it has a finer tip, which is better for fine piercing work, but easier to break.</p><h3>Drop Point</h3><p>The Drop Point blade shape was popularized by Bob Loveless, and it's the standard go-to for a pocketknife. It's defined by a gentle curved slope on the spine to the tip, and a more pronounced continuous curve on the sharpened edge. This is the ""do anything"" of blade shapes, adept at roll cuts (like cutting food) as well as piercing/jabbing or digging thanks to a sturdy tip.</p><h3>Sheepsfoot</h3><p>Similar to a Wharncliffe, but a Sheepsfoot blade has a rounded profile as the spine approaches the tip, and usually a straight sharpened edge. The rounded tip is to avoid accidentally piercing what you're cutting, which makes these a favorite of first responders. These aren't good at piercing cuts.</p><h3>Wharncliffe</h3><p>The Wharncliffe style is identified by its straight (or nearly straight) sharpened edge, and a less rounded spine profile than the Sheepsfoot, giving it a more piercing-capable tip. Great for utility work.</p><h3>Tanto</h3><p>A Tanto blade has two separate cutting edges, with the forward portion of the blade angling upwards towards the tip. This allows it to pierce objects in a thrusting motion (with the large sharpened area) but is much less adept at fine detail work. There are two styles: a Japanese style tanto has a smooth transition to the leading edge, while an American tanto has a sharp corner between the two edges.</p><h3>Spear point</h3><p>A spear point is very similar to a Dagger grind, but features a false edge on the backside and sometimes has slight asymmetry. These are more common on folding knives as there isn't a sharp edge protruding when closed.</p><h3>Recurve</h3><p>This describes the shape of a sharpened edge on a knife and can be applied to various blade shapes. A recurve means that instead of a single convex curve from the ricasso to the tip, at some point along the blade the sharpened edge transitions from convex to concave. This effectively inreases the amount of cutting area versus blade length as well as provides a ""well"" to pull materials like rope into when pull-cutting. It's also a pain to sharpen.</p><h3>Dagger</h3><p>A dagger grind is fully symmetrical, the point level with the centerline of the blade, and sharpened on both sides. This is used as a combat knife. Usually found on fixed blades or out the front knives as it would be very impractical on a folder.</p><h3>Spear Point</h3><p>a spear point is very similar to a Dagger grind, but features a false edge on the backside and sometimes has slight asymmetry. These are more common on folding knives as there isn't a sharp edge protruding when closed.</p>"
hiking boots,"<h2>Types of hiking boots</h2><p>Hiking boots are commonly categorized into three groups and they are based according to their weight, ankle stability, and the foot support provided. This classification system is a helpful starting point to find the appropriate type of boot for your hiking needs.</p><h3>Lightweight Hikers</h3><p>Made from almost entirely synthetic fabrics, these boots generally have lower ankle heights, do not use a rigid shank for torsional stability, and have thinner fabric uppers that may include quite a lot of mesh in order to shave weight.</p><p>The lightweight boot category now stretches to include the ultralight ""fastpacking"" style boots which may look and feel like a slightly taller trail running shoe, to the cusp of the midweight category where we find beefier soles, more ankle support, and thicker, more durable materials. Lightweight hiking boots are best suited for a lighter pack weight, or for those who typically hike in a hiking shoe but would prefer a bit more support.</p><h3>Midweight Hikers</h3><p>These have more substantial construction: higher ankle collars, burlier midsoles and shanks, and heavier, more durable uppers, often all leather. More than the traditional backpacking boot, these models provide increased ankle stability and foot support for carrying loads and traveling rough terrain</p><h3>Heavyweight Hikers</h3><p>These boots are much heavier, much more durable, and supremely waterproof. Full-grain leather uppers, paired with burly TPU midsoles that focus on support rather than lightweight cushioning, create boots that handle the roughest terrain. As backpacking gear continues to get lighter and lighter, the utility of heavyweight hikers is diminishing.</p><p>Those who are looking for a hiking boot that can double as a work boot for applications such as working on a trail crew may still find the benefit in this increase in bulk and weight, as this will indeed provide more foot protection.</p>"
range bags,"<h2>Types of range bags</h2><p>Range bags come in many different sizes and styles. The most common are the large, rectangular ones with a capacity of at least five pounds. So choose a bag that can hold everything in a secure, protected way. Every range bag is designed for a specific type of shooting, so make sure you buy one that's right for you.</p><h3>Backpack range bags</h3><p>They're small enough to fit inside a single compartment backpack, but large enough to fit multiple containers. These range bags are great for storing ammunition or cleaning supplies.</p><p>This type of range bag is practical, offers generous amounts of space, and keeps our hands free. They're great for situations where you have separate cases for your firearms or are moving between dispersed firing positions.</p><p>Most backpacks built for the range include easy-access compartments for handguns. Some come with soft cases for individual handguns so you can easily grab the one you want. Storage for long guns is less common, although there are rifle cases that can be worn like a backpack.</p><h3>Soft cases</h3><p>The most accessible range bags are essentially soft pistol cases with dedicated storage for small items like magazines, earplugs, and maybe a very compact cleaning kit. They're great for a pistol session at a range where targets are provided but fall short when you start adding multiple firearms and larger items.</p><p>Compared to hard cases, these are lighter, more affordable, and typically accommodate pouch attachments. The drawback is that soft cases don't offer the same level of protection as hard cases. They leave your gear susceptible to impacts and are less secure than a locked hard case.</p><h3>Duffel bags</h3><p>These are the one-stop-shops of range bags. Throw your ammunition, cleaning gear, ear and eye protection, targets, stapler, extra magazines, range book, and even pistol cases in a duffel, and be on your way. Some even have room for disassembled long guns. If you want to make one purchase and be done with it, this is the style of range bag for you.</p><p>With this much space, it's easy to get carried away and pack more weight than you really want to lug around. Throwing a bunch of weight on one shoulder isn't the most efficient way to distribute weight on your body, so be mindful when you choose your loadout for the day.</p>"
utility knives,"<h2>Types of utility knives</h2><p>There are four main types of utility knives you need to know about. Each has its place, but you need to be aware of the differences before you make a purchase.</p><h3>Retractable Knives</h3><p>These knives are the most common utility variety and feature a sliding blade mechanism with variable depth. Actuation is typically through a button that is depressed with the thumb to expose the knife and control the depth of the blade.</p><p>Most retractable knives can accept multiple blade types. Simple versions feature a straight handle and some kind of screw to separate the device and load spare blades, while advanced models may be more ergonomic in shape and offer quick-release blade changes.</p><h3>Fixed-Blade Knives</h3><p>These knives are perfect for heavy-duty use and precision cuts. Since the blade gets locked into a single position, the knife experiences no blade slop or side-to-side wiggle which is common in standard retractable knives. Since the blade doesn't retract, it's important to carefully store these knives or even remove the blades when not in use.</p><p>These knives are most commonly found in the carpeting industry and they can typically accept many different types of blades. Apart from the common full-sized knife, certain hobby knives are also fixed-blade in design and can support ultra-sharp blades of various sizes and shapes that are used for precision cuts.</p><h3>Safety Knives</h3><p>Some safety knives auto-retract or force you to squeeze a trigger to extend the blade. OSHA requires these tools on certain jobsites in order to meet various safety standards.</p><p>Most users dislike using them as they violate every rule of ergonomics. However, when you have to use them, make sure you grab one that helps you work as efficiently as possible.</p><h3>Snap-Off Blade Knives</h3><p>Snap-off blade knives feature segmented blades that are broken off in sections to deliver a brand new edge once the old one is too dull to be useful.</p><p>They let you continue cutting without the need for a blade change. These knives started out catering to hobbyists where heavy-duty use wasn't required.</p>"
rifle scopes,"<h2>Types of rifle scopes</h2><p>There are four basic types of rifle scopes, each with its own unique set of features.</p><h3>Variable scopes</h3><p>Variable scopes serve the most basic purpose for rifle shooting. They allow you to increase or decrease the magnification of your target so you can see it at various distances. The technology relies on using a large objective lens to magnify your target.</p><p>In turn, you'll be able to see farther away with a larger lens, but the scope will be bigger and heavier as well.</p><p>Variable scopes are extremely common for shooters of all skill levels, but they're preferred for precision and long-range shooting. Because they're designed to magnify far-away targets, they're a poor choice for close-range shooting.</p><h3>LPVO</h3><p>A low-powered variable optic, or LPVO, is designed for close- and mid-range shooting. The magnification setting starts at 1x or 1.55x, meaning there's little to no magnification of your natural sight, but LPVOs are available for up to 10x magnification.</p><p>LPVOs are also equipped with an illuminated reticle, which gives you an easier time seeing at close range. While not as effective as a red dot, it's pretty dang close. Nonetheless, an LPVO's reticle works without illumination as well.</p><p>LPVOs are one of the more versatile types of optics. They can be used for tactical applications, hunting, competitive shooting, and much more.</p><h3>Night optics</h3><p>There are two types of night optics: night vision and thermal. The differences between them are significant in terms of technology and price, but comparing the two is like comparing apples to oranges. They're both great options for nighttime shooting activities.</p><ul><li>A night vision optic amplifies ambient light, so you can see in low light conditions. It reveals the world in hues of green or white, and you can see incredible detail in the imagery depending on the lighting conditions and range. However, too much light will wash out the image. Compared to thermal scopes, night vision costs less.</li><li>A thermal optic (infrared optic) highlights the heat signatures of the objects around you. Hotter objects appear brighter and colder objects appear darker. While you'll have an easier time identifying living objects, details are not always clear as night vision. However, thermal scopes capture infrared light, which cannot be detected by the human eye, so it'll work in daylight and absolute darkness. It tends to be more expensive than night vision.</li></ul><h3>Prism optics</h3><p>Prism optics are jack-of-all-trades optics. They're low-profile, rugged, and have simple controls. They have either no magnification or some magnification, but they're fixed power, so you can't increase or decrease magnification, which is their main drawback. Lastly, they have a very usable reticle that's often accompanied by illumination.</p>"
red dot sights,"<h2>Types of red dot sights</h2><p>Red dot sights come in many different shapes and sizes. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase. Here are some common types of red dot sights to help you narrow down your options.</p><h3>Miniature and micro red dot sights</h3><p>Miniature and micro red dot sights are small. Miniature sights like the RMR work well on pistols, as backup sights on magnified optics, and even as primary optics on some long guns. Micro red dot sights are almost entirely used with pistols.</p><p>These little optics have a very small window and are best used with a two-eyed, open shooting style. They often won't pair with magnifiers, and what you see is what you get. Their main benefits are small size and low weight.</p><h3>Compact red dots</h3><p>Compact red dots refer to red dots with an objective lens or window from 18mm to 25mm in size. They can be used with magnifiers and night vision devices. Compact red dots are often enclosed optics and can be tubular or square in shape. These optics are extremely reliable, and offer a smaller, lighter alternative for long-gun red dots.</p><h3>Full-sized red dots</h3><p>Full-sized red dots are often 25mm and higher. While they are falling out of favor slightly, they still have a place in the shooting sports. Full-sized red dots offer a massive window and a wide field of view. Plus, they pair very well with magnifiers and clip-on thermal or night vision optics. They are perfect for duty rifles because they're incredibly durable.</p>"
winter hiking boots,"<h2>Types of winter hiking boots</h2><p>Winter hiking boots come in many different sizes and materials. Winter hiking boots do have some degree of diversity worth exploring. Standard winter hiking boots tend to be warmer and heavier than the usual hiking boots, and those built for hunting and extremely colder temperature come with some additional features.</p><p>Before you spend your hard-earned money on a pair, make sure you know what you're getting into.</p><h3>Backpacking boots</h3><p>Backpacking may seem like an elite outdoor sport for some. Whatever the case, a reliable pair of winter backpacking boots is non-negotiable for that special breed of hiker. Predictably, winter backpacking boots are a breed all their own as well.</p><p>Easily the biggest difference between a traditional hiking boot and a backpacking boot is the extra ankle support found in the backpacker's footwear, although upgraded durability and toughness are equally as important.</p><p>While it may go without saying, winter backpacking boots demand all the same features as traditional backpacking boots but with the obvious need for insulation, waterproofing, and other winter-specific features.</p><h3>Hunting boots</h3><p>Traditionally, hiking and hunting boots have tended to fall into different categories, thanks to somewhat different user demographics. That said, when the rubber meets the gravel, the differences between boots designed for active winter hunts and those created for winter hikes are surprisingly minimal.</p><p>Due to their need to battle lower temps, hunting boots, like winter hikers, tend to pack on the ounces thanks to critical insulation layers, although both designs emphasize lightweight construction.</p><p>In terms of fit and feel, hunting boots may have slightly more flexible soles to provide better ground feel and a slightly warm insulation due to the generally slower pace of hunting.</p><h3>Extreme cold boots</h3><p>Winter hiking boots designed for the extreme cold may be your best option if you living in absurdly cold and rugged locales. These hikers combine critical hiking boots elements with the best snow boots have to offer for an extremely warm, go-anywhere hiker.</p><p>These boots are optimized a little more for use in the snow, but they still provide plenty of grip for rocks, gravel, and other significant terrain features. These boots boast some top-notch insulation, and many include extra sole thickness to increase underfoot insulation.</p><p>Of course, all these add-ons will increase the overall weight, but the tradeoff is warmth that will keep icicles off your toes.</p>"
waterproof backpacks,"<h2>Types of waterproof backpacks</h2><p>There are several waterproof backpack options available and they come in all shapes and sizes. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to know what you're looking for before making a purchase.</p><h3>Hiking packs</h3><p>Hiking and camping packs often come with a removable rain cover, but some packs are waterproof on their own.</p><p>Compared to other types of waterproof backpacks, these are much better at carrying extra weight. Ample padding and advanced suspension systems allow these hiking packs to distribute loads efficiently and comfortably.</p><p>If you live in or regularly visit an area that gets a lot of rainfall, a waterproof hiking pack can be a lot more convenient than relying on a removable rain cover to keep your clothes and gear dry.</p><h3>Day packs</h3><p>We consider most bags in the 20- to 30-liter ballpark to be a day pack. These are great for using as an everyday carry option, get home bag, or hiking pack for short day trips.</p><p>Waterproof day packs come with a zipper or roll-top design. Both are fine, although roll-tops tend to be more reliable when it comes to heavy rain.</p><p>Day packs might be the most varied type of waterproof backpack. We found some options that are meant to be fashionable around town, and others that are built to take a beating on the trail.</p><p>Pay attention to how each pack is built to make sure you get the organization and comfort features you need.</p><h3>Stuff sacks</h3><p>Sometimes you just need someplace dry to store your gear, and that's where waterproof stuff sacks come into play. These bags come in a wide range of sizes and are usually extremely durable. Look for features like thick, rubberized fabric, welded seams, and roll-top closure.</p><p>Because these bags prioritize waterproofing above accessibility, don't expect much in the way of external pockets and features. Shoulder straps tend to be very basic and bags usually only have one compartment - like a seabag.</p><p>This design isn't great for organizing gear or hauling it long distances, but it can hold quite a bit and achieve a much better degree of water resistance than other waterproof backpacks.</p>"
backpacking sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of backpacking sleeping bags</h2><p>There are many options when it comes to backpacking sleeping bags. The trick is finding the right fit for your needs and budget.</p><h3>Rectangular sleeping bag</h3><p>This is the most traditional type of sleeping bag and ideal for those who like lots of room when they sleep. The rectangular shape means that there is plenty of space for tossing and turning providing more comfort to nighttime wrigglers than tapered sleeping bags.</p><p>The extra space means that rectangular sleeping bags are not renowned for their insulating properties, and they also don't usually have a hood to keep in the warm air.</p><h3>Barrel-shaped sleeping bag</h3><p>For those looking for the comfort and space of a rectangular sleeping bag without compromising as much on warmth, barrel-shaped sleeping bags are a good option.</p><p>They have a tapered shoulder area and footbox to decrease some of the dead air in rectangular bags, and sometimes come to with a hood to further maximise on the insulating properties.</p><h3>Mummy sleeping bag</h3><p>These are designed to keep sleepers warm in colder conditions. Their shape is contoured to the body with a highly tapered footbox and leg area.</p><p>There is more width through the hips and shoulders, and further tapering above the shoulders to join a fitted hood that can be tightened with a drawcord.</p><p>Mummy sleeping bags excel at keeping you warm and cosy, and are usually much lighter to carry than rectangular and barrel-shaped sleeping bags.</p><h3>Double sleeping bag</h3><p>Double sleeping bags or two person sleeping bags are designed to comfortably fit two adults inside. If you love snuggling with your partner at night, or find a single sleeping bag restricting then double bags are ideal.</p><p>However, what warmth you may gain from the combined body heat of two people in one bag can often be lost due to the loose fit of some double sleeping bags letting in excess cold air.</p><h3>Elephants foot sleeping bag</h3><p>As one of the most specific types of sleepings bags around, the elephants foot is designed solely with low weight in mind that is ideal for minimalist backpackers and mountaineers. It's shape is tapered and highly fitted like a mummy sleeping bag, but there is no hood.</p><p>It is also slightly shorter than other types of sleeping bags and is dependent upon the sleeper wearing an insulated jacket to keep their top half and head warm.</p>"
sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of sleeping bags</h2><p>There are several different kinds of sleeping bags. Sleeping bags fall into three basic categories summer, three-season, and winter.</p><h3>Summer</h3><p>Summer bags or known as lightweight sleeping bags, as their name suggests, are designed for lightweight and maximum compressibility. They are suitable for temperatures of about 30F and higher.</p><p>They're lightweight because less insulation means less weight, and they pack down tiny often as small as a cantaloupe. Summer bags often have full-length zippers, which allow you to zip them almost completely open for ventilation or to use as a quilt when the night gets really steamy. Most summer bags are simple sacks without too many bells and whistles. You won't have much need for a hood or a draft collar.</p><h3>Three-Season</h3><p>The three-season sleeping bag is the ""workhorse"" bag. It's the most popular bag and has the most versatility. Because of their popularity, three-season bags vary in quality, from miserable to outstanding.</p><p>Ideal for temperatures of about 20F and above, these bags are best suited for spring and fall trips, as well as summers in the high mountains when temps can dip below freezing at night. Good three-season bags have added features to combat colder temperatures like cinch-able hoods, draft collars, and zipper draft tubes.</p><h3>Winter</h3><p>These puffy cocoons, good for about 20F and below, have all the features of a three- season bag such as cinch-able hoods, draft collars, zipper draft tubes, but are beefed up with more insulation. By having a warm sleeping bag for winter camping, a person reduces the possibility of a sudden weather turn impacting a camping trip or threatening safety.</p><p>For winter camping, by far the most popular and effective sleeping bag insulation type is goose down. Goose down insulation provides excellent warmth with good compressibility, allowing for easier packing. Unlike summer camping, in winter camping there's little threat of a sleeping bag becoming soaked with water. Winter bags are always bulky to pack, so you'll want to buy a good compression stuff sack to help you tame it.</p>"
shooting ear protection,"<h2>Types of shooting ear protection</h2><p>Shooting ear protection comes in a variety of different styles, and it's important to know what you're getting into before you make your final purchase. Shooting ear protection can be categorized by the type of hearing protection used. These include foam earplugs, semi-insert earplugs, and insertable earmuffs. There are several different styles of ear protection that can help you become a better shooter.</p><h3>Unpowered earplugs</h3><p>Are the most commonly used type of ear protection. They consist of a piece of foam thats shaped like a half-dome with a flat edge that sits inside your ear. The foam expands when it comes into contact with air, pushing against the walls of your ear. This action reduces the amount of noise that makes its way into your head.</p><p>Earplugs for use during shooting come in a variety of types, making it best to consult a professional for the right solution. Types include:</p><ul><li>Custom:This is ideal for the professional shooter or hunter who needs high-quality, secure, comfortable protection. Customized plugs comprise an actual mold of your ear canal taken by a hearing professional.</li><li>Reusable shooter earplugs: These plugs come in either the most commonly known foam material, moldable putty-like material, or a more structured silicone.</li></ul><p>Additionally, many shooters prefer these because they do not disrupt your cheek weld at all when shouldering a rifle. Unfortunately, these have issues with coming loose or popping out for some people and can get lost easily due to their small size.</p><h3>Unpowered earmuffs</h3><p>Are another type of full-insert earplug. Unlike standard foam earplugs, these muffs have a flexible band that wraps around the top of your head to hold them in place. This allows you to move your head without removing the muffs, which can be helpful for looking around a dangerous area.</p><p>Unpowered earmuff-type hearing protection provides a more secure level of hearing protection than unpowered earplugs. They're quicker and easier to take on and off and require none of the fidgeting needed to stick earplugs in.</p><h3>Powered in-ear</h3><p>Powered in-ear hearing protection is an option for people who hate sweaty ears. They allow you to be aware of your surroundings without having to use cumbersome earmuffs. In general, these will be more expensive, due to the smaller circuitry needed features.</p><p>Additionally, many have higher noise reduction rates than powered over-the-ear headsets, due to their use of multi-flanged or other specialized ear tips, which allow them to physically block sound better. They offer the same ease of use as unpowered earplugs but also the same drawbacks.</p><h3>Powered over-the-ear</h3><p>Powered over-the-ear hearing protection is what most people think of when they think of powered hearing protection. They offer auditory situational awareness while offering much the same fit as conventional earmuffs.</p><p>They're generally the go-to option for communication headsets as well, offering both hearing protection and a convenient way to communicate via radio. Many of them can be mounted to a high-cut helmet for easy wear, and some are readily switch between headband, neckband, and helmet mount configurations.</p><p>The downside to these is that like conventional earmuffs, they can get very hot in the summer months, which can lead to user discomfort.</p>"
tactical backpacks,"<h2>Types of tactical backpacks</h2><p>Tactical backpacks are designed for specific uses. The best tactical backpack will be the one that fits your needs. Tactical backpacks can range from small, compact options to large, heavy-duty options. Some are meant for use in urban environments and others are built for outdoor use.</p><h3>Regular tactical backpack</h3><p>This is the best type of bag that can be used for light or day-to-day activities like hiking, mountaineering, vacations, etc. This type may not be military designed, and it is used to house basic things need for such activity.</p><p>They are either small or large tactical backpacks depending on the use or nature of the activity.A regular tactical backpack has dual shoulder straps and is what most tend to go for, with a capacity between 20 and 40 liters. It sits square across the back or front and is the best option for carrying all your gear.</p><h3>Tactical sling</h3><p>The tactical sling bag has a single shoulder strap, angling across the back or front, with a much smaller capacity. This makes it more suited to lightweight use and is an excellent choice for carrying a bladder and handgun and ammo.</p><p>The best sling backpack is simple in design, featuring a single, large storage area for books. Plus, there are a few pockets and compartments for carrying smaller items. The design of the backpack is to be ambidextrous so that it can be carried over the left or right shoulder.</p><h3>MOLLE Backpack</h3><p>Standing for Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment, this particular backpack is used by US and NATO forces. The emphasis is on the modular design that allows for the attachment of various modules for carrying particular types of gear.</p><p>The MOLLE backpack today is considered the premier backpack for the military, hikers, and campers who want it all in one unit. The best advantages start with the modular design, which means that it can be customized for carrying specific equipment.</p>"
rechargeable flashlights,"<h2>Types of rechargeable flashlights</h2><p>There are a lot of options when it comes to rechargeable flashlights. We found the best ones for you, so you can make an educated decision on your next purchase.</p><h3>Handheld rechargeable flashlights</h3><p>Handheld rechargeable flashlights work just like a normal flashlight, but without the hassle and expense of single-use batteries. These flashlights are small enough to carry in one hand or add to your tactical equipment or camping pack.</p><p>Many include a clip for mounting the light to a hat brim or MOLLE loop. These do-it-all solutions should be your first stop when shopping for a rechargeable flashlight.</p><h3>Rechargeable lanterns</h3><p>When you need extra light in a fixed area, reach for a rechargeable lantern. These are fantastic additions to your camping equipment or emergency kits.</p><p>Lanterns put off light in all directions so you can cook, pitch a tent, or relax around the campsite without trying to juggle a handheld flashlight along with everything else you're doing.</p><p>Most aren't as bright as a handheld or tactical flashlight, but they do put off a nice glow that won't burn your eyes.</p><h3>Rechargeable tactical flashlights</h3><p>Tactical flashlights need to do more than be bright, they need to be durable, reliable, and function without occupying your hands. This kind of light typically features variable power output and can be controlled to illuminate a wide area or produce a focused beam.</p><p>The best options incorporate mounting hardware and a remote switch that let you attach them to a rifle and operate the power switch without repositioning your hands.</p><h3>Emergency rechargeable flashlights</h3><p>Rechargeable flashlights intended for emergency use need to be ready at all times. Yes, all rechargeable lights have an advantage over battery-powered alternatives, but even they can go dead if you don't charge them once in a while.</p><p>When the power goes out, you'll have a fully-charged battery to start with. If you've ever had to fill and start a generator by feel, you know how important that is.</p><h3>Rechargeable work lights</h3><p>Rechargeable work lights are designed to be at home in the garage or workshop.nLook for features like hooks and magnets that let you put the light exactly where you need it while keeping your hands free to work.</p>"
tactical pants,"<h2>Types of tactical pants</h2><p>Tactical pants are designed for specific uses, so it's important to know what you need before you buy. Each category has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's best to consider your needs before making a purchase.</p><h3>Duty</h3><p>These are the pants most folks think of when considering tactical pants. If it would look at home in a warzone or on a SWAT team, it is sure to come with lots of features, some more important than others. These are excellent when no subtlety is necessary, such as in the field, or on the range, and storage plus durability are most important.</p><p>Overt tactical pants mimic military uniforms with combat features like deep-set cargo pockets allowed for ample storage and convenient carry. They look very similar to BDU pants.</p><p>If functionality is the priority, overt tactical pants are your speed. Extensive storage space and specialized pockets make this style ideal for outdoor excursions, range days and combat situations where performance is paramount.</p><h3>Covert</h3><p>There are times when advertising your toolset or abilities is less advantageous. These are the times you want your pants to look fairly normal and go unnoticed. This usually means fewer pockets, more average colors, and less storage space.</p><p>Maximizing their usability while remaining subtle about intentions can give you an edge up in today's world.As tactical pants became associated with law enforcement, wearers lost the tactical advantage of not being recognized as someone carrying a weapon.</p><p>Federal agents and undercover officers specifically required the ability to go unnoticed. Tactical brands evolved to meet this need and soon began developing covert designs to complement their overt styles already on the market.</p><h3>Specialized</h3><p>Some tactical pants don't fit neatly into either of the above categories, such as EMS pants with specific pockets for things like trauma shears, or hiking pants, which minimize excess material while maximizing comfort and heat regulation.</p><p>These pants tend to focus on one specific job and do it to perfection. Emergency medical personnel need pants that will hold up to their demanding jobs. EMS Pants utilize specialized compartments for medical tools and other essential gear.</p>"
throwing knives,"<h2>Types of throwing knives</h2><p>Throwing knives come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and blade types. Each has its place in the right situation, but you need to know what you're getting into before you make your final purchase.</p><h3>Blade-Heavy Throwing Knife</h3><p>A blade-heavy throwing knife is one that has more weight in the blade than in the handle. Although it's a little confusing at first, you want the heaviest end of the knife being thrown first, so you would grip the handle of this type of knife when throwing.</p><p>A blade-heavy throwing knife is ideal for beginners because they are more likely to cut through the air with ease and strike a target. It's also safer to learn throwing with this knife because you will hold the handle as you throw, not the blade.</p><h3>Handle-Heavy Throwing Knife</h3><p>A handle-heavy throwing knife features the bulk of its weight in the handle, meaning you would want to throw the knife so that the handle goes first. Since this requires you to hold the blade end of the knife, beginners may have a hard time getting used to it.</p><p>It's significantly harder to throw a handle-heavy knife by the handle. It's always best to throw a blade by gripping its lightest end. With a handle-heavy throwing knife, you will have to hold it using a pinch grip, so it's best to use this type of knife after you develop your throwing skills.</p><h3>Balanced Throwing Knife</h3><p>The two previous types are unbalanced, but on balanced knives, the center of gravity is in the middle. This makes it possible to throw from either the blade or handle without consequence.</p><p>The rotations on balanced throwing knives are more predictable, but some beginners have a hard time at first with these types. Still, these offer much more flexibility. With a balanced throwing knife, it's easier to gauge the knife's landing zone. The rotations the tool makes after throwing are more predictable than a blade- or handle-heavy knife, but it still takes some skill to perform a decent throw.</p>"
skinning knives,"<h2>Types of skinning knives</h2><p>Skinning knives are designed for specific purposes. Some are sharp enough to cut through the hide, while others are blunt enough to scrape off fat without cutting into meat. Lets go over the best types of skinning knives.</p><h3>Drop Point Skinning Knives</h3><p>Drop point blades with good slicing edges make some of the top skinning knives. These types of knives have a large cutting edge, making them the perfect skinners.</p><p>The point is strong and easily controlled, as well. This will make sure you make fine cuts in the skinning process.</p><h3>Clip Point Skinning Knives</h3><p>Choose a small, precise blade for dressing small game such as rabbits or birds or remove the skin for taxidermy purposes.</p><p>Clip-point blades work well for this kind of job. You'll be able to make fine cuts without damaging the hide or the meat.</p><h3>Trailing Point Skinning Knives</h3><p>Trailing point knives are usually lightweight, which gives them great control when it comes to skinning. The large belly and the long cutting edge provide extra handiness.</p><p>The only downside is that the point is usually fragile and cannot penetrate hard materials.</p><h3>Gut Hook Skinning Knives</h3><p>This is a special blade type whereby the spine has a semi-circular sharpene notch cut into it. The gut hook is more of a blade feature than an actual blade shape and is basically a point skinner with a hook added to the back spine.</p><p>The hook comes in very handy in the process of field dressing. It can be placed in a small cut in a carcass's underside and then pulled like a zipper to open up the skin.</p><p>The relatively small hook opens the animal's abdomen without slicing into the muscle, affecting the meat's quality.</p>"
camping stoves,"<h2>Types of camping stoves</h2><p>Camping stoves come in a variety of different styles. Some are designed for cooking over an open flame, while others are meant to be used with liquid fuel like butane or propane canisters. Still other options are designed for cooking with electricity like a portable solar cooker or a stove that plugs into your car's cigarette lighter outlet.</p><p>The best camping stove is the one you feel most comfortable using. If you're new to camping stoves, it might be worth spending a little extra on a stove that's specifically designed for camping use.</p><h3>Backpacking</h3><p>Backpacking stoves are typically lightweight single-burner units that may or may not have the ability to simmer. They are almost exclusively fueled by isobutane/propane canisters or pressurized liquid fuel like white gas. The former is more convenient to use and more efficient, and the latter performs better at altitude and in cold temperatures.</p><p>These stoves are typically designed to boil water fast for rehydrating dehydrated food or cooking simple foods like pasta or couscous. Most are not suitable for large, heavy pots or large groups.</p><h3>Car camping stoves</h3><p>Car camping stoves resemble home kitchen stoves and are much larger, heavier, and more powerful than backpacking stoves. They are portable stove tops and come in one- or two-burner configurations with pop-up windscreens to make them more efficient.</p><p>Car camping stoves are much more versatile and perform better in terms of temperature control when cooking. They're also great for cooking for large groups.</p><h3>Biofuel stoves</h3><p>Biofuel stoves are generally stainless steel containers that serve as small fire pits and gain thermal efficiency through rocket stove design. The upside is that they don't use fossil fuels.</p><p>The downside is that you have to find or bring along the fuel, light a fire, do your thing, wait for it to cool down, and then pack it up if you are moving again. Also, some wilderness areas prohibit fires from time to time.</p>"
walkie talkies,"<h2>Types of walkie talkies</h2><p>Walkie talkie is a generic term for a radio that can be used to communicate with others. There are several different types of walkie talkies, and it's important to know which one you need before making a purchase. Here's an overview of the most common options.</p><h3>Citizen band</h3><p>Citizen band radios are hugely popular with truckers because of their respectable range anywhere from three to 20 miles, depending on the radio and environment and low cost. Both of these advantages come courtesy of CB radio's reliance on AM frequencies.</p><p>These radios are larger than a walkie talkie, so they're best suited to use in a building or vehicle. One of the advantages is the ability to purchase components separately, so you can choose the radio, handset, and antenna that work best for you. If you spend a lot of time on the road, a CB radio can be a solid alternative to a walkie talkie.</p><h3>Family Radio Service</h3><p>When most people talk about walkie talkies, they're referring to radios that operate on frequencies reserved for the family radio service. Easy access to radio communication was in jeopardy at one point, and we owe a debt of gratitude to Radio Shack for stepping in and convincing the federal government to protect certain wavelengths for the general public.</p><p>These FRS radios have limited range and strength of signal because their transmitting power cannot exceed two watts, but they're inexpensive and easy to use. They've become increasingly popular over the years with people who enjoy spending time in the outdoors and families who want to stay in touch on the go.</p><h3>General mobile radio service</h3><p>Like the FRS band general mobile radio service uses FM radio to communicate. This results in signal quality that's much stronger and clearer than what you'd get from a CB radio. The difference between FRS and GMRS lies in power output. Stepping up to a GMRS radio will get you access to a better signal, increased range, and less chatter from other users.</p><p>The downside of GMRS radios is that they're subject to more government regulation. Users need to be licensed to operate on these frequencies. Licensure isnt expensive, but it's an extra step that isn't necessary for most people and it's unnecessarily complicated</p><h3>Amateur radio</h3><p>Amateur radios sound like the easiest option for new users, but the name is a little misleading. This ham designation isn't aimed at new users who want to chat while they hunt, hike, or ski; it's for enthusiasts who want to learn the ins and outs of how radios work.</p><p>Tampering with your radios is frowned upon and may get you in hot water with the authorities - unless you have a ham radio license. In fact, licensed radio operators are encouraged to tinker with their equipment and experiment with getting the most out of it. These radios are far more powerful than anything else on this list, and are capable of achieving tremendous range.</p>"
coolers for camping,"<h2>Types of coolers for camping</h2><p>Coolers are designed to keep food cold. They can be small, portable options or large, stationary options. Coolers come in a variety of styles and sizes, so it's important to know what you're getting into before you make your purchase. We've broken down the different types of coolers below to help you narrow down your search.</p><h3>Traditional coolers</h3><p>Most coolers look exactly like that and have for many years. It is the way. The reason most coolers fall into this category for they work and they don't have to cost a lot.</p><p>These are great for group camping trips, tailgating, and backyard barbeques. They come in all different sizes and hold temperatures low for hours or even days. One of these will ensure that you have safe, cold food for the whole group days into your camping trip.</p><h3>Tubs and tanks</h3><p>If you've been to a big cookout, you've probably seen big, open containers filled with ice. Back in the day, we used corrugated tin water troughs. Now, people use cooler tubs with insulated walls to keep drinks accessible and cold. These coolers have huge amounts of space and make it easy for people to grab and go.</p><p>Tubs and tanks have one serious drawback: they violate the closed-lid rule. Without a lid, they burn through ice much faster and are constantly being bombarded by the hot sun. They make up for this in sheer size. Because they're so big, people can stuff a tremendous amount of ice inside and refill frequently.</p><h3>Power coolers</h3><p>If you can't refill your ice, you're out of luck - almost. Power coolers are effectively refrigerators that can be plugged into vehicles or generators to stay cool indefinitely.</p><p>These are gaining popularity with car campers and overlanders because they allow people to enjoy meat, dairy, and cold drinks for weeks on end. Even when the power source is disconnected, they can hold their temperature for hours like a traditional cooler. This kind of luxury isn't cheap, but it's worth it to replace your beef jerky with freshly grilled steak.</p><h3>Portable coolers</h3><p>There are other options when carrying a full-sized cooler isn't practical. Portable coolers allow you to take a few drinks or a single meal on the go. These can be backpacks that are great for picnics and small outings.</p><p>Because of their small size, portable coolers don't hold temperature as well as larger coolers. Their insulation is much thinner and it's usually necessary to use blocky ice packs rather than loose ice that can fill the cooler evenly.</p>"
long range scopes,"<h2>Types of long-range optics</h2><p>With the best long-range scope, you can see faraway objects and places that are hard to see from a close vantage point. Selecting the proper scope for long-range shooting starts with knowing what the market has to offer.</p><h3>Variable power long-range scope</h3><p>The vast majority of rifle scopes on today's market are variable power optics. A variable power scope allows the shooter to adjust how much magnification their scope can provide, increasing the optic's versatility.</p><p>Some shooters want a scope dedicated entirely to long-range shooting, but the majority of people need something a bit more flexible. These scopes are easy to identify with the ""x to x"" markings. For long-range shooting, look for a variable power optic with a magnification range that spans across the 10x power mark, such as a 5-15x power.</p><h3>Fixed power long-range scope</h3><p>Compared to variable-power optics, fixed-power scopes are inflexible, and as such, are becoming increasingly rare. Still, they provide a lightweight, inexpensive, and mechanically simple option for long-range shooters.</p><p>Most often, these optics come with 10x or 12x magnification and, within certain ranges, can provide a reasonable balance between situational awareness and accuracy potential.</p><p>Probably the biggest draw to fixed-power long-range scopes other than simplicity, weight, and price is nostalgia for bygone eras. If you want to ring steel at 1,000 meters with an old school optic, then a fixed-power scope is the way to go.</p><h3>Extreme long-range scope</h3><p>Typically, long-range shooters engage targets anywhere between 600 and 1,000 meters and call it a day. Since most shooters are lucky to hit steel much beyond 200 meters, these numbers certainly are noteworthy, but there are always those who want to take things to the next level.</p><p>While the definition of extreme long-range shooting varies somewhat from shooter to shooter and from caliber to caliber, marksmen and women who attempt to hit targets beyond the 1,200-meter mark should be equipped with an extreme long-range rifle scope before they pull any triggers.</p><p>Generally speaking, extreme range scopes are heavy, variable power optics with a magnification range starting out at around 7-10x and typically maxing out at 25-35x, although some may have an even higher top end.</p>"
first aid kits,"<h2>Types of first aid kits</h2><p>First aid kits are designed for specific purposes. Some are better suited to treating minor injuries, while others are geared toward more serious cases. There are several options available when it comes to purchasing a first aid kit. Below is a breakdown of the most common types of first aid kits and what they're best used for.</p><h3>Boo-boo kit</h3><p>The bare bones ""boo-boo kit"" wins the dubious distinction of being the most common first aid kit on the market today. These low-cost kits tend to be small and compact, making them convenient for treating minor cuts, scrapes, headaches, and other low-key maladies.</p><p>In the truest sense, these kits barely qualify as first aid kits if at all, but they do fit nicely inside glove boxes, purses, and other tight spaces. Of course, one upside to this diminutive first aid kit is the lack of need for first aid training.</p><p>A typical boo-boo kit will include the following essentials:</p><ul><li>Disposable sterile gloves</li><li>Alcohol wipes</li><li>Antibiotic/antibiotic wipes</li><li>Antiseptic/antiseptic wipes</li><li>Burn cream</li><li>Sting relief wipes</li><li>Adhesive bandages</li><li>Butterfly closures</li><li>Sterile gauze pads</li><li>Adhesive tape</li><li>First aid guide</li></ul><h3>General-purpose first aid kit</h3><p>Everyone should have a good general-purpose first aid kit kicking around the house or the car. While these kits do include the first aid equipment found in the most basic drug store kits, a boo-boo kit this is not. General-purpose first aid kits provide proper care equipment for basic emergencies, such as light to medium bleeding, sprains, broken bones, and diabetic emergencies.</p><p>General-purpose first aid kits commonly appear in well-equipped homes and vehicles. Thankfully, basic first aid training usually is not required with these kits as they often include an adequate first aid guide. That said, don't skip basic first aid training if you can help it.</p><p>A good general-purpose first aid kit will include most or all of the following:</p><ul><li>All boo-boo kit essentials</li><li>Cotton swabs</li><li>Gauze rolls</li><li>Triangular bandage</li><li>Moleskin</li><li>Scissors/shears</li><li>Safety pins</li><li>Splint materials (fingers and/or limbs)</li><li>Thermometer</li><li>Tweezers</li><li>Cold pack</li><li>Emergency blanket</li><li>Glucose/sugar tablets</li><li>Acetaminophen (Tylenol)</li><li>Aspirin</li><li>Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin)</li><li>Plastic bag</li></ul><h3>Advanced first aid kit</h3><p>Emergencies requiring more than patching up common wounds and taming other routine maladies also require the use of an advanced first aid kit. These kits easily handle basic emergencies while also equipping first responders to respond to more traumatic injuries and to provide basic life support, making CPR equipment a crucial component.</p><p>While you may know an EMT or other professional first responder who regularly carries a kit like this, these first aid kits are not the same as an EMT bag. Advanced first aid kits include most or all of the supplies you would expect to find in a general-purpose kit but with a handful of critical extras.</p><p>Other extras often include:</p><ul><li>Antihistamine</li><li>Compressed gauze</li><li>Trauma pads</li><li>Eye pads</li><li>Tourniquet</li><li>Saline/eye wash</li><li>Permanent marker/pen</li></ul>"
survival knives,"<h2>Types of survival knives</h2><p>Survival knives are designed for specific purposes. Some are meant to be used as a hunting knife, some as a pocket knife, and others as a multi-tool. The list below is by no means exhaustive, but it should give you an idea of what's out there.</p><h3>Bushcraft knives</h3><p>Bushcraft knives are purpose-built to enable survivalists to make shelter, fire, and tools using the environment around them. To this end, they will often feature blades with a strong bevel to bite into various types of wood, a full tang to prevent snapping when the blade gets caught or when used to hack through a log, jimping and a finger choil of some sort, comfortable grips, and a thick spine to aid batoning.</p><h3>Fighting knives</h3><p>These knives are made for exactly what it says on the box: fighting. Any of the knives on this list will likely work in a pinch if you have to put a wallop on someone in a fight.</p><p>True fighting knives generally feature blades that are designed for their intended use, such as stabbing. These knives need to be weighted according to their purpose; to aid in hacking with the kukri, and need comfortable grips that aid manipulation in a high-stress, hand-to-hand environment and that mitigate shock vibration from contacting equipment, protective equipment, or bone.</p><h3>Hunting knives</h3><p>Hunting knives encompass a wide variety of blades, ranging from caping knives, dedicated skinning knives, boning knives, filet knives, and so on. Generally speaking, hunting knives will be designed to aid in the cleaning and dressing of game, ranging from varmint species such as rabbits to elk, bear, buffalo, and other large animals.</p><p>These knives should also be made of steel that stands up well to the corrosive effects of blood and that stays sharp for long periods of time, and feature grips that remain tactile even when slick with bodily fluids, which is a consideration for particularly greasy animals like fattened bear or javelina. Some applications such as fishing necessitate additional considerations, such as corrosion resistance.</p><h3>Machetes</h3><p>Machetes are long knives designed specifically for hacking through vegetation, whether for trekking through the jungle or clearing one's backyard. Due to this, they often feature front-heavy blades to aid in swinging, very forgiving blade steel to prevent chipping or breaking, and easily-resharpened edges for prolonged field usage.</p><p>Thee knives are large enough to serve as a machete in some cases when it comes to stripping saplings or chopping through vines.</p><h3>Camp and pack knives</h3><p>Camp and pack knives are the domestic tool of survival knives, not designed to be pulled out in a pinch to free oneself from thick vines or tangled lines, but more for building shelter, cutting food, and other tasks performed during a pause.</p><p>These knives are often larger, heavier, or less durable than knives meant for more general-purpose use due to their more specialized mission. The construction of these knives will vary depending on their intended use, so what constitutes a camp knife is largely up to one's judgement.</p>"
10x42 binoculars,"<h2>Types of 10x42 binoculars</h2><p>Binoculars are made from a variety of different materials, and they need to be treated differently. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to know which you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Roof prism</h3><p>Roof prism binoculars feature internal prisms that closely overlap, keeping them tightly-knit and slimmer in shape. The objective lenses line up directly with the eyepieces for a truly straight-line point of view.</p><p>This makes roof prism 10x42 binoculars slimmer as a result - they're more streamlined and less bulky than other kinds of binoculars. They also tend to be lighter in weight and more compact in size overall.</p><p>Roof prism binoculars are typically more rugged and durable. Their inner workings may be a bit more complex due to their overlapping prisms, but these binoculars are light and easy to hold under even the roughest conditions. However, they're also often more expensive.</p><h3>Porro prism</h3><p>Porro prism binoculars are the original style of binoculars. Created as the first modern binocular, it's the kind that most people still purchase today.</p><p>Inside each pair, prisms are placed in a zig-zag array that's meant to offer better clarity and more three-dimensional images even from great distances. These binoculars tend to be the best choice for wider, larger fields of view; they can do more and offer better images from very far away.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks that come with choosing a pair of Porro prism binoculars. These binoculars are bigger, heavier, and bulkier than their competitors.</p><p>They aren't as easy to hold or as light to carry over long periods of time. However, if you're all about performance and high-quality images, then Porro makes for the perfect choice.</p>"
1911 holsters,"<h2>Types of 1911 holsters</h2><p>There are five basic types of 1911 holsters. Each has its place, but you need to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase.</p><h3>Belt loop</h3><p>Tried and true. Belt loop holsters thread your normal belt, or a tactical accessory, through loops on the holster for waist carry. The only limit is the thickness and strength of the belt itself.</p><p>Issues with this begin to appear if your belt is too small or too loose, and you find your pants being pulled upward with the holster when you attempt a vertical draw.</p><h3>Paddle</h3><p>Instead of a belt loop, paddle holsters use a molded paddle, tightly angled to clip onto the waist of your pants, following the curve of your hip, providing the same physical placement as a belt-loop option with added comfort.</p><p>These typically have a more forgiving draw vs a belt without the upward-riding pull.</p><h3>Shoulder</h3><p>A shoulder holster combines a left or right horizontally laid holster, depending on draw preference, under the armpit, with a counterbalancing ammo and/or accessory pouch to offset the weight.</p><p>Often, these will include hook-and-loop assemblies for attaching each side to the waist of the pants, helping to prevent shift, especially with larger firearms like the 1911.</p><p>They are usually made of leather and connected via an X strap in the upper back to keep the whole thing together and allow for custom adjustment.</p><h3>Belly Band Holster</h3><p>A belly band holster is a wide elastic belt that has a holster built-in to it. This type is also easily concealed under an untucked shirt and can be accessed easily. They are worn very tight though which can cause some discomfort.</p><h3>Thigh Holster</h3><p>A thigh holster is worn where the hand naturally hangs on your leg. This type of holster is used most often when wearing other equipment as well. They don't leave your weapon at easy access.</p>"
in wall gun safes,"<h2>Types of in wall gun safes</h2><p>Gun safes come in all shapes and sizes, so it's important to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but knowing which is right for your home can help you narrow down your search.</p><h3>Long gun in-wall safes</h3><p>Despite the name, these are the plus-sized in-wall safes that offer a wider opening and, in some cases, a little more depth to secure longer firearms like rifles and shotguns.</p><p>There are some premium models that include removable shelving to store extra gear and ammunition or, if you want, you can create a tall handgun safe to store a variety of firearms and other valuables. They usually cost more because of the added material, but not by much.</p><h3>Handgun in-wall safes</h3><p>In-wall handgun safes will be smaller, more compact versions of post office boxes disguised as gun safes. With their taller proportions, even the slimmest safes can carry multiple handguns, and they're easy to carry due to their general size and weight.</p><p>For people simply looking for a place to store important documents and personal items, they're a relatively stress-free item to find a place for. While these are relatively slim, some compact gun safes will eclipse many of the skinnier ones in terms of size.</p><h3>Electronic locking</h3><p>In one fell swoop of my keyboard, these can be summed up as the highest-tech and most secure options, which also carry a few minor headaches to balance it all out. Digital keypads and biometric fingerprint scanners are all the rage with many manufacturers now offering such systems as standard or as an extra-cost upgrade.</p><p>Biometrics are intended to only work with programmed prints. No amount of guesswork in the world can bypass that. Electronic safes will thankfully come with an emergency backup key if such an incident occurs.</p>"
rooftop cargo carriers,"<h2>Types of rooftop cargo carriers</h2><p>There are several different types of rooftop cargo carriers. Each has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Roof bags (Softshell)</h3><p>Roof bags are typically made from heavy-duty waterproof textiles. They can be easily mounted by a single person since they are not too heavy and they can come with a carrying capacity of around 15 cubic feet.</p><p>A softshell carrier is made from a fabric that doesn't maintain its form when empty. This material tends to be treated to weatherproof it, but this isn't a guarantee that your gear will stay dry. Most of these will use zippers and open in a specific way.</p><h3>Rooftop baskets (Open frame)</h3><p>Rooftop baskets are very practical, but at the same time, they are among the most exposed when it comes to cargo safety while traveling at high speeds and you have to take extra measures to make your cargo secure.</p><p>There are many baskets and specific use cargo carriers out there that are an option. Baskets are frames that mount to your roof and will allow you to carry custom load-outs, but they require webbing or straps to secure the gear into the basket.</p><p>These are great options for carrying the specific tool you need, but they don't offer versatility.</p><h3>Rooftop boxes (Hardshell)</h3><p>If you are looking for maximum carrying capacity and security, rooftop boxes are one of the leading options. They are also very popular, so you have multiple designs from many brands to choose from. Most of the rooftop boxes also come with anti-theft protection and a good aerodynamic performance for reduced drag.</p><p>When most people think of roof boxes, a hardshell rooftop cargo carrier is what they picture. They are made from materials or fibers that have been molded or formed into a hard container.</p><p>While most only open from one side, many can open from either side. These styled boxes are slightly more secure than softshell carriers since they can be locked and aren't sliceable.</p>"
binoculars for long distance,"<h2>Types of binoculars</h2><h3>Roof Prism Binoculars</h3><p>Roof prism binoculars are more advanced and a new version of Porro prism binoculars. These binoculars are designed to be perfect in size with style. Lenses and prisms are arranged close and in a straight line, decreasing the size and weight. Also, you can adjust the lens for better focus while viewing.</p><p>Being streamlined, they are more durable than Porro prism. In short, they are very efficient and give a clearer and brighter view than Porro prisms. However, with these advantages, roof prisms are costly compared to other binoculars.</p><h3>Porro Prism Binoculars</h3><p>The older style of binoculars is Porro prism binoculars. Opposite to the roof prisms, Porro prisms do not have lenses and prisms in a straight line. However, they are arranged in a way making an N shape inside the body of the binoculars, which makes them slightly bigger in size than the roof prism binoculars.</p><p>Although old-styled, Porro prism binoculars are still very useful. The mechanism provides better depth perception, allowing the viewer to enjoy a three-dimensional and clear view.</p><p>Moreover, the major difference between a Porro prism and a roof prism is that you have to rotate the eyepiece to control focus in a Porro prism. Although it does not affect the quality of the image, it lets air and dust enter the binoculars. Lastly, Porro prism binoculars are cheaper than roof prism binoculars.</p><h3>Night Vision Binoculars</h3><p>You need a pair of binoculars for night views that will work efficiently in the dark, giving a clear picture. Several models of binoculars are especially well designed for low light views called night vision binoculars.</p><p>Furthermore, night vision binoculars are composed of such components to create a sharp image in the dark by using the little light more efficiently. These binoculars are perfect for nighttime animal hunting and observing something far in low light.</p><p>There are also night vision monoculars besides binoculars. With the benefit of low light performance, these binoculars are expensive.</p>"
solar panels for camping,"<h2>Types of solar panels</h2><p>Solar panels are available in a variety of different sizes and prices. There's no need to break the bank on a high-end panel if you plan to use it for camping or hiking.</p><p>However, there are some options that are worth considering if you're looking for something more durable than the average solar panel. Here are three types of solar panels you can buy with confidence:</p><h4>Flexible panels</h4><p>Also known as CIGS, these thin-film panels are the most expensive, the least efficient, and have the shortest life span of the three types. Their advantage is that they tend to be the lightest to carry around, but also the least durable.</p><h4>Monocrystalline</h4><p>Monocrystalline panels are old-school, traditional solar panels. They're time-tested and proven technology and are among the most efficient (24.4 percent efficient) and dependable panels around. Each module in these panels is made from a single silicon crystal.</p><p>While more efficient, they are also more expensive than polycrystalline and thin-film PV panels. They are usually black in color or iridescent blue. They tend to have greater longevity and more efficiency, but are more fragile.</p><h4>Polycrystalline</h4><p>These panels are made from melted silicon crystals and are less efficient (19.9 percent) than monocrystalline panels. However, they tend to perform better in low-light conditions than monocrystalline panels. They're also less expensive and have a moderate lifespan.</p><p>Because the cells of polycrystalline panels are larger than monos, the panels tend to take up more array space to generate the same amount of power. They're also less durable and don't last as long.</p>"
owb holsters,"<h2>Types of OWB holsters</h2><p>There are a lot of options out there when it comes to owb holsters. It's important to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase.</p><p>Each has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to know which one is right for you. Let's take a look at each type and see how they stack up against one another.</p><h3>Duty holster</h3><p>An OWB duty holster will make it very obvious that you have a gun on your hip. They're large, but they'll hold larger, modified, or full-size handguns, and some will even be designed to wear with other duty gear like plate carriers or battle belts.</p><p>Of course, because it's so obvious, you'll want it to have active and passive retention systems as well as a highly durable construction.</p><h3>Concealed carry holster</h3><p>An OWB concealed carryholster typically uses lighter and thinner materials so you have an easier time fitting the rig under a shirt or jacket. The holster will fit close to your body and shouldn't cause much printing or unsightly bulges.</p><p>If you do choose to use OWB for concealed carry, you might not want or need active retention.</p><h3>Competition holster</h3><p>While you might think an OWB competition holsterwould be the same as a range holster, you'd be wrong. Competition holsters must meet certain safety and performance standards set by the organization managing the event.</p><p>Typically, you won't need duty-level retention, but you will need dependable passive retention. Additionally, you'll want adjustable features for quick access and draw.</p><h3>Range holster</h3><p>For an OWB range holster, you won't need much. Just something that supports your firearm. While it's always ideal to have a holster designed with a mold of your firearm, a universal - as in fits any similar-style handgun - could work because you're in a controlled environment. Of course, you'll want it to safely cover the trigger. That's a must.</p>"
hunting knives,"<h2>Types of hunting knives</h2><p>Hunting knives come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Each has its place, but you need to know what you're getting into before you buy. Here's a breakdown of the most common types of hunting knives so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Folding</h3><p>The biggest advantage folding knives possess is their compact size. With its slim handle and movable pocket clip, it's a wonderful, high-end every day carry or backup to your primary hunting knife.</p><p>No matter what kind of mechanism a folding knife uses, it's never as strong as a solid piece of metal. Folders aren't well-suited to more rigorous tasks like breaking down large game animals.</p><p>All the small moving parts that allow a folding knife to open and close get filled with gunk, too. Using one as a hunting knife will result in sticky blood and all kinds of other nastiness gumming up the works.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>Hunting knives have typically used a fixed blade, and that's still true in most cases. Many of the tasks hunting knives are expected to do require a fair amount of force, so being rigid allows them to hold up to the abuse. The lack of any moving parts makes them much stronger than folders.</p><p>In terms of size, fixed-blade knives are generally larger than folding knives. That's fine in this case because hunters don't need to restrict themselves to knives that fit in a pocket. Large blades are useful when setting up a blind, breaking down big game, and doing chores around the campsite.</p><p>We also can't overlook the maintenance our gear requires. Keeping a fixed-blade knife in peak shape is as simple as sharpening, oiling the steel, and maybe rubbing some wax into the handle.</p>"
weighted vests,"<h2>Types of weighted vests</h2><p>Weighted vests are designed to hold a specific amount of weight. There are many different types of weighted vests on the market, each with its own set of features and benefits. Here is a quick overview of some of the most popular types of weighted vests:</p><h3>Backpack vests</h3><p>Backpack vests are weighted vests that leave the front of the torso open and all of the weight in the shoulders straps and back. These types of vests offer a greater range of motion for the wearer, but they typically don't range as high in weight capacity.</p><p>Backpack vests seem to be more favorable to users who intend to wear the vest while performing cardio exercises, such as running, walking, rucking, and dance-offs. Backpack vests seem to be the style most recommended for women since the open front eliminates the uncomfortable restraints of a full-front weighted vest.</p><h3>Plate carrier</h3><p>Anyone who's deployed overseas in the last 20 years has probably worn a plate carrier, IOTV (Improved Outer Tactical Vest). When worn for long periods of time.</p><p>Plate carrier vests are modeled after (and sometimes serve double duty as) military or law enforcement grade body armor. These vests are usually lifted over the head and then synched around the abdomen with Velcro straps or buckles.</p><p>On the front and back of the vests are two large pockets, meant to hold cast iron or laser-cut weight plates, but can also hold some sizes of standard circular plates in a pinch. Plate carrier vests are usually made with durable Cordura fabric and are meant to take a beating.</p><h3>Pouch vests</h3><p>Pouch vests, as their made-up name implies, are weighted vests that carry weight in a series of well-placed pouches around the torso. The pouches can be filled with a variety of different weight options, such as small iron bars or bags filled with steel shot, iron shavings, or sand.</p><p>The size and quantity of the pouches on these vests allows the wearer to make more nuanced adjustments to their workout weight but forces them to pay more attention to how the weight is distributed over the body. These vests tend to be more budget-friendly than plate carriers.</p>"
bore sight,"<h2>Types of bore sights</h2><p>Bore sights use either a laser or physical reticle to show roughly where a round would impact. They are designed to fit inside the muzzle of your weapon or be chambered like a real round.</p><p>Each classification has its advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to know which you need before making a purchase. Here are some tips for spotting bore sights.</p><h3>Chambered lasers</h3><p>Caliber-specific bore sights are shaped like an actual round and are chambered to direct the laser all the way through the barrel and out to your target. Power comes from a stack of small batteries that are commonly used in small devices like hearing aids.</p><p>This style is very affordable and compact, and many shooters swear by it. The downside of this style is that a given bore sight cannot be used for firearms of different calibers.</p><p>If you only have one firearm or a small collection, the cost savings are worth it. Collectors will want to spend more to get a universal bore sight.</p><h3>Muzzle-mounted lasers</h3><p>Many laser bore sights attach directly to the business end of your weapon for easy installation. A short probe will be inserted into the barrel, and a removable adapter will be used to secure it in place.</p><p>Each kit comes with enough adapters to work with common barrel diameters. At the muzzle, the flared body creates a snug fit. The result is an alignment that projects straight out from your weapon's barrel.</p><p>The main advantage of this style is compatibility with nearly all firearm calibers. If you want to make one purchase and be done with it, this is the way to go.</p><h3>Muzzle-mounted optical systems</h3><p>Optical bore sights ditch the laser and batteries altogether. This style still mounts to the muzzle but uses a glass lens with a reticle to indicate where your optic should be placed. As with high-end laser bore sights, optical bore sight kits include adapters for a vast array of calibers and barrel diameters.</p><p>With this style, you'll get a lens with a crosshair reticle that will align with the reticle on your optic or your sights when a zero is achieved. Kits include rods designed to fit snugly in specific bore sizes for an accurate reading.</p><p>These kits cost more than laser alternatives upfront but they're basically universal, never need batteries, and should last longer than you do if you take care of them.</p>"
spotting scopes,"<h2>Types of spotting scopes</h2><p>Spotting scopes are a great way to get into the world of optics, but there's a lot to choose from. Before you spend your hard-earned money on a spotting scope, make sure you know what you're getting into. Here are some tips for spotting scope shopping.</p><h3>Straight spotting scopes</h3><p>Straight spotting scopes look similar to a large rifle scope or a small telescope. Many hunters prefer them because their slim shape is easy to pack.</p><p>This style also allows fast target acquisition because you can line them up before going to the glass. You can also keep a lower profile, which is good in hunting and tactical situations.</p><p>On the downside, they're awkward to use on an incline but more comfortable facing downhill. If you're part of a group that will be sharing the optic, people of different heights will have a harder time getting to eye level with a straight spotting scope.</p><h3>Angled spotting scopes</h3><p>Angled spotting scopes are generally shorter end-to-end, but they take up more space than a straight scope. Many people find that bending over an angled eyepiece is easier than getting behind a straight one.</p><p>A lot of guides attach cameras or digital displays to their spotting scopes, and this type of setup works much better with an angled eyepiece. The tradeoff to being easier to use on an incline is that angled spotting scopes require serious neck contortions to use on a decline.</p><p>They can also be cumbersome to use when mounted to a vehicle's window. You'll also have to be more mindful of snow and rain accumulating on the eyepiece.</p><h3>Spotting scopes with a reticle</h3><p>The vast majority of spotting scopes use an unmarked reticle. They provide an unobstructed view of the target. Some, on the other hand, include a reticle similar to what you'd see on a rifle scope.</p><p>There are various styles, including MIL and MOA markings. A reticle can be used to estimate range and is especially useful when talking a shooter onto a target.</p><p>Having a reticle on your spotting scope seems like a significant advantage, but most people choose not to use one. Finding this kind of scope takes a little bit of digging, and using one effectively requires practice.</p>"
bowie knives,"<h2>Types of bowie knives</h2><p>Bowie knives come in all kinds of shapes and sizes, so it's important to know what you're getting into before you buy. We classify according to blade design as its a critical factor when choosing a Bowie Knife. For instance, for situations where a significant amount of control over the tip is required. Here are a few tips for narrowing down your options:</p><h3>Clip Point blade</h3><p>This type of blade design is often the best choice. In fact, the iconic Bowie Knife features a classic Clip Point blade design which is characterized by a straight spine that extends forward from the bolster or handle.</p><p>Then incorporates either a straight or concave drop to the tip of the blade such that it appears as if that section of the blade has been clipped off.</p><p>The purpose of this design is to both lighten the tip of the blade for better balance and to position the tip of the blade below the spine, close to the center line, for greater control and increased piercing ability.</p><h3>Drop Point blade</h3><p>This type of blade design is characterized by a straight spine that extends forward from the bolster or handle and then incorporates a continuous, convex, curve from the spine of the blade to the tip.</p><p>Such that it positions the tip of the blade below the spine and near the center line of the blade for greater control when performing precision cutting tasks.</p><p>The drop-point performs well in combat scenarios, under pressure in survival situations, it's an excellent camping buddy, and it's one of the easiest knife shapes to maintain.</p><h3>Straight Back</h3><p>This type of blade design is characterized by a straight spine that extends level from the bolster or handle to the tip and provides the least amount of control over the tip. But also causes the belly of the blade to have an extended cutting edge which is useful for slicing.</p><p>These blades are extremely minimal and usually quite thin with the idea of being simple and light. These are excellent knives to use when cutting away from you as the curvature of the blade allows for a very smooth movement forward.</p>"
bug out backpack,"<h2>Types of bug-out backpacks</h2><p>There are several types of bug-out backpacks, but they all have one thing in common: they need to be able to fit a lot of supplies. The good news is that there are options for every budget and need. We've rounded up the best options for each category below.</p><h3>Get home bag</h3><p>While technically different than a 72-hour bug out bag, the get home bag serves a similar purpose and must meet similar requirements with the exception of size.</p><p>A get home bag flips the bug out bag concept on its head and instead contains the gear and provisions necessary to reach home from a number of predetermined locations, such as the office.</p><p>Since most people spend the majority of their time less than three days from home, get home bags tend to be much smaller and contain fewer supplies than their big brothers.</p><h3>Bug out bag</h3><p>A true bug out bag stores away all the necessities you could ever need to survive for up to 72 hours in unfamiliar settings during unsettling events.</p><p>They have plenty of space for water, essential foodstuffs, medical gear, fire starters, sheltering equipment, and other user-specific items, such as a rain poncho, a compass, a multitool or survival knife, and a solar phone charger.</p><p>They are tough and can withstand use in urban, suburban, or rural settings, depending on where you live.</p><h3>Tactical backpack</h3><p>These are the go-to option for most people looking to bug-out because of their ability to carry so much weight. They're made with thick material to prevent punctures or rips.</p><p>Some even include straps to make them easier to carry. These are great options if you plan on carrying a rifle or other heavy gear.</p>"
camelbak,"<h2>Types of camelbaks</h2><p>These are several types of camelbaks out in the market. The common feature among nearly all of them is the included hydration reservoir that makes drinking easy. A handful of packs usually ones designed for running include water bottles rather than a reservoir.</p><h3>Hiking hydration packs</h3><p>These packs are a lot like standard packs for hiking and usually feature ample cargo space for food, extra layers and the essentials that you should carry on every outing. They range in size from small packs for short hikes to ones that are big enough for ultralight overnight backpacking.</p><h3>Cycling hydration packs</h3><p>These packs are designed specifically for road cycling and mountain biking. Those designed for the road are typically compact and low-profile so they feel light and stable on your back and won' t create a ton of wind resistance.</p><p>Packs designed for mountain biking are often a bit larger to accommodate extra gear, cycling clothing bike tools. All cycling hydration packs typically have low-profile waistbelts that won't interfere with your pedaling.</p><h3>Running vests</h3><p>As you might expect, these look like a vest and are designed to fit snug to your body. They are similar to a backpack in that they are carried over the shoulders and on your back, but they tend to be a bit lower profile, feature more pockets on the front of the shoulder straps, and don't have a hipbelt like most packs do.</p><p>Many include dedicated spots for storing water bottles on the front of the shoulder straps. Most vests also accommodate a hydration reservoir for runners who like to sip from a tube.</p><h3>Running backpacks</h3><p>These are a lot like a backpack that you'd take on a day hike but with running-specific features, such as a low-profile design, a simple hipbelt and a bunch of pockets that are easy to access while you're running.</p><p>They sometimes provide more storage than vests, mostly in the back of the pack, making them a good choice for long trail runs that require lots of extra food and clothing.</p><p>Nearly every running pack accommodates a hydration reservoir for easy sipping on the go reservoirs are sometimes sold separately. Many also include pockets on the shoulder straps or sides if you prefer to use water bottles.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>The Army may not endorse CamelBak systems, their stamp of OK does show that the big brass may have finally figured out what we already knew. While anyone can slap MOLLE onto a bag and call it a day CamelBak makes sure that their bags provide the features and quality America's grunts have come to expect from quality field gear.</p>"
bivy sack,"<h2>Types of bivy sacks</h2><p>There are a lot of options out there when it comes to picking out the right kind of bivy sack. There are three main types of bivy sacks that you'll come across on your search for one that's perfect for you. Here's a quick lowdown on each type.</p><h3>Four-Season Bivy Sacks</h3><p>Four-season bivies can be used year-round and are more similar to tents than just a standard sack. This kind of bivy often comes with poles or stakes to create more room around your head, and is made of tough and durable materials.</p><p>Four-season bivies tend to be the most weatherproof by design and can be used in a wide range of conditions. The one downside to four-season bivy sacks is that they tend to be much heavier than minimalist options.</p><h3>Bug Net Bivy Sacks</h3><p>This type of sack also tends to be lightweight and is good for using during fair, dry weather. These bivies will keep the bugs out with the built-in net, but don't protect much when it comes to weather.</p><h3>Ultralight Bivy Sacks</h3><p>On the other end of the spectrum, you've got your ultralight bivies which are designed with minimalism in mind. These bivies don't have any poles but are instead ultralight and packable. They're great to have with you in case you need an emergency shelter.</p><h3>Bivy shelter</h3><p>Bivy shelters exist as a sort of hybrid between a bivy sack and a one-man tent. Like bivy sacks, these shelters are lightweight, easy to set up, and an amazing way to sleep out under the stars.</p><p>They use a one or two-pole setup to keep the shelter away from the sleepers face, but most of the shelter is constructed just like a bivy shelter with the possible exception of one or two stake loops.</p><p>Most bivy shelters also include integrated bug netting for a peaceful night's sleep. These shelters are heavier than bivy sacks yet are still trail friendly.</p>"
headlamps,"<h2>Types of headlamps</h2><p>Headlamps are designed for specific tasks. Some headlamps are meant to replace a flashlight, while others are intended for use in the dark. There are plenty of options out there for all kinds of uses and budgets.</p><h3>Action sports</h3><p>Extreme sports require extreme gear. You wouldn't trail on your mountain bike with one hand holding a flashlight, and you shouldn't strap a substandard headlamp to your helmet either.</p><p>Extreme sports demand the best gear. Headlamps designed for this world come with various color and power settings, rechargeable batteries, and heavy-duty construction.</p><p>They can burn brighter and longer in harsher environments than other headlamps. As a result, you can expect to pay top-dollar for one of these. That shouldn't dissuade you, though, because these are tools rather than gadgets.</p><h3>Everyday</h3><p>Basic headlamps are designed to get the job done without spending a lot of money. They're affordable, reasonably capable, and use common batteries that you can find at any gas station or convenience store in a pinch.</p><p>This is a great way to replace whichever tired, old flashlight you're using now. Everyday headlamps are nice to have when you need to do chores after dark or DIY projects around the house.</p><p>They can also save you from ussing out an unsuspecting child for not shining the flashlight at the right place when you're fixing your car. This kind of headlamp isn't the most advanced, but it's an upgrade over holding a normal flashlight.</p><h3>Camping</h3><p>A good headlamp is one of the best pieces of gear you can add to your camping pack. For starters, it's a lot safer to move around in the dark if your hands are free to move branches and catch yourself if you fall.</p><p>Once you start putting your tent together and cooking dinner, a headlamp will make a world of difference. Camping headlamps typically have multiple output settings so you can choose the right amount of light for the task at hand.</p><p>Low settings are good for referencing a map or finding something in your pack, and high settings are great for moving safely after the sun goes down. They're usually lightweight and compact, which is important when you're moving on foot. You can also expect some degree of protection against water and impacts.</p>"
carry on backpacks,"<h2>Types of carry-on backpacks</h2><p>There are many types of carry-on backpacks, each with its own set of features and benefits. The most important factor to consider when choosing a backpack is what type of traveler you are.</p><p>Are you a light packer who only needs a few essentials, or are you a heavy packer who needs to bring everything but the kitchen sink? Other factors to consider include the size and weight of the backpack, as well as the type of material it is made from.</p><h3>Camping backpack</h3><p>With more and more millennials and post-millennials traveling to new hiking and camping spots halfway across the country, backpack manufacturers are creating packs that are just at home on a plane as on the trail.</p><p>Many of these backpacks include the frames one might expect from an outdoor pack, but they also include laptop sleeves and other air-friendly features that make them an incredibly versatile option.</p><h3>Urban backpack</h3><p>One of the two most common styles available, the urban backpack is a regular site on college campuses, at the office, and in airport terminals. Originally designed with students in mind, this style includes a main compartment with a laptop sleeve, a couple smaller compartments, and a side pocket or two. If books, style, or a low profile are your thing, this may be your best option.</p><h3>Tactical backpack</h3><p>Think of a tactical backpack as a small, ""civilianized"" rucksack. Usually, these packs include a couple of main compartments with plenty of smaller external pouches and pockets and a slot for either a laptop or a hydration bladder sometimes both.</p><p>Some models may include a slot compartment for ground-based CCW use, and well-engineered designs will have zippers that run down to the base for easy packing and access to all your gear.</p>"
camping pillows,"<h2>Types of camping pillows</h2><p>There are many different types of camping pillows on the market. Camping pillows come in a variety of sizes and materials. Some are inflatable, some are filled with down, and some are even made of memory foam.</p><p>Choosing the right camping pillow for you will depend on a few factors, including how much support you need, how much weight you want to carry, and how much space you have in your pack.</p><h3>Inflatable</h3><p>Inflatable pillows are popular for backpackers who want comfort on the trail while accounting for every cubic inch and ounce of gear in their packs.</p><p>At the core, an inflatable pillow is an air chamber inflated by breath and secured by a valve. Air chamber materials vary from a thick and durable polyurethane commonly used by Therm-a-Rest, to other materials that are thinner and lower weight. Some may include baffles that help the pillow retain shape or create a pocket for your head.</p><p>But the real differences in inflatable pillows are seen and felt in the covers. These may be removable or adhered to the exterior of the air chamber. Options include brushed polyester, jersey, nylon, and more. Some inflatable pillow covers incorporate down or synthetic fill padding for extra comfort. Many inflatable pillows are designed with a contoured shape that works well in a sleeping bag hood.</p><h3>Compressible</h3><p>A compressible pillow is ideal for car campers who don't want to compromise comfort in the outdoors. Affectionately referred to as car camping pillows, these are the most comfortable category of camping pillows, but they come at the cost of also being the largest and heaviest.</p><p>They get their high loft and superb cushion from a solid fill of memory foam, synthetic fill, or a combination of the two. And, because of their solid fill, expect these pillows to only compress down to roughly half their size. If looking for a pillow in this category, think about an ultra durable version of your most comfortable pillow at home.</p><h3>Hybrid</h3><p>Hybrid pillows include an inflatable air chamber, while also incorporating a mix of foam and/or synthetic fill into the main chamber. In return, you get a pillow that has more cushion and support than a typical inflatable pillow, and is much lighter and packable than a solid-fill compressible pillow.</p><p>Hybrid pillows incorporate features and materials seen in both compressible and inflatable pillows, creating a category of pillow that can function for both car campers and backpackers.</p>"
hiking pants for women,"<h2>Types of hiking pants for women</h2><p>There are hiking pants for every budget, and it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase. There are many different types of hiking pants for women, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.</p><h3>Regular hiking pants</h3><p>They aren't to be confused with regular pants like jeans made from materials that may not wick sweat and moisture from the skin. Hiking pants, a relatively recent innovation in the outdoor world, are specifically designed to be lightweight, breathable, and water-resistant.</p><p>This style of pants may be the most basic, but it's also the most used, and that's for good reason. The fact that the style is so simple makes it appealing to a lot of people, and its basic design also makes it very comfortable to wear and use during a hike. In essence, traditional hiking pants embody the idea of less is more.</p><p>Basically, it's recommended that you wear them in casual hiking situations. The great thing about this style of pants is that it's very versatile, and it can be used in a lot of situations. But on the negative side, it doesn't really excel in any one area, and it simply can't function as well as the other styles of pants in certain major areas.</p><h3>Convertible Hiking Pants</h3><p>Convertible hiking pants are the ones where there is a zipper that separates the bottom and upper parts of the pants so that you can take off the bottom part when you need to. Now you should see how this style can be very appealing to a number of people especially when you compare it to the previous style.</p><p>This style is also very versatile, but in a different way than the regular hiking pants. Convertible hiking pants are versatile in the sense that their design can inherently adapt to different situations to operate in the best way.</p><p>They work best for when the climate or environment is going to change during your hike, which again would most likely happen if you plan on hiking for a while. The overall comfortability may be dampened until you convert them into shorts due to the nature of the zippered design. Keep in mind that you need to store the pant legs when you take them off.</p><h3>Softshell hiking pants</h3><p>Softshell hiking pants provide the same benefits as a good pair of regular hiking pants in terms of protecting you from the elements, but they expand your range of comfort during chilly outdoor activities thanks to their marginally heavier weight and available brushed cloth lining for added warmth.</p><p>Softshell hiking pants also tend to be slightly less form-fitting than regular hiking pants, making them ideal for wearing a base layer underneath. Like regular hiking pants, soft shell hiking pants are not waterproof but can be worn under hard shell rain pants for added protection from rain and snow.</p>"
combat boots,"<h2>Types of combat boots</h2><p>The best combat boots are those that are both comfortable and stylish. They should be able to protect your feet from the elements and keep them warm in the winter. They should also be able to withstand the rigors of combat and provide you with the support you need.</p><p>Are you looking for the best combat boots? You've come to the right place! We'll help you find the perfect pair of combat boots to suit your needs.</p><h3>Jungle boots</h3><p>Basic combat boots are sometimes referred to as either jungle boots or moon boots, depending on what type of climate they're built for. It's a good idea to own one of each in good condition at all times.</p><p>Jungle boots are thinner, lighter, and uninsulated. They feature large synthetic panels to create airflow and allow your feet to stay cool in warm environments. Open metal eyelets in the arch areas allow water to drain out, should you need to cross a body of water.</p><p>Moon boots are designed for cold weather. Instead of textiles, they use leather and insulation to keep your body heat inside. Thicker soles raise your feet off the ground to protect you from the cold.</p><h3>Running boots</h3><p>Once the U.S. military started emphasizing functional fitness, exercising in combat boots became standard practice across branches. Unfortunately, most combat boots are lousy to run in.</p><p>Running boots are designed for speed. They weigh very little compared to traditional combat boots and feature soles designed for running rather than rucking. If you want to improve your CFT or O-course time, these are sure to help.</p><p>Because they place a premium on lightness, running combat boots don't hold up well under heavy loads. Wearing them on a field exercise with heavy gear can easily pack out the soles and leave your feet aching. I recommend saving these for PT and timed events.</p><h3>Steel-toe boots</h3><p>Most of you probably don't need steel-toe boots, but some of you need them to do your job. Having adequate protection for your feet is critical to staying mission-ready and preserving your long-term health.</p><p>Uniform regs dictate that you can't just roll into work with a pair of Chippewasnon your feet (no matter how awesome they are), so you need to find a protective pair of combat boots like the ones on this list.</p><p>Much like running boots, these are job-specific and shouldn't be worn for other activities like field exercises or PT. Keep them in the shop, where they belong.</p>"
gaiter mask,"<h2>Types of gaiter masks</h2><p>There are three basic types of gaiter masks. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, so you'll need to pick the right one for your needs. We'll break down each type below.</p><h3>Fishing</h3><p>Fishing gaiter masks are another popular type of gaiter mask. This type of mask is similar to a running mask, but the material usually features the highest UPF rating, to block out most of the sun's harmful rays while fishing throughout the day.</p><p>Fishing gaiter masks come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and design patterns. They are typically waterproof, designed to keep you dry in the case of any splashes while fishing rivers, lakes, tributaries, and streams.</p><h3>Running</h3><p>Running gaiter masks are typically the most lightweight and made from extremely breathable material. Even though they are the lightest option, make sure that the material will be protective enough.</p><p>A quality running mask will typically be UV-resistant, made from a material with a UPF rating to protect you from the sun's harmful rays while outdoors. This type of gaiter mask is often made from a moisture-wicking technology, designed to keep you cool while running, hiking, climbing, backpacking, and more.</p><h3>Skiing</h3><p>Skiing gaiter masks are specifically designed for use in the coldest climates and hazardous weather conditions. This type of mask is typically the most expensive because it is built from the heaviest material, such as wool or thick cotton fabric.</p><p>In addition to skiing, this type of gaiter mask makes a great option for snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, biking, ATV riding, and UTV riding. If you are participating in outdoor activities in warmer weather conditions, you may want to consider one of the other types of gaiter masks.</p>"
hiking watch,"<h2>Types of hiking watches</h2><p>There are hiking watches for every budget and hiking season. Before you pull the trigger on a new watch, make sure you know what you're getting into. Here's a breakdown of the most common options to help you make an educated decision.</p><h3>Military-inspired watches</h3><p>Useful when you plan to hike in challenging conditions, these watches are built to withstand extreme cold and heat. Water-resistant and submergible to depths up to 100 meters, these watches are excellent when roughing it outdoors.</p><p>Among their many features, these digital watches often incorporate a compass, GPS, and altimeter technology. Many also include thermometers and can forecast the weather. Though these come at a higher price point, they last the longest and usually perform the best.</p><h3>GPS watches</h3><p>This is a common type of hiking watch and is very useful to those traveling in unfamiliar areas. As with most modern watches, these are usually digital and use quartz technology to run the clock. The LCD display should work in both 12- and 24-hour settings and usually the watch will be waterproof.</p><p>These models set themselves apart because of the built-in navigation systems. Usually, the GPS system will connect to software like Galileo and Globnass. Check that the GPS features don't drain the battery when making your pick. Also, keep in mind that many do feature altimeters and other monitoring tech, but not all GPS watches have these components.</p><h3>Fitness watches</h3><p>If you are using hiking as a way to exercise, then fitness watches can make a good addition to your hike. Unlike other types that can be a bit bulky and somewhat heavier, you can leave these watches on all the time. Digital and high-tech, this type of watch is made to monitor your vitals while you hike.</p><p>Connecting to GPS in order to track your steps, these watches help you find your way. During your hike, they read your heart rate, and some monitor oxygen saturation and blood pressure. To see how hiking is working for you in all aspects of life, the sleep monitoring software adds value. It's especially handy if you hunt and camp during the same trips and want to streamline your camping accessories.</p>"
gentlemans knife,"<h2>Types of gentleman knives</h2><p>There are several types of gentleman knives to choose from. Each has its place, but you need to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase.</p><h3>Single-Blade Pocket Knives</h3><p>Single-blade pocket knives come in many shapes and sizes, but their best qualities are their simplicity and size. Unlike multi-blade pocket knives, single-blade folders focus solely on the design of one larger blade.</p><p>These knives usually have locking mechanisms that make them stronger and sturdier for more demanding work. They can also have spring-loaded opening mechanisms, allowing them to pop open at a second's notice.</p><p>Of course, the disadvantage of a single blade is its lack of variety. These knives are perfect if you're looking for a strong all-purpose knife, but if you're in need of a knife that can saw through wood in one moment and whittle in the next, you're out of luck.</p><h3>Multi-Blade Pocket Knives</h3><p>Having multiple blades enables you to carry one pocket knife that can do the job of two or three. Multi-blade pocket knives generally have two, three or four blades. Two-blade models tend to be very traditional and feature a combination of spey, sheepsfoot, pen or drop point blades.</p><p>However, three or four-blade models give you the option of having several blade types at your dispense. Even though multi-blade models give you a variety, you won't get as much strength or durability as a pocket knife with one blade. It's a trade-off you'll have to consider when deciding which type of knife to buy.</p><h3>Multi-tools</h3><p>Sometimes you need a pocket knife with more than just blades. Saws, toothpicks, tweezers, can openers, nail files, scissors, corkscrews and magnifying glasses are all common features of Swiss Army knives and other multi-tools, which are the most multi-dimensional pocket knives on the market.</p><p>The Swiss Army knife was originally created to meet the demand of soldiers in the field who would need to perform a number of tasks a single blade couldn't always handleMulti-tools are best suited for the jack-of-all-trades who finds himself needing a whole range of tools within arm's reach at all times.</p>"
3 season tent,"<h2>Types of 3-season tents</h2><p>There are many options to choose from when it comes to buying a new tent. The key is knowing which type you need before making a purchase.</p><h3>Tunnel</h3><p>A tunnel tent is by far the largest and most spacious of all the types of three-season tents. Tunnel tents are typically available in larger sizes, offer tons of sleeping space, and can easily accommodate large families or large groups of up to 10 people.</p><p>This type of tent features multiple flexible poles that stretch from one end of the tent to the other, forming a tunnel shape. As long as there is enough room for this large tent at your campsite, tunnel tents can be the perfect option for group camping.</p><p>The only downside of this type of tent is that they are not very portable if you are hiking or need to travel a long distance to your campsite.</p><h3>Dome</h3><p>Dome-style tents are one of the most popular and most common types of three-season tents. They are most recognized by their curved pole structure, creating the look of a camping dome.</p><p>Two long poles stretch vertically over the tent, intersecting at the top, and locking into the ground. A dome tent offers plenty of interior space and headroom for taller individuals.</p><p>Three-season dome tents typically feature a heavy duty rain fly, built to withstand inclement weather like rain, sleet, and light snow. Some of the larger dome tents even include a screened porch section.</p><h3>Pop-Up</h3><p>Pop-up tents are by far the most user-friendly and easiest type of three-season tent to set up. These tents are easy to travel with, and simply pop up, ready for use. These tents are most common in small sizes, including one-person or two-person backpacking tents.</p><p>However, pop-up tents can occasionally be available in larger sizes. In addition to camping, larger-sized pop-up tents make a great backyard tent for families and are commonly used at festivals or outdoor events. They are relatively inexpensive, but if you are a frequent camper, you may want to consider a more durable type of tent.</p>"
reloading kit,"<h2>Types of reloading kits</h2><p>There are several types of reloading kits available. Each has its place, but you need to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase. Here's a breakdown of the most common options.</p><h3>Single-stage Press</h3><p>The single-stage press is the best reloading kit for beginners, thanks to its ease of use and lower cost. These kits have little room for error. They require the least maintenance.</p><p>Some say they are the most reliable press since they have the least amount of interchangeable components. This is why many use them for rifle cartridges. The basic design dramatically decreases the amount of maintenance that other presses require. Less maintenance required means more longevity.</p><p>There are some downfalls to the very basic designs of these presses. Single-stage kits only conduct a single function on one die each time the lever is pulled. This causes reloading with this press to be the most time-consuming.</p><h3>Turret Press</h3><p>A turret press and a single-stage press are similar because they both perform one function on a single die for every pull of the lever. They both have one shell holder. The main difference is the turret ring found at the top of the turret press.</p><p>This piece contains multiple dies and allows for quick change between dies and bushings. Therefore, the turret press's reloading process is more efficient than that of a single-stage press, where one would have to switch out the reloading dies manually.</p><p>A turret reloading press might be suited best for someone who appreciates the simplicity of the single-stage, but desires a faster reloading process; all without breaking the bank.</p><h3>Progressive Reloading Press</h3><p>Unlike both the single-stage and turret press, the progressive press can produce an entire round of ammunition with a single pull of the lever. Its process, somewhat similar to the turret press, contains inserts for multiple dies within its structure.</p><p>However, instead of using one die at a time, the progressive reloading press can use multiple dies with the addition of a shell plate and several shell holders. If you plan to purchase a press for your handgun, or want to reload ammo in high volume, you might consider selecting a progressive reloading press.</p><p>Although progressive presses allow for greater efficiency, there are a couple drawbacks to these intricately designed kits. Because it can perform so many tasks within the same action, it requires more frequent maintenance and adjustments, making it more suitable for someone with prior experience. This is something to keep in mind if you are just now learning about the reloading process. Also, progressive presses are typically the most expensive.</p>"
bushcraft axes,"<h2>Types of bushcraft axes</h2><p>Bushcraft axes come in many different shapes and sizes.

It's even possible to take down medium-sized trees.</p><h3>Bushcraft felling axe</h3><p>A bushcraft felling axe is the right choice if you want an axe that can handle some seriously big tasks. These axes are significantly longer and heavier, and they're designed to take down big or even massive trees. Made just for felling, these axes tend to have handles between 24 and 30 inches long with a head that weighs between 2 and 4 pounds in total.</p><p>A felling axe isn't the most travel-ready option, but it's the best choice if you need to take down trees. These are great for anyone who's working on their own outdoor property or headed into thickly wooded areas.</p>"
led flashlight,"<h2>Types of LED flashlights</h2><p>There are three main types of LED flashlights. Each has its own unique set of features, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>EDC LED flashlights, or everyday carry LED flashlights, are the most budget-friendly and portable type of LED flashlight.

fire starter,"<h2>Types of fire starters</h2><p>Fire starters come in a variety of different types, and it's important to know which one you need for your situation. Here are some examples:</p><h3>Friction</h3><p>The most basic way to start a fir is with a good old-fashioned bow drill. You can theoretically do the same thing freehand, but it takes way more effort and the likelihood of success is low. Ferro rods make the process easier by replacing wood with steel and combustible ferrocerium.</p><p>This is probably the most rewarding way to start a fire because it takes the most skill. The principles can also be put to use with a homemade bow drill or flint and steel in an emergency, so you can take comfort in building a lifelong skill.</p><h3>Stormproof Torch</h3><p>A stormproof lighter is pretty much a long stick-type lighter that burns a small flame on the click of a switch. It is reliable, easy to use, and compact.</p><h3>Granulated Fire Starter</h3><p>These eco-friendly fire starters are ideal for camping since even their ash can be used as fertilizer meaning you're leaving no footprints in nature. These fire starters are suitable for any weather conditions including snow, sleet, rain, and windy conditions.</p><h3>Fire Starter Pucks</h3><p>Made from wood shavings and wax, these pods are convenient, fast, and easy to use. They're often used for BBQ, wood stoves, and fireplaces, but are also ideal for camping since they make starting your fire a piece of cake. Once lit with a lighter or match they can burn for 15 to 30 minutes depending on the brand and burn clean without leaving residue or releasing chemical odors.</p>"
rugged smartwatch,"<h2>Types of rugged smartwatches</h2><p>There are many types of rugged smartwatches on the market, each designed for a different purpose. Some are designed for outdoor activities, while others are meant for more technical or demanding jobs. Here is a brief overview of the different types of rugged smartwatches available:</p><h3>Smartphone smartwatches</h3><p>Smartphone smartwatches are more commonly just called smartwatches. These watches are loaded with features. They connect to your smartphone, and they can actually replace your phone altogether when you want to leave your phone behind. You can use your smartphone to make or answer calls, send and receive text messages, open apps, and so much more.</p><p>These styles of rugged smartwatches also include fitness tracking, keeping record of everything from your steps to your heart rate and more.

carbon fiber wallet,"<h2>Types of carbon fiber wallets</h2><p>There are three main types of carbon fiber wallets. Each has its own unique features, so it's important to know which one is right for you. Carbon fiber wallets can be divided into two categories based on the material they're made from.</p><h3>Minimalist</h3><p>Most carbon fiber wallets fall into the minimalist category. Usually, minimalist wallets use two panels of carbon fiber and an elastic band to sandwich your ID and credit cards in place.</p><p>These wallets usually include a money clip as well for your cash. This money clip may simply be the elastic band, or it may be a dedicated clip made with spring steel, carbon fiber, or some other rigid material.</p><h3>Folding</h3><p>Like your dad's old leather, carbon fiber wallets can also sport some classic vibes with a traditional form factor but with their own modern flair. These rarities usually pair high-tech carbon fiber with high-quality, premium leather for a truly sophisticated look.</p><p>Next time you forget your challenge coin, make sure you've got one of these bad boys ready to help you cover the tab.</p><h3>Money clip</h3><p>When even a minimalist wallet isn't minimal enough, consider snagging a carbon fiber money clip instead. For some, a money clip may not be ideal, but if you need something small and lightweight for your gym shorts, the money clip should be perfect for securing your ID, a credit card or two, and a few bills.</p>"
metal detectors,"<h2>Types of metal detectors</h2><p>Metal detectors come in three basic configurations. Each has its place, but you need to know what you're getting into before making a decision.</p><h3>Very low frequency</h3><p>Most recreational metal detectors use very low frequency signals to locate metal objects underground. Simple technology results in a very affordable price. VLF metal detectors are also user-friendly, making them a great choice for beginners.</p><p>The drawback of this style is a limited signal that sometimes struggles to discern between different kinds of feedback. Certain soil types can generate interference that produces false positives. If you're getting into metal detecting for fun or to do small projects around the house, there's nothing wrong with purchasing a VLF metal detector.</p><h3>Multi-frequency</h3><p>Higher up the price range are multi-frequency metal detectors. Rather than the single frequency used by VLF metal detectors, these broaden their output to more effectively search for objects of different sizes in different locations. Many scan all their frequencies simultaneously, while selectable-frequency metal detectors allow the operator to choose which ones to use in any given situation.</p><p>This sophistication does come with a significant jump in price, so these are best left to more experienced hobbyists. If you have room in your budget and the time to practice with one of these.</p><h3>Pulse induction</h3><p>Pulse induction metal detectors benefit from a much more refined signal that offers improved performance in challenging terrains like soil with high mineral content and the salty sand at the beach. These metal detectors fire individual signals hundreds of times every second and interpret the feedback they get from each one. This also allows them to reach depths beyond what you could search with other metal detectors.</p><p>These capabilities make pulse induction metal detectors very popular among people searching for gold or scanning the beach. The advantages are significant and impressive, but the cost is enough to keep them out of reach for most amateurs.</p>"
spyderco edc,"<h2>Types of spyderco EDC knives</h2><p>Spyderco has a knife for every job. There are knives designed for cutting through thick clothing, slicing through cheese, hacking into an apple, and more. The knives you choose will depend on your individual preferences, but there are some things to consider when making your decision.</p><h3>Tactical knife</h3><p>EDC knives designed for tactical situations, such as self defense, military, or law enforcement applications, still often utilize a versatile blueprint, although some may be dedicated defensive knives with an aggressive design.</p><p>While fixed blades serve best in this role, plenty of folders also exist with many taking advantage of quick deployment systems, well-engineered storage setups, and specially-designed grips and scales. Blade shapes can range from more generic drop point and clip point designs to more aggressive tanto, spear, hawksbill, or talon patterns.</p><h3>Utility knife</h3><p>A Spyderco knife designed for general utility is the quintessential EDC blade, a knife designed to serve as a jack of all trades. Not designed with any specialized use beyond the nine-to-five daily grind or the campsite to-do list, these knives are an excellent option for the general EDC practitioner.</p><p>Most often, this EDC knife will rely on the general purpose drop point blade or a similar design, such as the leaf or clip point blades. Both straight and partially serrated blades are common, although fully serrated blades are much more rare.</p>"
climbing sticks,"<h2>Types of climbing sticks</h2><p>There are several types of climbing sticks on the market. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Lone</h3><p>Lone climbing sticks are the most basic type of climbing stick, and they are typically the most budget-friendly option. Lone climbing sticks are available in a variety of different styles and sizes. Many lone climbing sticks can be customized to fit the size of tree that you will be using them on.</p><p>This type of climbing stick is set up in a very similar manner to the way in which tree sticks will be set up. They can be made from a variety of different materials with different sized steps, depending on your individual preferences and needs.</p><h3>Tree sticks</h3><p>Tree sticks are a fairly new and modern type of climbing stick. This type of climbing stick is becoming a more popular option due to its ease of use and the fact that it is extremely easy to set up. Tree sticks have a look similar to a rope ladder, and they will fit easily with most types and sizes of trees.</p><p>This type of climbing stick features a metal tube in the center, with steps on alternating sides of the tube to form a ladder. Multiple tree sticks can be stacked together on the same tree to extend to a greater height if needed.</p><h3>Tree steps</h3><p>Tree steps are another popular type of climbing stick that are fairly easy to use and set up. This type of climbing stick is a set of metal steps that simply screw into the trunk of the tree. Tree steps are one of the most portable options on the market because there are no extra poles or ropes needed to carry with you.</p><p>Tree steps make a good option to screw into a tree and leave them there for the season. One issue with tree steps is that you will want to make sure they are secured properly and safely before attempting to use them to climb the tree.</p>"
hydration pack,"<h2>Types of hydration packs</h2><p>Hydration packs come in many different shapes and sizes. It's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Classic Camelbak</h3><p>The classic Camelbak style hydration pack is slim and lightweight with very little extra storage capacity. These packs rely solely on the shoulder and chest straps to keep the bag in place while you ride.</p><h3>Backpack Style Bags</h3><p>Hydration packs are the largest of the and they're typically designed for hikers or cyclists. While they may look a lot like a regular backpack from the outside, they're equipped with special pockets in the main chamber to suspend a hydration bladder and keep it separate from other gear.</p><p>Offering more luggage carrying capacity than a Classic Camelbak these hydration packs are ideal for longer rides where you'll need to carry spare kit and a bit of lunch. The luggage carrying capacity of these bags is measured in litres.</p><h3>Vests</h3><p>Like a classic Camelbak hydration vests are minimal packs that just hold the essentials alongside your water. The hydration bladder sits flat on your back and there are often extra storage pockets in the straps for easy access to essential items</p><p>Hydration vests are designed with runners and fast packers in mind. They fit much more tightly to the body and generally have 500-milliliter water bottles on the front of the shoulder straps. Many can also accommodate a hydration bladder. Most have two sternum straps, omit a hipbelt, and have multiple pockets around the vest to stow gear.</p><h3>Waist packs</h3><p>Waist packs are the smallest of the lot and resemble a fanny pack designed to carry a single water bottle. They're good for shorter excursions where you don't need to carry a lot of other gear.</p><p>While they carry less fluid and kit than a backpack the advantage of a waist or hip pack is that it keeps the additional weight low down on your body. This helps to keep your centre of gravity low so the pack doesn't compromise your performance on the bike.</p>"
nato straps,"<h2>Types of nato straps</h2><h3>Classic</h3><p>Classic Nylon NATO Strap or Classic NATO Strap is the most common watch strap found in the market. Yet, it is very popular, beautiful, and has good functionality. A classic nylon NATO strap is made using a single piece of fabric.</p><p>Usually, nylons are being used to make the fabric of a classic NATO strap. A classic nylon NATO strap is attached to a watch differently. Not like the system of a single pass NATO strap.</p><h3>Single-pass</h3><p>A single-pass NATO strap is a much older style of strap. It's a simple single strip of cloth with a buckle on one side and eyelets on the other. The advantage is that they're incredibly slim, so they won't make your watch feel bulky, but the disadvantage is that because it's a single strap, the watch will slide along the band.</p><h3>Dual-pass</h3><p>A dual-pass strap fits like a single-pass version except the watch fits on a second strap attached to the main strap, so it won't slide around the band. The inherent advantage is stability, but the disadvantage is the two layers of cloth make the watch noticeably taller.</p><h3>Two-piece</h3><p>A two-piece NATO strap isn't a NATO strap at all. While they have similar characteristics to NATO straps like nylon fabric, they're just traditional watch straps, so each piece attaches to one end of the watch, which means you'll probably need spring bar tools.</p>"
6 person tents,"<h2>Types of 6-person tents</h2><p>Tent type is the first thing you need to consider when buying a tent. The options range from traditional two-man tents to large family tents with room for six people. There are three main categories for these tents. Each category has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Dome-shaped tents</h3><p>One of the most widely available tent styles, dome-shaped tents are freestanding and take on an arch-like structure. While they may have a peak height of over six feet, they do cave in on all sides, making them feel a bit less spacious than tents with more vertical walls.</p><p>This does mean, however, that they hold up better in the wind, as the slanted tent sides do a better job with deflection. These tents are typically fairly simple to set up and can feature ample storage space, including vestibules.</p><h3>Cabin tents</h3><p>Cabin tents are known for their nearly vertical walls and often offer more room for you and your gear than traditional dome-shaped tents. Some of these options take on an almost rectangular shape, and some still slant out on the sides, while still maintaining their upright shape.</p><p>These tents also often feature vestibules for gear storage, or they have options to extend the rainfly as an awning using trekking poles. The downside of these tents is they often don't stand up well against strong winds, since their sides are so vertical.</p><h3>Instant tents</h3><p>Pretty self-explanatory, these tents are known for their ability to be set up almost instantly. Oftentimes, the poles will be pre-attached to the tent fabric, removing at least one step of the process. These tents are also very easy to take down and are a great option for newer campers looking to not waste time dealing with a tent.</p>"
survival radios,"<h2>Types of survival radios</h2><p>Survival radios are a mixed bag. You can get a cheap option that barely works or spend hundreds on something that's built to last. The key is knowing what you're getting into. Here's a breakdown of the different options available, with pros and cons for each.</p><h3>Amateur ""Ham"" radio</h3><p>Amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is the use of the radio frequency spectrum for purposes of non-commercial exchange of messages, wireless experimentation, self-training, private recreation, radiosport, contesting, and emergency communications.</p><p>Radio amateurs are limited to a small set of frequency bands, the amateur radio bands, allocated throughout the radio spectrum, but within these bands are allowed to transmit on any frequency using a variety of voice, text, image, and data communications modes. This enables communication across a city, region, country, continent, the world, or even into space.</p><h3>AM/FM survival radios</h3><p>AM/FM survival radios, which are also often called simply emergency radios, are able to pick up AM and FM radio frequencies. They'll keep you informed on the latest information when you're in a developing situation, allowing you to access both local radio stations and those that are farther away.</p><p>Your average AM/FM survival radio features multiple power options, like a hand crank, solar charging, and traditional wall outlet or battery power. This ensures you'll be able to use your radio even when your access to electricity is nonexistent. These radios can also include survival extras, like a built-in flashlight, an emergency alert sound, and extra battery power.</p><h3>Weather alert survival radios</h3><p>A weather alert survival radio is a more specialized kind of emergency device. These radios are able to broadcast alerts from NOAA, giving you critical information about weather in your area. You can even fine-tune your alerts if you choose a weather alert radio that includes Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) capability.</p><p>Many weather alert models also allow you to tune in to local radio stations for updates and alerts beyond the weather. This versatility can be especially handy in a survival situation. Additionally, you'll find options with flashlights, emergency lights or alerts, backup battery power, and more.</p>"
tritium watches,"<h2>Types of tritium watches</h2><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tritium has long been a staple in the world of tactical gear. It's used in lensatic compasses to aid in night land navigation. Firearms have incorporated tritium into their night sights for decades. It only makes sense that you'd want this technology in your watch.</p><p>Tritium is placed into watches in the form of tiny vials, or tubes, rather than being painted on in a liquid form. With vials marking the hands and face, you can easily keep track of time without lighting up a digital screen or giving away your position with a flashlight. Tritium is also compatible with night vision optics.</p><h3>Formal</h3><p>Just because you want the practicality of a watch face that's visible at night doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to watches designed for a combat zone. Formal tritium watches add luminous technology to stylish timepieces fit for a night on the town. Careful design integrates luminous vials into timeless watch faces beautifully.</p><p>Popular brands offer watches that look as great as they perform. Not only can you class up an outfit with a gold or silver watch, but you can also take a midnight swim without worrying about damaging it. That's perfect for all those black-tie affairs (or beach barbeques) you go to.</p><h3>Dive</h3><p>Dive watches are intended for extensive use underwater and are held to a higher standard than other watches. Because of the added water pressure experienced at depth, these watches must adhere to incredibly strict quality standards to prevent malfunction. Divers also expect practical design cues like tritium and large numerals that are easy to read in conditions with poor visibility.</p><p>Because of this build quality, dive watches have also evolved into a bit of a status symbol. Even collectors who never intend to dive appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into a good dive watch and are willing to pay to own one.</p>"
tool box,"<h2>Types of tool boxes</h2><p>Tool boxes come in many different sizes and styles. The most important thing to consider is how much space you have available for tools, so make sure your purchase is within your budget. There are several options to choose from, but we found the best ones by looking at what they're used for.</p><h3>Handheld</h3><p>Small, portable tool boxes have been around as long as there have been job sites. Handheld tool boxes are intended to carry the essentials; not every tool you might need. Traditionally, these were made from stamped metal and used a drop-in tray to separate large and small items.</p><p>Some also have clever features like clear panels so you can see through the lid before rummaging around for something you need. If you only have a few tools, this is the way to go. It's also what we'd recommend for transporting part of your collection to an off-site project.</p><h3>Rolling Toolboxes</h3><p>Portable rolling toolboxes are the most convenient option for homeowners, carpenters, or plumbers. They are made from high-density plastic, which makes them durable. The best thing about portable rolling tool boxes is that they have wheels; sometimes two and sometimes four, and this feature makes it super easy for owners to move these toolboxes around the job site.</p><p>They come with compartments and drawers that allow the user to not only arrange tools in a proper manner but also retrieve them easily, without having to dig around in an unorganized mess.</p><h3>Workbench</h3><p>Roll-around toolboxes with a workbench are almost identical to regular roll-around toolboxes. The only difference is that the workbench variety has a proper workbench on the top instead of a closed compartment. You can store more compare to handheld option whre you can turn your garage into a tidy work station.</p><p>The workbench is usually made of a composite material or wood. Most commonly, these toolboxes are made of aluminum or steel. Some varieties of these toolboxes come with a height adjustment feature that allows you to adjust the height of the workbench.</p><h3>Truck tool boxes</h3><p>As the name indicates, truck-mounted toolboxes are meant to be mounted on trucks. Since tools can be extremely heavy, you cannot carry around a toolbox with you when you have to travel. If you often have to carry heavy tools with you, a truck-mounted toolbox is what you should consider getting.</p><p>Truck tool boxes mount to the bed from the inside, so only you can remove them. Locking lids let you secure your tools and keep them protected from the elements. Inside, there's a huge amount of space for large power tools, multiple handheld tool boxes, and even your lunch. They also leave several inches of space between the bottom of the box and the bed of your truck so you can still fit things like plywood underneath.</p>"
tactical sunglasses,"<h2>Types of tactical sunglasses</h2><p>Tactical sunglasses are designed for use in the field. They need to be durable, lightweight, and affordable. Tactical sunglasses can range from simple safety glasses with a tinted lens to more advanced optics like those found on the military's highest-end binoculars.</p><h3>Interchangeable lens kit</h3><p>A number of tactical sunglasses kits which come with a collection of interchangeable lenses and a single pair of frames. Most often, these kits will include a non-polarized set of lenses without any polarization and one or two additional pairs of lenses: clear and/or low-light (yellow, amber, copper, etc.).</p><p>Oftentimes, replacement lenses are available from the manufacturer, so if glare is an issue, you can always supplement your kit with a new pair of polarized lenses.</p><h3>Prescription sunglasses</h3><p>Some of the best tactical operators in the world couldn't hit the broadside of a barn without their prescription lenses. There are options that will fit over traditional eyeglasses or you could settle for wearing contacts with regular sunglasses; however, tactical environments are not particularly forgiving of either solution.</p><p>As such, investing in a pair of prescription shades with the ballistic performance to keep you in the fight. The only downside with this solution is the extra cost and the need to order from either the manufacturer or the optician.</p><h3>Asian fit</h3><p>The human body is simultaneously uniform and unique, and the same goes for our facial structure. Most standard tactical sunglasses are designed around the dimensions of the average Caucasian face shape, but ballistic shades made to these specs are not well-suited to fit many individuals of East Asian or Pacific Rim heritage.</p><p>Many ethnically Asian or Pacific Islander individuals need a pair of ballistic sunglasses with a proper nose bridge, lens shape, and frame curvature to accommodate their face shape in such a way as to provide adequate protection from both sun and debris. Many brands offer Asian fit sunglasses, although a number of them use different descriptors, such as omni fit, universal fit, or low bridge fit to name a few.</p>"
tactical gloves,"<h2>Types of tactical gloves</h2><p>Tactical gloves are designed for use in tactical environments. Tactical gloves come in a variety of different types to accommodate different uses.</p><h3>All Terrain</h3><p>It is important to note that they do not all serve the same purpose. While all types of tactical gloves are designed with certain activities in mind, such as using a firearm, the different types each have their own unique qualities. An all-terrain glove is not necessarily the same as a sniper's gauntlet or a needlestick.</p><p>An all-terrain glove is simply a tactical glove that can be used in any setting or conditions. This type of glove is manufactured to be durable enough to withstand any type of weather or conditions. This can mean things like it gives great grip even when wet to combat or something along the lines of being cut resistant and impact proof for added durability.</p><p>These gloves can have different features like fingerprint technology to allow for device use, padded knuckles for added protection, or other features designed to make these gloves durable and multi-functional, which makes them a basic glove for many tactical professionals.</p><h3>Sniper's Gauntlets</h3><p>This is a glove designed specifically for sniper shooters in the line of duty. Designed to have more dexterity than your typical all-terrain or shooting gloves, these are made especially for shooting snipers.</p><p>They often thinner and less protective than most all-terrain gloves. The focus is on the grip and being able to move your fingers with ease in a hurry as opposed to being super durable or protective.</p><h3>Needlestick</h3><p>When looking at the different types of tactical gloves, needlestick gloves are another specialty glove for tactical professionals. These gloves are designed to protect against needles penetrating the glove and skin.</p><p>These are especially useful for law enforcement officers working in certain urban settings or on drug raids where the potential occurrence of a needle piercing the skin are increased. These gloves can still have the same features as all-terrain or regular shooting gloves, but they also have the added and sole purpose of protecting against needle punctures.</p>"
slip joint knives,"<h2>Types of Slip Joint Knives</h2><p>Slip-joint knives are designed to cut through tough materials like leather or plastic. Slip-joint knives are also known as pocket knives because they can be concealed in the user's pocket.</p><h3>Single-blade</h3><p>Slip joint knives frequently appear in a single-blade variant. Most often, these little blades are pen knives, descendants of the original blades used to sharpen quill pens and similar writing tools.</p><p>These knives, as the name indicates, have a single folding blade. Some single-blade slip joints employ other blade shapes, such as the versatile clip point or the handy straight back, an ideal tool for skinning and similar outdoor chores.</p><h3>Multi-blade</h3><p>Due to their creation as early EDC blades, slip joint knives most often house multiple blades in order to increase their overall versatility. Each blade will differ from the others, usually leveraging a unique shape and size compared to its roommates.</p><p>One example is the stockman pattern knife, an old standby among cowboys and ranchers. Each blade in a knife is distinct in terms of shape and size. A classic example is the stockman knife with a big clip point blade, sheepsfoot blade, and shorter spey blade.</p>"
safety glasses,"<h2>Types of safety glasses</h2><p>Safety glasses come in all kinds of different configurations. Your eyes are sensitive and they need protection, especially when working with equipment that can cause burns or create flying debris that may penetrate the eye. Keep your eyes protected by selecting the right pair of safety glasses for the job.</p><h3>Sunglasses</h3><p>Landscapers and countless other outdoor professionals need to protect themselves from both visible and invisible threats to their eyesight. These safety glasses provide the same protection one would expect from traditional safety glasses with the added bonus of tinted lenses designed to protect against the assault of the sun.</p><p>Whether you need simple UVA and UVB protection or anti-glare polarization on top of ultraviolet protection, there are plenty of options available on today's market.</p><h3>Prescription-friendly</h3><p>If you wear prescription glasses on any sort of a regular basis, you understand the pain and frustration of finding safety glasses that fit over your glasses while still providing proper protection from flying debris, dripping oil, and other hazards. Thankfully, there are a number of designs for safety glasses that were made with you in mind.</p><h3>Anti-particle</h3><p>Small, airborne particles can be a significant concern for some individuals, but anti-particle safety glasses can save the day. An intermediate option between basic safety glasses and full-fledged safety goggles, anti-particle safety glasses use frame gaskets, usually made with closed-cell foam, to create a tight seal between the already minimal space between the frame and your face.</p><p>Often, these gaskets will include ridges with very small gaps on the face-side of the gasket in order to minimize the inevitable fogging that comes with a complete seal.</p><h3>Ballistic</h3><p>Ballistic safety glasses or shooting glasses take traditional safety glasses and add in a few features you would expect on the range. Shooting glasses often come in a variety of lens colors to accommodate different lighting situations with some models offering interchangeable lenses to decrease the number of frames you need to store in your range bag.</p><p>For those planning to head downrange, top-end offerings include ballistic-rated frames, replacing basic plastics with beefed-up polymers designed to withstand some serious flying debris.</p>"
rescue knife,"<h2>Types of rescue knives</h2><p>There are many different types of rescue knives on the market, but you can narrow down your search by knowing what you need.</p><h3>EMT Knife</h3><p>EMT's rescue knife packs a lot of punch into a little package. In a rescue situation, the line cutter allows you to cut without opening it and the handy window smasher allows you to break through thick glass windows.</p><p>EMS/EMT knives are tough, durable blades designed to facilitate quick administration of emergency care, usually offering a (partially) serrated edge, blunt tip, glass breaker, belt or strap cutters, and single-handed opening for maximum effectiveness.</p><h3>Water Rescue Knife</h3><p>Divers may need to use an aquatic blade knife to cut fish lines that have been entangled around marine life or to tap on tanks to draw the attention of a companion. Water rescue knives, however, are quite unique.</p><p>In maritime environments, rope and saltwater are your rescue knife's biggest adversaries, so a highly corrosion-resistant knife with a serrated blade in a sheepsfoot or Wharncliffe pattern is an absolute must. Rafting knives, however, usually possess blunted spear tip blades and a more affordable stainless steel construction.</p><h3>Tactical Knife</h3><p>A tactical knife has one or more military qualities and is designed to be used in dangerous situations. Tactical rescue knives are little different from EMS knives for they have a sharp tip and subdued coloring.</p>"
windproof lighter,"<h2>Types of windproof lighters</h2><p>Windproof lighters are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions. They can be found in a variety of sizes and shapes.</p><h3>Plasma lighters</h3><p>Arc lighters, or plasma lighters, are another windproof option. These lighters don't rely on fuel; instead, they use electricity to generate a flame that looks nothing like a traditional flame. Arc lighters run on rechargeable batteries, and they use two electrodes at one end to spark fire. With the push of a button, an electrical arc appears between the electrodes, and that arc will light whatever placed in its path.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of an arc or plasma lighter is the ease of use. You don't have to refill any fuel, and the battery can be recharged via USB like most modern gadgets. There's no flame to worry about when you need to start a fire, the electricity and electrodes will get the job done.</p><h3>Fuel-based lighters</h3><p>Fuel-based lighters are traditional; you're very likely already carrying a fuel-based lighter. But fuel-based windproof lighters are a little different from the average lighter. These lighters typically run on butane, and they emit flames that are supposed to be strong enough to stay lit when wind is blowing.</p><p>Many fuel-based windproof lighters are also double flame torch lighters, which gives you extra power and double the flame output to withstand wind. They're easy to use and they're excellent for lighting campfires and getting grills fired up. They're quite versatile too. However, when they run out of fuel, you're out of firepower. Even with two flames, the wind can still knock out your light source if it's blowing fiercely.</p><h3>Coil lighters</h3><p>Coil lighters are also called Tesla coil lighters. They're pretty similar to plasma lighters for they don't actually create a flame when used as a lighter. Instead, they use Nikola Tesla's high-voltage, low-current electrical coil to spark a fire.</p><p>The coil generates a high-heat electric arc. With no fuel needed, a coil lighter turns energy into a spark that can withstand even the windiest and most gale-like conditions outdoors. Like arc and plasma lighters, coil lighters don't require any fuel. They also recharge via USB, and you'll get hundreds of uses out of a single charge.</p>"
survival books,"<h2>Types of survival books</h2><p>Survival books come in all shapes and sizes. Some are geared toward specific activities, such as fishing or hunting. Others are more general-purpose and can be used for any survival situation. Still others are designed for a specific type of person, like the Boy Scout leader who wants to teach his sons how to survive.</p><h3>Wilderness survival</h3><p>There is perhaps no quintessential survival situation than the wilderness. It's no surprise that multiple texts have been written about how to survive in the wild. Timeless classics will prove invaluable to neophytes and old-timers alike as they outline potentially hazardous situations and explain the respective survival strategies.</p><p>Wilderness survival books provide instruction on the essentials: purifying water, protecting yourself from the elements and wild animals, and shopping in nature]s grocery store. Learn which berries are safe, which roots have medicinal properties, and which mushrooms will fire you straight into another universe (slow down, that's not a good thing).</p><h3>Emergency preparedness</h3><p>Danger seems to lurk in just about every space in our modern-day congested urban places. You certainly require a practical handbook to prepare you for any eventuality in your home, office, or car. For instance, fires, automobile accidents, natural catastrophes, mugging, etc.</p><p>Books on emergency preparedness will cover topics like natural disasters, resource gathering, and conflict resolution. Facing resource shortages in populated areas comes with its own challenges, and they're no less serious than what you'd face in the wilderness. Learn how to make the most of what you have when societal infrastructure fails you.</p><h3>Off-grid living</h3><p>Survival books about prepping and off-grid living will teach you to be more self-sufficient and resourceful. In the worst-case scenario, you'll be prepared to thrive instead of just surviving. Until then, you'll gain peace of mind and maybe even a hobby or two. It can't hurt to reduce your reliance on others.</p><p>Foraging wild plants and herbs in an emergency situation can be a dangerous affair for most of us. Therefore, a collection of fine handbooks that cover this subject in satisfying detail are indispensable.</p>"
waterproof bluetooth speaker,"<h2>Types of waterproof Bluetooth speakers</h2><p>Bluetooth speakers come in a variety of different sizes and shapes, but there are some things you need to know about before making your purchase. Here's a breakdown of the most common options so you can make an informed decision.</p><h3>Portable Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Portable Bluetooth speakers are one of the most popular choices. These handy speakers are both waterproof and designed to be taken anywhere. Compact in size, portable speakers come in all different kinds of compact packages, from slim squares to small circles.</p><p>The biggest advantage of a portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker is its versatility. You can use these speakers at home, in your garage, or absolutely anywhere outdoors. It's the perfect choice for those who want to take their audio on the go without being weighed down by a bulky device.</p><h3>Full-size Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Also be called stationary speakers, are the exact opposite of portable models. These speakers are larger and heavier, and they're meant to be placed in one spot. They're also a really great option for large outdoor spaces, like your backyard. If you're looking for waterproof Bluetooth speakers that you'll use in just one place, a full-size speaker is your best bet.</p><h3>Mounted Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Another variety of stationary speaker is a mounted Bluetooth speaker. These speakers tend to be quite compact in size, and they mount in place to items like walls, patio overhangs, and other indoor or outdoor structures.</p><p>As a more specialized kind of waterproof Bluetooth speakers, mounted models are a bit more limited. However, this style of speaker can create some really great sound quality, and it enables you to easily control your outdoor entertainment right from your smartphone or other Bluetooth-equipped devices.</p>"
tourniquet,"<h2>Types of tourniquets</h2><p>Tourniquets are designed for different uses. There's a reason why they're called ""tourniquets"" in the first place, and it's important to know what you need before you buy. Here's a breakdown of the most common types of tourniquets.</p><h3>Military Emergency Tourniquet (MET)</h3><p>This lightweight tourniquet is made of an aluminum windlass and a strong strap. It opens up completely for placement around a limb. It doesn't need to be totally cinched before you engage the windlass. When you need to tie it loosely, turning the windlass can loosen it. The tourniquet has two tightening features for locking the windlass after use. One has Velcro while the other is adjustable.</p><h3>Emergency Medical Tourniquet (EMT)</h3><p>This is a pneumatic tourniquet that resembles a blood pressure cuff. However, the tourniquet has a stronger securing mechanism and a reinforced pneumatic bladder that prevents air loss when it inflates. These maintain pressure on the limb once the tourniquet is applied. The EMT is an easy-to-use, open-loop tourniquet that compresses even when loosely applied. It is larger and costlier than many windlass tourniquets.</p><h3>Combat Application Tourniquet (CAT)</h3><p>This is one of the oldest tourniquets in existence and is commonly used by the military. It comes in different models. However, it's important to use the most recent model as it is more effective. The tourniquet features a closed-loop system limited to a 3-inch uptake. The windlass only has one locking point and the strap is secured with Velcro. The strap is routed through the buckle differently; it all depends on whether the tourniquet is used on a lower or upper extremity.</p><h3>Mechanical Advantage Tourniquet (MAT)</h3><p>This tourniquet is made from plastic shaped like a ""C"" for easy application around the limb. It is manufactured in two sizes: one for the leg and the other for the arm. It utilizes a closed-loop system and its strap can be quickly attached and detached. The tourniquet's internal tightening mechanism is a plastic dial that can be turned. This tourniquet has a lower uptake because the strap must be secured before the internal system is engaged.</p>"
gun belts,"<h2>Types of gun belts</h2><p>Gun belts come in all kinds of different configurations. Gun belts can be made out of leather or nylon webbing. There's a gun belt for every occasion, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Gun Holster Belt</h3><p>One of the biggest factors you want to look for in a concealed carry gun belt is adjustability, especially if you are using a gun holster. A gun holster is the leather pouch that holds your firearm. Many people love holsters for EDC (every day carry) because they keep the gun safe and protected and the muzzle of the gun is not constantly jabbing into you all day long. A gun holster tends to allow for the gun to not move around as much either.</p><h3>Concealed Carry Gun Belt</h3><p>If you ask anyone who has a concealed carry gun, they will tell you that the number one characteristic of a EDC gun belt that they are looking for is comfort. After all, you may be wearing your gun on you for up to 18 hours a day, especially if you are law enforcement, off-duty or undercover police officers, or in the military. In fact, there are many people who don't carry on-person due to the fact it is uncomfortable. Plus, they worry that their EDC firearm won't be concealed properly under their clothes, which defeats the purpose of wearing one as well.</p><h3>Tactical Gun Belt</h3><p>If you look at the word ""tactical"" carefully, you will see the word ""tactics."" Tactics are actions or strategies that are carefully planned in order to achieve a specific end. In the military, tactics refer to the methods you will use to dispose of your opponent. Thus, a tactical belt is designed to help support these ends and hold whatever you need in order to do so.</p><h3>All-Around Gun Belt</h3><p>For gun belts, you are looking for a belt that is sturdy, easy to use, doesn't twist, and aesthetically pleasing. You want a reliable concealed carry belt that can both hold your gun in place and distribute the weight of your holster and firearm. You also want an all-around gun belt that can be worn at other times when you are not carrying.</p><h3>Dress Gun Belt</h3><p>When you think of a gun belt, you may be thinking that you'll just have to compromise and get a gun belt that you really don't like the looks of for one that is functional. Dress belts are belts that are worn for a bit more formal occasion, such as a nice dinner out or to a wedding. That being said, there is no cut and dry clarity when it comes to what a dress belt must look like. Being fully-adjustable, you can rest assured that you won't be spending time pulling up your pants, and you will be able to adjust your dress gun belt to fit your EDC firearm perfectly and comfortably.</p>"
rangefinders,"<h2>Types of rangefinders</h2><p>Rangefinders come in all shapes and sizes. There's a reason for that, though. You need to pick the right tool for the job. Here are some tips on how to narrow down your search.</p><h3>Basic models</h3><p>Basic model rangefinders typically come with limited mode options. These rangefinders may be hit or miss when it comes to offering angle range compensation, so you'll want to do your research before you make your purchase. These rangefinders will usually allow you to switch between yards and meters, give you an angle reading, and have a speed setting for ranging things on the move. Typically, as the price goes up, the more functionality you'll get.</p><h3>Ballistic models</h3><p>Rangefinders in this category will have built-in software that can offer a hunter a ballistics solution along with their range readings. The hunter is able to tailor their rangefinder to their specific needs, entering things like environmental data and cartridge information. What results is specific recommendations for sight adjustments based on all gathered data.</p><h3>Bluetooth-capable</h3><p>A few rangefinders on the market can now use Bluetooth capabilities to sync with either a smart scope of the same brand or a cell phone app. Range, environment, and ballistics information is relayed to the connected device which then either syncs accordingly or offers adjustment solutions for the best possible shot.</p><h3>Binocular rangefinders</h3><p>Some binoculars have rangefinders built right into them. If you're looking to cut down on the number of items you need to keep track of in the field, a binocular and rangefinder combo might be the way to go. Keep in mind, though, that these binoculars are often much heavier and harder to operate with only one hand like a traditional rangefinder.</p>"
stainless steel cookware,"<h2>Types of stainless steel cookware</h2><p>Stainless steel is a great choice for cooking because it's easy to clean and holds up well against heat. There are several different kinds of stainless steel cookware, so you need to know what you're getting into before making your purchase. Here's a breakdown of the most common options.</p><h3>Clad stainless steel</h3><p>The most popular type because it's a blend of two metals: copper and stainless steel. This makes for even heat distribution and prevents any hotspots from developing. The downside to this type is that it can be quite expensive.</p><p>Stainless steel is easy to clean, but non-stick coatings are just about effortless. Some stainless steel pots and pans incorporate these slick coatings so you can spend more time enjoying your meal and less time side-eying the cheese that's hardening to your cookware. If you tend to cook dishes that are hard to clean up, a non-stick coating could be for you.</p><h3>Tri-ply stainless steel</h3><p>This is made of three layers - an inner layer of aluminum for even heat distribution, a middle layer of stainless steel for durability, and an outer layer of copper for better heat conductivity. This type is less expensive than clad but doesn't offer the same benefits.</p><p>As good as stainless steel is, some cooks prefer other metals that distribute heat from the stove to the rest of the pot or pan quickly, so you can get cooking in less time. Some stainless steel cookware is designed with an aluminum or copper base to get the best of both worlds. These more conductive metals are only present on the bottom. While aluminum and copper are superior heat conductors, they are also softer. That means they scratch easily, so you'll need to be more careful with them.</p><h3>Purely stainless steel</h3><p>Solid stainless steel cookware is just made of one metal, stainless steel - so it doesn't have the same benefits as the other two types. Stainless steel is so well-suited for cooking that you don't have to complicate the formula to get great cookware. It's conductive, consistent, easy to clean, and tougher than nails. High-end cookware is built to be hefty for better heat distribution.</p><p>Without any other materials, all-stainless steel cookware is as durable as it gets. Use metal spoons and spatulas. Scrub away without worrying about scratches. Throw it in the dishwasher. This style of cookware makes cooking a delight and cleanup a breeze.</p>"
two way radio,"<h2>Types of two-way radios</h2><p>There are three main types of two-way radios, and they're all covered in this guide.</p><h3>Amateur ham radios</h3><p>Amateur or ham radio is intended for hobby and personal use. Amateur radio operates on UHF, VHF and some HF frequencies using using International Morse Code, voice communication, data, pictures and even video. Ham radios are available as handheld transcievers (walkie talkies), mobile rigs for use in vehicles, and base stations.</p><p>A license is required to operate an amateur radio and there are three levels of licensing that determine which bands and frequencies an amateur operator is allowed to access. There is no minimum age requirement to become an amateur or ham radio operator. Amateur radio falls under Part 97 of the FCC rules.</p><p>These radios usually consist of a large central structure that links to an external antenna. Though you can find some mobile options, they are still far less convenient than other options.</p><h3>Citizen's band radios</h3><p>CB offers Two-way radio communications for personal or business use. CB service operates on 40 shared channels in an AM mode or Single SideBand (SSB) mode. No individual license is required and there is no minimum age requirement to operate a CB radio. CB radios are still commonly used today, particularly on the road. Citizen's Band falls under Part 95 of the FCC rules.</p><p>Designed for business and personal applications, these two-way radios often come at a higher price point than GMRS counterparts. These radios have access to 40 channels in AM settings and in Single SideBand mode. However, as a result of the fact that these channels are shared, it is not a desirable system for secure communications.</p><h3>FRS and GMRS</h3><p>Short for Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service, these bandwidths are built for business, personal, and recreational use.</p><p>FRS is available for personal or business use. Transmit power on an FRS channel is limited to a maximum of 2 watts. Optimal range on an FRS channel is about 2 miles, however the typical range is about a quarter mile or less. There are 22 FRS channels available. No license is required for FRS and there are no age restrictions to use it.</p><p>GMRS is available for personal use and is a popular choice among consumers and many radio hobbyists for use in many operations and activities. Optimal range on a GMRS portable handheld radio is about 2 miles, however the typical range depends largely on location and terrain. There are 30 GMRS channels available. A license is required for GMRS, however, one license covers the entire family with no age restrictions.</p>"
neck knives,"<h2>Types of neck knives</h2><p>Some neck knives are designed for utility, while others are designed for self-defense. Still others are designed for both purposes. Whatever the purpose, neck knives offer a convenient way to keep a sharp blade close at hand. There are two basic types of knives: single-edged and double-edged neck knives.</p><h3>Single-edged Knife</h3><p>The single-edged knife can have either a pointed blade or a smooth blade. If the blade is point, it will catch the skin more quickly and leave little or no injury if it cuts. The smooth blade is more comfortable to hold, but it does not leave as much protection against cuts as the pointed blade. If you choose a single-edged blade for use in the event of an attack, keep in mind that your assailant may also have a knife, so you may be forced to fight.</p><h3>Double-edged knife</h3><p>Double-edged knives have a curved blade that presents the potential for more injury if the handle catches or crushes the skin. Some double-bladed knives are also referred to as ""zipper knives"". If you are attacked, keep this type of knife in your waistband or on your belt where you can easily reach it. The former may be a factor if you are grabbed from behind.</p><p>Some double-edged knives are made from materials that cannot withstand too much force. The design of these knives will often times feature a one-piece construction. This one-piece construction will be made up of a handle, blade and a lock to prevent the blade from turning. These locks will be designed to be kicked through a hinge while the handle is open.</p>"
rechargeable flashlight,"<h2>Types of rechargeable flashlights</h2><p>There are a lot of options when it comes to buying a rechargeable flashlight. The good news is that most of them can be categorized into one of these groups, so you can narrow down your search based on what you need.</p><h3>Pocket</h3><p>Pocket flashlights are excellent choices for everyday carry because they are small, lightweight, and convenient. But beware for not all pocket flashlights guarantee durable, long-lasting performance.</p><p>Pocket flashlight designers place miniature size at a premium, so small models cannot typically accommodate the heavier batteries that provide extended use between charges. The best rechargeable flashlight for pocket carry combines build quality, durability, brightness, and battery power with compactness and convenience.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tactical flashlights trace their origin to military and police organizations. They're usually designed to military-grade specifications and constructed from durable materials. Tactical flashlights are bright for their size, illuminate large areas, and are useful in many situations.</p><p>Some offer functionality beyond that of a traditional flashlight, such as having a strobe light mode. Tactical flashlights are an attractive option for campers, police officers, soldiers, hikers, and anyone else who needs a bright, durable flashlight that packs well in a hiking pack or toolkit.</p><h3>Spotlight</h3><p>Spotlights are ultrabright, capable of a highly focused beam, and typically do not cast light any wider than 45 degrees. They are easy to control and point, often incorporating a pistol grip for enhanced ease of use. Large designs house heavier batteries, making spotlights the best rechargeable flashlight option for trekking, camping, boating, survival, and other activities with long periods between charging sessions.</p><h3>Headlamps</h3><p>There are certainly times when holding a flashlight in your hand isn't ideal. Headlamps are a great way to get work done in the dark, whether you're doing home repairs in the attic or pitching a tent after a long day of hiking. Rechargeable options eliminate the need to carry batteries around at work or on the trail, and they can even be charged up using a solar bank.</p>"
whetstones,"<h2>Types of whetstones</h2><h3>Oil whetstones</h3><p>The oil stone has been used for many years to sharpen knives and tools. They are a man-made stone having abrasive particles bound together with a bonding agent. The name oil stone refers to the fact that you need oil to lubricate the stone before sharpening with it.</p><p>These stones are natural stones made from either novaculite, aluminum oxide, or silicone carbide. In order to file your knife and sharpen its blade, you'll use oil to lubricate the metal against these stone varieties. Oil whetstones can offer different densities and create different finishes on your knife blades. Most leave behind a polished edge.</p><p>The biggest drawback of an oil whetstone is this kind of sharpening stone tends to cut metal more slowly compared to man-made stones. This slower cutting rate means you'll have to take more time to work on your knife, which can be frustrating. Additionally, because oil is the necessary lubricant, the process can be messy and harder to clean up.</p><h3>Water whetstones</h3><p>Water stones can be either natural or man-made (synthetic) stones. The term water stone is derived from the fact that water must be used to lubricate these stones. Natural Waterstones have been quarried in Belgium and Japan for centuries and hold a special place in sharpening stone history and lore.</p><p>Water whetstones can be made from natural stone but they can also be made from synthetic materials. Typically made of some kind of aluminum oxide variety, these sanding stones are abrasive but soft in their density. This makes water whetstones faster at cutting; they're able to break down old metal easily to sharpen quickly.</p><p>Water is easy to wipe down and clean up once you're done sharpening. There is one disadvantage, water whetstones wear down quickly and they tend to break apart easily which leads to uneven surfaces on your sharpening stone, which can make sharpening knives more difficult.</p><h3>Diamond whetstones</h3><p>Diamond whetstones are the toughest variety you can buy. They're actually made with synthetic small diamonds, which are attached to a metal plate. Those diamonds and their high hardness level cut very quickly, taking blades from dull to sharp in no time at all. There are two kinds of diamond whetstones to choose from: mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline. Both last a long time, but mono-crystalline are the most durable.</p><p>Diamond whetstones sharpen at a fast speed and stay flat even over many uses. There's just one drawback: the cost. These sharpening stones are very expensive, and they're an investment.</p><h3>Arkansas Stones</h3><p>Arkansas Stones deserve their own classification because they can be used with oil or water. They are also called Novaculite a Latin word meaning ""razor stone"". Arkansas stones have been quarried since the early 1800s from bedrock deposits found in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas.</p><p>They are cut into rectangular shaped whetstones to be used for sharpening knives and tools. The Arkansas stone is the most misunderstood of all sharpening abrasives. Arkansas stones come in four grades; Soft, Hard, Black and Translucent.</p>"
shoulder holsters,"<h2>Types of shoulder holsters</h2><p>There are three basic types of shoulder holsters. Each has its place, but you need to know which one is right for you before making a purchase.</p><h3>Vertical Holsters</h3><p>Your first option is a vertical shoulder holster; it is mostly because you'll be using a particularly big carry. Many people swear by it for comfort and ease of use. The vertical shoulder holster requires that your CW will have to be held in an upright or downward position to be carried successfully.</p><p>A vertical shoulder holster is the most uncomfortable of the shoulder holsters. It is generally worn by law enforcement staff. The holsters are built to hold the cw in a vertical position of the body. The barrel will either be pointed upward or the barrel will be pointed downward.</p><h3>Horizontal Holsters</h3><p>The horizontal shoulder holster holds the concealed carry in a horizontal direction from the body. These holsters often position the barrel of the carry to be pointed away from the body of the wearer. This direction is generally pointed behind the individual that is wearing the holsters.</p><p>With either sort of shoulder holster, you may find the holster is worn like that of a backpack. The gun holster is mounted on either one of 2 different straps which are attached to make the holster. This holster may require you to wear a vest or an open jacket to hide the mechanism and CW from being noticed. In these cases, the holster and the gun will be plain and the gun is bigger than an average person will carry in public.</p>"
roof racks cars,"<h2>Types of roof racks</h2><p>There are two types of roof racks. Each has its place, but you need to know which type you're getting into before making a purchase. Roof racks come in four basic configurations: single-wheel, dual-wheels, and quad-wheels.</p><h3>Naked roof</h3><p>There is a common misconception that the plastic strips that run front-to-back on the roof of many modern vehicles is a rain gutter that can be attached to. For rack purposes, this is not a rain gutter. In the rack world, that is a ""Naked Roof"" car; the most common fit solution for this sort of roof is a clip fit.</p><p>Clip Fit roof racks tension around the door frame of cars that have no pre-installed attachment points. These cars can be described as ""Naked Roof"" or ""Bare Roof."" Clip fits require two components; the tower is fairly universal, while the clip or fit kit adapts the tower to fit specific vehicle. These fits require precision measurement to ensure correct installation.</p><h3>Side rails</h3><p>Many SUVs, wagons and crossovers are equipped with factory-installed side rails that run front-to-back on the roof. These typically, though not always, are strong attachment points engineered to support a roof rack system.</p><ul><li>Raised side rails are elevated off the roof such that a tower can be fitted all the way around it. A wide range of raised rail sizes exists; not every tower will fit every side rail.</li><li>Fixed side rails sit directly against the roof and typically have a channel or pin holes for towers to fit into. This style of side rail is relatively new but becoming more widespread.</li></ul><h3>Fixed point</h3><p>There a number of cars that come from the manufacturer with roof rack mounting points built into the roof; and some come with tracks installed on the roof. These allow for a quick, simple installation of base towers. Some examples of cars with fixed mounting points include the Honda Element, many Mazda models, and some Subaru and BMW sedans.</p><p>Fixed point rails and the rack systems they secure are some of the easiest racks to install and use. They're great for cyclists and equally wonderful for taking a short road trip and storing some luggage. In a pinch, they can be used to tie down items and transport them short distances, like large boxes from a store that you need to take across town.</p><h3>Canopy mounts</h3><p>Vehicles with canopies or camper tops have two main options for mounting roof racks. The first is artificial side mount rain gutter brackets - these are installed on the side of the camper/canopy and allow a raingutter tower to be attached to it.</p><p>Second option is a custom track or fixed point installation on the camper or canopy top. These installations are complex, and we don't recommend customers doing it themselves. These setups are usually permanent, but there are some removable options for campers or canopies.</p><p>These are heavy-duty mounts, and as such, are great for long road trips and moving, and especially for large vans and RVs. They allow you to stack equipment high and carry large loads, so using them to move is a snap.</p><h3>Rain gutters</h3><p>Rain gutter roof rack towers attach to the exposed rain gutters ""drip rails"" or ""gutters"" that were standard on most vehicles through the 80's. They can also be found on larger cargo/commercial vans, and certain Jeep/SUVs. Because rain gutter racks have been around for decades, used options are abundant and affordable.</p><p>Sturdy, solid metal, and common in older cars, these care perfect for when you're buying a used van or SUV for use strictly as a vacation vehicle.</p>"
snow chains,"<h2>Types of snow chains</h2><h3>Diamond Tire Chains</h3><p>These are the original types of snow chains. They include strings of metal chain links forming a diamond structure. The diamond pattern size varies depending on the amount of snow or ice you are facing. This type of snow chain ""works together to make a mesh pattern that covers the whole tire. Since this type of chain has a higher contact surface with the ground, it offers the best traction"", meaning these are the best choice for heavy snowfall areas.</p><h3>Cable Tire cables</h3><p>Tire cables are another great option. Because they are generally not as heavy-duty as tire chains, they are best for shorter drives and less frequent use. With that being said, cable chains vary in degrees of intensity, and many of them have extremely high traction performance. Tire cables are excellent options for vehicles that have tires that fill the wheel wells, as they are a less bulky option than tire chains.</p><p>If you live in an area with light or infrequent snowfall, you may want to spend less money while still having the added peace of mind. Tire cables tend to be lighter weight, less expensive, and cause less damage to the roads than tire chains.</p><h3>Tire chains</h3><p>Tire chains link together, creating a web around your tires. They are generally more durable and high-end than any other option for snow chains. Tire chains can be a premium option, but worth every penny. V-bar tire chains take the cake for durability and traction. If you plan to drive in deep snow or on black ice you'll likely want a good set of tire chains.</p><h3>Plastic traction aids</h3><p>Like the ones from Sanku Snow, are rising in popularity. This is because they are inexpensive and overall very easy to use. While these are popular, it is important to note that they are far less durable and reliable than tire chains or tire cables.</p>"
zoom binoculars,"<h2>Types of zoom binoculars</h2><p>Zoom binoculars are great for birdwatching, but they can be a pain in the butt when you're trying to identify a species from a distance. To make things easier, it's important to know what kind of zoom binos you have before you head out on your next nature excursion.</p><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Traditional binoculars have been around for ages, and they're just as useful today as they have ever been. By essentially connecting two tiny telescopes, manufacturers let you see further than you could with the naked eye, but still retain depth perception by using both eyes.</p><p>Adjustments typically include controls for width, focus, and eye relief. If you see black rings or blurry images through your binoculars, the fix is as simple as twisting a few knobs. Most high-end binoculars use a traditional setup. This causes them to be relatively large and heavy, but many people find the optical clarity worthwhile.</p><h3>Compact</h3><p>As good as traditional binoculars are, sometimes you need a smaller, lighter alternative. If you weigh your pack and consider every ounce of gear, saving a little weight here and there matters. If you're out on a hunt and have rifle optics available to you as well, maybe a small pair of binoculars that doesn't get in the way is what you want.</p><p>Compact binoculars use a small unibody construction that not only reduces size and weight, but avoids opportunities to get binocular tubes snagged on your gear or nearby branches. They generally have lower power magnification and smaller-diameter objective lenses as a result.</p><h3>Night vision</h3><p>Just because the sun goes down doesn't mean you have to give up the power of sight. Night vision capability is getting increasingly affordable and we support your endeavor to own the night yourself. There's more to seeing at night than big objective lenses; to truly light up the night, you need actual night vision technology.</p><p>Three easy steps: light enters the device, magic happens, and you can see in the dark. Different devices use different types of magic, but you get the idea. Even if you can't get your hands on military-grade optics, you can still purchase infrared technology and zoom capability. Best of all, they're not that noticeable on your face.</p>"
wood splitting maul,"<h2>Types of wood splitting mauls</h2><p>Wood splitting mauls come in a variety of different sizes and shapes. Each one is designed for a specific type of wood, so it's important to know what you're working with before you buy.</p><h3>Full-size</h3><p>Most mauls feature a long, straight handle and a heavy metal head. Handles are typically around three feet long and are held with two hands. Heads are much thicker than axe heads and don't need to be that sharp. Remember that axes need to cut across the wood grain, whereas mauls drive in between fibers and split them apart along natural seams. Maul heads often feature a striking face on the reverse side for extra force when you need it.</p><p>Traditionally, mauls were built using wood handles that could easily be replaced when they wore out. Metal shims driven into the handle would create a tight fit in the eye of the head. Today, composite handles can last longer and weigh less than wood. Some even have padding for vibration damping.</p><h3>Compact</h3><p>Compact mauls can be a great option for people who don't split wood very often or only split wood at a remote campsite. These tools are usually 12 to 18 inches long and are held with either one or two hands. Their compact size makes them lighter and more portable but they're still too heavy to justify a place in your hiking pack.</p><p>These mauls don't generate near as much force as their full-sized alternatives. You'll have to work harder for the same results, and ultimately be limited by your equipment. Compact mauls split the difference between full-size and wedges, but they don't outperform either.</p><h3>Wedge</h3><p>Rather than learning how to swing a maul with precision, you can take your time driving a wedge into a log and finishing the job with a sledgehammer. Because these tools stay in contact with the wood, they're often easier for beginners to use effectively. Think of wedges as a maul with the handle removed.bOn the downside, you'll need to own a sledgehammer already or purchase one separately. Once you know what you're doing, wedges are also slower to use than a traditional maul.</p>"
tactical boots,"<h2>Types of tactical boots</h2><p>There are many different types of tactical boots on the market, each designed for a specific purpose. Whether you're looking for a boot that will provide ankle support, or one that will keep your feet dry in wet conditions, there's a tactical boot out there that will meet your needs. We'll take a look at some of the most popular types of tactical boots, and explain what sets them apart.</p><h3>Field boots</h3><p>Field boots are the ideal tactical solution for rural and semi-rural settings with limited to no infrastructure. These tactical boots often include a number of unique features designed to handle unique environments. The most common types of field boots are jungle, mountain, and desert boots.</p><ul><li>Jungle boots possess the abilities to drain and dry quickly, breathe easily, deny entrance to creepy crawlies, and bite into slippery terrain.</li><li>Mountain boots leverage aggressive tread patterns for excellent traction and often feature waterproofing, insulation, or both.</li><li>Desert boots feature a breathable construction, usually including dedicated cooling vents and sport-aggressive tread lugs, although slightly less so than their high-altitude brothers in arms.</li></ul><h3>Urban boots</h3><p>Urban tactical boots provide wearers with a pavement-friendly option for operations both in and around buildings or on the street. These boots often are lightweight and bypass bigger tread lugs to minimize weight and drag on smooth surfaces, such as concrete, asphalt, or tile. These boots are more likely than most other tactical boots to incorporate an athletic shoe fit and feel, making them more comfortable than the more traditional field boot.</p><p>While designated as ""urban"", these boots also can be solid choices for wet and industrial combat zones. Urban boots may include anti-slip or oil-resistant outsoles or both in order to increase traction in slick settings.</p><h3>Safety boots</h3><p>Tactical safety boots often look similar, if not identical, to other tactical boots but include a number of unique components that more traditional boots lack. In addition to a relatively aggressive tread, these boots include an internal steel or composite toe cap for reliable protection against toe injuries when working around heavy materials or machinery. Other critical features may also include waterproofing, insulation, and oil-resistant or otherwise slip-resistant outsoles.</p><h3>Speed boots</h3><p>Speed boots are a fairly rare breed of boot. While seemingly identical to running boots, speed boots are the combat-ready equivalent. Running boots are designed for pounding the pavement, making them some of the lightest tactical boots around, but they tend not to hold up well in the field. Speed boots increase the toughness, durability, and traction of a running boot in order to combine the best of both worlds.</p>"
tent stakes,"<h2>Types of tent stakes</h2><p>Tent stakes come in many different sizes, shapes, and materials. Usually being classified with the type of materials used in making tent stakes. Before you buy one, make sure you know what you're getting into. We found the best way to narrow down your options is by breaking them down into categories. Here's a breakdown of the most common types of tent stakes on the market today.</p><h3>Bulky angle iron/aluminum stakes</h3><p>Bulky angle iron/aluminum stakes, are useful for camping in the sand. This type of stake, however, is far from effective for use in hard dirt. Furthermore, these tent stakes are known to lose their effectiveness in rainy conditions.</p><h3>Skewer tent stakes</h3><p>Skewer tent stakes are lightweight and inexpensive. They are straight in shape and are not the best option when holding power is vital. Generally speaking, skewer stakes work the best in grassy terrain. By contrast, bulldog tent stakes are heavier and more capable of holding fast. They don't bend easily and work well in a variety of ground types.</p><h3>Large plastic tent stakes</h3><p>Large plastic tent stakes are often used for family camping. These tent stakes are both lightweight and tough, featuring a large head for easier pounding into the ground. These stakes are less expensive than many other types. Keep in mind that exposure to ultraviolet light may degrade plastic stakes.</p><h3>Snow stakes</h3><p>Snow stakes are designed to be buried sideways in the snow. These stakes are stronger than those designed for general use. Some anchor stakes are designed for use in both snow and sand. They are made to be filled with snow or sand and buried in the ground.</p><h3>Pile driver and Screw tent stakes</h3><p>These types of tent pegs resemble and almost work the same as rock tent pegs. However, their main difference is that the pile driver and screw pegs offer more grip. This is because these tent pegs have a screw-like thread that easily penetrates to the bottom. Furthermore, these pegs are constructed from metal which protects them against bending or breaking.</p><h3>V tent stakes</h3><p>Depending on the height, V tent pegs are a more versatile type. This is because they work great for all ground types. Typically, V tent pegs are ideal for the more crucial parts of the tent such as the main pegging points - four corners and main guyline. Due to their design, V tent pegs also deliver great strength to your tent.</p><h3>Rock tent stakes</h3><p>As the name suggests, rock tent pegs are ideal for hard rocky ground. These tent peg types have a pointed tip which allows you to easily drive them through the rocky ground. They pair best with plastic pegs and V pegs. Simply use them in the hardest or trickiest part of the tent set-up points.</p><h3>Glow-in-the-dark tent stakes</h3><p>You can even find glow-in-the-dark tent stakes that glow throughout the night. These tent stakes are useful for preventing tripping accidents. They are also good for setting up camp during the night.</p>"
survival kit,"<h2>Types of survival kits</h2><p>Survival kits are designed for different purposes. Some are meant to be carried on your person at all times, while others are meant to be stored in a safe place. There is no perfect survival kit because every person has different needs. However, there are some essential items that every survival kit should include.</p><h3>Mini survival kits</h3><p>Mini survival kits are small kits that contain a few basic survival tools. These kits often include a small compass, waterproof matches, minimum fishing tackle, large plastic bag, small candle, jigsaw blade, craft knife or scalpel blade, and a safety pins. Pre-packaged survival kits may also include instructions in survival techniques such as fire-starting or first aid methods.</p><p>In addition, paracord can be wrapped around the tin. They are designed to fit within a container roughly the size of a mint tin. Lightweight survival kits are generally seen as a backup means of survival; however, these kits can be extensive, and have come to include tools that are generally found in larger kits as survival technology advances</p><h3>Emergency kit</h3><p>Emergency Kit is a portable kit containing items that would help a person to survive for 72 hours during an escape or evacuation from an emergency event or disaster such as a hurricane, earthquake, or flood. The focus is on evacuation rather than long-term survival. The kits are also popular in the survivalism subculture.</p><p>An emergency kit is meant to be kept close at hand in case of an emergency. It should include basic supplies like batteries, candles, matches, and water purification tablets. Emergency kits are meant to be compact so they can fit inside a wallet or backpack. They're not meant to be stocked with more than what's needed for a single emergency. If you have room for more, consider purchasing a larger emergency kit.</p><h3>Bug-out bag survival kit</h3><p>A Bug-Out Bag (BOB) is a type of survival kit backpack that is designed for emergency evacuation situations. The idea is that you would grab your BOB and leave your home in the event of a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other emergencies.</p><p>A typical Bug-Out Bag will include supplies like water filters, tents, food rations, clothing, first aid kits, and flashlights. The best thing about having a Bug-Out Bag is that you can just grab it and go if ever needed.</p><h3>Medical kit</h3><p>A medical kit is meant to be kept close at hand in case you need to treat yourself or someone else. It includes items like bandages, gauze, scissors, tweezers, and thermometer. Medical kits are meant to be compact so they can fit inside a pocket or purse. They're not meant to be stocked with more than what's needed for a single emergency. If you have room for more, consider purchasing a larger medical kit.</p>"
1000 lumen flashlight,"<h2>Types of 1000 lumen flashlights</h2><p>The types of 1000 lumen flashlights are differentiated by the power source the flashlights use. Each category has its own unique features, so it's important to know which one you need before you start shopping.</p><h3>Rechargeable battery</h3><p>The most common type of 1000 lumen flashlight, most rechargeable battery lights rely on LED chip technology to create the light beam. You can find models that have removable batteries, similar to a double-A setup that you can charge outside the flashlight. These enable you to switch out the batteries. In some cases, the flashlights enable you to use replaceable batteries, too.</p><p>The more popular design for rechargeable flashlights is with a built-in battery. These connect either via a standard or micro-USB or both. You can charge them on the go or via a wall socket. These flashlights are suitable for times when you know you can restore a charge or are certain you will need it only for a minimal amount of time.</p><h3>Replaceable battery</h3><p>While less common nowadays, replaceable battery flashlights have a lot of advantages. Most rely on a trio of triple-A batteries, located in the shaft of the flashlight itself. Though the batteries are more prone to draining quickly on a high charge, they are easier to replace while you are in transit since you can simply pack spares.</p><p>Most of these flashlights are waterproof and highly durable. Coming in a lot of different sizes, the majority of these flashlights are compact, ringing in at under six inches long. These flashlights are suited towards emergency preparation along with spare batteries since you can always swap out the power source.</p>"
trauma shears,"<h2>Types of trauma shear</h2><p>There are trauma shear options for every budget. The key is knowing which one will work best for you. Here's a breakdown of the options available, along with some tips on how to choose the right tool for your needs.</p><h3>Traditional trauma shear</h3><p>The traditional trauma shear is made from stainless steel and designed to cut through clothing or skin. It's sharp enough to do its job without damaging anything, but dull enough to prevent cutting yourself. These trauma shear options are inexpensive, durable, and easy to clean up if you get cut. They're great for emergency kits or camping gear because they can be cleaned up easily with soap and water.</p><p>Traditional trauma shear options are safe to use around food because they don't rust or break down like cheaper trauma shear options. However, they aren't as durable as more expensive trauma shear options. If you plan to use these trauma shear options in a high-use environment, it's worth spending a little extra money to get something that lasts longer.</p><h3>Multi-tool trauma shear</h3><p>These trauma shear options look like regular multi-tools, but they have blades instead of screwdrivers. They're sharp enough to cut through clothing or skin, but dull enough to prevent cutting yourself. These trauma shear options are affordable and easy to clean up if you get cut. They're great for emergency kits or camping gear because they can be cleaned up easily with soap and water.</p><p>These trauma shear options are safe to use around food because they don't rust or break down like cheaper trauma shear options.

under bed gun safes,"<h2>Types of under bed gun safes</h2><p>There are several different options for storing firearms in a home. The most common is an under-the-bed safe, which can be found at most big box stores or online retailers.</p><h3>Drawer Style</h3><p>A lockable drawer is sometimes used in place of a door on under-bed gun safes. It is pretty much a given that such safes have drawers that slide out from the long side. There may be a drawer-equipped under-bed safe that opens at the end rather than the side in the hidden recesses of the open market.</p><p>Drawers generally eat up usable storage space in under-bed gun safes, but not as much as tray-equipped door-style safes. Due to the decreased storage space, making a safe that fits underneath most bed frames is a bit more challenging.</p><h3>Door Style</h3><p>Some under-bed gun safes feature a lockable drawer in place of a door. For obvious reasons, virtually all such safes include a drawer that slides out from the long side of the safe. Sometimes, an under-bed safe will have its door located at one end of the body, but normally it will be on the long side. The sliding storage tray on door-equipped under-bed gun safes is a handy feature.</p><p>Probably the biggest drawback to drawer-style under-bed gun safes is that drawers necessarily eat into usable storage space although not as much as a tray-equipped door-style safe. However, they make it easier to access and organize the contents of your gun safe.</p>"
solar watches,"<h2>Types of solar watches</h2><p>Solar watches are a great way to stay on top of the sun's position without having to carry a dedicated watch. There are two main categories to choose from: analogue watches and digital watches. The third category is combination of the two, and they have their place, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Analogue Watches</h3><p>Analogue watches feature a traditional clock face with three-hand movement and are available for every budget. Where digital watches count down the seconds, showing only the exact time, analogue watches show you the time through hands-on a dial, usually in increments of five minutes. These hands may also show you the date or day of the week. The standout feature of analogue watches is that they are a representation of the classic and traditional side of timepieces. They are also perfect to wear on dressy occasions.</p><h3>Digital Watches</h3><p>Digital watches feature time in numerical digits and they are often packed with features like a GPS, pedometer and more. They do not contain any moving parts, and instead, rely on an electronic circuit to drive the LEDs or LCDs that show the time. The standout feature of digital watches is that they have an electronic display. The great thing about digital watches is that they are also available in many different price ranges. They are also perfect to wear for sporting activities and workwear.</p><h3>Hybrid Watches</h3><p>Hybrid watches feature analogue and digital combos. They offer similar functionality to smartwatches because they combine digital features with traditional watch mechanics. They are ideal for sports and fitness and offer a timepiece for every budget.</p>"
work watches,"<h2>Types of Work Watches</h2><h3>Quartz</h3><p>Most watches destined for life on construction sites will be powered by electricity and keep time by way of a precise quartz movement (i.e., the engine). Unlike the mechanical watches found in personal collections and museums, quartz watches for construction workers require little to no maintenance and can take incredible abuse without failing. While many generate power by battery, the best set'em and forget'em watches run off solar power, harnessing the light of the sun and even electrical lights to keep you moving without losing time.</p><h3>Smartwatch</h3><p>Everyone knows the age of the smartwatch has arrived, and for some, these timekeeping wonders are the only way to go. Most run off of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, while some take a queue from the quartz world and tap into that burning ball of fire overhead and the lesser lights of man to power their high-tech capabilities.</p>"
wall tents,"<h2>Types of Wall Tents</h2><p>Navigating the world of wall tents can be a daunting experience at the outset. Whether you're venturing into new territory or you're a seasoned hand, understanding what is available is critical to a smooth decision-making process.</p><p>Comparing wall tents for sale is like trying to buy a new phone.</p><p><h3>Cotton Canvas</h3>Canvas is a heavy, woven fabric that was traditionally made from cotton but is now also made from man-made fibers like polyester. The construction of canvas fabric takes into account the thread count per square inch and the tightness of the weave. This is important for determining the ability of the fabric to keep heat in and rain out.Canvas is also called Duck, from the Dutch word and has been used in the manufacture of sails, tarps, wall tents, backpacks and heavy clothing for centuries.<h3>Cotton Army Duck Canvas</h3>Army Duck fabric, also known as shelter duck, is a versatile, medium weight, multi-purpose duck canvas fabric with a tight, plied yarn weave construction, which makes it extremely sturdy and resistant to tearing. It is a double fill canvas, which means the threads are doubled by twisting two threads into a single thicker, stronger thread.In simple terms, army duck canvas is considerably more durable and reliable than regular cotton or polyester canvas. This makes it more ideal as a material of choice for tents that are intended for extended outdoor use.This is why we use army duck canvas for our tents at White Duck the fabric allows for a sturdier, more durable build while still reaping the benefits of regular cotton canvas, like breathability and a natural aversion to UV radiation.<h3>Polyester Canvas</h3>Polyester Canvas is a blend of natural cotton and man-made fabric. It combines the breathability of cotton with the durability of polyester, so it offers easier care and less wrinkling than cotton-only material. The upside of polyester canvas is that it is lightweight, durable, breathable, tear-resistant, and less susceptible to shrinkage, mold and mildew.</p>"
emergency radio,"<h2>Types of Emergency Radios</h2><p>Disaster agencies always recommend including a battery-operated radio in your emergency kit. Most radios are standard battery-operated models designed for entertainment but not necessarily as disaster management tools. If you already have one of these radios in your home, hang on to it and buy some extra batteries. It's always good to have backup equipment. But there are better options available. Below are descriptions of each type of disaster radio and how they work.</p><h3>Digital vs. Analog Tuning</h3><p>This is largely a matter of personal preference, although many people find that digital tuning makes it easier to find weather and shortwave stations. The flip side is that an analog tuner may be less likely to malfunction than a digital one.</p><h3>Weather Radios</h3><p>Weather radios offer access to NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards stations, which provide official information about weather conditions as well as advisories, watches, and warnings about weather and non-weather disasters and emergencies.</p><p>These radios may be powered by batteries, a rechargeable battery pack, or standard electricity. Some models offer more than one power option.</p><h3>Weather-Alert Radios</h3><p>A weather-alert radio operates like a smoke detector. When a weather or non-weather advisory, watch, or warning is reported, the radio signals you via sound, flashing lights, or both. You can then tune in to receive information. Some models can be connected to adaptive devices for people with a hearing impairment.</p><p>Because of their need for consistent power, many weather-alert radios must be plugged into an electrical power source, though many have a battery backup feature. This makes these radios less useful in situations where the power is out for a long time. On the plus side, keeping the radio plugged in means that it stays put and you won't have to hunt it down in an emergency.</p><p>If you do opt to purchase a model that requires constant power, consider purchasing an emergency radio that can be operated using a hand-crank as a back-up if the power goes down.</p><h3>Shortwave radio</h3><p>Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave (SW) radio frequencies. There is no official definition of the band, but the range always includes all of the high frequency band (HF), which extends from 3 to 30MHz (100 to 10metres); above the medium frequency band (MF), to the bottom of the VHF band.</p>"
tomahawks,"<h2>Types of Tomahawks</h2><p>With the head of a Tomahawk, you will be faced with a number of options. You can usually choose from; a single head, double head or a head with a spike/flat back. There are a few other types, but really these are the main ones.</p><h3>Tactical Tomahawk</h3><p>A tactical tomahawk is built for particular actions with a specific end. This is the tomahawk version that is used by the military as a multipurpose tool. These include breaking doors, smashing windows, breaking locks, opening crates and hand to hand combat.</p><h3>Throwing Tomahawk</h3><p>We have all see it in a movie. A mountain man or a native Indian takes a down a man by throwing a tomahawk in the air and sticking it in the enemy's back. All jokes aside there are many serious competitions all over the world where people compete to see who can precisely strike their tomahawk targets. These tomahawks are optimized to be thrown instead of for other purposes like smashing a window or deflating a tire.</p><h3>Combat Tomahawk</h3><p>A tomahawk designed for combat is not that different from a tactical or throwing tomahawk except that these tomahawks have been developed specifically for use in fighting and military operations. The main difference is that combat tomahawks are lighter because of the need to swing the tomahawk with relative ease and to make it easier to carry around all the time.</p>"
ar 15 scopes,"<h2>Types of AR-15 Scopes</h2><p>AR optics fall into four major categories: red dot, holographic, fixed-power, and variable power. Each one offers significant advantages and disadvantages that are endemic to the platform and should be considered when buying a new optic. Here's a breakdown of these optic types, how they work, and a summary of their advantages and disadvantages.</p><h3>Red dot</h3><p>Red dot optics are the simplest optics on this list. They produce the reticle by projecting a simple colored LED light onto a pane of glass. The light can be filtered through a shaped aperture, which can allow for red dots with things like crosshairs, ACSS reticles, and chevron reticles.</p><p>In general, the advantages of red dots are that they are extremely durable, can be made incredibly small, and have incredibly long battery lives, sometimes stretching well into tens of thousands of hours.</p><p>Disadvantages of red dots are that the light can appear streaked or starburst for those with astigmatism, total loss of capability if the battery does go out, and reticle scaling under magnification, meaning that if you magnify a red dot, the dot gets bigger, which can take up more of your field of view.</p><h3>Holographic</h3><p>Holographic sights work by projecting an image with lasers between two mirrors and two panes of glass, causing a reticle that floats in front of your weapon when viewed through the hologram window.</p><p>Holographic sights have the advantage of being mostly unaffected by astigmatism in the shooter's eye. They also have very crisp reticles that are unaffected by magnification, meaning it magnifies the image but not the reticle, so you can be more precise with your aim.</p><p>The disadvantage of holographic optics is that they project a holographic image with laser energy, and so they consume significantly more battery power than red dots, oftentimes with one-fiftieth battery life. Another disadvantage is that they're usually significantly larger, due to the more complex emitter.</p><h3>Fixed-power</h3><p>Fixed-power optics do not change magnification levels, and while technically you could argue that red dots and holographic sights are fixed power, fixed-power means lensatic optics with an etched reticle, which includes unmagnified optics like prismatic optics that can take the place of a red dot.</p><p>Fixed-power optics have several advantages, namely that due to their etched reticle, they do not require battery power to work, and their reticle image will be overall more precise. Additionally, they will often have an improved field-of-view and clarity over variable-power optics, with their lens geometry being precisely engineered for a single magnification level. They may feature illuminated reticles as an option, and many high-magnification precision optics are fixed-power.</p><p>Their primary disadvantage is their lack of flexibility at different ranges, meaning that optics with a high enough magnification level are effectively unusable at closer ranges, and vice versa.</p><h3>Variable-power</h3><p>Variable power optics are similar in construction to their fixed-power brethren in that they use lenses that feature etched reticles. The key difference is that they can toggle through magnification settings to address different ranges. They come in two major varieties: first focal plane, and second focal plane.</p><p>The first focal plane offers a scaling reticle that increases in size as you zoom in. It's useful for shooters who want reticles that reveal finer detail when zoomed in, which can be useful when shifting from low magnification where a coarse optic is needed, to high magnification when things like wind call grids and bullet drop compensators become more relevant.</p><p>The second focal plane has a reticle that does not change size even as magnification is changed. It's useful for shooters who want to maintain visual similarity of the reticle across all magnification levels, and who understand that they will have to do mental math to convert measurements depending on the magnification level.</p><p>One advantage of variable power optics is that they allow you to have a single optic that can be used at multiple distances without needing offset red dots, re-zeroing, or backup iron sights. Another advantage is that they can allow you more magnification than you typically need at a certain distance. This allows for improved visibility to ensure, for instance, you're indeed about to shoot a coyote hiding in the brush and not a young fawn.</p><p>The disadvantage of variable power optics is that they're oftentimes more expensive, heavier, and larger than equivalent fixed-power optics. Also, lower-end options can experience visual distortion at different magnification levels.</p>"
thermos,"<h2>Types of Thermoses</h2><h3>Multipurpose</h3><p>The highest utility selections feature the ability to support both hot and cold contents. This type of thermos features substantial insulation inside of the shell. The vacuum technology can keep contents at the proper temperature for up to 24 hours. True multipurpose thermoses are able to hold both drinks and soup. While these thermoses are powerful, they tend to be bulkier and much heavier than their more basic counterparts.</p><h3>Hot Content</h3><p>The phrase thermos was adopted in reference to the Greek word for heat. Though originally the vacuum packaging was used for military-focused purposes, it became popular among civilians as a coffee thermos. These containers are slimmer than their multipurpose counterparts and are usually designed to fit beneath a coffee maker. A downside of this type is that they usually must be hand washed to prevent heat damage to the insulation.</p><h3>Cold Conten</h3><p>Often used for exercise in hot climates, cold content thermoses are options that keep fluids cold longer than they retain heat. These are popular amongst runners or those undergoing outdoor training. It prevents the sun from heating up the fluid, making it easier to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. Most come with a carabiner to make it easier to hold the thermos while on the most. They are also fairly lightweight, adding ease to transportation.</p>"
camping hammocks,"<h2>Types of Camping Hammocks</h2><p>Camping hammocks come in all different sizes and shapes, so it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Parachute hammock</h3><p>A parachute hammock is a popular hammock type made from ripstop nylon. These hammocks are ultralight and portable, making them a great option for backpacking or camping.</p><h3>Flat Lay hammock</h3><p>This type of hammock has a flat bottom, allowing you to lie down flat on your back or stomach. This makes them more comfortable for sleeping in than other hammock types. Flat Lay hammocks like the Haven hammock combine the best of sleeping suspended in the air and sleeping in a tent.</p><h3>Ridgeline hammock</h3><p>A ridgeline hammock is similar to a flat lay hammock but has a ridgeline running along the top of the hammock. This helps to keep the fabric taut, making it more comfortable to lie in.</p><h3>Two person hammock</h3><p>Two person hammocks are great for couples or friends who want to camp together. They are larger than single person hammocks and can accommodate two people comfortably. They are also called double hammocks, unlike single hammocks that are designed for one person.</p><h3>Three person hammock</h3><p>Three person hammocks are designed to accommodate three people. They are larger than two person hammocks and can be used by families or groups of friends who want to camp together.</p><h3>Hammock Tent</h3><p>A hammock tent is a type of hammock that has a built-in mosquito net and rain fly. This makes them ideal for camping in areas where there are insects or inclement weather.</p><h3>Lounging hammocks</h3><p>These are your basic parachute hammocks - typically the most affordable options on the market.</p><p>These options are great for setting up in your backyard or the local park, and they're light enough to throw in your pack for backpacking. Although they often don't come with many features, you can purchase an additional bug net, rain tarp, and under- and over-quilts to use these hammocks all four seasons.</p><h3>Ultralight hammocks</h3><p>These hammocks weigh less than an apple and are easy to pack away. Ultralight hammocks are great for backpackers looking to cut down on weight. Ultralight hammocks are also great for car campers who want to cut down on weight. You can get options that weigh as little as five ounces, which is about the same weight as a bottle of water. These hammocks are also good for tent campers because they don't add much weight to their packs.Ultralight hammocks are easy to pack away and are lightweight enough to fit inside a pack. They're also easy to unpack and set up.</p><p>The downside is that ultralight hammocks aren't very durable. They tend to break easily when hit or dropped. Ultralight hammocks are also bulky and difficult to pack away. They don't fold up like other options, so they take up valuable space in your pack.</p>"
climbing packs,"<h2>Types of Climbing Packs</h2><p>There are several different kinds of climbing packs on the market. The first thing you need to know is what kind you want. There's a pack for every type of climbing trip, so it's important to pick one that fits your needs.</p><h3>Rock climbing</h3><p>Most rock climbing backpacks are designed for one-day multi-pitch climbing and have volume capacities ranging from 14 to 20 liters. They are intended to carry essential equipment like an extra rope, rack of climbing protection, harness, approach shoes, a headlamp, water, food, rain and warming layers, and a communication device. Generally, they are carried by the person belaying the leader to allow the leader to focus on leading the pitch.</p><p>It's important to get a rock climbing bag that's large enough to stow all of your gear inside of it. Crap dangling off the side tends to come unattached and go dangerously hurtling down the rock face. Climbing packs ride higher off the hips to avoid getting in the way of your climbing harness and most have removable hip belts and emergency whistles built into the sternum straps. Look for packs that are made from more durable materials, as they will be frequently abrading against rock and bombroof haul loops. Crag bags and small haul bags also fit into this category.</p><h3>Alpine mountaineering packs</h3><p>Alpine packs are designed to support adventures over mixed terrain like rock, ice, and snow. They all sport top-loading designs and lean towards much lighter high-tensile fabrics than rock climbing packs to save on overall weight. Alpine packs are also designed to externally carry ice axes via loop or toggle retention systems, crampons in special external pockets or with straps, and most have the ability to carry skis or snowboards. Most will have design considerations for quick access to avalanche safety kits consisting of a shovel, avalanche probe, and snow saw. They'll also have design features for externally carrying ice pickets and ropes. For one to three day mountaineering adventures, look for packs in the 35- to 50-liter range.</p><h3>Mountaineering expedition packs</h3><p>These packs generally sport all the features of alpine mountaineering packs but have much greater internal capacity (ranging from 55 to 110 liters) to accommodate for additional high altitude and cold-weather equipment. Due to the heavier loads, they are designed with more robust and more comfortable suspension systems designed to transfer the weight of the pack to your hips. The back panels are generally designed to provide more ventilation than alpine packs. They'll also have more external attachment points, internal access points, and internal organization pockets.</p><h3>Crag Pack</h3><p>The basic climbing pack, sometimes called a crag pack, is designed specifically to carry climbing gear to the crag: quickdraws, rope, climbing shoes, snacks, water, layers for variable weather conditions. This bulky gear needs to be carried up potentially steep and scrabbly terrain and then be easily accessible at the destined crag. The pack will likely get scraped against rocks and trees on the way.</p><p>Durability and suspension might be sacrificed for a lighter pack in alpine or mountaineering situations, but for a crag pack you want something that can take daily cragging abuse. Crag packs frequently have multiple handles to easily move them from route to route on the same crag or wall. Most crag packs will be about 35 liters to 50 liters and they tend to come in many different opening or loading styles detailed in a section below. These different loading styles provide easy access to all of the gear.</p><h3>Rope Bags</h3><p>Rope bags are tarps turned into packs to carry your most precious lifeline and keep it clean. Over time dirt gets inside the rope fibers, getting the belayer's hands dirty and creating more wear and grime on all of the hardware the rope passes through, but a rope tarp or bag can help minimize this.</p><p>Rope bags can also make it easier to keep the rope organized and avoid knots forming without having to carefully coil it after each use. If a crag pack is big enough, the rope and rope bag can be carried inside of it. Some climbers who pack light will use a rope bag instead of a crag pack to carry everything. A rope bag can also be used to keep your climbing shoes off the dirt when not being used for climbing.</p><h3>Alpine or Mountaineering Packs</h3><p>Alpine packs are designed for more variety of terrain including rock, snow, and ice. They usually have bungee cords or loops on the outside to attach ice climbing tools and crampons without cutting the pack (or the climber wearing the pack). Alpine packs tend to be top loading and of lighter fabrics to shave weight and keep things as simple and streamlined as possible while still carrying everything. They also tend to have simpler closing systems that can be used while wearing gloves. For adventures that are one day or less a good size is 35 to 50 liters.</p><h3>Overnight or Extended Alpine and Mountaineering</h3><p>For being out in the wilderness then something at least 45 liters or bigger make great options. These are built for packing the kitchen sink and hauling it up long approaches.</p><h3>Haul Bags</h3><p>The well-named haul bag is meant to be pulled up a wall behind you on longer climbs after. Since they are pulled up by the rope across a rock face, they are engineered to be streamlined and extremely durable. The two most widely used fabrics are urethane and vinyl coated nylon. Most haul bags are shaped like big buckets with straps on top.</p><p>This is a good choice if you want a crag pack that is burly enough to handle a zombie apocalypse, nuclear holocaust, alien invasion, a severe shortage of taco trucks, or if you just want to carry your lunch through packs of starving mountain bikers.</p><h3>Summit Packs</h3><p>Summit packs are designed to be small enough to be worn while climbing without hindering movement. This is the smallest category of climbing packs, 10 to 20 liters. Since most of the actual climbing protection including quickdraws, slings, cams, and nuts will be on the climber's harness loops, the summit pack is for carrying water, snacks, and an extra layer or two of storm protection. Summit packs might be stored inside of a bigger pack during the approach to the base of a cli</p>"
folding tables,"<h2>Types of Folding Tables</h2><h3>Round and oval-shaped tables</h3><p>Round tables are the most common choice for parties, dining or social gatherings such as weddings where everyone wants to mingle. As people are seated in a circle, it makes conversation far easier. Businesses also often prefer circle meeting room tables if the space allows.</p><p>Usually, you'll be able to find one style available in many different diameters to accommodate your requirements. However, bear in mind that larger tables will need more space to unfold and will be heavier to handle.</p><h3>Rectangle and square-shaped tables</h3><p>Rectangle and square tables with flat straight edges allow for more configuration options when using multiple tables. With flat sides, you can quickly adapt the space to suit your needs and maximise the area with more surfaces. Highly versatile, rectangular and square folding tables can be used in nearly any environment, from conferences to meetings, dining, offices and more. Rectangle and square ranges will often be available in varying widths and lengths, allowing you to combine sizes for greater flexibility.</p><h3>Double-D and D-End shaped tables</h3><p>This is a combination of a round and rectangle shape. A table with straight sides and rounded ends offers several advantages to the user. With rounded ends, not only are you saving on space, making it easier for people to move around them, but you're also making it safer by avoiding injuries caused by walking into table corners. These tables are ideal for schools, nurseries, care homes and hospitality.</p><h3>Other tabletop shapes</h3><p>Depending on the manufacturer or supplier, some ranges offer different shapes to allow for more creativity with layouts. You may see shapes, like a 72&ordm; segment tabletop, putting these together can create a wave-like effect. You can use a Quadrant corner if you want to connect rectangle or square tables with additional rounded surfaces. When choosing a collapsible table range, there are more options than round and rectangle, so make sure you look at all the options available.</p>"
ballistic glasses,"<h2>Types of Ballistic Glasses</h2><p>Ballistic glasses eye protection, and ""safety glasses"" get tossed around interchangeably and there are some important reasons not to mix them up. A woodshop and an open-faced motorcycle helmet do not present the same hazards. What you deal with on a shooting range and what you face in combat are two very different things. There's great eye pro for all those scenarios, but it isn't one-size-fits-all kind of gear.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for shooting</h3><p>Eye protection for shooters can be divided into two categories: those built to civilian standards and those built to military standards.</p><p>The civilian ANSO Z87.1-2020 standard requires ballistic glasses to protect your eyes from projectiles in a wide variety of settings. This includes hunting and recreational shooting, but the threats you'll encounter in those activities are nothing compared to the dangers of a hot battlefield. The military's MIL-PRF-31013 standard subjects ballistic glasses to much harsher testing, and that's the standard we used for this gear guide.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for work</h3><p>If you need eye protection for work on a construction site, machine shop, lumber yard, or other dynamic environments, the ANSI standard is more than sufficient. You can open up your options and save a bundle by shopping in this category of eye protection, too.</p><p>These glasses can also serve you perfectly well in recreational shooting sports. You don't need the very toughest eye protection to poke holes in paper or knock down game animals, so you should be in good hands with a pair of ANSI-approved shooting glasses.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for motorcycling</h3><p>We'd love to believe that every service member is a stone-cold gunslinger, but the reality is that most people shoot once a year to qualify if they even do that. It's entirely possible that there are more motorcyclists than serious shooters in the U.S. Military.</p><p>The military requires service members to wear a DOT-approved helmet, but you don't have to wear a full-face helmet. Open-face alternatives are popular, but they aren't the safest type of motorcycle helmet. Aside from leaving your money-maker exposed to asphalt and truck bumpers, they do nothing to protect your eyes. You can upgrade your riding safety with a solid pair of ballistic glasses. Your options range from impact-resistant sunglasses to padded goggles. All of them are better than your reflexes.</p>"
mag pouches for plate carriers,"<h2>Types of Mag Pouches for Plate Carriers</h2><p>When we're looking at mag pouches specifically for attaching to a plate carrier, there isn't a lot of variety.</p><h3>Basic</h3><p>Basic mag pouches are one, two, or three magazines in a single row that rides close to the plate carrier. These are the basic design of mag pouches and prevent unwanted bulk. Many of these feature MOLLE webbing on the front for you to customize the kit with. Where basic mag pouches excel is that they keep mags close to your body and help spread out the load.</p><h3>Stackers</h3><p>These are bulkier than basic mag pouches because they feature a second row of mag pouches in the front. Two-by-one, two-by-two, or two-by-three, these increase the number of magazines you can carry in a consolidated form. The mags can be staggered at different heights, or ride at the same height with different levels of fabric on the pouches. These are ideal for anyone needing to carry a large number of magazines.</p><h3>Kangaroo</h3><p>Named after the marsupial that carries its young in a stomach pouch, kangaroo mag pouches have additional pouches integral to the front. These are commonly pistol mag pouches so that warfighters with secondaries don't have to find more accessories. However, the kangaroo feature could also be an admin, radio, or grenade pouch. These are versatile-styled pouches for anyone with wide mission scopes.</p>"
karambit knives,"<h2>Types of Karambits</h2><p>Karambits come in many different forms and sizes. No matter what task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, it's probable that you'll be able to find a blade that suits your needs. Whether you're a Kali practitioner or in need of an EDC/utility knife, there are options for you at pretty much every price point.</p><p>Modern karambits come in both fixed blade and folding blade varieties. Some karambits are production karambits, which typically means they're mass-produced by large companies, and others are custom karambits and available on a limited basis. Many custom karambits are designed by a blade smith and are handmade with love, but not all. Some custom karambits are cut by machine and then finished by hand while others are simply designed for a specific client or purpose. Functional karambits are """"live"""" blades, meaning they're sharp.</p><h3>Fixed-blade</h3><p>A fixed blade is any knife with a blade that is fixed in place, meaning that it doesn't have a pivot and is firmly, immovably attached to the handle. They're essentially the opposite of pocket knives. The blade is always exposed unless it's sheathed. They're simple, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly due to the absence of a confusing locking mechanism. Fixed-blades can be double- or single-edged.</p><h3>Folder</h3><p>Also referred to as a pocket knife, a folder is a compact knife that features one or more blades that fold up into the handle in lieu of using a bulky sheath. Meant to fit easily inside your pocket, these knives are legal to carry in most places, and are convenient to carry and use daily. They are frequently smaller than fixed blades, with blades typically between three and four inches long, although there are many exceptions that are both longer and shorter than this.</p><p>Folding karambits are also limited to being single-edged, due to the spine of the blade always being exposed. However, they're quite handy they can do everything from peeling an apple to cutting rope or canvas to opening packages. Though these folding knives are typically smaller and not as strong as their fixed blade siblings, they're highly versatile.</p><h3>Trainer</h3><p>These are commonly used for practice and training as a notably safer substitute for live blades, i.e., knives that are sharp. Typically, trainers are made of rubber or plastic, though unsharpened, blunted metal training blades do exist.</p><p>Practice or ""training"" karambits have no sharpened edges and are designed for accident-free martial arts, tactical, self defense, combative and field instruction and learning.</p><h3>Karambit Mariposa</h3><p>It opens at the top, but there is a slight downside. Since the blade is still curved, making it a traditional karambit knife, you have to face curvature as an obstacle when trying to open it.</p>"
duffel bags,"<h2>Types of Duffel Bags</h2><p>Most products have some combination of handles and straps that you can carry in your hand, slung over your shoulder, or on your back in like a backpack. Each of these applications has its place, and may be the most comfortable and convenient carry method depending on the weight of the pack and the distance and duration of carrying.</p><h3>Traditional Duffel Handles</h3><p>Most duffel bags include a set of traditional carrying handles for a briefcase-style carry by your side. These handles are usually permanently attached to the bag and typically have a velcro clasp to join the two handles together and provide a more comfortable grip. They are generally reasonably lightweight, are convenient to grab, and stay out of the way when not in use, but can make for uncomfortable and awkward hauling with larger bags and or heavier loads.</p><h3>Shoulder Straps</h3><p>The second traditional carrying method is a long shoulder strap. This single strap attaches to both ends of the bag, is usually adjustable in length, and often has some sort of padding for your shoulder. It is also typically removable to keep it out of the way during the airline baggage check process or when you simply don't want to use it.</p><p>Although this carrying method is typically not as comfortable or balanced as dual backpack straps over longer distances, it is very efficient for hauling heavier loads across shorter distances, or when you may repeatedly be setting it down and picking it back up.</p><h3>Backpack Straps</h3><p>Dual backpack straps are typically the most useful and comfortable carrying option for larger and heavier loads over most distances. Being able to balance the load evenly across your back is much easier than carrying a bag on one side of your body, and leaves your hands free to hail a taxi, grab other luggage, or wrangle stray kiddos. Most of the options in our review lineup include some kind of backpack straps with varying degrees of padding and ergonomic design.</p><p>Straps with thicker padding, contoured shapes, and adjustability on both ends tend to perform the best. Also, keep in mind how easy it is to remove or stow away the shoulder straps. Many airlines request that you remove all loose straps during the baggage check process. Removing some straps is a tedious process involving weaving thick pieces of webbing through small buckle slots, while others have quick-release buckles or clips or even their own built-in stowaway compartment.</p>"
down jackets,"<h2>Types of Down Jackets</h2><p>Down jackets are designed for specific activities. For example, a base layer jacket is ideal for skiing or snowmobiling because it keeps you warm without adding weight to your pack. A mid-layer jacket is ideal for hunting because it's lightweight and breathable enough to stay dry in cold weather. An outer shell jacket is ideal for hiking because it protects against the elements.</p><h3>Lightweight Down Jackets</h3><p>A healthy percentage of down jackets fall into the lightweight category. In general, we think of designs that have approximately 3 to 4 ounces of down fill as being lightweight, which means that they are great for shoulder seasons, warmer winter days, or as a midlayer for skiing.</p><p>Depending on what you wear underneath and your level of activity, a lightweight down jacket can provide sufficient warmth to just around freezing. For anything colder than that, you'll want to look in the midweight or heavyweight categories.</p><h3>Midweight Down Jackets</h3><p>Models pack in 5.4 ounces of 700-fill down nicely balances an ultralight construction with a healthy 5.6 ounces of higher-quality 800-fill down. In practice, these jackets offer a noticeable boost in warmth compared to their lightweight counterparts above. You can midweight jackets with just a t-shirt on into the teens Fahrenheit and stayed warm and cozy throughout.</p><h3>Heavyweight Down Jackets</h3><p>For true winter conditions, a heavyweight down jacket is your best bet. These burly designs have the highest amount of down fill on the market and often feature weather-resistant shell fabrics, large hoods, and longer cuts for protection below the waist.</p><p>In addition, some heavy-duty winter jackets see a drop in down quality (more on this in fill power below) as they tend to take on a more casual slant.</p>"
compression socks,"<h2>Types of Compression Socks</h2><p>Let's begin by listing some of the compression garments that you've probably seen advertised. Next to each, you'll see a brief description of how they're normally used.</p><h3>Compression Stockings</h3><p>Compression socks and stockings function the same way although they're made out of different material. Both socks and stockings can be made to the same medical specifications.</p><h3>Uniform Compression Socks</h3><p>These socks apply a uniform pressure level throughout the entire length of the sock. They're often sold for athletic compression.</p><h3>TED Hose</h3><p>Also known as anti-embolism stockings, TED hose prevent embolism in bedridden patients. These stockings normally provide uniform compression measuring less than 20 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).</p><h3>Graduated Compression Socks and Stockings</h3><p>Most scientific studies about compression socks and stockings focus on graduated compression, and doctors usually prescribe this type of garment to treat medical conditions. This form of compression provides greater pressure on the foot and ankle as a way to assist venous return. Graduated compression socks are only available in longer lengths (knee-high, thigh-high, waist-high, etc.), and they're labeled with a numeric pressure range in mmHg.</p><h3>Compression Sleeves</h3><p>Like compression socks and stockings, compression sleeves offer either uniform or graduated compression. They're usually made of neoprene, and they don't cover the foot and ankle. Most commonly, athletes use these garments for recovery.</p><h3>Pneumatic Compression Devices</h3><p>These forms of compression therapy involve the use of air pumps to manually compress the legs or arms. These are frequently utilized in a hospital setting to prevent deep vein blood clots, also known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). They can also be purchased from medical supply stores and online retailers.</p><h3>Other Compression Gear</h3><p>Athletes wear compression tights, shorts, shirts, and unitards under regular athletic gear to improve stability and optimize recovery. While there's evidence that compression shorts and tights work to improve recovery and blood circulation, there's less research to support the use of compression shirts and unitards for this purpose.</p>"
chest rigs,"<h2>Types of chest rigs</h2><p>In order for you to choose the best chest rig, we need to identify them by their intended purpose. We've broken chest rigs down into different categories based on the design and how you'll be wearing them.</p><h3>Light/Minimalist Chest Rig</h3><p>Minimalist chest rigs are typically designed to meet a specific goal, and so are not as configurable to different scenarios. In exchange, they are simple, and in some cases, disposable.</p><p>A well-worn and adapted chest rig of this type is suited for providing neighborhood security during times of civil unrest, as it can easily go unnoticed.</p><h3>Mid-weight/Recce Chest Rigs</h3><p>These approach two very separate, but related scenarios: military ranging, and stalking elusive game. In both situations, there is a time to move quickly over adverse terrain, and another to move with precision, while still carrying an array of mission-specific tools. Where the hunter may drop his pack and set up camp, those ranging deep behind enemy lines will set up a patrol base when approaching a specific target.</p><p>The mid-weight chest rig will carry the mission essential gear, from demolitions, to binoculars. It can be thought of as a chest rig meant to carry tools in addition to the baseline of ammunition, medical, and signalling.</p><h3>Heavy/Expedition Level Chest Rigs</h3><p>The end-all-bring-all of Chest Rigs, water, food, and other sustainment resources can be carried on these larger, more expansive load-bearing rigs. Most likely to be modular, these can be thrown over a plate carrier if need be, but it distinguishes itself from the mid-weight category via application. Where a mid-weight might be used for a 3-10 day operation, an expedition class rig is for those expecting multiple consecutive weeks away from a base, who can be resupplied in the field.</p>"
hiking pants,"<h2>Types of Hiking Pants</h2><p>Choosing the ideal style of hiking pants for you will ultimately come down to where and when you plan on doing your hiking.</p><p>Without venturing into the world of variants like the best rain pants and best running leggings, there are, broadly speaking, three main types of hiking pants. These are convertible pants, standard pants, and softshell pants.</p><h3>Standard Hiking Pants</h3><p>Standard hiking pants are straight-leg models that look like regular city-wear but incorporate a few hiking-specific add-ons and design characteristics to optimize performance and convenience on the trail, such as stretchy fabric, DWR coatings, roll-up legs, drawcord ankle closures, zippered pockets, articulated knees, and a gusseted crotch.</p><p>While more durable and breathable than streetwear pants, one of the main appeals of this style of pants is that they look as much home on the trails as they do in town. They are best for general hiking.</p><h3>Softshell hiking pants</h3><p>Softshell hiking pants are performance-orientated pants that are designed to hold up better to the rough treatment they're likely to be exposed to when hiking in more technical terrain, in three-season conditions, or when mountaineering. Softshells are made with high-performance fabrics that offer more resistance to abrasion, tears, water, and wind than standard hiking pants. They are best for three-season hiking and mountaineering.</p><h3>Convertible Pants</h3><p>Convertible pants (aka zip-off hiking pants), as the name suggests, are hiking pants that can be converted into shorts whenever temps on the trail get a little too balmy for full-leg coverage. These are great for hiking in variable conditions or on hikes with a significant altitude difference between the trailhead and the top, allowing you to alternate between pant and short mode in a matter of seconds as and when conditions require. These are also useful if you're hiking in warm conditions and want to wear shorts but also want to have a backup plan in case the bugs are out, temps drop later in the day, or if you come across a section of trail that will tear your legs up without lower-leg protection. The only downside to these pants is that the added zipper can add a little weight, but this is a small price to pay for the convenience and versatility they offer in return. They are best for hiking in variable conditions and backpacking</p>"
plate carriers,"<h2>Types of plate carriers</h2><p>While plate carriers have similar features, they vary in construction materials and intended purpose. While they all come in a range of styles, they can be categorized into four types: low-profile, training, maritime, and general-purpose.</p><h3>Low-profile</h3><p>A low-profile plate carrier refers to either a concealable plate carrier that fits under a shirt or jacket, or a carrier that fits over your shirt and holds gear but takes up very little space and doesn't weigh a whole lot. They generally feature slick plate bags, minimal cummerbunds, and little to no MOLLE webbing.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>A training plate carrier, usually designed for civilian use, fits somewhere between a low-profile carrier and a general-purpose carrier. What that means is it has more features than a low-profile but not as much as a general purpose. Instead of significant MOLLE webbing, it will feature things like placards, Velcro attachments, padded plate bags, and built-in admin pouches.</p><h3>Maritime</h3><p>Maritime plate carriers are meant for use close to water, such as with Marines, sailors, and Coast Guardsmen. They're designed so if you fall into a body of water, you can surface and avoid drowning. In general, they feature some sort of quick-release mechanism, and modern examples use thermoplastic or laminate materials, which won't absorb water.</p><h3>General-purpose</h3><p>General-purpose carriers are the category that most body armor vests worn by military personnel fall under. Designed for direct combat, these vests prioritize load-bearing, protection, and MOLLE space to make sure that the individual combatant has everything they need and can carry it on long missions.</p>"
glock 19 holsters,"<h2>Types of Glock 19 holsters</h2><h3>Outside the waistband</h3><p>An outside-the-waistband holster, or an OWB holster, is typically worn for open carry - like the way cops or security guards do - but it's not an uncommon mode for concealed carry. The biggest benefit of OWB carry is comfort because you don't have a bulky hunk of metal and polymer rubbing against your body. The downside is that everyone can see your gun unless it's hidden behind a cover garment.</p><p>If you do wear an OWB holster, you'll want to clip it by your hip on your strong side. There are cross-draw holsters, but they're meant for specific circumstances. Also, when concealing an OWB holster, it is important to consider your cover garment. Heavier layers like jackets or coats are usually the standard, but if you are carrying a smaller gun, you can get away with a light button-up shirt.</p><h3>Inside the waistband</h3><p>An inside-the-waistband holster, or an IWB holster, is only worn for concealed carry. The benefit is that it makes concealing a handgun fairly easy because it's wedged between your pants and your body, but for that same reason, it's not as comfortable as OWB carry.</p><p>When you wear an IWB holster, you put it wherever you find it most comfortable. However, the most common areas are strong side at the four- or five-o -clock position, or in the front over your appendix (called appendix carry). Small-of-the-back carry is also a thing, but it's largely discouraged because if you fall and land on the gun, you could suffer a severe back injury.</p><h3>Shoulder holsters</h3><p>Shoulder holsters come in a variety of styles, the most common being where the gun/holster is under the armpit suspended by shoulder straps looped around both arms. You can find a shoulder holster that positions your gun either parallel or perpendicular to the ground. The latter is best for larger handguns with longer barrels.</p><p>When you wear a shoulder holster, you'll need to keep a few things in mind. First, you'l need to wear a cover garment like a jacket or loose-fitting shirt to conceal your firearm. Next, you'll also need to be able to access your firearm through the front of your garment. And, lastly, you'll need to consider your surroundings before you draw your handgun. If you draw from a shoulder holster parallel to the ground, you'll flag any person behind you.</p><p>Since the Glock 19 is larger compared to some options specifically marketed for concealed carry, a shoulder holster can help tremendously with carrying comfortably so long as proper cover garments are worn.</p><h3>Appendix IWBs</h3><p>Appendix IWBs are ideal for carrying and concealing larger handguns you can't fit in a standard holster. You'll carry your pistol in the front - your lower stomach/groin area.</p><p>They have become more popular in the recent years, but should only be used by advanced shooters. Since Glock 19 is not a large gun, but some of the kydex holsters on our list can be worn in the appendix position.</p>"
thermal scopes,"<h2>Types of thermal scopes</h2><p>On the surface, there are basically thermal optics that are designed for handheld use and thermal scopes that can be mounted to a firearm. Both styles have their place and both include entry-level options all the way up to top-shelf products. Your first step is to determine how you plan to use your fancy new thermal scope. Then, you can get into the technical features.</p><h3>Handheld thermal scopes</h3><p>The simplest way to get a thermal view of the world is with a handheld monocular that isn't designed as a rifle scope. These devices use the same technology to create a heat-based image, but don't need to incorporate a reticle or mounting system.</p><p>The biggest advantage of owning this kind of thermal optic is the ability to use it without pointing a weapon. That can be key during a search for a missing person, an attempt to identify a subject who has recently fled the scene of a crime, or when you need to track down game animals in the brush. With proper training, it can potentially be used to identify weapons and body armor under clothing. You may be able to determine whether an approaching person is male or female, and even visualize physical exertion in the form of increased body temperature.</p><h3>Standard thermal scopes</h3><p>Thermal imaging presents a massive tactical advantage when mounted to a firearm. Scopes like offer impressive capabilities in hunting and tactical environments. Because these systems are digital, you can change your reticle and color scheme on the fly. Some even have a one-shot-zero feature and can save profiles for multiple weapons or ammunition. The amount of customization in a quality thermal scope is astounding.</p><p>Unlike night vision, thermal imaging requires no light to function, resulting in a distinct advantage in dense vegetation, under cloud cover, and during moonless nights. One important thing to remember is that the real world is not a shooting range - target identification may be the biggest challenge you face. Thermal scopes have three effective ranges: detection, recognition, and identification. While you may be able to see a person or animal nearly 2,000 yards away, being able to tell the difference between a hog and a calf or spot a weapon is another story entirely.</p><h3>Clip-on thermal sights</h3><p>If you aren't ready to dedicate a rifle to thermal use, a clip-on sight can be a great solution. These optics aren't much cheaper than a thermal scope, but they can be combined with your existing scope when you need thermal capabilities and removed when you don't.</p><p>The downside of adding a clip-on thermal sight to your rifle is added complexity. You'll have two optics to control instead of one, and reaching your thermal sight might be a stretch. It will also be heavier than using a dedicated thermal scope. Either approach is viable and both have devoted followers.</p><h3>Vehicle-mounted</h3><p>We'll go out on a limb and guess that you're not shopping for the kind of thermal optics they mount on attack helicopter. Still, they exist and - we imagine- have capabilities far beyond what's made public.</p>"
solar generators,"<h2>Types of Solar Panels</h2><p>A solar generator uses solar panels to collect the energy from the sunlight. There are various types of solar panels found in the market yet the most commonly used panels are monocrystalline panels, polycrystalline solar cells, and amorphous crystal panels.</p><p>Let's know about them in detail.</p><h3>Monocrystalline Panels</h3><p>The most commonly used solar panels for personal solar power systems. Since they are made up of single-crystal silicone wafers, they are a bit expensive than polycrystalline counterparts and other types.</p><h3>Polycrystalline Solar Cells</h3><p>This type of solar panels is made of melted silicone fragments. Since the electrons move less freely in fragments, these panels are a bit less efficient. In some cases, the difference between monocrystalline and polycrystalline is less relevant.</p><h3>Amorphous Crystal Panels</h3><p>These are the most efficient solar technology and found in smaller solar panels. They are made of a thin film of silicon and has most versions of solar panels. They are durable, slim, light, flexible and cheap. These solar cells have a shorter lifespan and less effective than monocrystalline panels. They take two times more footprint to generate the same power.</p>"
hiking socks,"<h2>Types of Hiking Socks</h2><h3>Crew Socks</h3><p>The most common type of socks. They are thick, mid- calf length and are usually ribbed at the top.</p><h3>Liner Socks</h3><p>Thin socks which can be worn under a thicker pair of socks. The main function of a liner sock is to prevent blisters by wicking away moisture that causes friction and to pad out boots so they don't move up and down. Liner socks can also be worn on their own in warmer conditions or for shorter walks.</p><h3>Double Layer Walking Socks</h3><p>These are very thick socks which have a built in lining sock. These will help to prevent blisters and add comfort.</p><h3>Trainer Socks</h3><p>These can be worn with walking shoes for short walks in warmer conditions but aren&rsquo;t suitable for long hikes in tricky terrains.</p>"
flashlights,"<h2>Types of flashlights</h2><h3>Incandescent Bulb Flashlights</h3><p>Incandescent bulb flashlights are the most common type found in people's homes. They have been around for many decades and usually run on D batteries.</p><p>Generally speaking, these flashlights are most convenient for their affordability.</p><p>Incandescent bulb flashlights are made to be weather resistant and will resist corrosion as well. You will be able to make use of this flashlight in rainy situations because it is water resistant, and it is durable enough to withstand being dropped. It should work well for many purposes.</p><h3>LED Flashlights</h3><p>There are situations where having an LED flashlight is going to be preferable. They don't work in the same way as incandescent bulb flashlights they don't produce any heat and can last for a long time.</p><p>The cost of an LED flashlight should be similar to the cost of a heavy duty incandescent bulb flashlight.</p><p>LED flashlights give off a different type of light: Incandescent bulbs beam a white light with a yellow hue; LED lights give off white light with a blue hue.</p><h3>High-Intensity Discharge HID Flashlights</h3><p>High-intensity discharge flashlights are usually abbreviated to HID flashlights. These types of flashlights will be capable of producing an extremely bright light. They work by having an electrical current run through a ball of ionized gas, so they're definitely different from either of the models that have been mentioned so far.</p><p>These flashlights are far less common than either incandescent models or LED models. The HID flashlights are more expensive due to how they work. In order to purchase one of these flashlights, you may have to pay up to 10 times the price of one of the incandescent flashlights.</p><h3>Pressurized Gas Flashlights</h3><p>Some incandescent bulbs also include pressurized gases to increase the life of the bulb. Gases such as xenon, halogen, and krypton can help to brighten light while burning out more slowly.</p><p>The flashlight, shown here, comes equipped with a krypton bulb. This will allow the flashlight to generally be brighter while lasting longer. Despite its utility, this flashlight is also very inexpensive, making it a good option for anyone who is on a budget.</p><p>This flashlight is powered by standard D batteries, not unlike the vast majority of incandescent bulb flashlights, and are a good choice to have in emergency situations.</p><h3>Solar-Powered Flashlights</h3><p>Most solar-powered flashlights are going to be significantly weaker than the other options on this list. There are some models out there that can get fairly bright, but you shouldn't expect it to be able to compete with an LED flashlight or an HID flashlight. These are cost-effective flashlights that will be comparable to an incandescent bulb flashlight when they are properly charged.</p><p>The model that is being shown here also comes with a hand crank. This allows you to generate some power on your own in order to produce light. This is convenient for when you haven't charged the flashlight with solar energy and still need to make use of it.</p><h3>Headlamp Flashlights</h3><p>Headlamp flashlights are very convenient to own because they can help you to light your way while your hands are otherwise occupied. If you need a flashlight to see, but you also need to carry something, it can get a little inconvenient. The solution to this problem is to own one of these headlamps. They can strap right on your head and they will easily light your way.</p><p>This is a great flashlight to own when you want to make things as convenient on yourself as possible. Wearing the flashlight on your head allows you to do other things with your hands. If your car breaks down on the road at night, having one of these available to use will be a godsend. You'll be able to work on your car and you'll actually be able to see.</p><h3>Lanterns</h3><p>Lanterns are another convenient way to light up the area that you will want to consider. Of course, traditional lanterns use kerosene or another type of fuel to provide a flame. In modern times, LED lanterns have become much more common. They work similarly to LED flashlights, except you just need to set them down near your location, rather than pointing them where you want to go.</p><p>You can carry lanterns such as this to light your way, though. They're just more commonly used for camping purposes than they are for hiking or walking somewhere in the dark. This lantern will work very nicely if you need to be able to see when the power goes out. People buy lanterns such as this all of the time just to be prepared for big storms.</p><h3>Shake Flashlights</h3><p>Shake flashlights are sort of unique in that they don't run on batteries. You might be curious how the flashlight would even work without a power source. It's actually powered by magnets that are placed inside of the flashlight itself. When you shake the flashlight, it causes a reaction and will provide you with the light that you need.</p><p>You simply need to shake the flashlight whenever you need to use it. This is very convenient as you will not have to worry about buying batteries for your flashlight. The problems with this flashlight show themselves when you notice that the light isn't very bright. The dim light of these flashlights is enough to see where you're going, but it may not be the best option for you.</p><h3>USB Charging Flashlights</h3><p>Buying batteries can be a thing of the past when you purchase a USB charging flashlight. Flashlight technology has changed quite a bit in recent years. You can now buy flashlights with built-in batteries that can charge in the same way that you charge your smartphone. Simply plug your flashlight into a USB port and it will charge up for you.</p><p>This is the most convenient type of flashlight to own in the modern era. You are most likely constantly charging some type of device in your home. Whether it is your phone, a tablet, or a handheld video game system. This can just be one more item to charge up in case of an emergency. When the power does go out, you'll have an easy to use flashlight at the ready.</p>"
wallets,"<h2>Types of Men's Wallet</h2><p>The wallets we are featuring below are our top picks. They have an ageless aesthetic that makes them preferential for the discerning gent. You might want to pick one smart and one more casual option so you can easily use one for more formal attire and another for when you have a relaxed outfit on.</p><h3>The Billfold Wallets</h3><p>It is the most used wallet by men. The choice of man and boy alike. If this is your kind of wallet then always look for leather as it will maintain its smart facade longer than other materials.</p><p>Its popularity among men is due to its functionality at being able to hold everything you need. Money, ID and cards are all snugly tucked away and if you choose the right slimline option it will sit nicely in your trouser pocket.</p><h3>Trifold Wallets</h3><p>The tri-fold wallet is a more advanced version of the bi-fold. The main difference between the two is essentially what their names imply: a bi-fold is folded into two flaps, while the trifold is folded into three flaps. The tri-fold wallet is very roomy and keeps space for basically anything that you need to keep handy. If you're looking for a wallet that will hold all of your most beloved items, including cash, cards, and even receipts, a tri-fold might be the way to go.</p><p>The tri-fold wallets contain plenty of space that can easily become overrun with unneeded items. That said, if you're looking to keep a tri-fold as your go-to wallet, it's best to ensure that it stays as neat as possible to avoid bulkiness and the chance of theft.</p><h3>The Cardholder</h3><p>For men that like a minimalist approach, then a slim cardholder is a great choice. It won't weigh down your trousers and has enough space to comfortably fit all your necessary cards.</p><p>This is the pick for a man who doesn't like to carry notes or loose change.</p><h3>The Breast Pocket Wallet</h3><p>For men looking to add a touch of timeless, sartorial flair. A larger version of the billfold, the breast wallet is ideal for being stored in the inside pocket of a suit jacket or overcoat.</p><p>This style of wallet evokes an iconic vintage twist and you can imagine the likes of James Bond in an Ian Fleming novel resting one beside his martini. If you wear suits on a regular basis then this would be a fantastic upgrade to your traditional billfold and really stand out among your peers.</p><h3>The Money Clip</h3><p>This is the pure basics of keeping your money secure. The clip will make sure your notes aren't loose in your pocket and easy to hand when you need to pay.</p><p>A money clip is as minimalist as you can get and reminds me of gangsters handing out notes in a mob film. So, for those that carry a lot of cash then this could be a great option with the style as timeless as ever.</p><h3>Zipper Wallets</h3><p>Zip or Zipper wallets are so-called due to the fact they include a zipper on them. But generally, it can get much more complex than that. Zip Wallet's, as a type, usually refers to wallets that have a full zip-around style (like the image above) where cash and cards are stored and held securely inside an internal compartment only accessible through the zipper.</p><p>As you'd imagine, Zipper wallets are much more secure than normal wallets as your cash, cards or coins are stored internally so there are no fear items could fall out. Not only that, but zip wallets are the perfect wallet for people who enjoy or carry coins with them as many varients come with a dedicated inside pocket for coins.</p><h3>Folio Wallets</h3><p>The folio wallet is one of the most popular options because it can hold up to six cards at once. It's also relatively durable, so it can last through multiple uses. The downside is that it doesn't offer much in the way of customization, so you'll have to pick a specific type of wallet if you want to use this option.</p><p>Folio wallets are made from leather or plastic and fold out like a book. They're designed to be carried around like a wallet, so they don't need to be fancy.</p><p>If you want more options, there are other wallet options that can hold more cards than the folio wallet.</p><h3>Pocket Wallets</h3><p>If you want something smaller and sleeker, pocket wallets are a great option. Pocket wallets are small enough to fit into the palm of your hand, so you can carry them around like a keychain.</p><p>They're designed to be carried around like a wallet, so they don't need to be fancy. If you want more options, there are other wallet options that can hold more cards than the pocket wallet. The options we chose were limited by size constraints, but we did include some options with larger card slots. If you want more options, check out our list of the best wallet options for 2020.</p><p>If you are looking to dress your best daily, don't let something as small as choosing the wrong wallet undo all that hard work.</p><h3>Slim Wallets</h3><p>If you've ever dealt with a bulky wallet that won't slide into your pocket, you're familiar with the value of a slim wallet. The minimalist design is meant to help you keep the essentials (and only the essentials) on your person. That means it has fewer card holding pockets and a small opening for cash.</p><p>Most don't incorporate closures, using the pressure of the design to hold your items firmly in place. The compact structure is geared towards those looking to cut through the noise and only carry the things actually necessary to function.</p><h3>RFID wallet</h3><p>A modern type of wallet, the need for protection against data theft is relatively new. Designed to block radio frequencies from accessing the cards inside the wallet, these are built to resist RFID skimming. It all comes down to the material used in construction. Leather offers a baseline level of protection, though more advanced materials like carbon-fibre and aluminum go one step further.</p><p>This type of wallet is designed for those who always carry their credit and debit cards and want to prioritize personal security.</p>"
uv flashlights,"<h2>Types of UV flashlights</h2><p>While all UV flashlights have a lot in common, there are a few different types from which to choose. It all comes down to how you plan to use the light. Professional applications rely on an intense beam that is powerful and reliable. Typically, preferred models for work have a large metal structure with a prominent handle. Generally, these will have closer to 100 individual LED bulbs. Conversely, UV flashlights for personal use tend to be more compact, often coming in a pocket-sized design. While both types rely on beams of the same wavelengths, those used personally tend to have far fewer individual LED bulbs.</p><h3>Long wave Ultraviolet Light</h3><p>Long wave UV lights have filters which screen out a lot of the visible light they produce, but not all. These filters are generally inexpensive to buy for that reason. Because of that, the black lights we use as hobbyists are a great way to produce long wave UV light. In nature, long wave UV light is present in sunlight and is not harmful to humans.</p><h3>Short Wave Ultraviolet Light</h3><p>There are two types of short wave UV light; filtered and unfiltered. As you can imagine, unfiltered UV lights allow a large amount of visible light through, rendering it useless for making many minerals glow. Too much visible light passes through and drowns out the glow. </p><p>Filtered short wave UV lights on the other hand, filter out almost all visible light, allowing only shortwave ultraviolet light to pass through. These filters can be somewhat expensive which is why high quality shortwave UV lights are so expensive when compared to unfiltered long wave UV lights.</p>"
emergency blanket,"<h2>Types of Emergency Blankets</h2><p>There are several different names for emergency blankets.</p><ul><li>Space Blanket</li><li>Emergency Blanket</li><li>Survival Blanket</li><li>Mylar Blanket</li></ul><p>In many cases, these are all the same blankets that have similar uses. What differentiates the types of blankets are really their use and the materials which are used to make them.</p><h3>Space Blanket</h3><p>In their principal usage, space blankets are included in many emergency, first aid, and survival kits because they are usually waterproof and windproof. That, along with their low weight and ability to pack into a small space, has made them popular among outdoor enthusiasts and emergency workers.</p><h3>Emergency Blanket</h3><p>Emergency blankets are an aluminium film blanket and are typically used&nbsp;to treat shock or hypothermia by retaining body warmth and preventing heat loss. They are sometimes referred to as space blankets, thermal, weather and first aid blankets.</p><h3>Survival Blanket</h3><p>Medical blanket warmers can be used to warm linens, blankets, irrigation solutions, intravenous (IV) fluids and blood. Fluids like blood and IV fluids that are warmed in a warming cabinet can help to restore a patient's body temperature to a normal range during or following a surgical procedure to avoid hypothermia.</p><h3>Mylar Blanket</h3><p>Designed by NASA, Mylar blankets are&nbsp;highly insulated and designed to reflect 90% of your body's heat. Protecting you from extreme cold weather, it helps prevent hypothermia in serious emergency situations, making it the perfect outdoor gear for camping, hiking, marathon and trail running.</p>"
nerf guns,"<h2>Types of Nerf Guns</h2><p>The truth is that there are hundreds of Nerf blasters that you can find online or in-store, even if they have long been discontinued.</p><p>To help you better determine which type of gun you need, use the following list of ten types of Nerf blasters that you can purchase right now.</p><h3>Mini-Blasters</h3><p>Mini-blasters are characterized by their small size, their low ammo capacity, and their unique cocking mechanisms. Mini-blasters are typically able to carry and shoot up to three bullets and have cocking mechanisms that need to be pulled down or back.</p><p>Along with these qualities, many mini-blasters are able to match the range of some of their counterparts and use the same type of ammunition as other blasters as well.</p><p>A Nerf mini-blaster is the type of gun you will need if you are introducing a child to Nerf or if you need an easily concealable weapon during battle.</p><h3>Nerf N-Strike Elite</h3><p>Handguns are one of the more versatile types of blasters produced by Nerf and come in handy as both a primary and a secondary weapon.</p><p>Handguns can usually be operated with one hand, have lighter bodies than the other Nerf blasters and have an ammo capacity of at least six rounds.</p><p>Despite these common characteristics, Nerf handguns vary in their build and their functionality. Some handguns use a cocking mechanisms that need to be pulled back and require manual reloading, whereas others have semi-automatic firing.</p><h3>Shotguns</h3><p>Shotgun Nerf blasters, which are mechanically similar to real shotguns, have a low ammo capacity but have the power necessary to shoot one or multiple bullets quickly at your opponent.</p><p>Nerf shotgun blasters are typically characterized by their long barrels that can shoot up to 2 foam darts, their pump action cocking mechanisms, and their lack of accuracy.</p><p>These types of blasters are great for close combat situations but should be not used for any other type of battle, as they are highly inaccurate at distances and take a while to reload.</p><h3>Rapid Fire Blasters</h3><p>Rapid fire blasters require batteries to operate, have a larger ammo capacity, and use an acceleration trigger that needs to be pulled along with the regular trigger in order to launch the bullets quickly.</p><p>Rapid-fire blasters are best suited for Nerf fanatics who need a blaster that will allow them to effectively attack their opponents with ease.</p><h3>Long-Range Blasters</h3><p>Long-range Nerf blasters can be best compared to today's sniper rifles.</p><p>These blasters often have long barrels and bodies, use ammo clips that are inserted into the bottom of the gun, and have tripod or bipod stands so that you can improve your accuracy and better support the gun's weight.</p><p>The range standard set by the Nerf Elite series is typically about 90 feet. However, long-range rifles extend this range to about 100 feet or more, depending on the type of ammunition shot by the blaster.</p><p>This category does not include blasters such as those that use high-impact rounds and manage to meet this type of range.</p><p>While useful, long-range blasters are only helpful in indoor environments that are expansive or outdoor areas.</p><h3>Nerf N-Strike Mega Series Blasters</h3><p>This series features blasters that have red and orange designs along with a Mega logo, they use mega series darts that are much larger than the average Nerf dart, and has a variety of blasters in different series as well.</p><p>Mega blasters have an advantage over other blasters due to their larger bullets. These bullets usually fly much farther than other series darts and pack more of a punch.</p><p>Blasters from the Nerf N-Strike Mega Series are good for those who need more power than the average blaster.</p><h3>Nerf RIVAL Series Blasters</h3><p>The Nerf RIVAL Series uses high-impact, foam ball rounds that are capable of reaching speeds of about 100 feet per second, use magazines to make it easier to reload during battle, and come in red and blue so players will be able to form teams.</p><p>While most of the Nerf RIVAL Series Blasters are only made to support the high-impact rounds that they were designed for, some of the blasters are capable of launching mega series darts.</p><p>Overall, a Nerf RIVAL Series Blaster is the type of gun that you will want if you plan on playing frequent, intense Nerf battles.</p><h3>Nerf Vortex Series Blasters</h3><p>These blasters use disc projectiles in place of foam darts, reach distances of about 35 feet, and their size ranges from about the size of a handgun to the size of an assault rifle.</p><p>The Nerf Vortex Series Blasters are not made well enough for Nerf gun battles but do make good gifts for those who won't use their blaster frequently or who are too young to handle the power of a Nerf dart.</p><h3>Nerf N-Strike Modulus Series Blasters</h3><p>All Nerf N-Strike Modulus Series Blasters can be customized in different ways with the accessories provided, the parts for one blaster can be used to customize any other blaster in the series, and some of the weapons are capable of shooting mega darts as well as missiles.</p><p>Some of the accessories that come with these blasters include shoulder stocks, barrel sights, and barrel extensions. These are the types of blasters that you should purchase if you want a highly modifiable weapon.</p><h3>Bow Blasters</h3><p>Bow and crossbow blasters are typically characterized by their bow-like cocking mechanism, their design that resembles a bow or a crossbow, and, sometimes, by their arrow ammunition.</p><p>Although many Nerf bows and crossbows may look like an authentic bow or crossbow, many of them do not fire in a similar fashion, especially the bows. If you are looking for real firing action, the only blaster will work is the crossbows.</p><p>Overall, bow blasters are great for those who want something that is different from the common blasters that Nerf makes.</p>"
plasma lighters,"<h2>Types of Plasma Lighters</h2><p>Aside from shape and size, plasma lighters are essentially all very similar. They all use a battery to generate intense, controlled heat. Some are built to withstand the elements and others are better suited to a candlelight dinner, but the components are largely the same. The main difference that affects performance is the number of arcs used to generate enough heat to spark a flame.</p><h3>Single-arc plasma lighters</h3><p>At a minimum, a plasma lighter must have two points separated by a small enough gap that an electrical charge can cross the gap, but far enough apart that whatever you're trying to light can fit between them. These two points create a single band of heat, called an arc. Arcs appear as purple light and are very hot.</p><p>This method generates quite a bit of heat, but applications can be limited. Candle wicks and small pieces of tinder are no problem, but the kind of damp material you might encounter at a campsite might present too much of a challenge for a single arc. Size can also be an issue. Lighting a cigarette with a single arc is easy enough, but cigars and pipes might require something larger.</p><h3>Dual-arc plasma lighters</h3><p>For a little bit more money, you can get a plasma lighter with two arcs instead of one. This configuration creates an X-shaped arc pattern that results in more heat than a single-arc plasma lighter would produce. Some combined arcs also produce enough to insert into the bowl of a pipe, which can be difficult with most single-arc plasma lighters.</p><p>This is what we recommend for most outdoor activities. Having two arcs instead of one gives you more power to work with and adds a layer of redundancy that's valuable when you're far removed from civilization. All our picks for camping and survival settings use two arcs.</p><h3>Triple Arc 360 Plasma Lighter</h3><p>The triple arc 360 degrees lighters are known for being the highest form of versatile usability. It comes with six electrodes which make it suitable for lighting larger surfaces. The 360 degrees designation simply means that this type of lighter can light from any given angle. It is powerful, has more capacity and is probably the most suitable type of lighter for camping and other purposes. Such lighters come in different designs and variants.</p><p>The placement of an electric lighter gives them different features in terms of functionality. Triple arc 360 degrees lighters are capable of producing more light and heat. However, due to a large amount of heat produced from the triple arc, these lighters can be a little intense at times which means they should be used with caution.</p>"
tactical belts,"<h2>Types of Tactical Belts</h2><p>Within the family of tactical belts for concealed carry, there are three major groups of belts: pistol belts, inner belts for use with a gun belt or battle belt, and inside-the-waistband belts for use without belt loops. These definitions include variations on these themes, as with pistol belts that either use conventional eyelets and buckles vs those who use ratcheting systems.</p><h3>Duty Belts</h3><p>These duty belts are the largest of its kind, around two inches or more. This type of tactical belt is ideal for carrying accessories on the waist and worn outside of garments, but doesn't secure the pants at all. Such a belt is compulsory for the uniformed personnel, but civilians can use it for training, shooting range, or outdoor use.</p><h3>Rigger's Belts</h3><p>These belts are 1.75 inches wide, neutral ground between a duty belt and a regular belt. A belt of this type can be worn in most pant belt loops and includes a D- or V-ring to hang a carabiner easily. It's quite versatile as we can use it in almost anything you like, such as a range rig, magazine carrier, or even hanging a pouch.</p><p>Reduce it to its simpler form, and you can use this type as an EDC belt as long as you're not wearing dress pants. If you want the best of both worlds, this type of belt would be the best choice.</p><h3>EDC Belts</h3><p>EDC belts are the smallest at 1.5 inches wide. These belts have a low-profile design, making them ideal for carrying more minimalist gear. The best of this kind is as good as tactical leather belts in terms of strength.</p><p>Though they look narrow, they're more durable than you think as they're suitable as a training/range rig. However, you get a larger belt if you plan to carry heavier gear.</p>"
backpacking sleeping pads,"<h2>Types of Backpacking Sleeping Pads</h2><p>When choosing a sleeping pad, make sure to know which kind of technology it uses. Technically all the types of sleeping pads work as camping sleeping pads or backpacking sleeping pads. Each has their merits, so some are better than others for camping or backpacking.</p><p>Keep in mind the purpose of a sleeping pad: to provide comfort and insulation during sleep, allowing you good rest and a lack of frostbitten limbs.</p><p>The three types of sleeping pads are closed-cell foam pads, self-inflating pads, and air pads.</p><h3>Self-inflating</h3><p>These products use an open-celled foam (like a sponge) sandwiched between two pieces of fabric. When the valve is open, the foam expands and inflates the pad. The foam also traps air and retains heat. It usually takes around five minutes for a new pad, but old ones with compressed foam will take longer and take more breathes from you.</p><p>Keep in mind that ""self-inflating"" is a bit of a misnomer, as all these pads need a breath or two to reach their desired firmness. Most ultralight enthusiasts eschew the convenience of the self-inflation for the weight savings of an air constructed pad. It's best to store this type of pad semi-inflated and not compressed to extend the life of the foam.</p><h3>Closed Cell Foam</h3><p>Closed-cell foam pads are probably what the general public thinks of when you say you're going camping. These classic camping mats are nowhere near as comfortable as inflatable air construction pads for some obvious reasons. They are constructed of a thin layer of foam, often with heat reflective material to add additional insulation.</p><p>One huge advantage closed-cell foam pads have is the overall durability. Since there is no vulnerable air chamber, these pads can be abused without risk of popping and leaving you with no padding. These pads are generally very light and are a perfect solution to add additional insulation to an inflatable sleeping pad.</p><h3>Air Construction</h3><p>""Air Construction"" sleeping pads have taken over the backpacking pad market. There are hundreds of different models on the market fitting this description. These pads are generally plush, light, and span a vast range of insulation levels from those capable of insulating you from snow underneath to those appropriate for summer camping.</p><p>While many of us remember sleepless nights out camping in the early 90s on closed-cell foam pads, now we can actually get some sleep in the great outdoors. At their core, Air Construction pads are thin laminated fabrics filled with air giving the user variability in pad firmness and much-needed loft above the hard ground and debris that previously caused some long nights.</p>"
self defense keychains,"<h2>Types Self-defense Keychains</h2><p>Here are some of the popular keychain weapons to go with your safety keychain set.</p><h3>Keychains with Kubotans</h3><p>Kubaton is a small stick usually made with steel, aluminum, and high-impact plastic that fits your palm. They are often grooved and the end can be either flat or slightly pointed, giving you the perfect opportunity to strike a person who's trying to assault you or an animal that's charging at you.</p><p>Kubatons fashioned into keychains are ideal for the ones who look for a personal touch with endless customizations and effectiveness at the same time.</p><h3>Keychains with Pepper spray</h3><p>Pepper spray consists of a compound called capsaicin that causes temporary blindness, immediate eye closure, burning, and produces tears when sprayed on the eyes of an attacker. This extremely useful self-defense weapon can be also attached to your keychain and protect yourself on the go. Even better, these can be legally bought and carried in every state of the USA.</p><h3>Keychains with Mini Foldable Knives</h3><p>Self-defense keychain sets also come with mini foldable knives. Their sharp blades and compact design are the epitome of safety. Not to mention, they can come in handy with other cutting tasks as well.</p><p>However, they are not only foldable but also formidable. In other words, they can concern people if seen in public and cannot be carried on planes.</p><h3>Keychains with Alarm systems</h3><p>If you're in a quest of scaring the wits out of an assailant or an animal with a keychain, you're in luck. The reason is, these keychains that feature an alarm system can emit a deafening sound powered by cheap batteries. Some even have LED lights to provide extra protection in the dark.</p><h3>Taser Keychains</h3><p>Taser keychains typically consist of a plastic or steel cylinder with a set of batteries and an electric charge. When the trigger is pressed, the charge is released from the end of the barrel, firing a small dart of electricity into the air or at an object.</p><h3>Electric Shock</h3><p>Electric shock keychains typically have two prongs that can be advanced toward each other to clamp down on a portion of the attackers body. However, this type of keychain isnt as effective as the others at deterring an aggressor because it only works when the clamps are touching the victims skin.</p>"
rangefinders for hunting,"<h2>Types of Rangefinders For Hunting</h2><p>Rangefinders are designed to perform a specific task. Each one is suited for a different type of hunting, so it's important to know which you need before making a purchase.</p><h3>Basic models</h3><p>Basic model rangefinders typically come with limited mode options. These rangefinders may be hit or miss when it comes to offering angle range compensation, so you'll want to do your research before you make your purchase. In any case, these rangefinders will usually allow you to switch between yards and meters, give you an angle reading, and have a speed setting for ranging things on the move. Typically, as the price goes up, the more functionality you'll get. This pricing correlation also applies to the durability of the device (lens glass and picture quality also usually improve with price as well).</p><h3>Ballistic models</h3><p>Rangefinders in this category will have built-in software that can offer a hunter a ballistics solution along with their range readings. The hunter is able to tailor their rangefinder to their specific needs, entering things like environmental data and cartridge information. What results is specific recommendations for sight adjustments based on all gathered data.</p><h3>Bluetooth-capable</h3><p>A few rangefinders on the market can now use Bluetooth capabilities to sync with either a smart scope of the same brand or a cell phone app. Range, environment, and ballistics information is relayed to the connected device which then either syncs accordingly or offers adjustment solutions for the best possible shot.</p><h3>Binocular rangefinders</h3><p>Some binoculars have rangefinders built right into them. If you're looking to cut down on the number of items you need to keep track of in the field, a binocular/rangefinder combo might be the way to go. Keep in mind, though, that these binoculars are often much heavier and harder to operate with only one hand like a traditional rangefinder.</p>"
long range walkie talkies,"<h2>Types of long-range walkie talkies</h2><p>Many factors contribute to walkie talkie range, including how powerful the system is and where it is used. Walkie talkie is a generic term for a radio that can be used to communicate over long distances. There are several options available, and it's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><h3>Amateur</h3><p>Amateur walkie talkies are affordable options for people who want to get into the hobby. They're made by companies like Yaesu and Kenwood, so they have a good reputation. The downside is that these radios aren't designed for professional use. You won't get features like encryption or advanced functionality. Instead, you'll get basic features like AM/FM radio and weather alerts. These radios are great for people who want to learn about walkie talkies without breaking the bank. If you want something more advanced, look at the other options in this category.</p><h3>Interactive</h3><p>Interactive walkie talkies are another option for people looking for something more advanced than an amateur radio. These are designed for professionals and offer features like encryption and advanced functionality. The downside is that they're not cheap. These options are geared toward people who want to take their walkie talkie skills to the next level. If you want something more affordable, look at the options in this category.</p><h3>Professional</h3><p>Professional walkie talkies are designed for professionals. They're expensive, so you need to make sure you're ready to shell out the cash. These options are geared towards people who want to take their walkie talkie skills to the next level. If you want something more affordable, look at the options in this category.</p>"
solar phone chargers,"<h2>Types of Solar Chargers</h2><h3>Panel-only chargers</h3><p>This is the simplest form of solar charger. It often comprises a single panel or set of easily collapsible panels and a power outlet. Since they lack power storage, these chargers deliver energy directly to your devices or power banks.</p><h3>Panels with integrated battery chargers</h3><p>These all-in-one devices come with a solar panel and battery or battery pack as a single unit. They generate power and store it for later recharging use. Their convenient construction allows you to power your devices even when the sun isn't out. Panels with integrated battery chargers are also easy to handle.</p><h3>Panels with detached battery chargers</h3><p>Some solar chargers have independent solar panels and batteries. This simplifies storage during transportation to support use in a broad range of applications. These chargers offer the flexibility to leave the solar panel at home or at a campsite and only carry the battery.</p>"
edc backpacks,"<h2>Types of EDC Backpacks</h2><p>When choosing your bag, you should keep in mind that some extra space does come in handy as there are times you need to transport something home or to the office. Just be careful not to fill that space with unnecessary gear!</p><h3>Survival</h3><p>These are the most common type of EDC backpacks. They have large capacities and are designed for survival kits. These packs are usually made out of ripstop nylon and feature MOLLE straps so you can customize them with accessories. Some even include built-in pockets for small items like batteries. These are great options if you want to go through life with a pack strapped to your back. However, they aren't the best choice if you plan to use it for everyday carry. You'll need to keep an eye on how much weight you're carrying to avoid breaking the pack. Also, these are not the most durable option. I've had one break apart after only two years of use. It's still holding up fine, but it's not the best choice for long-term storage. This is why I recommend sticking to the options below.</p><h3>Urban</h3><p>Urban EDC backpacks are like the EDC equivalent to vanilla ice cream. These backpacks often have a traditional, Jansport-esque vibe and are found in classrooms, cubicles, and coffee shops around the world. Generally, they fall into one of two subcategories: school or professional.</p><p>Urban EDC packs almost always feature a padded electronics sleeve that can house your laptop or iPad. They often sport a slick side aesthetic with little more than a couple of water bottle pouches to mix things up. Urban-style packs often come in a variety of colors to keep things fun and interesting, although this can be a significant shortcoming for you gray man types.</p><h3>Outdoor</h3><p>Some spend more time in the great outdoors than others, and for nature-loving EDC practitioners, a proper backpack is in order. Outdoor EDC backpacks are designed to pull double duty in both the backcountry and the burbs. As such, these EDC packs boast a tough construction and a handful of valuable features.</p><p>Outdoor backpacks are designed to take a beating and to help lug around tougher and heavier gear than what the typical EDC bag can handle. To accomplish this mission, these packs sport extra padding and ventilation to increase comfort. Outside, they sport external gear attachment points, glove-friendly zipper pulls, and sometimes a water bottle pouch or two. They also include internal hydration bladder pouches and hose ports, and often, these pouches double as padded laptop sleeves for maximum versatility.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>If your definition of living on the edge includes the potential for flying lead, then maybe a tactical EDC backpack may be the way to go. These EDC packs are built like a tank and can accommodate more gear than most people will ever own.</p><p>Like outdoor backpacks, these tactical EDC bags incorporate practical features into their designs, such as extra padding and ventilation, glove-friendly zipper pulls, and quick-release shoulder straps. They often have a hydration bladder pouch/laptop sleeve and a hydration hose port as well as storage space for firearms, such as a dedicated slot for your CCW, and accommodations for flex cuffs, ID patches, and other valuable accessories.</p>"
handgun safes,"<h2>Types of Handgun Safes</h2><h3>Mechanical Lock Handgun Safes</h3><p>Considered the most reliable option in handgun safes, Mechanical Lock pistol safes also known as combination lock boxes, are the premier choice for gun enthusiasts that want guaranteed access to their firearm when they need it most. With a mechanical lock, there are no batteries to replace or keys to lose, you'll have access to your handgun safe every time you need it.</p><h3>Electronic Lock Handgun Safes</h3><p>Considered the best quick access handgun safe, Electronic Lock handgun safes are the best choice for the nightstand safe. With easy to change combinations and traditionally battery operated, you'll be equipped and ready in any home defense scenario.</p><h3>Biometric Lock Handgun Safes</h3><p>Definitely the most fun option, Biometric Fingerprint handgun safes like the biometric gun vault are the latest and greatest in fingerprint safe technology. They can also be quick access safes with an opening speed of less than one second. New to the market feature biometric fingerprint scanners along with multiple other methods of entry including, smart phone access, smart keys, electronic locks and key overrides.</p><h3>Key Lock Handgun Safes</h3><p>The most simple version of the handgun safe is the Key Lock Box. You simply insert a key programmed specifically to the lock on the safe and turn. It can't get any easier than that. This is another great option for the car or airline travel where quick access is not an important factor.</p>"
field watches,"<h2>Types of Field Watches</h2><p>There are several different types of field watches, each with their own set of features and uses:</p><h3>Rugged outdoor</h3><p>Rugged outdoor field watches typically have thick protective glass, tough metal exteriors, and either waterproof or dustproof cases. They're designed to withstand being kicked around, stepped on, or dropped on hard surfaces in various weather conditions. Rugged outdoor field tend to be larger and heavier due to their protective designs.</p><h3>Standard outdoor</h3><p>Standard outdoor field watches are less durable than rugged models but still more robust than a simple plastic sports watch. They are smaller and lighter because they don't have to protect the wearer as much.</p><h3>Timing</h3><p>Timing field watches aren't suitable for rough use; these specialized watches are often only used by professionals. They are even smaller and weigh less thanks to their simpler design.</p><h3>Workout</h3><p>Workout field watches are designed to track your progress during a training program or help you manage your daily activities so you can achieve your fitness goals. They are larger but lightweight due to their inclusion of a heart rate monitor.</p><h3>Competition</h3><p>Competition field watches are worn by athletes at competitions or during practice. These types of watches are larger again but must also be able to withstand direct sunlight and high temperatures.</p><h3>Fishing</h3><p>Fishing field watches are waterproof, have a fold-over clasp, and display the time in large numbers. They are among the smallest and lightest options.</p>"
spotting scope tripods,"<h2>Types of Spotting Scope Tripods</h2><p>Spotting scope tripods come in three different varieties, which would be Table Top, Compact, and Full-Size tripods. Regardless of what type you get, expect the tripod to perform amazingly well in many situations.</p><h3>Tabletop Tripod</h3><p>Also known as a Shooter's Tripod for spotting, this type of tripod is designed to be used on platforms like a shooting bench or a table. Their heights typically measure between 8 and 18 inches. Most tripods for spotting scopes don't contain telescoping legs, which is a feature that limits their range to adjust.</p><h3>Compact Tripod</h3><p>This type of tripod is larger than Tabletop tripods, and because of their size, they are unsuitable to be used on a table. However, you can comfortably use this type while you relax and sit in a chair. If you happen to be a backpacker or a mountain hunter, you will love this type of tripod because of its high portability.</p><h3>Full-size Tripod</h3><p>If you are of average height and you prefer to use your binoculars, camera or spotting scope while standing, then you will grow to appreciate this type of tripod. A typical Full-Size tripod extends from 26 to 57 inches and can stretch to 72 inches when the center column is at its topmost point.</p>"
ghillie suits,"<h2>Types of ghillie suits</h2><p>As a consumer, you have specific needs, and buying a ghillie should be approached as an investment rather than a whim.</p><p>Types of ghillie suits are as follows:</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Finding the right ghillie for your intended purposes is a deliberate process. Ghillies designed for the tactical environment are going to be engineered to withstand the demands of the operational environment in which they will be employed. From urban to mountain operations, ghillie suits need to be constructed in such a way that they give the sniper the structure to integrate local vegetation to assist in concealment. These garments are created to be resilient against intense use that will compromise a lower-quality product. Generally, due to their weight, venting is required for increased breathability. The packability of a ghillie is worth considering since most snipers will be self-supported and this requires additional water, batteries, and optics that will fill much of a sniper's ruck.</p><p>A lightweight tactical ghillie is an attractive option. It offers most of the concealment benefits at a fraction of the weight. Increased breathability and packability are bonuses. In today's modern battlefield, these lightweight ghillies can easily be worn over issued body armor or plate carriers. They often have hoods that accommodate current ballistic helmets as well.</p><h3>Recreational</h3><p>Ghillies designed for recreational purposes will inherently lack the durability of those designed for tactical applications. They are generally lighter weight in construction and lack the quality of materials and stitching used in the aforementioned category. Due to their lighter weight, they are easier to transport, offer a good range of motion, and are breathable. A good recreational ghillie will adequately break up the human form. It should also be cost-effective for the role it's intended for.</p><h3>Hunting</h3><p>For the modern hunter, the ghillie in its 3D leaf suit variation has come full circle. Yes, you can use a traditional ghillie for pursuing a game in the field, but the 3D suit offers the same concealment and outline breakup benefits without the weight penalty. The 3D leaf suits are lightweight and breathable. Generally, they are designed to be worn over your layering system, giving them a wide range of conditions in which they can be utilized.</p><p>The hybrid ghillie is an interesting evolution for the hunter to consider. It's also a texturing technique applicable to the tactical ghillie. Combining traditional jute and garnish with the 3D cut fabric improves outline breakup.</p>"
kydex holsters,"<h2>Types of Kydex holsters</h2><p>There are several important factors to consider, including the type of holster and how it is intended to be carried, whether or not it supports your specific firearm, and whether or not it supports your attachments of choice.</p><p>Carrying a pistol for self-defense shouldn't be difficult, and these options are designed to provide something for everyone.</p><h3>Appendix</h3><p>Appendix-carry refers to holsters meant to be worn at the front of your belt, near your appendix. This type of carrying is incredibly handy if you want extremely quick access to your firearm in a defensive scenario, at the expense of some torso mobility. This is also a good technique if you want to carry a larger-than-average handgun and still have maximum concealment because it doesn't disrupt your profile from the front. However, if you're a larger individual, you may find it uncomfortable, especially if you have a lot of belly fat.</p><h3>Converted outside-the-waistband</h3><p>This is a great option if you wear a jacket often, or prefer to carry a gun on or behind your hip. This usually consists of taking a holster meant for outside-the-waistband carry and converting it to use things like pull-the-dot loops to mount to your belt. This option also works well if you prefer to have more torso mobility over the appendix, but don't mind the fact that it's often less concealable than other options, and slower than appendix-carry.</p><h3>Sidecar</h3><p>Sidecar-style holsters are for carrying a magazine carrier alongside your pistol. This allows for speedy reloads and easier purchasing, plus you know where your magazine is at all times. The Tier 1 Concealment option on this list is compatible with this option. The disadvantage to this is that the holster will always be bulkier, and can further limit torso mobility.</p>"
rain ponchos,"<h2>Types of rain ponchos</h2><p>When you want to get more out of your rain gear, such as the ability to use it as a shelter, you should do more research to ensure you get what you pay for. Find the best rain protection for your needs.</p><h3>Disposable</h3><p>A disposable rain poncho is essentially a sheet of waterproof material with a hood. It's functional and provides ample protection, but it isnt designed to do much else. You can get a few uses out of these, which may be all you need, but eventually, it'll tear as it's not made to last.</p><h3>Basic</h3><p>Like the disposable poncho, these ponchos are water-resistant or waterproof shells that you wear when needed. The arms are usually covered mid-way to provide ease of movement, and most will have buttons to allow you to close the sides somewhat to protect you from the wind. That's pretty much it. These are durable enough to last you a while, but if you tend to wear them under a backpack, then they may wear through over time.</p><h3>Multi-functional</h3><p>These are rain shells that have been designed to take advantage of having a large sheet of waterproof material while you're in remote areas. These are typically either made of thicker material or exotic lightweight material like Dyneema, that will protect from wind and rain but can be stretched underneath you or over you as a tarp tent. These will typically have reinforced grommets that will support trekking poles or 550 cord so you can set up your shelter.</p>"
closet gun safes,"<h2>Types of closet gun safes</h2><p>Gun safes come in many different sizes and configurations. The most common types are pistol-size safes, rifle safes, shotgun safes, and handgun safes. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses.</p><h3>Pistol safes</h3><p>Pistol-size safes are the most affordable option, but they're also the smallest.</p><h3>Rifle safes</h3><p>Rifle safes are great for long guns like rifles or shotguns, but they can be a bit small for handguns.</p><h3>Shotgun safes</h3><p>Shotgun safes are large enough to hold handguns, but they're expensive.</p><h3>Handgun safes</h3><p>Handgun safes are the biggest option on this list, but they're also the most expensive. There's no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a safe when you can get something smaller and cheaper elsewhere.</p>"
rolling duffel bags,"<h2>Types of rolling duffel bags</h2><p>Rolling duffel bags are large-wheeled bags with few types based on design.</p><h3>Sporty</h3><p>Were talking about the duffel with a main compartment and/or side pockets that were perfect for football, soccer, or whatever sport you needed gear for after school. These bags are simple and effective because there aren't a million places to put everything. They can be made of any material, but most often you'll find polyester. The biggest feature is the rolling system to make transporting your gear easier.</p><h3>Drop-bottom</h3><p>The next evolution in duffel bags is the drop-bottom system. This is just like a sporty-style duffel bag, except it has an extra compartment under the main pocket, thus the name ""drop-bottom"" because if you drop something, the raised walls of the compartment down under will keep it all in. These can be great for keeping clean and dirty clothes separate, or just staying organized.</p><h3>Upright</h3><p>Probably the least common style is an upright rolling duffel. These bags work a little more like a suitcase in that the openings are more vertically oriented.</p>"
hunting backpacks,"<h2>Types of hunting backpacks</h2><p>Hunting backpacks are designed for different types of hunting activities. There's a backpack for every type of game animal, and there are options for bowhunters, muzzleloaders, and even crossbow hunters. The trick is knowing which one is right for you. Here's a breakdown of the most common options to help you make an educated decision.</p><h3>Daypack</h3><p>Easily the cheapest and most common type of hunting backpack, daypacks are an often-overlooked piece of gear. Many hunters pick up a cheap pack from their local big box store with the idea that as far as daypacks are concerned, a backpack is a backpack when nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>As with their larger brothers, a well-designed daypack includes everything you need and nothing you don't. The added features, such as a hydration reservoir pouch or secure bow storage, may add a bit to the price tag, but the functionality will pay off.</p><h3>Overnight pack</h3><p>A bit larger than hunting daypacks, overnight backpacks can be a sweet spot for many hunters. Typically, an overnight bag's cargo capacity falls somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 cubic inches (25 and 50 liters), and customarily, they sport compression straps to help streamline lighter loads.</p><p>In addition to extra cargo space, these backpacks sport other valuable features. At this point, heavy loads become a more significant consideration, so pack frames, load suspensions, and meat shelves start making regular appearances.</p><p>More gear also necessitates a greater need for easier access and better organization. Besides more pockets, pouches, and sleeves, gear-specific add-ons start to become common fare, such as a spotting scope pocket.</p><h3>Multi-day pack</h3><p>Multi-day packs are the most specific form of hunting backpack. Like a traditional backpackers backpack, these hunting packs cut every possible ounce from their design while providing extra toughness and add-ons designed specifically for the unique challenges and rigors of backcountry big game hunting.</p>"
hunting boots,"<h2>Types of hunting boots</h2><p>Hunting boots come in a variety of different styles and materials. Each has its place, but it's important to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase.</p><h3>Hiking-style hunting boots</h3><p>Hiking-style hunting boots are a western hunter's go-to footwear. Big game, varmint, and turkey hunts commonly take place out on wind-swept prairies or in the high-up woods, rugged mountains, or barren desert, and such hunts demand tough, lace-up boots with solid ankle support and properly aggressive tread patterns. While the specific terrain may vary, hiking-style hunting boots help hunters tackle rough, uneven ground with comfort and ease.</p><p>Like traditional hikers, these boots include a handful of activity-specific subcategories, such as backpacking (backcountry) and mountaineering (mountain or elk hunting) boots. Compared to their conventional counterparts, hiking-style hunting boots tend to be a little heavier, usually thanks to leather uppers, heavier insulation, scent-proof liners, and one or two other hunting-specific features.</p><h3>Rubber hunting boots</h3><p>Rubber-hunting boots are a common type of hunting footwear. These waterproof hunting boots are best for low-activity hunts thanks to their tendency to retain heat and to keep feet dry and warm in wet, cold environments, such as swamps, lakes, waterways, muddy fields, or soggy forests. Waterfowl hunters looking to bag ducks and geese appreciate the unique advantages of rubber hunting boots, and countless whitetail hunters choose rubber kicks as their go-to deer hunting boots.</p><p>While traditional rubber boots are built with hot, heavy stuff, many modern rubber hunting boots employ copious amounts of neoprene with a relatively thin coat of rubber over top. Compared to rubber, neoprene is lighter and more breathable, although these boots are still a far cry from mesh running shoes.</p><h3>Upland hunting boots</h3><p>Upland hunting boots are specifically designed for hunts that take place in the relatively dry, flat terrain found throughout the Midwest. Designed specifically for hunters pursuing quail, pheasants, and other game birds, upland boots are built to handle lots of walking across open fields, plains, and other similar terrains that arent is extremely muddy.</p><p>These traditional boots may not be particularly common by today's standards, but they are built to last, thanks to their (usually) old-school all-leather construction. Most use a lace-up design, although some employ a slip-on pattern instead with elasticized shafts and/or a cinch and buckle for added security. That said, newer upland boots look a bit more like hiking-style boots, albeit with much milder lugs.</p><p>For particularly muddy hunts, it pays to go with an upland-friendly rubber boot instead of something more traditional.</p><h3>Snake boots</h3><p>While they span the categories previously described, snake boots are worth a mention. Snake boots are tall (often 18 inches) hiking-style, rubber, or upland boots with snake armor incorporated into each shaft. Usually, this armor is made up of tough, extra-thick materials, whether that be rubber, leather, tight-weave nylon, or a similar material.</p><p>Venomous snakes are a serious concern to hunters traipsing through the brush. While many hunting boots may prevent a snake's fangs from puncturing a hunter's leg when struck (especially glancing blows), protection against snake attacks is far from guaranteed. Even if they do, a pit viper's fangs can lodge in the shaft of the boot and puncture the hunter's skin when he or she attempts to remove their boot.</p><p>While snake boots will stop virtually every snake attack, they are not guaranteed to stop 100 percent of strikes. We just want to manage expectations.</p>"
shooting mats,"<h2>Types of shooting mats</h2><p>A good shooting mat is an important piece of equipment to have in your arsenal, whether you're going to the range for sight-in or out in the field looking for this season's eight-pointer. Shooting mats range from simple ground cloth to more feature-rich models with padding, pockets, and integrated bipod supports. Choose the one that best suits you.</p><h4>Field</h4><p>Field mats are designed for a balance between comfort and portability. These mats generally have minimal or no padding to reduce weight and bulk. All field mats roll up into a compact package with the smallest mats taking up less space than a one-liter Nalgene bottle. Field mats generally weigh less than three pounds, with the lightest designs weighing just one pound.</p><h4>Range</h4><p>Range mats are intended for use in established areas accessible by vehicles where the shooting stations will typically be on concrete pads or gravel. As such, range mats typically have generous padding - usually 0.25 to 0.5 inches of closed-cell foam. Range mats may also have other features such as pockets and integral bipod supports.</p>"
dry fire training systems,"<h2>Types of dry fire training systems</h2><p>Whatever your dry fire requirements are, some specific features and implications will influence which system you select, depending on the type of training you require, the weapon you choose, and the functions you demand.</p><h3>Motion sensors</h3><p>Motion sensors are accelerometers that attach to your weapon and detect things like weapon sway, trigger pull, handshaking, and other factors that would throw off your shots. These systems take these factors and use them to grade things like your grip, how far you're pulling the weapon in any particular direction when you pull the trigger, and so forth.</p><h3>Laser inserts</h3><p>Laser inserts are devices that plug the barrel of a weapon, and briefly flash a laser down the barrel when the trigger is pulled to simulate the point of impact of a fired round. These systems can take the form of a barrel or bolt swaps, or laser bullets that trigger the laser when the ""primer"" of the bullet is struck by the firing pin.</p><h3>Trigger reset systems</h3><p>Trigger reset systems allow you to get a natural trigger pull without having to manually reset the hammer of the weapon, which is essential for single-action or striker-fired pistols, and most rifles. These work by some mechanism re-cocking the trigger as soon as the shooter pulls it, allowing uninterrupted trigger pulls.</p><h3>Dry fire weapons</h3><p>Dry fire weapons are entire simulated weapon systems that replicate the function of real firearms and often include a laser as well. A good example of these is the SIRT weapons, which didn't make our list because of how specialized they are. However, for those who want a separate weapon system for total safety for professional training, these are fantastic options.</p>"
holographic sights,"<h2>Types of holographic sights</h2><p>There are two main types of holographic sights available on the market. These are various types of holographic sights you can select which is the one that best meets your requirements.</p><h3>Red dot sights</h3><p>These sights use a red LED to project a dot onto the lens. The dot is always in the same spot relative to the target, making it easy to aim. Red dot sights are typically small and lightweight, making them ideal for close-range shooting.</p><h3>Crosshair sights</h3><p>These sights use a laser to project a crosshair onto the lens. The crosshair is not affected by parallax, making it easier to keep on target at long range. Crosshair sights are usually larger and heavier than red dot sights, making them better suited for long-range shooting.</p>"
gun cleaning kits,"<h2>Types of gun cleaning kits</h2><p>Gun cleaning kits come in all shapes and sizes. As a general rule, there are two main types of gun cleaning kits: push-through and pull-through. Each has its unique strengths and weaknesses, so make sure you know what you need before you legally take possession of a new gun cleaning kit.</p><h3>Push-through</h3><p>The push-through gun cleaning kits are the most traditional setup and rely on a metal (steel, aluminum, brass, etc.) or synthetic (i.e., carbon fiber) cleaning rod to move various cleaning heads up and down the barrel. Often, these rods break down into multiple pieces to make storage easier and include a patch holder and at least one bore brush. (Other cleaning heads, such as mops, chamber brushes, and cleaning jags, usually are available for individual purchase.)</p><p>These kits require the user to remove the bolt or barrel from their gun to run brushes and other cleaning heads from the breach to the muzzle to prevent fouling, dirt, and other contaminants from collecting in and around the action, trigger, and magazine well. While it is possible to run the head in the opposite direction, make sure to use a muzzle guard to preserve the accuracy and position your gun so that contaminants fall away from the internals of your gun.</p><h3>Pull-through</h3><p>While traditional push-through gun cleaning kits rely on a metal rod to push cleaning heads through the barrel, pull-through kits operate more like a ripcord and fall into one of two categories: cleaning cable or bore snake kits. Both operate similarly, but the devil is in the details.</p><p>Pull-through cable cleaning kits operate similarly to rod-based kits. They include a pull handle and an attachment point to accept screw-on cleaning heads. They may also include multiple screw-together cables for cleaning longer barrels, again mimicking cleaning rods.</p><p>On the other hand, bore snakes combine a thick, weighted pull cord, mop, and bore brush into a single component to streamline the cleaning process. They fit into much smaller packages than traditional cleaning kits, making them incredibly handy, although since they lack interchangeable cleaning heads, a single-bore snake is limited to single-bore size.</p>"
hatchets for camping,"<h2>Types of hatchets</h2><p>Although making a hatchet is simple, there is some variation in the market that you should be aware of before selecting one to strap to the side of your pack. The distinctions are due to the materials used and the benefits they provide. The hatchets on this list are divided into three distinct categories.</p><h3>Traditional hatchets</h3><p>Hatchets have been around for thousands of years; since the days of chipping a rock into a crude edge and wedging it into a split branch. These days, traditional hatchets still look about like the ones that were used ages ago. You can spot a traditional hatchet by its wooden handle and sharpened steel edge.</p><p>This kind of hatchet is a timeless tool that's popular among people who want to keep traditional bushcraft and woodworking skills alive. We can't deny that singing a wooden handle has a satisfying feel to it that composite handles just can't replicate. You might expect these hatchets to be the most affordable, but many are the product of very skilled labor and come at a hefty price as a result.</p><h3>Composite hatchets</h3><p>As synthetic materials developed, it was only natural for them to find their way into hand tools like hatchets. Many modern hatchets use composite handles that are lighter and stronger than wood. They don't have quite the same feel, but there are good reasons to opt for one.</p><p>Composite hatchets are more durable than traditional hatchets. Water, rot, and dry air are no match for them so you can expect to get years out of yours with minimal maintenance. Sure, you can't repair one in the field, but breaking a composite hatchet is so unlikely that we wouldn't be worried about it. Better yet, they're surprisingly affordable.</p><h3>Tactical hatchets</h3><p>This gear guide wouldn't be complete without some kind of tactical element, and you can bet your overpriced combat boots that we found some solid hatchets to scratch that itch. This is a legitimate category of its own, but there is a lot of crossover with composite hatchets because wood is comparatively heavy and susceptible to the elements.</p><p>Tactical hatchets usually take lightness to a new level with thinner handles and skeletonized heads. That makes them easier to carry and in a pinch-chuck downrange. They usually come with some kind of sheath or mounting system that's compatible with the MOLLE on your assault pack.</p>"
spotlights,"<h2>Types of spotlights</h2><p>Spotlights are a great way to illuminate your backyard or patio. They're inexpensive, easy to use, and can be found at any hardware store. However, there are several different types of spotlights to choose from. Each type has its own unique set of features and benefits. Make sure you know what you want before you get into the details.</p><h4>Halogen</h4><p>For the better part of the past century, halogen bulbs have been the predominant choice for spotlights. This is because the recycling properties of halogen made the bulbs perform better and last longer at higher lumens. Each halogen bulb has a lifespan though, and it's important to keep spare bulbs at the ready.</p><h4>LED</h4><p>While LEDs have been around for longer than most believe they didn't become affordable and take off until the turn of the millennium. Light-emitting diodes have changed the lighting industry and tech industry at large by producing more light and using less energy. These types of spotlights often run longer and last longer than traditional variations ever could. The downside is that the LEDs aren't as easy to replace if they burn out.</p>"
dump pouches,"<h2>Types of dump pouches</h2><p>There are numerous dump pouches available, each with its quirks. It would be impossible to accurately divide and categorize them all, but market research has revealed that they can be broadly divided into three types to best serve the consumer: low-profile, medium-sized, and wide load.</p><h3>Low-profile</h3><p>As the name suggests, low-profile dump pouches take up a small amount of real estate but can still be a big help. They're great for guys who might only need dump pouches once in a while or are budgeting their belt real estate. Although they can often hold quite a bit, if capacity is the name of the game in your search, you may want to look at medium-sized pouches.</p><h3>Medium-sized</h3><p>The medium-sized pouch category is where most pouches fall. They are mostly your do-all pouch and can handle a wide variety of tasks. Most likely, they will take two or three MOLLE cells on your belt, which is fine because the convenience it provides largely justifies the space it takes. There are tons out there, but if you want to carry a ton of stuff, the wide load classification may be your ticket to range-day glory.</p><h3>Wide load</h3><p>Finally, we have the wide load category of dump pouches. Pouches like the LBT and CSM gear dump pouches fall into this classification. These can carry a massive amount of equipment. Anyone within eyeshot can look at you and know that you're a pack mule and probably an arsenal carrying a ton of MAGPUL AR (or AK for the more refined gents out there) mags. They usually roll up, but don't expect it to be covert or fit in your belt line because you will likely have a Cordura cylinder hanging off your backside.</p>"
survival food kits,"<h2>Types of survival food kits</h2><p>Several survival food kits and relief supplies will be made in a similar way, but there are some outliers with their own quirks that are for purchase and worth mentioning. Is it typical freeze-dried food or a ready-to-eat bag of goodies? How are these particular foods prepared? How long are these foods expected to keep? These are some important details to be aware of, so here are a few ways survival food kits can distinguish themselves.</p><h3>MRE (Meal Ready-to-eat)</h3><p>A personal favorite, military-style MREs are the quick, grab-and-go-type foods you can tear into with little to no prep at all. Emphasis on every single word in the abbreviation: Meal Ready-to-Eat. These are complete, multi-course meals bundled up in an air-tight bag. Drink mixes, a side or two, and some sort of dessert is the usual arrangement, and entrees are almost never freeze-dried. Being intended for servicemembers to use on battlefields and long journeys, the foods can be eaten cold or hot using a water-activated heater bag.</p><p>These aren't as common as the simpler kinds of survival food kits, and their pricing reflects that as a dozen surplus MREs can cost nearly $200 to order. On top of that, their methods of preservation mean that they're far more sensitive to conditions than some bag of freeze-dried goods. Keep them somewhere dry and cool, preferably below 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit to maximize their relatively short shelf life.</p><h3>Freeze-dried</h3><p>This is the method by which most, but not all survival food kits are made, and for good reason. Its simply the easiest, most reliable way to store a bounty of foods while keeping it easy to prepare and without sapping all the flavor and nutrients out of it. The process dehydrates the food to keep moisture and the microorganisms it attracts from spoiling it.</p><p>Some foods like fruits can be eaten as-is, and just about all freeze-dried foods can be rehydrated with some time in water. Hot foods only need to be soaked in boiling water for about nine to 10 minutes before being ready for consumption, and the texture of meats and noodles afterwards is comparable to home-cooked versions of the same dishes.</p><h3>Long-term emergency supply</h3><p>These will be your supplies specifically sized to feed a household for months and even years. Shipped in large buckets, multiple buckets, or even entire boxes, these emergency food supplies wont quite be the choice for buyers looking for camp grub. These are for genuine preppers and are strongly preferred to be kept in storage for the next food shortage or world crisis. Containers may hold thousands of servings and tens of thousands of calories depending on the time its intended to last.</p>"
gunsmithing tools,"<h2>Types of gunsmithing tools</h2><p>Screwdrivers are the most important tools in a gunsmith's kit, followed by a good set of punches, a good brass hammer, a gun vise, and a bench block. Finally, if you want to work on AR-15s, there are several special tools that will make your life as a gun modder much easier.</p><h3>Screwdrivers</h3><p>While it may not be obvious, gunsmithing screwdrivers and driver bits are not the same. Gunsmithing flat blade drivers are the same width from the tip to the start of the shaft rather than tapered toward the tip like a typical utility driver. Not tapering toward the tip increases the surface area in contact with the screw and decreases the chances of stripping or breaking the screw. Also, good kits have lots of flat bit widths and thicknesses custom-sized to common gun screws. Look for a kit made of a tough metal which is then hardened. While flat bits are the most commonly used, a good kit also has a set of Phillips, Torx, and hex bits.</p><h3>Punches</h3><p>At first thought, pin punches seem pretty straightforward and self-explanatory, but that first thought is very, very wrong. A thorough but not exhaustive list of pin punch varieties includes drive, starter, drift, roll, roll pin starter, and center.</p><p>The most common punches used in gunsmithing are drive pin punches and roll pin punches, with the occasional need for a starter or drift pin punch to get a stubborn pin moving. Further, punches typically come in three materials: steel (most common), brass (soft and bends easily but won't mar surfaces), and poly (avoid these).</p><p>Low-quality punches are worse than having no punch at all. They bend and break at the slightest provocation, leaving your pin stuck in place and your job stalled. A good set of punches will cost around $50.</p><h3>Hammers</h3><p>A good gunsmithing hammer will have both a brass and a nylon face as neither will mar the finish on your gun. These hammers are generally lighter than a utility hammer because gunsmithing work is typically more delicate than framing a house. The one exception is starting a stuck pin - you'll want a heavier hammer for that.</p><h3>Gun vise</h3><p>A gun vise should be fairly heavy-duty, as you need it to support the entire weight of a full-sized rifle while you potentially apply copious torque to a stuck barrel, for example.</p><h3>Bench block</h3><p>Made mostly for handgun assembly/disassembly, these handy blocks have grooves and holes designed to aid in removing and inserting pins, springs, and other components. The block should be very sturdy and made of a non-marring material (most are poly of one type or another).</p>"
camping lighters,"<h2>Types of camping lighters</h2><p>There are various types of lighters on the market, and how well they work will vary. Let's see what they are.</p><h3>Butane</h3><p>Very common type of lighters we find are each of them uses different butane fuel to light up. You can hold on to the button for continuous flame and if fuel runs out you can refill.</p><h3>Jet/ Torch</h3><p>These types of lighters use Butane fuel to work. The light comes out through a special nozzle working out like a carburetor by blending air and fuel for a higher burn rate.</p><h3>Plasma/ Electric</h3><p>Rechargeable lithium-ion battery plays the role here generating electricity or a plasma band between two of the prongs.</p><p>In addition to the main types of camping lighters here, we find electric coil type lighters that use in cars, flint type that uses flint-stone or metal and should hit hard on something to get sparks, and disposable lighters which are not very good options by today in concerned being an environmentally-healthy but easy to use.</p>"
biometric gun safes,"<h2>Types of biometric gun safes</h2><p>Biometric gun safes are designed to keep firearms secure. There are three main types of these safes, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Gun safes all perform the same basic function, but they do so in slightly different ways. Here are some of the different types and features that can help a biometric safe stand out in a crowded market.</p><h3>Compact/portable</h3><p>Small and compact, they can fit in a variety of nooks that larger, refrigerator-sized safes can't squeeze into. They can be taken inside cars and campers (although, keep in mind the laws of your area with weapons inside vehicles) or stowed in cabinets and nightstands. Their placement is entirely up to your imagination with relatively no limitations.</p><p>Their sizes can be their biggest asset or your biggest annoyance, so pay attention to the sizes of each product by where you want them placed and what will be stored inside. Some safes advertised as two-gun or multiple-gun safes may only fit one depending on how big your Big Iron is, and some may be too thick to fit in some drawers.</p><h3>Rifles</h3><p>These are the mini-bank vaults masquerading as refrigerators intended for rifles, shotguns, and any long firearms you can think of. As expected, these will be the most spacious and can come in a variety of sizes to match anyone's collection. Need space for five guns? Ten guns? Twenty guns? There's a size to match. These will often have the most robust construction, immune to prying and built to insulate their contents from housefires.</p><p>Rifle safes will also be the most expensive due to all the materials they use as well as the largest, most cumbersome safes to place at home. They take up space like a fridge and weigh half as much as a small hatchback in the case of some larger safes, but these are your best bet for keeping long guns secure at home.</p><h3>Multi-lock</h3><p>Most, but not all, biometric gun safes will fall under this category. Building upon their role as quick-access safes, multi-lock biometric safes will have multiple locking methods from keypads to combinations and even manual keys. This creates redundancy and allows users to choose their preferred methods or lets them select a secondary locking system in case their preferred system fails.</p>"
gun safes,"<h2>Types of gun safes</h2><p>Gun safes are designed for different uses. Some are meant to store handguns, while others are designed for long guns like rifles or shotguns. The safe you choose will depend on your needs.</p><h3>In wall gun safes</h3><p>When discussing in-wall gun safes, there are two main categories:</p><ul><li>A wall-mounted gun safe, which is a small free-standing safe that has been installed into a wall within your home. This can be in a cupboard, bookshelf, wall, or even on the floor.</li><li>When you say ""in-wall gun safe"" you may be thinking of a vault, which is a separate room dedicated to secure storage, secured with a vault door.</li></ul><h3>Gun safes and handgun vaults for cars</h3><p>There are several considerations when looking for the right gun safe or handgun vault for use in a vehicle. If you want the ultimate in security and theft prevention and don't mind a few extra steps for gaining access to your gun, a hardened steel lockbox or handgun vault mounted in the trunk is often the best choice, depending on your situation.</p><h3>Bedroom/Nightstand safes</h3><p>A handgun vault, key vault, or similar small, quick-access safe can be a good choice for secure firearm storage on or near your bed, for emergency access. In some cases, this may be your only firearm safe, or you may utilize a smaller handgun vault to supplement your primary home safe.</p><p>Obviously, a more portable handgun vault doesn't provide the same level of theft prevention as a full-size gun safe, and in many cases, you lose fire protection as well. But for people who want secure handgun storage with ready access near the bed, these smaller handgun vaults can be a solid choice.</p><h3>The best hidden gun safes</h3><p>Several companies offer integrated gun storage methods that conceal firearms in electronically or magnetically access panels in furniture, below shelving, behind picture frames or mirrors, in roll-out wall panels, in coffee tables or concealment tables), or similar. The concept here is for your firearm to be hidden in plain sight while allowing somewhat rapid access when desired.</p><p>It should be noted that with rare exceptions, this type of storage is not as secure nor is it as fire-resistant as a dedicated gun safe. But when keeping a firearm hidden is more important than keeping it safe from damage from fire or humidity (or in preventing access by a knowledgeable thief), this type of firearm storage may be appropriate for you.</p>"
digital watches,"<h2>Types of digital watches</h2><p>There is no particular style when it comes to digital watches, however, they are divided into several categories making it simple for you to select one. Casual, fashion, luxury, and sport are the broad categories of digital watches.</p><h3>Casual</h3><p>These digital watches are intended for casual use. They are inexpensive, comfortable to wear and come in both traditional and modern styles.

These watches synthetic materials for the band and face due to their exposure to sweat, dirt, and other elements.</p><h3>Fashion</h3><p>These digital watches are more understated and traditional in appearance than casual watches. They do, however, have abstract designs. Metal is used in the design of the majority of these watches.</p><h3>Luxury</h3><p>These watches are made of high-quality materials and are pricey. They are made of precious metals, most often gold, and contain precious stones embedded in their designs.</p>"

headlamps for hunting,"<h2>Types of headlamps</h2><p>Headlamps come in many different shapes and sizes, but there are a few things you need to know before you make your final purchase. We'll break down the options below so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Incandescent headlamps</h3><p>The most common type of headlamp is the incandescent bulb. These are cheap, compact, and easy to use. They're also great for camping or emergency preparedness kits because they don't require batteries. The downside is that they're inefficient, which means you'll have to spend more money on electricity to run them. Also, they're not very durable, so you'll have to replace them often.</p><h3>LED headlamps</h3><p>These are the most popular headlamps today. They're efficient, long-lasting, and durable. They're also affordable, making them a great option for beginners. The downside is that they're expensive. You'll have to pay at least $100 for one of these. That's why we recommend getting started with incandescent headlamps first. Once you get comfortable with that, you can move up to LED headlamps. If you want to save some money, check out our list of the best budget LED headlamps.</p><h3>Fluorescent headlamps</h3><p>These are another option worth considering. They're inexpensive, compact, and easy to use. However, they're not as efficient as LED headlamps, so you'll have to spend more money on electricity to run them. Also, they're not durable, so you'll have to replace them often. Still, they're worth checking out if you want to stick to a budget.</p><h3>Solar headlamps</h3><p>This is powered by the sun. They can be stationary or portable light fixtures with rechargeable batteries, photovoltaic solar panels, controllers, and LED lamps. They do not require any wiring because they are powered by solar radiation.</p>"
rifle cases,"<h2>Types of rifle cases</h2><p>When purchasing a rifle case, keep in mind the key features and what you need the case to do. Shoulder straps, hard or soft, long-term storage, TSA compatibility, and additional storage space are all important considerations.</p><h3>Hard case</h3><p>These are your classic tough, box-style, hard-sided cases. Usually made from injected-molded plastics and clip shut, they can run the widest range in quality. Many rifles will come in their own cheaply manufactured hard cases, with flimsy clips that barely latch and hinges that are prone to break, but on the other end of the spectrum, you see enormously well-constructed bunkers with pressure relief valves, dual wall construction, and laser-cut foam cutouts on the inside. Pelican famously used to drop its rifle cases out of a helicopter to demonstrate the ruggedness of construction, and there are now several competitors in that range of high-quality construction.</p><h3>Soft case</h3><p>Soft rifle cases are your classic soft, handbag-style carry cases, usually complete with padded interiors to protect the rifle from impact. They're lighter, easier to carry around, pack in a trunk and work with in general, at the cost of less protection. These can often overlap with drag bags, especially when enough extra storage pouches are slapped on. You'll also see backpack-style soft cases, usually for hunters who need to travel long distances into the woods with all their gear, in addition to a scoped rifle they want to protect from the elements.</p><h3>Drag bag</h3><p>Drag bags started as a military rifle carry option where it was necessary to have a durable soft case bag that carried all the assorted accouterment associated with the weapon stored inside. Called so because of their ability to be dragged behind a crawling sniper in the field, they have evolved into a reliable rifle case option in their own right. The hallmarks of a drag bag are extensive storage and high-quality protective construction. Think of it as a go-bag for the gun inside, bearing all the magazines, accessories, and maintenance gear the weapon needs to function in the field, and you've got the right idea. Many drag bags even still bear a loop at the top, used for the dragging that gave this class its name.</p>"
generators for camping,"<h2>Types of camping generators</h2><p>Camping can take many different forms, so it stands to reason that the best camping generators will come in a variety of shapes and sizes as well. After you've calculated your electrical requirements through a thorough gear audit, you'll need to consider how you'll generate and store that amount of power.</p><h3>Fuel-burning generators</h3><p>There are a few reasons fuel-burning generators have stood the test of time. First, combustible fuel is relatively cheap and abundant. For just a few dollars, you can run a gas-powered generator for hours. Refilling your generator tank takes a few seconds, and modern internal combustion engines are extremely reliable.</p><p>On the other hand, there's something about venturing into the quiet wilderness and firing up a noisy, exhaust-belching generator that doesn't sit well with a lot of people. Fuel-burning generators also require you to carry all the fuel you'll need, which can get heavy and potentially messy. If you need a whole lot of power with little to no downtime, the pros outweigh the cons. Otherwise, the next category might be what you need.</p><h3>Solar generators</h3><p>Solar generators are experiencing rapid growth in popularity, partially as a result of technological improvements that are making them more efficient and easier to carry than ever before. Unlike fuel-burning generators, solar-powered energy banks are very quiet or completely silent, produce no emissions, and can draw power directly from the sun. Theyre is just as popular with environmentally conscious campers and off-grid preppers.</p><p>The biggest drawback of solar generators is the amount of time it takes to recharge the battery. Instead of spending a few seconds pouring fuel into a tank, you'll need several hours of intense sunlight and large, expensive solar panels. If you have plenty of sun and time to wait, a solar generator is probably your best bet for camping.</p><h3>Power banks</h3><p>Full-size generators are great for camping trips that involve an Overlanding vehicle, RV, or boat, but they're way too big and heavy for backpacking or carrying into the field for personal use. If you weigh your gear in ounces, a power bank is all you can afford to carry.</p>"
tactical knives,"<h2>Types of tactical knives</h2><p>Tactical knives come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Whatever task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, you're likely to find a tactical knife that meets your requirements. There are types of tactical knives that fill a specific role.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>Any knife with a blade that is ""fixed"" in place and one that is securely affixed to the handle and lacks a pivot is considered a fixed blade. In many ways, they're the polar opposite of pocket knives. Unless sheathed, the blade is always visible. Due to the lack of a complicated locking mechanism, they are straightforward, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly. The more resilient fixed blades are designed with a full tang, where the portion of the blade inside the handle has the same shape as the handle. Unfortunately, most inexpensive fixed blades are not; they contain a weak metal ""tail"" that is frequently epoxied or pinned inside the handle and are more prone to breaking.</p><h3>Folding</h3><p>Also known as pocket knives, folders are compact knives that contain at least one blade that folds into the handle, preventing the need for a bulky sheath. Conveniently carried in your pocket, they're legal in most municipalities and can be extremely handy for everyday tasks. Some are quite, but the majority will have blades between three to four inches in length. Folders are extremely versatile, despite being typically smaller and weaker than their fixed blade brethren.</p>"
ultralight sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of ultralight sleeping bags</h2><p>Based on their design, ultralight sleeping bags are classified as Mummy Bags or Quilts. However, there are numerous variations and hybrids of these two simple designs.</p><h3>Mummy Bags</h3><p>Mummy bags are the most common style of the three-season sleeping bag. They are designed to enclose you completely like a mummy and are shaped just like the Pharaohs you can see at the museum. They are narrow at the feet and legs and wider through the torso. Most mummy bags have a large hood that fully covers your head and can be cinched tight around your face to allow only the tiniest opening to breathe through, thereby giving you the very best protection against the cold. Mummy bags help you stay warm by only leaving a small amount of space inside the bag that is unfilled by your body, meaning less air to heat. This also makes them feel constricted and claustrophobic. Compared to quilts, these bags tend to be the easiest to use, as the design is familiar to most and less complicated.</p><h3>Backpacking Quilts</h3><p>Down quilts are a versatile solution to the feeling of constriction that is inherent in a mummy bag design. They also manage to save weight by not including as much material or insulation and also nixing the hood and zipper. The basic premise is that to be an effective insulator, down needs to be able to loft up and create space that traps air. When you are sleeping on top of the down, it is fully compressed, thereby losing the vast majority of its insulating abilities.</p>"
paracord bracelets,"<h2>Types of paracord bracelets</h2><p>When most people hear the word ""paracord,"" they immediately think of the seven-strand, 550-pound rated version from which most of these bracelets are made. Other sizes and materials fall under the paracord label as well. Let's take a look to make sure you have the best survival cord available.</p><h3>Mil-spec</h3><p>To start with, there is a paracord made to military spacifications and paracord that isnt. One of the key requirements is that the cord is made from nylon. For the 550-rated paracord, there must be seven to nine core strands as well. Unless your cord is marked, it can be difficult to identify paracord as mil-spec.</p><h3>Nylon</h3><p>Having been around for many decades, nylon is commonly found in clothing and various other products. It is a plastic-based fiber that is stronger than other naturally occurring fibers. Nylon will melt when exposed to a flame.</p><h3>Polyester</h3><p>Another synthetic fiber, polyester, is often cheaper than nylon. This is the material of choice for lesser-quality paracords as its moreit'sfordable. The downside is that it isnt as strong as nylon, which is why polyester paracord doesnt cut the mil-spec mustard.</p>"
field jackets,"<h2>Types of field jackets</h2><p>Field jackets come in all shapes and sizes, so it's important to know what you're getting into before you make a purchase.</p><h3>M-65</h3><p>This is the classic military jacket. These jackets all share the hallmarks of the original design: the stowable hood, large pockets, and a detachable liner for extra warmth in cold conditions. They're usually a cotton/poly blend for better water resistance and durability, and many are treated for additional waterproofing.</p><p>The nice thing about an M-65 is the tried-and-true design. It's been field-tested to death, so you know it's going to work when you most need it without fail. Another benefit? The internal liner is just a woobie shaped like a coat, and it's impossible to be unhappy about that. Everybody loves their woobie.</p><h3>Hunting jackets</h3><p>Hunting field jackets tend to deviate a bit from the classic M-65 design philosophy, with synthetic materials or oilskin being more prevalent and hoods being less common, but they keep a lot of the features we love. Lots of large pockets, superb warmth, and excellent weather resistance are all hallmarks.</p><p>Another difference is the fit where the classic design is deliberately oversized and baggy, hunting jackets tend to be a little more form-fitting and snug. This helps avoid snagging on branches and underbrush as you move through the woods, but a good hunting jacket achieves this without sacrificing freedom of movement.</p><h3>Workwear</h3><p>Many workwear companies have their own field jacket style designs, but they can be a stark departure from the original design. As with hunting jackets, hoods are less common, and they often lack the abundant storage space as other options.</p>"
molle pouches,"<h2>Types of molle pouches</h2><p>MOLLE is an acronym that stands for ""MOdular Light Load-carrying Equipment."" It is also known as PALS, which stands for ""Pouch Attachment Ladder System."" MOLLE works by stitching rows of nylon straps down in 40mm increments to form a series of loops. You weave straps found on the back of MOLLE-compatible pouches through these loops, which secures the pouch to whatever mounting surface it is attached to.</p><p>Magazine pouches come in a variety of sizes and shapes. , In general, there are four major types of magazine pouches: cloth, thermoplastic, hybrid, and leather. Take a look at the different types and what they're typically used for.</p><h3>Cloth</h3><p>These are the simplest, and often most cost-effective types of pouches on the market. At their core, they're a cloth bag, usually made of nylon Cordura, with some sort of closure on top, be it a velcro flap, a snap flap, a bungee, or some other mechanism. These pouches are also the most common on the surplus market, having been around since the advent of MOLLE, and so they can be had for very cheap if you're on a budget. The advantages that they have is that they usually work well with at least one of most magazines and that they're fairly easy to use for re-indexing. The disadvantage is that generally their flap closures can get in the way during reloads, and they have no form of inherent retention beyond the flap.</p><h3>Thermoplastic</h3><p>These pouches (or carriers as I prefer to call them since they aren't a bag) are made of flexible thermoplastic, which is a substance that includes the Kydex family of materials. This allows manufacturers to mold magazine carriers to specific magazines, firearms, and other implements, and have them securely held with no need for other retention in most cases. The advantage to this type of carrier is that they offer positive retention with no need for bungees, straps, or flaps, and instead rely on friction from the molded plastic to hold the magazine in place, which makes them some of the fastest on the list. The downside to these is that they're often only compatible with one or two types of magazine, and aren't flexible in allowing non-standard types of magazines, should you be a weirdo who uses G36 magazines or AUG magazines.</p><h3>Hybrid</h3><p>These pouches use a combination of cloth and other materials to provide their retention, whether through the use of gripping material, elastic tension, thermoplastic inserts, or some other type of solution. These pouches seek to offer a best of both worlds approach and often include both thermoplastic liners and some other form of optional retention. The advantage to these pouches is that they solve the biggest issue with many of the pure cloth or purely thermoplastic options, providing a mixture of retention and flexibility. The disadvantage is large that they inherit some of the issues of both cloth and plastic magazine carriers and the fact that they're oftentimes still very pricey.</p><h3>Leather</h3><p>This isn't an option that I discussed on this list, largely for the reason that we were speaking about rifle magazines and the fact that I wanted every pouch on this list to have some sort of military usage. Leather is possibly the oldest ammo-carrying solution, oftentimes offering intricately embossed designs, brass hardware, and other stylish choices. The advantages of leather largely boil down to style and comfort. Not much looks nicer than well-tanned and finished leather and it's very comfortable to wear on your belt in a concealment environment. Additionally, this may be the only option for pouches if you're in a law enforcement environment, due to departmental restrictions or a desire for uniformity. The disadvantage of leather is that it doesn't play well with moisture, doesn't offer the cost-effectiveness of cloth or the rock-solid retention of thermoplastic, and has limited options for securing the pouch.</p>"
camping mugs,"<h2>Types of camping mugs</h2><p>Camping mugs come in a variety of different sizes, shapes, and materials. Each has its place in the world of backpacking, car camping, or hiking. The following are some examples of camping mugs you can find on the market today.</p><h3>Tumbler</h3><p>Tumbler-style coffee cups are the most popular and versatile. They tend to be tall and tapered toward the bottom, shaped similarly to the water glass.</p><p>The lack of a handle makes them fit easily into cup holders. While usually not completely spill-proof, their lids prevent total spills and help retain heat and cold.</p><h3>Thermos/Flask</h3><p>These tend to be completely spill-proof and prioritize insulation over ease of drinking. They are best for people who want to keep their drink hot or cold all day long.</p><h3>Mug</h3><p>Certain camping mugs are closer in design to the classic ceramic mug. They are shorter and broader with a built-in handle. The handle makes them more comfortable to hold, but it also prevents them from fitting in most cup holders, limiting their use.</p><h3>Brand-specific</h3><p>Some camping mugs come included with mess kits or camping cookware sets. They usually fit snugly into the sets of other containers or cookware, making packing them a cinch. However, they aren't that good at insulating and are sometimes awkward to drink out of.</p>"
machetes,"<h2>Types of machetes</h2><p>Machetes come in a variety of styles and sizes. The machete has evolved many styles, features, and adaptations for specific uses and environments throughout its long history in many rural areas around the world. Names and styles vary by region and frequently overlap, so the same machete may be referred to by different names in different areas. Preferences for one style over another are generally subjective, and, as with many other things, are heavily influenced by region, tradition, and experience. When choosing a machete, the most important consideration is what feels right to you.</p><h3>Barong Machetes</h3><p>Barong machetes are known for their unique leaf-shaped blade, which is traditionally only sharpened on one side. The traditional cutting tool of certain tribes in the Philippines, the barong was feared by European colonizers for its ability to cut through rifle barrels.</p><h3>Billhook Machetes</h3><p>The billhook machete is an ancient agricultural cutting tool with a curved blade meant for chopping around objects, such as tree trunks, and for "" snedding"", which is the process of stripping side shoots and buds from a branch. The hooked blade, sharpened on the inner curve, is ideally suited for gripping and cutting vines and brambles.</p><h3>Bolo Machetes</h3><p>The bolo machete is popular in Southeastern Asia where it is commonly used as a farming and agricultural tool. The bolo machete excels as a harvesting tool for narrow row crops, such as rice, soybeans, peanuts, and mung beans due to the distinctive bulge, adding heft to the fore blade that provides additional chopping power.</p><h3>Bowie Machetes</h3><p>The Bowie machete features a clip-point or skinner tip for skinning wild game. This style is named after American frontiersman Jim Bowie and is popular amongst survivalists and backwoodsmen.</p><h3>Bush Machetes</h3><p>A popular all-purpose machete with a normal, straight back blade. The blade tends to be evenly weighted and fairly stout. Very portable, and can be fitted with a sheath easily for carrying around.</p><h3>Cane Machetes</h3><p>Wide, blunt-tipped machetes perfect for hacking corn stalks and sugar cane. Often the blade is hooked to allow the user to pull the chopped cane from the plants still standing. The thin blade thickness allows for easy cutting through cane-style vegetation.</p><h3>Colima Machetes</h3><p>Sharpened on both sides of the blade to allow for a sweeping cut motion on both the fore and backhand strokes. Colima machetes are typically weighted on the back side for aid in clearing the backstroke.</p><h3>Hawkbill Machetes</h3><p>A curved or hooked machete that can be sharpened on both sides or the inside of the curve. The sharpened tip concentrates force on a sharp point allowing it to pierce and cut very hard materials, while the inner curve facilitates the reaping and collecting of stalked vegetation.</p><h3>Kukri</h3><p>Kukri have 3 parts to their blade, a pointed tip for stabbing, a wide midsection for chopping, and a narrow area near the handle for whittling and carving.</p><h3>Pang Machetes</h3><p>Machete design popular in Africa and the Caribbean. A deep belly provides weight for chopping and curvature for slicing. The upturned point can concentrate force on a small area for piercing.</p><h3>Parang Machetes</h3><p>Parang machetes, also known as Golok machetes, generally have a distinctive curved shape in which both the spine and the edge of the blade are curved, much like a scimitar. They tend to be long and either slightly weighted or fairly evenly weighted, and usually have a thick blade.</p><h3>Weighted/Heavy Machetes</h3><p>The workhorse of the machetes. The terms ""weighted"" or ""heavy"" refers to how the weight is distributed in the blade design. The heavy or weighted machete has the bulk of the weight towards the top of the blade to make chopping thick and woody vegetation easier.</p>"
backpacking backpacks,"<h2>Types of backpacking backpacks</h2><p>External frame, internal frame, and frameless backpacks are the three types of backpacking packs. In terms of size, they are measured in liters and are commonly referred to as daypacks, weekend backpacks, multi-day backpacks, and extended trip/expedition packs.</p><p>The various frame styles can be perplexing, especially if you have no prior experience backpacking or rucking. Look for the backpacks for backpacking listed below.</p><h3>Frameless backpacks</h3><p>This type is very light with flexible construction and is designed to carry light loads. A frameless backpacking pack lacks any rods or frame sheets to distribute weight. They generally do hold more than 40 liters and are not meant to carry a heavy load.</p><h3>Internal frame backpacks</h3><p>This type is the most popular type of backpacking pack available, and features a more rigid construction that distributes weight more, and keeps the backpacking pack from collapsing. They're often made with a frame sheet on the inside.</p><h3>External frame packs</h3><p>This type features a frame often made of aluminum on the outside, with a harness attached to it. They're used for carrying very heavy loads. They are not as commonly available in modern times, but some companies still offer this style due to their highly adjustable style, and customizable nature.</p>"
gun safes under 500,"<h2>Types of gun safes</h2><p>There are several high-quality gun safes under $500 on the market right now. The most difficult challenge will be selecting a safe that is both secure and reliable. With so many unknown manufacturers producing products in this market, you must exercise caution.</p><p>Choose the best gun safe for less than $500.</p><h3>Long gun safes</h3><p>These are what we traditionally see and think of when we think of gun safes - a big, tall, sturdy safe with a large door that swings open to reveal rifles and shotguns lined up along the interior walls with some shelves for handguns and ammo. These safes tend to be bulky and hard to move but offer great protection from theft and fire because they can be secured to the ground with bolts and have plenty of insulation protecting your investments from fire damage.</p><h3>Handgun safes</h3><p>Handgun safes tend to be much smaller and have limited space. Most can be bolted down to the ground to prevent someone from simply picking them up and walking away. Quality handgun safes have insulation to protect against fire damage and flooding, while cheaper options will only offer the bare minimum level of protection against theft or child access. Some handgun lock boxes can be mounted to a bed frame and be opened quickly with the firearm being in an easy-to-access position allowing for a full firing grip from the get-go.</p><h3>Lockboxes and locking cabinets</h3><p>These options can be used when security is not a major concern as they offer the lowest level of security. A few minutes with a simple crowbar and any thief with some upper body strength will be walking away with some shiny new guns. If a lock box or cabinet is going to be your choice, it would be wise to layer your home security with things such as heavy doors, alarm systems, big scary dogs, etc., because these safes are not going to slow someone down on their own.</p><h3>Hidden safes</h3><p>Hidden safes come in different forms, but most of the time they require the user to cut a hole in the wall of their home and secure the safe to the studs. Up until recently, these safes followed more traditional designs and would require that the user place something over the front to conceal the door. Today, there are more options with everything from shelves to mirrors that are both ""safe"" as well as concealment furniture. Safes that are hidden in plain sight can help mitigate the risk of a burglar finding where you keep your guns if they are just inside for a short amount of time in a smash-and-grab type of robbery. Most thieves will know to look in the common areas for unsecured firearms such as under the mattress, inside a closet, or in a dresser, so having a more incognito place to put your guns could work better in some cases.</p>"

go bags,"<h2>Types of go bags</h2><p>There are a lot of options out there for go bags. It can be overwhelming to pick the right one, so we've narrowed it down to four categories based on what you need it for.</p><h3>Get-home bags</h3><p>Get-home bags are designed to be light and comfortable. You should be able to run at least a mile without difficulty. The bag you choose should also be small enough to be stored out of sight in your car so it's always there when you need it without drawing unwanted attention. Choose a color that's subdued and makes sense for your environment - camouflage isn't a great option for urban environments, but shades of brown and green are pretty versatile.</p><h3>Three-day bags</h3><p>The consensus for midsized go bags is that they should be able to sustain a person for three days. That covers food, water, first aid kit, ammunition, clothing, and anything else you might need. These bags tend to be in the 30- to 50-liter size range and should have some way to add gear with MOLLE panels. While you probably wouldn't want to run more than a few hundred yards wearing a three-day bag, you should still be able to cover ground at a good clip with short bursts of running and climbing when necessary.</p><h3>Long-term go bags</h3><p>In a worst-case scenario, you may not be able to return home. Circumstances may force you to keep moving for weeks on end or cover great distances on foot. In that case, your pack will look more like something an Appalachian Trail through-hiker would use than what you'd see during a week-long field exercise. Simply put, your pack should be able to sustain you indefinitely.</p><p>That means that instead of food and water, you'll need to bring equipment for acquiring food and water. Maybe a sleeping bag and small tent are worth some extra weight.</p>"
4 season tents,"<h2>Types of 4-season tents</h2><p>There are a lot of options when it comes to buying a tent. The good news is that most tents can be used for more than one season, so you can get the right fit without breaking the bank.</p><h3>Mountaineering</h3><p>Mountaineering tents are built for high-alpine environments with weight as a primary consideration. Many of these tents are of the single-wall variety and make few compromises in terms of wind and weather protection. Square footage tends to be lower than base camping and treeline tents, and the same goes for peak height. Almost all mountaineering tents are waterproof, or easily seam-sealed, with one exception, being the lightweight</p><h3>Basecamp</h3><p>4-season tents of the base camping variety are more comfortable and heavier than their mountaineering siblings above. You may not have to carry your tent as far or as high, and therefore you can get away with packing more weight (and getting more tent in return). In addition, you'll likely end up spending more time in a basecamp-style tent. Mountaineering tents are designed for fast and light adventures and summit pushes, but base camping can be done in a variety of circumstances and conditions. Many of these tents have a double-wall design, which helps with ventilation, condensation prevention, and space, all at the expense of weight.</p><h3>Treeline</h3><p>Treeline tents are the most trimmed-down 4-season models on the market. As the name implies, they are designed for winter camping but not necessarily for heavy exposure in the high mountains. Compared to a 3-season version, a treeline tent will have a more substantial bathtub floor, less mesh, and heavier canopy and rainfly fabrics. But these tents fall short of basecamp and mountaineering models in terms of their toughness and durability, and it's best not to put them to the test. They are, however, a nice option for light winter adventuring and serious 3-season backpacking in unpredictable weather.</p>"
gun cases,"<h2>Types of gun cases</h2><p>Since gun cases are sized to fit specific firearm types, such as handguns or long guns, they are organized based on the materials used to create the case, the quantity of guns it can hold, and whether or not the case looks like a gun case.</p><p>Gun cases come in many different sizes and configurations. The most common types are pistol cases, rifle cases, shotgun cases, and handgun cases. Each category has the unique features that make it a good choice for certain shooters.</p><h3>Hard shell case</h3><p>A hard gun case offers the most protection out of all the types of gun cases. They're constructed from either metal or a durable polymer shell, and the interior is lined with foam padding. Together, they protect the contents from environmental threats and impact. Compared to a soft case, a hard case is bulkier, but it's a must if you plan on traveling with a firearm.</p><h3>Soft shell case</h3><p>A soft shell gun case is meant for quick access and flexibility, such as range or hunting trips. They're made out of materials like nylon, polyester, and leather with some padding. Additionally, soft cases offer a range of storage options. You can find simple designs that just carry a gun and others with multiple pockets for magazines and other gear.</p><h3>Multi-gun case</h3><p>A multi-gun case is not limited to being a hard or soft shell, but rather a design that's large enough to carry multiple firearms.</p><h3>Discreet gun case</h3><p>Gun cases that don't look like gun cases are growing in popularity. More often than not, they're referred to as discreet gun cases. Sometimes they're shaped like a guitar case, violin case, tennis bag, or just a backpack.</p>"
aviator sunglasses,"<h2>Types of aviator sunglasses</h2><p>There are various styles and materials that today's aviators are made from, as well as which lenses will give you the best overhead sun protection and color saturation so that you can see better and look great whether you're flying the wild blue yonder or just out and about. Here are the styles to consider.</p><h3>Classic Teardrop</h3><p> It's the classic aviator look. If you're buying an aviator because you want to tap into its rich, high-octane heritage, then go with it. On a functional basis, the teardrop shape provides the most coverage from sunlight.</p><h3>Navigator</h3><p>The Navigator aviator sunglasses are a classic style with a modern twist. The lenses are a gradient brown, which gets darker at the top to block out the sun. The frames are made of lightweight metal, and the arms have a slight curve to them for a comfortable fit. It's more squared off than the teardrop shape and will set you apart from the rest of the aviator-wearing crowd and is an ideal shape for men with longer faces. If you're looking for a new take on a timeless style, the Navigator aviator sunglasses are the perfect choice.</p><h3>Sporty</h3><p>If you have an active lifestyle and you want to sport some aviator shades while biking or running, check out the more sporty-shaped lenses some companies are putting out. Sporty aviators have a squared-off bottom, but the lenses themselves are wider, which allows them to wrap around your face to help keep more sun out. Because they're squared off at the bottom, sporty aviators aren't going to be as front-heavy as traditional teardrop aviators.</p>"
water purification tablets,"<h2>Types of water purification tablets</h2><p>For purification, three types of chemicals are used. They are based on iodine, chlorine, or chlorine dioxide. Each uses a unique chemical process to purify water, with varying degrees of success for each type of microorganism. To best suit your purification strategy, become acquainted with the various types of purification chemicals.</p><h3>Iodine-Based (Tetraglycine Hydroperiodide)</h3><p>Iodine, which comes as a solution, crystal, or tablet is a chemical compound commonly used for water purification and is especially effective in the eradication of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites. For water to be completely purified, it needs to sit for at least 30 minutes after the chemical has been added.</p><p>The temperature of the water to be purified has a very important effect on the effectiveness of iodine as a purifier. Generally, it takes a longer time to purify cooler water than it does to purify warmer water. Also, the quality of the water also influences the amount of iodine needed. Cloudy water generally requires more iodine than clear water. If the water contains visible particles, be sure to strain the water before adding iodine.</p><h3>Chlorine-Based Tablets (Sodium dichloroisocyanurate)</h3><p>The process of using chlorine as a means of purification it is referred to as chlorination. Discovered over a century ago, chlorine is especially effective in eliminating bacteria and viruses that cause diseases such as dysentery, typhoid, gastroenteritis, and cholera.</p><p>Chlorine disinfects water by first destroying the cell membrane of microorganisms which allows it to then enter and disrupt the cell s respiration and DNA activity. By combining it with effervescent salts such as sodium bicarbonate and adipic acid, these rapidly dissolving tablets become highly effective at eliminating a wide range of bacteria and viruses. Chlorine is considered to be ineffective against eliminating Cryptosporidium due to its protective shell and partially effective against Giardia.</p><p>Chlorine-based tablets are generally considered to be superior to its liquid form due to the additional effervescent salts which increase effectiveness and also because the liquid version tends to degrade with age. To use chlorine as a purifier, simply add the chlorine-based tablets to the appropriate amount of water and allow to stand in a closed container for about 30 minutes. To guarantee its effectiveness against Giardia, allow it to sit for at least 45 minutes.</p><h3>Chlorine Dioxide-Based Tablets</h3><p>This is probably the most powerful purification tablet currently available and is used to kill a wider range of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, and parasites such as cryptosporidium and giardia lambria. These tablets have fewer side effects than iodine and chlorine tablets and do not alter the taste of the water once purification is complete.</p><p>Chlorine dioxide tablets are especially effective against Giardia and Cryptosporidium as compared to iodine and chlorine tablets, however, for effective purification, water requires at least 4 hours to fully purify.</p><p>This chemical works via oxidation. The chemical infiltrates the microorganisms cell membrane and destroys the cytoplasm of the microorganism by responding with powerful amino acids. While the protective shells of Cryptosporidium and Giardia are somewhat resistant to iodine and chlorine, they are less protective against chlorine dioxide.</p><p>Chlorine dioxide tablets are only activated when contacted with water or moisture. If kept in a dry, airtight container, they can be stored for 4 years from the manufacturing date.</p>"
tactical wallets,"<h2>Types of tactical wallets</h2><p>Tactical wallets come in a variety of sizes and designs. Some are meant for specific uses, like law enforcement or the military. Others are more versatile and can be used for multiple purposes. The size of the wallet is another consideration. Small tactical wallets are easier to conceal than larger ones. However, they're also harder to carry around because they don't hold as much cash or credit cards. Larger tactical wallets hold more cash or credit cards, making them easier to carry around. They're also easier to conceal when you keep them in your vehicle. If you plan on using a tactical wallet for multiple purposes, it's worth considering getting one that can accommodate more cash or credit cards. That way, you'll have options for all your needs.</p><h3>Law enforcement</h3><p>Law enforcement tactical wallets are designed specifically for law enforcement use. They're small enough to fit inside a pocket but large enough to hold cash or credit cards. These wallets are made with thick plastic so they don't break easily. The plastic is reinforced with aluminum to prevent rips or tears. The wallet itself is made from nylon fabric to prevent snags or abrasions. The wallet includes a flap that can be folded over to conceal contents. This feature makes it easier to conceal when you keep the wallet in your vehicle. Law enforcement tactical wallets are usually black or gray to make them easier to spot if you're driving through a neighborhood at night. The design is meant to be unobtrusive so you can focus on what matters most. The wallet includes a pocket for holding cash or credit cards, which makes it easier to pay for things. It's important to note that these wallets aren't waterproof. If you plan on keeping them in your vehicle, it's worth considering getting a waterproof tactical wallet. Otherwise, you'll need to pay extra for a water-resistant option.</p><h3>Bifold pocket</h3><p>stands as the best-built, best-balanced product. Frequent praise for its robust construction and admirable craftsmanship.</p><h3>Tactical minimalist wallet</h3><p>Both tactical and minimal, but more importantly, it delivers reliable protection to miserly consumers at an excellent price point.</p><h3>Multitool</h3><p>Superbly functional take on run-of-the-mill EDC wallets. It takes the standard design of two steel plates wedged together and spices it up with an arsenal of downsized tools, including a pry tool, bolt wrenches, and the almighty bottle opener.</p><h3>Tactical bifold wallet</h3><p>Perfect solution for those into added functionality yet think the metal wallets are still not quite for them. It sheds hardened frames and casings for a nylon material.</p><h3>Tactical wallet</h3><p>Stainless steel and machined aluminum fastened together with top-notch workmanship, resulting in near-flawless build quality.</p><h3>Money clip</h3><p>The primary storage method is a single money clip, which can hold quite a lot, but it leaves your valuables open and exposed.</p>"
military socks,"<h2>Types of military socks</h2><p>Military and public service jobs are often very tough on your feet. Without proper footwear, painful blisters on toes and heels can be outright debilitating. While choosing the right military boots usually gets the most attention, sock selection is equally as important. Blisters are caused by friction and heat on the skin, so the socks you choose will be your first line of defense.</p><h3>Combat Boot Socks</h3><p>The Combat Boot Socks are made to be suitable for any kind of terrain and climate. One common characteristic is that these socks would extend over the calf, which is meant to give extra protection.</p><h3>Desert Boot Socks</h3><p>The Desert Boot Socks are tailored for hot weather conditions. It's one of the top picks if you are going to the desert.</p><h3>Military Boot Socks</h3><p>The abbreviation for Military Boot Socks is widely known as MB. It usually has mid-calf length.</p><h3>Anti-Fatigue Boot Socks</h3><p>Typically, anti-fatigue boot socks will be over-the-calf socks so that they can offer extra leg support.</p><p>If you are constantly involved in long hours of field operation, the anti-fatigue socks will come in handy. They are capable of giving your feet the support you need for you to be able to stay on your feet for long hours.</p><h3>Physical Training Socks</h3><p>Physical Training Socks are widely known as MT. Usually, this type of socks would have crew-length. They are built to be durable so that they can withstand physical abuse.</p>"
camping coffee makers,"<h2>Types of camping coffee makers</h2><p>There are a lot of choices when it comes to camping coffee makers, and the trick is to make sure what you want fits the type of camping you plan on doing.</p><p>While there are numerous types of coffee makers, there are four broad categories: those that brew via pressure, those that allow the grounds to steep, those that brew via drip, and, finally, those that brew by boiling.</p><h3>Pressure brew</h3><p>This kind of coffee maker extracts the coffee goodness by forcing boiling/hot water through it via high pressure. To make a full cup of coffee, you typically have to add additional water after it's brewed. These are less common and tend to be a little more expensive for camping simply because of the need for perfect seals and high-pressure mechanisms.</p><h3>Steep brew</h3><p>A steep brew is one of the most simple, yet effective, methods of brewing up your coffee. All you need is a pot to add your hot water to the grounds; let it steep for three to five minutes, depending on taste; and then use something to push out the grounds and leave behind just the coffee.</p><p>There are other steep brew coffee makers out there, including coffee in tea bags, and the siphon-style that does a cool little magic trick by heating the water in a lower vessel, which is connected to a higher vessel via a tube of some kind. When the water gets to the boiling point, pressure forces the water into the upper chamber where the coffee grounds are. You then remove the heat source, and as the coffee cools, it slowly trickles down through a special filter back into the lower chamber. It's not too complicated, but awkward enough that you probably don't want to take it camping.</p><h3>Drip brew</h3><p>Dependable coffee makers and the trusty percolator coffee maker, fall into the drip brew category. This is a fundamentally simple type of coffee maker and is capable of making a lot of coffee at once. Water is boiled, then rises (in the case of a percolator) into where the grounds are stored, where it continues to boil until the heat is removed and the coffee drains through a filter to leave behind the grinds (and some oils if you're using a paper filter).</p><p>This simplicity of design makes percolators great coffee makers for camping, although the larger ones are likely too bulky and heavy for backpacking into more remote areas.</p><h3>Boiling brew</h3><p>This is the most basic way to make coffee, and the most common example is often called ""cowboy coffee"". While there are some ways of making the most of this, you're just boiling water with coffee grounds in it. After a few minutes, the grounds will be floating on a layer at the top, so sprinkle some cold water on top to make it sink. Then just pour carefully for a stout, slightly crunch cup of joe.</p>"
life jackets,"<h2>Types of life jackets</h2><p>Life jackets come in many different sizes and designs. The most important thing to consider is how you plan on using the life jacket. If you're a recreational boater, you can get away with a small, basic one. But if you plan on taking your boat out into rough waters or fishing off-shore, you'll need something more substantial.</p><p>There are different life jackets for different boating activities. Below is a brief description of each type of life jacket, their intended use, and the buoyancy they provide.</p><h3>Type I - Inherently buoyant</h3><p>Recommended uses and features:</p><ul><li>Intended Use: When cruising, racing, and fishing offshore, or when boating alone, or in stormy conditions.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy:22 lbs. for adults. (11 lbs. for child size)</li><li>Additional Information: Best for open, rough, or remote water where rescue may be slow to arrive. Will turn MOST unconscious wearers face-up in water.</li></ul><p>Offers the best protection, but is somewhat bulky and uncomfortable. Does the best job of retaining body heat, as it has additional foam and fabric, and keeps your head higher above water.</p><p>Currently, there aren't any Coast Guard-approved Type I inflatable PFDs available to the general public.</p><h3>Type II - Inherently buoyant</h3><p>Recommended uses and features:</p><ul><li>Intended Use: Inland day cruising, fishing, and sailing. Good for boating in the light craft.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy:15.5 lbs. for adult size.</li><li>Additional Information: Good for protected, inland water near shore, where chances of immediate rescue are good. Not suitable for extended survival in rough water. Will turn SOME unconscious wearers face-up in water. Poor performer in rough water often requires you to tread water to keep your head above water.</li></ul><p>More comfortable but less buoyant than Type I. Provides far less flotation than a Type I.</p><h3>Type II - Inflatable</h3><p>Recommended uses and features:</p><ul><li>Intended Use: For serious inland and near-shore cruising.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy:34 lbs. for adult size.</li><li>Additional Information: Not guaranteed to turn unconscious wearer face-up.</li><li>Advantages: very comfortable, more buoyant than Type II Inherently Buoyant jackets.</li><li>Disadvantages: High price; may be manual or automatic.</li></ul><p>There are many Type V (special use) inflatable jackets that provide Type II performance characteristics.</p><p>Inflatable PFDs are not meant for children under the age of 16.</p><h3>Type III - Inherently buoyant</h3><p>Recommended uses and features:</p><ul><li>Intended Use: Supervised activities, such as sailing regattas, dinghy races, water skiing, fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and during personal watercraft operation.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy: 15.5 lbs. for adult size.</li><li>Additional Information: Good for protected, inland water near shore, where the chance of immediate rescue is good. Not suitable for extended survival in rough water. Not designed to turn unconscious people face up in the water.</li></ul><p>More comfortable to wear than a Type I or a Type II, but provides far less floatation than a Type I.</p><h3>Type III - Inflatable</h3><p>Recommended uses and features:</p><ul><li>Intended Use: For boating inshore and near shore and for supervised activities such as sailing regattas, dinghy races, and canoeing.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy:22.5 lbs. for adult size.</li><li>Additional Information: Not guaranteed to turn unconscious wearer face-up.</li><li>Advantages: more comfortable than a Type III Inherently Buoyant jacket.</li><li>Disadvantages: one manual inflation mechanism only.</li></ul><p>Inflatable PFDs are not meant for children under the age of 16.</p><h3>Type IV - Throwable Device</h3><ul><li>Intended Use: Type IV is designed to be thrown to an overboard victim or to supplement the buoyancy of a person overboard. It is not to be worn. Minimum buoyancy: 16.5 lbs. for ring buoy or 18 lbs. for boat cushion.</li><li>Additional Information: A Type IV throwable device can be a square style, a ring buoy, or a horseshoe buoy mounted on deck.</li></ul><p>A Type IV is not for unconscious persons, non-swimmers, or children. Although these devices are often referred to as seat cushions, you should never use them as such. This degrades the foam and reduces the amount of floatation that is provided.</p><p>Note: Type IV devices must be IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE for use. You must have one at arm's length to throw over the side in an emergency. Having one in a locker under the driver's seat isn't considered """"immediately available.""""</p><h3>Type V - Special use life jackets</h3><ul><li>Intended Use: Restricted to the special use for which each is designed, for example, sailboard harness, deck suit, paddling vest, commercial white water vest, or float coats.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy:15.5 to 22 lbs. for adult size.</li><li>Additional Information: Must be worn when underway to meet minimum US Coast Guard requirements. Simply having a Type V PFD on board will not meet the USCG carriage requirements.</li></ul><h3>Type V - Automatic inflation models</h3><ul><li>Intended Use: Restricted to the one use for which it is designed, ex. belt pack, deck suit, float coat.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy: 22.5 to 34 lbs. depending on style.</li><li>Additional Information: Must be worn to meet federal requirements.</li></ul><p>Not guaranteed to turn an unconscious wearer face-up. Some manufacturers claim Type II performance. Some models feature a combination of CO2 inflation and built-in foam and provide 15.5 to 22 lbs. of buoyancy.</p><h3>Type V - Hybrid Inflation</h3><p>Some special notes:</p><ul><li>Intended Use: Models recommended for boating activities where rescue is nearby and must be worn when underway.</li><li>Minimum Buoyancy: Have 7.5 lbs. of built-in foam buoyancy and can be inflated to 22 lbs.</li><li>Additional Information: More comfortable to wear than Type I or Type II, but are inadequate for unconscious overboard victims.</li><li>Inflation Mechanism: When activated, a CO2 cartridge is pierced, releasing gas to inflate the device. Water-activated models inflate automatically when submerged in water.</li></ul><p>Manual units are activated by yanking a pull tab. Both types of inflatables feature blow-tubes to provide a backup method of inflation. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for checking and maintaining your inflation mechanism.</p>"
survival backpacks,"<h2>Types of survival backpacks</h2><p>Survival backpacks are designed for emergency preparedness. They need to be lightweight, durable, and compact enough to fit inside a vehicle or backpack. A true survival backpack includes plenty of features found on other packs, but their quality matters more than most. Additionally, how a specific collection of features comes together can determine a pack's suitability for emergency survival.</p><p>That said, survival packs, like bug-out bags, can be classified according to their intended emergency setting: urban, wilderness, and tactical.</p><h3>Urban</h3><p>As the name implies, urban survival packs look right at home in a metropolitan or suburban setting with repurposed school and EDC bags filling the role well.</p><h3>Wilderness</h3><p>wilderness backpacks tend to be tougher, lighter, and more technical in their design and features; hiking and hunting backpacks fill this role most often.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tactical or military survival packs are heavier-duty and heavier than wild survival bags and have lots of PALS webbing to accommodate extra gear.</p>"
survival gifts,"<h2>Types of survival kits</h2><p>Survival kits are designed for different purposes. Some are meant to be used as a standalone item, while others are intended to be part of a larger kit. The key is knowing which type you need and finding the right one. Here's a breakdown of the most common options.</p><h3>Emergency kits</h3><p>These kits are meant to be kept in your home or car at all times. They usually include basic supplies like flashlights, batteries, and water filters. Emergency kits are great for people who live in an area prone to natural disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes. They're also good for people who plan on being away from home for long periods, like those who travel frequently. Emergency kits are inexpensive because they're made with generic products. You can find them for under $10 online. That said, they're not ideal for people who plan on using them regularly. If you only plan on using the contents once every few years, then this is a great option. Otherwise, you'll have to pay more for what you want.</p><h3>Mini survival kits</h3><p>Mini survival kits or ""Altoids"" tin survival kits are small kits that contain a few basic survival tools. These kits often include a small compass, waterproof matches, minimum fishing tackle, a large plastic bag, a small candle, a jigsaw blade, a craft knife or scalpel blade, and/or a safety pin/s.</p><h3>Emergency kit</h3><p>The most common and the most used one is the emergency kit. Emergency kits are easily available as well and are used to aid a person in surviving for 72 hours during any rescue situation or in escaping from any natural disaster or any emergency including earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, floods, and so on. An emergency kit is also known as a disaster bag or quick run bag which is a small portable kit containing all the survival supplies essential for the survival of a person in the above-stated condition. It focuses on safely evacuating the person (surviving for 72 hours) instead of focusing on the person's long-term survival. The social movement by the individuals or group of individuals, where they specifically keep themselves prepared for natural disasters and emergencies such as those mentioned above and their effect on the political and economic structure of the society, is commonly known as survivalism. These emergency kits (also called personal emergency relocation kits) are quite commonly used in this subculture. If a disaster occurs, its main purpose is to evacuate the survivor as soon as possible. Therefore, it is quite helpful and necessary to carry this kit with you when you are traveling or staying in another place.</p><h3>Lifeboat survival kits</h3><p>The first one on the list is the lifeboat survival kit which is perfectly stowed in life rafts. These life rafts or lifeboats are rigid and firm. The lifeboat survival kits aim at providing the basic human survival supplies and tools which help passengers in surviving until they reach a rescue place or are rescued by someone. One lifeboat survival kit can be used by six people at one time since it includes more quantities of survival tools and supplies.</p><p>Lifeboat survival kits are stowed in inflatable or rigid lifeboats or life rafts. These kits provide basic survival tools and supplies to enable passengers to survive until they are rescued.</p><h3>Sporting survival kits</h3><p>These kits are geared toward sportsmen or outdoor enthusiasts. They often include items like fishing tackle, hunting gear, camping equipment, and survival knives. Sporting survival kits are great for people who plan on spending time outdoors, but they're not ideal for people who don't plan. These kits tend to be expensive because they're made with high-quality materials. It's worth it if you plan on using the contents, but you'll have to pay up to get what you want.</p>"
shooting gloves,"<h2>Types of shooting gloves</h2><p>Shooting gloves are designed for specific purposes. Some are meant to protect against water damage, while others are specifically made for use in cold-weather environments. Shooting gloves can be found in a variety of different materials, including cotton and wool, but the most popular option is leather. Leather is durable and easy to clean, making it a great choice for shooting gloves. It's also hypoallergenic, so if you have allergies, this is a good option. However, leather does scratch easily, so it isn't recommended for use with sharp objects. If you want to stick with leather, make sure to buy gloves that are not scratched or worn down. This will extend their lifespan.</p><p>Shooting gloves are categorized into three different types. There are lightweight, which are often specialized gloves; middleweight, which is well rounded; and heavyweight, which are meant for hard, specialized use. Each category has its distinct differences and uses.</p><h3>Lightweight</h3><p>These gloves are light. Though they are generally affordable, they are not necessarily cheaply made. Usually, these trade insulation and sometimes durability for dexterity, feel, and grip.</p><p>Consider these a specialty glove. A professional glove. Sleek and specialized. These gloves can sometimes hack it in the field but are not purpose-built to withstand harsh conditions.</p><h3>Middleweight</h3><p>Middleweight is usually where well-rounded gloves can be found. Unless you require carbon-fiber knuckle protection or extreme insulation, this is probably about as high in protection as you need to go. Your hands are well-protected against minor scrapes and bumps at this level, but do not go grabbing suppressors or expect to punch through the drywall. In this weight class, you might get some weather protection and insulation, but not enough for the arctic.</p><h3>Heavyweight</h3><p>These, like the lightweights, are specialized. They just exist on the other end of the spectrum and can be specialized in any number of ways. The tradeoff here is usually in the dexterity and feel categories.</p><p>These are for hard use and will protect your hands, whether from physical dangers or the elements. In this category, there's a wide range of gloves for a wide range of applications. While these may not be the best shooting gloves for flat range, these are usually the best shooting gloves for situations they were designed for.</p>"
water bottles,"<h2>Types of water bottles</h2><p>Water bottles are containers used to hold water, liquids, or other beverages for consumption. A water bottle lets an individual drink and transports a beverage from one place to another. A water bottle is usually made of plastic, metal, or glass. Water bottles come in different shapes, colors, and sizes. They can be either disposable or reusable.</p><p>Here are some of the most common types of water bottles, divided by material and other features.</p><h3>Single-Use Plastic</h3><p>Single-use, pre-filled plastic water bottles. In some countries with low-quality tap water, citizens also use bottled water for health reasons. The increase in the use of single-use personal plastic water bottles has contributed to the litter problem, so reusable plastic bottles are better for the planet.</p><h3>Reusable Plastic</h3><p>Plastic is perhaps the most popular material used for water bottles. It is lightweight, making plastic water bottles easily transportable. The biggest concern about plastic is its environmental impact. It is disposable, which means most people throw it away after its first use. However, there are more rigid types of plastics that can be reused. BPA, an endocrine-disrupting substance, is a biohazard in plastic bottles. BPA-free plastic should be chosen, especially for water bottles for kids. Multi-use water bottles can be made from polypropylene, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), or copolyester.</p><h3>Glass</h3><p>Glass is considered the healthiest choice of material for water bottles. It is a non-permeable and natural raw material. It is known for its purity so that it won't give water a weird taste or odor. It can also be recycled infinitely, making it better for the environment than hard-to-recycle materials. However, the biggest problem with glass is that it is fragile and must be handled with care as it can easily break. It is also heavy, which compromises its portability.</p><h3>Aluminum</h3><p>Aluminum water bottles are lighter than glass or stainless steel, making them ideal for those concerned about portability. One of the problems with aluminum is that it can leach into the liquid. There must be a liner on the bottle to have no direct contact between water and aluminum. The liner is typically made of resin. The resin liner must be BPA-free.</p><h3>Copper</h3><p>Copper is one of the trendiest water bottle materials. It is shiny and sleek, making it a popular choice for a stylish container. However, while copper water bottles may look great, water with a high level of copper can cause side effects such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. A proper liner between the copper and water must be used.</p><h3>Stainless Steel</h3><p>Stainless steel is another good option for the types of water bottles. It is heavy but shatter-resistant, unlike the more fragile glass. Stainless steel is also a food-grade material, meaning it doesn't add any flavor to water.</p><h3>Collapsible</h3><p>This water bottle is ideal for easy travel. When the bottle is empty, it can be folded, which makes it space-efficient. When choosing collapsible water bottles, they should be strong enough to withstand wear, mainly because of the folding.</p><h3>Filtered</h3><p>Filtered bottles are designed for outdoor adventures such as hiking and camping. They allow people to drink water from different sources. The built-in filtration system helps eliminate the contaminants present in the water to ensure it will be safe. The type of filter that it uses is an essential consideration. Carbon and ultraviolet filters are the most popular materials used.</p><h3>Insulated</h3><p>To keep water, or whatever liquid a bottle may contain, hot or cold for an extended period, insulated water bottles are needed. They are made of a unique material to keep the temperature of the water for hours.</p><h3>Bamboo</h3><p>An eco-friendly option for water bottles is bamboo. It is an organic and renewable material, making it user and planet-friendly. Today, bamboo is commonly used for commemorative water bottles, such as weddings and corporate giveaways, or customized with engraved names.</p><h3>Smart</h3><p>Water bottles equipped with smart functions are a newer technology. Smart water bottles have digital systems that can connect to smartphones or laptops. They have alarms and reminders that can give notifications when it's time to drink more water. These bottles make it easier to stay hydrated throughout the day. Aside from drinking reminders, some smart water bottles can also be connected to a compatible mobile application for more functions.</p>"
camping tables,"<h2>Types of camping tables</h2><p>There is no doubt that camping is becoming a more popular global trend. As the popularity of camping grows, many manufacturers concentrate on producing camping equipment and furniture. A camping table is one of the most important pieces of camping equipment. This guide will undoubtedly assist you if you are looking for a camping table and are unsure which type to select.</p><h3>Side Table</h3><p>Side tables are smaller than all other camping tables. These are specially designed to support and bear small items. Side tables may not be a good option for eating. However, they help support many other things, including drinks, lighting, bags, and smaller items. Unlike folding or other durable tables, side tables aren't the option for sitting and putting extra weight on them. Typically, the camping side table is folded compactly, working as a television dinner table. As they are waterproof or sturdy, camping side tables have high tensile strength.</p><h3>Folding Camping Table</h3><p>A folding table is perhaps the most common type of camping table in today's market. A folding camping table shrinks to a compact and flat shape. You can easily bend the legs of a folding table inwards and tuck them behind the surface. Most folding camping tables are designed with aluminum and other quality material. So, they can support a lot of weight during camping. A folding camping table can rise relatively high off the floor, depending on the structure. However, placing a folding camping table on a flat surface is advisable to help prevent tipping.</p><h3>Roll-up Table</h3><p>A roll-up camping table can help you in a variety of ways. For example, they help you hold or support drinks, utensils, bags, dishes, etc. They can bear weight from 50 lbs to 100 lbs. however, some are too small and can only bear up to 40 lbs. Depending on your conditions, you can choose the supporting level of the roll-up camping table. They are different in size and are made up of different materials.</p><h3>Tall Table</h3><p>If you are going camping with your family member, colleagues, and university friends, you need to have a pretty big table for camping. The big size camping table helps you organize more items on your table and provides more areas to socialize with each other during camping resting time. So, you need to know how many people will be the members or parts of your camping expedition. The number of campers will decide the size of the table.</p><h3>Low Table</h3><p>A low camping table is also a common type used by campers. Low tables have numerous benefits. For example, they allow campers to sit on the ground floor and easily access the table. In addition, they are not so high from the ground. If you use a low table, there is no need to carry chairs and sofas. You need to have a sitting mat or carpet. Place it on the ground to easily access the table and enjoy your camping time.</p>"
dry bags,"<h2>Types of dry bags</h2><p>The type of dry bag you require is determined by the purpose for which you intend to use it. If you need to protect your phones or cameras, a small waterproof pouch may be what you need.</p><p>A lightweight dry bag may be required for clothing and other medium-sized items. More information about the various types of dry bags that can be used for various purposes can be found below:</p><h3>Waterproof pouch</h3><p>Waterproof pouch is usually a see-through waterproof bag that is small enough to fit small items such as phones, gadgets, and small paper documents. It has a roll-top opening to make sure it is properly sealed.</p><h3>Lightweight dry bag</h3><p>Lightweight dry bag has the capacity from 1 liter up to 80 liters. Clothes, food, and/or electronics can be stored in this kind of dry bag. In addition, wet items can be separated from dry items using this bag.</p><h3>PVC dry bag</h3><p>If you need an ultimate strong dry bag, PVC dry bag is a good choice. It is made from PVC with welded seams and is quite heavy compared to the other types because of its toughness and density. It is usually used in extreme sports as it can withstand pressure and other force.</p><h3>Heavyweight dry bag</h3><p>Heavyweight dry bag can contain larger items or more medium-sized items. It has a capacity that ranges from 16 liters to 45 liters.</p><h3>Holdalls and rucksacks</h3><p>These kinds of dry bags are as tough as PVC dry bags with welded seams. They have a capacity from 35 to 70 liters.</p>"
chronograph watches,"<h2>Types of chronograph watches</h2><p>There are three main types of chronograph watches, and each has its place. The first is the basic watch with a chronograph function. They're easy to use and accurate enough for most people. However, they don't offer much in terms of features or design. If you want more from your watch, you'll need to move up to one of the other two options.</p><h3>Basic Chronograph Watch</h3><p>The basic chronograph watch is the simplest option. It's just a watch with a chronograph face on it. You can get these for as low as $50, so they're a great option for beginners. They're easy to use and accurate enough for most people. However, they don't offer many features or design options. If you want more from your watch, you'll need to move up to one of the other options.</p><h3>Digital Chronograph Watch</h3><p>The digital chronograph watch is the next step up from the basic watch. These are more expensive options that cost upwards of $300, but they're worth it if you have the money to spend. They're easy to use and accurate enough for most people. They offer features like date display and 24-hour time format, which is nice to have. They also offer a variety of different watch faces to choose from. If you want more from your watch, you'll need to move up to one of the other options.</p><h3>Analog Chronograph Watch</h3><p>The analog chronograph watch is the most advanced option. It's the most expensive option, but it's worth it if you have the money to spend.</p>"
body armor,"<h2>Types of body armor</h2><p>Body armor comes in a variety of different categories, and it's important to know which one you need before you buy. Body armor is designed for specific purposes, so it's important to pick the right kind for your needs.</p><h3>Body Armor Vest</h3><p>Also known as a bulletproof or ballistic vest, this is an item of body armor that helps absorb and reduce the impact on the torso from fragmentation from explosions and firearm-fired projectiles. This is usually worn by police officers, correctional officers, security guards, and some regular citizens. Depending on what you need protection from, there are different types of vests, for different levels of protection.</p><h3>Soft Armor Plates</h3><p>Soft armor plates are flexible and soft, but still extremely strong and protective. They are light and not bulky and are usually worn as a concealed body armor vest or plate carrier.</p><h3>Hard Armor Plates</h3><p>Hard body armor plates provide the highest level of protection possible but are not as comfortable or light as soft armor plates. They can be inserted into plate carriers or body armor vests.</p><h3>Concealed Vest</h3><p>Concealed body armor vests are designed to be worn under street clothes, or uniforms. Due to soft armor panels, they are designed not to be seen, but to provide full protection from bullet and stab threats. They protect the front, back, and sides of the torso.</p><h3>Full Body Tactical Armor</h3><p>The military usually wears full body armor. It consists of front, side, and back protection in a vest, which can be joined with armor that covers the majority of the body such as a helmet and protection for the arms and legs. This is intended to be worn on show above clothes, as opposed to the concealed vest.</p><h3>Bulletproof Military Plate Carrier</h3><p>Plate carriers are another type of bulletproof vest, but which are lighter and more comfortable than full-body armor vests. They can hold soft or hard armor plates to provide different levels of protection required. As they are lighter options yet still provide very strong protection, they are a popular choice for military and police services.</p><h3>Edge-Blade and Spike Protection</h3><p>Edge-blade refers to commercial knives that do not come to a fine point. Protection against this blade is against slashing or stabbing of such an instrument. Spike weapons refer to any harmful instrument that has a fine-pointed tip. This does not include shrapnel that is projected from an explosive. Spike weapons could refer to a syringe or anything that has a sharp-tipped edge.</p><p>Protection against stabbings may be slightly different from ballistic protection. The stab vest may have fibers woven tighter and more layers to prevent an edge-blade or spike from penetrating the skin.</p><h3>Multi Armor Threat</h3><p>Multi-threat armor protects against multiple different types of weapons and attacks. This type of armor is useful if someone is facing multiple threats or does not know what weapons their attackers may have. This type of armor is beneficial for people working in Law Enforcement, who are required to have complete protection against a wide variety of threats. The types of body armor could be to have stab-proof vests, which are also spike-proof at the same time.</p>"
camping knives,"<h2>Types of camping knives</h2><p>Camping knives come in many different forms and sizes. No matter what task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, it's probable that you'll easily find a camping knife that suits your needs.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>A fixed blade is any knife with a blade that is fixed in place, meaning that it doesn't have a pivot, and is firmly, immovably attached to the handle. They're essentially the opposite of pocket knives. The blade is always exposed unless it's covered by a sheath. They're simple, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly due to the absence of a confusing locking mechanism.</p><p>Fixed blade camping knives come in many varieties, including drop-point and clip-point knives. The better-designed fixed blades are also full-tang, where the part of the blade that's part of the handle is the same size and shape as the handle, as this provides the greatest overall strength. The majority of cheap camping fixed blades, unfortunately, are not; these knives have a thin metal tail that is typically pinned or glued inside of the handle and are more prone to breaking.</p><h3>Folding</h3><p>Also referred to as a pocket knife, a folder is a compact knife that features one or more blades that fold up into the handle, instead of using a bulky sheath. Meant to fit easily inside your pocket, these knives are legal to carry in most places, and are convenient to carry and use daily. They are frequently smaller than fixed blades, with blades typically between three and four inches long, although many exceptions are both longer and shorter than this. While these aren't common choices for camping knives, they can be quite handy for anything from peeling an apple to cutting rope. Though these folding knives are typically smaller and not as strong as their fixed blade siblings, they're highly versatile.</p><h3>Multitool</h3><p>While technically a variant of a folding knife, the main selling point of a multitool isn't the blade itself, but rather the multiple tools that accompany it. This can include anything from pliers or scissors to screwdrivers and corkscrews.</p>"
gas masks,"<h2>Types of gas masks</h2><p> even though gas masks are a subtype of respirator, words and their definitions change. The full-face respirator is commonly known and referred to as a gas mask by laymen, preppers, and survivalists, whereas a respirator is a filter that only covers the nose and mouth and offers partial face protection.</p><p>Gas Mask</p><ul><li>Protection: Full-face, or full head protection.</li><li>Filter: All hazardous materials depending on the type of filter installed.</li><li>Size and weight: Bulkier, some types have additional components like a separate air supply. Can be heavy due to additional components, filters, and a portable air supply.</li><li>Cost: Expensive.</li></ul><h3>Elastomeric Full-Facepiece Respirator (Gas Mask)</h3><p>This is similar to the half-facepiece respirator but covers the whole face. It protects against particles, gases, and vapors depending on the type of cartridge or filter installed. There are different makes and models out in the market. This is what preppers generally refer to as a gas mask.</p><h3>Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs)</h3><p>This type of respirator covers the whole head up to the shoulders. It has a battery-powered blower that pulls air through an attached filter, canister, or cartridges. It protects against particles, gases, and vapors when equipped with the appropriate filters. It is loose fitting and can be used with facial hair.</p><h3>Supplied Air Respirators (SAR)</h3><p>SAR are full face masks that are connected to a hose that supplies clean compressed air from a separate source. The mask has a one-way valve to release exhaled air. This equipment is lightweight and is used while working for extended periods in environments that are not immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).</p><h3>Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA)</h3><p>SCBA is used for entry into or escapes from the IDLH environment. It comes with a portable oxygen supply, and can either be an open-circuit (OC-SCBA), or a closed-circuit system (CC-SCBA).</p><p>OC-SCBA provides air via a high-pressure tank and the exhaust exhaled air into the atmosphere. CC-SCBA on the other hand recirculates the exhaled air after the CO2 was filtered out, leaving only the oxygen. This rebreathing mechanism extends its operational time.</p><p>The Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus or SCUBA is a form of SCBA. However, the regular SCBA is not rated for underwater use.</p><h3>Combination Respirators</h3><p>There are 2 types of combinations used: Supplied Air Respirator + SCBA, and Supplied Air Respirator + PAPRs. The SAR + SCBA has a self-contained air supply if the primary air supply fails. It can be used in an IDLH environment. The SAR + PAPR on the other hand cannot be used in an IDLH due to its non-existent backup air supply.</p>"
hiking daypacks,"<h2>Types of hiking daypacks</h2><p>There are the types of hiking daypacks that you need to know before making a purchase.</p><h3>General Daypacks</h3><p>General daypacks, which are the most popular daypack, work well for most of life's mundane tasks. They are fairly inexpensive, ideal for campus life, and work well for bike commuting and general travel. In short, they are excellent bags for ""around town"" and ""around the city"" use. The multitude of pockets allows for excellent organization, and the large capacities make it easy to bring everything but the kitchen sink when the need arises.</p><h3>Technical Daypacks</h3><p>Recognizing general daypacks weren't ideal for serious day hiking trips, manufacturers created smaller capacity packs with the same features found in full-size backpacks. While these smaller ability packs are still called ""daypacks"", these packs are also known as ""technical daypacks"", since they share the common technical features found in larger backpacks.</p>"
survival lighter,"<h2>Types of survival lighters</h2><p>Survival lighters come in all different sizes, shapes, and prices. There's a good chance you can find one that fits your budget, but it's important to know what you're getting into before you pull the trigger.</p><h3>Traditional survival lighters</h3><p>These are the most common type of survival lighters on the market today. They are made from metal or aluminum, have a long-lasting flame, and weigh less than an apple. The downside is that they aren't very efficient at burning fuel, so you'll need to refill more often. Also, they don't last as long as other options because they are made from cheap metals. If you want something reliable for survival use, this is the way to go.</p><h3>Gas-fueled survival lighters</h3><p>This is another option worth considering. Gas-fueled survival lighters are popular because they burn fuel quickly and last longer than traditional options. However, they are also more expensive. Gas is expensive, so you'll need to plan when you buy one. Also, they are heavier than traditional options, so you'll need to make sure you can comfortably carry them around. Gas-fueled survival lighters are great for camping trips or emergency kits, but they aren't ideal for survival use. Gas is flammable, so you'll need to be careful with these lighters.</p>"
rolling backpacks,"<h2>Types of rolling backpacks</h2><p>Rolling backpacks are designed for specific uses. Some are meant to carry a sleeping bag, tent, or other camping gear. Others are built for hiking packs or skis. Still, others are built for motorcycles. The list goes on and on. There's a reason for each design choice. Rolling backpacks are made from durable materials that can withstand wear and tear. They're also compact enough to fit in the bottom of a pack without adding weight. These features make them ideal for carrying camping equipment or skiing supplies. However, they aren't built to withstand harsh weather conditions like rain or snow. If you plan to use your rolling backpack in cold climates, it's best to buy one with an additional pocket or strap for extra protection against water damage.</p><h3>Sleeping backpacks</h3><p>These are the most popular rolling backpacks because they're specifically designed for camping trips. Sleeping backpacks are larger than typical rolling backpacks so they can accommodate more gear. Sleeping backpacks have two straps so you can secure them to your pack frame. This allows you to roll them up without worrying about damaging them. Sleeping backpacks are usually made from ripstop nylon so they can withstand wear and tear. The downside is that these bags don't offer much protection against water damage. If you plan to use your sleeping backpack in cold climates, it's best to buy one with an additional pocket or strap for extra protection against water damage.</p><h3>Hiking backpacks</h3><p>These are the least common rolling backpacks because they're built for hiking packs. Hiking backpacks are larger than sleeping backpacks so they can accommodate more gear. Hiking backpacks are usually made from ripstop nylon so they can withstand wear and tear. The downside is that these bags don't offer much protection against water damage.</p>"
freeze dried food,"<h2>Types of freeze-dried foods</h2><p>You might want something specific from your food depending on what you're up to. When preparing for a disaster, you should prioritize sheer volume. If you're going hunting, fishing, or camping for a week, you can afford to plan each meal separately. If you're planning for long-term survival and need to consider morale, a birthday treat or two wouldn't hurt.Here are the different kinds of freeze-dried food.</p><h3>Bulk survival meals</h3><p>Buying in bulk is a fantastic way to save money, and prepping your food supply is no different. Freeze drying food is an expensive process and it can hit your wallet hard if you don't shop carefully. If you do a lot of short trips, buying in bulk can still save money since there's no rush to eat all of it.</p><p>Bulk survival meals typically come in some kind of waterproof container and are separated into individual or family-sized meals. We recommend choosing a kit that includes a variety of food to keep mealtime from getting too monotonous. One kit might include as many as 60 servings and have a shelf life measured in decades.</p><h3>Single-serve meals</h3><p>For short, infrequent trips, buying meals individually is the way to go. You'll appreciate being able to pick each meal and account for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This is also the easiest way to satisfy the individual tastes of everybody in a group.</p><p>Single-serve meals are also the best way to branch out and try something new. Even though they cost more than buying in bulk, it might be smart to try something and make sure you like it before loading up on a huge supply of the stuff. Go ahead and sample different brands and different menu items to see what you prefer.</p><h3>Novelty items</h3><p>We are human beings who only live once and might occasionally want to brighten our day with something fun.</p><p>Freeze-dried fruit and desserts can do wonders for lifting spirits in a survival situation. Besides, you'd be lying if you said you've never haggled for a slice of that coveted MRE marble pound cake. Things like freeze-dried ice cream are downright delicious, and you'd be doing yourself a favor to include some in your survival kit - for bartering purposes, of course.</p>"
camping canopy,"<h2>Types of camping canopies</h2><p>There are many different types of camping canopies available, ranging from simple tarps to large event spaces and everything in between.</p><h3>Tarps</h3><p>The simplest type of canopy tent is the tarp. Tarps come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and thicknesses and can be excellent options for creating custom shelters against the wind, rain, and sun.</p><p>The best camping canopies for backpackers and minimalists are tarps.</p><h3>Framed Canopies</h3><p>Any canopy tent with a metal """"skeleton"""" is a framed canopy. Framed canopies are best used when there aren't any trees around to string up a tarp, like at the beach or in the desert. Framed canopies can have an instant setup (like the pop-up canopies below) or be more durable multi-day structures.</p><h3>Pop-Up Canopies</h3><p>A pop-up canopy tent is a type of framed canopy that is specifically designed to have a quick setup. Often, a pop-up canopy tent will be made of lightweight materials like aluminum or fiberglass. Pop-up canopy tents are easy to transport and great for a family camping trip or a fair-weather event.</p><h3>Screen House Canopies</h3><p>A screen canopy is a type of canopy tent with mesh walls. These are designed for camping trips with lots of bugs. Many mesh canopy tents have removable floors and fit over a standard-size picnic table.</p>"
handheld gps,"<h2>Types of handheld GPS receivers</h2><p>Handheld GPS receivers are designed for a specific type of use. The most common types include sports, hiking, and car navigation. Each category has its own unique set of features. We'll take a look at the differences between each type to help you make an informed decision on which one is right for you.</p><h3>Sport Handheld GPS</h3><p>Sport handheld GPS receivers are designed for outdoor activities like running, biking, skiing, or snowmobiling. They're waterproof, rugged, and easy to use. Sport GPS receivers are affordable, making them a great choice for beginners looking to get into the world of GPS. However, they lack features like map overlays, weather alerts, and turn-by-turn voice prompts. If you plan on using your handheld GPS receiver in a sport setting, we recommend getting something with more robust hardware. Sport GPS receivers are also limited to 1GB of internal memory, so if you plan on storing large amounts of data, you'll need to look elsewhere.</p><h3>Hiking Handheld GPS</h3><p>Hiking handheld GPS receivers are designed for people who want to hike the Appalachian Trail or the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim Trail. These devices are rugged enough to withstand harsh environments and have plenty of storage capacity to hold maps, waypoints, and other important information. Hiking GPS receivers are also easy to use because they don't require any training to operate. You can start using it immediately after purchase. Hiking GPS receivers are affordable, making them a good choice for beginners looking to get into the world of GPS.

survival watch,"<h2>Types of survival watches</h2><p>Survival watches are designed for different purposes. There are also watches that can be used in specific environments. For example, a watch designed for use in the wilderness is not suitable for use in an urban environment. The same goes for watches designed for use in cold weather. These are not ideal for hot summer days. You get the idea. It's important to know what you're getting into before making a purchase.</p><p>Not all survival situations are the same, and it should come as no surprise that the gear they require is just as diverse. When you pick out a survival watch for your survival kit or part of your everyday carry, prioritize the features that matter most to you to get the most bang for your buck.</p><p>The majority of survival watches fall into one of three categories - analog, digital, and smart. Each of these styles is priced very differently and will possess a different range of features, so you should become familiar with each type of survival watches.</p><h3>Analog watches</h3><p>The analog watch face is timeless and never goes out of style. It can also be found on most of the survival watches on the market, thanks to its simplicity and enduring appeal. There are designs to satisfy anyone's personal style, and there's a nice variety on this list. Old-school analog watches are stone-simple and inexpensive, while premium options combine analog hands with digital screens to give you the best of both worlds.</p><p>Analog watches can keep up with digital watches in most aspects, but they do have some inherent limitations as a result of having physical hands. That's not a bad thing, it's just something to consider.</p><h3>Digital watches</h3><p>Digital watches offer certain features that purely analog watches just can't. Take advantage of things like 24-hour time, stopwatches, lap timers, multiple alarm clocks, and the ability to flip through information to get what you need, when you need it without cluttering up the small watch face with everything at once.</p><p>All this digital power needs a battery to run, so it's not a bad idea to keep a fresh battery around to give yourself a backup in case of an emergency. Personal preference plays a part in watch selection, too, and some people feel strongly about the choice between digital and analog. Both are viable options, so go with the one that feels right to you.</p><h3>Smart watches</h3><p>One of the strategies embraced by all survivalists is conserving weight and space. Since you'll likely need to carry everything and travel by foot in a survival situation, everything you bring needs to earn its keep. One way to pack a huge amount of power into a small item is with a smartwatch. By combining timekeeping with GPS navigation, health monitoring, and weather instruments, these advanced watches are one of the best assets you can have.</p><p>Keep in mind that this much computing power requires a lot of electricity compared to a traditional watch, so battery life is limited. Solar charging can extend lifespan, but you'll still want to keep an eye on that charge meter.</p>"
american made pocket knives,"<h2>Types of pocket knives</h2><p>There are three main types of pocket knives. Each type of pocket knife offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your pocket knife, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type to best fit your needs.</p><h3>Camper</h3><p>The camper pocket knife is also known as the multitool pocket knife. This type of pocket knife is well equipped with a number of different tools, including screwdrivers, can/bottle openers, scissors, pliers, nail files, toothpicks, tweezers, and more. This is by far the most versatile type of pocket knife, especially if you plan on using your pocket knife for several different purposes. Camper pocket knives are available in a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, colors, and price points. If you do decide to purchase a camper knife, make sure that the blade is strong enough and durable enough to fit your individual preferences.</p><h3>Canoe</h3><p>The canoe pocket knife is named after its canoe shape when it is closed. This type of pocket knife includes two blades of different shapes or sizes. The blades collapse on opposite ends, but on the same side of the knife handle. It typically carries both a pen blade and a drop point blade. The pen blade features a thin narrow blade, while the drop point blade has a straight spine until the very tip of the blade. Canoe pocket knives are generally safe to use, and they can safely fit in your pocket for everyday use or for use while on outdoor trips.</p><h3>Pen</h3><p>Pen pocket knives are one of the oldest types of knives. This type of pocket knife was named after the type of pen that needs to be dipped into a container of ink, typically a quill pen. The pen knife includes a thin, narrow blade with a sleek tip that closely resembled the famous ink and quill combination pen. This type of pocket knife is extremely comfortable, but it can be slightly larger than some of the other types of pocket knives. It is available to purchase in a variety of different price options, depending on the construction quality and design.</p>"
camping blankets,"<h2>Types of camping blankets</h2><p>Here is some basic information on the various types of camping blankets to help you get one step closer to finding the perfect one for your next camping trip.</p><h3>Sleeping bags</h3><p>Sleeping bags are the most commonly used camping amenities, almost anywhere. They are easy to access and purchase. They are also the most reliable and safe route to go, especially since camping involves sleeping outdoors. Sleeping bags are especially recommended during cold or chilly weather. They are incredibly suitable as they often give you all you need for a good night sleep, in one sleeping bag.<br /><br />So why are sleeping bags the true standard of camping blankets? The zippers are the main reason why sleeping bags are so common. Sleeping bag zippers completely cover you, meaning that they keep you safe from not only the cold, but pests and insects, too.</p><h3>Wool blankets</h3><p>Wool blankets are a viable option, especially if you are camping in an area with chilly weather. Wool blankets are also some of the most commonly used outdoor blankets on the market. They're so durable that even the military uses them on missions. Because they're so thick, these blankets cover you completely and keep you incredibly warm from during even cold storms. Wool blankets' main selling point is how warm they are, but their biggest drawback can is their itchiness. Unless you're buying incredibly high-quality wool, often times these blankets can leave you feeling warm, but incredibly uncomfortable.</p><h3>Puffy down blankets</h3><p>The puffy down blanket is actually incredibly similar to a sleeping bag and can be considered a replacement in the right circumstance. The puffy blanket does not need a lot of packing space and it typically provides a decent thermal rating. Puffy packable blankets are suitable not only for camping but also for a hiking, picnic use and any other outdoor activities. This type of camping blanket is long-lasting, warm and quite comfy, giving you a similar experience to that of a sleeping bag. For people who are looking for a more versatile version of a sleeping bag, the puffy packable blanket is the most recommended camping blanket.</p><h3>Waterproof fleece blankets</h3><p>These blankets are also commonly used for camping, picnics and hiking. They're some of our most preferred blankets because they provide you with warmth, while also keeping you dry from a damp or wet campground during the night. The blankets are made using a waterproof polyester backing, and stitching them together with a soft polar fleece, making them nearly some of the most comfy and warm blankets on the market.</p><h3>Emergency blankets</h3><p>Emergency blankets are quite small, but maybe the most efficient; especially in a bind. While these blankets don't typically last long, they're necessary for anyone that's adventuring in cold wilderness. They are easy to carry, hardly require any packing space, and are incredibly light, making them the perfect option to keep you protected during any emergency that might happen during an outdoor activity.</p><h3>Thermal blankets</h3><p>Thermal blankets are like emergency blankets in terms of their use but are more durable and are better for multi-use. You can use thermal blankets more than once and they offer warmth especially when the conditions are quite extreme. Thermal blankets are, however, not as comfy as fleece or wool blankets.</p>"
backpacking tents,"<h2>Types of backpacking tents</h2><p>Backpacking tents come in different sizes and setup styles, with pros and cons for each variety. Aside from capacity, you'll have to choose between freestanding, semi-freestanding, and tarp tents. Here's a basic breakdown of how these types of tents are organized.</p><h3>Freestanding</h3><p>Freestanding tents can be set up to their full potential without being staked. They have a sturdy pole system and are usually dome-shaped. These shelters are spacious and good for camping on terrain where staking would be difficult. The pole system creates enough tension to hold the fly and tent body stable, and they are usually the most versatile type of tent.</p><h3>Semi-freestanding</h3><p>These have a separate pole system and can stand up on their own without being stake but you'll need to stake them for full stability and livable space. These tents come with a tent body, a rainfly, a pole system, and stakes. They must be fully staked out to function properly. Semi-freestanding tents provide an ideal combination of weight saving, space, and versatility.</p><h3>Tarp-tents</h3><p>Tarp tents cannot stand up on their own. They require trekking poles and stakes for structure. They are usually single-wall, which can increase the buildup of condensation. Unless you're going ultralight, tarp tents are typically not the best idea for new backpackers, as they can be finicky to set up and require strategic staking for maximum livable space and stability. These shelters are best for fast-and-light backcountry travel once you have the rest of your system dialed in and are looking to drop weight.</p>"
gun safes under 1000,"<h2>Types of gun safes</h2><p>Gun safes come in many different shapes and sizes. From gun cabinets to gun safes, there are a wide variety of gun safe options out there for you. There are different types of gun safes that exist today and what they're good for.</p><h3>Standard Gun Safe</h3><p>A standard gun safe is a great option for those who want to keep their gun safe and secure. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but typically they're quite large and heavy. This makes them difficult to transport, but they offer the highest level of security possible.</p><p>You can generally expect a gun safe to offer a fire rating, steel construction with a standard locking mechanism! These keep firearms upright, leaning up against the interior walls of the safe.</p><p>These types of safes are great as a multi-purpose solution, where you can not only keep your firearms but also valuables and more.</p><h3>Gun Cabinet</h3><p>Gun cabinets are similarly styled to your standard gun safe, however, they are for the most part made of thinner steel, and do not utilize a normal locking mechanism. Instead, they use key locks, or keypads to be able to access the cabinet.</p><p>There is a huge range of different gun cabinets, ranging from low-end cabinets to higher-end cabinets that offer a variety of features.</p><h3>Vehicle Gun Safes</h3><p>A gun safe that is designed to be mounted in a vehicle. These safes are typically small and compact, making them easy to transport and store when not in use. They're also generally more affordable than other gun safes on the market today.</p><p>Most vehicle gun safes utilize a standard key lock or combination lock to keep firearms secure. They're an affordable option for gun owners who want to keep their guns safe in a car or truck.</p><h3>Pistol Safes</h3><p>A gun safe designed to hold one or several pistols. They are generally smaller than standard gun safes and can be mounted on the wall, inside cabinets, etc. They often have solid steel construction with multiple locking points for added security.</p><h3>Diversion Safes</h3><p>A gun safe that is designed to look like an everyday item. For example, a book safe or a fake can of soup. These are great for those who want access to their gun fast and easy but don't have it out in the open.</p><p>These types of safes come with a wide range of features, from biometric locks to standard key locks. They are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit your needs.</p><h3>Wall Safes</h3><p>A gun safe is installed into the wall of a home. These safes are generally slimmer and more compact than standard gun safes, which makes them ideal for those who have limited storage space or need to be able to conceal their gun quick and easy.</p><p>Wall gun safes come with almost any lock type you can think of.</p>"
hunting gps,"<h2>Types of hunting GPSs</h2><p>When choosing your next GPS device, it's important to consider just what type of functions you need.</p><h3>Handheld</h3><p>The handheld hunting GPS device is definitely the most common and what most people think of when they start their product search. Though they are often similar in size and shape, handheld devices can differ greatly in their capabilities. Handheld devices can range from purely navigational tools to sophisticated satellite communication devices.</p><p>The handheld devices that are purely for navigational needs are still more than enough for the basic everyday hunter whose primary needs are to mark waypoints for key terrain features like waterholes, clearings with good fields of fire and natural choke points, or to mark signs of animal activity like bedding areas, antler rubs, and tracks.</p><h3>Watches</h3><p>GPS watches, in conjunction with smartwatches, are a growing trend and may be a good solution for someone looking to cut down the weight of their backpack. Most GPS watches are originally geared for fitness purposes, tracking running routes and keeping tabs on your vitals, but many have the ability to mark waypoints, which is primarily what a hunter needs.</p><p>When it comes to GPS watches, what you gain in portability and durability, you lose in versatility. Most GPS watches come with a small monochrome display, making them incapable of displaying detailed topographic maps like their handheld cousins. To combat this disadvantage, most GPS smartwatches can be synced to your smartphone or tablet that does contain detailed maps, so the GPS data can be transferred over and utilized accordingly.</p><h4>Apps</h4><p>An increasing number of hunters are opting simply to use their smartphones or tablets as their personal GPS system. A number of apps are available today that can provide accurate topographic maps, aerial imagery, and other key land details that can help hunters along the way. The downside of using an app is that you're often hamstrung by the availability of cellular service. If you know you're going to be hunting somewhere outside of cell service, it may be helpful to save maps and overlays to your mobile device before leaving cellular coverage. Data saved from most of these apps can be easily transferred to a handheld GPS device if you opted to use both systems.</p>"
tactical watches,"<h2>Types of tactical watches</h2><p>Tactical watches are designed for specific uses, so it's important to know what you're getting into. Here comes the role of tactical watches which are also known as military watches. These timepieces are usually scratch resistance and waterproof to stand up in different situations.</p><h3>General Purpose/Field Watches</h3><p>General purpose, often called field watches, are military watches designed for military and other similar personnel to use in the field. They're normally typified by their simplistic design and are durable, robust, and built to withstand a multitude of different environments and weather conditions. Many are water-resistant to a certain level and shock resistance. You'll often find that the standard tactical watches feature chronographs, barometers, and compasses. But some don't even feature those. It depends on your available budget.</p><h3>Pilot Watches</h3><p>Pilot watches were first introduced to personnel in aircraft, pilots especially, in the Second World War, to give them the ability to check the time quickly. As pilot watches were designed to be worn over airmen and women's jackets and uniforms, they tend to have a larger case diameter of 50mm or more. You'll often find that the design is very uncluttered, neat, and minimalist.</p><p>Modern pilot watches still follow this principle. Though they've been upgraded somewhat in the style department while maintaining sharp, angled watch hands, a slide rule, and easy-to-read dials.</p><h3>Dive Watches</h3><p>It'll come as no surprise that dive watches are made to be resistant to water, which is why this is the main feature you'll find in these kinds of watches. Although the majority you'll find right now feature 200 to 300-meters of water resistance, if you want to Scuba dive to deeper levels, you might need to consider one of the rarer pieces that allow you to dive even deeper. Of course, if you're only ever going to be skimming the surface or just below it, then you may be able to get away with just having a watch with 100-meters or less water resistance.</p><h3>Digital Tactical Watches</h3><p>Digital tactical watches tend to be military-style watches that are suitable not just for military personnel and special ops, but also for extreme sports enthusiasts and survivalists. These are usually the most tricked-out watches and feature a multitude of amazing meters and techs, such as altimeters, GPS systems, temperature gauges, and weather meters. As is the case with most above, they normally also are water-resistant and scratch-resistant.</p>"
tactical flashlights,"<h2>Types of tactical flashlights</h2><p>There are certain features that set our picks apart from the others on the market. There are several types of tactical flashlights, as well as certain characteristics that informed our choices. Below, we've broken those down to make them easier to understand.</p><h3>Standalone</h3><p>Standalone flashlights are the most normal of the tactical flashlights, being not much different than normal ones, except for the addition of tactical features like improved durability, brightness, strobe modes, or lens colors. These lights are often popular with law enforcement and EDC enthusiasts, as they offer a discreet way to carry a lot of light in a small package.</p><h3>Weapon-mounted lights</h3><p>As the name says, a weapon-mounted light attaches to a firearm. They're specifically designed to provide illumination of a possible target that you're aiming at, immediately before firing. This allows you to line up your sights, ensure your target is actually your target, and in some cases, induce a flinch response in an attacker by momentarily blinding them, giving you a window of opportunity. These lights are good for anyone who carries a firearm, especially in close quarters. Additionally, there are infrared weapon lights that are useful for aiding night vision devices in situations where there is no ambient light to be amplified.</p><h3>Headlamps</h3><p>A headlamp is, understandably, a tactical flashlight that goes on your head. These can either be mounted to a strap and wrapped around one's head, or they can be mounted directly to a helmet or other headgear by use of a clip, rail, or NVG bracket. These have the advantage of leaving your hands free to operate equipment, search for someone or something, or read a map.</p>"
backpacking meals,"<h2>Types of backpacking meals</h2><p>Heading for the wilds on a multi-day camping trip doesn't mean you need to go without tasty, nourishing food. Whether you're heading on a two-day adventure or a multi-week epic, fueling your body with the right stuff is crucial to the success of any backpacking trip.</p><p>This definitive guide to the best backpacking food will help you decide what to bring on your upcoming adventures.</p><h3>Canned Food</h3><p>If you're transitioning from drive-in camping to backpacking you might be tempted to take some of your campfire favorites. Canned food is really heavy since it contains a lot of water, plus then you have to pack out the empty cans.</p><h3>Fresh Food</h3><p>Fresh fruit, vegetables, and meat are tempting, but without access to refrigeration in the backcountry, they go bad quickly. Gourmet backpackers could try freezing ingredients at home, and then cooking them after they've thawed on the hike in. This method yields some delicious dinners but doesn't work past the first night unless you are backpacking in very cold temperatures. Plus fresh food also tends to be full of water and very heavy.</p><h3>Grocery Store Dry Goods</h3><p>With a bit of planning, it's easy to put together backpacking meals using shelf-stable foods you can find at the grocery store. These meals typically revolve around dried starches like noodles, rice, or quinoa.</p><h3>Home Dehydrated Meals</h3><p>If you are willing to put in a bit of work, you can dehydrate your backpacking meals at home using a home dehydrator or even your oven on low heat. The possibilities for home dehydrating are limitless, but it does take a bit of practice to get the recipes right and a lot of time to make and dehydrate the meals.</p><h3>Prepackaged Backpacking Meals</h3><p>There are tons of options out there for prepackaged backpacking meals. These meals are either freeze-dried or dehydrated to remove the water, make them more compact and ensure they don't go bad. To cook them you just add boiling water then let them sit for a few minutes.</p><p>Prepackaged backpacking meals are lightweight, fairly compact, and convenient, but they can be expensive.</p>"
hardshell jackets,"<h2>Types of hardshell jackets</h2><p>Hardshell jackets are designed for the mountains: they're highly windproof, waterproof, breathable, and durable. This is the outer layer you turn to for ultimate protection while backcountry and resort skiing, mountaineering, alpine climbing, and 4-season trekking.</p><p>Below we break down our top hardshell jackets, from minimalist models for those who want to move fast and light to burly jackets made to withstand the worst winter conditions.</p><h3>All-around</h3><p>The proven design is plenty tough to withstand brutal alpine conditions without compromising on comfort and breathability for everything from ski hut trips to backpacking.</p><h3>Minimalist</h3><p>It comes well-equipped for technical endeavors, thanks to a helmet-compatible hood, hand pockets that are accessible over a harness or hip belt, and a slim fit.</p><h3>Alpine</h3><p>Intended for serious alpine adventuring and backcountry skiing, the shell prioritizes mobility, climbing-focused features, and sturdy protection.</p>"
hiking pants for women,"<h2>Types of hiking pants for women</h2><p>There are three basic types of hiking pants for women, but all of them are designed to protect your legs from the elements. Which type you prefer will most likely be influenced by your budget, the season in which you plan to hike, and the terrain. Hiking pants can shield your legs from bugs, brambles, the sun, rain, and the cold to varying degrees depending on the type, so choose your pants wisely. No matter what type of pants you prefer, look for options that fit close to the body with a good deal of stretch in the fabric, articulated knees, and a gusseted crotch for maximum freedom of movement through the backcountry.</p><h3>Regular hiking pants</h3><p>Don't be fooled by the name ""regular hiking pants."" They aren't to be confused with regular pants like jeans made from materials that may not wick sweat and moisture from the skin. Hiking pants, a relatively recent innovation in the outdoor world, are specifically designed to be lightweight, breathable, and water-resistant. What we mean when we refer to regular hiking pants are those offering basic protection from the elements while also being stretchy, but won't necessarily keep you warm during cold-weather activities. Regular hiking pants may have zip-off lower legs or roll up, and come in loose or tighter fits, as well as tall and petite lengths.</p><h3>Softshell hiking pants</h3><p>Softshell hiking pants provide the same benefits as a good pair of regular hiking pants in terms of protecting you from the elements, but they expand your range of comfort during chilly outdoor activities thanks to their marginally heavier weight and available brushed cloth lining for added warmth. Softshell hiking pants also tend to be slightly less form-fitting than regular hiking pants, making them ideal for wearing a base layer underneath. Like regular hiking pants, soft shell hiking pants are not waterproof but can be worn under hard shell rain pants for added protection from rain and snow.</p><h3>Leggings</h3><p>OK people, I have a confession to make. I am cheap when it comes to buying clothing for outdoor activities, which is pretty counterintuitive considering how much time I spend doing stuff outside. When I hike in the summer, I generally do so in the same shorts I wear for running, and during the winter, my go-to base layer staple are my running leggings, which I frequently wear under my softshell hiking pants for added warmth and wind protection. Because of their stretch, moisture-wicking power, and insulating ability, I am a huge believer in wearing leggings for hiking. Some companies have started making tights specifically for hiking that offer reinforced panels on the knees and rear end or made from abrasion-resistant fabric for greater durability and protection from rocks and thorns. Arc'teryx Oriel Leggings are a great example of a versatile legging that can take you from trail to rock wall with ease and minimum scrapes. In my book, the only thing regular hiking pants have on leggings is the depth and quantity of their pockets, which sadly, leggings tend to lack.</p>"
bushcraft axes,"<h2>Types of bushcraft axes</h2><p>Bushcraft axes, like plenty of other axes, come in all different shapes, sizes, lengths, and weights. They can feature various kinds of cutting edges and head shapes, and each specific type of bushcraft axe can be used for specific needs or uses. Meant for wilderness skills and uses, most bushcraft axes are hardy and durable.</p><p>Typically, any bushcraft axe is meant to help you handle a variety of outdoor tasks. Part survival tool and part wood splitting and chopping tool, a bushcraft axe can cover skills like felling trees, chopping logs, cutting apart game, and even hammering tent stakes into hard ground. Survival tasks like chopping through ice and creating kindling are also possible with one of these axes.</p><p>To find just the right bushcraft axe for your needs, you can learn more about the different types of axes and their uses right here.</p><h3>Bushcraft Hatchet</h3><p>A bushcraft hatchet is a smaller, more compact axe that's designed to be held and used with just one hand. It's a perfectly portable option, with a handle that typically measures between 9 and 14 inches in length and an axe head that weighs between 1 and 1.5 pounds. With a bushcraft hatchet, you can tackle tasks like splitting small logs for firewood, carving various types of wood, and cutting limbs or clearing a path.</p><p>You shouldn't rely on a bushcraft hatchet for any chopping or cutting jobs that require you to slice through wood that's 2 inches or more in thickness. It's a better choice for smaller, one-handed jobs that don't require a ton of force or effort.</p><h3>Small bushcraft axe</h3><p>A small bushcraft axe is a step up from a hatchet. This kind of axe can be used one-handed or with both hands, and it's both longer and heavier. Small axes tend to have handles between 18 and 20 inches in length and a head that weighs between 1.5 and 2 pounds. It's able to handle larger pieces of wood and tougher jobs; you can use one of these bushcraft axes for carving, chopping, and splitting.</p><p>A small bushcraft axe is one of the most versatile options available, as it's still easy enough to carry anywhere and highly versatile. You can cut items up to 4 inches thick with one of these one- or two-handed cutting tools. It's even possible to take down medium-sized trees.</p><h3>Bushcraft felling axe</h3><p>A bushcraft felling axe is the right choice if you want an axe that can handle some seriously big tasks. It's the biggest kind you'll find for bushcraft use â€” these axes are significantly longer and heavier, and they're designed to take down big or even massive trees. Made just for felling, these axes tend to have handles between 24 and 30 inches long with a head that weighs between 2 and 4 pounds in total.</p><p>A felling axe isn't the most travel-ready option, but it's the best choice if you need to take down trees. These are great for anyone who's working on their own outdoor property or headed into thickly wooded areas.</p>"
hiking boots,"<h2>Types of hiking boots</h2><p>Hiking is a pretty broad term. Our own writers hike things like the Appalachian Trail and Mount Rainier. Some people hike the local park in less time than it takes their pumpkin spice latte to get cold. Those styles of nature walks require footwear with very different features. Price is another consideration. There's no need to break the bank on boots for casual hikes, but more ambitious endeavors are worth springing for something high-end. We're here to break down some of the main factors you need to evaluate.</p><h3>Casual hiking boots</h3><p>What's on your feet right now? Unless you're wearing combat boots, I'll go out on a limb and guess that it's something soft, lightweight, and flexible. That seems to be a winning recipe for comfort, so it's how most shoes feel. Casual hiking boots are very similar. Since they don't need to deal with heavy packs, uneven terrain, and slippery surfaces, this kind of hiking boot can prioritize short-term comfort. They're great for weekend trips around the local trails, walking the dog, or going for even everyday use. Don't push your luck, though, because they aren't built to handle the kind of terrain and strain that comes with backpacking and serious climbing. Fortunately, they tend to be affordable and stylish enough to wear around town.</p><h3>Traditional hiking boots</h3><p>Traditional hiking boots up the ante with additional features that make them more wilderness-ready than casual hiking boots or trail running shoes. This meant using leather and chunky soles back in the day, but now we get to enjoy lightweight synthetics and more advanced tread patterns if we want. This style of boot costs more than something designed for fashion or casual hikes. Expect to pay at least $75, but potentially as much as $150 for a pair of dedicated hiking boots. For the extra money, you'll get footwear that can support your ankles and feet on uneven terrain. More aggressive tread patterns will boost confidence in mud and loose dirt. Because they're intended to have a rough and tumble service life, true hiking boots are also notably more durable and longer-lasting than budget options.</p><h3>Backpacking boots</h3><p>At the top of the hiking boot food chain are the apex predators that are backpacking boots. This style of boot is intended to do everything hiking boots do but under a heavy load. They need to provide enough structure to prevent you from rolling an ankle and be comfortable and supportive without getting packed out under load. They need to keep your feet dry because it might be days until you can get back to the trailhead and change into something else. Accomplishing all this can make a boot quite heavy, which is the last thing you want on a backpacking trip. Solving that problem involves advanced materials that cost a pretty penny, so it isn't uncommon to see backpacking boots going for more than $200. They're worth it for serious hiking, though. Get a few days into a week-long backpacking trip, and I bet you'll agree.</p>"
whetstones,"<h2>Types of whetstones</h2><p>Whetstones come in so many different varieties. Just a quick search for whetstones will turn up thousands of choices in all kinds of different materials, shapes, and sharpening grits. But there's an easy way to begin narrowing down your options to find a quality product: Decide which type of whetstone you want to work with.</p><p>There are three common, overarching types of sharpening stones. Whetstones are divided into types based on how you use them to sharpen a knife: with oil, with water, or with tough diamonds. You can learn more about each kind below.</p><h3>Oil whetstones</h3><p>Oil whetstones are one of the most common kinds you'll encounter. Considered the ""traditional"" choice, these stones are natural stones made from either novaculite, aluminum oxide, or silicone carbide. In order to file your knife and sharpen its blade, you'll use oil to lubricate the metal against these stone varieties. Oil whetstones can offer different densities and create different finishes on your knife blades. Most leave behind a polished edge.</p><p>The biggest drawback of an oil whetstone is this kind of sharpening stone tends to cut metal more slowly compared to man-made stones. This slower cutting rate means you'll have to take more time to work on your knife, which can be frustrating. Additionally, because oil is the necessary lubricant, the process can be messy and harder to clean up.</p><h3>Water whetstones</h3><p>Water whetstones are another option, though they're a bit newer and still gaining popularity. Like oil whetstones, water whetstones can be made from natural stone â€” but they can also be made from synthetic materials. Synthetic water whetstones are the most common. Typically made of some kind of aluminum oxide variety, these sanding stones are abrasive but soft in their density. This makes water whetstones faster at cutting; they're able to break down old metal easily to sharpen quickly.</p><p>While faster cutting is the biggest advantage of water whetstones, the lubrication is another benefit. Water is easy to wipe down and clean up once you're done sharpening. However, there is one disadvantage: Water whetstones wear down quickly, and they tend to break apart more easily. This leads to uneven surfaces on your sharpening stone, which can make sharpening knives more difficult.</p><h3>Diamond whetstones</h3><p>Diamond whetstones are the toughest variety you can buy. They're actually made with small diamonds, which are attached to a metal plate. Those diamonds and their high hardness level cut very quickly, taking blades from dull to sharp in no time at all. There are two kinds of diamond whetstones to choose from: mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline. Both last a long time, but mono-crystalline are the most durable.</p><p>Diamond whetstones sharpen at a fast speed and stay flat even over many uses. There's just one drawback: the cost. These sharpening stones are very expensive, and they're an investment. However, you'll get a whetstone that lasts for the long term, which can be a benefit.</p>"
tool box,"<h2>Types of tool boxes</h2><p>There's a tool for every job, and it's important to pick the right kind of tool box to keep your collection in. Whether you have a few essentials for small fixes around the house or a full suite of professional tools and one of those air compressor lines that unrolls from the ceiling (which some of us desperately want, by the way), you need an appropriate place to store them.</p><h3>Handheld</h3><p>Small, portable tool boxes have been around as long as there have been job sites. Handheld tool boxes are intended to carry the essentials; not every tool you might need or a bunch of hardware. Traditionally, these were made from stamped metal and used a drop-in tray to separate large and small items.</p><p>We found plenty of options that use composite materials that are tough enough to endure life on a construction site without weighing you down. Some also have clever features like clear panels so you can see through the lid before rummaging around for something you need. If you only have a few tools, this is the way to go. It's also what we'd recommend for transporting part of your collection to an off-site project.</p><h3>Workbench</h3><p>Do you have more tools than your handheld tool box can store? Congratulations, it's time for an upgrade to a workbench. This is a joyous time, so relish the opportunity to turn your garage or basement into a genuine workspace. You'll enjoy a more tidy place to work and have plenty of drawers for all your tools and accessories.</p><p>We recommend looking for a workbench with locking casters that are stable when stationary, but easy to roll when you need them to. A fully-loaded workbench is heavier than you want to move without wheels. We also appreciate a practical work surface. Yes, wood is easy to scratch and dent, but it's forgiving and â€” in the worst-case scenario â€” easier and less expensive to replace than steel. These tool boxes are expensive, but they last long enough that you'll want to get the best you can afford the first time around.</p><h3>Truck tool boxes</h3><p>Trucks are great for getting work done. They've got plenty of cargo room, four-wheel drive, and lots of ground clearance. Unfortunately, they're also great for getting your tools jacked the second you look away. Sooner or later, all truck owners realize that ""finders keepers"" is a very real thing.</p><p>Truck tool boxes mount to the bed from the inside, so only you can remove them. Locking lids let you secure your tools and keep them protected from the elements. Inside, there's a huge amount of space for large power tools, multiple handheld tool boxes, and even your lunch. They also leave several inches of space between the bottom of the box and the bed of your truck so you can still fit things like plywood underneath.</p>"
reloading kit,"<h2>Types of reloading kits</h2><p>Reloading isn't complicated, but it does require attention to detail. The first step is acquiring all the right pieces. The best way to start is with a well-equipped kit. Once you have a quality press, scale, and tools, you can add dies for the specific calibers you plan on reloading.</p><p>Once you have a kit, you'll need raw materials. Casings, primers, powder, and bullets can be found in a wide range of specifications to help you create the ideal load. There are also accessories like case tumblers, brass catchers, and tutorials to make the whole process easier.</p><h3>Press</h3><p>The first thing you'll need to start reloading is a press. Loading ammunition requires precision, and you need a tool that can install a primer, load powder, and press a bullet in place safely, securely, and with incredible consistency.</p><p>The presses on our list use a die to hold each casing firmly in place. By activating a handheld lever, you can apply pressure straight on in exactly the correct place. Compact presses require more finesse, but take up less space and are relatively inexpensive. Table presses make the whole reloading process much faster and help prevent mistakes. A good press isn't cheap, but we consider it a necessary investment for anyone interested in reloading.</p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>Once you have a press and set up your workstation, it's time to add a few accessories that are specific to what you want to accomplish. If you want to reuse spent brass, a catcher mounted to your rifle can make range cleanup a breeze. Because the casings never hit the ground, you won't have to worry about picking up one that's been stepped on or dented. Add a tumbler and breathe new life into used casings by cleaning them far better than you could by hand.</p><p>Finally, we recommend continuously developing your knowledge and skill. Don't just rely on personal experience. Regularly learning about the science of reloading with a well-selected book can make you safer and more successful.</p><h3>Consumables</h3><p>Lastly, you'll need the materials to reload your own ammunition. Casings can be purchased or, at times, reused. They aren't reusable forever, though, so keep track of which have been fired previously and which are new. Primers are single-use items, so you'll need to keep plenty in stock.</p><p>Gunpowder is far from uniform, so do some research to determine which powders perform best in the applications you're likely to encounter. It should go without saying but always weigh your powder carefully to ensure safe and accurate ammunition.</p><p>Finally, the bullets you use will affect performance and cost. There's no need to waste high-dollar hunting bullets on paper targets, and you wouldn't want to take range-day bulk products into the field. We recommend investing in some of both, but save the good stuff until you have your reloading skills dialed in.</p>"
utility knives,"<h2>Types of utility knives</h2><p>Utility knives come in many different forms and sizes. No matter what task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, it's probable that you'll easily find a utility knife that suits your needs. You can find them at pretty much any hardware or big box store, and they're available at pretty much every price point.</p><h3>EDC/folder</h3><p>Also referred to as a pocket knife, a folder is a compact knife that features one or more blades that fold up into the handle, in lieu of using a bulky sheath. Meant to fit easily inside your pocket, these knives are legal to carry in most places, and are convenient to carry and use daily. They are frequently smaller than fixed blades, with blades typically between three and four inches long, although there are many exceptions that are both longer and shorter than this. However, they're quite handy â€” they can do everything from peeling an apple to cutting small rope or twine to opening packages. Though these folding knives are typically smaller and not as strong as their fixed blade siblings, they're highly versatile.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>A fixed blade is any knife with a blade that is ""fixed"" in place, meaning that it doesn't have a pivot, and is firmly, immovably attached to the handle. They're essentially the opposite of pocket knives. The blade is always exposed unless it's covered by a sheath. They're simple, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly due to the absence of a confusing locking mechanism.</p><p>Fixed blade utility knives come in many varieties, including drop-point and wharncliffe-style knives. The better-designed fixed blades are also full-tang, where the part of the blade that's part of the handle is the same size and shape as the handle, as this provides the greatest overall strength. The majority of cheap utility fixed blades, unfortunately, are not; these knives have a thin metal â€˜tail' that is typically pinned or glued inside of the handle and are more prone to breaking.</p><h3>Multitool</h3><p>Though technically a sub-category of folding knives, the main selling point of a multitool isn't the blade itself, but rather the multiple tools that accompany it. This can include anything from pliers or scissors to screwdrivers and corkscrews. It can come in the form of a small Swiss Army Knife, or a larger Leatherman multitool. Companies such as Victorinox, Leatherman, and Gerber are well-known for their multitool offerings.</p><h3>Retractable</h3><p>One of the most common utility knives, retractable knives can be found everywhere from warehouses to the office, and chances are, even your house. Retractable utility knives are usually very inexpensive, typically taking the form of box-cutters and snap-blades. The latter features pre-scored lines in the blade, allowing you to snap off dull segments and extend the blade further to utilize the remaining undulled blade.</p>"
tactical gloves,"<h2>Types of tactical gloves</h2><p>Picking out the right pair of tactical gloves is all about planning ahead. Think about where you are most likely to use them. Is it on the shooting range? Surviving the wilderness? In a fistfight? By figuring out where you plan to use the gloves, you can identify the type that will most match your needs.</p><h3>Full-finger shooting gloves</h3><p>Used in law enforcement and the military, full-finger gloves offer the highest level of protection. By avoiding exposed skin, you can more easily protect yourself. It's a lot easier to get cut or scratched without protection, and the full-finger design gives you a layer of security. These gloves are usually made out of more than one material. Typically, it includes leather (either natural or artificial), polyester, and microfiber. Higher-quality models also include a kevlar layer, though this adds to their weight.</p><p>Where full-finger shooting gloves shine is in the overall grip and design of the trigger fingers. The gloves â€” both the fingers and palms â€” are meant to give you a good grip. For shooting, these fingers have extra flexibility, making it easier to bend the joint. Finally, this type of glove has thinner fingertips to let you feel your surroundings more easily.</p><h3>Fingerless tactical gloves</h3><p>There are situations where you need to protect your whole hand. Other times call for all the dexterity you can get. Fingerless gloves are the type of tactical gear for the latter circumstance.</p><p>Made out of the same material as full-finger gloves, these offer wrist protection. Attaching to the top part of your wrist, the gloves help to keep you stabilized. The palm cover lends to better grip and prevents issues like rope burn and other abrasions. The material rises to just above your knuckles, leaving the middle joint on your finger open.</p><p>By leaving the fingers open, two benefits come to light. The first is that the gloves breathe better. Your hands can stay dry and at a comfortable, cool temperature more easily. Plus, since you can feel surfaces, you literally get tactile and tactical advantages.</p><h3>Touchscreen-compatible tactical gloves</h3><p>It's no secret that communication is a massive part of any tactical maneuver, and in current times, that means your smartphone. From location-tracking via GPS on your devices to basics like making an emergency call, you need to be able to use your phone quickly. Touchscreen-compatible tactical gloves let you control the screen without removing your gear.</p><p>Eliminating issues with the reliability of voice commands on your phone, these gloves incorporate metal in the textile. Usually either aluminum or copper, these fibers can run a current (like your bare skin does). The fingertips of the gloves incorporate the metal so you can use your phone. Since it is woven into the regular fabric, there isn't a scratching risk on the screen.</p>"
compression socks,"<h2>Types of compression socks</h2><p>All compression socks need to provide even force on your calves and feet, though not all socks are made alike. Because of the vascular benefits of this gear, they are useful in tons of situations. Depending on how you plan to use them, whether it's to relax and heal or kill it at your next workout, you'll need a specific type of compression socks.</p><h3>Graduated</h3><p>This type of socks is designed to provide the most amount of compression at the ankle, making them well-suited for athletic uses. The pressure reduces as the sock rises up the calf, making it easier to move around since your blood can flow readily. However, since these socks have such specific amounts of compression needed in exact places, it can be hard to find the right fit without a podiatric consultation.</p><p>The socks in this category generally end just below the knee and are able to limit the accrual of fluid in your legs called edema. If you plan to use these for exercise, it's worth seeking out extra features like moisture wicking and durability. Some models have reinforced heels and toes to limit wear and tear due to friction. These are ideal for runners and outdoor exercisers.</p><h3>Non-medical</h3><p>Some of the most popular amongst the modern population, these socks don't require a prescription though offer the same level of comfort for those without a medical condition. Typically, these are made out of nylon or polyester blended with spandex. The former gives durability and ventilation while the spandex provides the squeezing effect for which the socks are known.</p><p>Unlike other types, these socks provide a consistent amount of compression throughout the socks. As a result, these are preferred for use when at rest. If you are healing from an injury or worried about the pressure changes on an airplane ride, this is the type of sock to get. Generally, it is pretty easy to find a fit with these socks so long as you take a measurement of your calf and consult the sizing chart from the manufacturer.</p><h3>Medical</h3><p>These socks are less common, largely due to the fact that they are usually recommended through a prescription as opposed to the consumer seeking them out. The socks are meant to offer a high level of compression throughout the material. This is to assist in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis, a painful medical condition.</p><p>Similar to graduated compression socks, the amount of force applied to the foot and legs is not consistent across the socks. Like graduated models, the pressure is greatest at the ankles and lessens as the socks get closer to the knee. The mmHg (millimetres of mercury, a blood pressure measurement that refers to systolic over diastolic readings) will be highest on this type of sock.</p>"
winter hiking boots,"<h2>Types of winter hiking boots</h2><p>While hiking boots in general have a decent range of sub-niches, winter hiking boots tend to be more specialized than the broader hiker category. Still, winter hiking boots do have some degree of diversity worth exploring. Standard winter hiking boots tend to be warmer (and heavier) than their warm-weather brothers, and those built for hunting and extremely cold temps come with some additional features.</p><h3>Backpacking boots</h3><p>Backpacking may seem like an elite outdoor sport for some (or a sadistic form of self-punishment for others). Whatever the case, a reliable pair of winter backpacking boots is non-negotiable for that special breed of hiker. Predictably, winter backpacking boots are a breed all their own as well.</p><p>Easily the biggest difference between a traditional hiking boot and a backpacking boot is the extra ankle support found in the backpacker's footwear, although upgraded durability and toughness are equally as important. While it may go without saying, winter backpacking boots demand all the same features as traditional backpacking boots but with the obvious need for insulation, waterproofing, and other winter-specific features.</p><h3>Hunting boots</h3><p>Traditionally, hiking and hunting boots have tended to fall into different categories, thanks to somewhat different user demographics. That said, when the rubber meets the gravel, the differences between boots designed for active winter hunts and those created for winter hikes are surprisingly minimal. Both are insulated, provide good ankle support, and are designed for long hours in the backcountry.</p><p>Due to their need to battle lower temps, hunting boots, like winter hikers, tend to pack on the ounces thanks to critical insulation layers, although both designs emphasize lightweight construction. In terms of fit and feel, hunting boots may have slightly more flexible soles to provide better ground feel and a slightly warm insulation due to the generally slower pace of hunting.</p><p>Additionally, hunting boots frequently include scent-proof membranes or other scent-killing features. We all know the lethal consequences of overexposure to sweaty feet and boots, but it turns out even a minor whiff of said odor can kill a mountain hunt faster than you can blink.</p><h3>Extreme cold boots</h3><p>Winter hiking boots designed for the extreme cold may be your best option if you live in Montana, Alaska, or other absurdly cold and rugged locales. These hikers combine critical hiking boots elements with the best snow boots have to offer for an extremely warm, go-anywhere hiker.</p><p>Usually, these boots are optimized a little more for use in the snow, but they still provide plenty of grip for rocks, gravel, and other significant terrain features. These boots boast some top-notch insulation, and many include extra sole thickness to increase underfoot insulation. Of course, all these add-ons will increase the overall weight, but the tradeoff is warmth that'll keep icicles off your toes.</p>"
air mattresses for camping,"<h2>Types of air mattresses for camping</h2><h3>Closed-cell</h3><p>Lately, I've noticed more and more thru-hikers with accordion-style sleeping pads attached to the backs of their packs. After rolling into way too many campsites late in the afternoon after long days on the trail and having to spend what feels like an eternity blowing up my air mattress, I can see the appeal.</p><p>The name comes from the material used to manufacture the pad, rigid closed cell foam (CCF), which is a dense material with tiny trapped air pockets for insulation and cushioning. While closed-cell sleeping pads don't provide the same R-value or comfort most blow-up mattresses will, they are lightweight, easy to set up, puncture-resistant, and way less expensive than most other sleep system options. They can also be layered for additive R-value and cushioning if you have the room.</p><h3>Inflatable</h3><p>Inflatable camping mattresses look a lot like pool mattresses. Both are generally made from the same type of polyvinyl material and when blown up provide 2.5- to 3-inches of air between your backside and the ground. Many inflatable camping mattresses also contain reflective material inside for additional insulation and comfort. Depending on whether you are a back or side sleeper, the firmness mattress can be tailored to suit your sleep style by simply adding a few extra breaths during setup.</p><p>While they take more time to blow up and take down than close cell options, can make a lot of noise if you toss and turn at night, and are more to puncture, inflatable mattresses are generally lightweight, cost-effective, pack down to less than the size of a Nalgene bottle, and provide excellent camping comfort. Four-season inflatable mattresses even contain down insulation for extra insulation, and many air mattresses even have a pump, either separate or integrated into their stuff sacks, for faster set up.</p><h3>Self-inflating</h3><p>Self-inflating camping mattresses are constructed out of a combination of open-cell foam and polyvinyl, providing up to 4-inches of insulation and max cushioning and comfort. To set up a self-inflating mattress, all you have to do is unroll the pad, open the air valve, and wait 20 to 30 minutes for the air cells in the foam to expand. You can even add air by manually adding a few breaths to the pad for firmer support.</p><p>Thanks to their dual-material construction, self-inflating camping mattresses provide arguably the most warmth, comfort, and quiet, regardless of your sleep style or the season. The downside is that this style of mattress is heavier and doesn't pack down as small as a regular air mattress. However, if comfort is king for you and you can spare the room in your pack on your camping excursions, a self-inflating mattress is a luxurious and warm good way to go.</p>"
butterfly knives,"<h2>Types of butterfly knives</h2><p>As you scour the catalogs of knife vendors searching for your ideal butterfly knife, you may begin to realize that they're not necessarily segregated into any specific category. A lot of them seem to do almost the exact same thing with much of the differences being more subjective rather than objective. In short, you probably won't see butterfly knives in the loadouts of soldiers or wildlife rangers. Even so, there are some knives, however, that are able to take care of certain jobs just a little bit better than others. Here are a few disciplines through which a balisong can distinguish itself.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>Balisongs favoring EDC duty may stand out with big, utilitarian blades or an overall compact design that's friendly on the pocket. Nearly all of them would have built-in pocket clips for ease of transport. Those with spring-loaded latches are easier to deploy and safer to secure on a regular basis until needed. Such knives will often feature the most robust, corrosion-resistant, and dependable build quality to ensure a long life.</p><h3>Self-defense</h3><p>These won't always be the most featureful knives that can rip through the wind like Sonic the Hedgehog, but they'll certainly be sharp enough to tear like Wolverine. Knives that best suit this category will often be the sharpest of flippers, typically larger spear points or bayonet-types, constructed with durable blade materials that can take a beating. Nicer examples may also feature spring-loaded latches for easier, quicker deployment in tense situations as well as pocket clips to aid in EDC duty.</p><h3>Trainers</h3><p>As per the name, trainers are literally intended to train enthusiasts how to properly deploy and flip their butterfly knives with minimal risk of injury. They'll be constructed under the same standards and build quality as the real thing and often using the same materials. Some high-end trainers may even use ball bearing pivots just like more premium butterfly knives. All trainers will feature the same common trait: a dull, rounded-off edge all the way around the blade eliminating the risk of cutting one's self.</p><h3>Novelty</h3><p>Remember the bottle opener and the pen? Yeah, that's as novelty as novelty gets. But there are plenty of novelty butterfly knives out there as the blade has become equally romanticized and demonized in modern times. Since they don't technically function as a real knife, some may consider trainers to be novelties for playing around with. Cheap, decorative knives with a priority on form over function may also fall under this category, knives constructed of cheap steel and wrapped in fancy pearlescent colors and such. You wouldn't use them to carve wood. You probably wouldn't think to use one for opening mail. But they definitely look pretty up on a shelf.</p>"
backpacking sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of backpacking sleeping bags</h2><p>Shopping for a good backpacking sleeping bag can be a bewildering experience. It helps to first identify what you will use the bag for prior to starting your search. The more dialed in your anticipated needs, the easier it is to filter out the bags that won't satisfy</p><p>Backpacking sleeping bags are different from regular camping sleeping bags in three important ways: they're lighter, they pack smaller, and they have a higher warmth-to-weight ratio. When considering your purchase, select the bag with the best warmth-to-weight ratio that will meet the needs of most of your trips and carry the lightest and most compressible you can afford. Every ounce in your pack counts when traveling dozens of miles day after day. Also, remember that your sleeping bag depends on what's underneath it for optimal efficiency, so check out the R-value of your sleeping pad. Try to get a lightweight one that has an R-value greater than four. Backpacking sleeping bags come generally with two choices of insulation: synthetic or down.</p><h3>Synthetic</h3><p>The advantages of synthetic insulation are twofold. Most importantly, synthetic insulation performs better when wet because it does a much better job retaining its loft and it also tends to dry out faster than down. They also generally cost less. The disadvantages are that synthetic bags don't compress as small as their down counterparts, and they weigh more for the same insulative performance. Synthetic is better in damp conditions and is non-allergenic.</p><h3>Down</h3><p>Down remains nature's best insulator, as it has a very high warmth-to-weight ratio and incredible compressibility. Down bags weigh less and compress smaller than synthetic filled bags, and they also cost more â€” sometimes much more. Down fibers also tend to last longer than synthetics which compress over time and lose R-value. On the downside, down is also a cold mess when wet because when wet, the feathers clump and lose their ability to trap dead air to insulate, leaving you a frigid, shivering mess. The good news is that it's not that hard to keep a down bag dry these days with DWR-treated shells and water-resistant down. Down is best in cold, dry conditions.</p><h3>Shape</h3><p>Backpacking sleeping bags are almost exclusively mummy-shaped bags which increase warmth and minimize weight through a more form-fitting design. Semi-rectangular or rectangular-shaped bags are generally for camping since they are heavier and tend to be colder due to the increased interior volume (your body has to heat up all that air).</p><h3>Season</h3><p>Although there isn't an industry-wide hard and fast rule, I consider any bag that's rated 20F or above to be a three-season bag (spring, summer, and fall use), and any bag that's rated below 20F to be a four-season bag.</p>"
camping canopy,"<h2>Types of camping canopies</h2><p>Though all camping canopies have the same goal â€” protecting campers from the elements â€” not all canopies are made alike. Since all environments and weather conditions are different, it's important to figure out which type of camping canopy you need. By opting for the best-suited option, you can optimize the level of protection you receive.</p><h3>Tarp canopy</h3><p>This is perhaps the most versatile type of camping canopy since, in effect, it is a flat piece of material that you can structure however works best for the situation. You can find tarp canopies in all colors and sizes. If you're focused on tactical advantage, opt for something compact and camouflage. Recreational camping may see more benefits from larger tarps, and the color is of less importance.</p><p>The two most important features of a tarp canopy are water resistance and tensile strength. In order to offer suitable protection, it must shield you against the rain and the wind. The durability of the tarp is directly related to the weight it can support, so be sure to choose something suitably strong.</p><h3>Vaulted canopy</h3><p>This type of canopy typically comes with a tent or is built to be an addition to an existing structure. Like the other types of canopy, it must be able to resist moisture and wind. So long as the canopy itself is strong enough, it won't be vulnerable to wind or debris. The vaulted shape adds to this strength since it angles any water or dust away from the top and stops it from building up.</p><p>A vaulted canopy is ideal for casual camping. If it comes with a frame, the vaulted design gives you more room to move around. It's worth noting that, in most cases, it takes more effort to set these canopies up. They are more time-consuming to set up and take down, so it's better to opt for these if you have the time to spare.</p><h3>Curved canopy</h3><p>Often attached to a vehicle, a curved canopy is perhaps one of the most convenient types of camping canopy. Since half of the frame is the vehicle itself, they are fairly easy to set up. Most feature an internal frame (either steel, aluminum, or fibreglass). This curves upwards to give you room to move around and meets legs at the far end. These connect to weights that keep the canopy in place.</p><p>So long as it is sturdy, water-resistant, and able to withstand wind, it should offer suitable protection. The most important thing to look at is the height of the curve at its top point. Be sure that you can comfortably move beneath it, so that the canopy gives you full protection without your needing to crouch.</p>"
two way radio,"<h2>Types of two-way radios</h2><p>Governed by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), airwaves are sorted depending on the purpose of the radio. You wouldn't want a stranger chirping in while you're relaying specific or sensitive information, and by sticking to the proper radio types, you can avoid this. The right radio ensures that whether you are communicating military jargon, chewing the fat, or dealing with sensitive information, you are entirely secure.</p><h3>FRS & GMRS</h3><p>Short for Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service, these bandwidths are built for business, personal, and recreational use. An FRS radio has a wattage limit of two and the channels have a range of roughly a quarter-mile in normal situations. These radios give you access to 22 channels, with over half of them being low-power options that rely on a half-watt system. FRS radios are governed by Part 95 of FCC regulations.</p><p>At one point, GMRS radios were lumped together with FRS radios, but since 2017 this has changed. Nowadays, they are deemed separate. A GMRS radio requires a license, unlike its counterpart. It can access 30 channels overall, though only 22 of them can be reached with these models. They also stand out because the system uses power over two watts. Also governed by Part 95 of FCC rules, a household needs only one license.</p><h3>Amateur ham radios</h3><p>Usually referred to as standard Ham radios, these are regulated by part 97 of FCC regulations. Accessible to those of all ages, these radios require a license to legally operate them. Depending on the level of that license, you can access different frequencies. It is by far the most powerful type of two-way radio, though it is also bulky and more administratively tedious.</p><p>These radios usually consist of a large central structure that links to an external antenna. Though you can find some mobile options, they are still far less convenient than other options. However, the function is more advanced. You can access UHF, VHF, and HF frequencies, giving you the chance to fiddle with morse, pictures, and video communications.</p><h3>Citizen's band radios</h3><p>Designed for business and personal applications, these two-way radios often come at a higher price point than GMRS counterparts. There is no license needed to operate these devices, governed by part 95 of FCC regulations. The radios can also be used by those of any age and are common in the transportation industry.</p><p>These radios have access to 40 channels in AM settings and in Single SideBand mode. However, as a result of the fact that these channels are shared, it is not a desirable system for secure communications. In most cases, you will find these two-way radios in long-haul trucks because of the structure and range.</p>"
binoculars for hunting,"<h2>Types of hunting binoculars</h2><h3>Roof prism binoculars</h3><p>Binoculars aren't just about the lenses. Each set of binoculars contains a set of prisms whose primary function is to invert the image collected by the concave lenses, therefore returning it to be ""right-side-up"" before delivering it to the user's eye. There are two prism types common in hunting binoculars: roof prism and Porro prism.</p><p>The roof prism type contains prisms within the binoculars that are set in a straight line or overlapping fashion. This allows the objective lenses to be directly in line with the eyepieces and means the binoculars can be built with a more compact, linear design. Roof prism binoculars have become the most popular in the field of hunting, purely because of its ease of carry and more compact build.</p><h3>Porro prism binoculars</h3><p>The Porro prism type contains two prisms offset from one another, which means the objective lenses are set wider than the eyepieces, making these binoculars bulkier and cumbersome. Without a doubt, the Porro prism type binoculars offer better optical qualities and brighter/clearer images, but there's just no getting around the practicality of the roof prism binos when it comes to hunting.</p><h3>Compact binoculars</h3><p>Compact binoculars are certainly great when it comes to reducing weight in your pack or around your neck, and there are many great pairs that can fit most of your hunting needs. The thing with compact binoculars is that when you make the trade-off for a smaller size, you're usually looking at small objective lenses (somewhere around the 25mm range is typical). Having smaller objective lenses isn't the end of the world, but it does mean that less light will be collected and your overall image will be less bright and vivid.</p><h3>Long-range binoculars</h3><p>With long-range binoculars, you're usually going to go the opposite way with size. Longer ranges usually require higher magnification and larger objective lenses (12x magnification and up and usually 50mm diameter objective lenses). While these can be great when you're poring over valleys from a high peak, you'll probably want a tripod of some sort to get the best result. Most long-range binoculars are equipped to handle a tripod attachment, so there shouldn't be any issue there.</p><h3>Low-light binoculars</h3><p>Low-light binoculars tend to incorporate a lot of other subtypes because there are several different methods for improving light transmission within a set of binos. For instance, many types of Porro prism binos are considered low-light binoculars simply because their prism structure is specifically designed to maximize light transmission. Other binoculars could be considered low-light binoculars due to the size of their objective lenses and even further due to complex, and often proprietary, lens coatings that are specifically engineered to maximize light transmission.</p>"
metal detectors,"<h2>Types of metal detectors</h2><p>Metal detectors span a huge variety of sizes, prices, and capabilities. At the little end of the spectrum are pinpoint metal detectors, and at the opposite end are the commercial-grade metal detectors that can be found in large-scale search operations. For this gear guide, we wanted to focus on products that any one of us could afford and comfortably put to use. Tech Metals Research has a fantastic in-depth breakdown of these categories if you want more information.</p><h3>Very low frequency</h3><p>Most recreational metal detectors use very low frequency signals to locate metal objects underground. These signals interact with the magnetic fields of a piece of metal and produce an audible tone, a visible indicator, or both. Simple technology results in a very affordable price. VLF metal detectors are also user-friendly, making them a great choice for beginners.</p><p>The drawback of this style is a limited signal that sometimes struggles to discern between different kinds of feedback. Certain soil types can generate interference that produces false positives. For the money, though, that's a compromise we're happy to make. If you're getting into metal detecting for fun or to do small projects around the house, there's nothing wrong with purchasing a VLF metal detector. This is what you'll find in this gear guide.</p><h3>Multi-frequency</h3><p>Higher up the price range are multi-frequency metal detectors. Rather than the single frequency used by VLF metal detectors, these broaden their output to more effectively search for objects of different sizes in different locations. It's important to know that not all multi-frequency metal detectors offer the same capabilities. Many scan all their frequencies simultaneously, while selectable-frequency metal detectors allow the operator to choose which ones to use in any given situation. Think of that as refining search criteria.</p><p>This sophistication does come with a significant jump in price, so these are best left to more experienced hobbyists. If you have room in your budget and the time to practice with one of these, more power to you.</p><h3>Pulse induction</h3><p>Pulse induction metal detectors benefit from a much more refined signal that offers improved performance in challenging terrains like soil with high mineral content and the salty sand at the beach. Rather than a continuous output, these metal detectors fire individual signals hundreds of times every second and interpret the feedback they get from each one. This also allows them to reach depths beyond what you could search with other metal detectors.</p><p>These capabilities make pulse induction metal detectors very popular among people searching for gold or scanning the beach. The advantages are significant and impressive, but the cost is enough to keep them out of reach for most amateurs.</p>"
bug out backpack,"<h2>Types of bug-out backpacks</h2><p>There are many different choices when it comes to picking out a tactical bug-out backpack. Depending on whether you need something for rural or urban environments, and based on the type of emergency, you'll need a different type of bag. To up your odds of making it through an emergency unscathed, picking the right bag is essential.</p><h3>72-hour assault bag</h3><p>This is one of the most popular types of bug-out backpacks since getting through the first three days of an emergency is the most critical part. The key to this type of bag is storage capacity. For the bag to be able to support gear for a full three days, it needs to be able to hold at least 40 liters of supplies.</p><p>These bags also need to be able to support sleeping gear by featuring a y-shaped strap on the back. Additionally, this type of bag incorporates room for a hydration pack and often features a holster built-into the bag. Molle mesh is found on just about all of these bags since it enhances storage features. Because these bags require you to plan ahead for a specific type of emergency, it is best when you know what enemy you are likely to face.</p><h3>Go-bag</h3><p>A go-bag is the iconic type of bug-out bag. You keep it by the door so you can grab it and run. As a result, this type of bag needs to be compact, rugged, and waterproof. It should incorporate multiple compartments so you can separate your supplies. In the spirit of bugging-out, this type of bag needs to be able to accommodate a lot of weight.</p><p>Most of these bags are made out of Oxford cloth, a high-density material that isn't prone to rips or tears. With reinforced seams and a lining to keep the contents free of water damage, this type of bag usually has padded straps so that you can stay on the move without getting sore.</p><h3>Survival bag</h3><p>A survival bag is one of the more versatile types of bug-out bags, meant to accommodate all the essential supplies for staying alive. These are easy to plan ahead with since, as long as you've got water, fire, shelter, weapons, and food, you can get through most scenarios. The survival bag will have a medium to large capacity and must be waterproof to qualify.</p><p>Typically, these bags will have several smaller pockets in addition to the interior compartments. Most incorporate a molle system to make it easier to access your gear. You can spot a survival bag by its hydration system, with the majority including a straw set up so you can drink while on the move.</p>"
iphone wallet case,"<h2>Types of iPhone wallet cases</h2><p>iPhone cases come in many styles, materials, and shapes â€“and so do wallet-style cases. There are a ton of options available to choose from, and there's truly something for every kind of iPhone user. Whether you're looking for something sleek and slim or something larger and more akin to a full-size wallet, it's all possible. You can learn more about some of the most common types of iPhone wallet cases here.</p><h3>Slim iPhone wallet cases</h3><p>Slim iPhone wallet cases are the most streamlined and pocket-friendly option available. These cases aim to reduce the overall size of your phone in its case, keeping it as close to your iPhone's original size as possible. So, these cases typically feature a few card and cash slots, which are often placed at the back of the case.</p><p>The one downside to a slim case is that your cards are typically a bit exposed. Because this kind of case tends to put your cards on the back of your phone, they can be left a little open to the world at large. While they're pretty secure, this can be a disadvantage to some.</p><h3>Folio iPhone wallet cases</h3><p>Folio iPhone wallet cases are larger and a bit bulkier. They wrap your entire phone in protection, covering it from back to front edges. This kind of wallet case features a folio, or a flap, that folds over your iPhone's screen and covers it. On the interior side of this flap is the wallet â€” it includes card and cash slots. These types of cases often also include small zippered pockets to hold change or other very small items.</p><p>Folio wallet cases offer more of a full-size and traditional wallet that's attached to your iPhone. However, they can be bulky and tricky to fit in some pockets. These cases also require you to physically open them in order to use your phone, which some might find to be a drawback.</p><h3>Stick-on iPhone wallet cases</h3><p>Stick-on iPhone wallet cases are a kind of quick and easy case solution. In fact, they aren't really even full cases in the traditional sense. This kind of iPhone wallet doesn't cover the entire back and sides of your phone; instead, it's a slim piece of plastic, polyurethane, or leather that sticks right onto the backside of your phone. It includes card slots so you can slide in cash or cards and carry them right on your iPhone.</p><p>Because stick-on wallet cases aren't anything like a traditional case, they can't protect your phone if you drop it. These little wallets can, however, be stuck onto some cases, allowing you to combine protection with convenience.</p>"
spotting scopes,"<h2>Types of spotting scopes</h2><p>Spotting scopes can be categorized by their construction. The way they're built determines which advantages and disadvantages you'll be working with, so it's important to understand what you're getting into. None of the factors we break down are better or worse than one another, they're just different. As you do your research, pay attention to whether a spotting scope is straight or angled. Most use unmarked glass, but some feature a reticle that can be used to gauge distances or make shot adjustments.</p><h3>Straight spotting scopes</h3><p>Straight spotting scopes look similar to a large rifle scope or a small telescope. Many hunters prefer them because their slim shape is easy to pack. This style also allows fast target acquisition because you can line them up before going to the glass. You can also keep a lower profile, which is good in hunting and tactical situations.</p><p>On the downside, they're awkward to use on an incline (but more comfortable facing downhill). If you're part of a group that will be sharing the optic, people of different heights will have a harder time getting to eye level with a straight spotting scope.</p><h3>Angled spotting scopes</h3><p>Angled spotting scopes are generally shorter end-to-end, but they take up more space than a straight scope. Many people find that bending over an angled eyepiece is easier than getting behind a straight one. A lot of guides attach cameras or digital displays to their spotting scopes, and this type of setup works much better with an angled eyepiece.</p><p>The tradeoff to being easier to use on an incline is that angled spotting scopes require serious neck contortions to use on a decline. They can also be cumbersome to use when mounted to a vehicle's window. You'll also have to be more mindful of snow and rain accumulating on the eyepiece.</p><h3>Spotting scopes with a reticle</h3><p>The vast majority of spotting scopes use an unmarked reticle. They provide an unobstructed view of the target. Some, on the other hand, include a reticle similar to what you'd see on a rifle scope. There are various styles, including MIL and MOA markings. A reticle can be used to estimate range and is especially useful when talking a shooter onto a target.</p><p>Having a reticle on your spotting scope seems like a significant advantage, but most people choose not to use one. Finding this kind of scope takes a little bit of digging, and using one effectively requires practice. We were able to track one down for this gear guide (and at a great price, we might add), but most spotting scopes use unmarked lenses to provide a clear view.</p>"
fire starter,"<h2>Types of fire starters</h2><p>Starting a fire is simple; you need air, fuel, and spark. There are several ways to go about this. Air is a given. Fuel can come in the form of logs, charcoal, or propane, but you'll need quality tinder to get the main event kicked off. The spark can be created using friction, fuel, or electricity. What works in the backyard fire pit might not always be sufficient in a survival situation. Feel free to find the right combination for you.</p><h3>Friction</h3><p>The most basic way to start a fire (aside from being in the right place at the right time during a lightning storm) is with a good old-fashioned bow drill. You can theoretically do the same thing freehand, but it takes way more effort and the likelihood of success is low. Ferro rods make the process easier by replacing wood with steel and combustible ferrocerium.</p><p>This is probably the most rewarding way to start a fire because it takes the most skill. The principles can also be put to use with a homemade bow drill or flint and steel in an emergency, so you can take comfort in building a lifelong skill. Just be prepared to spend a significant amount of time learning how to use these tools effectively.</p><h3>Fuel</h3><p>Yes, lighters that run on fuel still require spark. In a Zippo, for example, you still create sparks by turning the friction wheel with your thumb. The difference is that fuel is carried internally, so you don't have to transfer those sparks to your tinder. Once lit, liquid fuel will continue to burn in a controlled manner until you shut off the supply.</p><p>This is the most common style of lighter. It's light, portable, reliable, and inexpensive. Lighter fluid burns well even when it's raining or cold, and is fairly resistant to wind. The drawback is having to refill the lighter fluid frequently. Disposable lighters are cheap, but you get what you pay for and you're better off buying a quality lighter from the start.</p><h3>Electricity</h3><p>Rather than storing lighter fluid, plasma lighters use electricity to generate enough heat to cause tinder to combust. This approach is clean, reliable, and sustainable. Instead of relying on a supply of lighter fluid, you can plug one of these into a portable solar panel and have quick, convenient access to fire indefinitely.</p><p>Durable, waterproof bodies and compact batteries make this style of lighter a compelling option for any survival kit. Solar charging gives them the potential to be your most sustainable option, but plan ahead and buy a solar panel and battery backup to set yourself up for success.</p>"
hiking pants for men,"<h2>Types of hiking pants for men</h2><p>All hiking pants are designed to be functional, but that can take on a few different meanings. Rather than narrowing your search down to a specific brand, focus on what you plan on doing in your new hiking pants. Hikes that involve climbing, mountaineering, or tactical training will require different pants than hikes that are strictly about walking from point A to point B.</p><h3>Tactical pants</h3><p>If your hikes involve any kind of firing range, small unit tactics, or hunting permit, tactical pants are probably the best bet when it comes to hiking pants. The foundation is still thereâ€“â€“they're lightweight, breathable, and built to last. As with any specialized hiking pant, the devil's in the details.</p><p>Tactical pants prioritize range of movement. In addition to walking and running, they need to facilitate the more dynamic movements of climbing over obstacles and getting into various standing, kneeling, or prone shooting positions. They may include stash pockets for small items like keys and identification tags. Many tactical pants are designed for government contractors, so they tend to be understated and appropriate for wear around town.</p><h3>Climbing pants</h3><p>Would you rather hike in climbing pants or scale a cliff in generic hiking pants? That's a no-brainer. If your hikes involve travel that's more vertical than horizontal, you need dedicated climbing pants.</p><p>Pants built for rock climbing take mobility to an extreme to account for the physical feats you perform every time your feet leave the ground. They also need to be lightweight and strong enough to hold up to days of being scraped along a rock face. Pockets are less important since you'll likely be carrying nothing more than a chalk bag. Fit is up for debate. Some climbers like loose pants that flow with them, and others like tighter pants that stay out of the way.</p><h3>Convertible pants</h3><p>Laugh it up; we can hear the jokes already. Is the world ready for the onslaught of sex appeal that comes from a grown man turning his pants into shorts? Maybe not, but convertible pants serve a legitimate purpose in the field, whether people admit it or not. If that's your thing, we have you covered (or uncovered, depending on how you wear them).</p><p>Convertible pants are great for climates that experience fluctuating temperatures. If you've ever used your car's heater and air conditioning on the same day, you know the feeling. Plenty of hikes start with frost on the ground and end with blazing sun. Convertible pants let you keep moving without digging a change of clothes out of your pack and carrying more gear than you need to.</p>"
concealed carry holsters,"<h2>Types of concealed carry holsters</h2><p>There are four main categories of concealed carry holsters and they're named after the way in which you wear them. These include Outside the Waistband (OWB), Inside the Waistband (IWB), Appendix Inside the Waistband (AIWB), and shoulder.</p><h3>Outside the waistband (OWB)</h3><p>Outside the Waistband (OWB) is the most traditional way to carry a firearm. You wear an OWB holster on your belt much like a police officer. Since OWB is the standard for open carry, it may sound counterintuitive to use it for concealed carry. Yet, that problem is easily remedied with a jacket or big shirt. Otherwise, OWB is comfortable and gives you quick access to your firearm. It's ideal if you want to be active or carry a full-size handgun.</p><h3>Inside the waistband (IWB)</h3><p>Inside the waistband (IWB) sinks a holster below your belt line and inside your pants. IWB carry makes it insanely easy to conceal a firearm. In fact, the only portion of the gun that sits above the beltline is the pistol grip. Not all IWB holster have drawback. Some are built very well. Still, common issues people raise include discomfort as it might wedge between your belt and body; you might have difficulty accessing your firearm (especially if you don't train); and you might not always be able to reholster. Still, it's the most popular holster for concealed carry.</p><h3>Appendix (AIWB)</h3><p>Appendix carry (AIWB) is another form of inside the waistband carry, but it's so popular that it deserves its own category. It's when the rig sits at the front of your body, often on the left or right of your belt buckle, depending on which is your dominant side. Many prefer appendix carry because it provides more space for a full-size firearm or firearm with accessories. On top of that, it allows you to draw from a very natural position. The drawback, for many, is discomfort, especially if you have a belly. Still, many like it, including your humble author.</p><h3>Shoulder holsters</h3><p>Shoulder holsters sure seem cool and will certainly give you that Miami Vice vibe. They mostly come in handy when you're packing a large handgun. However, they do have several drawbacks. First, it places your firearm just below your armpit, so it's more susceptible to sweat and stink. Second, if you're unaccustomed to wearing a shoulder rig, it can be uncomfortable. And perhaps most importantly, there's a safety concern if you don't train, which is flagging your non-dominant arm when you draw. Still, this niche works well in situations where you're driving for long periods of time or up to your waist in, well, anything.</p>"
rooftop tents,"<h2>Types of rooftop tents</h2><p>Rooftop tents are pretty straightforward, but there are a few key differences that can help you narrow down your search. The most obvious requirement is size. You'll need to find something that fits your needs and your vehicle. Tent construction plays a role too, so pay attention to how each one goes from folded-up to ready-to-use. There are also accessories available to customize your rooftop tent, so factor that in when you're making your initial purchase.</p><p>Soft-shell rooftop tents are basically traditional tents that mount to your car. They're relatively light and easy to set up compared to their hard-shell alternatives. They also breathe well and stay cooler during the summer. On the other hand, they're nowhere near as durable or aerodynamic as a slick, hard-shell tent.</p><p>Having a hard shell on your rooftop tent adds protection against the elements, whether you're parked for the night or blasting down the highway. Although they tend to be heavy, they make up for it to some degree with improved aerodynamics. Let's be honest, any rooftop tent is going to have a negative effect on your fuel economy.</p><p>Both styles are viable options, so do a little digging if you still aren't sure which is right for you.</p><h3>Pop up vs. fold out</h3><p>How your tent goes about its butterfly-like transformation also has an effect on the amount of real estate you're left with. Pop-up tents are a snap to set up because they just extend vertically. When you're ready to go, just collapse the walls and attach the roof to the floor. This means that what you see is what you get in terms of floor space.</p><p>Fold-out tents offer much more floor spaceâ€“â€“think double. This structural origami is more complicated than the alternative and constrains you to soft-shell designs, but you'll benefit from much more space, both in terms of square footage and headroom. If you camp with a group, this is the way to go.</p><h3>Add-ons</h3><p>As is tradition, there's also way more gear to acquire. Annex tents add enclosed space beneath a fold-out tent, which is great for storage or getting dressed. Some are large enough to sleep in, so you can bring more friends as long as someone's willing to call dibs on the bottom bunk. Annexes are generally tent-specific.</p><p>Awnings add protection from the sun and rain. They're usually compatible with a range of rooftop tents, and sometimes can be used on their own. Setting them up is as easy as unrolling them and attaching a pole at the two outer corners. Some even have screens to keep the bugs away.</p>"
waterproof bluetooth speaker,"<h2>Types of waterproof Bluetooth speakers</h2><p>Bluetooth speakers come in so many different forms. Now that this technology is so readily available, you can find an array of waterproof Bluetooth options in every size, style, and even color. But, when you're looking for just the right speaker, you'll want to make sure you think about which type is the best fit for your needs.</p><p>There are three common types of these speakers to choose from: portable, full-size (or stationary), and mounted. Learn more about what each has to offer right here.</p><h3>Portable Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Portable Bluetooth speakers are one of the most popular choices. These handy speakers are both waterproof and designed to be taken anywhere. Compact in size, portable speakers come in all different kinds of compact packages, from slim squares to small circles â€” and some even feature accessories like carabiners, lanyards, or suction cups so you can easily stick them onto your gear or anywhere else.</p><p>The biggest advantage of a portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker is its versatility. You can use these speakers at home, in your garage, or absolutely anywhere outdoors. It's the perfect choice for those who want to take their audio on the go without being weighed down by a bulky device.</p><h3>Full-size Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Full-size Bluetooth speakers, which can also be called stationary speakers, are the exact opposite of portable models. These speakers are larger and heavier, and they're meant to be placed in one spot. Though you can't take them along with you, they deliver more powerful â€” and often more high-quality â€” sound. They're also a really great option for large outdoor spaces, like your backyard.</p><p>If you're looking for waterproof Bluetooth speakers that you'll use in just one place, a full-size speaker is your best bet. Just keep in mind, though, that the speaker will take up space on the ground, on a table, or wherever you choose to put it.</p><h3>Mounted Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Another variety of stationary speaker is a mounted Bluetooth speaker. These aren't super popular, but they are an option for those who want to create whole sound systems in outdoor areas â€” your patio, for example, or your outdoor workspace. These speakers tend to be quite compact in size, and they mount in place to items like walls, patio overhangs, and other indoor or outdoor structures.</p><p>As a more specialized kind of waterproof Bluetooth speakers, mounted models are a bit more limited. However, this style of speaker can create some really great sound quality, and it enables you to easily control your outdoor entertainment right from your smartphone or other Bluetooth-equipped devices.</p>"
camping grills,"<h2>Types of camping grills</h2><p>If you thought buying a grill was as simple as going to the hardware store and picking the right size, you've got another thing coming. Besides picking a side in the great Gas vs. Charcoal War, you'll need to consider how you're going to transport your grill and how much cleanup you're willing to do.</p><h3>Gas grills</h3><p>Gas grills are all about efficiency. Setting them up is as simple as screwing a bottle onto a hose. They heat up almost instantly, burn at a consistent temperature that's effortless to control, and don't make a mess. Propane bottles are also light, compact, and last quite a while, so they're easy to pack. That's why the vast majority of ultralight camp stoves use propane canisters. Propane also powers infrared grills via a heating element that separates the fuel from your food.</p><p>A dividing line appears when flavor comes into the equation. Propane is (arguably) flavorless, which some people prefer. Others want to have the crispy goodness that can only come from charcoal or wood. Those people aren't wrong, but you can't deny the convenience of gas grills.</p><h3>Charcoal and wood grills</h3><p>Wood-burning grills are as old-school as it gets. Charcoal is just a more efficient evolution of the same approach. Both are popular because of the flavor they impart in everything they cook. It's hard to describe and impossible to replicate. For many, it's simply the only option and it's the reason people are willing to shell out hundreds (or thousands) of dollars to put a smoker on their back porch.</p><p>The drawback of wood and charcoal is their relative lack of practicality. Instead of a little propane bottle, you'll need to lug around wood, kindling, and tinder, or a big bag of dirty briquettes. If looking like Loretta Lynn's dad doesn't bother you, the flavor could be worth it.</p><h3>Electric grills</h3><p>The cleanest fuel source is electricity because it doesn't require any combustion at all. Electric grills are popular for indoor use because they plug right into the wall and are safe to use in confined spaces. They also tend to be easy to clean, with non-stick cooking surfaces that can be wiped off once they're cool.</p><p>The lack of a traditional grill grate makes electric grills good for runny foods like bacon, eggs, and pancakes, but some people feel like some of the magic of grilling is lost as a result. There's no smoke and a less-satisfying aroma when you use electricity, and the reliance on an electric outlet can be limiting.</p>"
windproof lighter,"<h2>Types of windproof lighters</h2><p>When you're searching for the perfect windproof lighter, you'll want to consider a few different kinds. There are a number of different options available, from traditional fuel-powered flame lighters to more high-tech flameless options powered by electricity. Here's an overview of three of the most common types of windproof lighters you'll find.</p><h3>Fuel-based lighters</h3><p>Fuel-based lighters are traditional â€” in fact, you're very likely already carrying a fuel-based lighter. But fuel-based windproof lighters are a little different from the average lighter. These lighters typically run on butane, and they emit flames that are supposed to be strong enough to stay lit when wind is blowing. Many fuel-based windproof lighters are also double flame torch lighters, which gives you extra power and double the flame output to withstand wind.</p><p>There are a number of benefits to fuel-based lighters; they're easy to use and they're excellent for lighting campfires and getting grills fired up. They're quite versatile too. However, when they run out of fuel, you're out of firepower. Even with two flames, the wind can still knock out your light source if it's blowing fiercely.</p><h3>Arc or plasma lighters</h3><p>Arc lighters, or plasma lighters, are another windproof option. These lighters don't rely on fuel; instead, they use electricity to generate a ""flame"" that looks nothing like a traditional flame. Arc lighters run on rechargeable batteries, and they use two electrodes at one end to spark fire. With the push of a button, an electrical arc appears between the electrodes, and that arc will light whatever's placed in its path.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of an arc or plasma lighter is the ease of use. You don't have to refill any fuel, and the battery can be recharged via USB like most modern gadgets. There's no flame to worry about â€” when you need to start a fire, the electricity and electrodes will get the job done.</p><h3>Coil lighters</h3><p>Coil lighters, which are also called Tesla coil lighters, are another option. They're pretty similar to arc and plasma lighters, as they don't actually create a flame when used as a lighter. Instead, they use Nikola Tesla's high-voltage, low-current electrical coil to spark a fire. The coil generates a high-heat electric arc. So, with no fuel needed, a coil lighter turns energy into a spark that can withstand even the windiest and most gale-like conditions outdoors.</p><p>Like arc and plasma lighters, coil lighters don't require any fuel. They also recharge via USB, and you'll get hundreds of uses out of a single charge.</p>"
climbing packs,"<h2>Types of climbing packs</h2><p>Climbing backpacks are specialized gear designed to haul loads somewhat comfortably over horizontal terrain and be compact and streamlined enough to provide stability and freedom of movement over vertical terrain.</p><h3>Rock climbing</h3><p>Most rock climbing backpacks are designed for one-day multi-pitch climbing and have volume capacities ranging from 14 to 20 liters. They are intended to carry essential equipment like an extra rope, rack of climbing protection, harness, approach shoes, a headlamp, water, food, rain and warming layers, and a communication device. Generally, they are carried by the person belaying the leader to allow the leader to focus on leading the pitch.</p><p>It's important to get a rock climbing bag that's large enough to stow all of your gear inside of it. Crap dangling off the side tends to come unattached and go dangerously hurtling down the rock face. Climbing packs ride higher off the hips to avoid getting in the way of your climbing harness and most have removable hip belts and emergency whistles built into the sternum straps. Look for packs that are made from more durable materials, as they will be frequently abrading against rock and bombroof haul loops. Crag bags and small haul bags also fit into this category.</p><h3>Alpine mountaineering packs</h3><p>Alpine packs are designed to support adventures over mixed terrain like rock, ice, and snow. They all sport top-loading designs and lean towards much lighter high-tensile fabrics than rock climbing packs to save on overall weight. Alpine packs are also designed to externally carry ice axes via loop or toggle retention systems, crampons in special external pockets or with straps, and most have the ability to carry skis or snowboards. Most will have design considerations for quick access to avalanche safety kits consisting of a shovel, avalanche probe, and snow saw. They'll also have design features for externally carrying ice pickets and ropes. For one to three day mountaineering adventures, look for packs in the 35- to 50-liter range.</p><h3>Mountaineering expedition packs</h3><p>These packs generally sport all the features of alpine mountaineering packs but have much greater internal capacity (ranging from 55 to 110 liters) to accommodate for additional high altitude and cold-weather equipment. Due to the heavier loads, they are designed with more robust and more comfortable suspension systems designed to transfer the weight of the pack to your hips. The back panels are generally designed to provide more ventilation than alpine packs. They'll also have more external attachment points, internal access points, and internal organization pockets.</p>"
emergency radio,"<h2>Types of emergency radios</h2><p>Emergency radios have been around for a long time, and their mission has remained the same: to keep people connected when nature brings its worst. Simple backup radios are still available, but more advanced alternatives provide features that can make life easier and enhance your survival kit. Read up on the different options available to see which is best for your needs and budget.</p><h3>Battery-powered radio receivers</h3><p>In their simplest form, emergency radios just need to establish one-way communication from the outside world in the form of a battery-powered radio receiver. You can pull in your local radio stations without worrying about plugging in your radio, connecting to WiFi, or finding cellular service.</p><p>These old-school radios are simple and reliable, but they aren't fancy. You won't get secondary features like flashlights and USB connections to charge other devices. They aren't programmed to automatically broadcast weather advisories from NOAA. On the other hand, they're extremely affordable and easy to operate. This type of emergency radio is great for locations that don't experience extreme weather but might lose power now and then.</p><h3>Sustainable emergency radios</h3><p>Having an emergency radio is great, but what happens when the batteries die? That's a very real possibility if you live in an area that experiences hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods. Being able to generate power can extend the life of your emergency radio far beyond the point when depleted batteries would leave you stranded.</p><p>This list includes options with solar panels that can top off rechargeable batteries inside the emergency radios. Leave them exposed to sunlight to keep power flowing even when batteries and wall outlets aren't available. When sunlight is insufficient, you can turn a hand crank to manually generate electricity. This isn't the easiest or most efficient way to charge a radio, but it's nice to know that you always have access to power, no matter what.</p><h3>Weather radios</h3><p>While all emergency radios have the ability to deliver broadcast messages to you in times of need, weather radios offer another level of capability by automatically broadcasting messages about local weather events directly from NOAA. With this feature, you can leave your radio plugged in around the clock to receive advanced warnings about extreme weather in your area. When that happens, you'll have a fully-charged battery and time to prepare.</p><p>This feature doesn't come with a noticeable increase in price and is very common in today's emergency radios. We strongly recommend prioritizing it if you frequently experience severe weather.</p>"
headlamps,"<h2>Types of headlamps</h2><p>If you think all headlamps are the same, think again. There are plenty of options out there for all kinds of uses and budgets. We found headlamps designed for everyday practicality, tactical operations, and extreme sports. Before you add one to your cart, make sure you know the basics and can make an informed decision on what's right for you.</p><h3>Everyday</h3><p>Basic headlamps are designed to get the job done without spending a lot of money. They're affordable, reasonably capable, and use common batteries that you can find at any gas station or convenience store in a pinch.</p><p>This is a great way to replace whichever tired, old flashlight you're using now. Everyday headlamps are nice to have when you need to do chores after dark or DIY projects around the house. They can also save you from cussing out an unsuspecting child for not shining the flashlight at the right place when you're fixing your car. This kind of headlamp isn't the most advanced, but it's an upgrade over holding a normal flashlight.</p><h3>Camping</h3><p>A good headlamp is one of the best pieces of gear you can add to your camping pack. For starters, it's a lot safer to move around in the dark if your hands are free to move branches and catch yourself if you fall. Once you start putting your tent together and cooking dinner, a headlamp will make a world of difference.</p><p>Camping headlamps typically have multiple output settings so you can choose the right amount of light for the task at hand. Low settings are good for referencing a map or finding something in your pack, and high settings are great for moving safely after the sun goes down. They're usually lightweight and compact, which is important when you're moving on foot. You can also expect some degree of protection against water and impacts.</p><h3>Action sports</h3><p>Extreme sports require extreme gear. You wouldn't bomb down a dusky trail on your mountain bike with one hand holding a flashlight, and you shouldn't strap a substandard headlamp to your helmet either.</p><p>Extreme sports (and I consider tactical operations the most extreme sport) demand the best gear. Headlamps designed for this world come with various color and power settings, rechargeable batteries, and heavy-duty construction. They can burn brighter and longer in harsher environments than other headlamps. As a result, you can expect to pay top-dollar for one of these. That shouldn't dissuade you, though, because these are tools rather than gadgets.</p>"
ballistic glasses,"<h2>Types of ballistic glasses</h2><p>""Ballistic glasses,"" ""eye protection,"" and ""safety glasses"" get tossed around interchangeably and there are some important reasons not to mix them up. A woodshop and an open-faced motorcycle helmet do not present the same hazards. What you deal with on a shooting range and what you face in combat are two very different things. There's great eye pro for all those scenarios, but it isn't one-size-fits-all kind of gear.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for shooting</h3><p>If you found your way here, you probably need ballistic glasses that are tough enough for the international two-way shooting gallery. Eye protection for shooters can be divided into two categories: those built to civilian standards and those built to military standards.</p><p>The civilian ANSO Z87.1-2020 standard requires ballistic glasses to protect your eyes from projectiles in a wide variety of settings. This includes hunting and recreational shooting, but the threats you'll encounter in those activities are nothing compared to the dangers of a hot battlefield. The military's MIL-PRF-31013 standard subjects ballistic glasses to much harsher testing, and that's the standard we used for this gear guide.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for work</h3><p>If you need eye protection for work on a construction site, machine shop, lumber yard, or other dynamic environments, the ANSI standard is more than sufficient. You can open up your options and save a bundle by shopping in this category of eye protection, too.</p><p>These glasses can also serve you perfectly well in recreational shooting sports. You don't need the very toughest eye protection to poke holes in paper or knock down game animals, so you should be in good hands with a pair of ANSI-approved shooting glasses. Just don't bring them to one of Uncle Sam's shooting ranges.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for motorcycling</h3><p>We'd love to believe that every service member is a stone-cold gunslinger, but the reality is that most people shoot once a year to qualifyâ€“â€“if they even do that. It's entirely possible that there are more motorcyclists than serious shooters in the U.S. Military.</p><p>The military requires service members to wear a DOT-approved helmet, but you don't have to wear a full-face helmet. Open-face alternatives are popular, but they aren't the safest type of motorcycle helmet. Aside from leaving your money-maker exposed to asphalt and truck bumpers, they do nothing to protect your eyes. You can upgrade your riding safety with a solid pair of ballistic glasses. Your options range from impact-resistant sunglasses to padded goggles. All of them are better than your reflexes.</p>"
sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of sleeping bags</h2><p>The types of sleeping bags essentially boil down to three categories based on their intended use. If you don't need protection against cold, windy nights, there's no need for anything more than a basic sleeping bag. If you're embarking on a wilderness expedition, you need the best there is. Most people need something in the middle.</p><h3>Basic</h3><p>Entry-level sleeping bags use basic materials and simple designs to keep costs down. Remember the sleeping bag you had as a kid? That's not too different from what we're talking about.</p><p>Basic sleeping bags' rectangular shape is nice and roomy, but it's not very efficient at containing warmth. Padding is also limited, so these are best for temperate climates and indoor use. Materials also tend to be on the inexpensive side and prioritize softness, so don't expect much in the way of breathability. If you're essentially looking for portable bedding, these are the way to go. They're also extremely affordable, so you can outfit the whole family on a limited budget.</p><h3>Three-season</h3><p>Most people in the market for a sleeping bag want gear that can keep them warm and dry on the trail, then pack down to the size of a cantaloupe to fit in the bottom of their pack. It's no wonder, then, that most of the sleeping bags you see here are aimed at doing just that.</p><p>These sleeping bags use high-end synthetic materials that are strong, but light. Their insulation is very good at keeping warmth close to your body while allowing moisture to be wicked away. The mummy shape is common in this category because it's energy-efficient and saves a few ounces compared to a larger, rectangular sleeping bag. Compression sacks make packing up a stress-free affair. Just cram the sleeping bag inside little by little and use the straps to tighten it into a compact ball.</p><h3>Cold-weather</h3><p>Most sleeping bags can handle fairly cold weatherâ€“â€“as cold as most people will encounterâ€“â€“but you'll need something built for the cold when temperatures drop below zero. These hardcore sleeping bags are a game-changer.</p><p>Cold-weather sleeping bags use good insulation and plenty of it. They're noticeably thicker and heavier than other sleeping bags. The outer shell may be extra thick to block out freezing wind, snow, and ice. Because of the expensive materials that go into building each one, cold-weather bags can be extremely expensive. That's ok because they don't just need to keep you comfortable â€” they need to keep you alive.</p>"
camping lanterns,"<h2>Types of camping lanterns</h2><p>Camping can take a lot of different forms, so it stands to reason that camping lanterns are just as varied. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. We're here to make sense of the different power sources, features, and benefits you should consider to narrow down your search for the right one.</p><h3>Battery</h3><p>Most of the camping lanterns out there use electricity to generate light. Electricity is cheap (if not free), efficient, and doesn't produce toxic emissions like traditional fuels. Camping lanterns that use disposable batteries are usually the cheapest, but rechargeable batteries are also available and pay for themselves in the long run.</p><p>Rechargeable batteries are tough to beat because they can be charged from a wall or car outlet, power bank, or solar charger. Many can also be used to charge other devices like your phone, GPS, or two-way radio. In most cases, a camping lantern with a rechargeable battery would be our go-to option. That being said, there are times when something else is a better tool for the job.</p><h3>Solar panels and hand cranks</h3><p>Even if you know you want an electric camping lantern, there may be times when you don't have access to a power source or spare batteries. Extended camping trips, long hikes, and emergency situations can stretch disposable and rechargeable batteries to the point of failure. When that happens, you'll have to generate your own power.</p><p>Two power sources you can count on are the sun and your own body. Camping lanterns that are powered by a built-in solar panel or a hand-crank are a fantastic backup for emergency survival situations. They may take more time and effort to keep charged, but they might be the only light source you can count on.</p><h3>Gas</h3><p>Gas camping lanterns have been popular for ages. We've used them to light our campsites and relied on them during long power outages at home. Gas-powered lanterns can last a very long time and generate tons of light. They're also great for emergency preparedness because the fuel remains stable for a long time and isn't reliant on the grid to stay operational.</p><p>The downside to fuel-burning lanterns is increased risk. While they're generally safe, you will need to use caution to prevent nearby objects from overheating and catching fire. Burning petroleum-based fuel also generates carbon monoxide that can be deadly if allowed to get too concentrated. Proper ventilation is critical to the safe operation of any gas lantern.</p>"
survival watch,"<h2>Types of survival watches</h2><p>Not all survival situations are the same, and it should come as no surprise that the gear they require is just as diverse. When you pick out a survival watch for your survival kit or part of your everyday carry, prioritize the features that matter most to you to get the most bang for your buck.</p><h3>Analog watches</h3><p>The analog watch face is timeless and never goes out of style. It can also be found on most of the survival watches on the market, thanks to its simplicity and enduring appeal. There are designs to satisfy anyone's personal style, and there's a nice variety on this list. Old-school analog watches are stone-simple and inexpensive, while premium options combine analog hands with digital screens to give you the best of both worlds.</p><p>Analog watches can keep up with digital watches in most aspects, but they do have some inherent limitations as a result of having physical hands. That's not a bad thing, it's just something to consider.</p><h3>Digital watches</h3><p>Digital watches offer certain features that purely analog watches just can't. Take advantage of things like 24-hour time, stopwatches, lap timers, multiple alarm clocks, and the ability to flip through information to get what you need, when you need it without cluttering up the small watch face with everything at once.</p><p>All this digital power needs a battery to run, so it's not a bad idea to keep a fresh battery around to give yourself a backup in case of an emergency. Personal preference plays a part in watch selection, too, and some people feel strongly about the choice between digital and analog. Both are viable options, so go with the one that feels right to you.</p><h3>Smart watches</h3><p>One of the strategies embraced by all survivalists is conserving weight and space. Since you'll likely need to carry everything and travel by foot in a survival situation, everything you bring needs to earn its keep. One way to pack a huge amount of power into a small item is with a smartwatch. By combining timekeeping with GPS navigation, health monitoring, and weather instruments, these advanced watches are one of the best assets you can have.</p><p>Keep in mind that this much computing power requires a lot of electricity compared to a traditional watch, so battery life is limited. Solar charging can extend lifespan, but you'll still want to keep an eye on that charge meter.</p>"
gentlemans knife,"<h2>Types of gentleman knives</h2><p>There is a knife for every job, and this subset is no different. Don't strap on a hunting knife under your suit, and don't try to cut a steak with a folding knife. We represented the following categories on this list to make sure you're set up for success in a wide range of scenarios.</p><h3>Folding knives</h3><p>Even distinguished gentlemen need to cut something every now and then, and summoning help from someone who actually prepared isn't a great look. Folding knives afford the practicality you get from any pocket knife without the typical camouflage handles and tactical blades. Instead of features like serrated blades and heavy construction designed to function around deer camp, the knives in this gear guide offer contemporary style and an understated appearance.</p><p>These folding knives would fit right in at a whisky tasting or cigar night. They look great without drawing attention and being flashy. Make one of these part of your big-night-out EDC and we're sure you'll be glad you did.</p><h3>Hunting knives</h3><p>As a category, hunting knives are characterized by fixed blades, robust steel, and usually a length greater than what you'd get from a pocket knife. In spite of the name, they're remarkably capable in a wide range of situations from wilderness survival to cutting into a block of cheese for campfire burgers.</p><p>Lest you think gentlemen aren't interested in such things, some of the best knives we found for this list are fixed-blade hunting knives designed for life in the field. Don't bother babying these, because they're seriously tough and built to work. Odds are, you won't let go until it's time to pass your knife on as a family heirloom.</p><h3>Kitchen knives</h3><p>If you don't know how to cook, you're missing out. Everyone deserves a quality meal, and it's a lot easier to make that happen when you can prepare delicious meals from scratch, all by yourself. Being a good cook is also one of the best party tricks there is. Pick up a new hobby and welcome guests into your home with a freshly-prepared meal.</p><p>When you do, it helps with the ambiance if you aren't hacking away with some plastic-handled knife you got at the grocery store. Invest in a premium chef's knife to see what the fuss is all about. These are pricey items, but if you're a cooking enthusiast, you'll get your money's worth.</p>"
combat boots,"<h2>Types of combat boots</h2><p>Look past the endless array of shapes and colors, and you'll see that combat boots can be neatly divided into a few categories based on their intended use. A few features separate combat boots for climate, activity, and protection. You almost certainly need more than one, and you might own one of each by the time you're done serving.</p><h3>Jungle boots/moon boots</h3><p>Basic combat boots are sometimes referred to as either jungle boots or moon boots, depending on what type of climate they're built for. It's a good idea to own one of each in good condition at all times.</p><p>Jungle boots are thinner, lighter, and uninsulated. They feature large synthetic panels to create airflow and allow your feet to stay cool in warm environments. Open metal eyelets in the arch areas allow water to drain out, should you need to cross a body of water.</p><p>Moon boots are designed for cold weather. Instead of textiles, they use leather and insulation to keep your body heat inside. Thicker soles raise your feet off the ground to protect you from the cold.</p><h3>Running boots</h3><p>Once the U.S. military started emphasizing functional fitness, exercising in combat boots became standard practice across branches. Unfortunately, most combat boots are lousy to run in.</p><p>Running boots are designed for speed. They weigh very little compared to traditional combat boots and feature soles designed for running rather than rucking. If you want to improve your CFT or O-course time, these are sure to help.</p><p>Because they place a premium on lightness, running combat boots don't hold up well under heavy loads. Wearing them on a field exercise with heavy gear can easily pack out the soles and leave your feet aching. I recommend saving these for PT and timed events.</p><h3>Steel-toe boots</h3><p>Most of you probably don't need steel-toe boots, but some of you need them to do your job. Having adequate protection for your feet is critical to staying mission-ready and preserving your long-term health.</p><p>Uniform regs dictate that you can't just roll into work with a pair of Chippewas on your feet (no matter how awesome they are), so you need to find a protective pair of combat boots like the ones on this list.</p><p>Much like running boots, these are job-specific and shouldn't be worn for other activities like field exercises or PT. Keep them in the shop, where they belong.</p>"
american made pocket knives,"<h2>Types of American-made pocket knives</h2><p>There are three main types of pocket knives. Each type of pocket knife offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your pocket knife, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type to best fit your needs. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of the different types of pocket knives before making a decision on your final purchase.</p><h3>Camper</h3><p>The camper pocket knife is also known as the multitool pocket knife. This type of pocket knife is well equipped with a number of different tools, including screwdrivers, can/bottle openers, scissors, pliers, nail files, toothpicks, tweezers, and more. This is by far the most versatile type of pocket knife, especially if you plan on using your pocket knife for several different purposes. Camper pocket knives are available in a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, colors, and price points. If you do decide to purchase a camper knife, make sure that the blade is strong enough and durable enough to fit your individual preferences.</p><h3>Canoe</h3><p>The canoe pocket knife is named after its canoe shape when it is closed. This type of pocket knife includes two blades of different shapes or sizes. The blades collapse on opposite ends, but on the same side of the knife handle. It typically carries both a pen blade and a drop point blade. The pen blade features a thin narrow blade, while the drop point blade has a straight spine until the very tip of the blade. Canoe pocket knives are generally safe to use, and they can safely fit in your pocket for everyday use or for use while on outdoor trips.</p><h3>Pen</h3><p>Pen pocket knives are one of the oldest types of knives. This type of pocket knife was named after the type of pen that needs to be dipped into a container of ink, typically a quill pen. The pen knife includes a thin, narrow blade with a sleek tip that closely resembled the famous ink and quill combination pen. This type of pocket knife is extremely comfortable, but it can be slightly larger than some of the other types of pocket knives. It is available to purchase in a variety of different price options, depending on the construction quality and design.</p>"
stainless steel cookware,"<h2>Types of stainless steel cookware</h2><p>In addition to the benefits of stainless steel, some cookware incorporates additional features to stand out from the crowd. Which is best for you will depend on your cooking (and cleaning) preferences.</p><h3>Purely stainless steel</h3><p>Stainless steel is so well-suited for cooking that you don't have to complicate the formula to get great cookware. It's conductive, consistent, easy to clean, and tougher than nails. High-end cookware is built to be hefty for better heat distribution.</p><p>Without any other materials, all-stainless steel cookware is as durable as it gets. Use metal spoons and spatulas. Scrub away without worrying about scratches. Throw it in the dishwasher. This style of cookware makes cooking a delight and cleanup a breeze.</p><p>You can find this type of stainless steel cookware at a range of prices, and there are even options designed for outdoor use.</p><h3>Additional metals</h3><p>As good as stainless steel is, some cooks prefer other metals that distribute heat from the stove to the rest of the pot or pan quickly, so you can get cooking in less time. Some stainless steel cookware is designed with an aluminum or copper base to get the best of both worlds. These more conductive metals are only present on the bottom.</p><p>While aluminum and copper are superior heat conductors, they are also softer. That means they scratch easily, so you'll need to be more careful with them. Copper is also very susceptible to discoloration, so you'll need to scour it frequently to keep it looking its best. Over time, you can actually wear all the way through.</p><p>Weigh the advantages and disadvantages to pick what's best for you.</p><h3>Coatings</h3><p>Stainless steel is easy to clean, but non-stick coatings are just about effortless. Some stainless steel pots and pans incorporate these slick coatings so you can spend more time enjoying your meal and less time side-eying the cheese that's hardening to your cookware. If you tend to cook dishes that are hard to clean up, a non-stick coating could be for you.</p><p>Remember that these coatings are not as durable as stainless steel. They do lose efficacy over time and can be easily scratched. To get the most out of a non-stick coated surface, avoid using metal spoons and spatulas. Wash carefully with a soft sponge. Even though these surfaces are somewhat delicate, they can last years if taken care of properly.</p>"
indoor cycling bikes,"<h2>Types of indoor cycling bikes</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Originally, indoor cycling was designed to provide a similar workout to what you'd get from a road bike without leaving the house or gym. As you increase your budget, you'll get access to more adjustable features, like seats and handlebars, and higher-end components, like pedals and drivetrains.</p><p>We include upright and recumbent bikes in this category. All forms of traditional spin bikes can provide you with a good workout at a fairly reasonable price, but some are better than others. Yes, sitting on a cushy seat with a backrest is more comfortable than being perched on a skinny bicycle seat, but it's not the best way to challenge your body. For this guide, we focused our search on machines that mimic a real bicycle.</p><h3>Interactive</h3><p>The next step in the evolution of indoor cycling was the introduction of online classes. Peloton gets the credit for this fitness craze, but competition is catching on and there are several solid alternatives from brands like NordicTrack, Echelon, and Bowflex on the market now. Some even move to simulate hills or lean into a turn.</p><p>The advantage of each of these bikes is a massive catalog of live and on-demand classes, scenic rides, and data-tracking tools. These features come with a monthly subscription fee, but the benefit is undeniable. If you're serious about indoor cycling or training for riding season, this is a fantastic way to go. Just be prepared for extra up-front and recurring costs.</p><h3>Trainers</h3><p>No, we're not talking about people who come into your home and yell at you. Trainers are possibly the oldest indoor cycling tool. These compact devices attach to your bicycle to let you ride it like a stationary bike indoors. The bare-bones approach doesn't offer as many features as other styles and does require you to own a bicycle, but the advantage is getting more seat time on your primary ride.</p><p>There are two styles of trainers. One sits under your bicycle and is powered by the rear tire as you pedal. The other requires removing the rear wheel and chain so you can use a built-in cassette that becomes part of your bike's drivetrain. Both styles have advantages and disadvantages, and which you choose will ultimately come down to personal preference. We chose a wheel-on style for this guide because of its ease of use.</p>"
heated gloves,"<h2>Types of heated gloves</h2><p>You wouldn't wear gardening gloves to shred the gnar at your local ski area and you wouldn't try to drive to work wearing mittens fit for an arctic exploration mission. The same goes for heated gloves; you need to pick the right gear for the job. Don't worry, it isn't complicated and we did the homework for you.</p><h3>All-purpose heated gloves</h3><p>Why are you shopping for heated gloves in the first place? If your reasoning is that your hands are always cold, you need a glove that's comfortable doing everyday tasks like driving to work and running errands. Rugged, waterproof shells are nice to have but not necessary. You also don't need tons of insulation and a long-lasting battery.</p><p>The good news is that there are plenty of heated gloves that will do what you need them to do for a reasonable price. We found some great options for everyday use that barely crack the $100 barrier. In the world of heated gloves, that's pretty good.</p><h3>Specialized heated gloves</h3><p>If you have more specific plans for your heated gloves, you'll need to pick something that's up to the challenge. We found a few options that are great for skiing and snowboarding, hunting, and riding motorcycles. All of these provide capabilities beyond what basic heated gloves can offer.</p><p>These specialized gloves are designed with a specific activity in mind. Hunting gear needs to be camouflaged. Motorcycle gloves can't interfere with feeling the bike's controls. Winter sports require gloves that minimize hot chocolate breaks in the lodge. In any case, there's probably something out there for you if you know where to look.</p><h3>Heated liners</h3><p>Heated liners are ideal for people who plan on doing a lot of different things with their heated gloves. Liners slip into other gloves, mittens, or shells to make your battery-powered warmth more versatile. We found a great option from Hestra that you'll want to take everywhere you go.</p><p>The downside of heated liners is that they aren't meant to be worn alone. They offer little to no protection against water and wind, and they might even be damaged if you get them wet. You could probably get away with wearing them in the car or around town when the weather is cooperative, but most of the time you'll need to pair them with an appropriate shell.</p>"
rechargeable flashlights,"<h2>Types of rechargeable flashlights</h2><p>Flashlights come in many different forms, and that doesn't change just because the power source became reusable. The difference between different types of rechargeable flashlights starts with the intended use. When we put this list together, we made a point to represent the most popular styles of flashlight and the background information to make informed decisions about them.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>Most flashlights can probably fall into the everyday carry category. This is a pretty broad term, and modern flashlights pack so much power into a small size that most of the options on this list could reasonably be carried as part of your EDC.</p><p>To qualify as an EDC item, we think a flashlight needs to be portable, reliable, and easy to use. We're not fans of throwing money away on cheap gear that's likely to break, so anything that's going to recommend our endorsement for EDC duty needs to be durable and high-performing. That means build quality, lumen output, and features all get put under the microscope.</p><h3>Headlamps</h3><p>There are certainly times when holding a flashlight in your hand isn't ideal. Headlamps are a great way to get work done in the dark, whether you're doing home repairs in the attic or pitching a tent after a long day of hiking. Rechargeable options eliminate the need to carry batteries around at work or on the trail, and they can even be charged up using a solar bank.</p><p>Generally speaking, the activities that call for a headlamp aren't particularly gentle on gear. We prefer headlamps that can withstand drops, harsh temperatures, and at least some amount of water. If you want to really nerd out, check out our headlamp-specific gear guide.</p><h3>Searchlights</h3><p>Searchlights are the heavy-duty workhorse of this group. They house enough power to blast through the darkness with the kind of brightness you'd get from your car's high beams. Considering the times you'd need to use one of these behemoths, we only considered options that are rugged enough to join into a search party during an emergency.</p><p>A byproduct of all the power is size. Searchlights are much larger and heavier than other flashlights and should be kept in your home or vehicle rather than a hiking pack or bug out bag. They're not very practical for day-to-day use, but when you need one, you need it badly.</p>"
compact binoculars,"<h2>Types of compact binoculars</h2><p>Binoculars are built for a range of uses, and the same goes for compact binoculars. Before you pull the trigger on your next pair, make sure the positive reviews you see online are applicable to how you plan on using a set of binoculars. Allow us to hit the high points so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Sporting</h3><p>Lots of people like to bring binoculars to sporting events and concerts. It can be nice to have a magnified view of the action, especially when you're in a large stadium that makes a massive screen look like a thumbnail. They're also popular for checking in on a birdfeeder from a nearby window. These compact binoculars prioritize lightness and affordability.</p><p>Because sporting binoculars are used in very controlled environments, they don't need to be particularly durable. Manufacturers reduce costs by eliminating protection against water, dust, and extreme temperatures. We wouldn't recommend these binoculars unless you have no plans to use them in austere environments.</p><h3>Birdwatching</h3><p>Birdwatching is serious business. Differentiating between similar species from a distance requires realistic colors and crisp lines. In fact, some of the best resources for researching binoculars can be found on sites dedicated to birdwatching.</p><p>The binoculars built for birders are generally high-quality items that provide excellent views and can be adjusted to a wide range of eyes, with or without glasses. They're relatively durable and feel right at home in the forest or sightseeing in a new city. They also make a great entry point for people looking for their first pair of quality binoculars because of their balance between price and features.</p><h3>Hunting</h3><p>Binoculars intended for hunting are held to a higher standard than most. That's because hunters encounter severe weather, harsh terrain, and limits on the amount of gear they can carry. A clear view can also spot the difference between a trophy animal and an immature buck that needs a year or two to grow.</p><p>Hunting binoculars are also great for tactical use. Lenses are built from high-quality glass and receive several coatings to protect against fog, glare, and scratches. The air inside hunting binoculars is typically purged with nitrogen to prevent internal fogging. Rubber seals keep out water and dust that can ruin a pair of binoculars. Durable rubber exteriors provide improved grip and protect against impacts.</p>"
zoom binoculars,"<h2>Types of zoom binoculars</h2><p>Zoom binoculars are valuable assets in the field, but they aren't all created equal and they don't all work the same way. What excels in one type of situation might not work in another. Before you spend your hard-earned money on a pair of variable-power binoculars, let us walk you through your options to help you make an informed decision.</p><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Traditional binoculars have been around for ages, and they're just as useful today as they have ever been. By essentially connecting two tiny telescopes, manufacturers let you see further than you could with the naked eye, but still retain depth perception by using both eyes. Adjustments typically include controls for width, focus, and eye relief. If you see black rings or blurry images through your binoculars, the fix is as simple as twisting a few knobs.</p><p>Most high-end binoculars use a traditional setup. This causes them to be relatively large and heavy, but many people find the optical clarity worthwhile.</p><h3>Compact</h3><p>As good as traditional binoculars are, sometimes you need a smaller, lighter alternative. If you weigh your pack and consider every ounce of gear, saving a little weight here and there matters. If you're out on a hunt and have rifle optics available to you as well, maybe a small pair of binoculars that doesn't get in the way is what you want.</p><p>Compact binoculars use a small unibody construction that not only reduces size and weight, but avoids opportunities to get binocular tubes snagged on your gear or nearby branches. They generally have lower power magnification and smaller-diameter objective lenses as a result.</p><h3>Night vision</h3><p>Just because the sun goes down doesn't mean you have to give up the power of sight. Night vision capability is getting increasingly affordable and we support your endeavor to own the night yourself.</p><p>There's more to seeing at night than big objective lenses; to truly light up the night, you need actual night vision technology. How does that work? Three easy steps: light enters the device, magic happens, and you can see in the dark. Different devices use different types of magic, but you get the idea. Even if you can't get your hands on military-grade optics, you can still purchase infrared technology and zoom capability. Best of all, they're not that noticeable on your face.</p>"
led flashlight,"<h2>Types of LED flashlights</h2><p>There are three main types of LED flashlights. Each type of flashlight offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your LED flashlight, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type of flashlight to best fit your needs. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of the different types of LED flashlights before making a decision on your final purchase.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>EDC LED flashlights, or everyday carry LED flashlights, are the most budget-friendly and portable type of LED flashlight. This type of LED flashlight is quite rugged, reliable, and it makes a perfect option for daily use around your home. These flashlights are ideal for tight spaces and working on any projects in your home. EDC flashlights also make a great emergency option, so it is a great idea to store one in your home or vehicle in case you need it.</p><h3>Rechargeable</h3><p>Rechargeable LED flashlights may be the most popular and most commonly found option on the market today. This type of LED flashlight typically includes a built-in lithium ion battery and a USB cable that can be charged via any outlet, vehicle cigarette lighter, or your personal laptop. Rechargeable LED flashlights are available in a variety of sizes, ranging from compact, portable options to large, lantern-style lights. Make sure to check the lifespan of your flashlight on a full battery charge before heading out on a long trip with no access to a charging port. It may be a good idea to carry a spare battery with you with this type of LED flashlight.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tactical LED flashlights are best associated with law enforcement, military, or other special force groups. This type of LED flashlight is usually the most expensive due to the material that it is made from. Tactical LED flashlights are typically made from a high-quality, military-grade aluminum alloy or heavy-duty stainless steel. Many models are shock-resistant and completely waterproof, designed to withstand drops from a high distance and for use underwater. If you will be using your LED flashlight in inclement weather or in high-risk settings like construction zones, this type of flashlight makes a great option even though it is priced at a premium.</p>"
tritium watches,"<h2>Types of tritium watches</h2><p>Tritium watches are popular for good reason, and there are types and styles for just about any occasion. Tactical tritium watches are worthy of nighttime combat operations. Formal tritium watches look fantastic at a club or paired with a suit and tie. Dive watches are backed by breathtaking precision. We wouldn't be surprised if your first purchase becomes the beginning of a collection.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tritium has long been a staple in the world of tactical gear. It's used in lensatic compasses to aid in night land navigation. Firearms have incorporated tritium into their night sights for decades. It only makes sense that you'd want this technology in your watch.</p><p>Tritium is placed into watches in the form of tiny vials, or tubes, rather than being painted on in a liquid form. With vials marking the hands and face, you can easily keep track of time without lighting up a digital screen or giving away your position with a flashlight. Tritium is also compatible with night vision optics.</p><h3>Formal</h3><p>Just because you want the practicality of a watch face that's visible at night doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to watches designed for a combat zone. Formal tritium watches add luminous technology to stylish timepieces fit for a night on the town. Careful design integrates luminous vials into timeless watch faces beautifully.</p><p>Popular brands like Invicta offer watches that look as great as they perform. Not only can you class up an outfit with a gold or silver watch, but you can also take a midnight swim without worrying about damaging it. That's perfect for all those black-tie affairs (or beach barbeques) you go to.</p><h3>Dive</h3><p>Dive watches are intended for extensive use underwater and are held to a higher standard than other watches. Because of the added water pressure experienced at depth, these watches must adhere to incredibly strict quality standards to prevent malfunction. Divers also expect practical design cues like tritium and large numerals that are easy to read in conditions with poor visibility.</p><p>Because of this build quality, dive watches have also evolved into a bit of a status symbol. Even collectors who never intend to dive appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into a good dive watch and are willing to pay to own one.</p>"
gun cleaning kits,"<h2>Types of gun cleaning kits</h2><p>Gun cleaning kits come in all shapes and sizes, and shopping for one can be a bit overwhelming if you're new to the shooting world. As a general rule, there are two main types of gun cleaning kits: push-through and pull-through. Each has its unique strengths and weaknesses, so make sure you know what you need before you (legally) take possession of a new gun cleaning kit.</p><h3>Push-through</h3><p>The push-through gun cleaning kits are the most traditional setup and rely on a metal (steel, aluminum, brass, etc.) or synthetic (i.e., carbon fiber) cleaning rod to move various cleaning heads up and down the barrel. Often, these rods break down into multiple pieces to make storage easier and include a patch holder and at least one bore brush. (Other cleaning heads, such as mops, chamber brushes, and cleaning jags, usually are available for individual purchase.)</p><p>These kits require the user to remove the bolt or barrel from their gun in order to run brushes and other cleaning heads from the breach to the muzzle in order to prevent fouling, dirt, and other contaminants from collecting in and around the action, trigger, and magazine well. While it is possible to run the head in the opposite direction, make sure to use a muzzle guard to preserve the accuracy and position your gun so that contaminants fall away from your gun's internals.</p><h3>Pull-through</h3><p>While traditional push-through gun cleaning kits rely on a metal rod to push cleaning heads through the barrel, pull-through kits operate more like a ripcord and fall into one of two categories: cleaning cable or bore snake kits. Both operate similarly, but the devil is in the details.</p><p>Pull-through cable cleaning kits operate similarly to rod-based kits. They include a pull handle and an attachment point to accept screw-on cleaning heads. They may also include multiple screw-together cables for cleaning longer barrels, again mimicking cleaning rods.</p><p>On the other hand, bore snakes combine a thick, weighted pull cord, mop, and bore brush into a single component to streamline the cleaning process. They fit into much smaller packages than traditional cleaning kits, making them incredibly handy, although since they lack interchangeable cleaning heads, a single bore snake is limited to a single bore size.</p>"
fishing backpacks,"<h2>Types of fishing backpacks</h2><h3>Tackle backpack</h3><p>A tackle backpack is a fishing backpack built with the primary function of holding tackle trays of various sizes. For the purpose of this review, I based all of my criteria on the #3600 tray size, which is a medium-size tackle tray and fairly common. Many of the tackle backpacks are characterized by dividable inner chambers with upper and lower access flaps. This feature allows the user to keep their tackle trays stacked and separated in a separate compartment and not mixed in with other gear or camping necessities. Most tackle backpacks offer a generous amount of side pockets for additional gear such as line spools, spare reels, and all the other bits and pieces that accumulate with years of fishing.</p><h3>Sling backpack</h3><p>Geared for the more mobile fisherman, sling backpacks allow an angler to stay on the move. A tackle backpack is likely to be set down along the shore or in a boat, but the sling backpacks are usually meant for long-term wear and are geared toward fishermen who are constantly changing location, looking for that magical spot where all the fish are biting. Most sling backpacks are equipped to either be worn over the back, or strapped across the fisherman's front. The single strap allows the fisherman to easily slide the bag from their back to their chest, granting easy access to tackle without ever having to leave the water.</p><h3>Hip back</h3><p>Whoever said fanny packs went out of style never talked to a fisherman. Hip packs, like sling packs, are meant for constant wear, allowing the fisherman access to most of his vital gear without ever having to leave his position.</p><h3>Chest pack</h3><p>Generally geared to fly fishermen, chest packs are another great way to keep your gear accessible without having to trudge back into shore. Chest rigs tend to be a bit smaller than sling backpacks and hip packs in the interest of preserving range of motion during casting. It's for this reason that chest packs are usually marketed more toward fly fishermen, who generally require less tackle and equipment needs. If you're one to wade into deep water chasing trout, a chest pack is a good idea to keep your tackle high and dry.</p>"
compasses,"<h2>Types of compasses</h2><h3>Baseplate compass</h3><p>The baseplate compass is the most common type of compass today. It allows for easy reading of the map because the baseplate is usually made of clear plastic with orienting arrows and lines throughout to make it easier to align the compass with your map and plot points. The baseplate usually includes an integrated magnifier to help read small print and terrain features on a map.</p><h3>Lensatic compass</h3><p>The lensatic compass is a type of sighting compass. The lensatic compass has a small magnifying lens on the near side â€” in fact, the term lensatic comes from the presence of this lens. The lensatic compass is commonly used similarly to a baseplate compass â€“â€” level hold and eyeball the degrees â€” but they are designed to be used for more precision sighting. The cover of a lensatic compass has a long, vertical notch that lines up with the bezel and the magnifying lens to allow the user to get a very specific and precise directional alignment.</p><h3>Mirror compass</h3><p>A mirror compass has a lid that goes over the face of the compass. The underside of the lid has a mirror with a long, vertical notch. This allows the user to view their landmark through the notch while using the mirror to accurately view the magnetic needle and bezel. The result can be a more accurate azimuth towards your destination.</p><h3>Global compass</h3><p>A global compass is a compass that can be used in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This is particularly useful to those who travel extensively, like the ski bums I met in Bariloche, Argentina, who fled the northern hemisphere in the summer to ski in the Andes Mountains when the seasons reverse.</p><h3>Thumb compass</h3><p>Thumb compasses are small compasses designed to be attached to the thumb for more rapid bearings while on the move. They are not commonly used as a primary navigation device, but as a readily accessible backup. They help competitors stay on course without stopping to acquire their azimuth with the more traditional compass. They are similar to the small compass attachments you can attach to your watch strap or embed in the top of your wooden walking stick.</p>"
survival radios,"<h2>Types of survival radios</h2><p>Technically, any radio can become a survival radio in a pinch. As long as you have a radio that can pick up AM and FM broadcast signals, you'll be able to tune in to broadcasts. But when you're focused on survival, having an actual survival radio â€” one that's equipped with the tools and radio wavelengths you need in an emergency â€” is even more important.</p><p>Survival radios share many of the same features and capabilities. But there are two different types of these radios: AM/FM and weather alert. Each specific type offers its own benefits and disadvantages. Read on to discover which is the best fit for your emergency kit.</p><h3>AM/FM survival radios</h3><p>AM/FM survival radios, which are also often called simply emergency radios, are able to pick up AM and FM radio frequencies. They'll keep you informed on the latest information when you're in a developing situation, allowing you to access both local radio stations and those that are farther away. This kind of emergency radio is typically used when the power goes out â€” so, these radios don't always have a wealth of extra features.</p><p>Your average AM/FM survival radio features multiple power options, like a hand crank, solar charging, and traditional wall outlet or battery power. This ensures you'll be able to use your radio even when your access to electricity is nonexistent. These radios can also include survival extras, like a built-in flashlight, an emergency alert sound, and extra battery power.</p><h3>Weather alert survival radios</h3><p>A weather alert survival radio is a more specialized kind of emergency device. These radios are able to broadcast alerts from NOAA, giving you critical information about weather in your area. You can even fine-tune your alerts if you choose a weather alert radio that includes Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) capability. Many weather alert models also allow you to tune in to local radio stations for updates and alerts beyond the weather. This versatility can be especially handy in a survival situation.</p><p>Additionally, these radios often include all of the same features of AM/FM survival radios. You'll find options with flashlights, emergency lights or alerts, backup battery power, and more.</p>"
range bags,"<h2>Types of range bags</h2><p>You wouldn't bring a rifle to shoot skeet and you wouldn't draw a pistol from the 500-yard line, so don't bother with the wrong type of range bag, either. Every range bag is designed for a specific type of shooting, so make sure you buy one that's right for you.</p><h3>Soft cases</h3><p>The most accessible range bags are essentially soft pistol cases with dedicated storage for small items like magazines, earplugs, and maybe a very compact cleaning kit. They're great for a pistol session at a range where targets are provided but fall short when you start adding multiple firearms and larger items.</p><p>Compared to hard cases, these are lighter, more affordable, and typically accommodate MOLLE attachments. The drawback is that soft cases don't offer the same level of protection as hard cases. They leave your gear susceptible to impacts and are less secure than a locked hard case.</p><h3>Backpacks</h3><p>We've used backpacks since grade school, so why not keep the tradition alive? This type of range bag is practical, offers generous amounts of space, and keeps our hands free. They're great for situations where you have separate cases for your firearms or are moving between dispersed firing positions.</p><p>Most backpacks built for the range include easy-access compartments for handguns. Some come with soft cases for individual handguns so you can easily grab the one you want. Storage for long guns is less common, although there are rifle cases that can be worn like a backpack.</p><h3>Duffel bags</h3><p>These are the one-stop-shops of range bags. Throw your ammunition, cleaning gear, ear and eye protection, targets, stapler, extra magazines, range book, and even pistol cases in a duffel, and be on your way. Some even have room for disassembled long guns. If you want to make one purchase and be done with it, this is the style of range bag for you.</p><p>With this much space, it's easy to get carried away and pack more weight than you really want to lug around. Throwing a bunch of weight on one shoulder isn't the most efficient way to distribute weight on your body, so be mindful when you choose your loadout for the day.</p>"
hydration bladders,"<h2>Types of hydration bladders</h2><h3>Durable hydration bladders</h3><p>Since hydration bladders can be known for leaking, it's important to go for a durable model. Lucky for us, most of the top-of-the-line models today are both reliable and affordable. Their thick plastic materials can handle being pressed against a hiker's back or squished in a pack, without the plastic seams bursting.</p><p>Options like the Platypus Big Zip EVO Reservoir, the Source Outdoor Widepac, and the CamelBak Crux Reservoir are all known to be long-lasting and puncture-resistant. The HydraPak HydraSleeve is perhaps the most durable option on this list, as it can even be strapped on to the outside of a pack without getting damaged.</p><h3>Ultralight hydration bladders</h3><p>Hydration bladders most frequently weigh between five and 10 ounces, and while that may not seem like a large range, when you're a marathon runner, cutting a few ounces can make a difference. Ultralight bladders can also be good for backpackers, skiers, or anyone else looking for a lightweight option. Our pick for lightweight adventures is the Hydrapak Shape-Shift Reservoir, which weighs only 5.40 ounces, though it does sacrifice some durability to cut those few ounces.</p><p>Keep in mind that, while you can lose a few ounces in your bladder, the water it's carrying is the weight you'll notice. If you are looking to cut down on weight, try only keeping a liter or two of water in your bladder and filling up every couple miles, if you have water sources available.</p><h3>Insulated hydration bladders</h3><p>Have you ever heard someone complain about taking a hydration bladder snowmobiling or skiing, only to have the water freeze before being able to drink any? I sure have, and that's why I find insulated bladders so useful. In addition to keeping your water from freezing, these bladders will keep your beverage ice cold on a hot summer day.</p><p>Our pick for the best insulated hydration bladder is the HydraPak HydraSleeve, which provides extreme versatility when it comes to using it for different activities. If you go with another option on our list, most brands sell insulated tubes separately, which you can sub out for your bladder's normal tube if need be.</p>"
rugged smartwatch,"<h2>Types of rugged smartwatches</h2><p>Smartwatches all seem kind of the same when you first start shopping for one. However, when it comes to rugged smartwatches, you'll want to pay close attention to even the little differences between various products. Some smartwatches work like the popular non-rugged kinds you know well â€” like the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch. Others are specifically built with functionality and features meant for rugged environments or uses.</p><p>There are two primary types of rugged smartwatches available: traditional smartphone smartwatches and fitness tracker smartwatches. Learn more about what each kind can offer below.</p><h3>Smartphone smartwatches</h3><p>Smartphone smartwatches are more commonly just called smartwatches. These watches are loaded with features. They connect to your smartphone, and they can actually replace your phone altogether when you want to leave your phone behind. You can use your smartphone to make or answer calls, send and receive text messages, open apps, and so much more. These styles of rugged smartwatches also include fitness tracking, keeping record of everything from your steps to your heart rate and more.</p><p>Smartphone smartwatches are the most well-rounded and versatile option. The only downside is that many traditional smartphone smartwatches aren't actually rugged. It's important to look at the materials and whether or not a watch is tested against drops, impacts, water, dust, and harsh wear to determine if it's really rugged.</p><h3>Fitness tracker smartwatches</h3><p>The alternative to a smartphone smartwatch is a fitness tracker watch. These smartwatches come in so many different styles, from simple fitness trackers that include watch functionality to wholly comprehensive fitness trackers with additional apps. However, most commonly, fitness tracker smartwatches are focused on capturing metrics like heart rate, steps, workouts or activity level, and GPS.</p><p>When you're looking for a rugged fitness tracker smartwatch, you can find some that are made for harsh environments or tough wear and tear. These often include additional features you need in tactical settings, like location data, GPS tracking, and altimeters for example. It's a good idea to look for fitness tracker smartwatches that can do more than just track your steps if you're hoping to get the most versatility and value.</p>"
tactical sunglasses,"<h2>Types of tactical sunglasses</h2><h3>Interchangeable lens kit</h3><p>Beyond the basic single-lens offerings on today's market, you will fit a number of tactical sunglasses kits which come with a collection of interchangeable lenses and a single pair of frames. Most often, these kits will include a non-polarized set of lenses without any polarization and one or two additional pairs of lenses: clear and/or low-light (yellow, amber, copper, etc.). Oftentimes, replacement lenses are available from the manufacturer, so if glare is an issue, you can always supplement your kit with a new pair of polarized lenses.</p><h3>Prescription sunglasses</h3><p>Some of the best tactical operators in the world couldn't hit the broadside of a barn without their prescription lenses. Ok, so maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but sometimes prescription tactical sunglasses are an absolute must-have. Sure, there are options that will fit over traditional eyeglasses or you could settle for wearing contacts with regular ol' sunglasses, but let's face it: Tactical environments are not particularly forgiving of either solution. As such, investing in a pair of prescription shades with the ballistic performance to keep you in the fight. The only downside with this solution is the extra cost and the need to order from either the manufacturer or the optician.</p><h3>â€˜Asian fit'</h3><p>The human body is simultaneously uniform and unique, and the same goes for our facial structure. Most standard tactical sunglasses are designed around the dimensions of the average Caucasian face shape, but ballistic shades made to these specs are not well-suited to fit many individuals of East Asian or Pacific Rim heritage. As such, many ethnically Asian or Pacific Islander individuals (and a few others) need a pair of ballistic sunglasses with a proper nose bridge, lens shape, and frame curvature to accommodate their face shape in such a way as to provide adequate protection from both sun and debris. Many brands offer Asian fit sunglasses, although a number of them use different descriptors, such as omni fit, universal fit, or low bridge fit to name a few.

damascus knives,"<h2>Types of Damascus knives</h2><h3>Pattern-welded Damascus steel</h3><p>By far the most common way of making Damascus-style steel, this variant is made by forge-welding at least two dissimilar metals together. After they are forge-welded together, they are folded and welded again repeatedly to form an ingot, drawn out and formed into the basic shape of the blade, heat-treated, tempered, and ground; The blade is then dipped in acid to patina the blade and bring out the final pattern of the folded layers of steel. Ferric Chloride acid is frequently used, and 1095 and 15N20 are frequent high carbon steel choices for pattern-welded Damascus, due to the high-nickel content of 15N20 making it patina drastically lighter than 1095, which creates strikingly bold patterns.</p><p>The billet is heated, hammered, and folded repeatedly. The distinct patterns on the blade are created by twisting, folding and drawing out the billet. Overall, the process creates a very strong blade, but its durability is due to the steel alloys that are chosen to create the blade. The pattern in damascus steel is only visually revealed once the steel is cleaned, prepared and etched in acid. The two types of steel react differently in the acid oxidation process. One oxidized steel is lighter and the other is darker, only then is the pattern revealed on the surface that is hidden within the steel.</p><h3>Stainless Damascus</h3><p>Depending on the steels/metals used, Damascus steel can be stainless or not. To become a stainless Damascus both steels must have at least 14% chromium. While the most notable advantage to this is a drastic increase in corrosion resistance, there's typically an increase in quality as well, as this is harder to make than pattern-welded Damascus.</p><h3>Damasteel</h3><p>Damasteel is a modern, innovative take on Damascus steel that utilizes particle metallurgy (PM) to produce extremely high quality stainless Damascus that performs very similarly to CPM154 steel, and has drastically less impurities and inclusions than pattern-welded Damascus. It also features improved toughness and edge retention, courtesy of the PM process. This is the most expensive option, but you get what you pay for.</p>"
hunting knives,"<h2>Types of hunting knives</h2><p>Hunting knives encompass a lot of different things, and we spread the love to represent a lot of different styles and tastes on this list. In each case, there's a reason why we chose what we did. Here's a breakdown of which factors you need to consider and some of the information we used to get in the right headspace for this guide.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>Hunting knives have typically used a fixed blade, and that's still true in most cases. Many of the tasks hunting knives are expected to do require a fair amount of force, so being rigid allows them to hold up to the abuse. The lack of any moving parts makes them much stronger than folders.</p><p>In terms of size, fixed-blade knives are generally larger than folding knives. That's fine in this case because hunters don't need to restrict themselves to knives that fit in a pocket. Large blades are useful when setting up a blind, breaking down big game, and doing chores around the campsite.</p><p>We also can't overlook the maintenance our gear requires. Keeping a fixed-blade knife in peak shape is as simple as sharpening, oiling the steel, and maybe rubbing some wax into the handle.</p><h3>Folding</h3><p>The biggest advantage folding knives possess is their compact size. One of our favorites is the Benchmade North Fork, which folds down to a closed length of 3.9 inches. With its slim handle and movable pocket clip, it's a wonderful, high-end EDC or backup to your primary hunting knife.</p><p>No matter what kind of mechanism a folding knife uses, it's never as strong as a solid piece of metal. Folders aren't well-suited to more rigorous tasks like breaking down large game animals.</p><p>All the small moving parts that allow a folding knife to open and close get filled with gunk, too. Using one as a hunting knife will result in sticky blood and all kinds of other nastiness gumming up the works. That requires stripping the knife down to individual components, cleaning each one, and (worst of all) putting it all back together.</p>"
1000 lumen flashlight,"<h2>Types of 1000 lumen flashlights</h2><p>Though all 1000 lumen flashlights will max out at the same light beam intensity, not all are made alike. Most lights rely on LED technology since it is affordable, compact, and longer-lasting than other bulbs on the market. While you can find all sorts of tactical flashlights and even UV models, the types of 1000 lumen flashlights are differentiated by the power source the flashlights use.</p><h3>Rechargeable battery</h3><p>Easily the most common type of 1000 lumen flashlight, most rechargeable battery lights rely on LED chip technology to create the light beam. You can find models that have removable batteries, similar to a double-A setup that you can charge outside the flashlight. These enable you to switch out the batteries. In some cases, the flashlights enable you to use replaceable batteries, too.</p><p>The more popular design for rechargeable flashlights is with a built-in battery. These connect either via a standard or micro-USB (sometimes both). You can charge them on the go or via a wall socket. Generally speaking, the battery life of rechargeable models is superior to the replaceable counterparts. These flashlights are suitable for times when you know you can restore a charge or are certain you will need it only for a minimal amount of time.</p><h3>Replaceable battery</h3><p>While less common nowadays, replaceable battery flashlights have a lot of advantages. Most rely on a trio of triple-A batteries, located in the shaft of the flashlight itself. Though the batteries are more prone to draining quickly on a high charge, they are easier to replace while you are in transit since you can simply pack spares.</p><p>Most of these flashlights are waterproof and highly durable. So long as batteries aren't left in the flashlight for an extended period, the risk of battery acid leakage is nominal. Coming in a lot of different sizes, the majority of these flashlights are compact, ringing in at under six inches long. These flashlights are suited towards emergency preparation (along with spare batteries) since you can always swap out the power source.</p>"
hydration pack,"<h2>Types of hydration packs</h2><p>In order to get the most out of your gear, you need to choose the proper type. Yes, all hydration packs have a main bladder and connecting hose, but that doesn't mean they are all alike. Many work in conjunction with hiking backpacks and make it easier to use a water filter. The first step in finding the best hydration pack is knowing the different types.</p><h3>Hydration backpacks</h3><p>Easily the most common type of hydration pack, this type generally has a large bladder (at least two litres) and a convenient hose. However, unlike more streamlined types of hydration packs, these models are surrounded by a backpack. You can find them in conjunction with tactical backpacks, a good place to look if you need to store a lot of supplies.</p><p>In this category, you can find sleeker models with smaller bladders and more accessible straws. These are ideal for jogging and biking activities since your skin can breathe more easily and you can move around more comfortably. Conversely, larger bags with more substantial bladders are ideal for hiking since they carry more water. All of these should have multiple straps to adjust weight distribution, along with a durable hose and easy-flow valve for on-the-go drinking.</p><h3>Hydration waist packs</h3><p>A less common, but still noteworthy, type of hydration pack is the model which goes around your waist instead of over your shoulders with straps. There are two kinds of these waist packs. The first uses a standard water bottle that connects to a hip belt. It includes a spot to attach a hose so that you can drink on the move.</p><p>The other style of hydration waist pack uses a bladder. Similar to a bottle, the material is more forgiving and takes on the shape of its surroundings. These waist models tend to be less versatile, simply due to the limited capacity. You can't carry as much water, so they only really work for quick jogs or bike rides rather than as survival gear.<br/></p>"
trauma shears,"<h2>Types of trauma shears</h2><p>While trauma shears are themselves a specialized type of scissors, these emergency medical tools have their own unique categories worth noting. The indispensable trauma shear can appear in one of two formats: traditional or multi-tool. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but your tool of choice will depend most heavily on your own specific needs. Either way, though, you can rely on angled blades, guarded tips, and finely-serrated edges to maximize your trauma shear's capabilities.</p><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Despite what the naysayers would have you believe, tradition isn't always a bad thing, and this is especially true with trauma shears. While a non-traditional shear, such as a multi-tool trauma shear, certainly can earn its place in your tool kit, most professional rescuers rely on traditional trauma shears due to their predictability, ease of use, minimal weight, and low cost. For the majority of emergency medical providers, traditional trauma shears are the only way to go.</p><p>For those not already in the know, traditional trauma shears look like funky yet beefy scissors, and the eyes don't lie. Traditional trauma shears break the mold of the traditional scissors form factor, but their odd angles and added girth make safe and speedy emergency care a reality.</p><h3>Multi-tool</h3><p>As you might expect, these trauma shear multi-tools do more than snip through safety belts or slice through denim at the drop of a hat. These multi-tools often pack in features like strap cutters, glass breakers, O2 wrenches, and measurement markings. Best of all, they fold away like a typical knife-oriented multi-tool.</p><p>If space efficiency is your best friend, then a multi-tool trauma shear may be worth your hard-earned cash. Thanks to their increased versatility, they can be an excellent choice for go bags, minimalist emergency kits, or similar uses. Also, compared to most traditional trauma shears, these tools hold an edge MUCH longer, making them a true investment. Of course, the added weight is a tradeoff that may or may not be worth it to you.</p>"
4 person tents,"<h2>Types of 4-person tents</h2><h3>Dome-shaped</h3><p>These types of tents are what most people think of when they think of tents: a shelter with an arch-like structure held up by criss-crossing poles. These options cave in on the sides, often making the tent feel less spacious, but they hold up against heavy winds far better than their cabin-like counterparts.</p><p>These tents vary heavily when it comes to features, though most of the dome-shaped tents listed above feature vestibules to keep gear dry. REI Co-op's classic Base Camp 4 is just one example of this structure. Others include the Kelty Wireless 4 Tent and the Marmot Limestone 4P Tent.</p><h3>Cabin tents</h3><p>Cabin tents â€” known for their nearly vertical walls â€” often offer more room for you and your gear than traditional dome-shaped tents. Some of these options take on an almost rectangular shape, and some still slant out on the sides, while still maintaining their upright shape. These tents also often feature vestibules for gear storage, or they have options to extend the rainfly as an awning using trekking poles. These tents can extend to be over six feet â€” perfect for your lengthy friends.</p><p>This category includes tents such as the REI Co-op Grand Hut 4, as well as the Eureka Copper Canyon LX 4 and the NEMO Wagontop 4 Tent.</p><h3>Ultralight</h3><p>While it's not very common to bring a four-person tent backpacking due to weight considerations, there are plenty of tents on the market that pack down small and can fit as many as four people. The leader in this category is the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL4, which can pack down to weigh as little as five pounds on the trail.</p><p>These tents are built to withstand extreme conditions, while using as little material as possible. Ultralight options are often not as comfortable and spacious as other options, so if you are seeking a tent for more luxurious car camping, look towards the larger dome-like and cabin tents.</p>"
10x42 binoculars,"<h2>Types of 10Ã—42 binoculars</h2><p>When it comes to choosing the right pair of 10Ã—42 binoculars, you'll have two primary options. These binoculars come with either a roof prism or Porro prism setup. While these two different types might look almost identical at first glance, the prism option you choose will determine important details, like the weight, capability, and light intake of your binoculars. To decide which is the best fit for you, keep reading to learn about each specific kind.</p><h3>Roof prism</h3><p>Roof prism binoculars feature internal prisms that closely overlap, keeping them tightly-knit and slimmer in shape. Physically, the objective lenses line up directly with the eyepieces for a truly straight-line point of view. This makes roof prism 10Ã—42 binoculars slimmer as a result â€” they're more streamlined and less bulky than other kinds of binoculars. They also tend to be lighter in weight and more compact in size overall.</p><p>Roof prism binoculars are typically more rugged and durable. Their inner workings may be a bit more complex due to their overlapping prisms, but these binoculars are light and easy to hold under even the roughest conditions. However, they're also often more expensive.</p><h3>Porro prism</h3><p>Porro prism binoculars are the ""original"" style of binoculars. Created as the first modern binocular, it's the kind that most people still purchase today. Inside each pair, prisms are placed in a zig-zag array that's meant to offer better clarity and more three-dimensional images even from great distances. These binoculars tend to be the best choice for wider, larger fields of view; they can do more and offer better images from very far away.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks that come with choosing a pair of Porro prism binoculars. These binoculars are bigger, heavier, and bulkier than their competitors. They aren't as easy to hold or as light to carry over long periods of time. However, if you're all about performance and high-quality images, then Porro makes for the perfect choice.</p>"
gaiter mask,"<h2>Types of gaiter masks</h2><p>There are three main types of gaiter masks. Each type of mask offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your gaiter mask, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type of gaiter mask to best fit your needs. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of the different types of masks before making your final purchase.</p><h3>Running</h3><p>Running gaiter masks are typically the most lightweight and made from extremely breathable material. Even though they are the lightest option, make sure that the material will be protective enough. A quality running mask will typically be UV-resistant, made from a material with a UPF rating to protect you from the sun's harmful rays while outdoors. This type of gaiter mask is often made from a moisture-wicking technology, designed to keep you cool while running, hiking, climbing, backpacking, and more.</p><h3>Fishing</h3><p>Fishing gaiter masks are another popular type of gaiter mask. This type of mask is similar to a running mask, but the material usually features the highest UPF rating, to block out most of the sun's harmful rays while fishing throughout the day. Fishing gaiter masks come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and design patterns. They are typically waterproof, designed to keep you dry in the case of any splashes while fishing rivers, lakes, tributaries, and streams.</p><h3>Skiing</h3><p>Skiing gaiter masks are specifically designed for use in the coldest climates and hazardous weather conditions. This type of mask is typically the most expensive because it is built from the heaviest material, such as wool or thick cotton fabric. In addition to skiing, this type of gaiter mask makes a great option for snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, biking, ATV riding, and UTV riding. If you are participating in outdoor activities in warmer weather conditions, you may want to consider one of the other types of gaiter masks.</p>"
safety glasses,"<h2>Types of safety glasses</h2><h3>Prescription-friendly</h3><p>If you wear prescription glasses on any sort of a regular basis, you understand the pain and frustration of finding safety glasses that fit over your glasses while still providing proper protection from flying debris, dripping oil, and other hazards. Thankfully, there are a number of designs for safety glasses that were made with you in mind.</p><h3>Sunglasses</h3><p>Landscapers and countless other outdoor professionals need to protect themselves from both visible and invisible threats to their eyesight. Enter safety sunglasses. These safety glasses provide the same protection one would expect from traditional safety glasses with the added bonus of tinted lenses designed to protect against the assault of the sun. Whether you need simple UVA and UVB protection or anti-glare polarization on top of ultraviolet protection, there are plenty of options available on today's market.</p><h3>Ballistic</h3><p>Ballistic safety glasses (a.k.a. shooting glasses) take traditional safety glasses and add in a few features you would expect on the range. Sometimes, the only difference between basic and ballistic safety glasses is a Z87+ rating rather than the baseline Z87. Shooting glasses often come in a variety of lens colors to accommodate different lighting situations with some models offering interchangeable lenses to decrease the number of frames you need to store in your range bag. For those planning to head downrange, top-end offerings include ballistic-rated frames, replacing basic plastics with beefed-up polymers designed to withstand some serious flying debris.</p><h3>Anti-particle</h3><p>Small, airborne particles can be a significant concern for some individuals, but anti-particle safety glasses can save the day. An intermediate option between basic safety glasses and full-fledged safety goggles, anti-particle safety glasses use frame gaskets, usually made with closed-cell foam, to create a tight seal between the already minimal space between the frame and your face. Often, these gaskets will include ridges with very small gaps on the face-side of the gasket in order to minimize the inevitable fogging that comes with a complete seal.</p>"
down jackets,"<h2>Types of down hackets</h2><p>There are a bajillion different down jackets on the market, and choosing the right one for you can be a bewildering experience. It's best to first think about what you'll use the jacket for before starting your search.</p><h3>Ultralight down jackets</h3><p>When you have to carry everything you need on your back for days over many miles, every ounce counts. Ultralight backpacking down jackets seek to provide the most warmth for the fewest ounces carried. These jackets tend to use the fluffiest down (800 to 1,000 fill) and have very thin 5D to 7D shells that aren't the most durable and require special care when wearing to avoid rips and snags.</p><p>They also have fewer features like chest pockets and adjustment points and tend to be the most expensive due to the high-performance materials used. These jackets generally weigh less than 10 ounces overall and have three to four ounces of down fill. They can be used as outer layers in warmer conditions and mid-layers in colder conditions.</p><h3>Midweight down jackets</h3><p>When you're not obsessed with eliminating every possible gram, you get more options in terms of features and warmth. Most midweight down jackets for backpacking use 600 (less fluffy) to 800 (more fluffy) power fill down and have a hood, two hand warmer pockets, a chest pocket or two, and adjustable hoods and hems. These won't be the absolute lightest jackets, but they're good tradeoffs in terms of warmth, weight, and features. Midweight jackets generally weigh between 12 and 15 ounces overall, with five to six ounces of down fill.</p><h3>Heavyweight down jackets</h3><p>These super warm jackets are designed for cold and windy conditions. They often sport weather-resistant shells, large baffled hoods, and more insulation for true winter conditions. These jackets typically weigh more than 20 ounces overall, with more than eight ounces of down fill, and are designed to keep you warm in the harshest conditions.</p>"
rooftop cargo carriers,"<h2>Types of rooftop cargo carriers</h2><p>There are many designs for carrying cargo on the roof, and the truth is this option is not for everyone. Even more crucial to your decision-making is what you will be carrying and how frequently you'll need to use the box. Let's take a look at these factors so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Hardshell</h3><p>When most people think of roof boxes, a hardshell rooftop cargo carrier is what they picture. They are made from materials or fibers that have been molded or formed into a hard container. The biggest benefit of this type of carrier is that they tend to be the most weatherproof. Because they are formed, it makes storing gear in them easier, and many feature straps to secure small gear when it isn't fully loaded. While most only open from one side, many can open from either side. These styled boxes are slightly more secure than softshell carriers since they can be locked and aren't sliceable.</p><h3>Softshell</h3><p>A softshell carrier is made from a fabric that doesn't maintain its form when empty. This material tends to be treated to weatherproof it, but this isn't a guarantee that your gear will stay dry. Most of these will use zippers and open in a specific way. One advantage is that these can mount easier than hard-shell carriers, but they're not as secure since the fabric could be cut.</p><h3>Open frame/specific frame</h3><p>There are many baskets and specific use cargo carriers out there that are an option. Baskets are frames that mount to your roof and will allow you to carry custom load-outs, but they require webbing or straps to secure the gear into the basket. Examples of specific carriers are rooftop bike racks and ski racks that only carry bikes or skis. These are great options for carrying the specific tool you need, but they don't offer versatility.</p>"
karambit knives,"<h2>Types of karambits</h2><p>Karambits come in many different forms and sizes. No matter what task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, it's probable that you'll be able to find a blade that suits your needs. Whether you're a Kali practitioner or in need of an EDC/utility knife, there are options for you at pretty much every price point.</p><h3>Fixed-blade</h3><p>A fixed blade is any knife with a blade that is ""fixed"" in place, meaning that it doesn't have a pivot and is firmly, immovably attached to the handle. They're essentially the opposite of pocket knives. The blade is always exposed unless it's sheathed. They're simple, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly due to the absence of a confusing locking mechanism. Fixed-blades can be double- or single-edged.</p><h3>Folder</h3><p>Also referred to as a pocket knife, a folder is a compact knife that features one or more blades that fold up into the handle in lieu of using a bulky sheath. Meant to fit easily inside your pocket, these knives are legal to carry in most places, and are convenient to carry and use daily. They are frequently smaller than fixed blades, with blades typically between three and four inches long, although there are many exceptions that are both longer and shorter than this. Folding karambits are also limited to being single-edged, due to the spine of the blade always being exposed. However, they're quite handy â€” they can do everything from peeling an apple to cutting rope or canvas to opening packages. Though these folding knives are typically smaller and not as strong as their fixed blade siblings, they're highly versatile.</p><h3>Trainer</h3><p>These are commonly used for practice and training as a notably safer substitute for ""live blades,"" i.e., knives that are sharp. Typically, trainers are made of rubber or plastic, though unsharpened, blunted metal training blades do exist.</p>"
6 person tents,"<h2>Types of 6-person tents</h2><h3>Dome-shaped tents</h3><p>One of the most widely available tent styles, dome-shaped tents are freestanding and take on an arch-like structure. While they may have a peak height of over six feet, they do cave in on all sides, making them feel a bit less spacious than tents with more vertical walls. This does mean, however, that they hold up better in the wind, as the slanted tent sides do a better job with deflection.</p><p>These tents are typically fairly simple to set up and can feature ample storage space, including vestibules. This includes our budget pick, the Coleman Sundome 6 and the REI Co-op Base Camp 6.</p><h3>Cabin tents</h3><p>Cabin tents are known for their nearly vertical walls and often offer more room for you and your gear than traditional dome-shaped tents. Some of these options take on an almost rectangular shape, and some still slant out on the sides, while still maintaining their upright shape. These tents also often feature vestibules for gear storage, or they have options to extend the rainfly as an awning using trekking poles.</p><p>The downside of these tents is they often don't stand up well against strong winds, since their sides are so vertical. This category includes tents such as the CORE 6 Person Instant Cabin Tent and the NEMO Wagontop 6. The REI Co-op Kingdom 6 tent is also similar, with a tunnel-like structure.</p><h3>Instant tents</h3><p>Pretty self-explanatory, these tents are known for their ability to be set up almost instantly. Oftentimes, the poles will be pre-attached to the tent fabric, removing at least one step of the process. These tents are also very easy to take down and are a great option for newer campers looking to not waste time dealing with a tent.</p><p>This category also includes the CORE 6 Person Instant Cabin Tent, our pick for the best instant tent.</p>"
backpacking sleeping pads,"<h2>Types of backpacking sleeping pads</h2><p>More often than not, sleeping pads are designed for specific purposes like weather conditions and environments. For instance, one pad might be great to use in the summer, but terrible in winter. They also have advantages and disadvantages for sleeping positions.</p><h3>Closed-cell foam</h3><p>Closed-cell foam is a dense sheet of foam where each bubble is separated by thin-pliable walls. An easier way to visualize it is to say it's like the ISO-mat you're issued in boot camp (or a yoga mat).</p><p>Closed-cell foam sleeping pads are lightweight, durable, and offer consistent insulation in all weather conditions, but they're also not as comfortable or supportive as other options. Nonetheless, many outdoorsmen use them in addition to a primary sleeping pad.</p><h3>Open-cell foam</h3><p>Open-cell foam is when more than half of the cells are open, which makes it softer and more breathable than closed-cell foam. It feels almost like packing insulation. As a sleeping pad, they're also referred to as self-inflating sleeping pads.</p><p>Where the name ""self-inflating"" comes from is when you roll them up, it pushes the air out, so when you unroll them and open a valve, they expand on their own. But to maximize comfort and capabilities, you still need to blow in a few breaths. While they're bulkier than other options, they are very comfortable, warm, and durable. They're a solid utilitarian choice.</p><h3>Air pad</h3><p>An air pad is like an air mattress in that it's inflatable and the primary insulation is air, but they're usually tailored for individual use and specific temperature conditions. You can find air pad designs for warm, cool, cold, and extremely cold conditions.</p><p>Air pads are widely considered to be the most comfortable and the most packable of the three pads, but they're also the most fragile. They can be punctured and hold water, which will eventually result in bacteria or mold growth.</p>"
plasma lighters,"<h2>Types of plasma lighters</h2><p>Aside from shape and size, plasma lighters are essentially all very similar. They all use a battery to generate intense, controlled heat. Some are built to withstand the elements and others are better suited to a candlelight dinner, but the components are largely the same. The main difference that affects performance is the number of arcs used to generate enough heat to spark a flame.</p><h3>Single-arc plasma lighters</h3><p>At a minimum, a plasma lighter must have two points separated by a small enough gap that an electrical charge can cross the gap, but far enough apart that whatever you're trying to light can fit between them. These two points create a single band of heat, called an arc. Arcs appear as purple light and are very hot.</p><p>This method generates quite a bit of heat, but applications can be limited. Candle wicks and small pieces of tinder are no problem, but the kind of damp material you might encounter at a campsite might present too much of a challenge for a single arc. Size can also be an issue. Lighting a cigarette with a single arc is easy enough, but cigars and pipes might require something larger.</p><h3>Dual-arc plasma lighters</h3><p>For a little bit more money, you can get a plasma lighter with two arcs instead of one. This configuration creates an X-shaped arc pattern that results in more heat than a single-arc plasma lighter would produce. Some combined arcs also produce enough to insert into the bowl of a pipe, which can be difficult with most single-arc plasma lighters.</p><p>This is what we recommend for most outdoor activities. Having two arcs instead of one gives you more power to work with and adds a layer of redundancy that's valuable when you're far removed from civilization. All our picks for camping and survival settings use two arcs.</p>"
treadmills under 1000,"<h2>Types of treadmills under $1,000</h2><h3>Motorized</h3><p>The most common treadmills these days use some type of motor to propel the belt. Typical treadmill motors range from two to four horsepower, but they can be more or less than this depending on the model. In general, you want a treadmill with at least a 2.5-horsepower motor if you're planning to use it for jogging, and at least three horsepower for running. Motorized treadmills tend to be larger than their manual counterparts, for obvious reasons, and therefore will take up more space in your home gym.</p><h3>Manual</h3><p>Manual treadmills are exactly what they sound like; treadmills that make you do most of the work. How unfair, right? It's not like you're trying to break a sweat or something. Most manual treadmills under $1,000 use dual flywheels to provide efficient movement of the belt, once the user gets it started. There are other types of manual treadmills out there (see example), but these machines can run a pretty high price tag, so we won't speak of them here. Manual treadmills are great, in that they do not require any electricity to run, and there are a lot fewer technical parts that the owner needs to worry about maintaining.</p><h3>Foldable</h3><p>Both motorized and manual treadmills can fall into the category of ""foldable,"" which are just treadmills that can be folded up or down to be stored more easily or moved out of the way. The majority of foldable treadmills hinge upward near the motor/flywheels at the front of the machine. The machine then stands upright, using much less space than it would have in its normal configuration. Foldable treadmills are excellent for home gyms with limited space or difficult-to-reach areas like up a flight of stairs or around doorways.</p>"
cabin tents,"<h2>Types of cabin tents</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>This is like your dome tent's dad, in that it's made in a similar fashion, just with longer, stronger rods and (usually) heavier fabrics. Compared to normal camping tents, cabin tents are much more upright and provide more space. While all the cabin tents on our list are roomy and well-built, their sizes and features are what make them unique. You can find normal tents for a single person, but the smallest cabin tents are meant for groups of four. You can always take advantage of that size to give one or two people more room, but don't expect your cabin tent to be quite as portable or compact as a traditional alternative. Cabin tents also differ from one another in their intended length of stay. Most are designed for short-term use. Others are much more robust and can be used year-round; just remember that setting them up is quite a task.</p><h3>Hammock</h3><p>This is arguably not a cabin tent, but can be as roomy so we're including it here. These tents use an old fashioned method of hanging from a line suspended between either poles or trees, with the walls pulled away, creating a long peak down the middle. These are light, and can be more easily used in more remote areas, but aren't as secure as a traditional cabin tent.</p><h3>Yurt</h3><p>This style is picking up some popularity of late. Yurt tents are modelled after the portable, circular yurt dwellings of ancient Mongolia. They're spacious, and easily set up and broken down. Typically a central pole lifts the center high, and the circular wall drapes down all around. These typically also use treated cotton type cloth (vs the synthetic fabrics most other kinds of cabin tents use).</p>"
camping hammocks,"<h2>Types of camping hammocks</h2><h3>Lounging hammocks</h3><p>These are your basic parachute hammocks â€” typically the most affordable options on the market. This includes options like the famed ENO SingleNest and DoubleNest hammocks, as well as budget options like the Wise Owl Outfitters DoubleOwl hammock.</p><p>These options are great for setting up in your backyard or the local park, and they're light enough to throw in your pack for backpacking. Although they often don't come with many features, you can purchase an additional bug net, rain tarp, and under- and over-quilts to use these hammocks all four seasons.</p><h3>Ultralight hammocks</h3><p>These hammocks are the best options for avid backpackers looking to cut out that heavy tent with an ultralight option. Hammocks like the Kammok Roo Single Ultralight Hammock weigh less than an apple and cut out heavy items like carbineers. These may not be the warmest options, so if you are going out in cold weather, make sure to invest in quilts or rain tarps to shield yourself from wind and weather. These hammocks are generally cheap compared to options with more features.</p><h3>Tent hammocks</h3><p>If you are camping in hammocks for all four seasons, tent-like hammocks will be your best bet, providing shelter from the elements. Options like the Hennessy Hammock Expedition Asym Zip and the Kammok Mantis All-In-One Hammock Tent come with built-in rain tarps and bug nets, as well as suspension systems.</p><p>Other options like the Lawson Blue Ridge Camping Hammock leave behind the banana-like hammock shape altogether and suspend a flat frame, which doubles as a tent bivy that can be staked to the ground. These options are typically more expensive and not great for lounging and sitting up, so make sure you definitely require these additional features.</p>"
lpvo scopes,"<h2>Types of LPVOs</h2><h3>First focal plane</h3><p>First or front focal plane scopes place the reticle in front of the scope's erector. This creates the effect of the reticle growing and shrinking as magnification increases or decreases. Nothing actually grows or shrinks, and the magnification just makes it appear to occur.</p><p>Modern LPVO reticles often feature markings for bullet drop and windage and tools like rangefinders. These markings are measurements typically in MOA or MILs. The benefit to an FFP scope is that these measurements remain the same regardless of the magnification range, allowing them to remain accurate at any magnification.</p><p>With LPVOs in particular, the illuminated portions and reticles shrink at lower settings. This gives the illuminated portion a red dot-like small size, and since the main reticle shrinks, it's not obstructing your vision for close-quarter shooting.</p><h3>Second focal plane</h3><p>Second focal plane scopes place the reticle behind the scope's erector. This has the effect of the reticle remaining the same size throughout the magnification range. Since the magnification changes but the reticle does not, the measurements in MOA or MIL are often only accurate at one magnification level. This is often, but not always, the highest level of magnification.</p><p>In the world of LPVOs, this can limit your capabilities with high-powered magnified optics. If it's a 1-8X or 1-10X, you want an FFP reticle, and depending on the reticle design for a 1-6X, you might want FFP as well. If you use a 1-4X or even 1.5-5X, then an SFP will likely be perfectly capable.</p><p>LPVOs with lower power and simple reticles can benefit from benign SFP optics. For example, the Trijicon Accupoint's triangle reticle benefits from remaining the same size as magnification increases due to its large size.</p>"
folding knives,"<h2>Types of folding knives</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Back in the day, pocket knives were used for everything from doctoring calves in the field to slicing up an apple at lunch. They had to be sharp, durable, and slim enough to fit in the front pocket of the owner's jeans. Classic design cues like bone handles and polished blades make these popular heirloom items. You can still get excellent examples from brands like Case, but they probably aren't what you're looking for in a military knife. Blades tend to be on the small side and require two hands to open.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Today's folding knives offer a huge selection of tactical options. If you need weather-resistant materials, smooth operation, and a no-nonsense blade, this is where you need to be shopping. Tactical folding knives are sharp enough to make quick work of everything from 550 cord to MRE wrappers, strong enough to hack through thick underbrush, and sturdy enough to take a beating no matter where Uncle Sam sends you. Look for blades in the five-inch range with or without serration. Most offer some form of corrosion protection, whether in the materials themselves or with some kind of coating.</p><h3>Spring-assisted</h3><p>In addition to run-of-the-mill tactical features, many of the knives designed for military use incorporate a mechanism designed to make one-handed opening easier. Some spring-assisted knives can be opened with the touch of a button rather than the typical wrist-flick you're probably used to. No, these are not switchblades. It's never a bad idea to research knife regulations in your area, but odds are you won't run into problems with this kind of blade.</p>"
camping gear,"<h2>Types of camping gear</h2><p>When considering camping gear, it's important to first understand what type of camping you will be doing. For car camping, where you just pull into a campground and set up, you can get away with cheaper, heavier gear. If you're going to be traveling by foot into the backcountry and carrying everything you need on your back, you'll want to find the lightest gear that can meet your needs â€” and this typically comes at greater cost due to the advanced lightweight materials and research and development costs.</p><h3>Tent</h3><p>If you are spending the night outside, most people want to be sheltered from the wind and rain, and this means setting up a tent. Car camping tents are generally larger, heavier, and bulkier and fit more people. Backpacking tents generally fit one to two people and weigh less than eight pounds.</p><h3>Sleeping bags</h3><p>A good sleeping bag is key to staying warm and comfortable during a night outside. Sleeping bags typically come in two designs: rectangular (for car camping) and mummy bags (for backpacking). The former are roomier and heavier and the latter maximize warmth per ounce in design by minimizing material.</p><h3>Sleeping pads</h3><p>If you're going to sleep on the ground, a good sleeping pad will keep you warmer and more comfortable. Sleeping bags work by trapping warm air in loft insulation, and when you lay on them, they lose almost all insulating ability below your body. This is why it's important to have a good sleeping pad to provide insulation and warmth. Sleeping pads come in two main types: closed-cell foam and air.</p>"
camping stoves,"<h2>Types of camping stoves</h2><p>Camping stoves come in two basic categories: ones you are willing to carry on your back for long distances and those you aren't â€” backpacking stoves and car camping/basecamp stoves.</p><h3>Backpacking</h3><p>Backpacking stoves are typically lightweight single-burner units that may or may not have the ability to simmer. They are almost exclusively fueled by isobutane/propane canisters or pressurized liquid fuel like white gas. The former is more convenient to use and more efficient, and the latter performs better at altitude and in cold temperatures. These stoves are typically designed to boil water fast for rehydrating dehydrated food or cooking simple foods like pasta or couscous. Most are not suitable for large, heavy pots or large groups.</p><h3>Car camping stoves</h3><p>Car camping stoves resemble home kitchen stoves and are much larger, heavier, and more powerful than backpacking stoves. They are portable stove tops and come in one- or two-burner configurations with pop-up windscreens to make them more efficient. Car camping stoves are much more versatile and perform better in terms of temperature control when cooking. They're also great for cooking for large groups.</p><h3>Biofuel stoves</h3><p>Biofuel stoves are generally stainless steel containers that serve as small fire pits and gain thermal efficiency through rocket stove design. The upside is that they don't use fossil fuels. The downside is that you have to find or bring along the fuel, light a fire, do your thing, wait for it to cool down, and then pack it up if you are moving again. Also, some wilderness areas prohibit fires from time to time.</p>"
gun oils,"<h2>Types of gun oils</h2><p>There is more than one way to classify gun oils depending on use, delivery, and materials used. In the spirit of simplicity, I chose to classify the oil by its intended usage.</p><h3>Solvents</h3><p>If you're unfamiliar with solvents or have never heard of a solvent before, think cleaner. These are chemicals that dissolve other substances, specifically for cleaning purposes. When you fire a round, the carbon emitted from the burning of the gunpowder will accumulate in almost every nook and cranny of your gun. The buildup can be tough to remove, so using a solvent or soaking the parts in one will help dissolve the carbon buildup and make cleaning easier.</p><h3>Lubricants</h3><p>Nobody likes friction â€” it burns and is uncomfortable. Guns don't like it either, as bare metal to metal action has the potential to cause critical failures. We're talking broken pieces, worn down parts, or worse. To ensure the action works properly and smoothly, all you have to do is apply lubricating oil. These do not clean and are solely meant to prevent unwanted friction and heating of parts.</p><h3>Protectants</h3><p>Whether you're storing your gun for months at a time or shooting regularly, it's important to have oil that protects the metal from rusting or damage. These oils are designed to enter the pores of the metal or wood and fill them up. Some oils harden a little, a process called resinification. Filling the pores is what protects the material from oxidation or other chemicals, like skin oil, that break it down over time.</p>"
wallets,"<h2>Types of wallets</h2><h3>Slim wallet</h3><p>If you've ever dealt with a bulky wallet that won't slide into your pocket, you're familiar with the value of a slim wallet. The minimalist design is meant to help you keep the essentials (and only the essentials) on your person. That means it has fewer card holding pockets and a small opening for cash. Most don't incorporate closures, using the pressure of the design to hold your items firmly in place. The compact structure is geared towards those looking to cut through the noise and only carry the things actually necessary to function.</p><h3>RFID wallet</h3><p>A modern type of wallet, the need for protection against data theft is relatively new. Designed to block radio frequencies from accessing the cards inside the wallet, these are built to resist RFID skimming. It all comes down to the material used in construction. Leather offers a baseline level of protection, though more advanced materials like carbon-fibre and aluminum go one step further. This type of wallet is designed for those who always carry their credit and debit cards and want to prioritize personal security.</p><h3>Bifold wallet</h3><p>Often called a billfold wallet, this type touts a more traditional design. Popularized when paper money became prevalent, the bifold wallet originally had few card compartments (originally used for business cards). Modern designs keep the original structure that opens at the center, though add in extra openings for cards. The textile structure ranges in material from leather to nylon, though many prefer leather for its natural level of RFID protection.</p>"
camelbak,"<h2>Types of CamelBak products</h2><h3>Sport-specific</h3><p>The CamelBak brand got its start when EMT Michael Eidson jerry-rigged an IV bag, hose, and crew sock to keep himself hydrated during a grueling summer Texas bike race. To this day, CamelBak makes biking-specific hydration packs, but it has expanded its line to provide other sport-specific packs. The company now specializes in solutions for biking, hiking, and snow sports. While bikers and runners may need a minimalist CamelBak to achieve top times, skiers and snowboarders will opt for a pack with proper insulation for both the reservoir and hose. Find your niche, pick a pack, and get moving.</p><h3>General purpose</h3><p>Some people need a hydration pack that can handle more than just one sport at a time. There's a solution for you too. In addition to its sport-specific offerings, CamelBak has created a handful of general purpose and multi-sport options designed to keep you hydrated, geared up, and on the go.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Yeah, yeah, everyone's got something tacticool these days, but CamelBak's tactical hydration systems may just be worthy of the ""tactical"" name. While the Army may not endorse CamelBak systems, their stamp of ""OK"" does show that the big brass may have finally figured out what we already knew. While anyone can slap MOLLE onto a bag and call it a day, CamelBak makes sure that their bags provide the features and quality America's grunts have come to expect from quality field gear. So, next time the lieutenant gets lost, you'll be ready for it.</p>"
fleece jackets,"<h2>Types of fleece jackets</h2><p>Synthetic fleece jackets have been around since the early 1980s when Aaron Feuerstein invented Polartec, a polyester yarn woven into a thick fabric. His aim was to improve upon the insulating power of wool fibers by creating a material that was lightweight and warm even when damp. Patagonia was the first major retailer to use Polartec in its classic Synchilla jacket, and there have been more than 40 years of innovation since. Fleece jackets are generally categorized by weight: lightweight (100 g/m2), midweight (200 g/m2), and heavyweight (300 g/m2).</p><h3>Lightweight</h3><p>Lightweight fleece jackets are typically made from 100 weight Polartec and are sometimes referred to as R1 jackets. They are the most breathable and packable and offer moderate warmth. The 100 series jackets are typically designed for high output efforts like trail running, cross country skiing, and mountain biking.</p><h3>Midweight</h3><p>Midweight fleece jackets are typically made from 200 weight Polartec and are also called mid-layers. They can be worn as a jacket during cool temperatures or as an insulating layer over a base layer and under a windproof shell during colder temps. They are the most versatile of the bunch.</p><h3>Heavyweight</h3><p>Heavyweight fleece jackets are typically made from 300 (or greater) weight Polartec and are the warmest but also the least breathable. You don't see as many 300 or 400 weight jackets on the market anymore, as most people opt for lightweight down jackets or soft shells in lieu of these bulky and baggy outer layers.</p>"
office chair,"<h2>Types of office chairs</h2><h3>Ergonomic</h3><p>One of the most popular types of chairs is those with an ergonomic structure. These models are designed to help you avoid musculoskeletal issues related to staying seated for extended periods. By promoting posture through lumbar support, cushioning, and armrests, these chairs limit fatigue and facilitate improved circulation. Though a bit higher on the pricing spectrum, these chairs are a good way to go if you spend long hours at the office.</p><h3>Executive</h3><p>If you are looking for a chair with a professional look, this type has a lot to offer. You can easily spot them through the high back, prominent neck support, and regal appearance. These chairs feature ample cushioning and have a substantial amount of lumbar and arm support. While they have some ergonomic features, fewer parts of these chairs are adjustable. As a result, this type is good for business meetings and working in shorter spurts.</p><h3>Mesh</h3><p>If your office is in a poorly ventilated area, mesh office chairs have a lot of advantages. Per the namesake, the back of the chair is made out of mesh. Breathing well in all cases, most are structured to offer back support and promote circulation. There is a wide variety of these chairs available, though most have wheeled bases and a top that swivels. Though the mesh back limits lumbar support adjustability, you can usually change the height of the chair's base and the armrests.</p>"
emergency blanket,"<h2>Types of emergency blankets</h2><h3>Mylar blanket</h3><p>This is easily the most common type of emergency blanket, originally called a space blanket. It is made out of mylar, an aluminum-based material that is lightweight yet not bulky. The blanket is designed to fold down compactly, fit well into any space, and be thoroughly waterproof. The key behind the material is to prevent natural heat loss by reflecting the energy back inwards and trapping it.</p><p>First crafted by NASA, these blankets have become one of the standards for first-aid kits. They feature a plastic coating that keeps the blanket dry and comes in a wide range of sizes (though the bigger they are, the easier they tear). A quality option will be able to reflect back anywhere from 90 to 97 percent of heat, making this type a very energy-efficient option.</p><h3>Sleeping bag</h3><p>Taking mylar technology to the next level, some modern emergency blankets use the metallic features of the blanket in conjunction with insulation. Keep in mind that, because of the extra material, these blankets are bulkier and moderately heavier than their mylar counterparts. In most cases, the blanket is made out of ripstop nylon.</p><p>These blankets are specifically designed for camping or hiking, meant to lend an extra level of security against the elements. In most cases, this type of emergency bag is reusable and generally more comfortable than thinner blankets. Typically, these blankets will come as a standalone.</p>"
ankle holsters,"<h2>Types of ankle holsters</h2><h3>Strap-on</h3><p>Ankle holsters must be secure and easy to use, and for most people, putting their holster on in the morning must fall into the category of ""easy to use."" Many (if not most) ankle holsters rely on a single strap or a series of straps to secure them in place, making them much easier to don and doff without removing your shoes than other ankle holsters. Most often, these holsters employ hook-and-loop straps to further improve the user's experience.</p><p>In addition to their ease of use, strap-on holsters usually provide a better fit than most other ankle holsters. The holster straps allow users to provide the perfect level of tension, allowing him or her to find an ideal balance between concealability and comfort.</p><h3>Slip-on</h3><p>Slip-on ankle holsters are easier and more economical to manufacture, making them a favorite choice for buyers looking to stick to a budget. These holsters usually consist of a neoprene band to which the actual holster is attached, providing a good combination of flexibility and compression. However, without a calf strap to secure the holster, most slip-on holsters will only work for short-term excursions.</p><p>Since most slip-on ankle holsters are made of neoprene, comfort can be an issue, especially when wearing the holster for an extended period of time. As such, the best slip-on holsters combat this issue with moisture-wicking liners or breathable neoprene bands.</p>"
mag pouches for plate carriers,"<h2>Types of mag pouches for plate carriers</h2><p>When we're looking at mag pouches specifically for attaching to a plate carrier, there isn't a lot of variety.</p><h3>Basic</h3><p>Basic mag pouches are one, two, or three magazines in a single row that rides close to the plate carrier. These are the basic design of mag pouches and prevent unwanted bulk. Many of these feature MOLLE webbing on the front for you to customize the kit with. Where basic mag pouches excel is that they keep mags close to your body and help spread out the load.</p><h3>Stackers</h3><p>These are bulkier than basic mag pouches because they feature a second row of mag pouches in the front. Two-by-one, two-by-two, or two-by-three, these increase the number of magazines you can carry in a consolidated form. The mags can be staggered at different heights, or ride at the same height with different levels of fabric on the pouches. These are ideal for anyone needing to carry a large number of magazines.</p><h3>Kangaroo</h3><p>Named after the marsupial that carries its young in a stomach pouch, kangaroo mag pouches have additional pouches integral to the front. These are commonly pistol mag pouches so that warfighters with secondaries don't have to find more accessories. However, the kangaroo feature could also be an admin, radio, or grenade pouch. These are versatile-styled pouches for anyone with wide mission scopes.</p>"
punching bags,"<h2>Types of punching bags</h2><p>While there are different styles of punching bags, which vary by how you're supposed to strike them, the types of punching bags we're covering here involve how you set them up.</p><h3>Hanging</h3><p>A hanging bag is most likely what you picture when you think about a punching bag. It hangs from an anchor from above and dangles using chains or straps. Most hanging bags will swing during your workout and force you to move accordingly. The really heavy ones â€” usually designed for power punching â€” need more force to move, so they won't swing as much.</p><p>Additionally, if you have a bag lighter than 70 pounds and you don't want it to swing, or you have something like a double-end bag, you should anchor it to the floor as well as the ceiling.</p><h3>Standing</h3><p>A standing punching bag eliminates the need for an anchor point or hanging stand. They are stationary bags that are built onto a base that stabilizes them. That base is filled with sand or water to ensure not even One-Punch Man can knock it down.</p><p>Standing bags can be a great alternative to hanging bags when your space is limited or you might live somewhere you are not allowed or cannot safely anchor a punching bag. A standing bag can be tucked into a corner and only pulled out when needed.</p>"
