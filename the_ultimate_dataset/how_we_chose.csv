glock 19 holsters,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>While there are thousands of holsters available, we set out to find the best Glock 19 holster.

We also tried to keep our picks at a manageable price point most land somewhere between $65 and $135 - and offer different types of carry.</p><p>For this review guide, I tested a total of 10 holsters by wearing them as I would normally. I judged each Glock 19 holster on comfort and concealability. Given that the biggest issue for any concealed carrier is getting your gun to disappear behind your clothes, I wore the holsters with a variety of outfits. The most difficult test was concealing the handgun while wearing leggings and a T-shirt. Most of the holsters on this list did OK with that test, but there were a few that exceeded my expectations.</p>"

The weight and packed size is important because if an emergency blanket is too big, you won't carry it.

All of these blankets passed in terms of my willingness to use them again for continued training.</p>"
plasma lighters,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Our reviews are backed by scientists, engineers, journalists, and researchers who work tirelessly to test and rate the products and services you use every day.</p><p>We used all these lighters exactly the same way. We used them to light votive-style candles, both fresh and previously burned.(Only some of the lighters we evaluated were able to light votive-style candles that had burned down somewhat, because of the increased distance between the lighter and the wick.) We also used them to light our home gas range and learned that wand- or stick-style lighters were best for this job because your hand is not close to the gas when it ignites.</p><p>Outside, we also lit a backpacking canister stove that runs on pressurized propane, and my wife and we each evaluated the lighters on some home fireworks, like sparklers, as well as using them to ignite newspaper stuffed inside a chimney starter we use to fire up our charcoal grill. For all these evaluations (save the kitchen stove and the votives), we were dealing with very windy weather but relatively low humidity. As noted in the introduction, we also held each lighter directly in front of a high-powered fan.</p>"

This allowed us to get hands-on time, see how these watches fit on a variety of people, and evaluate factors that you can't get from simple measurements, like how it feels in the hand, or how gritty the winding of the movement feels.</p>"
ghillie suits,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Investigating the various ghillie suits on the market is an intriguing process. There are numerous options available to the consumer. Durability and construction, breathability, packability, color palette, and application were all important considerations for us. As an alternative, we reviewed hunting-specific products. The majority of this research was conducted through field testing and prior experience.</p><p>There are numerous forums and articles about ghillies on the internet.

hunting backpacks,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Because hunting backpacks cover a wide range of hunt types, we limited our search to packs designed specifically for multi-day, backcountry big-game pursuits. Having said that, we made sure to cover packs for less strenuous outings, such as a tree stand whitetail hunt.</p><p>In addition to looking for bags that were quiet and weather-resistant, we looked for packs that could withstand heavy loads year after year without breaking down. This meant a pack made of tough materials, with strong stitching and a long-lasting weight-bearing frame.

biometric gun safes,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>My fellow firearms enthusiasts and I did our best to provide informative and honest reviews wherever we could. Obtaining a dozen safes would be a time-consuming and costly endeavor, which is why this guide is heavily research-driven.

digital watches,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We'd love to hand-test all of these digital watches, but time and logistical constraints prevent us from doing so. Fortunately, we've personally used the majority of these brands in demanding environments and can attest to their quality.

headlamps for hunting,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Everyone is entitled to a high-quality product from a reputable manufacturer. We started by looking for companies with a proven track record of producing reliable gear, and then we filtered out products that couldn't be used in bad weather. Although not every hunting headlamp must be completely waterproof, some level of weather protection is required. Finally, we prioritized headlights with multiple power output settings so you can have the right amount of light for any job. This wasn't a deal-breaker, but it was something to think about.</p>"
rifle cases,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>It is critical to keep the purpose of the rifle case in mind when selecting a rifle case. Whether it's a quick trip to the range or a three-day trek into the woods in search of the perfect hunting spot, you'll need a case that's up to the task.

We also talked to other gun owners and enthusiasts. We did everything we could to investigate the quality and means of the products as thoroughly as possible, using all available channels..</p>"
generators for camping,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>To begin our market research, we considered why people need generators for camping. A pocket-sized power bank would suffice if all we needed to power was a phone and Bluetooth headphones. Campers looking for a generator are likely to require enough power to power larger devices such as a laptop, lighting, and possibly an electric grill, so that's where my search began.</p><p>We investigated how various types of generators operate to understand the benefits and drawbacks of fuel-burning and solar-powered generators.</p><p>Solar generators were prioritized because they are more environmentally friendly, easier to operate, and do not constantly consume increasingly expensive fuel. We also concentrated on manufacturers whose products I know are consistent of high quality. As a result, we've compiled a short but carefully curated list of some of the best camping generators available right now.</p>"

We relied on these sources because members typically provide more accurate feedback.</p><p>We chose tactical knives based on their overall quality and performance. We sought blades that were long-lasting, versatile, and simple to maintain. We took into account the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's quality control reputation. We specifically looked for corrosion-resistant blades, either because they were stainless steel or because they had a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Leather sheaths and wooden handles were avoided due to their proclivity to retain moisture.</p>"
ultralight sleeping bags,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>The first step in researching the best ultralight sleeping bags was to tap into the pool of knowledge on my team. Each sleeping bag was evaluated based on its material, brand reputation, pricing, and categorical efficiency.

Even outside of our own experience, we've spent a long time personally purchasing a diverse variety of jackets from a wide range of brands, and we've learned a few little tricks to predict how a product will perform in the long run.</p>"
camping mugs,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Cost, weight, liquid capacity, insulation type, and material used were all factors considered when comparing camping mugs. Any camping mug models that were similar but mildly inferior to others were eliminated from the evaluation pool. For example, there is a very well-known and highly regarded brand, but there are hundreds of knockoffs that offer nothing more than a discounted price and fewer features. After narrowing down the finalists, we used our firsthand experience with the camping mugs, as well as manufacturer-provided data, to determine the best selection in each category.</p>"
machetes,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We relied on advice shared in online forums, particularly a few social media groups for machete enthusiasts. We relied on these sources because members typically provide better feedback than product review sections on most knife websites.</p><p>Because of their overall quality and performance, the machetes we chose came highly recommended. We looked for blades that were long-lasting, versatile, and simple to maintain. We looked at the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's quality control record. We specifically sought out blades that were corrosion-resistant, either because they were stainless steel or because they had a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Wooden handles were avoided because they splintered and retained moisture. Finally, we eliminated any machetes with partial tangs or thin rat-tail tangs because they are weaker than full tangs.</p>"
backpacking backpacks,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Whenever possible, we used a combination of extensive product and consumer insights, skillful evaluations, personal experience, and hands-on testing. We looked for true backpacking packs that could carry 25 pounds or more of gear for multi-day trips in the wilderness, having some hiking and backpacking expertise in the field ourselves.</p><p>To ensure we didn't miss out on current trends, we combed through backpacker forums to get a sense of what's trendy and what isn't among those who use these backpacking backpacks frequently. We then used this information to start narrowing down potential candidates for our list.</p>"
gun safes under 500,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>When searching for a high-quality gun safe, we strive to find one that has a lot of features but isn't too expensive. We also regard the safe's purpose. While they all do the same thing in general, restricting access to firearms is not the same as securing them.</p><p>We limited our search to safes, figuring that anything would suffice. It should be adequate for wherever you live. I also took into account feedback from product reviews, as well as personal experience we've gained over the years.</p><p>While not all of the safes are designed to be pulled out of the ground and dragged away by thieves with a truck, they will all provide temporary protection from unauthorized access. We ranked the safes based on their price, features, ease of use, wall thickness, and locking mechanisms.</p>"
go bags,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We started by revisiting the whole idea behind go bags. We chose a range of bags that satisfies a range of needs, including getting home from work, indefinite wilderness survival, and everything in between.

Whether you want something that can tag along during a deployment, get you to the campsite every weekend, or ride shotgun in your car every day.</p>"
4 season tents,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>To refine our suggestions for the best four-season tents, we looked at some well-known camping brands. From there, we focused on materials that have been proven to withstand rain, wind, and snow while remaining breathable enough not to turn into a sauna in hot weather.</p><p>We took notes on the tent poles' materials to compare strength versus weight. Then we dug deeper into the tent's dimensions, the number of people who could sleep in each tent, the overall weight, and how easy or difficult it was to set up. We also considered whether each tent had a vestibule for unloaded gear and whether it came with its footprint or had to be purchased separately. We compiled common compliments and complaints from both customer and expert reviews. We test items ourselves whenever possible to gain first-hand knowledge of how a product performs in the field.</p>"

water purification tablets,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We narrowed the field of our search down to the various brands and types of purification tablets that we tested. Because some of the brands use the same chemicals and concentrations to make their tablets, we ended up testing a large number of them to see how they differed in terms of quality, taste, packaging, and so on. We ignored in-place purifiers, membrane purifiers, UV purifiers, and liquid/powder water purifiers in favor of tablet water purifiers. There are examples of each of these that work well, but tablet purifiers are ideal for portable kits.</p>"

life jackets,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We are lifelong aquatics enthusiasts, and we relied heavily on previous experience when selecting life jackets. We've personally used a wide range of PFDs from numerous brands, as well as more specialized devices such as float coats and dry suits, in virtually every type of sea state and while performing complex tasks such as law enforcement or search and rescue. This is why we emphasize proper fit throughout our review; it truly makes a difference. Because adjustability is the name of the game, a wide range of adjustments was one of the top features we sought.</p><p>Another important factor is brand reputation, so we only chose brands that we believe will last a long time and consistently provide the safety that they are rated for. Other professional recommendations and customer reviews were also taken into account, and we only included highly rated products from reputable companies.</p>"

As a result, we took special care to limit our search for the best dry bags to brands and products we know and trust. Outside of manufacturers, we looked for dry bags in a variety of sizes, because there will be times when you want to stuff all of your gear into a dry bag, and times when you only need to protect a few valuables or spare pairs of socks. Unique features such as see-through material or removable shoulder straps were also given special consideration.</p>"

camping blankets,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>How did we decide which camping blankets were the best? We've used various types and styles of blankets made of various materials. We did a deep dive into the manufacturer's website as well as independent third-party reviews when we couldn't get hands-on with a reviewed blanket to determine build country/quality/materials, warranty, and so on. Only the most consistent and well-reviewed blankets were considered.</p>"
gun safes under 1000,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We take gun safety very seriously, especially when it comes to storage and security. We scoured the internet for the best-rated free-standing gun safes that aren't too expensive.</p><p>We started by looking for long gun safes from reputable retailers and online marketplaces. Anything over $1,000 before shipping and installation was not considered.</p><p>Safes in the price range we were looking for were then sorted by review score, from highest to lowest. We focused on several key attributes necessary for proper care and security of your valuable firearms after narrowing our models down to a few dozen: capacity, fireproofing duration, weight, warranty options, and several others. The majority of these safes were good options, but they didn't have anything special to offer.</p>"
hunting gps,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>""Hunting"" cannot be defined in any specific way. Hunting is a sport for some. Others see it as a way of life, a means of survival, or an existential challenge to become more in tune with their food source. There are numerous reasons to go hunting, as well as numerous ways to go about it. Recognizing this, we set out to review a wide range of hunting GPS devices that would be suitable for any of your hunting needs, whether you are a local hunter hunting your own land or a global adventurer looking for bigger challenges and bigger game.</p><p>To ensure that we are providing you with the best recommendations possible, we have spent considerable time researching individual items, their capabilities, and their uses.</p>"
tactical watches,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>When choosing tactical watches for this list, we relied on personal experience with a variety of different brands.</p><p>We also looked at customer reviews to find out what people were saying about these brands and their products. Customer reviews are a great way to see what other people think about a product, but keep in mind that one person's opinion isn't necessarily representative of the entire market.</p><p>Finally, we looked at what others in the hiking industry have to say about the best tactical watches. We read reviews from hiking and climbing bloggers and travel magazines.

tactical flashlights,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>We chose designs that would appeal to a wide range of people when selecting a set of lights for our initial review of rechargeable flashlights. We prioritized more affordable lights with tint and long run times over features that will stand out to someone carrying a duty light or trying to stay safe in a dark alley.</p><p>After reviewing the most recent flashlight recommendations from flashlight nerds, we checked in with tactically minded enthusiasts at gear-oriented hangouts. When we talked with friends who carry a light for security, border patrol, and sheriff duty, we learned that they mostly picked whatever was available at their favorite ranges.</p>"

concealed carry holsters for women,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When it comes to shooting and carrying firearms, I take things pretty seriously. I've been in and around the gun industry and community for about nine years and I'm always searching for the latest and greatest piece of gear that claims to solve all my problems with carrying a concealed firearm. I attend training courses as often as possible to ensure my proficiency doesn't suffer, as shooting is a perishable skill. Throughout my years, I've taken classes by well-known shooting instructors like Dave Maynard and John Correia, and from formal training schools as well.</p><p>Taking everything I can from these classes, I have applied the lessons to my daily life as a licensed concealed carry permit holder over the last three years. During my concealed carry journey, I have tried a vast array of concealed carry holsters that claim to offer the most comfortable and concealable package on the market. The biggest issue with most holsters on the market is not specifically if they will conceal well, but if they will conceal well with women's clothing.</p><p>While there are seemingly endless options for concealable holsters from a multitude of manufacturers, I set out to compile some of the best, specifically for women since we are generally overlooked by holster manufacturers who seem to think everybody who carries is a guy wearing a plaid shirt and loose cargo pants. I narrowed my search based on feedback that I have gotten from other women who carry on a daily basis, online sources, and things that I have learned throughout my time as a concealed carry permit holder.</p><p>I limited my search to holsters constructed from durable material and designed to completely cover the trigger guard. The reason is, we don't want any foreign object poking into the trigger guard and accidentally actuating the trigger. For this reason, nylon holsters and most leather holsters did not make it into my top picks. I tried to keep budget in mind, with most holsters landing in the $85 to $100 range, with a couple of exceptions for those who may need more specialized options.</p>"
backpacking backpacks,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As is typical for our guides, I used a mix of extensive product and user research, expert evaluations, personal experience, and hands-on testing whenever possible. Having some experience hiking and backpacking myself, I looked for true backpacking packs, those that were durable and could carry 25 pounds or more of gear for multi-day trips in the backcountry. (You ultralight backpackers can sit back for a bit, as we're working on that guide next).</p><p>To make sure I wasn't missing out on current trends, I have also combed through backpacker forums for the past several months (e.g., r/backpacking on Reddit, Appalachian Trail hiker and Backpacker groups on Facebook, etc) to get a sense of what's popular (and what's not) with the folks who use these backpacks extensively. I then took this information and started to narrow down contenders for our list.</p><p>I also compared this evolving list to what other experts had created. For this article, I found these ""best of"" articles very helpful: Outdoor Gear Lab, Clever Hiker, Switchback Travel, and Gear Junkie. There's a ton of experience that evaluated these, and I found my selections aligned very well with theirs, as well as what I had gleaned from the previously mentioned backpacker social media groups.</p>"
glock 19 holsters,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When it comes to guns, I'm more than a hobbyist. I've worked in the gun industry for about nine years and, in that time, I've stayed on top of the latest trends and I've attended courses by renowned shooting instructors like Dave Maynard, John Correia, and other training schools as well. Additionally, I've been concealed-carrying a firearm everyday for the past three years. I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of marksmanship, and I've tried and used countless pieces of gear while carrying a concealed weapon. I know what works best for me and I've developed a sense of what works best in general.</p><p>While there are thousands of holsters available, we set out to find the best Glock 19 holster. We narrowed the search by looking at recommendations by other online sources and identifying key features that work best overall. We limited the search to designs constructed from hard plastic - in other words, we've excluded leather, nylon, and hybrid designs. The holsters we picked were obviously formed to fit a Glock 19 handgun, but also designed to completely cover the trigger guard. </p>"
survival food kits,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Whereas all these items can be purchased online either through retail giants or company websites, a few of them were available in person for me to sample.I bought four individual pouches featured in their bulk kits, one entree and one breakfast from each brand, to sample each one's taste, texture, and ease of preparation. Items I couldn't source in a timely manner or haven't personally tried at all were reviewed through our usual research-based methods of digging through expert data and real-life consumer feedback.</p><p>It's in our best interests as journalists and fellow adventurers to provide the most informative yet honest reviews we can on every buyer's guide. Who knows if it could be close friends or even the writers themselves who will have to consult these some day? While it's not always feasible to sample every item in every survival food kit imaginable, that doesn't stop us from delivering the concise takes you need. We combine our real-world experiences with lengthy, tedious research, diving deep into expert and colleague opinions and, arguably the most important bit, consumer feedback. The best food kits will be the most readily available - meaning not currently sold out - easy to prepare, and best-tasting batches around with the trust of real consumers to boot.</p>"
rifle cases,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When selecting a rifle case, it's important to keep in mind the purpose of the case. Whether it's just a day trip to the range or a three-day hike into the woods for that perfect hunting spot, you need a case that's going to suit the job. So, I tried to approach this exercise from a position of meeting the needs of the mission rather than just the weapon.</p><p>To select rifle cases for this guide, I started out by searching Google Shopping and Amazon to find the most common results. Next, I narrowed my search to items I either own or have handled, and I also included items from reputable companies I have worked with before. I read through customer reviews as well, looking for basic issues and ideas I've encountered on my own.</p><p>At this point, I reviewed the features and functionality available to the individual options. I considered things like materials, design principles, and ease of use. I compared items I already own or am familiar with, or, in the cases of items I own, handled personally. I tried to think through how cases would handle in the real world, flaws I've encountered myself, and features I know make a product better.<br/>When possible, I reached out to manufacturers directly, raising any questions or concerns I had developed through my research process, trying to resolve those concerns. I spoke to fellow gun owners and enthusiasts as well, trying to get outside input on features and issues I'd encountered. Insofar as the items I had access to myself, I put them to the test, carrying them to the range, through the woods, and putting them through the ringer as much as possible before developing an opinion. I did everything possible to explore the quality and means of the products as much as possible, through whatever avenues available.</p><p>Furthermore, it's of the utmost importance to our team that our readers know our commitment to open, fair product recommendations and reviews, and that you can trust us to provide you with unbiased, balanced information.</p>"
solar panels for camping,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I selected all of the solar panels in this review based on personal ownership, hands-on inspection, performance reputation, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. I take my time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.

When gear does fail or break, we contact the manufacturer to see if and how it stands by its products. I also take a look at how easy the gear is to maintain or repair in the field - the simpler, the better.</p><p>For final selection, I take all factors into consideration and think: What is the gear I'd most want in my pack?

hunting gps,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>""Hunting"" cannot be nailed down to any certain terms. For some, hunting is a sport. For others, it's a way of life, a means of survival, or an existential challenge, putting one's self closer in tune with their food source. There are many reasons for hunting, and with them, countless ways of putting it into practice. Recognizing this, we've sought to review a wide range of hunting GPS devices that would be suitable to any of your hunting needs, whether you are a local hunter, hunting your own land, or a worldwide adventurer, always seeking bigger challenges and greater game.</p><p>In order to make sure we are giving you the best recommendations possible, we've taken serious time to not only research individual items, their capabilities, and their shortcomings, but also to conduct interviews with fellow hunters and consult expert online sources to learn what people in the field are saying about their devices, how they put them into action, and their suggestions for best practices. Some of the online sources we found beneficial came from the good people at OutdoorLife, The Sporting News, and Eat Elk Meat.</p><p>When we talk about the ""best GPS for hunting,"" we might as well just say ""the best Garmin GPS for hunting"" because Garmin seems to have the market pretty much cornered on quality GPS systems. As you'll see below, most of our selections come from Garmin, which is primarily because it produces such a quality product, but also because there aren't a whole lot of other options that rate anywhere near it.</p><p>Just like you don't want to get lost in the woods on your next hunting trip, we don't want you getting lost in the purchasing process when it comes to your next hunting GPS, which is why we take our duty very seriously to give you the best recommendations possible.

drop leg holsters,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As a veteran of a Coast Guard MSST Team and a lifelong firearms enthusiast, I'm very familiar with duty holsters. Both in my own unit and operating alongside other agencies - from local police departments to the Secret Service and FBI - Safariland was the gold standard for duty holsters (you might even say it was a safari of Safarilands). I used a Safariland 6005 with SLS for my Sig P229R DAK sidearm across countless deployments, boardings, and security zones, so I'm quite familiar with Safariland's offerings on the market and know its reputation for dependability is well-earned.</p><p>I've also used a variety of holster brands over the years and stayed up to date on new developments in the industry. To be among the best drop-leg holsters, a large section of the cheap ""universal"" nylon holsters were eliminated, as they just don't protect the firearm and trigger guard enough in the more exposed position of a drop-leg holster. This is not to say I didn't consider a range of more entry-level options for the folks out there just starting their careers, and I was pleased to see there are good choices in the under-$100 category, too.</p><p>I tried to pick holster and platform combos that seemed most representative of what a manufacturer or holster style can offer, factoring as many additional options into the review as possible. To keep things consistent, I used a bog-standard Glock 19 for each holster, and I also stuck to production holsters that are broadly available. From there, I tested each holster for an extended period of time doing various non-firing activities as well as during a long-range day up in the mountains. I also ran retention drills and shooting exercises drawing from different positions, founded upon my military/LE training and experience. </p>"
camping coffee makers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As always, personal experience, internal and external expert opinion, product research, and user reviews help decide what to include in this guide. I've spent a lot of time camping, backpacking, and hiking in Alaska, the Smokies, along the Appalachian mountains, and areas in between (to say nothing of deployment time in austere environments), and access to coffee is always a prime consideration. So I started pulling this list together by using this experience to scour the internet for coffee makers that could feasibly be used in the great outdoors.</p><p>Since any camping gear necessitates a certain degree of ruggedness and portability, these two characteristics guided our choices considerably. Plus, the product had to be functional in the isolation of a campsite (or deployment site). Weight and size are key considerations for campsite coffee makers, and you'll see that, with one exception, all the gear on this list are very lightweight and compact. Bottom line, the coffee makers that made this list had to be able to produce a good cup of joe, with minimal setup and teardown. Plus, it had to be tough enough to be banged around a bit.</p><p>As I narrowed down the contenders, I compared my list to other gear experts to see how our picks lined up. The outdoor experts at OutdoorGearLab, CleverHiker, and REI all curate great lists, and there are a number of areas where we overlap. I then determined the finalists by carefully reviewing product pages, both from the makers when possible, and on Amazon or other third-party vendor pages as well. Only products with an overwhelming percentage (greater than 70 percent) of positive reviews could make the cut. Click here for more info on our How We Chose our top picks.</p>"
camping pillows,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We selected camping pillows to test by seeing what's offered by retailers like REI and Amazon, as well as reputable brands like Therm-a-Rest and Sea to Summit. We sought items with features like an inflatable chamber, high loft memory foam, down or synthetic padding, a removable/washable cover, a contoured shape so the pillow fits neatly inside a sleeping bag hood and keeps the pillow centered on your neck, and a protective stuff sack or travel case.</p><p>We also took into consideration pack size and weight. Taken as a whole, a camping pillow's combined features will put it primarily in one of two categories: patrollers (backpackers) or FOB dwellers (car campers). If you're a patroller hiking on foot, you'll probably want something packable and lightweight. And, if you're car camping, why settle for an ultralight, ultrasmall camp pillow when you can have cabin comfort?</p><p>For this review, we conducted two different tests with the camping pillows. First, we evaluated ease of use, travel, and storage. And, second, we tested them for comfort. In the first test, we inflated and deflated the pillows (the ones with an air chamber), scrunched and twisted them, stuffed them into their travel sacks, and packed them into a backpack and toughbox to assess travel size and space. And in the second, we evaluated how comfortable they were to sleep on and we judged them based on two separate rounds of sleep: one with a cot and one without a cot. In both tests, we used the pillow with a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag. In total, we evaluated overall size, packability (reduced size), weight, loft, support, comfort, ability to clean, and overall durability.</p>"
backpacking tents,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I'm an experienced long-distance backpacker. I spent 20 years humping overdesigned, heavy, and poorly designed military backpacks and tents, and now am on a quest to seek the lightest, best designed, and most economical backpacking and mountaineering gear on the planet. I have completed more than 700 miles of the Appalachian Trail to date, and have also done some epic climbs in places like the Grand Teton, Rocky Mountain, and Mount Rainier National Parks. I've owned and used more than seven tents in my time - everything from ultralight three-season tents to mountaineering tents that feel like portable bomb shelters.</p><p>To find the best backpacking tents for 2022, I reviewed and used a variety of tents and also solicited the input of friends who spend extensive time in the outdoors and a few mountain guides I know and respect - people who use this gear professionally in some pretty hazardous conditions.</p><p>I specifically looked at the following criteria: weight, design, floor area, quality of materials, weather resistance, ease of use, and packability. I also gave consideration to other factors like unique innovations, advanced materials, and headroom. All told, I'm pretty confident you won't go wrong with any tent on this list - I went after the best, but the trick is finding the right tent for your needs and uses.</p><p>All the backpacking tents in this review were selected based on personal ownership, performance reputation, hands-on inspection, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. I take my time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each tent, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.</p>"
butterfly knives,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Our tedious, in-depth research combined with real experience and knowledge serves to spare you hours in front of a screen. Video demonstrations, expert opinions and, most importantly, customer feedback help us decide on what butterfly knives are appropriate picks for this list. Websites such as Blade HQ and Knife Center are loaded with knives to choose from, accompanied by expert input and an encyclopedia of consumer reviews.</p><p>The best knives were typically multi-talented, purposeful blades that can not only sit pretty but dance, fight, and work with as much balance as possible. They represented strong value in their categories and were backed by armies of consumers who trust in their products. Only the best flippers, precise cutters, and most durable workhorses were considered for each category, with priorities shifting as categories got specific such as being the better EDC or trainers.</p><p>Additionally, it must be noted that there were plenty of acclaimed, top-notch knives that didn't make the cut (sorry) at the time of writing due to a lack of availability. Famous and popular models from companies like Benchmade, Squid Industries, or Bladerunner Systems (BRS) would appear all over different websites but would either be extremely limited, sold out, discontinued, or simply listed as ""unavailable."" We wanted to feature blades you can order the second this article dropped. What good are raving reviews when you can't buy the dang things? Blades with little-to-no consumer feedback or professional testing were also ignored as we heavily emphasize products with trusted, real-world backing.</p>"
gun safes under 1000,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We take gun safety seriously, especially when it comes to storage and security. For this article, we set out to find the best gun safes under $1,000, so all the options you'll find on this list are priced under that price point, but don't skimp on quality.</p><p>Not for lack of trying, but they - probably wisely - denied my request for 10 safes to be shipped to the testing site for an in-depth hands-on review. So instead, we scoured the internet for the best-rated free-standing gun safes designed not to break a budget.</p><p>We began by searching for long gun safes from reputable retailers and online marketplaces - Cabelas, Amazon, Midway USA, and others. Anything over $1,000 (before shipping and installation) was not considered.</p><p>Safes in the budget range we were looking for were then sorted by reviews, highest to lowest. Those with only a handful of reviews, even across multiple websites, were excluded. Once we had our models narrowed down to a few dozen, we focused on several key attributes necessary for proper care and security of your valued firearms: capacity, fireproofing duration, weight, warranty options, and several others.</p><p>The majority of these safes were solid choices, but had nothing to offer that set them apart from their more impressive competitors, so they were discarded from our pool. The ones that made the cut received our in-depth review which you can read for yourself below.</p>"
life jackets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As a former Coast Guard small boat crewman and a lifelong aquatics enthusiast, I relied on a great deal of past experience when making my choices for this list. I've personally used a variety of PFD types from many different brands, including more specialized devices like float coats and dry suits in about every kind of sea state there is and while performing complex tasks like law enforcement or search and rescue. This is why I harp on proper fit so much throughout my review, because it really does make a difference. Adjustability is the name of the game, so a generous range of adjustments is one of the top things I looked for. Brand reputation is another big one, so I only selected brands I personally trust to have great durability and consistently provide the safety they're rated for.</p><p>For child and infant life jackets, leg or crotch straps were a major factor as it's very easy for scrawny and squirmy youngsters to slip out of their PFDs without them. A Type II PFD was also a must for infants and toddlers, so that narrowed the field quite a bit in that category. For the best women's life jacket category, I know a lot of women boaters and aquatic adventurers out there, so it was a simple matter of surveying them for their favorite and least favorite features.</p>"
boot knives,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>While we test a lot of gear here, we love knives. You should check out our extensive reviews of fixed blade, folding, and survival knives. I've previously reviewed the Schrade Frontier survival knife and the CRKT Overland folding knife. My personal interest in boot knives came as I searched for a replacement for a Gerber Guardian boot knife, which I lost years ago on a C130 somewhere in Iraq.</p><p>For this guide, I considered dozens of candidates. When picking knives to test, I used other ""best of"" lists for guidance as well as input from other reviewers. I also relied on my own experience and crowd-sourced information from vendor sites and Amazon. Using that research, I learned what key features make a boot knife ""good.""</p><p>To get the obvious out of the way first, a good boot knife should have the ability to fit comfortably in or on your boot or on your ankle. This limits the overall size of the knife: I limited this list to knives that are nine inches or shorter. Plus, it needs to fit comfortably in your hand (some knives were excluded from this list because of too many complaints that the handle was useless) while still being able to be worn discreetly. Finally, the sheath should lend itself to being securely clipped on the boot, or be easily modified for such use.</p>"
machetes,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I've been collecting and selling knives for nearly a decade and was even a blacksmith's apprentice for a while. I've also written extensively about the subject here. In addition to writing guides about Damascus knives, utility knives, and karambits, I've also reviewed individual blades like the Cold Steel American Lawman, WE Stonefish, Leatherman Curl, Cold Steel Storm Cloud, QSP Penguin, and Spyderco Slip Stone. Bluntly put, I'm a nerd - pun intended.</p><p>For this article, we used recommendations shared in forums around the internet, particularly a handful of Facebook groups for knife enthusiasts. We relied on these sources because the members tend to provide better feedback than what you'd find in product review sections on most knife websites.</p><p>The machetes we selected came highly recommended because of their overall quality and performance. We looked for blades that were durable, versatile, and easy to maintain. We considered things like the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's reputation for quality control. We specifically looked for blades that were corrosion-resistant, either due to them being stainless steel, or having a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Wooden handles were avoided due to their tendency to splinter and retain moisture. Lastly, we eliminated any machetes that had partial tangs or thin rat-tail tangs, due to their tendency to be weaker than full tangs.</p>"
solar watches,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I'm an experienced watch collector who has written multiple articles about the subject. I've written extensively about dive watches and aviation watches. On top of that, if you browse the our library, you'll find several more watch-buying guides covering topics like running watches, survival watches, and even the best tritium watches.</p><p>To find the best solar-powered watches, we bought and wore a variety of solar watches as well as collected input from other watch owners. We relied on people who buy solar watches not just because they want them, but because they know watches. These are people like ""Shane,"" the host of the trusted watch review channel Relative Time.</p><p>In our effort to find the best solar watches, we tested watches for their ability to keep time, and we judged appearance and design by comparing them to luxury watches and how they fit on the wrist. We also gave consideration to watches with original designs or unique features if they also satisfied the other criteria. With that said, in this article you'll find the best watches that use a solar movement, no matter who you are.<br/>Like most of our buyer's guides, we used a combination of hands-on testing and crowdsourced information to deliver a comprehensive product list.

rangefinders for hunting,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Researching rangefinders for hunting was a pretty extensive process, with a lot of fun and interesting rabbit holes to stumble into along the way. Like binoculars, rangefinders can be pretty complicated in their construction alone, having to take into account such aspects as glass quality, glass coatings, magnification powers, objective lens size, housing-case material, and water- and fog-proofing. Fortunately, a lot of this knowledge had already been gathered while researching our binocular recommendations a few months back.</p><p>The real complications come in the features that set rangefinders apart, which are all the electronic gadgetry shooting honest-to-god laser beams, collecting laser beams, and translating laser beams into useful ballistics information. Being a bowhunter, who usually hunts from a treestand in a wooded area with a max shot range of 40 yards, I've never really had much need for ballistics calculations. Fortunately, there are plenty of websites out there that can teach you everything you need to know to make a sound rangefinder pick, such as this informative article from Bushnell.</p><p>Armed with my new knowledge, I scoured other top rangefinder lists and product reviews, while pitting them against the recommendations of fellow hunters in my life. What I've produced is a list I'm confident will help you make a smart decision on the best hunting rangefinder to meet your needs.</p>"
field jackets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When trying to select our suggestions for this article, I looked at what makes a field jacket great: warmth, durability, and lots of pocket space. Historically, the field jacket was supposed to be something a soldier could wear in the field, pockets stuffed full of extra ammo or rations, and keeping the weather off their back. I stuck with companies who have lived up to that expectation historically and products that fit that design philosophy. I also pored over some of the most popular options, some of the most heavily-advertised results on social media and in Google search results, and weeded through those options that were most obviously cheap knock-offs.</p><p>When you've spent enough time outdoors and at hard labor, certain design choices and materials stand out as being of lesser quality. Even beyond my own experience in the U.S. Army, I've spent years personally buying a wide range of jackets from a variety of manufacturers, and have learned some little tricks to be able to tell how a product will perform over the long term. Little things like how a jacket is cut can tell you how much range of motion you're going to get, or what materials let in too much water or don't breathe as well become obvious.</p>"
water purification tablets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I gotta be honest with you: water purification tablets aren't my first choice when moving through the hills. I prefer mechanical means to filter my water - like the GravityWorks Platypus or Katadyn BeFree or the Sawyer Squeeze systems. Sure, they're heavier to carry than a bottle of drops or tablets, and sometimes unnecessary, but in the 30 plus years I've been going to the backcountry, I haven't gotten sick yet. And I'm not saying tablets aren't as good. In many cases they're better, but they too have their downsides. More on that later.</p><p>So, how did I choose products for this review? I went to people who love water purification tablets and asked for their opinions. I read countless reviews and also a bunch of scientific literature on their efficacy. Then I culled that list to the best ones based on a number of criteria. Essentially, I wanted to know several things: 1) Do they kill most of the creepy crawlies that will turn your guts into mud and ruin your day? 2) How long does it take them to work? 3) Do they make water taste ok or like ass afterwards? (You aren't as likely to hydrate with water that repels you.) and 4) Are they simple to use?</p>"
camping knives,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I've been collecting and selling knives for about a decade, and was even a blacksmith apprentice for a while. I've also written extensively about the subject here. In addition to writing guides about Damascus knives, utility knives, and karambit knives, I've also reviewed individual blades like the Cold Steel American Lawman, WE Stonefish, Leatherman Curl, Cold Steel Storm Cloud, QSP Penguin, and Spyderco Slip Stone. Bluntly put, I'm a nerd - pun intended.</p><p>For this article, we used recommendations shared in forums around the internet, particularly a handful of Facebook groups for knife enthusiasts. We relied on these sources because the members tend to provide better feedback than what you'd find in product review sections on most knife websites.</p><p>The knives we selected came highly recommended because of their overall quality and performance. We looked for blades that were durable, versatile, and easy to maintain. We also considered things like the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's reputation for quality control. We specifically looked for blades that were corrosion-resistant, either due to them being stainless steel, or having a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Leather and cloth sheaths were avoided, as were wooden handles, due to their tendency to retain moisture.</p>"
solar generators,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>There was a time when, like most people, we thought solar energy was a simple concept: plug a solar panel into a solar generator and off you go. Enjoy your free electricity. It turns out that there's a lot more to it than that. Solar energy that's collected by one of several kinds of solar panels needs to be regulated to ensure safe delivery into the battery. The solar generator needs to convert stored energy into a form that can be used by devices that consume either alternating- or direct-current electricity.</p><p>To make sure you got solid information, we spent days researching all of this and found some great resources to pass along. Armed with that information, we sought out solar generators that are adequate for several days of use on a single charge. Every product that made our list had to offer AC and DC charging. The ability to charge via solar panels was obviously a must, but we looked for solar generators that can be purchased individually so you have the flexibility to customize a setup to meet your specific needs. Finally, we gave priority to brands that either had a proven record of success or could provide a product for us to test for ourselves.</p>"
tactical knives,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I've been collecting and selling knives for nearly a decade and was even a blacksmith's apprentice for a while. I've also written extensively about the subject here. In addition to writing guides about Damascus knives, utility knives, and karambits, I've also reviewed individual blades like the Cold Steel American Lawman, WE Stonefish, Leatherman Curl, Cold Steel Storm Cloud, QSP Penguin, and Spyderco Slip Stone. Bluntly put, I'm a nerd - pun intended.</p><p>For this article, we used recommendations shared in forums around the internet, particularly a handful of Facebook groups for knife enthusiasts.

Leather sheaths were avoided, as were wooden handles, due to their tendency to retain moisture.</p>"
hiking pants for women,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Unlike in my review of the best running shorts for women, when reviewing different hiking pants for women for this piece, price took more of a back seat to the quality of the pants and their materials. After all, your running shorts will rarely mean the difference between life or death, but your hiking pants impact not only your comfort and enjoyment, but can also prevent you from sliding into hypothermia and even death when the weather turns unexpectedly bad on you. While there are a lot of cheap, non-name brand options for women's hiking pants on sites like Amazon, we aren't fooled when the description says they are waterproof.</p><p>Because of the impact a good pair of hiking pants can have on your safety, how well the pants I reviewed can protect you from the elements was first and foremost in my mind. Other than the one budget winter pair we highlight here that are good enough for occasional, good weather hikers, we did not review products that promised to be waterproof. Instead, my top picks were based on weather resistance, wicking power, design, and durability. Usable pockets got extra stars since women's pants tend to lack them.</p>"
shooting mats,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In this article, we recommend the best shooting mats for use in the field or at the range. Our selections are based on experience with comparable equipment at Gunsite Academy's Long Range Precision Rifle course and extensive research including reviews of manufacturer specifications, professional publications, product videos, and other sources.</p><p>Our research started with identifying the key characteristics essential to the performance of a quality shooting mat, namely dimensions, thickness, material, and weight. These characteristics are discussed in detail later in this article in the section ""What to consider when buying a shooting mat.""</p><p>Our research team then searched for shooting mats on e-commerce websites including Amazon, Cabela's, OpticsPlanet, Brownells, MidwayUSA, and many more, with a focus on selecting those products that offer an optimal balance between design characteristics. The most promising shooting mats were then selected for in-depth research via consumer and independent third-party print and video reviews, as well as discussions within our community of recreational shooters, hunters, and military personnel.</p><p>The final research step leveraged all the data, results, and commentary to develop specific questions for each manufacturer. The answers provided by the manufacturers gave us a better understanding of each shooting mat's performance and helped us develop our final set of recommendations.</p>"
gun cases,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The majority of our review team are either current or former servicemen or hobbyists like me who work in related professions. I'm a former law enforcement officer and lifelong hunter. No matter our profession, we are serious about gear, especially when it comes to gun stuff. We recognize the importance of gun safety and ease of use. We take this approach when we talk about holsters, optics, gun safes, and now gun cases.</p><p>For this guide, I surveyed military personnel, hunters, and other law enforcement officers about the gun cases they use and why. Considering their opinions and my own experiences, I found the best gun cases based on price point, durability, and overall performance in the field - in other words, what I'd want in a gun case.</p><p>Looking for the best gun cases, I searched for the highest-rated and best-selling options by the most popular gun case manufacturers and sellers. After identifying a list of top-tier gun cases, I narrowed my search by reading performance and user reviews.</p><p>When I reviewed performance, I paid close attention to performance and price. I relied on user reviews published on ecommerce sites like Amazon, reviews on independent websites, and my personal experience with the item. </p>"
backpacking meals,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As journalists and fellow adventurers, we always seek to deliver the most informative yet honest reviews possible in every buyer's guide we curate. This guide has been curated mostly through extensive research and deep dives into company specs and, more importantly, real-world consumer experiences. While Amazon continued to serve as a useful encyclopedia of customer input, the widespread availability of backpacking meals has also allowed other sources to aid in curating our guide, including REI, Scheels, Walmart, and numerous food brand websites. Their availability has made it relatively easy for this author to perform some hands-on nitpicking on a few brands.</p><p>Quick stops at my local REI rewarded me with meals from Mountain House and Peak Refuel to sample for this guide, plus a previous guide to survival food kits. I examined taste, how filling they were, and how easy they were to prepare using the recommended methods. As an outdoor specialist, I'm no stranger to MREs either and was able to deliver feedback based on real-world experiences with such items. The best meals sacrificed little-to-none in terms of taste and texture versus something you'd buy in cans from the grocery store while effectively fitting their niche (vegan-friendly or high in calories).</p>"
garmin watches,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Narrowing down the best Garmin watches can be daunting and subjective. In this case, I focused my attention on determining which ones work best in a military context. That might mean navigating uncharted terrain during a deployment to a hostile environment, or it could mean keeping you on pace to crush your annual fitness test. Features like night vision compatibility and stealth mode were given preference, but so were ones like contactless payment and the ability to control your music during a training run on your own time. I did my best to narrow the extensive list of Garmin watches currently available to the best overall, the best on a budget, and the best in two other price categories.</p><p>In the case of the tactix 7 and Instinct 2, I was able to put test units through their paces myself over the span of several months. You'll find specific aspects of those watches that stood out in their respective sections of this gear guide. </p><p>The result of this is a Garmin watch review that's written from a military perspective for people in the military - or those who have separated and are keeping the tradition alive.</p>"
spotlights,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In a perfect world, I would be able to get hands-on with the best spotlights available to put them through rigorous testing and provide you with scientifically measured data to decide on. That just wasn't feasible for this best spotlights review, so instead, I had to rely on my personal experiences in the military and construction worlds. Having used several different types of spotlights gave me a base knowledge to conduct in-depth research to evaluate each product objectively.</p><p>As a writer here, I've developed this skill through articles like the best gun oils, best camping chairs, and best running socks where there are an overwhelming amount of choices. We have covered the illuminating choices for the best 1000 lumen flashlights, headlamps, rechargeable flashlights, and EDC flashlights.</p><p>For this article, I relied heavily on personal experience with brands like DeWalt, Makita, and Streamlight for baseline information. I also compared other buying guides to identify spotlight options that would fit the different categories selected. I avoided spotlights with unrealistic claims, questionable or inconsistent information, and products and brands with known histories of quality control issues. The below result is a selection of the best spotlights you can buy.</p>"
paracords,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Before I even started my search for the best paracords, I took a minute to revisit some of the ways people use the stuff. All of us have probably used 550 cord to build a shelter out of a tarp or tie serialized gear to ourselves (shoutout to my peers who got to participate in the great PEQ-15 search of 2011), but more important tasks include repairing broken gear, building more durable bushcraft shelters, building makeshift tools, and even catching something to eat when the going gets tough. I even took the opportunity to practice some of those skills by upgrading my trusty get-home bag with a paracord-wrapped handle.</p><p>After finding a solid value option for my budget-conscious readers, I dug a little deeper to find more advanced paracord options with higher load ratings and better features. One of my guiding lights was MIL-C-5040H, the U.S. military's standard for paracord construction. The rest of my picks had to meet or exceed that standard. After sifting through what seemed like endless search results of suspect products, I found two that I would trust to get me to the ends of the Earth and back.</p>"
backpack coolers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Having deployed in almost every aspect of Naval Warfare, as well as being an avid outdoorsman, I have an idea of what materials and designs are built to last and perform. I took all that knowledge and came up with a list of the best backpack coolers available today.</p><p>I started my search with trusted brands like Yeti, Coleman, and Igloo. Then, I rounded out the list with some surprises like Icemule, RTIC, and REI - companies you may not recognize as backpack cooler makers. This list has a litany of capabilities, running the gambit from day-use to full-on backcountry adventures. To surmise, I chose the gear that has a good track record and those I would personally want.</p><p>For this review, I tested every backpack hands-on and pitted them against each other to really find out which backpack reigned supreme. If these packs advertised certain capabilities like waterproofing or ice retention, I put them to the test. Every person's needs in a backpack cooler are different, so I made sure to let you know exactly which pursuits the backpack excelled at to narrow your search.</p>"
hunting boots,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Picking a flavor for a single-scoop cone at Baskin-Robbins is easier than picking a hunting boot. With so many combinations of boot types, features, and manufacturers, a filtering process is the only way to avoid true analysis paralysis and willy-nilly purchases. As such, I looked for boots with a combination of comfort, traction, toughness, durability, and weather resistance.</p><p>By nature of living in Colorado, I primarily focused on hiking-style boots designed to take down game commonly found in the West and Midwest (mostly big game, turkey, coyotes, and upland birds). Whenever possible, I tried to find boots with a women's version or direct equivalent, although this was not nearly as easy as it sounds.</p><p>Also, I relied heavily on hands-on reviews and similar written materials to help evaluate each boot. </p>"
aviator sunglasses,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Aviator sunglasses have been around since 1936 when they were developed by Bausch & Lomb to protect pilots' eyes from the harsh glare of the sun at altitude. Generals, actors, and rock stars have made the design a cultural icon for nearly a century. As you can imagine, the style has been picked up by countless manufacturers since then. A quick search on Amazon brought up seven pages of results - most of them from brands I've never heard of.</p><p>Out of respect for your money, I immediately discarded any products from dubious manufacturers and sellers. Only established, trusted names like Ray-Ban and Michael Kors made the cut. Oh, and Jessica Simpson because she did release a tribute to the Top Gun soundtrack back in the day.</p><p>For the most part, I stayed true to the original aviators with the timeless teardrop shape, although I had to make an exception for Ray-Ban's Caravan shades out of respect for Goose's son in the new Top Gun: Maverick movie.</p><p>Finally, I tried to hit a few different price points to put a quality set of aviators in everyone's budget.</p>"
gun belts,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>To build this list, I based it on products that I've personally used, along with interviews with professional end-users and the manufacturers themselves. I limited the belts on this list to tactical nylon ""gunfighter belts"" rather than expanding it to belts for concealed carry, padded ""battle belts,"" and leather duty belts for law enforcement use, simply because of the fact that those are topics in and of themselves, and this list would easily be an entire book if I included all of them.</p><p>You may notice that the Ronin Tactics Senshi belt is not on the list, and that's mostly because Ronin belts are manufactured under contract by AWS, so I'd recommend AWS instead. The GBRS Group Assaulter belt is not on this list because for most users, the advantages over the Ferro Concepts Bison belt are not appreciable, and the Ferro belt is still lighter.</p><p>Finally, I've generally avoided companies that engage in ""drop"" marketing, as end-users who need a quality belt solution sooner rather than later aren't always willing to wait for the next hyper-limited drop.</p>"
generators for camping,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I started my market research by considering why people need generators for camping, to begin with. If all we needed to power was a phone and Bluetooth headphones, we'd use a pocket-sized power bank. Campers in the market for a generator probably need enough energy to power larger devices like a laptop, some lighting, and maybe an electric grill - so that's where my search began. My picks for this list have power capacities from 200 to 3,000 watt-hours.</p><p>I researched how different styles of generators work to understand the advantages and disadvantages of fuel-burning and solar-powered generators. I crowd-sourced reviews of popular models and turned to sources ranging from the U.S. Energy Information Administration to Home Depot to understand where our power comes from and how we use it.</p><p>I prioritized solar generators because they're more environmentally friendly, simpler to operate, and don't constantly consume increasingly expensive fuel. I also focused on manufacturers I know to consistently build quality products. The result is a short but carefully curated list of some of the best generators for camping you can buy right now.</p>"
ghillie suits,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Researching ghillie suits available on the market is an interesting process. For the consumer, there is no lack of options available. Some of these range from products on Amazon that are probably better suited for Halloween to some of the reviewed products that are field-ready. Some of the criteria that I weighed heavily on were durability and construction, breathability, packability, color palette, and application. As an alternative, 3D leaf suit products were also reviewed that are more specific to hunting. Most of this research was conducted through field testing and prior experience.</p><p>The internet is full of forums and articles on ghillies. There's no doubt there exists some great information out there, as well as not-so-great. My experience is diverse, but I don't know everything. For additional reference, I also reached out to others with similar backgrounds like KUIU's Justin Shaffer, who is also a former Army sniper, and Matt Zirnsak from The Push Archery who uses ghillies to hunt turkeys and white-tailed deer. With these additional perspectives, I jumped head-on into product reviews and other top ghillie lists. </p>"
hiking daypacks,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In this article, we recommend the best daypacks for hiking in the field. Our selections are based on personal experience with many different brands over many miles of trails, as well as extensive research of the manufacturer's specifications, professional publications, product videos, and other sources.</p><p>Our research started with identifying the key characteristics essential to the performance of a quality daypack, namely capacity, weight, and fit. These characteristics are discussed above in the section ""Things to consider before buying a daypack.""</p><p>We then searched for daypacks on e-commerce websites including Amazon, REI, Cabela's, Backcountry, Campmor, and others, with a focus on selecting those products that offer an optimal balance between design characteristics. The most promising daypacks were then selected for in-depth research via consumer and independent third-party print and video reviews, as well as discussions within our community.</p><p>The final research step leveraged all the data, results, and commentary to develop specific questions for each manufacturer. The answers provided by the manufacturers gave us a better understanding of each daypack's performance and helped us develop our final set of recommendations.</p>"
biometric gun safes,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As journalists and fellow firearms enthusiasts, it's in our best interest to deliver informative and honest reviews anywhere we can. That said, it would be quite the timely and costly endeavor to get our grubby mitts on a dozen safes, which is why this guide is heavily research-driven. Deep dives into each and every product combined with real-life user experience helped this author determine which would serve discerning enthusiasts the best for each of your specific use cases.</p><p>The best gun safes would be the most robust, make the most efficient use of space, and have easy-to-program biometric scanners with little fuss, an important factor in a relatively cumbersome category of gun safes. Products with little-to-no consumer feedback were ignored in favor of items with real-world customer experiences.</p><p>Amazon served as a major hub of manufacturer specs and consumer feedback on a plethora of products, but quick web searches revealed many more worthwhile products. Because of that, retailers such as Lowes, Home Depot, and Gun Safes were equally valuable sources of product information and ownership experiences.</p>"
hiking boots,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>How does a piece of gear make it onto our list? That's simple - by earning enough of our trust to make us want to use it ourselves. We test a lot of gear. Some of it sticks around and becomes a staff favorite, and some of it can't get sent on its way fast enough. We let you know either way, but these roundups are a great way to find the best of the best all in one place.</p><p>In addition to performing well as a hiking boot, we like to sniff out deals for you. There's no reason to spend more than you need to. Budget options and premium picks make their way to the list, too, but products that pack a ton of value into a small price tag are popular with us. Finally, we like to find products that stand out from the crowd. If a boot offers a particularly interesting feature or offers a unique advantage, that's something we want you to know about.</p>"
ankle holsters,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Like with any rig, choosing a good ankle holster takes time and consideration. Before anything made it onto this list, we took some time to see what features were worth the dough and which ones weren't. Besides the price tag, firearm retention, and stability, comfort was another important consideration. The reality is that if your concealed firearm drops to the floor as soon as you start climbing the stairs, your holster is useless. Of course, a holster that moves throughout the day will lead to an inconsistent, unpredictable draw-increasing variable that will dramatically hinder your draw, and under stress, you may find yourself scrambling for a loose gun rather than engaging the threat.</p><p>As we sifted through various hands-on reviews and other user feedback, we found a handful of sources that provided some valuable insights into the holsters that made our list. In particular, we appreciate the information provided by American Arms, ConcealedCarry.com, Green Light Shooting, Gun News Daily, PilotPatriot, Range 365, Shooting Illustrated, and USA Carry.</p>"
4 season tents,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To narrow down our recommendations for the best 4-season tents, we first considered 24 brands that make reliable camping gear. From here, we honed in on materials that are proven to stand up to rain, wind, and snow, while still being breathable enough to not turn into a sauna come summer temps.</p><p>We also took notes of the materials of the tent poles to compare strength versus weight. Then we dove deeper into the tent's size, how many people each tent slept, the overall weight, and how easy or terrible it was to set up. We also took into account whether each tent had a vestibule for unloaded gear and if it came with its own footprint or if that was a separate purchase. We turned to both customer and expert reviews to compile common praises or complaints.</p><p>All things considered, we pared down our recommendations into categories we thought would serve the reader best. Whenever possible, we test items ourselves to get first-hand experience of how a product performs in the wild.</p>"
winter hiking boots,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>Recommending winter hiking boots isn't as easy as it seems, especially considering the wide variety of terrain and weather conditions a given hiker is likely to encounter in their area of the world. Still, certain features were non-negotiables. All boots on this list met the expectation of possessing proper waterproofing (or long-term water resistance for budget options), proper insulation (minimum of 200 grams), an aggressive tread, a medium to tall shaft rise, a lace-up design, and a reasonable expectation of durability. For all but the budget boots, our choices had to be available in both men's and women's variants.</p><p>I also consulted a number of hands-on reviews to get a better sense of these boots' performance in the wild. In particular, I found the following resources particularly valuable: Backpacker.com (three different articles), Fat-Bike.com, Field & Stream, GearJunkie, Gear Patrol, GearWeAre.com, Guns.com, Outdoor Gear Lab (two articles), Outdoor Life, SectionHiker.com (two articles), Style Altitude, TheShoesFinder, The Fun Outdoors, Tactical Distributors, and Track and Pursue.</p>"
paracord bracelets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I'm a bit of a paracord hobbyist and made my first cobra bracelet in 2009 with OD green 550 cord and a button from a pair of old cammies that I cut the center out of. Since then, I've made bracelets, keychains, dog collars, and a dog leash in varying patterns and colors. Throughout my hobbying, I've spent countless hours reading the resources at Paracord Planet and watching videos by professionals like Weavers of Eternity.</p><p>When selecting the products for this best paracord review, I specifically looked at the quality of each bracelet to see how consistent the weaves are and for a clean finish. I combined my personal knowledge and experience with customer reviews for good measure. The research and selection process was similar to work I've done in my previous articles on backpacking sleeping pads and camping chairs.</p><p>If you're looking to build or improve your survival kits, our library has great selections including emergency food kits, survival radios, wilderness survival books, and, of course, survival knives.</p>"
gun safes under 500,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When looking for a quality gun safe for myself or someone else, I try to find one that's feature-rich but not too expensive. I also consider the purpose of the safe. While they all generally do the same thing, trying to limit access to firearms is different than protecting them.</p><p>For this article, I narrowed my search to safes that are California DOJ-approved since that's where I live, and I figured if something is good enough for California, it should be good enough for wherever you live. I also considered feedback in product reviews and YouTube videos, and I relied on personal experience I've had throughout the years.</p><p>Not all of the safes on this list are meant to withstand being pulled out of the ground and dragged away by thieves with a truck, but they will all offer protection from unauthorized access, at least temporarily. For this review guide, I graded the safes based on cost, features, ease of use, thickness of the walls, and locking mechanisms.</p>"
duffel bags,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>First and foremost, in any buying guide I assemble is what you're going to need to get the job done in all areas of your life. This shapes the categories and gives me a heading when I begin searching the internet.</p><p>We've got a great team here, and for duffel bags, I started with my fellow writers for recommendations and experiences. These added context to my own experiences, which is where I gain a larger perspective. Armed with perspective and categories, I began searching websites like Amazon, Cabelas, Walmart, and even specific manufacturer websites.</p><p>To select the right duffel bags, I relied heavily on industry knowledge and experience around designs and materials. Each duffel was evaluated on its ability to function in the selected category and other performance criteria indicated in the reviews below. I also looked at the brand's reputation and history as an indicator of trustworthiness. Your voice matters, too, and if you've got some experience you'd like to share, please leave a comment below.</p>"
binoculars for hunting,"<h2>How We Chose Our Top Picks</h2><p>When making selections for our list, I pored over tons of online reviews, ""best-of"" lists, and got as much hands-on experience as I could. While I certainly could have skewed our list to the best of the low price binos or the best of the insanely high-priced binos (because there are A LOT out there), I tried to stick with those selections that would be most versatile to the average hunter with an average amount of disposable income.</p><p>For most of us, we aren't out stalking caribou 365 days a year and we may never fly a bush plane into the wild edge of Alaska to tag a bull moose, so it doesn't really make sense to buy hunting binoculars benefitting that type of hunt. For me personally, my binos will get the most bang for their buck if they're suited for whitetail hunting right here in Michigan, so that's the mentality I took when putting this all together.</p>"
cross draw holsters,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Cross-draw holsters are a rare find, but they are expected to do the same job as any other holster. As such, I made sure to find holsters that adhered as closely as possible to John Correia's definition of what makes a good holster. I also hit up the Buckeye Firearms Association, Craft Holsters, Galco, GunDigestTV, hrfunk, JM4 Tactical, and USCCA to supplement what I already knew about cross-draw holsters.</p><p>Next, I combed through Amazon, Optics Planet, and other online retailers, as well as YouTube and internet search engines, to find the best holsters I could find. Videos from Gun Talk Media and other outlets were helpful for getting a sense of each offering.</p><p>Finally, I watched and read a good number of cross-draw holster reviews to verify (or challenge) my initial findings and to get a better sense of the pros and cons of my final selections. I found GunCollector007, The Maglife Blog, Slim Cowboy, and yankeecowboy to be especially helpful in this regard.</p>"
tool subscription boxes,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In selecting the tool subscription companies for this list, we considered several criteria. For a subscription service to be worth the money, it must deliver useful tools, so we only included well-curated boxes of tools, PPE, and supplies with minimal inclusion of useless extras. Quality is also important, so we limited our picks mainly to subscription boxes that included recognizable name brands. Finally, we considered subscription boxes that offer the best bang for the buck without lofty additional shipping fees.</p> <h2>Tips on Choosing the Best Tool Subscription Box</h2> <p>When sifting through the best tool boxes that offer subscriptions, it’s vital to consider what’s inside. Though none of these services will tell you exactly what you’ll be getting, most focus on specific items. One service may provide strictly hand tools while others may include PPE, consumable supplies like wood glue and varnish, and swag, such as T-shirts and hats. Choose the subscription box that best meets your needs. When it comes to tools, brand is paramount, so look closely at the manufacturers included in the kit. Household names such as Milwaukee, DeWalt, and Bosch indicate higher quality than boxes that include no-name brands. Frequency is also important. In addition to looking at the price of the kit, consider how often the kit is delivered as well as any delivery fees that are tacked on.</p> <ul><li>Look at the types of tools and supplies included in the box.</li><li>Choose subscription boxes that feature reputable tool manufacturers.</li><li>Consider shipping fees as well as subscription prices.</li></ul>"

ozone generator,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after ozone generators in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, ozone emission levels, size and weight, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best ozone generators available, the cold plasma options proved the most popular for their ease of use and effectiveness. Though not as popular, the ultraviolet option included is also a viable option for its high ozone emission and allergy-control capabilities. No matter the type, the above list features options with 50 to 20,000 mg/hr ozone emission levels depending upon your space and preference.</p> <p>The vast majority of our picks are also compact and lightweight enough to be transported or moved from room to room.

gardening books,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>With thousands of gardening books to choose from, stretching back many, many years, we set a few criteria to limit our choices. The best gardening book to improve your green thumb should cover either broadly relevant gardening basics that any prospective grower should learn, or they should offer solutions to gardening problems. Some may offer both. In either case, the information must be scientifically accurate and up to date.</p> <p>We reached out to dozens of gardeners to find out which books they found most helpful as they were starting out, especially their picks as the best gardening books for beginners. Next we scoured the New York Times best sellers lists for the past three decades. We also checked in with a local librarian to find out what’s on the shelves and which titles see the most action. After compiling our master list, we eliminated anything out of print, outdated, or unrelated to our criteria.</p> <p>There were still more books than we could list here, making it difficult to narrow down the best gardening books of all time. Our final picks favored organic growing practices because the literature emphasizes an ecosystem approach to gardening that gives the reader a fuller understanding of gardening’s big picture. If you want to learn more about things like beneficial microbes in soil or garden predator-prey relationships, the best resources come from the organic realm at this time, making them good options for those interested in backyard gardening books.</p>"
coffee percolators,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the best coffee percolators in a variety of categories from reputable brands with high customer satisfaction. The featured list takes into account the type of coffee maker, brew method, brew capacity, material, and special features included by top brands.</p> <p>In selecting the top coffee makers, we made sure to include both stovetop and electric options that produce coffee using either the gravity or pressure method. We chose coffee makers containing stainless steel or aluminum for durability and longevity. The top picks range from 8-cup to 12-cup models to accommodate different user needs. Additionally, we prioritized models with convenient features like easy-pour spouts and heat-resistant handles.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Coffee Percolator</h2> <p>There are numerous reasons to brew your java with a coffee percolator. These coffee makers have some shared benefits, and others depend on the type or brewing method:</p> <ul><li>Percolators let you enjoy coffee at a fraction of the cost compared to a coffee shop.</li><li>They produce a stronger, more full-bodied brew than a drip coffee maker.</li><li>Higher brewing temperature removes some of the impurities in ground coffee, enhancing the aroma.</li><li>They can easily be cleaned by rinsing with water or using the dishwasher.</li><li>Pressure percolators (Moka pots) allow you to brew espresso-style coffee without buying an expensive espresso machine.</li><li>Stovetop percolators can be used on a variety of heating elements, so they’re great for camping, hiking, and travel when there is no access to electricity.</li></ul>"
pond liners,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home improvement as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 pond liner options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: The best material for a pond liner varies depending on different factors and consumer preferences, so we included products made of a host of materials among our recommendations.</li><li>Thickness: Though thickness isn’t necessarily an indicator of quality when it comes to pond liners, we still opted to include only models with a minimum thickness of 14 mils.</li><li>Flexible vs. preformed: Both flexible and preformed pond liners have their own advantages, so we included options for both types in this guide.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Installing Pond Liners</h2> <p>Once you’ve designed your pond, dug it out, and chosen a liner, it’s time for the installation process to begin. Here are some tips for installing pond liners:</p> <ul><li>Place a layer of sand down before installing the liner to protect it from sharp rocks and roots.</li><li>Consider using an underlay to add further cushioning.</li><li>Drape the liner over the pond, ensuring an equal overhang on all sides before securing the edges with bricks, rocks, or other heavy materials.</li><li>Fill the pond with water, allowing it to fill the contours of the shape dug for it naturally.</li><li>Once the pond has been filled, trim the excess liner and anchor the edges by burying them or holding them down with stones.</li></ul>"
ryobi pressure washers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>With the dozens of gas and electric Ryobi pressure washers on today’s market, it can be difficult to narrow the field. We evaluated and identified some of the best options based on the typical types of jobs required around a home.</p> <p>We chose heavy-duty and medium-duty gas-powered models with higher combined psi and GPM capabilities. Electric pressure washers excel for light- to medium-duty cleaning tasks in which more powerful gas machines might damage sensitive surfaces. We also included a budget-friendly, lightweight, compact electric model suitable for small tasks and storage spaces. These models represent functionality and value within each category.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Ryobi Pressure Washer </h2> <p>Ryobi pressure washers are designed to be durable and easy to use. For best results, follow the assembly, operating, and care instructions that come with the machine.</p> <p>The following are general best practices for cleaning with a pressure washer.</p> <ol><li>Position the pressure washer in a central location.</li><li>Unroll the pressure hose, eliminate any kinks, and connect to the washer and spray gun/wand.</li><li>Select and install a spray tip on the wand and lock the trigger in the “off” position.</li><li>Connect the water supply and, if applicable, the power cord.</li><li>Fill the soap tank with a pressure-washing solution (should have a water-like consistency).</li><li>First turn on the water supply and then the pressure washer.</li><li>When finished, turn off the pressure washer first and then the water supply.</li><li>Disconnect and drain the pressure hose for storage.</li></ol>"
gas lawn mower,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched some of the best-selling gas lawn mowers from such major retailers as The Home Depot, Amazon, and Tractor Supply Co. in order to produce our list of the top gas-powered lawn mowers. Our research focused on three major attributes: deck size, engine size, and cutting functions. Gas lawn mowers are a rather broad classification, so we broke the mowers down into smaller, manual push-behind models suitable for smaller yards; self-propelled lawn mowers for medium-size yards; and riding lawn mowers for large yards in order to get a suitable comparison.</p> <p>Engine size was crucial to our selection process. While a 125 cc engine is capable of powering a gas mower, mowers with these smaller engines can struggle to power broader cutting decks through thicker grass. The best gas lawn mowers have engines large enough to power their respective mowing decks. We selected mowers with at least 140 cc engines for mowers with 21-inch decks. Having the options to mulch and bag are also crucial. When possible, we leaned toward models that offer at least two out of the three cutting options (side discharge, mulching, bagging).</p> <p>Our rankings also took into account the reputation of the brand. We selected well-regarded brands that have been in the business for decades such as Toro, Honda, and Cub Cadet. All of the brands represented on our list have well-established reputations for producing quality gas lawn mowers.</p>"
weed killers for bermuda grass,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In choosing the best weed killers for Bermuda grass lawns, we focused on ingredients that are known to kill a variety of weeds, such as 2,4-D, while leaving Bermuda grass unharmed.</p> <p>We also looked at products that prevent weed seeds from sprouting, known as pre-emergent herbicides. These products form a barrier on the surface of the soil that lasts anywhere from 2 to 4 months. The downside is that while pre-emergents stop weed seeds from germinating, they also prevent beneficial seeds from germinating, so they should not be used before reseeding a lawn.</p> <p>When choosing the products, we placed a lot of value on reputable brands, such as Ortho. Still, we didn’t automatically exclude smaller or niche brands if they contained ingredients known to be effective and if former buyers had good experiences with them.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Weed Killers for Bermuda Grass</h2> <p>Treat the lawn with a selective weed killer at the first sign of weeds. When caught early, weeds don’t have time to spread, so they’ll do less damage to the lawn. In addition:</p> <ul><li>Choose a product such as 2,4-D that won’t damage Bermuda grass.</li><li>Consider applying a pre-emergent before common weeds, such as dandelions, go to seed in your region.</li><li>If you spot one or two rogue weeds that escaped the weed killer, spray them individually with a ready-to-use selective weed killer safe for use on Bermuda grass.</li></ul>"
air purifier for allergies,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Those who suffer from allergies know that the right air purifier can ease respiratory problems while creating peace of mind. Selections for the best air purifiers for allergies depended upon their filtration type, square feet covered, noise level, airflow and filtration settings, and added special features included by select brands.</p> <p>We researched the most sought-after air filtration systems in their respective categories and discovered that activated-carbon, UV, and HEPA air purifiers were among the most popular filtration types on the market. Not only do these types reduce the dust, pollen, and volatile organic compounds in your home’s air, but select models are also capable of reducing odors and eliminating toxic particles of 0.1 microns in size.</p> <p>With this efficiency, keep in mind that many of the above picks are made for a certain size of space, ranging from 185 to 1,060 square feet depending upon where filtration is needed. Most also come with noise levels under 59 dB (which is the volume of a typical conversation) and as low as 17 decibels (which is nearly silent). For added convenience, many air purifiers come with multiple modes or settings including an automatic or night mode.</p> <p>Finally, some of the above air purifiers are made with multistep filtration, are compatible with mobile apps, have built-in air pollution sensors, or are portable air cleaners that can be moved from room to room.</p>"
camping lantern,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We tried to cover all the bases when choosing the best camping lanterns. First, we called upon our experiences as campers and adventurers to select the most important features campers need in a lantern.</p> <p>Next, we performed extensive product research, comparing features like runtime, output, battery source, and weather resistance, which helped us narrow the field. We then assigned awards based on each lantern’s strengths to help streamline the shopping process.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Camping Lantern</h2> <p>Proper lighting on a campsite helps keep everyone safe. Campsites are rarely perfectly flat, and most have roots and rocks that create serious tripping risks. The best camping lanterns illuminate these hazards in the dark.</p> <p>The best camping lanterns can extend the day for friends and loved ones even after the sun goes down and the fire goes out. Lanterns light the way to prepare food, play games, or relax and swap stories. They’re even useful in the backyard at home.</p> <p>A camping lantern can also make a great emergency lantern. Since these lanterns are rugged enough for the great outdoors, they can serve as backup lights and power sources during major storms and other natural disasters.</p> <ul><li>Camping lanterns illuminate rocks and roots on a dark path.</li><li>Lanterns extend the day on a camping trip.</li><li>A camping lantern can act as a backup energy and light source during a power outage or storm.</li></ul>"
seed starting mix,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after seed starting mixes in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their ingredients, form, quantity provided, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best seeding mix available, the most effective and popular types among users for outdoor and indoor plant growth were potting soil mixes, pods, and sponges. These mixes included coconut coir, sphagnum peat moss, perlite, fertilizer, wetting agents, and even compost.</p> <p>The seeding mixes allow for drainage, water-retention, root cutting, and transplanting while young seeds begin to grow. Many come with large quantities of up to 16 quarts or 50 pods or sponges. Plus, the majority of these picks are 100 percent certified organic seed starters.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Seed-Starting Mix</h2> <p>Use a seed-starting mix rather than soil or potting mix to increase seed germination and get tiny seedlings off to a healthy start. Employ these tips to simplify the process and increase success.</p> <ul><li>Empty dry mix in a large bowl and stir in water to moisten the mixture before filling a seed flat or seed pots with the mix.</li><li>If the tap water is high in mineral content, consider using distilled water to avoid creating a high alkaline pH environment.</li><li>Consider wearing a dust mask when working with a dry seed-starting mix since some contain powdery, fine elements that can become airborne.</li></ul>"
soil for strawberries,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We extensively researched dozens of potting soil blends to come up with the products for this lineup. To make the cut, a potting soil product had to drain well, since strawberries don’t like sitting in water, but it also had to retain a bit of moisture between waterings and resist compaction.</p> <p>In addition, we considered the manufacturer’s reputation. While Miracle-Gro, nationally known for producing high-quality gardening products, is highly regarded, we also included some smaller companies that create high-quality premium mixes. We eliminated soil mixes that retained too much or too little moisture. The result is a lineup of top-notch products that can grow flavorful strawberries.</p> <h2>Tips to Prepare Soil for Strawberries</h2> <p>Whether planted in a garden, raised bed, or container, it pays to prepare the soil for growing strawberries in advance and make provisions for drainage.</p> <ul><li>When growing strawberries in a container, place 1 or 2 inches of gravel at the bottom of the pot. Then fill the container with your chosen grow mix.</li><li>Test the soil pH in a garden or raised bed to determine if it’s within the optimal range of 5.5 to 6.8 on the pH scale. If not, follow the amendment recommendations that come with the tester to improve the acid/alkaline balance.</li><li>Add a balanced all-purpose fruit-and-vegetable fertilizer to the soil before planting if not using potting soil that contains nutrients or added fertilizers.</li></ul>"
moving straps,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Moving straps provide a convenient, hassle-free way to move heavy electronics and furniture without the cost of a moving company’s help. The above picks were selected based on a variety of factors including ease of use, weight capacity, materials used, and thoughtful construction.</p> <p>Some of the above options come with adjustable harnesses or arm loops which can prevent damage to your legs, back, and knees. While the harnesses offer hands-free potential for opening doors or supporting the carried object, the arm loops can offer quick height adjustments as you move. The above selections also have straps with 2-inch to 3-inch widths for added stability and comfort.</p> <p>These top picks also prioritize weight capacity with some options being able to hold 600- to 800- pound objects. Finally, some of these options come with padded straps, adjustable strap lengths, or protective/reinforced liners for comfort and security.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Moving Straps</h2> <p>Moving straps are handy in a number of situations, not just when you’re moving from one house to another. Many people benefit from having them available for unexpected moving projects around the house or even around the neighborhood.</p> <ul><li>Move the largest items in the house with yourself and a partner.</li><li>Manage heavy, awkward items without strain or injury to the back and shoulders.</li><li>Some moving strap designs allow a single user to move bulky items alone.</li></ul>"
echo chainsaws,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In creating our list of the top Echo chainsaws, we included models that suit a broad range of needs. For the average yard, we chose 14- and 16-inch chainsaws that can handle pruning and taking out the occasional small tree. For larger yards, we include Echo’s 18-inch chainsaws. For those with wooded properties or more acreage, we included chainsaws with cutting bars of 20 inches and above. For those in search of a low-maintenance, easy-to-start chainsaw, we also included one of Echo’s battery-powered models.</p> <h2>Maintenance Tips for an Echo Chainsaw</h2> <p>Chainsaws can be notoriously finicky, failing to start in cold weather or stalling while cutting. To make sure your Echo gas chainsaw stays in top working order, follow a few maintenance guidelines. Clean the air filter regularly as it can fill up with dirt, which can hurt performance or even damage the engine. To extend the life of the cutting bar, rotate the bar on each use. Also, inspect the chain lubrication hole to make sure it isn’t clogged, and periodically clean the bar groove. Check regularly for proper chain tension and tighten if necessary. Finally, chainsaws create a lot of vibration that can loosen bolts. Check all bolts and tighten any if necessary.</p> <ul><li>Clean the air filter regularly</li><li>Inspect the lubrication hole for clogs</li><li>Clean the bar groove</li><li>Check for proper chain tension</li><li>Tighten any loose bolts</li></ul>"
fertilizer for indoor plants,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide.

eco friendly laundry detergents,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We made our picks for the best eco-friendly laundry detergents based on their ingredients, including whether they contained scents and if those scents were exclusively naturally derived. We also picked them based on consumer reviews of which products were the most effective without irritating the skin or containing strong scents. Many of these eco-friendly laundry detergents are fragrance-free as well, for those who need to avoid fragrances of any kind. All the detergents we reviewed were also cruelty-free, meaning the products were not tested on animals.</p> <h2>Eco-Friendly Laundry Tips</h2> <p>The best laundry soap won’t be the same for every consumer, since people use different machine types, have varying preferences for warm or cold water, and might need more or less stain-fighting power. Our eco-friendly laundry tips should help get the most out of a new laundry detergent, whether using it individually, for family, or for pets.</p> <ul><li>Always follow the directions for use and note if a product is better for a high-efficiency machine.</li><li>For those who have hard water, it may be best to follow up with the manufacturer to make sure the product you’re considering is the best laundry detergent for hard water. Washing clothes in hard water may require using a different product.</li><li>Know whether having a detergent with enzymes is important for removing stains.</li></ul>"
seed starting trays,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home improvement and gardening as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide on the best seed starting trays. We explored more than 25 seed tray options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: Both plastic and biodegradable seed trays have their own advantages, so we opted to include examples of both among our recommendations.</li><li>Capacity: Seed starting trays vary widely when it comes to their capacity. We included both large and small trays in our top picks in order to provide options for most home gardeners.</li><li>Cell size: Cell sizes on seed starting trays vary, but we opted to exclude any trays with depths of more than 3 inches because they tend to drain poorly.</li></ul> <h2>Advantages of Using Seed Starting Trays</h2> <p>While it’s possible to germinate seeds in nearly any kind of container, using a seed starting tray makes the process simpler, tidier, and easier to maintain. Here are some advantages of using a seed starting tray.</p> <ul><li>Seed trays line up the seedlings in rows, making them easier to heat or water evenly.</li><li>Seed trays are easy to move around and can be brought outdoors once the weather is favorable.</li><li>Seed trays feature drainage holes, which allow the soil or seed starting mix to drain effectively.</li></ul>"
attic ladder,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To put together this list of the best attic ladders, it was necessary to research more than 30 products. Attic ladders are used for accessible ingress to the attic and egress from the attic, so they need to be able to support the weight of the user and provide enough space for the average person to move freely up and down.</p> <p>Convenience and portability also factor into the product design. For instance, an electric steel scissor attic ladder can fold up into the attic or fold down with the touch of a button. However, it’s more common to see manual pull-down ladders that can be released by hand or with an assist pole, then when the user is done with the ladder, it folds up into the attic space.</p> <p>Telescoping ladders may also slide up into the attic or they could be portable models that can be tucked into a closet when the ladder isn’t required. The ceiling height was also a consideration during the selection process because if the ladder doesn’t reach the ground or extends too far, it won’t work for the given space. If a product had additional features, such as textured steps to help prevent slips, it typically stood out from similar attic ladders that lacked these extra features.</p>"
fertilizers for corn,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 20 fertilizer options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Organic vs. inorganic: Since there are advantages to both organic and inorganic fertilizers, we included both types in this guide.</li><li>NPK ratio: Since corn has unique needs in terms of macronutrients, we include both formulas for pre-planting fertilization and side-dressing.</li><li>Value: Plant fertilizers vary widely in type and quantity. We ensured that each recommended product offered excellent value, regardless of the format.</li></ul> <h2>Tips on How to Fertilize Corn</h2> <p>While you may have now chosen the best corn fertilizer for your crop, there are still some important tips when it comes to how to use it. The following pointers should ensure that your corn plants are properly fertilized and that they produce a bountiful harvest.</p> <ul><li>Each fertilizer has specific application instructions; be sure to follow the directions on the label.</li><li>Avoid spraying fertilizer on the corn’s leaves, especially if it contains a high percentage of nitrogen.</li><li>After planting, fertilize corn using a side-dressing technique.</li><li>When using granular fertilizers, ensure they’re thoroughly mixed into the soil.</li><li>Always water the plants when applying fertilizer.</li><li>Stop fertilizing corn when the ears begin to show silk.</li></ul>"
welding boots,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Any time an item or article of clothing is required to keep an individual safe during a specific task, the primary factor for consideration needs to be the ability of the product to protect the user. With this in mind, we conducted extensive research to find the top choices for this list from more than 35 options. Safety was the priority during the selection process, but it was also necessary to consider the available sizes, types, construction, and any additional features that could help a pair of welding boots stand out from similar products.</p> <p>The best welding boots needed to be able to protect the wearer adequately from flame, heat, and molten-metal spatter. To achieve this level of protection, the products we selected were typically made with heat-resistant leather and had a safety toe cap. Some welding boots also came with a metatarsal guard to prevent damage to the top of the wearer’s foot.</p> <p>Laced and pull-on welding boots were both included in the list of the best boots for welding in men’s and women’s options because individuals may have different preferences based on type. While laces can pose a fire risk during welding, making the switch to pull-on boots may not be a choice some people are willing to make.</p>"
halloween decorations,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>While it’s easy to assume that all Halloween decorations offer similar performance, a number of factors affect their functionality. Several years of experience covering products for the home as well as extensive product research went into choosing our final curated selections. We reviewed over 100 Halloween decorations and weighed a number of practical considerations when making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Variety: Unlike many other types of products, there’s a nearly infinite amount of variety when it comes to Halloween decorations. We aimed to include products that would suit different themes as well as a mix of indoor and outdoor decorations.</li><li>Reviews: Since so many Halloween decorations are only available seasonally and change from year to year, it can be difficult to find products with more than a handful of ratings or reviews. Still, we did give priority to products that were well reviewed, and, when reviews weren’t available, we made sure to showcase decorations by reputable brands that consistently put out high-quality products.</li><li>Value: We took into consideration the fact that Halloween decorations are only on display for a few weeks each year, so shopping on a budget is essential for many households. We only included products that offered great value and were high quality enough to withstand several years of use.</li></ul>"
couches for dogs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>During our research, we reviewed dozens of the best couches for dog owners. When choosing a sofa for a dog owner, it’s not as simple as selecting any couch and letting a pet curl up on it. Here are some of the criteria we assessed in curating our list of recommendations:</p> <ul><li>We picked dog-friendly couches that are supportive, but soft. Just like people, pets need a cozy place to sit that doesn’t put pressure or strain on their bodies. We looked at cushion thickness, foam filling, and spring structure to determine which would be most comfortable for a pet.</li><li>Quality always ranks high on our list. Couches constructed with sturdy frames, reliable joinery, comfortable foam, and durable materials and upholstery helped inform our selections.</li><li>Reputable brand names are always known in their industry for a reason. Our picks include selections from top brands in the home furniture sector who have a proven track record.</li><li>We also reviewed weight capacity, giving favor to couches that support the weight of a large dog and one person (or more).</li><li>Design always plays a part, especially with a large home furnishing like a sofa. Once we determined that a couch was dog-friendly, we only added it to our list if it was also aesthetically pleasing.</li></ul>"

fertilizers for apple trees,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We conducted extensive research into dozens of today’s best-selling brands of fruit-tree fertilizers when considering the top picks for this list. We looked closely at national brands with stellar reputations, such as Jobe’s and Miracle-Gro. Still, we didn’t automatically eliminate smaller or niche brands if their products contained the nutrients known to boost apple tree health.</p> <p>We looked at both synthetic and natural formulations, and we considered price as well as buyer satisfaction.</p> <p>To make our final cut, the products also had to be straightforward and relatively easy to apply. We allowed for some measuring and mixing, but we didn’t select products that required calculating complex formulas or those unsuited to both young and mature apple trees.</p> <h2>Tips for When to Fertilize Apple Trees</h2> <p>It’s a rare soil that naturally provides all the nutrients an apple tree needs to produce a bountiful harvest. Knowing when to fertilize fruit trees is key. The following tips can help.</p> <ul><li>Fertilize an apple tree right after transplanting it to help it develop a robust root system.</li><li>Fertilize young apple trees that have not yet reached their mature height in the spring and again in the fall after the leaves have dropped.</li><li>Mature apple trees only need one feeding per year, in spring.</li></ul>"
gas fireplace insert,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Personal taste is a major factor when choosing things like gas fireplace inserts, but we have tried to remain objective and include a broad range of styles. We researched products from as many different brands as we were able to find, from major retailers to less well-known suppliers.</p> <p>We have been careful to avoid focusing only on the leading brands and to include a varied model lineup. We looked at heating performance, flue type (which impacts ease of installation), and a variety of user-friendly features. The result is a balanced selection for different-size spaces and budgets.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Gas Fireplace Inserts</h2> <p>Real wood fires will always have a certain appeal. Electric models are the ultimate in ease of use, but the lack of real flame means they are not to everyone’s taste. For many people, a gas fireplace insert is the perfect compromise.</p> <ul><li>Efficiency ratings upward of 70 percent make for far superior heat generation and lower fuel consumption when compared with open fires.</li><li>Vented gas inserts are normally reasonably easy to install. Vent-free models can go almost anywhere.</li><li>Gas fireplace inserts are easy to live with. They provide warmth almost instantly, can benefit from thermostatic control, and are a breeze to keep clean.</li></ul>"
socket set,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Before attempting to select the top socket sets, it was important to research and review each individual product from over 30 possible choices. This extensive research helped us determine the products that stood out based on the number of pieces in the set, finish, drive size, versatility, and any special features that made a product stand out from similar options.</p> <p>When examining the number of pieces in a set, a key consideration was the quality or value of each piece. Some sets were dropped from the selection because they had a large number of miscellaneous parts and a small number of actual sockets. The chrome or black oxide finish was used to help differentiate the regular sockets from impact sockets, while ⅜ inch was the most important drive size for a set to have due to the commonality of this size.</p> <p>However, if a socket set had more than one drive size or if it had a variety of sockets, including SAE, metric, shallow, or deep sockets, then these factors counted toward overall versatility. The last component of the selection process was the special features or accessories. Socket sets with specialized tools or parts were typically preferred over similar products that lacked these accessories.</p>"

wax warmer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after types of wax warmers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their size, power source, wax capacity, materials, warming type, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best wax warmers on the market, the most popular type among users were ones with electrical cords for their portability and ease of use. While not as popular, wax warmers with a wall outlet power source are viable options to melt wax cubes and tarts as well as essential oils. No matter the type, each of the above options are all small and light enough to fit in any space and hold enough wax to produce a fragrant aroma wherever they are placed.</p> <p>As for aesthetics, the above options are made of metal, ceramic, glass, and wood to match your home’s fixtures and rely on either a bulb or heating element to produce warmth.

robot vacuums for hardwood floors,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Modern robot vacuums have become more affordable and more reliable—there’s never been a better time to try one of these dirt-banishing machines. We researched dozens of robot vacuums and scrutinized product specs to find the best picks for hardwood floors.</p> <p>When it comes to cleaning, every home has different needs. To cater to a variety of shoppers, we included different vacuums to suit a range of common desires, like picking up after pets or dual-purpose vacuuming and mopping.</p> <p>We looked at the vacuum design, runtime, capacity, and additional convenience features, like mapping capabilities, cleaning modes, smart connectivity, and more to find well-rounded and practical vacuums.

offset smoker,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Selecting the top offset smokers from a range of options was difficult, but with extensive research into each product, it was possible to put together this highly selective list of options. Before beginning the selection process, we determined the weight, portability, cooking area, material construction, and fuel type of each product.</p> <p>Weight and portability were linked since heavier grills become more difficult to manage, even when they are equipped with wheels. The cooking area averaged more than 500 square inches, though some products were highlighted because they sacrificed cooking area for a high level of portability. Other options had a much larger cooking area, making them ideal for large get-togethers, gatherings, and parties. Most of these offset smokers have powder-coated steel construction, though some products did use stainless steel as an alternative.</p> <p>It was also important to note the type of fuel, especially if the offset smoker used charcoal because the temperature of these grills needs to be manually controlled by adjusting intake and exhaust dampers. While some people have the experience necessary to work with charcoal offset smokers, they can be difficult for inexperienced users, so these products were not viewed as beginner-friendly.</p>"
led light bulbs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In our research, we evaluated dozens of the best LED light bulbs on the market but kept coming back to which ones seemed best for a home.

whole house water filter,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A whole-house filtration system provides enhanced water quality for better tasting and smelling drinking water, and prevents harmful minerals and toxins from polluting your water supply. Selections for the best options available depended upon type, flow rate, filtration, compatibility with household water systems, the longevity of the filter’s cartridges, and ease of installation.</p> <p>As the type of water filter greatly influences the level of filtration included, the above list has prioritized 1-stage, 2-stage, and 3-stage options for different levels of filtration and personal preference. With these types in mind, many of the above models come with varying flow rates of 3 to 20 GPM depending upon an individual home’s water consumption. The above water filters also vary between 1-inch and ¾-inch inlets or connections to be compatible with your home’s current water system.</p> <p>Cartridges are also key in whole-house water filtration systems, which is why most last anywhere between 3 month and 1 year depending upon water consumption and filtration type. Finally, each of the above water filtration systems is easy or moderately difficult to install. But, most come with informational guides and kits which should make the process easier.</p>"
welding jackets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Safety was the primary factor of importance when it came to selecting this list of the best welding jackets. If a product could not keep the user safe while they were welding, then it did not qualify for consideration. During the selection process, it was necessary to conduct extensive research on over 30 different welding jackets, including cotton, leather, and hybrid options, in order to find the top welding jackets that stood out from competitors.</p> <p>As mentioned, the main consideration for selection was safety. With this in mind, the material and construction of the welding jackets served as a basis for determining how each product would hold up during different welding operations. Cotton jackets were more vulnerable to the high temperatures produced by heavy stick and MIG welding, while leather and hybrid jackets could deal with heavy stick, MIG, and TIG welding without a problem.</p> <p>Availability of sizes also factored into the final selection because it’s important to find products that fit properly. Otherwise, an oversize jacket may shift and leave your skin exposed or a welding jacket that is too small could ride up, exposing your wrists or forearms.</p>"
christmas stockings,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Our curated selection was developed based on several years of experience testing and reviewing home products as well as extensive product research. After considering over 50 potential options of varying styles and sizes, we narrowed down our choices to this list of top products. We weighed a number of practical considerations when making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: Christmas stockings are made from either natural materials like cotton and wool or synthetic fibers like polyester and acrylic. We gave a slight preference to stockings made with natural materials because of their quality and longevity, but we also included synthetic options in our picks because they’re more affordable and can be just as well made.</li><li>Hanging loop: A hanging loop is necessary for hanging stockings from a mantel. We considered only stockings that included a loop.</li><li>Care requirements: Due to their knit designs and intricate embellishments, most Christmas stockings on the market are not machine washable. The listings will typically stipulate whether the stocking can be hand washed, spot cleaned, or dry cleaned. Because most stockings we considered featured these care requirements, we didn’t rule out any models due to their laundering instructions.</li></ul>"
gas range,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Having enough cooking space, burners, and temperature ranges in a gas range can make cooking small and large dinners faster and more convenient. Selections for the best gas ranges depended upon size, BTUs provided, number of burners, and other cooking features included in select models.</p> <p>Though freestanding models are the most popular on the above list, these options as well as the slide-in gas ranges come with 4 to 6 burners for cooking multiple foods at once.

vanity mirrors with lights,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 40 lighted mirror options and weighed a number of practical considerations before choosing our recommendations.</p> <p>While there are mirrors on the market that require incandescent or fluorescent light bulbs, we focused on models that use LED bulbs because of their energy efficiency and ability to mimic different lighting conditions. Most high-quality lighted vanity mirrors include dimmable lights, allowing the user to operate them at full brightness to create the effects of bright natural or artificial lighting, or dim them as needed.</p> <p>The best lighted mirror for applying makeup allows the user to control the color temperature of the bulbs. Color temperature is measured in Kelvins (K), with higher numbers (in the 6,000K range) mimicking cool daylight and lower numbers (around 3,000K) creating a warm candlelight effect.</p> <p>Some of the lighted mirrors making this list offer smart features, like phone charging, which might be important to a user’s morning routine. Anti-fog properties also are good features to consider when selecting a bathroom mirror with lights.</p>"

steamers for bed bugs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A bed bug infestation should not be taken lightly. These small pests can cause great physical and emotional anguish.

We chose only bed bug steamers that are up to this tough job.</p> <p>Each steamer on this list meets or exceeds the minimum requirements to kill bed bugs. They produce a consistent stream of steam at a minimum temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit or more. We chose products from reputable brands and paid attention to consumer feedback to ensure a good, stable jet of steam that doesn’t sputter or spray.</p> <p>Steaming for bed bugs is slow work, so a comfortable and user-friendly design topped our priority list. We chose steamers with long hoses, wide nozzle options, and a long steam time to make the job less tedious.</p> <p>Lastly, steam cleaners are useful for much more than exterminating bed bugs. They can clean and disinfect throughout the home, so we chose versatile options with plenty of accessories to give you more bang for your buck.</p>"
artificial christmas tree,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Several years of experience covering products for the home as well as extensive product research went into choosing our final curated selection. We reviewed more than 30 Christmas trees and weighed a number of practical considerations when making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Storage: One of the biggest downsides of an artificial tree is that you have to store it when the holiday season is over. We prioritized models that are easy to disassemble into smaller segments for easy storage.</li><li>Reviews: Since so many artificial Christmas trees are available only seasonally and styles change from year to year, it can be difficult to find products with a large number of ratings or reviews from some top retailers. Still, we gave priority to products that received good reviews, and when they weren’t available, we made sure to showcase decorations by reputable brands that consistently produce high-quality products.</li><li>Value: When considering up-front cost, artificial trees may seem expensive. Considering that you can use them for a decade or longer, however, their value becomes apparent. We considered cost when making our recommendations and ensured all our choices offered excellent value.</li></ul>"
grub killer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>These recommendations for the best grub control products include a variety of products to meet the grub-killing needs of typical users who want to maintain an insect-free residential landscape. We narrowed our research to focus primarily on granular grub killers, as those are some of the most popular on the market due to their versatility and effectiveness. However, we found that one liquid grub killer ranked highest for ease of use.</p> <p>We also evaluated the grub killers based on how long each product stays in or on the ground and grass and if they kill on-contact or systemically, as many kill grubs on-contact and continue to last all season long. Plus, some of these products are capable of covering 5,000 square feet or more, killing grubs throughout lawns and gardens and simultaneously fertilizing the space.</p> <p>While there are a broad number of grub killers ranked on our list that can work quickly and have long-lasting effects, others are designed for killing insects such as ticks, Japanese beetles, crickets, ants, and many more to reduce grub damage and crate an overall insect-free landscape.</p>"
pocket knife,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To put together this list of the top pocket knives, it was necessary to research over 40 different products, each with benefits and drawbacks that were important to note and fully understand before the best options could be selected. During the selection process, several key factors needed to be considered, including the blade material, blade length, knife length, locking mechanism, blade shape, weight, balance, and purpose.</p> <p>Stainless steel and carbon steel blades are equally effective, though stainless steel is the preferred material for wet environments, while carbon steel tends to remain sharp for a longer period of time. The length of the blade and the length of the knife were relatively consistent across most products. This was to be expected because the best folding knife has a short closed length allowing it to slide easily into a pocket or purse where it can be retrieved quickly in case of emergency. However, non-folding knives can be just as useful. Just make sure that the knife has a decent sleeve or holster to safely carry the knife without damaging yourself or the blade.</p>"
mulching blades,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after options in their respective categories and discovered that the best mulching blades are determined by their size, weight, mounting type, compatibility with multiple mowers, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>Our top picks range from 21-inch to 54-inch blades with varying thicknesses to tackle small or large outdoor projects and work with multiple mulching lawn mowers available. While some have thin constructions that are meant for grass clippings and leaves, others are made thick to withstand collisions with stumps or rocks and have powder-coated steel finishes for long lifespans. This also coincides with the weight of each mulching blade as some are lightweight for small jobs or mowers while the heavier options are suitable for mowers that come with ample torque.</p> <p>From universal, bow-tie, five-star, and six-star mounting holes, many of the above picks have serrated teeth and high lift for leaves or dry to wet grass clippings, making them compatible with baggers. Finally, select picks come with multiple blades included to keep your grass and lawn in good shape for years to come.</p>"
woodworking tools,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I am an engineer, a DIY enthusiast, and for 11 years ran a woodworking shop. I have a thorough understanding of how these tools work and hands-on experience using them.

Nevertheless, many of the criteria remain the same.</p> <p>First, we looked at top performers. While specifications can be impressive, we were also careful to consider cost. Some of the best woodworking tools are simply too expensive for most home users. They might also be too large for all but commercial workshops.</p> <p>Brand reputation also has a major impact. Names like Bosch, DeWalt, Makita, and SKIL have long been recognized for build quality, and each makes an appearance in our list. However, we were also careful to look at sub-premium brands (though most are still household names). In doing so, we believe we have offered the widest possible choice, with tools for woodworkers at different stages of learning and with different budgets.</p>"
concrete cleaner,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after concrete cleaners in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by the type of stains they can resolve, cleaner type, compatibility with multiple surfaces, form, working time, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>To satisfy a range of preferences, we included liquid and dry options that have pH neutral, alkaline, peroxide, microbe, sodium hypochlorite, and water-based formulas to tackle a variety of stains and surfaces. Though each cleaner is formulated for specific stains, many of these concrete cleaners work on oil, dirt, mold, mildew, grime, moss, algae, and grease stains immediately or within a few weeks.</p> <p>While these cleaners are more than capable of cleaning concrete, many are also capable of being used on stone, wood, composite, metals, brick, fabric, and many more. For added convenience, some of these cleaners do not need to be scrubbed to work effectively, while others may require a pressure washer, sponge, or mop. Finally, some of these top products are recognized by the USDA and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice Program certified.</p>"
quiet fan,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The quietest fans can help to create white noise while you sleep, or run all day in your home office while you work. Selecting the best quiet fans depended upon their noise levels, design, adjustability, power, and portability.</p> <p>Each of the fans above runs under 60 decibels which is about the noise level of a regular conversation.

We only included products that offered great value and were durable enough to last for years.</li></ul>"
smart thermostat,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after smart thermostats in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their connectivity, size, voice control capability, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The above models can connect to Google Home, Amazon Alexa, SmartThings, Apple HomeKit, and Wink to be compatible with your home’s current smart home system.

work boots for men,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The right work boots can make your outdoor chores at home, work on the construction site, or hunting activities a more comfortable experience. Selections for the best work boots for men depended upon durability and materials used, size options, safety features, and comfort level.</p> <p>Each of the above products is made with a durable construction of full-grain leather, polyurethane-coated leather, rubber, and textile. With these materials also comes added safety, making them puncture-proof, waterproof, slip-resistant, heat-resistant, and electrical hazard protected. Some of these picks are also made to resist compression, leaving room for your favorite winter socks.</p> <p>For added versatility, many of these boots also come in ample size options and even include wide sizes. Though it is not the most important factor when it comes to work boots, these picks also take comfort into account with layered and cushioned insoles, uppers for ankle support, breathability, odor and moisture control, and even insulation for warmth in the colder months. But, some of these products may require pairing with work jeans or thick socks for added comfort, warmth, and safety.</p>"
reclining sofa,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Selecting a reclining sofa or loveseat that matches a space, provides ample comfort, and includes versatile features that satisfy personal preference can be hard with so many sofa brands to choose from. Selections for the best recliner sofas depended upon type, materials/upholstery options, size, special features included, and ease of assembly.</p> <p>The above list prioritizes variety with ample powered and manual recliners offered to suit many preferences. Most of the above picks are made with soft fabrics like polyester or microfiber for their stain-resistance and numerous colorways, while some others have genuine or faux leather for durability and comfort. To accommodate small or large homes and spaces, there are also varying sizes of sofas offered to seamlessly fit into a space.</p> <p>For versatility and convenience, USB ports, storage compartments, cup holders, footrests, headrests, and even throw pillows are included in many of the above picks. As for ease of assembly, most options come with little to no assembly required. But, some of these designs are large and heavy, which makes it difficult to move them into a home.</p>"
grow bag,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>For grow bags to do their job, they must come in a material that lets in air and lets out some moisture so water doesn’t pool at the roots. Of course, with these features, grow bags can be a little floppy, so we looked at bags that should be sturdy enough to support the weight of soil and plant. Portability can come into play for those who might need to move a plant in a grow bag. Most of the choices in this list include reinforced handles.</p> <p>Size matters, and it really depends on plant preferences and space available. We noted whether a bag is too small for growing large vegetables, but big enough for transplants or annual herbs. As a bonus, some bags, like these 7-gallon bags from Nicheo, have a window. Although not a necessity, this is a great feature when growing root crops like potatoes and carrots so growers can see if they’re ready to harvest. It also can help keep kids interested in gardening; they can peek at what goes on beneath the soil.</p>"
dust collector,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>There are many different features to consider when selecting the best dust collectors, but the main factors that were explored during extensive product research include the dust collector type, the product suitability, horsepower, air suction power, filter efficiency, and functionality. The dust collector type was important to incorporate because not every type of dust collector is suited to every user.</p> <p>The product type is also affected by the suitability and functionality of the product. For instance, not all listed products are dust collectors, but every product on the list can be used to make dust collection easier, such as the Rousseau 5000 Dust Solution. It’s almost useless on its own, but when paired with a shop vac or dust collector, it makes it much easier to keep the work area of a miter saw clean, despite the typical spray of sawdust.</p> <p>Horsepower, air suction power, and filter efficiency were top considerations while researching these products because these specifications greatly affect the dust collection ability of the dust collector and provide measurable information to help make comparisons between products.</p>"
dyson vacuum,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Dyson has a great reputation as one of the leading vacuum manufacturers, and many of the brand’s vacuums come with a premium price tag to match—which means it’s important to consider each option critically. However, it’s hard to go too wrong with a Dyson vacuum, but some models are better suited to some users than others. To cater to different households, we chose from a range of vacuum types and considered each model’s stand-out features to find the best options from each category.</p> <p>To narrow down the top products, we considered ease of use, maneuverability, suction power, additional features, and battery life. We considered how the vacuum’s features would improve cleaning performance and convenience for the intended user. For example, we chose a model that included HEPA filtration and pet hair cleaning accessories for homes with pets and a model with a gentle soft roller head for cleaning hard floors. These stand-out features helped us narrow down the best Dyson vacuums for a range of users so you can find the most suitable choice for your home.</p>"
ash vacuum,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best ash vacuum cleaners are the perfect fireplace tools to prevent excess soot, dust, and burnt materials from cluttering up your flue, hearth, and its surrounding area. Selections for the best ash vacuums depended upon motor power, cord and hose length, portability, tank size, and versatility.</p> <p>Each of the above picks has ample suction power for excess ash and dust with 4 to 10-amp motors. There is also an impressive range of cord and hose lengths to maneuver small or large fireplaces or spaces, most having at least 30 to 50-inches of cleaning reach. For portability and maneuvering, many of the above picks are lightweight and compact. For those that do have large, heavyweight constructions, built-in wheels and handles are included.</p> <p>As for storage of the ash collected, the tank sizes of the above models range from 2-16 gallons for small or large cleaning needs. For added convenience, many of these models also double as handheld vacuums, or detachable blowers, while others have drainage ports and/or wet/dry capability to be used for sawdust, leaves, or dirt.</p>"
power recliners,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>While reviewing the best power recliners, the first factor that comes to mind is size. It’s also one of the more variable traits among the power recliners on the market. From seat widths for various hip sizes to chair widths that impact delivery, it’s a smart idea to do a lot of measuring before purchasing a power recliner.</p> <p>Price is another key factor we considered, as a power recliner can easily cost more than a large couch. Durability can drive up prices, so how much does longevity matter? A higher price tag doesn’t always reflect a more premium upholstery material (such as leather), but most leather options came with longer warranty and repair contracts through the manufacturer.</p> <p>We curated a durable group of power recliner chairs and tried to bring forward the best of what’s available today. Both typical overstuffed models as well as sleek modern designs are included in the list. There is a range of sizes included on this list, as recliners need to match the user, and one recliner definitely does not fit all.</p>"
table lamps,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Lamps have evolved through the years, becoming more multifunctional. The lamps in this review were curated from 60 table lamps from various popular online purchasing venues based on specific criteria. Since many lamps are purchased in twos, affordability is a high criterion in this review: None of the lamps in this review exceeded $200.</p> <p>Another important consideration is height. A bedroom lamp usually ranges between 24 and 27 inches, while living room lamps stand between 24 to 34 inches tall. However, lamps don’t always have to fall within a particular height range to be effective. The main goal when choosing any lamp is to maximize the light and minimize the glare from the bulb.</p> <p>Each lamp’s design was also considered. Lamps provide light, but since they’re part of the decor, they also can serve as statement pieces. Finally, functionality is important. Lamps in this review are easy to power on or off. Some use a standard button, pulley, or rotary switch to turn off or on, while others can be adjusted by changing their brightness level.</p>"
standby generator,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Trying to choose the best whole-house generator from the wide range of available products isn’t an easy task. It was necessary to conduct extensive research into over 30 different generators to put together this list of the top standby generators for your home. The key factors we considered during the selection process included wattage, fuel source, transfer switch, and physical dimensions.</p> <p>Low-wattage and high-wattage generators were chosen for this list because smaller homes don’t have the same power requirements as larger homes. Similarly, dual-fuel generators were preferred because it’s always better to have a generator that can run on more than one type of fuel in an emergency.</p> <p>Typically, standby generators either come with a transfer switch or need to have one installed to transfer power to the home. Generators with automatic transfer switches make this process easy instead of needing to rely on the user to switch the power manually. Additionally, any standby generators with special features, like wireless monitoring or a liquid-cooled cooling system, were considered superior to similar products that lacked these features.</p>"
robot mop,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A robotic mop is a true time-saver that can extend the frequency of deep cleanings by months. Although these devices are not capable of the same heavy-duty cleaning as a person with a mop, many are capable of picking up spills, messes, and pet hair.</p> <p>We researched the best robot mop options in their respective categories and discovered that best options have multiple cleaning modes, long runtimes, cover ample amounts of space, and come with special features for easy, hands-free cleaning. Wet mopping and dry vacuuming models or just wet mopping options are the most popular models available as many come with carpet-sensing technology that increases suction and water tanks for marble, tiled, or hardwood floors. Plus, they can cover 200 to 2,580 square feet.</p> <p>Long runtimes are also prioritized in this list as most of these robot mops can clean for 75 minutes to over 3 hours. As for special features, some models are compatible with Alexa and Google Home or have a remote control, have programmed cleaning schedules and spaces, and voice activation.</p>"
kitchen sinks,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after kitchen sinks in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their style, materials, mounting type, size, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While researching the best kitchen sink options, farmhouse or apron front-style models are among the most popular for their ergonomic design and durability. Though not as popular, the single and double basin sinks are also viable for their ample working space and they are easy to clean. Our top picks also vary between stainless steel and 16-gauge stainless steel, fireclay, granite quartz, and cast iron to accommodate your personal preference.</p> <p>Also featured is a selection of either top-mounted or undermount sinks with undermounts being more popular for their ease of installation. As for compatibility with your kitchen, most of the above picks have the perfect dimensions to fit into the average kitchen. Finally, in the interest of including the best options available, we selected picks that include additional cutting boards, soundproof capability, grids, drying racks, drain covers, and basket strainer sets.</p>"
small air fryer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best small air fryers make it a pleasant task to reheat leftovers, cook crispy frozen fries, or fry up chicken wings for game day. With their recent boom in popularity, it can be overwhelming to shop for an air fryer that lives up to its culinary promises. We conducted thorough product research to find our top picks, choosing them based on performance, functionality, and ease of use.</p> <p>When narrowing down our top choices, we looked for highly rated fryers from top brands. The air fryers on our list boast user-friendly designs (with effective crisper baskets and adjustable temperature settings) to get foods hot and crisp.</p> <p>In terms of functionality, we looked for fryers with adjustable temperature, timers, and safety features like overheat protection, auto shutoff, and cool-touch exteriors. Extra functions or presets were also features we prioritized, as air fryers should work as a versatile countertop appliance. Last, we checked that the air fryers were easy to clean (and choose many with dishwasher-safe parts) to make cleanup as easy as the cooking process.</p>"
hose reel,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>You’re meticulous about your lawn and garden, and all is in its place. That’s why you need a sturdy and reliable hose reel that can hold the length of your hose neatly and does not break down over time.</p> <p>Many of the above options are made with aluminum or steel construction with powder-coated finishes for a long-lasting, waterproof lifespan. While some of the options are best kept in the garage over the winter, each of our top picks is able to hold over 100 feet of hose length with the added benefit of hose leads and guides for no tangles or warping.</p> <p>Some of the above options are meant to be portable by including wheeled frames, while others have hand cranks or automatic retraction for easy cleanup after your yard work. For added features, some of the top picks also include storage racks and trays as well as spray nozzles for convenience.</p> <p>Note that not all of these models are safe for year-round use, and some may require additional mounting or assembly before use.</p>"
vacuum for stairs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best vacuum cleaners for stairs can reduce the amount of dust, allergens, and pet hair on wooden or carpeted staircases. Selections for the best vacuum for stairs depended upon type, adjustability, wattage, attachments included, filtration type, and other special features included.</p> <p>The above list includes stick, handheld, or combination vacuum types to satisfy your preferences or be compatible with your space.

Large dust bins and canisters are also included, with some options offering easy dust and dirt ejection buttons. Finally, many of the above top picks are cordless vacuums that are lightweight and battery-powered for ample portability.</p>"
tower fan,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after tower fans in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, airflow capabilities, functionality, size, ease of use, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best options available, the floor-standing tower fans were the most popular type among users for their ample airflow capabilities. While not as popular, the bladeless, desktop/portable, and smart fans are viable options for their ease of use, safety features, and airflow settings.</p> <p>To ensure our list included the best options on the market, we included fans with high cfm ratings of 720 to 1,271 and additional functions including oscillation, air purification, ionization, and heating capabilities. Many models are compact enough to fit on a desk, while others take up little space in corners or next to furniture.

weed killers for gravel,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Gravel is a common material for creating rustic walks and driveways, but it’s not impermeable, so weeds can blow in and sprout or spread inward from the sides of the area. It’s common to put a weed barrier, such as a plastic liner, between the soil and the gravel, but weeds can still get a foothold over time.</p> <p>Gravel walks look terrific when clean and weed-free, but even a few weeds can ruin their good appearance. We researched dozens of weed killer products to determine which were well suited for use in gravel beds or sanded areas. We considered brand reputation, with Roundup and Ortho products having earned a reputation for efficiency, but didn’t automatically eliminate products made by smaller companies if they performed well.</p> <p>Chemical herbicides are the most effective, but some users are willing to spray more often with a natural weed killer to avoid ingredients that can remain in the ground for up to a year. The products that made the final cut in our lineup are effective and user-friendly.</p>"
smoker,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>For the master griller or the beginner, the right smoker can make all the difference when cooking ribs, pork shoulder, or brisket.

Most of these options also come with built-in wheels, temperature gauges, and durable racks for cooking. For the charcoal and pellet models, many brands include removable ash pans or fireboxes for easy post-use cleanup, or convection fan systems for ventilation.</p> <p>Smoker grill combos are also included in the above list as they can smoke, grill, bake, roast, braise, and barbecue.

Several top picks are made without the use of perfumes, phthalates, chlorine bleach, and parabens making them safe for skin and septic systems. While most of the hypoallergenic detergents on our list are made with some chemicals, select options are 100 percent natural or made with biodegradable surfactants and enzymes.</p> <p>As for quantity, these detergents last between 32 to 150 loads and have been recognized by dermatologists, USDA Biobased, SkinSAFE, EPA Safer Choice, and pediatricians.

Plus, most of these french fry cutters are compact and lightweight enough to store in existing kitchen space.</p>"
electric fence charger,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The size of the area that needs to be properly electrified is a primary factor for choosing the best electric fence charger. To accommodate a range of needs, we included a number of products that can cover 2 to 50 miles, which helps livestock owners and pet owners alike. The amount of power or joules that the electric fence charger puts out is also important, since a low-power unit won’t affect a horse or a bear. Our list has several units that have low output and several with powerful output to keep any wandering creatures in or out as needed.</p> <p>We narrowed our research to also include standard electrical chargers and some solar chargers. In regions with plenty of sun, solar electric fence chargers are cost-effective, and they include a battery to operate for several cloudy days. It’s also a helpful method for remote areas without electricity. Finally, we chose several units that work with any type of electric fencing and some that work best with steel as opposed to poly wires.</p>"
outdoor wood sealers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Wood sealers are designed to provide a waterproof exterior layer in order to protect the wooden structure, furniture, or object to which the sealer is applied. For the purpose of putting together this list of the best outdoor wood sealers, it was necessary to conduct in-depth research into a wide range of more than 40 products.</p> <p>The type and transparency were primary factors in the final decision because they affected the application, drying time, and resistances. Water isn’t the only hazard for exterior wood objects and structures. Opaque or semitransparent sealers provide UV protection and help to prevent the wood from drying and cracking.</p> <p>Water-based sealers are easier to apply and clean up, though they don’t cover as well as oil-based sealers, so you may need more than one coat. Additionally, low-VOC or zero-VOC products were preferred over high-VOC sealers that could have a serious impact on the environment. Color selection, price, and quantity were also taken into consideration to choose the best outdoor wood sealers for exterior furniture and wooden structures.</p>"

Be advised, however, that some of these mixes are not suitable for use on certain grass types and contain chemicals that may not be safe for pets and children.</p> <p>Additionally, some of these top picks can kill all vegetation they come in contact with, so careful application is recommended.</p>"
plant subscription boxes,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home and gardening products as well as extensive product research and testing went into creating this guide.

large air fryer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after large air fryers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their capacity, wattage, presets and cooking settings, temperature range, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The above picks were selected based on their ample capacities ranging from 0.6 to 20 quarts in capacity with 1,500 to 1,800-watts of power.

Mini fridges fall into four categories that each have distinctive sizes, capacities, and styles, so it was necessary to inspect and find top options that could represent each type of mini fridge.</p> <p>The size and capacity of a product related directly to the installation of the mini fridge but also to the items that could be kept cool inside the mini fridge. The limitations of some models, like bulky exteriors or disorganized interiors, dropped their overall appeal to the average person, while some interesting style choices, like bright, vibrant colors or retro handle designs, helped other mini fridges stand out from the crowd. Our final consideration was the quality of the products; there is no point in having a fridge if it fails to keep the contents cool.</p>"
bidet,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We combed through dozens of the top products available to compile our list of the best bidets.

We prefer brands that have decades of experience making bidets in a North American market.</li><li>Design execution and bidet features: We understand that some households only require a simple bidet, while others want all the bells and whistles. For simple bidet seats and attachments, we selected products that do simple design well and without cutting corners.</li></ul>"
reading chair,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A good book can draw you into a new world for hours—but reading in the wrong chair can leave you feeling uncomfortable and sore when you come back to reality.

outdoor bar stools,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>There are several features to consider when choosing an outdoor bar stool, and with so many options available, picking the right one can feel overwhelming. Like any other furniture piece, shoppers want a stylish option, so we kept aesthetics in mind when choosing the best outdoor bar stools.

A good bar stool should last several years, so we made sure our top picks were durable. Through extensive product research, we chose outdoor bar stools made of sturdy materials, made to withstand water and sun exposure, season after season.</p> <p>Lastly, what good is a bar stool if it’s uncomfortable to sit in?

grill tongs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To ensure that this list of grill tongs included a balanced selection of top products, it was necessary to have a foundation of grilling experience. Additionally, we undertook extensive product research to determine the key product factors that impacted the convenience and practicality of each product.</p> <p>We considered the length, material, style or type, and any unique features that made a product stand out from similar options.

gaming desk,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The main concern when it comes to choosing top gaming desks is finding products that are functional and effective. A desk needs to have enough surface area for a gamer to connect multiple accessories or peripheral devices that are essential for gaming. It also needs to be able to support the weight of the computer, monitors, and any other equipment that will be sitting on the desk. As long as a product fulfilled these requirements, it was considered for selection.</p> <p>Extensive research into over 40 gaming desks provided additional information, like height-adjustment settings, cable management, construction material, and any add-ons that could help a product stand out from similar options, such as a built-in mouse pad, cupholder, or headphone hook. The dimensions and shape of each product were also considered because it was necessary to note if a desk was too small, too large, or shaped in such a way that made it difficult to set up in the average home office or gaming room.</p>"
peel and stick floor tile,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In selecting the best products for this lineup, we looked at dozens of peel and stick flooring options to determine which products were likely to offer the best results. We looked at individual tile thickness—in general—vinyl tiles should be around 0.2 to 0.5 mm thick to ensure they wear well and form a durable flooring surface.</p> <p>We also looked at pattern and design, and we opted for tiles that would complement a wide range of interior design styles. We avoided fad-type tiles that came with loud colors or non-traditional patterns because they can be dated nearly as quickly as installed. Instead, we opted for tiles that would stand the test of time and serve as a visual backdrop for all types of furniture.</p> <p>We also looked at customer satisfaction—good quality tiles equal happy customers. While everyone has their own design style, and no two homes are identical, most DIYers agree that they want good products at reasonable prices. Our lineup has something for everyone.</p>"

Power is also not a problem with these models as many come with ample volts, amps, or horsepower while in use. ½-inch and ⅝-inch chucks are among the most common sizes in the best drill presses, while some models also come with adjustable/tiltable worktables, dust ports, variable speed control, and multiple speed settings included.</p>"
chainsaws,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Whether it’s for property maintenance or cutting small logs for a backyard campfire, owning a chainsaw for you can hasten the job.

Whether you prefer to keep a small mosquito barrier around your patio or spray an entire acre of land, there’s an option included to get the job done.</p> <p>We concentrated the coverage of hose sprays and aerosol canisters because their accessibility, light weight, and extreme ease of use suit most household needs. That said, we did select our favorite refillable machines for larger applications, focusing on options supported by backpack designs to increase mobility (and coverage) as well as decrease strain on the body.</p> <p>Just as important, we favor a few products that target mosquitoes and other flying insects but without negative consequences for the ecosystem. Two non-toxic options with plant-based active ingredients will not harm the environment—especially ideal for homeowners who have children and pets in the yard frequently.</p>"
table saws for beginners,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In selecting the best entry-level table saw options for this lineup, we determined essential needs for those just learning to use this power tool. While beginner tools in other categories are often less powerful—or a lot less expensive—that rule of thumb does not hold true when it comes to table saws. Injuries from table saws, typically finger or hand amputations, are more common than injuries from other power tools, so this is not the tool to skimp on quality and safety features.</p> <p>With that in mind, we exhaustively researched dozens of today’s top table saw models to choose units that are easy to use, safe, sturdy, and accurate. We looked at models from well-known manufacturers that have earned a reputation for quality. Still, we didn’t automatically exclude models from smaller or niche manufacturers if they feature quality materials and have a stellar reputation.</p> <p>Table saws aren’t cheap tools, but a good one should last for years and provide a high level of safety.</p>"
tactical flashlights,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Tactical flashlights should provide the user with a reliable light source in challenging conditions such as emergencies and outdoor adventure. To choose the best tactical flashlights of 2022, we compared the features of more than 40 tac lights for the most durable materials, the best battery life, and the brightest output.</p> <p>For our best tactical flashlight review, the factors we focused on were adaptability, weight, and brightness, and we also looked at beam distance and light modes because these tend to be features that will come in handy when you’re looking for a good tac light. We also considered price as tactical flashlights for emergency kits as well as other day-to-day use can get expensive.</p> <p>Tactical flashlights are often used for self-defense as well as recreation, so the best military flashlight might also be excellent for outdoor sports. Battery life can vary a great deal between models, so we spent some time looking for models that had good scores in that regard, too.</p>"
soap scum remover,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after soap scum removers in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their ingredients, compatibility with multiple surfaces, form, certifications, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best soap scum removers available, we included concentrates, sprays, and cleaning pads that are capable of removing mold and mildew, calcium, calcium carbonate, iron, rust, stains, scum, limestone, magnesium, and even grout stains.

toilet paper for septic,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Toilet paper is a surprisingly varied product that, when comparing brands, will feel almost completely different from one roll to another. Our research looked at the best options in the market for toilet paper specifically designed to dissolve more quickly than the ultra-thick, almost towel-like options that some shoppers gravitate towards. For delicate septic systems that don’t fare well with clogs or blockages from 3- or 4- ply rolls, shoppers need to consider sacrificing some softness and thickness for a product that will dissolve quickly and avoid clogging.</p> <p>Our list of recommendations gathers the top products in this category, offering a range of choices that are suitable for RVs, boats, camping, and other delicate septic systems. We made sure to include both 1- and 2- ply options, depending on how much users are willing to sacrifice comfort for dissolvability.

As such, our research has gathered several of the best products in their categories, providing a list of handheld and fixed options, as well as 2-in-1 combo units.

wallets for men,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Most people grab their wallets every time they leave home, so it doesn’t hurt to have a nice one. A wallet can be as much of an accessory as a useful way to carry money and cards, so we kept both style and function in mind.</p> <p>When choosing the best wallets for men, we considered the wallets’ material, design, safety, and convenience features. Through extensive product research, we looked for wallets that keep cards and cash safe, are pleasant to carry around, and look nice.</p> <p>We looked for durable materials with leather being a popular pick because it ages beautifully.

dewalt impact drivers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When making our selections, we took into account the fact that DeWalt’s line of impact drivers is designed to suit the needs of both DIYers and professionals. Most DIYers and pros tend to choose the most powerful tool when purchasing an impact driver. While an impact driver that offers the most torque certainly makes it usable in a broader range of applications, these top-end tools come with a steep price tag. Shelling out a lot of money for an impact driver that has more power than one will ever use makes no sense.</p> <p>With that in mind, we tailored our list of the top DeWalt drivers to suit DIY projects as well as pro projects. With DIYers in mind, we included DeWalt impact drivers that offered enough torque for home projects without breaking the bank. We also included professional tools that provide the high torque needed for commercial applications as well as features that appeal to professionals, such as Tool Connect.</p>"

cabinet hardware,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Style is one of the most important features shoppers look for in new cabinet hardware, so we put a lot of weight on aesthetics, choosing hardware that looks attractive and approachable to fit a wide range of homes and applications.</p> <p>Beyond looking nice, cabinet hardware should feel pleasant to use (you will use it every day, after all). Through product research and reading online reviews, we chose hardware that would feel comfortable in hand—no overly sharp corners or unfinished edges on this list.</p> <p>Switching up cabinet hardware is often taken on as a DIY project, so ease of installation was another important feature we considered. Each option on this list includes mounting hardware for easier installation, taking the hassle out of finding the right screws. We also looked for options where each piece is individually packaged. Although this uses a little more packaging, it greatly reduces scratches and dings in transit to make sure the hardware arrives ready to install.</p>"
lunchboxes for construction workers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Beyond the considerations above, a few additional aspects affected our picks.</p> <h3>Variety</h3> <p>A construction worker’s lunch isn’t always a simple sandwich or flask of soup. There’s nothing wrong with those things, but many people have more varied tastes or more complex dietary requirements. What we tried to do was find solutions for all needs, hence the wide range of lunch boxes for construction workers featured.</p> <h3>Practicality</h3> <p>Construction sites are rugged and sometimes dangerous places, so any lunch box that’s used on-site must be tough. We also considered the durability of each model that made the list and even sought out one that’s robust enough to function as a seat.</p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>While we wanted to offer a range of prices, we eschewed cheap lunch boxes for construction workers that wouldn’t live up to the demands of the job. Low cost isn’t good value if the lunch box falls apart after a couple of weeks. Sometimes it’s worth investing a little more.</p>"
massage chairs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We considered more than 35 massage chairs for our top picks. With so many choices at different price points, choosing a massage chair can be a stressful experience.</p> <p>To suit different shoppers, we considered massage chairs at different price points, evaluating each chair on massage coverage, types, programs, and setting variability. Through extensive product research and focusing on the best massage chair brands, we chose chairs that live up to their relaxation promises: vibrating, kneading, and rolling away muscle tension.</p> <p>Comfort can be nonnegotiable, so it’s one of the first features we evaluated. A cozy chair is the bare minimum, so we also looked for chairs with extra features like heating, reclining, and full body massage features.

brush killer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Brush, poison ivy, weeds, stumps, and other harmful plants can damage the integrity and aesthetic of your outdoor space and plants. The right brush killer can remove all noxious plants with the aid of potent ingredients, long working times, and water resistance.</p> <p>Many of the above picks are made with triclopyr, glyphosate, 2,4-D, or mixes of these chemicals for effective weed killing.

zero turn mower,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>For the purpose of selecting the top zero turn mowers, it was necessary to conduct extensive research into each product to determine the positive and negative aspects, along with any outstanding features that a mower may have. Due to the complexity of these machines, there were several important factors to consider when deciding on the best zero turn mower in each category, including the size of the cutting deck, mower speed, weight, fuel capacity, runtime, and power source.</p> <p>With so many product specifications to consider, it was essential to have separate categories for top performers in both the gas-powered and electric groups. Similarly, the weight, fuel capacity, and runtime helped separate products that were best for small yards from those that were more suitable for larger yards. Some thought was also given to extra features, like built-in headlights and cup holders, though these only improved the standing of a product if the primary features were similar to competitors.</p>"
lawn mowers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>All of the mowers included in our list exceeded quality standards established in our shopping criteria and proved worthy through testing. We selected each of the above mowers based on our previously mentioned shopping considerations. After sourcing the mowers and assembling the mowers according to the manufacturer’s instructions, we tested them in an average yard in order to gauge capabilities in several key areas. The most critical aspects we observed included general quality and durability, mowing power and cut quality, and operator comfort and convenience.</p> <p>We also tested each according to its claimed abilities. Riding mowers were used for larger and sometimes rougher areas and were assessed for power, speed, and comfort. Walk-behind and push mowers were mostly restricted to testing on well-established and well-maintained lawn spaces and closely monitored for cut quality and user convenience. We actually pre-mowed the grass ahead of testing the robot mower since it is intended to maintain rather than reduce grass height.</p>"

outdoor light bulbs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When selecting the light bulbs for this guide, we considered the most important factors: brightness, energy efficiency, and durability. For an outdoor light bulb to be effective, it must be bright enough to provide adequate illumination for the driveway, patio, front porch, or whatever is tasked with lighting. With this in mind, we stuck with bulbs that produced at least 700 lumens for entryway lights and at least 1,200 lumens for floodlights. The one exception was our entry for decorative lighting.</p> <p>Since energy efficiency is paramount these days, we eschewed incandescent bulbs entirely, instead sticking mainly to highly efficient LED bulbs. LED bulbs also last much longer compared to incandescent bulbs—about 50,000 hours versus 1,200 hours. Although LED bulbs are significantly more expensive, they make up for that cost difference with a lower electric bill (they’re about 90 percent more efficient than incandescent bulbs) and longer lifespan, often lasting many years longer than an incandescent bulb.</p>"

maytag washing machines,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A new washing machine is a major—and often pricey—purchase, so finding an effective, reliable, and long-lasting appliance is important. Maytag has an excellent reputation when it comes to washers, but not every machine is perfect for every home.</p> <p>We compared more than 20 Maytag washers and researched product specifications, published ratings, and consumer reviews to narrow down our top picks. Since different homes have different laundry wants and needs, we included a variety of washing machine types, including large-capacity models, compact machines, and smart washers.</p> <p>Washers with several useful wash cycles earned more points, although more affordable and basic models also had a place on our list.

rv sewer hoses,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used several criteria when making our choices for our list of the top RV waste hoses. Ease of use and versatility were key.

To make our list, the kit’s fittings needed to be easy to attach and detach without the need for special tools. They also needed to have translucent elbow adapters that would allow the user to easily monitor the flow of wastewater. Since sewer hoses tend to take a beating, we also chose thicker hoses made from durable materials. Portability is also crucial, so we only chose hoses that would condense to a small enough size to be easily stored.</p>"

utility sinks,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In determining what utility sinks to include in our list of the top models, we considered what makes a utility sink useful. A utility sink is supposed to handle duties that the kitchen sink can’t, such as washing large objects (or even a pet) and filling tall buckets. With that in mind, we chose models with large capacities and deeper basins that would allow the user to fit larger items or animals in them.</p> <p>A utility sink should also withstand cleaning paintbrushes or washing tools, so we chose stainless steel and plastic models that are designed to resist chipping or cracking.</p> <p>Some people see their laundry rooms and garages as pure utility areas, while others decorate them as they would any other room in the house. Keeping that in mind, we chose a mix of more expensive sinks that add style to a laundry room and affordable models that prioritize function over style.</p>"

I am also an engineer by profession, so I have a good understanding of the structure and function of chainsaw mills. When selecting our top picks, I used the following criteria:</p> <ul><li>Build quality: Chainsaw mills aren’t likely to be treated with a great deal of care, so a primary concern is how well they’re assembled. Each of the models chosen has the strength and durability to withstand a tough working environment.</li><li>Brand: Many of our choices come from brands that have long experience in the field and a recognized reputation. However, these units can come at a premium price, so I’ve also considered well-made tools from lesser-known manufacturers.</li><li>Value: Most chainsaw mills are very affordable, particularly when weighing the potential savings over store-bought lumber. Nevertheless, we were careful to pick models with a range of prices to offer something for every budget.</li></ul>"
electric scissors,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As with most power tools that replace hand tools, the point of a pair of electric scissors is to make cutting easier and faster. In the case of electric scissors, they’re also often a solution for those who may struggle with manual scissors due to arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome. With those factors in mind, we researched and analyzed a list of more than 25 electric scissors, considering weight, ergonomics, ease of use, and cutting ability.</p> <p>We only chose models that would be easy for most users to comfortably handle. To make the cut, the scissors needed to be fairly lightweight and had to have ergonomic grips with easily accessible on-off switches. As for cutting ability, we chose mainly models that could cut through thin fabric and paper as well as thicker material, such as leather. While versatility was important, the blades also needed to be thin enough to make precise cuts.</p>"

Attachments like crevice tools, pet hair and spot cleaners, and dusting brushes are also included for hard-to-reach cleaning needs. Additionally, large dustbin capacities allow for less frequent emptying.</p>"

Since rugs are often seen as a budget-friendly way to upgrade home flooring, we also stuck to affordable options with a few premium picks thrown into the mix.</p> <p>Beyond their looks, two key functional features were important for dining room rugs to make the list: easy-to-clean materials and a low to medium pile. We stuck to stain-resistant materials with a reasonably low pile to make sure the rugs can hold up to high-traffic and mess-prone dining rooms. We also mainly stuck to patterned rugs which tend to be the best option for dining rooms as they are better at concealing messes so the rug will look nicer for longer.</p>"

They have powerful engines and feature a range of user-friendly features. In choosing the models in this lineup, we focused on featuring a variety of models from different Honda mower series. We chose only one push-type model since many folks appreciate the self-propulsion function on a mower. Still, professional landscapers may prefer the simplicity of a push-type model, believing that these basic workhorses are less likely to have functional frailties.</p> <p>We ended up with more models from the HRZ series since they offer more user-friendly options. Still, Honda employs the same care and reliable engine in all its models, so users should choose based on their individual needs.</p>"

These recommendations include feeders that easily accommodate these birds and many others their size or smaller. Our favorites include the most popular designs like platforms, hoppers, window feeders, tubes, and houses that can hold suet cakes. Some designs prevent excess spillage on the ground, while others allow it; this attracts other larger birds that don’t mind feeding on the ground. Each feeder has a water draining system to prevent moisture from spoiling the birdseed when it rains, which is helpful for preventing waste.</p> <p>We researched products that had squirrel-proof designs to prevent extreme competition for resources, and we looked for styles that had plenty of access for cardinals’ preferred safflower seeds. Additionally, we narrowed our choices to include different size capacities, materials, and feeding ports. We included bird feeders at several price points as well.</p>"
wasp traps,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In reviewing dozens of wasp traps for our list, we considered several important criteria, including ease of use, effectiveness, and even aesthetics. A wasp trap should not be difficult to set up or dispose of once full. With that in mind, we only chose traps that one could set up in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>For disposable traps, we chose models that the user could easily remove and place in the trash. All the reusable models we chose included traps that could be opened and emptied without having to directly come into contact with the victims.

soil for orchids,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In putting this guide together, we extensively researched dozens of orchid-specific growing mixes—from both well-known garden-product companies and smaller operations—to determine which products were best suited for these tropical plants.

car vacuum,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Given that we have several different types of car vacuums among our top picks, we used criteria that encompassed a variety of characteristics.</p> <ul><li>Performance: A shop vac has a bigger motor than even the best cordless handheld vacuum, but each suits different users. What is important is that each device has appropriate power for its size. Lack of suction is hugely frustrating, so models that underperform were not considered.</li><li>Ergonomics and versatility: While weight alone is seldom a problem, poor balance can make a car vacuum awkward to use. Although our main focus was on car vacuums, we considered those that can also be used for household tasks, such as sucking up minor spills or accomplishing heavy-duty cleaning.</li><li>Brand and value: The quality and reliability of cheap car vacuums can be inconsistent. We chose tried-and-tested models that have sold in large numbers, thus ensuring a proven track record.</li></ul>"
light bulbs for bathroom,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best light bulbs for a bathroom can provide enough illumination for users as they go about their business, casting a pleasant color temperature that is not too harsh, yellow, or blinding. Our list of recommendations features a wide range of styles, shapes, brightnesses, and color temperatures to suit multiple style choices. We made sure to provide options for shoppers looking for simple no-frills lighting with dimming capabilities for added convenience.

Plenty of LED options are available as well as CFL bulbs and an incandescent bulb option for users who still prefer the traditional lighting style.</p>"
water based polyurethane for floors,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after water-based polyurethanes for floors in their respective categories. We discovered that the best options are determined by their coverage, finishes, ease of application, curing time, and the other special features included with top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best water-based polyurethane for floors, the most popular products among users provided 62 to 600 square feet of coverage areas in matte, flat, ultra-flat, crystal clear, semi-gloss, and gloss finishes. Moreover, our top picks are easy to apply with a brush, roller, or staining pad.</p> <p>While most of these top products require multiple coats, each has a fast curing time of 2 to 24 hours (although one takes 7 days to fully cure) for a scratch-, abrasion-, and scuff-resistant finish, even in high-traffic areas. Plus, select picks are safe for indoor/outdoor use, contain UV blockers, are no-odor or low-VOC formulas, or are eco-friendly.</p>"
jump starter with air compressor,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As we researched the market of jump starters with air compressors, we gathered our top picks and showcased each recommendation based on their standout features for certain categories. Users looking for high power output have plenty of options available on our list, as well as those who have heavy-duty tires to maintain. We made sure to include options for a range of budgets too, with impressive upgrade picks for those looking to splash out on a power house unit, to more budget-friendly options for occasional users.</p> <p>All of our picks come from reputable brands and each model comes in a relatively lightweight and portable frame, usually with a carry handle. Utility was an important factor for us to consider, so we made sure that all of our recommendations include multiple outlets for charging devices, from USB ports to actual 12-volt outlets that power almost any device.</p>"
sewing machines for beginners,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Sewing is a rewarding hobby, but getting started can be overwhelming. The good news is, there are plenty of sewing machines suitable for novice sewists. When evaluating the best starter sewing machine options, we kept ease of use, price, and sewing functions in mind.</p> <p>Through extensive product research, we found sewing machines that are packed with user-friendly features, as well as backed up with excellent shopper reviews. Features like versatile stitching options, automatic threading, and simple-to-load bobbins were beginner-friendly features we looked for.</p> <p>Hobby novices usually don’t want to spend an arm and a leg on their craft, so we kept affordability in mind. In addition to affordability, shoppers want a sewing machine that is reliable enough to serve a range of uses, whether for hemming a sweater or for crafting new curtains. Lastly, to ensure reliability, we chose sewing machines from well-established and trusted brands.</p>"
dinnerware set,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Selecting the best dinnerware sets available depended upon the variety of dishes offered in each set, the materials used, the colorways offered, and the versatility of the designs. Most dinnerware sets listed above come with dinner plates, salad plates, bowls, and mugs to provide 4-6 plate settings. Select sets also come with utensils for added convenience.</p> <p>Many dinnerware sets offered are made with stoneware, melamine, glass, bone china, and plastic, all of which offer durability and stain-resistance for long lifespans. To match your current fixtures and cookware, many of these picks are offered in multiple colorways from neutral tones to colorful patterns.</p> <p>Though the melamine picks are not dishwasher or microwave-safe, almost all of the dinnerware sets above can be used in the oven, freezer, microwave, and dishwasher. Plus, some picks are made without the use of chemicals, BPAs, and lead for added peace of mind.</p>"
fertilizers for zoysia grass,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Lawn fertilizer products are straightforward, and most contain high nitrogen levels, which is the most critical nutrient for greening up a lawn and boosting growth. We looked extensively at dozens of lawn fertilizer products before selecting the ones in this lineup as being among the best for zoysia grass.</p> <p>In general, most lawn fertilizers will be good bets for applying to zoysia grass because zoysia has the same nutritional needs as other turfgrasses. We looked at nationally known companies with stellar reputations for making quality lawn and garden products, such as Miracle-Gro and Scotts. Still, we didn’t automatically eliminate fertilizers from smaller or niche manufacturers if they contained quality ingredients.</p> <p>Finally, we looked at how satisfied customers were with different lawn fertilizer products. In the final analysis, we considered products containing additional ingredients, although our focus was still on ensuring that the product had adequate nitrogen.</p>"
solar christmas lights,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>With a sea of options to choose from, it can be tough to narrow down the best solar Xmas lights to illuminate your home. We narrowed down this list from more than 30 options, making sure to include a diverse selection in our top picks. We considered the different types of Christmas lighting and their function. To suit a vast array of Christmas displays, we chose a range of lighting to match, paying mind to style, size, and colors.</p> <p>Through product research and consumer reviews, we chose reliable and beautiful solar-powered lights. We prioritized lights that are affordable, have good charging and runtimes, and are easy to install and use. For many, Christmas lights are the highlight of outdoor holiday decor, so aesthetics were also a priority in our selections. We chose a range of festive and fun designs and colors to create beautiful holiday lighting.</p>"
vacuum for tile floors,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>What makes a vacuum great? In the end, the best vacuum is one that meets the needs of the user, and vacuuming a tile floor calls for some different qualities than vacuuming a deep-pile carpet. We started by examining basic features that all users could compare, including the suction and filtration of the vacuums along with the capacity of the dirt collection component. While cordless is more convenient, we found that in general corded vacuums are more powerful for longer—but a longer cord makes vacuuming an easier task than it would be with a shorter cord. We also took noise level and unique or individual features into consideration when choosing the best overall vacuum for tile floors. However, each user’s needs are different, so we evaluated multifunctional tools and special features so that each user can choose the tool that best handles their vacuuming chores.</p>"
christmas tree delivery services,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>If you’re using a Christmas tree delivery service for the first time, you may feel skeptical of the idea or overwhelmed by your options. The good news is there are several reputable companies that have been delivering high-quality Christmas trees for years or even decades. To fit any room or home, our top picks sell a variety of tree sizes and tree types, from tabletop plants to towering firs. One of the retailers on this list is likely to sell the tree of your dreams, whether it’s for a coffee table or a grand entryway.</p> <p>We chose our top picks from trusted companies and brands, including a variety of big-box retailers and local farms. With features like vetting processes, satisfaction guarantee policies, and easy-to-reach customer service, these brands ensure a beautiful tree will make it to your door, even if you didn’t choose it yourself.</p>"
artificial grass,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Extensive research into each product, including a thorough examination of the durability, style, color, texture, backing, and overall construction, was necessary to select the top artificial grass products. Durability was one of the most important factors because artificial turf is regularly subjected to human and animal foot traffic, which can quickly destroy substandard artificial grass.</p> <p>Additionally, the appearance and texture of the artificial grass were key components in the selection process because most users are looking for an artificial product that closely mimics natural grass. The material and style of the artificial grass were considered for both the appearance and durability of the product, while the pile height and product material also were necessary for determining foot traffic suitability. Artificial grass products that had built-in drainage holes or a multilayered backing to improve durability were typically considered superior to similar products that lacked these features.</p>"
oriole feeder,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Attracting orioles can be easy with the best oriole feeders, but enjoying songbirds comes with a little effort. We looked at capacity and types of food a feeder could hold to cut down on refill and cleaning time when possible. The material needs to hold up to oriole traffic and sun, rain, and wind, so coated metal and weather-resistant wood typically last longer. Plastic feeders cost less but vary in quality.</p> <p>The type of feeder can make a difference since bird lovers must refill either jelly, oranges, nectar, or mealworms (when orioles are feeding young). Several of these picks support more than one of these feed types. Sticky jelly, nectar, or orange juice drips lead to frequent cleaning, so ease of cleaning was a top consideration when evaluating oriole feeders. Most of these choices come in bright orange to attract these birds instead of wasps.</p>"
portable air purifiers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When researching air purifiers, we considered not only their features, but how those features interact within the design. We considered noise levels, filtration stages, size, and weight.</p> <ul><li>Noise levels: Not all manufacturers provide the decibel levels of air purifiers. However, for those that did, we looked for an optional low-decibel setting.</li><li>Filtration stages: The most common filtration stages are a mechanical HEPA filter and an activated carbon filter. We considered the effectiveness of each and how well they worked to remove particulates and odors.</li><li>Filter maintenance: We looked at the ease of replacing filters and how often they need replacing. We noted models with difficult-to-replace filters.</li><li>Size and weight: A portable air purifier needs a small footprint and low weight. We looked for models that stayed under 8 by 8 by 12 inches and 5 pounds. However, we made a few exceptions when the design was still portable.</li></ul>"
gas grill,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Our top picks included in this list of recommendations take careful consideration of the major aspects shoppers look for when buying a new grill. In terms of size and weight, these needs will vary widely from user to user, so we made sure to include a range of options, from very large cooking areas for big backyard barbecues like the Weber Genesis II 4-Burner Liquid Propane Grill down to portable options such as the Pit Boss Grills Stainless Steel Portable Grill, which is a great on-the-go cooking solution.</p> <p>Naturally, a vital component to a gas grill is temperature, how well it can be controlled, and how effectively it can maintain an even temperature throughout to avoid the dreaded hot spots that will burn any food that comes near it. As such, all of our recommended options stand out for their ability to maintain even heat.</p>"
firewood rack,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>This group of firewood rack recommendations aims to provide the full range of features shoppers most often look for in a firewood storage rack. With airflow being a vital aspect of storage to keep wood dry and seasoned, every product on our list provides a degree of airflow. In terms of capacity, we made sure to provide a wide range of sizes to meet most needs, from small indoor spaces all the way up to huge outdoor storage operations.</p> <p>In addition to function, due consideration was also given to aesthetics—since firewood racks can add a sense of style and charm to a home, our product picks span a range of styles, from modern geometric designs for minimalist spaces to the more traditional rustic look for timeless farmhouse decor.</p> <p>Lastly, all our recommended products are either very easy to put together or require no assembly whatsoever.</p>"
insecticide for vegetable gardens,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Healthy plants are resilient to minor insect infestations. Sometimes, though, outside influences lead to big bug problems, and gardeners may need a little help. When garden ecology gets out of balance, it may be necessary to spray powerful insecticides. The best insecticides may have either synthetic or organic formulas, are long-lasting and effective, and work on an array of noxious pests.</p> <p>The above list includes natural and chemical formulas that are made to target specific pest types or a variety of insects at once. Many are also odorless; leave no residue; and are safe for multiple plant, lawn, and houseplant types. Plus, some select options can be used indoors or outdoors.</p> <p>The above bug killers also avoid damaging beneficial insects while being safe to use around people, children, and animals. Be advised that some do not come with sprayers and require dilution before use.</p>"
sheds,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used several criteria when making our selections of the top sheds on the market, including build quality, aesthetics, and functionality. A shed must be able to hold up to extreme weather and be useful for many years, so we chose only models with durable construction. While wood-frame sheds are inherently strong, we only chose resin sheds with thick walls or steel reinforcement, while the metal sheds we selected were required to have thick-gauge steel construction.</p> <p>Functionality is important, so we favored sheds with large double doors and higher ceilings that provided additional storage as well as those with windows and skylights that provided natural light for visibility. Since sheds take up a noticeable spot on one’s property, we selected models that were attractive when possible, including those with interesting rooflines, appealing colors, and architectural features such as window boxes, cupolas, and eave overhangs.</p>"
concrete saw,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To determine the best concrete saws on the market, we looked at a variety of factors. First, we assessed how each saw cut, both in the types of materials it cut and in its power and accuracy. Specifically, we looked at how each saw and its blade cleanly cut concrete in different projects. Saws that struggled to cut concrete quickly and accurately were dismissed.</p> <p>A number of consumer-related factors were also assessed. The design of the saw was taken into consideration, as it was important to determine how easily customers could use the saw when cutting concrete. Safety features were evaluated as well to make sure users could easily access them and that they were easy to use. We also looked at the prices for the saws and determined which ones were priced fairly and gave the consumer the most value for their money.</p>"
gas can,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after gas cans in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their construction, included safety features, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While researching the best gas cans available, we found that plastic constructions were among the most popular for their compact, lightweight, and ergonomic designs. While less popular, the metal gas cans are a good alternative as they are more durable and include extensive safety features. Regardless of construction, the above picks range from 1 to 14 gallons in capacity depending upon your fuel needs.</p> <p>Most of the above picks also come with spouts included for easy refueling, with some coming with automatic shutoff or ventilating capabilities. Some of the best options we researched also included flame arresters, spill-proof designs, built-in wheels and handles, siphoning hand pumps, and integrated fuel gauges.</p>"
zero turn mowers for five acres,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Relying on the shopping considerations outlined earlier, we scoured the internet for medium to large zero-turn mowers built with homeowners in mind. We quickly homed in on the right-sized combination of a 60-inch three-blade deck and 24-hp engine. Finally, we settled on six industry-leading brands to choose from, each offering its own nuanced approach to designing and manufacturing zero-turn mowers. These brands also happen to be widely available through nationwide retailers and dealer networks.</p> <p>We included high-quality picks at a variety of price points without sacrificing reliability or durability. The value-priced models in our lineup offer excellent power and performance, but they may not deliver top end comfort or efficiency. Our higher-priced suggestions offer more in terms of comfort, speed, power, or styling. If you are serious about buying a new zero-turn mower, we believe that these recommendations will help narrow your search.</p>"
carpenter bee trap,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best carpenter bee traps are able to mimic an existing carpenter bee nest to attract the pests and prevent infestations from getting out of control. Our research found that natural wood options are highly effective while also being free of toxic chemicals, and they make an attractive ornament for an outdoor area. Our list of recommendations includes several wood options that stood out from their competition in terms of price, effectiveness, and longevity.</p> <p>Our top picks also make sure to prevent trapping less harmful creatures such as birds and other insects such as honey bees. Since carpenter bees can do serious damage to a homeowner’s wooden structures, the recommended products in this list are specifically designed to only attract carpenter bees. However, we also included an option that is capable of trapping other flying nuisances (like wasps) in addition to carpenter bees.</p>"
sander for furniture,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Our recommendations for the best sanders for furniture come from a number of well-known brands that have a great track record for power tools. We selected products that have a variety of dust collection methods, variable speed adjustments, and rotation or orbital movement. Some are better suited for fine sanding and polishing, while others are best for heavy-duty sanding to power through the toughest surfaces. These variations are important for users who know that no two sanding projects are the same.</p> <p>We further narrowed our research by products that have the standard round sanding surface that uses traditional hook-and-loop sanding pads and products with a pointed end that reaches farther into tight spaces. In short, there’s a sanding pad for everyone on this list (at a number of price points), which makes it a truly comprehensive collection of the best sanders for furniture.</p>"
pendant lights,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The right pendant fixture can add a touch of class to your space and provides a unique ambiance during dinner parties, late nights, or working days. Selections for the best pendant lighting depended upon ease of installation, adjustability, and number of bulb sockets.</p> <p>Each of the above lighting fixtures comes with easy to moderate installation with some picks requiring hardwiring. In these cases, professional help may be necessary during installation. Adjustability is also prioritized in these picks as many are compatible with sloped ceilings, dimmable, height adjustable, and some are also compatible with multiple types of light bulbs.</p> <p>Though some of these pendant lights come with only one bulb socket, others are made with up to 8 for ample light coverage. With that in mind, these light fixtures come with unique design styles and/or multiple colorways to match your home’s current fixtures.</p>"
above ground pool steps,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We reviewed 24 sets of pool steps to narrow the field to the top models on the market. To do so, we used a variety of criteria. Safety is the most important factor, so we only chose stairs with ample handrails, anti-slip treads, and barriers that prevent anyone from swimming behind them. When possible, we favored models with lockable gates that block access to the ladder when the pool is not in use.</p> <p>Durability and stability are also crucial shopping criteria, so we chose steps made from durable plastic resin that can withstand pool chemicals while maintaining a high weight capacity of around 300 pounds. A ladder should not move when someone is using it, so we chose models that would remain stable while in use, leaning toward those with brackets or flanges that allow them to be mounted to a deck.</p>"
weed killer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>These recommendations for the best weed killer include a variety of products to meet the weed-killing needs of typical users who want to maintain a residential landscape. We narrowed our research to focus primarily on liquid weed killers, as those are some of the most popular on the market due to their ease of use. However, we found that one granular weed killer ranked highest in the pre-emergent category.</p> <p>We also evaluated the weed killers based on how long each product stays in the ground and whether it has pre-emergent or post-emergent action, is selective or nonselective, and works on contact or systemically. While there are broad weed killers ranked on our list that can work quickly and have long-lasting effects, others are designed for killing either a targeted weed type or for targeted placement with little effect on the surrounding landscaping.</p>"
christmas decorations,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Home decor is a matter of personal taste, and your everyday decor will influence your Christmas decoration style. To suit a range of decor, we included a wide variety of Christmas decorations in different aesthetics. To dress up homes big and small, we chose items ranging from small trinkets to large inflatables. While each product might not work in every home, we prioritized style and chose products that were attractive or charming.</p> <p>Christmas decorations are only used for a few weeks a year, so we also kept price in mind. We chose affordable decorations from reputable brands to balance an accessible price point and good quality. Through product research and consumer reviews, we made sure to choose Christmas decoration products that are made to last for several seasons, so you can bring your favorite seasonal decor pieces out for years to come.</p>"
spin mops,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A high-quality spin mop can make cleaning messes and mopping floors more convenient. When selecting the best spin mops, user-friendliness was our top priority. Along with ease of use, we also looked at material durability, prioritizing spin mops made with high-quality plastic and rust resistant and durable stainless steel parts.</p> <p>Through extensive product research and considering shopper reviews, we chose spin mops that are intuitive and comfortable to dunk and wring using a sturdy hand-wringing mechanism or foot pedal—the less bending or fiddling with the mop, the better.</p> <p>Additional ease-of-use features scored a spin mop extra points. Some features we looked for included wheeled buckets, 180- or 360-degree mop-head maneuverability, and inclusion of a bucket drain hole, a splash guard, or a mop head agitator. We included several spin mops with these extra features to offer more bang for your buck.</p>"
christmas candle,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When it comes to Christmas candles, there’s a huge variety of candle types, sizes, and fragrances to choose from. When narrowing down the best holiday candles, we considered a few factors: the candle materials, scent, style, and burn time. We also considered the many reasons to choose a Christmas candle, including for their festive scent, for decoration, or for giving as a gift.</p> <p>Through extensive product research and by perusing online reviews, we selected a range of Christmas candle types, from flameless to wooden wick options. The wide variety means you can find a candle for nearly every use, whether for decorating or gift giving. We also made sure each candle had a standout feature like natural ingredients, a pleasing and appropriately seasonal smell, or a pretty decorative container to show why these candles are a great pick for your home.</p>"
saute pan,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>For avid cooks, a high-quality saute pan is a must-have kitchen essential. The best saute pans are ideal for browning, frying, and even baking. The ample capacity of 4-5 quarts means many of the featured picks also aid in cooking large cuts and group meals.</p> <p>The best saute pans are also compatible with multiple cooking surfaces, allow for the heat to be evenly distributed, provide nonstick cooking, and ensure clean-up is easy. The above selection is made from predominantly sturdy stainless steel and aluminum with many options including nonstick coatings.</p> <p>With these constructions, many of the above pans can be used in the oven or broiler and can go in the dishwasher. These picks also come with the advantage of stay-cool or riveted handles, tempered glass or shatter-resistant lids, side helper handles, and tapered edges for easy maneuvering during the cooking process.</p>"
undercounter ice makers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Since undercounter ice makers are built into your cabinets, put as much thought into choosing one as any other major appliance. When choosing the best undercounter ice makers, we researched products based on a few important criteria. We considered more than 25 built-in ice makers and narrowed down the top picks according to their performance, durability, ease of use, and price.</p> <p>We looked at production rates, storage capacities, and factors that contribute to ice quality, such as filters or proprietary technology. We prioritized ice makers constructed with durable materials, favoring stainless steel over plastic. Ice makers with additional ease-of-use features (self-cleaning settings, timers, and LCD controls) earned extra points.</p> <p>To accommodate the needs of a wide range of shoppers, we also chose several budget-friendly units. Lastly, since reputable kitchen appliance brands usually manufacture more reliable products, we stuck to recognizable brands.</p>"
rotary laser levels,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>I have been involved with several extensive house remodeling projects, so I have hands-on experience with laser levels and measuring devices. While I have never used a rotary version, I understand the technology and was interested to see the various ways in which it was implemented. Our team also conducted extensive product research to make sure we were aware of the latest developments.</p> <p>We looked at the various performance aspects mentioned above, and because these devices often are used in harsh environments, we also noted IP ratings and physical protection.</p> <p>Brand reputation and value for money always rank high. Johnson, Spectra Precision, Topcon, and Bosch are leaders in the field, with excellent reputations for precision and durability. However, big names often come with premium prices. We also considered less well-known manufacturers who offered equipment that met our quality and performance expectations.</p>"
rust remover,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We spent several days on research before arriving at the selections above. It was important to understand the variety of products available and how the different kinds of rust remover work.</p> <p>Where possible, we tried to select environmentally friendly products that are as safe to use as possible, though in some cases, we had to step outside those boundaries. What we have done is make a representative selection across the market and have included relevant information so buyers can use their own judgment.</p> <p>Value is another important consideration. While rust removers aren’t particularly expensive, overall cost depends on the area of rust that needs to be treated. Balanced against this has to be convenience. Aerosol rust converters are more expensive, but they are quick and easy to use. We also stuck with well-known brands that have a proven track record.</p>"
air purifier for pets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The right air purifier can cleanse the air pollution in your home of pet odors like dander and kitty litter. Each of the above picks was selected for its effectiveness, size, noise level, and user-friendliness.</p> <p>The above picks are effective at removing particles, toxins, and odor in rooms of 200 to over 1000 square feet with HEPA, activated carbon, or UV air purification. Many of these units also have multiple layers to their filtration to remove 99% of the noxious material from the air.</p> <p>These air filters also run quietly as they work with the loudest option being 40 decibels. Select filters also have a sleep mode that operates silently through the night. Additional special features included in these models are a child-lock feature, color-coded air quality monitor, auto-adjustment based on changes in the environment, and washable and reusable filters.</p>"
toilet paper,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Buying toilet paper that meets your needs can make a big difference when it comes to environmental impact as well as your home septic system. Selections for the best toilet paper on the market depended upon thickness, quantity, septic compatibility, and environmental impact.</p> <p>Many of these picks come in varying quantities to satisfy large or small households, from 6-packs to 36-packs. Thickness being the biggest aid of comfort while in use, the above options vary between 1 and 3-ply thickness for your personal preference. This also aids in the type of septic system you have to avoid clogging or damage.</p> <p>Some of these choices are also compatible with RVs, boats, and composting toilets for the safety of smaller septic systems. Plus, with recycled, bamboo, quick-dissolve, and other sustainable toilet paper options, the environmental impact of these picks is minimal.</p>"
vanity lighting,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best vanity lighting must be lit well to fit the mood of the bathroom, while hopefully looking great and adding a touch of style to the bathroom. We researched the top bathroom lighting brands and vanity designs with high customer satisfaction and positive testimonials.</p> <p>We gathered our top picks in a range of styles to match several popular bathroom looks—from glamorous modern with sleek chrome finishes to antique brass for a vintage aesthetic. Naturally, since we’re talking about bathroom lighting, the recommended products also feature a degree of moisture resistance and should comfortably stand up to the occasional splash.</p> <p>Shoppers differ in terms of their preferred color temperature and brightness for their bulbs, so we made sure to include options for a wide variety of bulb types, colors, and brightness levels—many of our top picks are also dimmable.</p>"
bamboo toilet paper,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The average person uses around three rolls of toilet paper per week. This habit creates a lot of waste, so what you wipe with matters. When choosing the best bamboo toilet paper, the primary considerations we looked for were eco-friendliness and user experience.</p> <p>Through extensive product research, we chose bamboo toilet paper products that make a good effort toward sustainability through better manufacturing processes (including less chemical use, closed-loop systems, and sustainable farming practices). A third-party certification, such as FSC certification, earned brands a place on our list.</p> <p>It’s hard to switch to a more sustainable toilet paper if it’s scratchy and thin, so we prioritized brands with excellent user reviews that mention comfort. Shoppers have a range of concerns, so we chose a variety of toilet paper types, from organic to septic-safe products, to cater to different consumers.</p>"
paint stripper,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A good paint stripper is one of the easiest ways to remove paint and varnish to prep an old piece of furniture or other material for refinishing or painting. When gathering our top picks for paint stripper, we paid attention to what types of coatings each product will remove as well as its compatibility with metal, wood, plastic, and other types of materials. Our list of recommendations features a wide range of products to suit a variety of requirements, from the ability to remove multiple paint layers to avoiding harsh chemical odors for sensitive indoor applications.</p> <p>We also made sure to consider the active ingredients used in the strippers we recommend. As such, we chose mostly green products that don’t use harsh chemicals such as methylene chloride or NMP, which are toxic to humans and harmful to the environment.</p>"
barn doors,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We considered a variety of criteria while examining more than 30 barn doors for this list. Durability was crucial, so we selected only those doors with solid wood or metal construction to ensure they could withstand daily use. We also understand that ability levels can vary regarding assembly and installation, so we chose doors that were ready to hang out of the box and unfinished models that can be tailored to meet specific designs.</p> <p>We also included a mix of different styles to suit preferences, ranging from the classic rustic barn door to modern models with metal frames, glass panes, and mirrors. Size is critical with barn doors, so we leaned toward models that offer multiple size options to suit entryways of varying sizes. For doors that require assembly, we stuck with models that require minimal tools and time.</p>"
deep fryer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Deep fryers take some getting used to, so one of the first considerations we made was the ease of use. We asked questions like, how easy is it to drain the oil? How long does it take to get the oil to temperature? Are there presets to help you find the right oil temperature?</p> <p>Our next consideration was if the fryer could heat the oil quickly and efficiently. A fryer should hold the temperature fairly well, even when users are putting the food into the oil.</p> <p>The final two considerations were oil capacity and cleaning ease. Some models cook only enough for two, while others make enough for a crowd. Deep fryers can be messy, so cleaning ease played a big role in which models made the list. Features like dishwasher-safe components and a removable basin got bonus points.</p>"
hori hori knives,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best hori hori knives are practical, durable, and comfortable to use.

We prioritized knives made from high-quality materials, including sturdy stainless steel with wood or bamboo handles. We did include a few knives with decent plastic handles; these were affordable picks. A hori hori knife earned more points for a full-tang blade, which will hold up better through tough gardening tasks.</p> <p>While material is important, it’s not the only factor that affects use. We also looked for balanced and ergonomic designs, so the knives feel comfortable in hand.</p>"

Many of these picks are suitable for laminate, but most can also be used on hardwood, tile, vinyl, ceramic, linoleum, stone, and other sealed hard floors.</p> <p>Though the majority of these picks do not have hands-free wringing mechanisms, select picks come with large mop heads, manual hand triggers, 180- to 360-degree mop heads, additional accessories or scrubbers, telescoping handles, and refillable bottles for ease of use.</p>"

gas grills under 300,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Since a grill must endure the weather, extreme temperatures, and greasy food, build quality is important when considering any gas grill. Despite their low price point, many of the grills under $300 use similar materials as higher-priced grills. We only chose grills with porcelain-coated iron or stainless steel construction. Since aesthetics are important when it comes to gas grills, models with stainless steel lids and bodies ranked higher than those with painted cast iron. We also limited our selections mainly to grills with cast-iron grates, which offer the best cooking performance.</p> <p>Since heat flux is part and parcel to a gas grill’s ability to cook food evenly, we chose mainly grills with heat flux ratings between 80 and 100. We also favored grills with additional features, such as electronic ignitions, side burners, grill tool storage, and integrated thermometers.</p>"
john deere lawn tractors,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In choosing the tractors for this lineup of John Deere-specific lawn tractors, we focused on what we felt were among the most common residential yard-care needs.

Then, we hunted down models best suited to specific needs such as the need to mow tight radiuses around multiple trees or to cut closely along the edge of a fence or structure.</p> <p>The result is a lineup with an array of John Deere lawn tractors within a range of power levels and price tags. Still, each of the chosen models is suitable for use with multiple John Deere attachments to extend each one’s versatility.</p>"

We also included a few automated vacuums that are capable of handling all surfaces, from floors, walls, and even stairs—which not many models are capable of.</p>"
tool belt,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The following criteria resulted from in-depth research and actual hands-on experience with tool belts during extensive remodeling projects.</p> <p>Comfort. It doesn’t matter whether a tool belt carries five tools or 50; if it isn’t reasonably comfortable, it won’t serve its purpose. That’s not to say all tool belts offer equal comfort, but they need to provide a level of comfort appropriate to their design.</p> <p>Capacity. Some people need a belt that will hold just four or five tools. Some might need to carry a dozen or more. To ensure we offered choice for all kinds of users, we included a wide range of capacities.</p> <p>Durability and value. DIYers and pros seldom look after their tool belts, so good construction and quality matter. At the same time, cost matters, too. Our broad selection offers quality pieces for all budgets.</p>"

Our list of recommendations offers a selection of products from the best brands on the market, which stand out for their quality, longevity and compatibility. We made sure that our top picks come with robust NSF testing and verification, and some of these filters boast several certifications and ratings to provide the highest water quality possible.</p> <p>In our research we noted that a vital consideration for shoppers is replacement frequency, so we made sure to include options for filters that last longer than the average 200 gallons—one of our picks can last for a whopping 500 gallons—to help reduce the number of times per year that the filter needs to be replaced.</p>"

Many of these picks are suitable for vinyl, but most can also be used on hardwood, tile, laminate, ceramic, linoleum, stone, and other sealed hard floors.</p> <p>Though the majority of these picks do not have hands-free wringing mechanisms, select picks come with manual hand triggers, 180- to 360-degree heads, additional accessories or scrubbers, telescoping handles, and refillable bottles for ease of use.</p>"

citrus fertilizer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Citrus fertilizers are formulated to address the specific needs of orange, grapefruit, and lemon trees, which differ from other types of trees. The tree’s age, how recently it was planted, and the soil’s natural nutrient content are all important to think about when selecting the best citrus fertilizer. We considered nutrient content, whether formulations were organic, and the form in which the fertilizer comes to compile this carefully curated list of the best citrus fertilizers. Form is a matter of convenience for some citrus tree growers, so we included different types.</p> <p>In addition, gardeners should be aware of the best time to fertilize citrus trees in their growing region, which might affect fertilizer choice. When used as directed, these fertilizers should give citrus lovers the result they desire—robust root development, healthy foliage, and ample fruit production.</p>"
cat repellents,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Years of experience covering home goods as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 cat deterrent options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Type: Many types of cat repellents, all of which have different uses, are available. To make this guide as comprehensive as possible, we included products designed for both indoor and outdoor use as well as products that purport to correct a variety of behaviors.</li><li>Reviews: Many cat deterrents make impressive claims but don’t actually hold up to user testing, so we included only well-reviewed products on this list, regardless of format.</li><li>Safety: When choosing a cat repellent, opt for a product that’s humane that won’t cause harm to pets or neighborhood animals. We chose only nontoxic and safe repellents in this guide.</li></ul>"

watering wand,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>The best watering wand is functional, sturdy, and can include a range of adjustable features to make it easier to water lawns and gardens. We looked at whether a wand has adjustable spray patterns and curved, adjustable, or pivoting heads so that it can meet multiple lawn and garden needs. We also looked at the wand’s materials; metal is the most durable material, but it’s heavier than plastic.</p> <p>Wand weight and shaft length matter for those who are prone to arm, hand, or wrist fatigue. Shorter wands typically weigh less and work best in small spaces where a longer 30-inch wand gets in the way. But a longer wand helps when gardeners have to reach under or behind plants. Handle design and the control lever also are important features for durability, ease of use, and ergonomics.</p>"

In any case, all of our picks are from reputable brands and are made with long-lasting materials.

The quality of the beginner sets is quite good and meets most expectations in terms of vibrancy, blending ability, and use on several mediums.

All of these soft pastels are dry chalk based rather than oil based, though some are a little harder than others.</p> <p>We further narrowed down our selection by the size of the sticks to include regular and small pieces that may work better for detailed art. Several top art brands were also included to ensure our list contains products with a track record of quality.</p>"
gutter sealant,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Many DIYers have at one time or another been up a ladder cleaning a blocked gutter or attempting to fix a leak. In assessing the best gutter sealants currently available, the following criteria were considered.</p> <p>Manufacturer information is helpful, but in order to assess real-world performance and durability we felt it important to review feedback from actual buyers. Products with significant application problems or failures did not make the cut. It is not always possible to select environmentally-friendly products so wherever quality water-based products were available, they were chosen over solvent-based products.</p> <p>Value isn’t just about the cost per amount of a product. Generally speaking, even small containers could provide enough product for a single repair. So we also considered if the gutter sealer could be used for other tasks, thus offering better value for money.</p>"
forstner bit set,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A lot of research goes into selecting products that’ll meet the needs of a variety of buyers.

I use Forstner bits for precision furniture-making as well as for punching holes through support beams in preparation for cabling. Some of the best Forstner bits cut like fine chisels, but sometimes speed is more desirable than great accuracy. Durability, edge retention, and price also play a part. In my opinion, the wide range of Forstner bit sets listed above provides a solution for (almost) every demand.</p>"
welding gloves,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used a variety of criteria to review more than 2 dozen pairs of welding gloves for this guide.

The gloves on our list consist of thick leather with insulation, such as aluminum foil, and heat-resistant Kevlar stitching. For the best MIG welding gloves and best stick welding gloves, we prioritized heat protection over flexibility.

anti fog safety glasses,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In making our selections for this list of top safety glasses, we considered a variety of important criteria.

Coverage is also vital to safety glasses’ effectiveness, so we chose those that offer side coverage as well as head-on projectile protection.</p> <p>Many jobs require wearing safety glasses for the entire workday, so we favored lightweight models with comfortable design attributes. This includes rubber-coated arms and nose pads, as well as features that allow the user to adjust fit.

christmas tree bag,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We dug into the different Christmas tree bag options, from size to type. Materials played a big role in our choices. Most people need a storage bag that resists both tearing and water, and that comes down to materials. The durability of the handles and seams also factored in when we considered materials. We also considered the quality of the closures. After all, a zipper that pops the first time it’s used won’t protect the tree much.</p> <p>When it comes to types, models that lay flat are more popular. Most of our picks come from this category. However, we included an upright bag and a Christmas tree box because of the many ways trees can be stored. All in all, we considered over 50 Christmas tree storage bags before selecting the models on the list.</p>"

These largely determine the force that can be applied to a particular task and differentiate DIY tools from pro models.</p> <p>I also have given consideration to the manufacturers’ reputations. Certain brands have long-standing reputations for reliability and durability. That said, I was careful not to overlook a bargain even if the maker is not one of the big names.</p>"

gas grills under 1000,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We considered several criteria when choosing our top grills under $1,000. Durability is vital when it comes to gas grills, and a grill that costs upwards of $1,000 should be able to endure the elements for many years. With that in mind, we primarily chose grills with thicker gauge steel construction both in the body as well as on the burners and interior heat distributors.</p> <p>A grill at this price point should also have additional features that make it easier to cook, including sear burners, side burners, and specialized cooking kits, such as a rotisserie or smoking box.

solar path lights,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Solar lights don’t come with many functions, but consumers want to know that they’re getting well-made lights that won’t rust or die after a rain shower. We tested each set of lights and noted their intensity, how long their batteries lasted, and whether they were made from durable materials.</p> <p>We awarded points for real glass and metal components, but we also included well-made plastic models because they’re more affordable and offer similar illumination. We noticed that the more lumens the light produced, typically the shorter they remained alight at night. The exception to this rule was the Aityvert torches that stayed on until the sun rose.</p> <p>The solar lights were also awarded points for providing something extra, such as creating exciting light patterns on the ground or featuring color-changing LED bulbs.</p>"
l shaped desks,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When researching L-shaped desks to find our top picks, we took the most common features into consideration.

These above options vary between 200 and 500 square feet of coverage, offering viable options for one or two-car garages.

electric range,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We considered several criteria to narrow the more than 20 electric ranges we reviewed down to the top models. Heating power is crucial for an electric range, so we chose models that can reach the higher heat levels needed to offer such features as power boil. Versatility is also important, so we leaned toward ranges with dual burners and fifth burners.</p> <p>Oven capacity determines a range’s ability to cook multiple dishes at once or large roasts and turkeys. With that in mind, we chose models with capacities of 5.3 cubic feet or more. Finally, we also chose models that offer premium cooking functions such as air-frying and convection baking and roasting. Finally, an electric oven should be easy to clean, so we stuck mainly with those that have self-cleaning functions.</p>"
soil for raised beds,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after soil for raised beds in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their ingredients, quantity, versatility, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best garden bed soil, we found that the most popular types among users were the ones made with organic materials including peat, coir, perlite, worm castings, compost, and more.

pocket hole jig,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In researching more than 20 different pocket hole jigs, we used a variety of criteria to narrow the field to these top picks. It should be relatively easy to make pocket hole joints with a pocket hole jig, so we favored pocket hole jigs with designs and instructions tailored to DIYers. Keeping ease of use in mind, we chose jigs that work with projects large and small by leaning toward those with two or more guide holes.</p> <p>Portability is key for many projects, so we included compact pocket jigs that are easy to carry in a tool box as well as larger benchtop models for home workshops. Finally, a good pocket jig should last a long time, so we chose durably constructed models that will hold up to repeated use.</p>"
work boots for electricians,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Putting together a list of the best electrician work boots was no small task. We had to draw on years of experience in the trades as well as our knowledge of work boots to come up with the features we felt were most important before we could even start looking at boots.</p> <p>Once we knew which features we were looking for, we performed extensive product research to compile a list of the best shoes for electricians that met our criteria. We then dove deeper on each pair, comparing features and prices to ensure we were suggesting nothing but the best quality and value. We tossed the boots that didn’t offer enough value to the side, and then awarded the remaining boots a spot on this list based on their strengths.</p>"

christmas garland,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Christmas garlands come in a range of styles and materials to suit different aesthetics and locations, and a garland that looks lovely in one home may not necessarily suit another. Because of the variety of both home and garland styles, we prioritized including a diverse collection of garland types and designs. We also considered the intended location and use of the garland, selecting garlands of different sizes and thicknesses, as well as including indoor/outdoor and pre-lit options.</p> <div><div>Advertisement</div><div data-desktop-tablet-content=""""></div></div> <p>Regardless of the garland type and aesthetic, through extensive product research we prioritized attractive, well-reviewed, and sturdy options, made to last beyond a few seasons.

range hoods,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>For those who love to cook, adding an efficient range hood is one of the best upgrades you can make to a kitchen. Kitchens come in all shapes and sizes, and so do range hoods.

Select options are also safe to use for drinking water.</p>"
drywall sanders,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>As an engineer, I have a good understanding of the technical aspects of these tools. As someone who has completed ground-up remodeling of two homes, I have practical experience with drywall sanding. I have also conducted considerable research into the range of tools currently available and the opinions of users and independent reviewers.</p> <p>We have been careful to cover methods of drywall sanding for all budgets. While powered models are undoubtedly more efficient on large jobs, we have included affordable manual versions that will make even relatively small tasks that much easier.</p> <p>Build quality was also a key feature, regardless of drywall sander type or cost. Drywall dust can play havoc with linkages, mechanisms, and motors, so it was important our picks could stand up to this difficult environment.</p>"
soap subscription boxes,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Through product research and perusing consumer reviews, we chose a variety of soap subscription boxes that deliver high-quality products.The selected subscription services all have characteristics that set them apart from products typically available at stores, such as handmade craftsmanship, unique scents, eco-friendly practices, or niche items for a specific audience.</p> <p>Across the board, we looked for subscription boxes that offer a satisfying user experience.

Sustainable practices were also a plus that earned some subscription boxes a spot on this list.</p>"
walk in tubs,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used several criteria when selecting models for our list of the best walk-in bathtubs. Considering that the most important feature of a walk-in tub is accessibility, we chose models designed for easier entering and exiting, including low door thresholds, wide doorways, and multiple grab bars. Sitting for many minutes while waiting for the tub to fill and empty can be tedious and uncomfortable, so we opted for models with fast-fill faucets and power drains. We also favored units with spa features such as whirlpool and air jets for massage. While cost was not a major factor, we looked for models with reasonable prices for the features provided and sought to include a range that includes affordable basic models as well as walk-in tubs loaded with high-end accoutrements.</p>"
bar sink faucets,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used a variety of criteria while reviewing dozens of bar faucets for our list. Size is crucial when it comes to finding the right bar faucet, so we chose models that provide ample clearance under the spout for cleaning various-size barware while maintaining a short enough reach to suit smaller sink sizes. Keeping functionality in mind, we made sure to include models with detachable sprayers that make it easier to rinse and fill glassware.</p> <p>Design is also important, so we selected a variety of different styles to suit different bar looks, favoring models with multiple finish options. In an effort to meet the needs of various budgets, we included high-end models from some of the most well-known faucet manufacturers as well as budget options from boutique-sized companies.</p>"
dual fuel ranges,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Given the many different configurations possible with dual fuel ranges, we set out to offer the widest possible choice. We applied the following criteria:</p> <ul><li>Burners and BTUs: We not only looked at the number of burners or the stove’s maximum power output but also the versatility that the range offers.</li><li>Ovens: Capacity is always important, but a 48-inch dual fuel range doesn’t always have much more interior space than a 30-inch model. We looked at functionality and cleaning as well as at overall capacity.</li><li>Features: Anything that makes the cook’s life easier is a valuable bonus, so we looked for user-friendly feature sets.</li><li>Brand and value: Some brands are known for their value-for-money, and cost is always an important factor. However, we also included premium brands that focus first on performance.</li></ul>"
steak knives,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Similar to a good kitchen knife, top-rated steak knives are sturdy, sharp, and comfortable to hold. We conducted thorough product research and considered shopper reviews to find the best steak knife sets for most homes. When evaluating steak knives, we considered performance first, looking for knives with a sharp blade, well-balanced design, and comfortable-to-hold handle. With a few exceptions, we prioritized knives with a straight-edge upswept blade, which glides through meat easily for nice, clean cuts.</p> <p>Since many steak knives are meant to look impressive, we also sought sturdy and handsome handle materials (choosing a range to suit different tastes) and an attractive design overall. To ensure quality, we chose knives from top brands, including those with a long legacy and good reputation, like Wüsthof, Victorinox, and Zwilling.</p>"
fertilizers for hydrangeas,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To keep hydrangeas growing and blooming bountifully, you need a fertilizer or soil amender that’s made specifically for these acid-loving plants. Our recommendations include a variety of options to help improve the health and beauty of these plants. We’ve selected traditional water- soluble fertilizers that help stimulate root growth, granular fertilizers with microbes and fish meal, and soil amenders that help increase the soil’s acidity to achieve blue flowers. As a bonus, we also included an all-in-one product that is an effective pesticide and fertilizer that also helps plants resist common diseases.</p> <p>We’ve included some low-cost options, too; however, they may require frequent application for effective fertilization all season. Our favorite options effectively increase the bloom rate of hydrangeas, and gardeners can choose between organic and non-organic products.</p>"
soil for pothos,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We extensively researched dozens of indoor potting mixes to select some of the best soil choices for pothos. To qualify for consideration, the potting mix had to contain the components necessary for pothos to thrive. Mixes, such as orchid and cactus mix, were excluded, because they drain too rapidly and don’t contain the ingredients required to retain moisture for pothos roots.</p> <p>Mixes that did not contain the ingredients necessary to keep the soil from becoming compressed over time also were excluded. We considered the manufacturer’s reputation—Miracle-Gro is widely recognized as producing high-quality products—but we also looked at lesser-known brands if they contained the right soil components. Our recommendations include a variety of soil options at different price points and quantities to meet the needs of most pothos gardeners.</p>"
fertilizers for cucumbers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To make the cut for this lineup, the fertilizer first had to provide an NPK analysis that was either balanced or had less nitrogen (N) than phosphorus (P) and potash (K). Any products with a higher nitrogen content were eliminated right away because cucumbers don’t produce well in soil with high nitrogen levels, tending to make all leaves but few, if any, blossoms.</p> <p>We also looked at brand reputation. It’s hard to beat brands like Miracle-Gro based on reliability and quality. However, we didn’t eliminate fertilizer products if they met our guidelines but were manufactured by smaller (or niche) companies. In addition, the fertilizer product had to be well-liked by other consumers who used them and found them beneficial. Plus, the fertilizer had to be simple to use.</p>"

Searching for sturdy stands to support varying sizes and types of Christmas trees, we looked for usable and enjoyable characteristics. Primary differences among our choices include stands for live or artificial trees and those for large or small trees.</p> <p>Revolving tree stands with ample accommodations for decorations made the cut as did those with toggle switches for selection of operational modes. We included tree stands that play music while they rotate as well as one model that functions via remote control. Rotating stands made of both metal and plastic made the list, with metal stands filling the need for heavy-duty support of larger trees.</p>"
whirlpool dishwashers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Compared to some other household appliances, choosing a dishwasher is rather straightforward. Dishwashers tend to have fewer fancy features than refrigerators or washing machines, but their relative simplicity makes performance all the more important—the best dishwashers get dishes sparkling clean with little effort on your part.</p> <p>We considered 15 Whirlpool dishwashers, judging each model based on performance. Through researching product specifications and reading reviews from trusted sources and consumers, we evaluated dishwashers based on ease of use, design, and cleaning performance. When it came to ease of use, we took ease of loading, capacity, and noise level into consideration. Design encompassed aesthetics, performance, and durability. Lastly, the dishwashers on our list have a good track record of cleaning and drying dishes; no prewashing or additional cycles needed.</p>"
dual zone wine fridges,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We considered more than 25 dual zone wine fridges to narrow down the best options for most homes. Personal wine collections vary almost as much as types of wine, so we chose a mix of freestanding and built-in fridges with a range of capacities and sizes to suit different needs.</p> <p>However, just cooling the wine isn’t enough, so we chose fridges with a range of protective features to maintain wine in optimal storage conditions. We chose wine fridges from reputable brands to ensure the fridge can reliably maintain a stable temperature and environment. Other features we looked for included a useful temperature range, double- or triple-layered UV-protective doors, adjustable shelving, and a sleek design to store wine in a unit that’s as fashionable as it is functional.</p>"
inground pool slides,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used several criteria while reviewing more than 25 slides to narrow the field to the best pool slides. Slide construction ranked high since it’s critical to the durability and safety of the slide. With that in mind, we only chose rigid slides with rotomolded plastic, which is strong enough to support high weight capacities, those that can endure the elements and those that are smooth enough to promote sliding. For the best inflatable pool slides, we stuck with those made from thick vinyl that won’t easily puncture. We also stuck with models with ample handrails and nonslip treads to prevent falls. Of course, slides are also supposed to be fun, so we went with models steep enough to ensure a zippy ride while still being safe.</p>"
soil for monstera,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Our top picks for the best soil for monstera plants encourage plant health. The best soil should retain moisture but still drain well so the plant will thrive. Some of these soils contain fertilizers, but if they don’t, it’s easy to add additional fertilizer if needed. To determine the best soil for monstera plants, we focused on ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite since these ingredients encourage optimal growth and root development. Additional factors include added nutrients, how well the soil drains and stays aerated, how well it retains moisture, and since monsteras like slightly acidic soil, the pH level. Our picks for the best soil for monstera plants will encourage healthy leaf and root growth while maintaining optimal moisture retention and drainage.</p>"
kneeling chair,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>To offer ergonomic benefits, a kneeling chair must fit the user. Though most kneeling chair types offer good back-pain relief, some are not adjustable, so it helps to know the average heights a chair will accommodate. In addition to adjustability, durability and weight limits mattered while choosing these picks, as did a chair’s angles. Seat comfort is also essential and requires good padding, upholstery, and distance from the seat to the shin pad.</p> <p>We considered the mobility of sitters while using a kneeling chair, along with the chair’s ability to roll on caster wheels. Finally, some chairs are easier to store, and a few chairs on this list, like the Varier Variable Balans Original Kneeling Chair, look so nice that there is no need to hide them.</p>"
jointer,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>In researching more than a dozen different jointers, we considered a variety of factors. A good jointer should have a motor that spins the blade fast enough to make smooth cuts. With that in mind, we stuck with jointers that reach a max speed of at least 10,000 rpms. Jointers are typically used to plane larger pieces of wood, so table length is important. For that reason, we leaned toward tables that were long enough to support longer workpieces.</p> <p>In addition to a long table, a good jointer should also have a fence that easily adjusts to cut at different angles. Finally, since jointers create precision cuts, it’s crucial that they be made from sturdy materials such as cast iron that won’t warp or bend over time.</p>"
toilet paper holder,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>When choosing bathroom fixtures, the humble toilet paper holder is easy to overlook.

Each cleaner is specially-formulated for certain stains, debris, and odors caused by coffee spills, pets, food, smoke, and mildew, with some having antibacterial properties.</p> <p>Select cleaners are made specifically for carpets, mats, and seats, including leather surfaces. For added convenience, some of these car carpet cleaners protect against future stains, come with deodorizers, and leave behind fresh scents.</p>"
chair mat,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We researched the most sought-after chair mats in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, compatibility with multiple surfaces, size, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best chair mats available, we found that the most popular types are plexiglass, polypropylene, tempered glass, polycarbonate, polyethylene, and PVC plastic. Each of these constructions provides ample durability to protect low-, medium-, and high-pile carpeting as well as vinyl, marble, and hardwood floors.</p> <p>For those offices that have carpeted floors, some of these options have cleats or studs built-in on the undersurface to keep them in place and smooth surfaces for easy rolling. Most of our picks also come in multiple sizes for small and large offices.</p>"
outdoor sectionals,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>A good outdoor sectional is comfortable, practical, and durable. We considered more than 30 sectionals when narrowing down this list.

Since the main attraction of a sectional is its modular design, we also chose several types of layouts (including a few flexible modular options) to fit differently sized patios and porches.</p> <p>We looked for durable materials that are easy to clean and maintain. Through extensive product research and consideration of online reviews, we also prioritized comfort by choosing cozy sectionals for hosting and relaxing.

small dehumidifier,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>We used several criteria to narrow the field of dehumidifiers down to the top picks for our list. A dehumidifier should be capable of removing a significant amount of water vapor from the air. With that in mind, we chose models that had the capacity and dehumidifying power to remove enough moisture to lower the humidity in at least a 150-square-foot room.</p> <p>Since dehumidifiers have basins with a limited capacity, we chose models with auto-shutoff features that turn the unit off when the water tank is full, preventing overflows. The dehumidifier’s dimensions were also an important factor when making our selections. We chose full-size dehumidifiers for basements and living areas and compact models for small spaces, such as in an RV, crawl space, closet, or bathroom.</p>"
pin nailers,"<h2>How We Chose our top picks</h2><p>Choosing the best pin nailers took a lot of work. We had to call upon all of our experience in DIY projects, woodworking, and finish carpentry to choose the features we thought we’d need most.</p> <p>With the important features nailed down, we conducted extensive product research to compile a list of tools we felt might meet our needs. Once we had our list, we compared the features and the pros and cons, as well as the prices, to ensure they would get the job done while providing enough value.</p> <p>We tossed to the side the pin nailers that didn’t make it and focused on the models that did. We gave each tool an award based on its strengths, creating this list of the best pin nailers.</p>"
