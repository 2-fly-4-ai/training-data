98,tactical pens,"<p>It's late on a lonely Friday. Instead of going out on the town with your friends, you're suffering through another night of standing duty. The phone rings. It's the front gate; they've apprehended someone from your unit for driving drunk and need you to fill out paperwork.</p><p>After walking to the ECP (because only the duty officer gets GOV keys and he's been racked out since 2100), you realize that all of your dreams are coming true. The drunk idiot is your first sergeant; the one with the flat-top who always chews you out for wearing ""eccentric"" shoes to the gym after work. Who's that in the passenger seat? Not his wife, but a chain-smoking stripper. And you get to write it all down in the logbook for time immemorial.</p><p>This is where things take a turn for the worse. He's belligerent and refuses to step out of the car. The door is locked. Ever prepared, you whip out your trusty tactical pen, smash the car window into a million pieces and drag the drunk first sergeant out of the vehicle to the wild cheers of base security, the nearby barracks residents, and Uncle Sam.</p><p>Tactical pens might as well have been invented for exactly this kind of situation. When else would you need to switch so quickly from writing, to breaking tempered glass, to physical conflict? That's a weirdly specific sequence of events. Consider tactical pens a variation of the multitool: they pack a variety of travel-sized gadgets into a convenient package you can carry every day. We put these tactical pens to the test.</p>",729
73,holographic sights,"<p>Holographic sights are a unique type of gunsight that uses lasers to create a reticle that appears to ""float"" in front of the weapon in your field of view. They work by illuminating a reticle image stored on holographic film within the window, creating a precise image. By creating a reconstructed image rather than simply projecting a LED dot or crosshair onto a pane of glass, they ensure that the image is unaffected by things like astigmatism, magnification, and even a cracked objective lens. The sight adjusts for windage and elevation by tilting the holographic grating, and the brightness is adjusted by raising or lowering the intensity of the laser.</p><p>With all this in mind, here's what you should know when selecting your very own holographic sight.</p>",487
106,multitools military veterans,"<p>I have a love-hate relationship with multitools. When there's a task to be done, whether it is stripping electrical wire, driving a Phillips head screw without stripping it, or cutting through oak dowels, I prefer proper electrician's pliers, Phillips head screwdrivers, and carpentry saws. What I'm not looking for are compact tools ill-suited for the task that are jumbled up in a clumsy, heavy, metal contraption. The best multitools are elegant in their simplicity, but they are few and far between.</p><p>But, when I'm far from my workshop, I have to admit, a good multitool does come in handy. The great astrophysicist and astronomer Carl Sagan once said, ""The uniqueness of humans has been claimed on many grounds, but most often because of our tool-making, culture, language, reason, and morality."" Our tool use is one of the main things that differentiates us from other animals on the planet and humans have carried and used multitools for millennia. One of the earliest known multitools has been dated to the Middle Roman period in the 2nd Century CE, and everyone's familiar with the Swiss Army knives first made by Victorinox in 1897 and popularized during World War II with their iconic red handles</p><p>With all that said, multitools remain very popular with members of the military and veteran communities, so your loyal team of gear reviewers here have tested a selection of the best multitools in order to help you sort the truly useful from the trash.</p>",428
265,portable coffee makers military deployment,"<p>We know from research that caffeine, the most commonly consumed psychoactive drug in the world, actually makes you smarter. When we consume coffee, caffeine enters our bloodstream and ends up in our brains. Once there, caffeine blocks an inhibitory neurotransmitter called adenosine and unleashes norepinephrine and dopamine (love that stuff) which increases the firing of neurons and improves brain function in terms of mood, energy levels, memory, reaction time, and more. It helps the human body burn fat, contains needed essential nutrients like magnesium and niacin, and might protect us from Alzheimer's, dementia, and Parkinson's. And damn, it just feels good. Ok, you didn't come here to watch me geek out about neuroscience. You're wondering what portable coffee maker you should buy.</p><p>Over the past few months, I've braved near-lethal doses of caffeine (yes, too much is bad) to test these products so you don't have to. </p>",415
32,reloading kit,"<p>If you've walked into a sporting goods store recently, you probably looked at the shelves and felt like you were a month late for the zombie apocalypse. Go ahead and ask for 5.56 and watch the sales staff either double over laughing or look at you like you just dropped straight from space.I've even had trouble finding basic non-defense ammunition like 12-gauge practice loads. Apparently, everyone else decided to take their angst out on those poor clay pigeons, too.</p><p>One way to get around the high prices and low supplies of ammunition shortages is to simply make it yourself. Reloading requires a great deal of care and precision, but it can be done and is a valuable skill for any shooting enthusiast. Reloading kits are fairly expensive, but the lifetime savings over buying factory ammunition more than make up for it. Of course, the dirty little secret is that nobody actually saves money reloading - they just spend the same amount and shoot more - but that's ok. The sooner you pick up one of these kits, the sooner you can start reaping the rewards.</p><p>Once you decide to enter the money pitI mean responsible recycling practiceof reloading your own ammunition, you'll need to decide how far down the rabbit hole you want to go. Basic kits are relatively affordable and can produce small batches of live rounds in a reasonable amount of time. Get into a rhythm, throw on your favorite TV show or podcast, and knock out a day's worth of ammo after work. If you want to get serious about reloading, advanced systems streamline the process to be more efficient, consistent, and versatile. They can also handle multiple calibers by swapping out a few components. This kind of setup will cost a lot more and require dedicated space in your house, but it is the best way to produce large amounts of ammunition in a short amount of time with very little deviation. Many competitive shooters even prefer to load this way instead of relying on mass-produced or even match-grade ammunition.</p><p>We're here to help you make sense of all these options with a gear guide that breaks it down and recommends a few of the best reloading kits available</p>",370
320,survival lighter,"<p>Gear lists may be mission-dependent, but your everyday carry items need to be reliable in all situations. Never let yourself be the one with a dull EDC knife or some new piece of gear you haven't tested. The whole point of EDC items is to be prepared for a wide range of situations at all times. Maybe that means lighting a fire during a survival situation. Maybe it means making the most of your break in the smoke pit. Either way, it's no time for your lighter to fail.</p><p>Most people are content with a cheap, unreliable lighter from the checkout counter at the gas station. Some pay top dollar for a refillable lighter that still struggles to light in the wind. That's because those people are using technology that hasn't changed in ages. Sure, it's more refined than striking rocks over pine pitch, but not by much.</p><p>Take a step forward with the TG plasma lighter.</p><p>Instead of lighter fluid and a wick, this lighter uses two electric arcs to generate enough heat to start a fire. This design is totally unaffected by wind and water. The battery takes two hours to fully charge and lasts for 300 uses. Make it part of your EDC list and put your trust in a reliable lighter that never leaks or blows out.</p><p>The thick rubber housing protects against hard drops and dunks in water. Short-circuit protection means you don't have to worry about ruining your investment with a little water. When not in use, the push-to-open lid can be locked closed for safekeeping.</p><p>Tactical gear makes everything from tools to clothing for the dynamic environments encountered in military, law enforcement, and outdoor life. This lighter was built to withstand everything you encounter without missing a beat.</p><p>If you regularly use a lighter, this should absolutely be on your gear list. Because it runs on a rechargeable battery, it pays for itself in no time. No more rushed trips to the gas station or spilling lighter fluid during a refill. After all, your everyday carry is supposed to make life easier, right?",344
58,skinning knives,"<p>Let's face it: Hunting, done correctly, is not easy.</p><p>For most serious hunters, there are hours upon hours of preparation leading up to the hunt. You could spend potentially marriage-ending amounts of time scouting terrain, mastering a bow and arrow, rifle, or shotgun, acquiring the proper attire, erecting treestands or hunting blinds, clearing firing lanes, gaining proficiency in animal calls, researching supplementary gear (binos, rangefinders, etc), deodorizing clothes, and even spraying deer pee on the ground and maybe on your boots. Then there's the patience - the long wait for your prey to arrive, validating your obsession. It can be painful sometimes, but you wait and that big buck finally walks in. The stars align and you get a shot. Your practice pays off, and the deer drops after a short run. You kneel down and stroke the animal's fur, feeling a twist of emotions. You thank the animal for its sacrifice and for the meat it will provide you and your family. Now comes the unpleasant task of field dressing and skinning the animal. You retrieve the dull, Swiss Army knock-off you've been carrying since fourth grade and start stabbing away. Right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>For a hobby of immense preparation, many people lose focus on the tasks required after the point of impact. We put so much thought into how to get the animal, we don't think a lot about what's required afterward - and a quality skinning knife can be the difference between a good day and a great day when you're out in the field with a buck at your feet. Technically, any knife can be a skinning knife, but some knives are better suited than others and it only makes sense you'd want to carry the best.</p><p>In this buying guide, we'll break down our choices for the best skinning knives available, why we choose them, and how they're best utilized. In addition, we'll talk about the key features important to you, as a hunter, and how to make your decision based on your specific hunting needs. Let the hunt begin!</p>",340

74,tritium watches,"<p>Start a search for watches, and you can quickly find yourself deep in a rabbit hole of products and opinions. With so many quality brands and styles to choose from, it's no wonder so many people have become watch collectors. Just remember that what makes a watch ideal for one situation doesn't mean it's a good fit for another. If you value low-light visibility, we highly recommend upgrading from digital screens and glow-in-the-dark paint. You deserve the same kind of technology that militaries around the world have been using for decades: tritium watches.</p><p>Tritium is naturally occurring, but very rare. It can also be produced as a byproduct of nuclear energy. Because it glows for decades without needing to be charged by external light, it offers a fantastic way to make things like watches, compasses, and sights visible at night. If you want a tactical advantage or just appreciate fail-proof technology, picking up a tritium watch is the way to go.</p><p>Most of the watches that use tritium gas tubes are field watches designed for some kind of tactical environment. Tritium is more expensive than luminous paint, so prices tend to be a little higher than the average field watch. Because of that, many watchmakers assume that buyers looking for tritium are also willing to pay more for other high-end features like complex automatic movement, sapphire crystal, and extreme levels of waterproofing. Add all that up, and you basically get a dive watch that can easily break the $1,000 mark. Those watches are incredibly capable and built to be handed down to the next generation. Still, there are exceptions. We found several tritium watches that don't cost anywhere near that much and still perform a lot of the same functions. </p><p>Tritium watches aren't what we'd call common in the watch world, but you do have options. We also threw in a serviceable field watch with traditional luminous paint to keep your spirits up.Here are some of the best tritium watches on the market worth looking at.</p>",334
120,binoculars for hunting,"<p>When it comes to finding the best binoculars for hunting, there's always more than meets the eye. Having the right optics can be the difference between putting meat on the table and just taking a glorified hike in the woods. There's a plethora of factors to consider when finding the right hunting binoculars and it's important to understand how each functionality applies to your particular needs.</p><p>Growing up in western Michigan with a deer-hunter dad, I am no stranger to hunting binoculars. Some of my earliest memories involve being wedged into the fold-out seats of my dad's '96 Ford Ranger Super Cab and driving around at dusk, ""scouting"" for deer. Now we weren't out shining deer or doing anything illegal if that's what you're thinking. In fact, my dad had a consistent place where he'd bow hunt from, but I think driving around, scouting for deer, got him amped up for hunting season. Growing up in a town with lots of far-reaching cornfields, deer weren't always easy to see and my dad always kept a pair of hunting binoculars in the door of his truck to ensure he could get an accurate count of the herd or the rack of a buck.</p><p>Occasionally, my brother and I would get to fight over first dibs on the binoculars, and he, being four years older, would usually win. But when it was my turn to look, I remember frequently struggling to locate close groups of deer or take the shake out of long-distance looks. I always figured that was just the nature of binoculars. Boy, was I wrong.</p><p>In the review below, I hope to not only give you some good recommendations on quality binos, but also share some of the technical aspects I've learned over the years and how they relate to the individual need. Hopefully, it will leave you in a better place for making an informed decision before your next big hunt. And hopefully, it will help you put some meat in the freezer.</p>",332
110,tomahawks,"<p>Practically speaking, tomahawks have long been a utilitarian solution for survival and woodworking. Make them light enough to throw, and you've got yourself one of the most badass melee weapons of all time. Knuckle dusters and spiked flails may be things of the past, but the glorious tomahawk lives on, and it's better than ever. Modern tactical tomahawks are almost too good to be true. We're firm believers that anyone who uses a tomahawk in combat should be awarded a special medal emblazoned with Mel Gibson's face. While we work on getting that approved by the Defense Department, you go ahead and pick your weapon of choice. These tomahawks belong not on the frontier or on some distant battlefield, but amongst us, and our jealous friends must learn of our awesome tomahawk with their own eyes.</p><p>In the off-chance that you don't strike the war story lottery and find yourself slaying baddies with your tomahawk, there are plenty of other ways to put it to use. I've used my Aplhatraz commemorative tomahawk (shoutout to BOC 10-1) to chop firewood on occasion, and it's a hell of a lot easier to carry on my camping pack than a full-size ax or even a hatchet. Most tomahawks are sharp enough for all kinds of campsite chores. Since they're designed for throwing, you could even rustle up some friends and create an ax-throwing leagueassuming you can find a suitable venue. Fair warning, neighbors aren't always thrilled with such activities.</p><p>It's a marvel that such incredible tomahawks not only exist but can arrive on your doorstep in a matter of hours. We're spoiled for choice, too. For less than you'd spend on a casual night at the bars, you can score an old-school tomahawk or a futuristic composite one with all the latest materials. Maybe it's time to start a collection to rival your friends' knife and watch collections. Now, how many references to The Patriot can I fit in this article? Read on to find out.</p>",331
67,iron sights,"<p>Backup iron sights - and primary iron sights, for that matter - are an important part of many rifle setups. Slapping a pair onto the top rail of an AR is so easy and affordable that it's hard to argue against doing just that. While we cover a lot of the latest and greatest cutting-edge gear here, a recent range day saw commerce editor Daniel Terrill and I getting reacquainted with iron sights and a 20-inch barrel - and it felt just like old times.</p><p>For the purposes of this guide, we selected some of the less common options to try alongside the tried and true A2 carry handle we grew up on during our respective time in the Marine Corps. On the test bench for this gear guide were the UTG Mil-Spec Carry Handle, Trijicon CP250 replacement sights, and Ultradyne C4 backup iron sights. Of course, there were also a few easy selections like the Magpul BUIS and Daniel Defense Rock & Lock AR-15 Iron Sights.</p><p>Our assistant for the day was the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Volunteer VX DMR. The M&P 15 is one of the most popular ARs in the U.S., partially because of the model's accessible price of entry. The entry-level M&P 15 Sport II starts at an MSRP of just $788. Of course, many bargain-basement ARs don't stay in stock very long. One of the first things owners do is start upgrading low-hanging fruit like the trigger, bolt carrier group, charging handle, and furniture. The Volunteer VX DMR takes the work out of customizing a new AR-15 with key upgrades like a PWS 556 muzzle brake, B5 Systems stock and pistol grip, Radian Raptor-LT charging handle, and flat-faced trigger. Add options like the 20-inch barrel and flip-up irons, and the result is a rifle that's ready to rock out of the box with a starting MSRP of $1,599 as tested.</p>",314
197,snow boots for men,"<p>Gentlemen, winter is when we do some of our best work. Long months of shortened daylight and frigid temperatures are your time to shine. Chop wood, pull fish out of frozen lakes, and drive a team of sled dogs through a blizzard to deliver medicine to kids–you know, be legendary. In between your acts of heroism, you might find yourself shoveling the driveway or building snowmen with the kids. No matter what winter throws at you, give your feet the protection they need with a pair of quality snow boots. If the cold is making you numb, water is soaking your socks, or snow is falling into your boots, you won't be much good to anyone. Luckily, there are plenty of options that provide just what you need.</p><p>The thing is, all snow boots are not the same. Staying warm and dry all winter isn't as easy as picking the best boot and being done with it. As with any piece of gear, the key is matching your equipment to the tasks at hand. The most rugged boots are unbelievably warm, but they'll also have you walking like the world's scariest paranormal creature. Lightweight boots are nearly as lightweight as high-top sneakers, but they sacrifice a lot of insulation in the name of comfort. Most of you can probably get by with something in the middle, but if you live someplace where winter is the dominant season, it's worth investing in different snowboots for different activities.</p><p>We found snow boots that even a Viking would be proud to wear in the harshest conditions and a few lighter options for enjoying milder winters as a man about town. We scoured the men's snow boot market to find options for every use and budget. Read on to learn about the features and materials that make each of these boots worthy of a spot on our gear roundup.</p>",313
23,shooting ear protection,"<p>For years, special operations types have enjoyed powered shooting ear protection that not only shielded their ears from harsh sounds and blast pressure but also provided integrated communications and computer-enhanced bionic hearing. Regular Joes often buy their own to get in on the cool-guy factor (and save themselves from premature hearing loss), but unfortunately, not all powered hearing protection is created equal. On Amazon alone, there are legions of imitators, subpar offerings, and ""American-made"" headsets that are not officially certified in any way to protect your hearing.</p><p>With this in mind, we set out to compile an exhaustive list of the best shooting ear protection on the market, based on professional military usage, sport shooting, and expert opinions. Most powered hearing protection systems feature microphones that playback noise through headphone speakers in real-time, allowing for stereophonic situational awareness of your surroundings while protecting your hearing from damage due to gunshots, explosions, power tools, or even artillery fire. In addition to standard powered hearing protection systems, we've included more costly options that allow for integrated communications should you need them for military, first responder, or personal use.</p><p>All options on this list were physically evaluated for the purposes of this review and all are officially certified and ready for anything. As a rule, everything on this list is commercially available, so if you don't see things like TEA Hi-Threats or Invisio X50s it's because they don't generally sell to civilians. In addition, there are several obscure options, like the full-size Otto Noizebarriers and Silynx Clarus Pro, and more common options like the Comtac V and VI that we couldn't test just due to time constraints and availability. Finally, every pair of hearing protection on this list is officially certified to undergo use in high noise environments to include military usage, something prices will reflect accordingly -although it's cheaper than the medical bills for hearing damage.</p>",312
152,waterproof backpacks,"<p>It only took about a minute into testing for this article before I started asking myself why everyone doesn't own a waterproof backpack. I have several bags of my own; backpacks, duffels, range bags, gym bags, carry-on luggage - you name it. You probably have an assortment, too. So why is it that they all turn into sponges as soon as the weather turns wet?</p><p>Backpackers will tell you that one of the most important pieces of gear they own is a rain cover for their pack. Once gear gets wet, it can be extremely difficult to dry it out and you can suffer serious health consequences as a result. Even if all you're doing is commuting or going for a day hike, a soggy backpack can ruin the experience. That's where the best waterproof backpacks come in.</p><p>To chase down the best products and deals out there, I scoured retailers, forums, and online communities to see what customers like and don't like about waterproof backpacks. Then, I rounded up a selection to put through the wringer first-hand. Some are built for hiking, some are designed for use around town, and some are made to endure hours of hostile weather on the deck of a boat - no matter the intent or design, I had no mercy on these bags. To test real-world waterproof capability, they all got packed to the gills, sprayed with water, left in the rain for an hour, then thrown into a puddle. I also loaded each one with appropriate cargo and lugged it around to see just how good it was at being a normal backpack.</p><p>After testing some of the best waterproof backpacks on the market, I'd say opting for all-weather capability from the jump is the way to go. Here's how all of our testing shook out - and which waterproof backpack is probably best for your needs.</p>",312
139,heat lamps,"<p>Winter is coming. You know what must be done. That's right, get those fires roaring and spike that cider because back porch living might be even better when the temperatures drop. Some people hunker down all winter and subject themselves to cabin fever, and those people are doing it wrong. We have warm clothes, we have drinks that warm our insides, and grills work just fine in the snow, thank you very much. The last piece of this puzzle is a heat lamp to melt the frost right off of that patio and give you a comfy place to kick back and relax. These heaters are safe, generate plenty of heat, and can extend your back porch living into an all-season arrangement.</p><p>There are so many styles of heat lamps to choose from that we're willing to be there's something that checks all your boxes. If you're on a tight budget or only need to heat a small area like a garage or sunroom, you can score a heat lamp for as little as $65. If you want to go toe-to-toe with winter, add a few commercial heat lamps to your patio and melt a warm oasis into the snow. There are even options on this list with enough power to crank out 48,000 BTU of heat. That's enough for outdoor restaurants and event venues, so it'll be plenty for your wintertime festivities.</p><p>I've always believed that people who hate the cold are probably victims of improper clothing (and maybe a peppermint schnapps deficiency). The cooler seasons offer some of the best views, and there's no reason to lock yourself inside for months at a time. Dress in layers, pour yourself a steamy drink, and crank up the heat lamp so you can enjoy your backyard year-round. You're paying for it all year, so you might as well enjoy it.</p>",308
109,wood splitting maul,"<p>Were you born wearing steel-toed boots? Does your wardrobe consist entirely of flannel shirts and blue jeans? Do you brush your teeth with snowmelt and use pine pitch for deodorant? Are these concepts preposterous but a little bit relatable at the same time? If so, you're the kind of person who needs to split their own logs. Free yourself from the shame that comes with buying firewood that's been split for you. Let us show you the way to lumberjack heaven.</p><p>Chopping firewood is one thing, but splitting it is an important step that requires the right tool for the job. Adding a maul to your collection can enable you to make quick work of logs and prepare for winter like an expert survivalist. Even if you never travel the forest felling trees with a single swing like Paul Bunyan, you can still split cords of firewood by hand if you have the right maul. That's where I come in.</p><p>When people find out how much joy I get from splitting firewood, they usually look at me like I'm some kind of social deviant. How can manual labor be fun? For starters, it's a great way to release stress without winding up on your command blotter. Splitting wood is also an exercise in technique, so you can take genuine pride in getting better at it. I'm also of the opinion that fires smell better when you don't pay someone else to split the logs for you. Regardless of your reasoning, it's time to add a maul to your tool set. Traditional mauls look and function like sledgehammers; big, heavy, two-handed affairs. You can also get one-handed mauls or simple iron wedges for light duty. There are even hydraulic wood splitters that I contend will not provide the same lumberjack experience, but will process firewood quickly and easily nonetheless.</p>",306
7,handgun safes,"<p>If you're not using it, the safest place for a handgun to be is stored in a handgun safe. You put the cookies in the cookie jar, the milk in the fridge, and your money in the bank, and none of those things can take human life as quickly as a handgun. I doubt there's more than a handful of readers out there who have their firearms laying around on desks, tables, or chairs, and are tripping over them on the way to the bathroom, but there are a lot of choices out there when it comes down to how and where you'll secure your weapon when not in use.</p><p>You can get lost for hours down the rabbit hole of gun safes and pick up a huge 6-foot-tall safe that will hold a pile of rifles and has shelf storage for a dozen pistols and hundreds of boxes of ammunition, but that is not what we're focusing on today. Instead, we'll be focusing solely on handgun storage with quick access for one or two pistols, with maybe enough room for a spare magazine. Think bedside storage and home defense, not the weapons depot from 'Boondock Saints' or your local gun shop. Everyone has their own requirements, but for the most part, I took the view that we want a pistol safe that will prevent anyone but myself (such as children or guests) from accessing it immediately and won't break the bank. If it's hidden or looks nice, that's a bonus, and high build quality is more important than price, but at today's ammunition prices, a penny saved is a penny earned.</p><p>More than two dozen pistol safes were considered, including everything from wall safes to hidden safes to vaults and car safes. Read on for our top picks and why they stand out as the best.</p>",305

82,fishing backpacks,"<p>The best fishing backpacks can mean the difference between a relaxing morning on the water landing fish or a frustrating, under-equipped excursion. Fishing rivers, remote ponds, and large lakes can be a trial of trails just to get to your favorite fishing hole, and the last thing you need or want is to have to turn around and make multiple trips to your vehicle because you forgot your bait, favorite lure, fly box, or, God forbid, your fishing rod.</p><p>If you're like me, you spent a lot of your youth fishing out of a plastic tackle box with fold-out trays that never quite closed over the secondhand tackle pilfered from your father's gear. If so, you probably remember the looming fear of that tackle box inevitably getting dropped or kicked over, causing the inside to become a catastrophic mess of iron sinkers, swivels, oversized fluorescent bobbers, and rusty barbed hooks, just waiting for a misplaced finger. The tacklebox setup was all well and good when fishing a backyard pond for bluegill and the all-to-frequent bullhead, but as I've gotten older, my wanderings have gotten further and a normal fishing excursion usually involves a fair amount of hiking, which can quickly turn from tranquil to terrible when loaded down with more cumbersome tackle than two hands can carry.</p><p>Enter the fishing backpack: With a decent pack, you can put aside the need for a hand-carry tackle box and slip into your favorite fishing hole with ease. That said, not every angler is in it for the same species of fish or utilizes the same fishing style, so you should choose a fishing backpack best suited to your own personal practices. With this in mind, we've put together a list of our favorite fishing backpacks, to help you maximize your time with your line in the water.</p>",303
319,backpacking sleeping pads,"<p>To anyone who has never camped or backpacked before, sleeping pads may appear as just a small mattress used for comfort. This is one of the roles they play, but the primary purpose is to insulate you from the ground. Our bodies create heat to keep us warm and functioning, but that heat is constantly transferring from us to the air and things we touch.</p><p>Staying warm is about reducing the amount of heat that is transferred as much as possible. When you lay directly on the ground, or with a very thin barrier like your sleeping bag, then your entire body is transferring heat to the earth. Bare dirt and rock are huge heat sponges that suck the heat from you like a vacuum. Take it from me, selecting a quality sleeping pad could mean the difference between a restful or a restless slumber.</p><p>The importance of sleeping pads may not seem apparent to many, but it's something I learned the hard way. In late 2006, I was a brand new Marine going through training at the School of Infantry in Camp Pendleton.For the majority of the three-month training, we were out in the field and slept under the stars. Each evening, set up our sleeping gear in formation and when we woke up, we were expected to pack away everything in just a few minutes.</p><p>To save time in the morning, I skipped rolling out my Improved Sleeping Mat (ISO-mat) and instead just slept on the ground. I thought I was smarter than everyone because I didn't have to roll up and pack up my ISO mat. But I also woke up cold everyone morning. Looking back, I can't help but laugh at how long it took me to realize why I was so uncomfortable.</p>\",294
146,molle pouches,"<p>Dedicated magazine pouches to haul ammunition have existed for as long as firearms have been a part of warfare, and for the last half-century, the average American warfighter has utilized pouches specifically to carry the venerable STANAG magazine that feeds most of the 5.56x45mm self-loading rifles on the market.</p><p>But these aren't the days of sloshing through the jungle with your M-1956 harness, no armor, and a bloodstream full of THC and lysergic acid. After twenty years of the War on Terror, nearly every weapons system has improved amazingly, to include magazine pouches, going beyond what previously amounted to cloth bags and featuring technologies to allow you to quickly retrieve fresh magazines without making the pouch unable to retain mags. These technologies include bungees, elastic, Kydex thermoplastic liners, and plastic claws that are all tightenable, all to the end of providing a critical balance between retention and speed.</p><p>To that end, we've gathered a list of some of the best AR-15 and M4 magazine pouches, no matter what your use or budget. Some of these options will be more suited to military or tactical use, while others will be better for competition shooting where factors like noise discipline and sand infiltration may not be as big of an issue. All magazine pouches presented today are made in the United States by trusted manufacturers, many of them with NSNs for military use. Because of that, the average cost may be higher, but trust me when I say it's worth the extra cash.</p><p>I'm basing my analysis off of pouches that I've personally used for both leisure and military shooting, so your personal favorite may not be included. Feel free to provide your favorite in the comments below if we missed one of your preferred options.</p>",291
261,adjustable dumbbells,"<p>The best adjustable dumbbells can take your home gym to the next level. Don't have a home gym? Well, congratulations, because the right set of adjustable dumbbells is a great first step to creating your very own home gym. In fact, some might consider adjustable dumbbells to be the ""gateway drug"" of home gym equipment addicts. Sure, it starts with adjustable dumbbells, but then you need an adjustable bench to get a proper chest workout, and next thing you know you're sweating it out on a $5,000 stair-stepper, with a shake weight in each hand, and a Jawzrsize ball in your mouth. But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p><p>In the time of coronavirus and quarantines (or if you're heading into the long dark winter of the north country like me), having a home gym can be essential for those days when you can't make it to the gym or if you just prefer to grunt, groan, and sweat in the comfort of your own basement. The problem, however, is that with home gyms, real estate is a premium, and being able to maximize your space often becomes the name of the game. For this purpose, adjustable dumbbells are a no-brainer, eliminating the need for row after row of individually weighted dumbbells.</p><p>In the following list, we'll break down the top brands of adjustable dumbbells and give you the best recommendations for sculpting your guns at home. For the purpose of this list, we have limited the reviewed products to adjustable dumbbell sets utilizing internal mechanisms for (nearly automatic) weight adjustment and excluded those that require the manual changing of disc plates and collars. Read on and let's see which of the best adjustable dumbbells is the right fit for you.</p>",288

76,combat boots,"<p>Of all the uniform items you use on a daily basis, your combat boots might have the most significant impact on your ability to do your job. If you've ever gutted out a ruck march or hump with blisters and shin splints, you know what I'm talking about. The same goes for everyone who's completed an entire field exercise with soaking wet feet, or lugged heavy combat boots through unit PT.</p><p>I bet I had at least four pairs of combat boots in rotation at any given time. I had my everyday boots that just had to look good and be comfortable. My trusty Bates Lites came out for the CFT and any kind of boots-and-utes PT. Deployment called for the rugged, but rather ugly, RAT boots. Finally, I had inspection boots that only came out of my closet for inspections and ceremonies. Mind you this was in the earthly paradise that is southern California. If I had to deal with rain and snow, I would have had even more. Each pair had its own set of advantages and capabilities. As much as it sucks to buy uniform items you rarely wear, I do think having several pairs of boots is a winning strategy. It would suck to trash your only pair of combat boots doing PT on the one morning the CO decides to get to know you.</p><p>Do yourself a favor and wear appropriate combat boots. What that means for you might change from day to day, so you should probably invest in a few different styles. This list has boots for hot weather, cold weather, running, heavy equipment operation, and the color requirements for every branch of service. Read on to find your next pair.</p>",286
75,bore sight,"<p>So, you picked up a firearm or slick new optic. Now is the time to sight that bad boy in so it can do more than look cool and take up room in your gun case. There are many ways to do this, but one of the easiest is to use a bore sight. For what you'd spend on a box of ammunition, you can reduce the amount of time and money you'll spend walking your shots onto a target at the range. Most rifle shooters will establish zero at either 25, 36, or 50 yards. The Armory Life has a solid breakdown of this information if you aren't familiar with the reasoning behind each approach.</p><p>Once you've got your sights dialed in, you can use the same bore sight to work on trigger control. That's right; snapping in is one of the best ways to improve as a shooter. Dry-firing lets you pile up repetitions without firing a shot or driving out to the range. By adding a bore sight to your routine, you can watch what happens to your point of aim throughout your trigger pull and diagnose poor execution before it becomes a habit. Tiny movements that are hard to spot on your sights become easy to spot when they're ratted out by a laser beam sweeping across your wall with every trigger pull.</p><p>Bore sights that cost between $20 and $50 tend to offer the best balance of features and price, but even budget bore sights can get the job done. Low-cost options tend to be caliber-specific. That's fine if you only have firearms chambered in one or two calibers, but individual bore sights can get expensive if you own a larger collection.</p>",285
134,camping tarps,"<p>If I had a nickel for every time someone asked for my thoughts on the market's best camping tarps, I'd have -well - no nickels. Unfortunately (and unwisely), camping tarps are often a piece of equipment that gets minimal dedicated thought, which is curious because a good camping tarp can be the difference between a good, all-weather camping trip and a cold, wet, miserable time. In Michigan, we have a saying: ""Don't like the weather? Wait five minutes and it'll change."" This may be a saying in other places too, but it was obviously stolen from us. The point is, if you're going to spend some time in the wilderness, you best be prepared for what Mother Nature has to throw at you.</p><p>I learned this first-hand in my Army-tomfoolery and over several decades of backwoods camping, but on occasion drove home this point more so than last year's annual camping trip to the Pine River in mid-Michigan. For five days, it did nothing but rain and our campsite was transformed into a ""tarp city"" with big sheets of waterproof canvas tied off in all directions to protect our hammocks, tents, and cooking gear. Some of our tarps were good. Some were not. Either way, I quickly learned the importance of this, sometimes overlooked, piece of camping gear.</p><p>In the sections below, I'll provide a list of recommendations for the best camping tarps available, and their recommended uses. I'll also talk about some of the key attributes you'll want to look for when making your purchase. Hopefully, you'll walk away with a newfound respect for this simple piece of gear and you'll stay nice and dry on your next trip to the woods.</p>",281
189,snow boots for women,"<p>After slogging around with wet, cold feet for four days on the Appalachian Trail after a freak March snowstorm dropped a foot of snow in Pennsylvania, I became a firm believer in investing in a pair of the best snow boots for women. It was a sustained level of misery I had only ever experienced during Marine Corps training, where my fellow Marines and I were often equipped with gear that had often been around since the Vietnam War era. When I was on active duty, I knew that this type of misery was just part of the package; now that I am retired, however, I am not willing to sacrifice my comfort and safety for bragging rights.</p><p>Our feet are critical to our comfort in frigid temps. Because they have so many blood vessels, the warmer our feet are, the greater circulation and blood flow we have throughout the body, making it much easier to regulate our body temperature. Whether you have to crunch through ice, snow, and slush just to walk your dog, or you have plans for an extended adventure in the great outdoors, a good set of the best snow boots for women will prevent your feet from turning into frozen blocks of ice and ensure your winter experience doesn't turn into a big suck fest.</p><p>What makes for a trusty pair of snow boots? To take the mystery out of finding a pair that will work for your winter needs without breaking the bank, we tested a variety of snow boots to bring you the best the shoe world has to offer at a variety of price points. Here's what our research and testing revealed.</p>",278

88,ghillie suits,"<p>The ghillie suit is one of the most iconic pieces of individual kit you will find in the military. For snipers, it is a vital piece of gear that has remained conceptually unchanged since it was first employed by Scottish gamekeepers in the late nineteenth century. The word ghillie (gille) is of Scottish origin, but while its origins may appear modest, its impact on the battlefield is significant. Camouflage and concealment are essential hallmarks of fieldcraft for snipers in their traditional tactical roles.</p><p>Ghillie suits are designed to break up the human form that is easily distinguished from the natural environment either due to shape, color contrast, or reflectivity of light from our skin or inorganic surfaces (metal or glass). A common misconception is that the ghillie is designed to make you appear as a shrub or some other natural feature, but the objective of the ghillie is to conceal you and fully integrate you into the environment. Your goal is to not exist.</p><p>The best ghillie is perhaps the one that you make, spending countless hours sewing, gluing, and tying in jute. This is a very detailed, deliberate process that took me multiple evenings to complete during sniper school. Thankfully, the market offers some incredible alternatives that will save you time and provide you with a quality piece of kit. While the ghillie is often associated with the battlefield, its original purpose as a piece of field gear for the modern hunter is still applicable.</p><p>In the next few sections, I'll review some great products currently on the market tailored for either the tactical space or geared more specifically for those looking to utilize them recreationally or while hunting.</p>",277
115,dump pouches,"<p>From your average mag-dump-into-trash folks to LEO types to military folks, everyone can use a helping hand. That's where dump pouches come in. We have all been in that situation; where you wish you had more easily-accessible on-person storage without adding excessive bulk. Dump pouches are great for holding snacks, water, a phone, or sensitive items.</p><p>There are tons of mission sets out there that require gear. Likewise, there are tons of dump pouches out there that can foot the bill for these different types of missions. The key to a good dump pouch is finding one that: a) fits your mission parameters, and b) takes up the exact amount of real estate you are willing to allocate on your battle belt.</p><p>Luckily for you, I did the market research, testing, and evaluation so you don't have to. Below, you will find a comprehensive list of dump pouches that I would consider if I needed a helping hand.</p><p>How we tested</p><p>I searched far and wide all over forums, Reddit, and social media to look for the most talked about and well-received dump pouches. I was surprised to learn that there are so many options on the market. After brainstorming with several service members and recreational shooters, I compiled a list of reputable dump pouches and divided them up by potential use.</p><p>After dividing them up into the categories and uses that I thought they would be best suited for, I put all the dump pouches to the test at the range. Every. Single. One. I ran, jumped, slipped a few times, and crammed as many snacks and mags as I could to see how each performed.</p>",272
408,iron sights,"<p>Backup iron sights - and primary iron sights, for that matter - are an important part of many rifle setups. Slapping a pair onto the top rail of an AR is so easy and affordable that it's hard to argue against doing just that. While we cover a lot of the latest and greatest cutting-edge gear here, a recent range day saw commerce editor Daniel Terrill and I getting reacquainted with iron sights and a 20-inch barrel - and it felt just like old times.</p><p>For the purposes of this guide, we selected some of the less common options to try alongside the tried and true A2 carry handle we grew up on during our respective time in the Marine Corps. On the test bench for this gear guide were the UTG Mil-Spec Carry Handle, Trijicon CP250 replacement sights, and Ultradyne C4 backup iron sights. Of course, there were also a few easy selections like the Magpul BUIS and Daniel Defense Rock & Lock AR-15 Iron Sights.</p><p>Our assistant for the day was the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Volunteer VX DMR. The M&P 15 is one of the most popular ARs in the U.S., partially because of the model's accessible price of entry. Of course, many bargain-basement ARs don't stay in stock very long. One of the first things owners do is start upgrading low-hanging fruit like the trigger, bolt carrier group, charging handle, and furniture. The Volunteer VX DMR takes the work out of customizing a new AR-15 with key upgrades like a PWS 556 muzzle brake, B5 Systems stock and pistol grip, Radian Raptor-LT charging handle, and flat-faced trigger.</p>",270
26,survival kit,"<p>If Bear Grylls taught us anything, it's that a successful survival plan begins by immediately drinking as much of your own urine as possible. Once that's done, you can move on to things like creating a shelter, obtaining food, and navigating to safety. Having a kit prepared in advance can make all the difference. The thing is, you never know what kind of challenges you're going to face because real-life survival scenarios don't start with an airdrop into a predetermined location. If you're going to have a survival kit, you'd better make sure it's set up to succeed in the environments you're most likely to encounter.</p><p>You can still stack the deck in your favor by doing a practical analysis of the situations you're likely to face. What's most likely to present a challenge in your area? Start with the terrain and local climatefactors that are predictable. Pack a bug out bag with clothing that can keep you warm (or cool) and dry while you move to safety. How available is food? If you can't count on scavenging or hunting, you'll need to squirrel away enough calories to sustain you for several days at a minimum. Once that's taken care of, you can start to geek out on the fun stuff: survival gear. As always, don't forget to practice with whatever you buy. Sitting in a cold downpour on the edge of hypothermia is no way to experiment with a ferro rod for the first time.</p><p>Pre-assembled survival kits aren't what I'd consider all-inclusive, but they're a great starting point. Establish a foundation with a kit from the list below.</p>",268
143,cabin tents,"<p>Sizzling grills and designer-brand coolers get all the glory, but a good cabin tent is the unsung hero of a successful cookout or car camping trip. When you bring your family to a scenic park to celebrate the Fourth of July, Labor Day, or a weekend hotdog sale at your local grocery store, being able to get out of the sun and mosquitos can keep the temperature down in more ways than one. Comfortable, happy kids lead to a much more enjoyable cookout experience.</p><p>Even though using a cabin tent probably means you have a few extra sets of hands, transportation and setup will still factor into your buying decision. If you travel with a group of friends, spreading the tent, poles, fly, and other components won't be an issue, even if you're traveling by foot. If your family camping trips involve kids, you might want to look at options that are easy to set up with one or two people. Terrain is another factor since dispersed campsites can't be counted on to be as convenient as the flat, level pads at a campground. Weather and length of stay will determine how hardcore your tent needs to be. Lightweight tents are perfect for most recreational camping, but we found some seriously rugged options that can handle extended stays in all kinds of nasty weather. Some even have room for a stove and chimney.</p><p>There are plenty of sizes and styles of cabin tents available, so let us help you narrow down the selection with these top picks from some of the best outdoor adventure brands on the market.</p>",266
217,camping gear,"<p>When venturing into the backcountry, whether car camping or undertaking a multi-day backpacking trip, it's essential that you pack the right equipment. Some gear can make your life more comfortable and your trip more enjoyable, and other equipment can save your life. Venturing into the outdoors can be adventurous and fulfilling, but it also carries both objective and subjective risks - and the further you venture into the little-traveled backcountry, the more prepared and self-reliant you need to be. Something as simple as carrying a rain shell and warming layer can prevent an unexpected storm from turning into life-threatening hypothermia. Being prepared for the unexpected events nature can throw at you provides you considerable margin, so that you can enjoy all that nature has to offer while minimizing or mitigating risk. I've taken a look at the best gear on the market and picked our favorites to help you find the best hiking, backpacking, and camping gear that's right for you.</p><p>My views on what to carry in the backcountry was heavily influenced at a young age by a book published by The Mountaineers, a Pacific Northwest community of outdoors people, called Freedom of the Hills - considered to be the Bible of mountaineering for more than 60 years. Since the 1930s, the Mountaineers have recommended a list of 10 essential equipment items to be carried on every foray into the wild. The 10 essentials are:</p><p>I've built my list around these essential items. Here's what your camping gear should look like - and the best ways to make the most of it in the wilderness.</p>",264
55,backpack coolers,"<p>The dads of yore could have really used a backpack cooler. In my mind's eye, I still see the old man struggling on scorched sand - lugging metal folding chairs, thick canvas totes, and a hard case cooler. He lumbered beyond a quarter of a mile on those humidity-soaked summer days with sweat amassing from a scornful brow. He would responsibly set up the family's basecamp with veins like McDonald's straws pumping through muscled forearms. His sweat dripped to the sand, forming dark spots like islands around our newly claimed speck of earth. These memories make the lauded comedian Jim Gaffigan's punchline ring true when he says ""why is Dad always in such a bad mood?"" In stark contrast to the struggles of the past, today's fathers can place the heavy burden of six-packs and bologna sandwiches square on their shoulders via the innovative backpack cooler.</p><p>The backpack cooler has changed the game for our ability to bring the party to wherever you go. Why complete a strongman walk every time you want some ice-cold IPAs in the park? We were able to get my hands on the best lineup of backpack coolers available. So, I set out on a vision quest to find which cooler keeps my beer the frostiest, provides the most comfort, and still has the durability to last for years to come. After concluding my tests, it's apparent my son will reminisce on how effortlessly I hauled the family cooler without breaking a sweat, grinning ear to ear, and ready to take on the next adventure.</p>",259
169,solar generators,"<p>When it comes to being self-sufficient and prepared for anything, solar generators are one of the best investments you can make. When freak ice storms bombarded Texas in 2021, millions of people suddenly realized how perilous our access to energy actually is.</p><p>Even though a full-scale home solar setup might price out a lot of homeowners (and all renters), solar generators like the ones we included on this list present a much more accessible alternative. All the solar generators we picked can be powered from a wall outlet and be used as an emergency reserve, but they can also be paired with solar panels to reduce your monthly electric bill. If you have a beer fridge in the garage or a space heater in a workshop, a small solar setup can pay itself off surprisingly quickly.</p><p>A solar generator consists of a solar panel array and a power station. Both components are important; each can be used alone, but they do best as a team. We won't suggest that it doesn't matter which solar panels you choose, but most people will do well to decide on the power station first. That's what we focused on for this gear guide. Once you choose the right one for you, decide how fast you need the battery topped off when you can't access the grid and find a compatible solar array from that brand.</p><p>There's a lot more to learn before you make this kind of investment, so let's identify some of the best solar generators and make sense of the technology that powers them.</p>",259
116,fixed blade knives,"<p>Fixed blade knives are specialists in the knife world. I don't typically carry one, although I own one. When I was a boot lieutenant in the Marine Corps infantry, I purchased a SOG Desert Dagger, thinking it was a marked improvement over the issued Ka-Bar in puncturing Russian-made body armor. It was well-built out of 440A stainless steel, had a cool double edge with serrations near the handle, and came with a Kydex sheath. Well folks, I never stabbed a Russian with it, and all I used it for was opening MRE boxes and slitting open plastic MRE bags. It weighed almost a pound, so I ditched it for a Spyderco Delica folding knife which served me well for many years. I did dig the SOG Desert Dagger out of retirement and took it along with me when the 1st Marine Division invaded Iraq in 2003. Again, I rarely used it, but it looked fearsome and added a bit of moral support and comfort during those very fluid days on the battlefield in March and April as we were rolling along alone and unafraid investigating ""special incidents"" for the division commander. Fun times.</p><p>While I prefer folding knives, fixed blade knives exist for a reason and many of our readers use them on the job, so our trusty team of gear reviewers wanted to evaluate a half dozen of them and let you know what we think. Here are a handful of fixed blade knives that made the cut - and one you should avoid at all costs.</p>",257
175,cycling gloves,"<p>When I first started cycling about 10 years ago, I never thought about whether there was such a thing as the best cycling gloves. I put no thought into them other than whether they looked cool and if they fit well enough for me to grip the handlebars of my mountain bike. This was fine for short rides, but the longer I rode, the more I noticed my arms were sore and sometimes numb.</p><p>Years later, when I took up road riding, I still didn't put too much thought into gloves - at least, not until I noticed numbness again creeping in as I added miles to my rides. Then, on one birthday, my wife bought me a new pair of gloves, and like magic, the numbness vanished. It turns out that the answer to the question ""how different can gloves be?"" is ""very.""</p><p>If you're new to cycling, or like I was and never really thought about it because all you wanted to do was ride, you might wonder how to choose the best cycling gloves. Don't worry: What follows are some of the best cycling gloves we could find, and we'll tell you why.</p><p>A quick note: Like running shoes, what fits well for one person might not fit another so well. Plus, you may intend to spend all your cycling time in the mud or maybe ride in the winter (you maniac). That's why we're sharing with you the best gloves we could find for different types of cycling. Whatever your niche, we've got you covered.</p>",256
266,running socks,"<p>It's commonly believed that the specific shoe you choose will determine your performance during any strenuous exercise, but don't underestimate the value of running socks. It's true, the shoe plays a huge role in comfort, and we've come a long way from strapping pieces of leather to our feet and calling them sandals, thankfully. But while you're probably aware that there has been a ton of research into running shoe technology, did you know running socks are just as important? Sure, companies haven't figured out a way to sync your sock and fitness tracker yet, but running socks are just as critical as the rest of your fitness gear. The sock acts as a barrier between your foot and the shoe, essentially a foot shield. Overlooking your sock selection could have dire consequences.</p><p>If you've ever gotten a blister while on a run, you know how painful it can be and how socks play a factor. If you don't, well then you're lucky and you'll just have to imagine what it's like having a hot poker rammed into your foot every time it hits the ground. Every step creates friction, and when your shoes and socks aren't right, that friction will create blisters. David Goggins may choose to run on blistered feet, but there's no reason you have to (unless you want to become a Navy SEAL). Instead, you can select a pair of the best running socks so that your feet have a foot shield to protect against blisters and debris.</p>",251

Instead, you can select a pair of the best running socks so that your feet have a foot shield to protect against blisters and debris.</p>",251
96,ballistic glasses,"<p>Ballistic glasses are half of the ""eyes and ears"" equation when it comes to shooting safety. It's important to take them seriously, but sometimes that's easier said than done. In the Marine Corps, my issued eye pro seemed like it was intentionally designed to fog up, scratch, jab me in the temples, and generally make life miserable. I don't have proof that those glasses were designed by the Taliban, but I have my suspicions.</p><p>Because those glasses were terrible, they occasionally developed a bewildering habit of falling right off my face as soon as I reached the firing line. I was always so focused on my shooting that I never noticed those foggy pieces of crap resting on the ground until after I'd successfully completed my string of fire. It wasn't until I deployed that I invested in a pair of my own and realized that ballistic glasses can actually be a real asset if they're actually built well.</p><p>To save you from eye ocular trauma, furious range safety officers, and financial mistakes, we took it upon ourselves to chase down some of the best ballistic glasses out there. Our search was focused on products that meet the U.S. military's MIL-PRF-31013 standard for protective eyewear. Many can be found on the Army's Authorized Protective Eyewear List. All of our picks have our vote of confidence when it comes to keeping your eyes safe, your face comfortable, and your chain of command quietunless someone's asking where they can get a pair like yours.</p>",250
177,ultralight sleeping bags,"<p>If you're like me and hate a heavy backpack, then you probably already know that the heaviest three items are typically the backpack itself, your shelter, and your sleep system, so we're going to focus today's review on shaving ounces and finding the best ultralight sleeping bag for you.</p><p>Ultralight (UL) backpacking is more of a state of mind than a specific definition. It's about taking a serious look at how much every item of your gear weighs and making decisions about whether to take it or replace it with a lighter option. It also involves understanding what you're sacrificing in terms of trade-offs. In order to go fast and light, hard decisions have to be made and frequently you're giving up a bit of comfort, versatility, and/or durability over heavier similar items.</p><p>Any idiot can make a heavy sleeping bag. Sure, it will be warm, but it will also be bulky and weigh a lot. It takes real talent to make sleeping bags light, warm, and compressible or packable. Typically, this is done by making the sleeping bag more form-fitting to the body (less interior volume equals less material equals less weight), using stronger, lighter, and more often less durable materials (10 denier fabrics or lighter), shortening zipper lengths (full to half or one-third), omitting add-ons like interior pockets, and using the very highest quality down (800 power fill or higher).</p><p>So strap in and let's find the best ultralight sleeping bag for you!</p>",242
244,barbells,"<p>Once the realm of strongmen and circuses, the barbell is now an integral piece of any weight room. The big four - bench press, deadlift, squat, and overhead press - are fundamental lifts that rely upon this simple and overlooked tool. When I say overlooked, I mean that there is no singularly more versatile piece of equipment that you could add to your gym. Bands and dumbbells are great for isolation and adding variety to your workouts, but the Preacher Curl has not been added to the Olympics for a reason. Strength is found under the bar, something I learned when I began weightlifting.</p><p>Using a barbell was the one outlet that helped me beat depression. Something about the ritual of blasting rock, chalking up and then exerting all my energy to lift as much weight as I could was invigorating. The most rewarding feeling was the sense of lightheadedness and ringing of the ears after a lift - it meant that you were at your true maximum. Every day that I went to the gym didn't just make my muscles stronger, it made my mind stronger. In many ways, the barbell is the ultimate piece of gym equipment that works your mind, body, and spirit.</p><p>For all of these reasons, you need to choose wisely when investing in a barbell. Here are some of our picks for the best barbells that would make a perfect addition to your home gym.</p>",239

14,ar 15 scopes,"<p>AR-15 scopes are no longer a novelty. The military has used them since before the War on Terror and recreational shooters and hunters have made them a standard part of their rifle build. For modern shooters, the world is their oyster when it comes to optics, given the sheer number of AR rifle scopes on the market. Today, I've gathered our picks for great optics to use on the AR-15 rifle, subdivided into three separate categories: short-range, medium-range, and long-range. </p><p>Before I begin, though, several presumptions informed all my picks for the best AR-15 scopes.Firstly, I'm operating under the presumption that your AR-15 is chambered in 5.56×45 NATO or .223 Remington rather than a more exotic caliber like .300 AAC Blackout or 6.5 Grendel. Secondly, when I refer to the range, I'm referring to the capabilities of the 5.56 cartridge. In this context, short-range traditionally means less than 200 yards, medium-range means 200-400 yards, and long-range is anything over 500 yards (when 5.56 loses supersonic velocity and becomes less precise). Finally, the options in this article were selected with the serious leisure shooter, competitive shooter, and hunter in mind.</p><p>All of the suggestions on this list are based on expert input from competitive shooters, military personnel, and firearms historians, and are popular throughout the shooting world due to their performance, user-friendliness, and value for the price, which means that if the scope costs $2,000, there's a very good reason.</p>",238
72,spotting scope tripods,"<p>Consistently placing accurate shots on targets beyond 500 yards requires determination, discipline, teamwork, solid training, and of course, the proper equipment - including spotting scope tripods. Anyone who's attended an NRA F-class match has likely seen a bewildering array of high-speed low-drag gear ranging from Gucci rifles in exotic calibers to eye-wateringly clear (and expensive!) optics, portable weather stations, ballistic calculators, and more from vendors eager to sell you its latest products. Some of this equipment is necessary, others yield diminishing returns; however, one product that is frequently left out of the spotlight is the mundane, yet essential, spotting scope tripod.</p><p>Like any other activity, a solid foundation is essential - be that an understanding of ballistic fundamentals or, in this case, the stability of the spotting scope. Whether for competition or more serious work, the spotter controls the engagement and directs the shooter with corrections for distance and wind. To do this, the spotting scope needs to be rock steady so that the spotter can (1) locate, identify, and, if necessary, range targets, (2) estimate wind at the target location, and (3) communicate corrections to the shooter based on bullet trace and point of impact. Mounting a $3,000 spotting scope atop a $50 photography tripod simply will not do.<br/><br/>To that end, we put together a guide to the best spotting scope tripods on the market. Take a gander and see which spotting scope tripod fits your needs best.</p>",238
105,weighted vests,"<p>A weighted vest could be exactly what you need to keep up with your fitness goals. Adding a weighted vest to certain workout routines is a way to find new challenges and find new ways to keep the flame burning. Sick of the gym? The hell with the gym. I do most of my workouts in my basement or my garage. Don't have gym equipment at home? Screw gym equipment. Most of my workouts are functional, bodyweight workouts. Push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, dips, runs, etc. With fitness, the only barrier to entry is your brain and your will.</p><p>But what happens when your body weight is no longer enough resistance? What happens when your personal organic mass is too easy to lift or you find yourself doing a zillion reps just to get tired. Take it easy, Billy-Badass, I have a solution. Increase your body weight. And no, I don't mean to start hammering pizza and Oreos. I mean get yourself a weighted vest.</p><p>A weighted vest is a great way to up the ante on your bodyweight workouts, ranging from regular runs to elaborate Crossfit workouts. But like most workout gear, there are a hundred different variations of the same general concept and it can be difficult to determine which weighted vest would be conducive to your own personal goals. In this article, we'll break down our top choices and, hopefully, get you into your very own Thundershirt Of Destiny.</p>",238
121,plasma lighters,"<p>Plasma lighters are just the latest in a long line of tools that make fire possible. At first, there were (I imagine) cavemen sitting around a fire they built with a bow drill, remarking at how lazy their neighbor was for waiting for lightning to strike and create fire for him. Then came people with flint and steel who just couldn't be bothered to toil away with a bow drill - and so the progression went.</p><p>For a long time, it was hard to imagine anything easier than flicking a lighter open and having instant flame. Getting excessive flame with a little modification was a mandatory skill for any aspiring pyromaniac. The problem is that old-school lighters are a lot less economical than you think. Sure, disposable Bic lighters are only a few bucks, but they don't last very long and they generate a lot of waste for what you get out of them. Even refillable lighters burn through fuel faster than we'd like.</p><p>Enter plasma lighters. These handy devices are a modern twist on old technology; if you've ever function-checked a spark plug, you've basically seen the concept in action. Plasma lighters are rechargeable, easy to use, and don't involve any nasty chemicals. They're rugged enough for the great outdoors and civilized enough to use in your home. They're also very entertaining, so we won't blame you if you haven't totally aged out of your inner pyro just yet.</p>",238
234,paracords,"<p>The best paracords are the ones you know how to use effectively in the field. It's a good idea to practice with the cheap stuff and maybe have a few feet available for basic tasks, but I recommend having something more capable in your camping pack or go-bag. By the time you reach the comments section (where I encourage you to leave a few tips and tricks of your own), you'll have the know-how to buy the best paracords for your needs and the resources to build your skills with them.</p><p>I realize that most paracord will be braided into a keychain or wrap, never to be touched again. Some will be used to suspend a poncho liner as a makeshift shelter in the field because tents, we all know, are for the weak. Any old discount paracord you find online will work for those jobs, but if you ever actually need paracord in a life-or-death situation, you're going to want mil-spec 550 or 750 cord that can bear a sizable load and be broken down into many usable components.</p><p>The best paracords for survival have bonus features like tinder, fishing line, and metal filament woven into the internal strands. This style of survival paracord can turn your bootlaces or knife handle into a miniature survival kit in a matter of seconds. Of course, that's only if you took the time to learn applicable bushcraft skills before the time comes.</p>",238

83,solar panels for camping,"<p>The best solar panel and a wind turbine are talking about music. So the wind turbine turns to the solar panel and says, ""So, what bands are you into, bro?"" The solar panel says, ""Whatever's hot, but I prefer the light stuff. How about you?"" The wind turbine replies, ""Me, hell, I'm a big metal fan!"" Get it? Metal…fan. Ok, ok. I know that was awful, but whether you are camping in the front country or the backcountry, solar panels are a great way to keep all your devices powered - especially the ones you use to rock out. You'll also need power for your GPS, personal locator beacon, avalanche transceivers, smart watches, phones, cameras, and all the other electronic junk we haul around.</p><p>Keeping stuff powered while camping is always a challenge, especially on multi-day backpacking trips. It's super inconvenient (and noisy) to bring a generator car camping, and it's totally unfeasible while backpacking. Batteries are also heavy to pack around, and you're not going to spool out a 35-mile extension cord. So, what do you do? Consider taking along a small, portable solar panel. It's the best option for off-the-grid power for long trips where your power needs can't be met by a portable rechargeable battery. I've been impressed lately at the improvements in weight-to-power-generated ratios from many products. Like all things technological, it's exciting to see portable solar panels get smaller, lighter, and less expensive.</p>",237
241,down jackets,"<p>Whenever I head out into the backcountry, I dress in layers and bring a down jacket with me - every time, even in the summer. ""Why?"" you might ask. If you've spent any time in the military, you probably heard the old saying that cold kills. Well, that's only half of it.</p><p>The truth is that it's cold, plus moisture will set you speeding down the icy luge run to the great hereafter. When you expend energy while moving, your body creates heat. If that heat can't escape, it builds up moisture in your clothing. When you stop moving, you stop generating heat, and that built-up moisture transfers the cold directly to your skin.</p><p>With that said, it's important to get smart about layering and also selecting appropriate insulating layers so you can regulate both your body temperature and the moisture within your clothing. I generally start with a thin base layer like a Patagonia Capilene Cool lightweight shirt, add an R1 Air Full-Zip hoody for when I'm moving, and keep a down parka at the top of my pack to wear at breaks to stay warm.</p><p>Down, which comes from pumules from ducks and geese, is nature's best insulator. Down offers the most warmth for the least weight and bulk. It's super warm, light, and compressible. I've taken a look at the best down jackets to help you decide which is the best jacket that meets your needs.</p>",236
18,chest rigs,"<p>Chest rigs are the next evolution of load-bearing equipment that enables you to become the fast-moving lethal warrior you've trained to become. Most military veterans are familiar with load-bearing vests (LBVs), which were utilized as recently as the 1990s during the Gulf War. These systems were often uncomfortable, had limited customization and modularity options, and since they were designed to fit over bulky body armor, they were hard to fit properly without it. These older designs have evolved into a more versatile option that can be fully customized and work with or without body armor, which we call chest rigs.</p><p>While chest rigs offer less protection than plate carriers, they do offer more mobility and weigh less. These attributes can come in handy for various missions, but an added bonus is the ability to pack or store your body armor while still carrying ammo and gear. Those of us who had chest rigs would utilize this option during large unit hikes as we would be required to pack our body armor. Wearing our chest rigs would save space in the pack, even out the weight, and keep us ready for anything. To this day, I keep a chest rig in my go bag exactly for that reason.</p><p>So which chest rig is best for you? Let's take a look at some of the best chest rigs on the market and help you find a worthy selection.</p>",234
44,night vision goggles,"<p>The first time I got issued night vision in the Marine Corps, I felt like a true badass. With my trusty NVG and motivated M249, I would own the night harder than the grim reaper with insomnia. That magical little PVS-14 would unlock the darkness like a video game cheat code and leave the enemy nowhere to hide.</p><p>Except none of those things turned out to be true. My first training evolution was to simply walk a marked path through the woods, and even that proved damn near impossible. I kept tripping over roots, gouging my face on branches, and waving my arms in front of me like a cartoon mummy.</p><p>If you're new to night vision, you should expect a similar learning curve. In addition to the challenges I faced, you'll have to come up with a four-figure stack of dollar bills to fund the experience. But, like those before you, you'll get the hang of it. Call it what you want - night vision, NVG, or NODS - being able to see in the dark is a total game-changer.</p><p>We know a thing or two about working with night vision and we enlisted the help of some of the industry's best to make sure you not only know what products are available, but also what kind of information should guide your buying decision, and how to get the most out of your investment.</p>",232
65,thermal scopes,"<p>Hollywood would have you believe that thermal scopes impart superhuman vision to anyone who possesses one, leaving you vulnerable only to Austrian bodybuilders covered in mud. The crazy thing is that, unlike giant fireballs from grenades or magazines that never run out of ammunition, thermal scopes are actually crazier in real life than they seem in the movies.</p><p>Don't fall into the trap of thinking that thermal optics are the less-useful little cousin to night vision. The two are more different than alike, and thermal technology can offer a tremendous tactical advantage. For starters, they're just as effective during daylight as they are after dark. Digital internals can allow displays to include compass readings, distance as measured by a laser rangefinder, and heat images custom-tailored to your needs. Some can even tag targets and share them across other devices.</p><p>Thermal scopes have proven their worth in the military for decades. Law enforcement officers use them for everything from search and rescue operations to engagements with hostile suspects. Hunters use them to get an edge in pursuit of predator species and invasive hogs. Whatever your purpose is, prepare to have your mind blown by how valuable thermal imaging can be. There's a lot to learn before you invest in a thermal scope of your own, so allow us to recommend a few of our favorites and provide some background information for context.</p>",229
17,rangefinders for hunting,"<p>The ideal rangefinders for hunting aren't always the most expensive rangefinders, as one might expect. ""Hunting"" is a rather ambiguous term, the practice of which can vary widely depending on a hunter's chosen game, geographical location, and tool of choice (rifle, bow, bazooka, etc). There's a wide variety of hunting rangefinders on the market, with an even wider array of capabilities, and it's important to understand which functions you will need for your specific style of hunting. Understanding this could be the difference between spending $100 on a hunting rangefinder and dropping $500 or more.</p><p>Not to get preachy or anything, but to me, ethical hunting is something all hunters should strive to practice. For those unfamiliar with the term, ethical hunting simply means that the hunter strives to harvest their quarry in the quickest and most efficient way possible, causing the least amount of pain for their prey. In this day and age, and especially for those of us not blessed with the wisdom of age and extensive experience, technology like hunting rangefinders can aid a hunter in taking high probability, ethical shots that will kill animals quickly and minimize the risk of merely wounding the animal, leading to undue suffering.</p><p>In the sections below, we will explore our picks for the best rangefinders for hunting, their key attributes, downfalls, and what type of hunting they suit best.</p>",227
278,resistance bands,"<p>If your gym bag isn't equipped with a set of resistance bands, you should probably fix that sooner than later. The stretchy fitness accessory seems too simple and inexpensive to make a difference, but looks can be deceiving.</p><p>In early 2020, I was lucky enough to work out at one of the best gyms I've ever seen. It had rows of squat racks, two monolifts, about a dozen deadlift platforms, endless dumbbells, and strongman equipment most people have never even heard of. There were separate rooms full of strength training and cardio equipment. And the speakers played heavy metal nonstop. Then lockdowns hit.</p><p>I found myself working out at home with dumbbells up to 25 pounds, a few resistance bands, and an endlessly patient wife who let me fireman-carry her on leg day. That period of time made me a big believer in resistance bands. A few glorified rubber bands allowed me to train every muscle group and stay in shape until the gyms reopened. Now, they've earned a spot in my active recovery routine and travel with me when I need to stay fit on the road.</p><p>Understanding resistance bands is easy, but there are some key basics you need to know. That's why we did the leg work for you, and the result is a shortlist of recommendations that can have an oversized impact on your fitness.</p>",226
304,trail running shoes,"<p>Let's face it: For many of us, running is a necessary evil. For the military folks, PT isn't an option (except for maybe Space Force), and a lot of vets continue PT out of a lifetime of habit. Some folks like to run, some outright despise it. So if you've got to do it, why not make it interesting?</p><p>Trail running can make this tedious exercise enjoyable and rewarding. If you're miserable while running, you can distract yourself by focusing on the technical challenges around you, or just enjoy the scenery. While you can tackle tame trails with regular running shoes, you're going to want to have specifically-made trail runners if you're thinking of racing over more challenging terrain. Since the technical paths are where the fun is, we've put together this list to help you choose the best trail runners to help you take your fitness to the next level.</p><p>We've got a list of some of the best trail running shoes on the market, and why you should take a look at them.

162,cycling shoes,"<p>When I first started cycling, one of my first questions was, ""Will I die if I wear those shoes?"" My second question was, ""What's up with those shorts?"" - but I suppose this guide isn't about that. But those shoes. I was fascinated as I watched my wife, a cyclist of many years, lock her feet into pedals, and wondered how she didn't break a bone whenever the rare but inevitable crash occurred. I mean, you have to twist your ankle to click out, and I wondered whether I would have the presence of mind to perform this task in time to prevent an injury if I crashed.</p><p>It turns out, as I discovered much later than I should have, cycling shoes aren't nearly as complicated as they look. With just a little practice, they become second nature. But more importantly, they transformed my cycling experience. I found my speed and efficiency improved significantly, and I didn't have to fight so hard to keep up with my wife.</p><p>There's a lot of brands out there to choose from though, and even if you've been riding a while, it's sometimes hard to figure out what shoes are worth your time. So we've done the research for you to help you find the perfect shoes to help you up your game and blow past your personal records.</p>",223
195,battle ropes,"<p>Battle ropes are growing in popularity, and you might be wondering if you should add one to your home gym. Are battle ropes worth it? They're not a magic answer to all your fitness woes; nothing is. But battle ropes can be a good way to mix up your cardio and strength training with a high-intensity exercise that's engaging and fun. That's something we can all benefit from.</p><p>Battle ropes (also called workout ropes or exercise ropes) are very versatile and can be used for strength and conditioning with a range of compound movements. They can help you improve your cardiovascular fitness with high-intensity training that's more efficient (and more fun) than slogging through another run around the neighborhood. With a little creativity, you can even use them to train your lower body with various drags and pulls.</p><p>Alongside other gym staples like power racks, weight benches, barbells, and resistance bands, the best battle ropes can help put everything you need to achieve peak physical performance in your own home. We chased down some of the very best premium, value, and homemade battle ropes out there so you can stop shopping and start working out. We also rounded up the information you need to understand how to use battle ropes, make an informed decision, and make the best use of your new workout ropes.</p>",222

Regardless of how often you run, it's important to find a running shoe that is light enough not to weigh you down but has enough marshmallowy goodness in the midsole to absorb the shock of your feet pounding the pavement, stride after stride, so your knees and hips don't have to.</p><p>Despite the importance of good running shoes, it can prove extremely difficult to sort the wheat from the chaff when it comes to choosing the right ones; indeed, it can often seem intimidating to test out shoes in a running specialty store. With so many conflicting opinions about what constitutes a ""good"" shoe for the average runner, finding the right fit at a reasonable price point can feel all but impossible.</p><p>Never fear: Whether you are a seasoned ultra-marathoner or if you only run when being chased by a wild animal, we have you covered. We've tested out five of the top neutral, high-cushion women's running shoes on the market to help you feel good mile after mile. Here's what our testing revealed.</p>",216
71,hunting knives,"<p>When we sat down to start planning our survey of the best hunting knives, it felt like a time to swing big. It seemed like the perfect opportunity to look beyond the usual suspects, dig a little deeper, and find the very best - and most interesting - hunting knives from around the world. We didn't just want knives that work; we wanted knives that you'll be excited to see every time you pull one out of the sheath.</p><p>To that end, we tracked down knives from six countries on three continents, from bushcraft blades to precision instruments. We spent hours comparing and contrasting various steel alloys, handle materials, blade shapes, and edge grinds. Then, to be absolutely sure that each of these knives was up to the task of serving as your go-to hunting blade, we handed them all over to the pros at Outdoor Addiction Meat Processing in beautiful Blue Mounds, Wisconsin, to see how they stacked up in the eyes of people who turn animals into delicious meat for a living.</p><p>The result is one of the most thorough gear roundups we've ever done, and it's one hell of a resource in the search for your new favorite knife out of the best hunting knives out there. Let's cut to the chase, shall we?</p>",215
228,camping chairs,"<p>Any camping trip can become a potentially miserable experience without an appropriate camping chair. Sure, camping today is more a ritualistic reminder of the primitive roots we all share, but while it may be a ""primitive"" experience, we no longer have to utilize the primitive tools and equipment our ancestors did. If you're looking for a useful camping accessory for your next outdoor adventure, consider a camping chair to bring comfort to your campsite.</p><p>Those who have been in the military are intimately familiar with camping, especially the infantry since that's half of the job description. In my unit, several of us had purchased little three-post camping stools to take into the field. One day, I got the bright idea to use my stool as an improvised seven-ton seat, and within a matter of minutes, the stool's legs gave out and we all had a good laugh at my expense. Like you, I had no clue back then what to look for in the best camping chairs and I've learned my lessons the hard way.</p><p>There is a major difference between cheap, generic-brand chairs and the best camping chairs that cost a little more, which is what we'll explore here. Listen up, because these chairs could save your hiney during your next excursion into the great outdoors.</p>",215
24,hatchets for camping,"<p>When I was a kid, I had to read a book called Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. The book follows the exploits of a young boy named Brian who, following a plane crash, manages to survive alone in the Canadian wilderness thanks in large part to his trusty hatchet and the bushcraft skills he develops along the way. It's a great read for kids who love the outdoors that was inspired by the author's life, which is somehow even more incredible than the book's plot.</p><p>Besides being a fantastic read that even my fellow crayon-eating Marines can easily digest, you should also take a lesson from the main character and think about the tools you have at your disposal. Even if you aren't dropped into the wild unknown all by your lonesome, being able to fend for yourself can make life a lot easier (and more rewarding). And sometimes, that tool is little more than a hatchet designed to conquer the great outdoors.</p><p>In the spirit of young Brian and his tale of survival, we've put together a guide to help you select the perfect hatchet for your next outdoor adventure. It doesn't matter if you need a hardcore tactical hatchet or something that Ron Swanson would be proud of, we've got you covered.</p>",211
180,field jackets,"<p>Few things can surpass the peace of mind that comes with going into the outdoors knowing you have a reliable field jacket.</p><p>Originally adopted by the U.S. military in (unsurprisingly) 1965, the M-65 field jacket gained renown and popularity during the Vietnam War, where it was standard issue for service members deployed to Southeast Asia. The impact of the war was viscerally represented to American society by soldiers returning home still clinging to the jacket that protected them from the many elements overseas. Worn by veterans, Rambo, and so many others, the field jacket became an iconic representation of the U.S. military during that chapter of American history, and its cultural footprint remains to this day.</p><p>What makes a good field jacket? By historical precedent, a field jacket is a durable, rugged coat that's loaded with pocket space, all while keeping out most inclement weather. However, in an industry flooded with reproductions, knockoffs, and emulations, not all jackets are created equal. That's why we've taken the time here to provide you with a list of some of the best options out there to keep the elements off your back and help you narrow the field down to a few winners so you can buy with confidence. Let's get to it, shall we?</p>",210
2,karambit knives,"<p>""Taken,"" ""Burn Notice,"" and ""Die Hard With a Vengeance"" all have one blade in common: the karambit. Originating in 11th century Indonesia, it was purportedly designed to mimic a tiger's claw, though it was most commonly used as a general-purpose utility knife originally. It was soon recognized for its martial value, however, and saw extensive combat use throughout Southeast Asia.</p><p>Karambits may vary in size, but they do share some common features: They have a hawkbill-shaped blade, typically with a very acute tip, and the majority have a finger ring on the pommel. The ring allows for a more secure and consistent draw and helps lock your grip in place, even in extreme environments. This makes it especially useful for those in wet environments, rock-climbers, and first responders as an EDC knife. The needle-like tip allows for pinpoint accuracy and easy penetration, while the recurved blade pulls the material in, utilizing the entire edge without the blade being able to slip out.</p><p>While it might be a staple of mall-ninjas everywhere, the karambit has undeniable functionality, both for utility and self-defense. It's used in quite a few martial arts, including Silat, Kali, Arnis, Eskrima, Bersilat, and Kuntao. Read on for our list of the best karambit knives on the market.</p>",208
62,bug out bags,"<p>A well-stocked bug out bag is an absolute must-have for anyone preparing for the uncertainties of life. The life-saving gear packed away into a bug out bag provides enough food, water, medicine, and other life essentials for a 72-hour trek to a safe location in unpredictable conditions. The best bug out bags have plenty of space for shelf-safe foodstuffs, water, an advanced first aid kit, fire starters, shelter equipment, and navigation gear. They feature plenty of pouches, pockets, and cavities for all your gear (and then some) and are rugged enough to withstand abrasions, poor weather conditions, and any other abuse life can throw at them. In short, a bug out bag is your insurance policy against short-term emergencies that require you to be mobile and flexible. The next time a hurricane strikes, grab your bag and bug out to a safe location without a second thought about the bare necessities.</p><p>Of course, selecting a bug out bag is one thing: building the ultimate bug out bag is another thing entirely. Consider taking the time to read this handy guide to packing everything you need for a solid bug out bag and nothing you don't. Trust us: the next time you're in an emergency, you'll be glad you did.</p>",208
256,coolers for camping,"<p>A solid cooler for camping can make a major difference. That idea cemented in my mind after I watched a video series about guys who took their overlanding Toyota Tacomas 500 miles across the desert without using paved roads, hotels, or restaurants. They just started driving with about a week's worth of fuel and supplies. Imagine my surprise when they kicked off the first night with grilled steak and fresh vegetables washed down with cold beer.</p><p>I reflected on my own camping menu of Clif bars and jerky. A package of Ramen cooked over my Jetboil is the closest I get to a real meal in the woods. Camping can sure mean different things to different people. As I watched their steak sizzle on screen, I couldn't help but think that I was making life way harder than it has to be.</p><p>The difference-makeraside from motor vehiclesis a camping cooler. The only way to enjoy a fresh meal at your campsite is to keep your provisions cold until it's time to cook. There are a few ways to do that, depending on your style of camping, but we set out to find a camping cooler for everyone. Let this gear guide be your first step toward living the good life.</p>",208
42,mag pouches for plate carriers,"<p>Selecting the best magazine pouches for your plate carrier can be like finding a needle in a stack of needles. In 2007, I bought my first MOLLE-capable mag pouches to upgrade my standard-issue kit without knowing what I was doing. I quickly learned to tailor my gear to the mission. After all, MOLLE allows for complete adaptability, so you just have to use a little foresight.</p><p>A breacher will need gear to accommodate shotshells, but the guy with a pistol needs secondary mag pouches. The recon team operating in the jungle will need camouflage gear, but the assault team working in the desert might want coyote brown. What you're doing and where you'll be doing it determine what you'll need, and it's vital to have the right setup and gear on your kit before stepping past the line of departure.</p><p>If you've read our review of the best magazine pouches overall, then you're probably wondering why this article exists. Well, many feature MOLLE attachments that are great for plate carriers, but some are intended specifically for or have a general design that wouldn't be ideal for use with armor. Let's take a look at the best mag pouches for your plate carrier and how they'll maximize your combat effectiveness.</p>",207
245,personal locator beacons,"<p>One of the joys of backcountry travel is getting far away from idiots, and the further you go away from civilization, the more you need to be prepared to rescue yourself - which is why personal locator beacons (PLBs) are so important.</p><p>I frequently hit the backcountry for days and travel to some pretty remote areas, places where cell phone coverage is sketchy to non-existent and we might see a few people per day, maybe. There are a lot of objective hazards in the wild, everything from heat exhaustion to hypothermia, lightning strikes to avalanches to venomous snake bites, and more. But without risk, there's no adventure.</p><p>However, we should always take steps to mitigate risk, and part of that is having a communication and rescue plan. With so many devices out there, it's hard to know what product is best for you, and personal locator beacons have come a long way from the early days of push and pray (that it works and someone responds).</p><p>To that end, your trusty writers here have sifted through what's available to recommend to you the very best personal locator beacons for your next outdoor adventure. Read on, and remember: when things go wrong, you'll be happy you left home prepared.</p>",205
192,hiking boots,"<p>Hiking boots and I have a bit of a love-hate relationship. In the Marine Corps, I logged more miles in jungle boots and moon boots than I can keep track of (and maybe one or two ill-advised humps in the woefully unsupportive Bates Lites). I'm sure you can relate, and I'm happy to report that there are much better ways to hoof it from A to B.</p><p>Our review team tests all kinds of gear, and we have some accomplished hikers among us. I'm talking about people that hike the highest peaks, hottest deserts, and longest trails. The boots we've tested span from bargain-basement to top-of-the-line. Rather than leaving you to navigate all those gear guides on your own, we compiled a list of our favorites to save time and get you on the trail as soon as possible. There are some shoes and boots that we liked, but didn't think would be a good choice for your dedicated hiking boot. We also have favorite packs, camping gear, and more knives than you can shake a freshly whittled stick at. All that can be found in our gear section.</p><p>As for the best hiking boots for your next overland excursion, here are our favorites.</p>",202

21,go bags,"<p>Go bags are finally getting some mainstream attention, and we couldn't be happier about it. After all, having all of your essentials in one place, ready to go, is one of the most important steps toward emergency preparedness.</p><p>Don't believe us? Just reference some of our favorite movie scenes. It seems like every spy eventually opens a safety deposit box to find passports, cash, and a pistol. My thoughts on The Patriot are well-documented, and the movie even features a 1776-style go bag. Remember when Mel Gibson's character runs into his burning house to retrieve a box of gear? It sure was a good thing all that stuff was organized and ready to go.</p><p>You may not have to worry about global super-villains or marauding British cavalry, but there are plenty of other reasons to have a bag of essentials ready to go at a moment's notice. By the time a natural disaster or civil unrest reaches your doorstep, it's too late to start thinking about what you need to grab on the way out the back door. To that end, we selected some of the best go bags to get you home or survive on the go for various amounts of time.</p>",201
211,pull up bars,"<p>Obviously, the best pull-up bar is the one on base. It's the one that's way too tall, gives you splinters when you touch the posts, and burns your hands if you touch the bare metal bar. To prevent that, we wrap cheap athletic tape around the bar and don't replace it nearly enough. It's stained with sweat, blood, and whatever comes out of blisters when they pop. That's our heritage; that's how the military tradition is passed from one person to another.</p><p>That's not the only pull-up bar, though. I'm willing to bet that what you're looking for is the best pull-up bar for home workouts; one that doesn't require you to hit the gym or find a local park. In that case, I took the liberty of researching some of the brands to choose from and the various ways you can attach a pull-up bar so it can support your weight without causing damage to your home.</p><p>By the end of this buying guide, you'll have the information you need to make an informed decision and pick the best pull-up bar for you. You'll be on the path to daily pull-up workouts and triumphant fitness tests. Let's not waste any time, then.</p>",201
246,running shorts for men,"<p>The new year is upon us, and if getting back in shape is one of your New Year's resolutions, you'll want great running shorts to make that happen. The days of just throwing on a pair of cheap shorts and lacing up your sneakers for a run are behind us. Serious runners need serious shorts. Most people understand the importance of getting the right shoes to be successful as a runner, but how many runners sell themselves short when it comes to their…uh, shorts.</p><p>Sportswear companies have taken full advantage of the latest fabrics and designs to maximize the functionality and comfort of running shorts. Even small considerations like secure pockets for mobile phones, keys, and energy gel packs have become considerations in selecting the best running shorts.</p><p>Like shoes, there are few one-size-fits-all choices in running shorts today. There are shorts designed for sprinters, for cold weather, for those who prefer longer shorts or more minimalist shorts, and for those who want shorts they can wear on the track or in the gym. This guide is intended to help you find your way through the different varieties of choices there are to make the best selection for your athletic and budgeting needs.</p>",201

173,headlamps for hunting,"<p>It's easy to get tunnel vision on rifles, binoculars, and UTVs, but don't forget that the best headlamps for hunting can make your favorite hobby significantly more enjoyable. We saved you the trouble of searching through endless products by picking the best headlamps available for this gear guide.</p><p>Most hunting begins with a dark walk through trees and underbrush. Don't get me wrong - I like tripping over roots and stubbing my toes on rocks as much as anybody - but using a flashlight can certainly get you to the stand or blind in one piece more often than your natural night vision can. Keeping your hands free has obvious advantages of your own. By using a headlamp, you'll always have light where you need it and still be able to carry and move whatever you want.</p><p>A lot of gear guides will phone it in with a list of the first headlamps the writer found in some kind of camouflage pattern. Camo is cool, but there are other things that make a great headlamp for hunting. That's where I focused my attention, and the result is a list of solid gear that can walk the walk, not just talk the talk.</p>",200
225,cycling sunglasses,"<p>During the first year or two after I started cycling, if you had asked me ""what's the best cycling sunglasses out there,"" I would have answered with a flat ""the cheapest that will stay on your face."" In hindsight, that is bad advice. Frugal, yes, but bad.</p><p>I know better now, especially after my cavalier attitude led to me catching a bug just below one eye that actually gave me a black eye for a week. My wife gave me a pair of her glasses, which although not a premium brand, were a lot better than the cheap, not-even-cycling style glasses I had been wearing. I couldn't believe the difference. Not only could I see better, but the wind no longer dried my eyes out and the bugs just bounced off. I was converted.</p><p>Picking the right glasses will not only make your ride more enjoyable in the sun and wind, they can also protect your eyes from damage in the event of a crash (or a collision with an unfortunate bug). If you're new to cycling, I hope to spare you the hard lessons I learned. This guide lays out some of the best options out there for your cycling needs.</p>",200
277,weight benches,"<p>There is no way that you've been to a gym without seeing a weight bench, let alone used one. Even Planet Fitness has weight benches from what I hear (I've never personally stepped inside of one). If you don't regularly incorporate one into your workout, you're missing out on some great benefits, some of which I wasn't even aware of when I was younger.</p><p>In high school, I worked out using barbells and cable machines. I didn't get serious workouts with a weight bench until I joined the military. So I remember quite vividly my first chest workout after a four-hour vehicle patrol in the middle of the night. A more senior Marine and I did almost every variation of chest presses we could with dumbbells. I was sore for days.</p><p>A weight bench is integral to weightlifting workouts and bodybuilding routines because they allow you to put different stresses on the muscles. Essentially, they allow you to manipulate gravity to increase your gains. Bruh. We're talking about game-changing variations that can help you build muscle or burn fat. But how do you know which one to buy for your home gym? Let's take a look at how these benches stack up.</p>",200

107,rooftop cargo carriers,"<p>Packing everything needed for a road trip or excursion can be simpler with a rooftop cargo carrier. We've all seen those cars cruising around with funky-shaped boxes on the roof, and if you're in the Pacific Northwest, they probably have more virtue signaling stickers than the bumper. They may seem goofy, but they are a great option for stowing cargo without taking up cabin and trunk space. This makes them ideal for sedans, wagons, and small SUVs when you need cabin space for passengers. The last thing you want to do is cram into your Subie for two hours to go adventuring because that means you have to cram in on the way back and that will cause major cramping.</p><p>Not everyone needs a giant SUV capable of carrying 12 people or a truck that can tow a mountain, but that doesn't mean you have to miss out on the ability to pack gear. Rooftop cargo carriers are an excellent alternative. Most are waterproof and lockable to keep your belongings protected. They're able to be removed when not in use, but even some are stylish. Let's take an in-depth look at how selecting one of these could be a game-changer.</p>",199
186,power racks,"<p>After college and before reporting to The Basic School as a Marine, I found myself in need of a gym - more specifically, one with a power rack and a lenient chalk policy. Imagine my joy when one of my buddies told me he had a rack in his garage I could use.</p><p>Victor and his roommate both had to park outside, but their garage was a weightlifting paradise, and I swear I heard angels the first time the garage door opened to reveal what was inside. A nearby gym had recently gone out of business and he scooped up a power rack, a bench, a large selection of dumbbells, and more 45-pound plates than I would ever need. Oh, and of course, a big old pair of speakers.</p><p>If your time has come, you're one of the lucky ones and there are tons of great options for the best power racks out there. You can have a full rack, half rack, or squat stand. Get one that folds flat against the wall if you're short on space. Go wild and enjoy never paying membership dues again - and if you're feeling generous, throw an invitation my way, will you?</p>",198
251,backpacking sleeping bags,"<p>The Marine Corps Infantry Officer Course has a saying, ""fight light, freeze at night,"" which, put another way, means leave anything that could possibly keep you warm behind - especially bulky things like sleeping bags. This is a dumb philosophy and makes for some really unpleasantly cold nights in the field that leave you poorly rested for the next day. It's also an excuse for a military force that insists on purchasing overdesigned, heavy, requirements-bound gear when the commercial sector already did all the headwork and has better solutions.You can do better during your next camping trip by investing in one of the best backpacking sleeping bags out there.</p><p>After 20 years in the Marine Corps, I believe wholeheartedly in carrying as little weight in my pack as possible, but with so many excellent commercial off-the-shelf sleeping bags on the market, there's really no reason to not take one along on your next overnight outdoor excursion.

318,rowing machines,"<p>Love high-quality cardio, but hate running? Can't run because of an injury or medical condition? The rowing machine might just be the right exercise solution for you.</p><p>Rowing, sometimes called ""crewing,"" has been around as a sport since the 17th century, when proper Englishmen competed along the River Thames. A century later, Oxford and Cambridge started rowing teams and added to the pantheon of competitive sports and events students from the two prestigious schools engaged in to prove their school's superiority. The rower, or rowing machine, was developed as a means of replicating the movement dynamics, speed, pace, and strength necessary to be a successful rower. The rower has recently gained a great deal of popularity in America, possibly due to the increased interest in low-impact workouts and likely due to its ubiquitous presence in functional fitness gyms.</p><p>Rowing machines offer a number of benefits: They provide the user with high-quality, low-impact cardio that engages up to 86 percent of muscles when done correctly.

351,noise canceling headphones,"<p>If you still haven't made the switch to noise-canceling headphones, I assure you the investment is well worth it. They're a total game-changer and there are several reasons you owe it to yourself to get a pair of your own.</p><p>Imagine that you've finally saved up money to buy an overpriced plane ticket and enough leave to fly home. Now, all that's between you and a relaxing vacation is a pair of three-hour flights, a one-hour layover, and - don't forget - you need to be at the airport two hours early. That's a lot of time to listen to people complain about the airplane not being at the right temperature or conduct hostage negotiations with their kids about which terrible airport food they're going to eat.</p><p>Or maybe you've got some downtime in the barracks. You'd like to kick back with a movie or do some gaming with your friends, but your poor speakers can't keep up with the rowdy neighbors on the other side of paper-thin barracks walls.

Now, while penning a letter home may not carry the same weight as a messenger dashing through the battlefield to relay a note, having a quality pen for writing is still essential. The truth is that you never know when you'll need to relay a message. From covert intelligence to remembering to buy milk on your next run to the market, a pen is a versatile instrument with endless uses (without even calling on your inner MacGyver). But, to get this value, the pen has to work properly, which means the ink can't freeze behind the ball but it also shouldn't flow onto the page in a fountain of ink. You'd be surprised how often a shoddy pen can hinder an op, and it's easier to plan ahead than be caught off guard by a sudden mess.</p><p>Finding the best pens for writing takes a surprising amount of research; so, to cut through the noise, we tracked down the top options. This way, next time you need to relay a message, finding a pen won't be an issue.</p>",197

101,hiking pants for women,"<p>When Southern Maryland was hit by a freak January storm that dumped over a foot of cement-like wet snow, it was worth it to have a pair of the best hiking pants for women on hand to clean up all of the tree limbs that fell on our property. Despite the bitter cold, all I had to do was wear a base layer under my hiking pants (the same ones I wore to climb Mount Rainier) and pull on some gloves, a soft shell jacket, and the North Face Shellista IV tall snow boots I previously reviewed and I was good to go for several hours of intensive restoration work in the wet snow.</p><p>The fact is that, despite their moniker, a good pair of wind- and water-resistant hiking pants can be used for many more purposes than walking in the woods, making them a worthy and versatile addition to your outdoor clothing wardrobe. Worried about the work required to find a good pair? Never fear: We've done the research on the best hiking pants for women that don't sacrifice form for function, so you can stay warm, dry, and look good on all of your adventures.</p>",196
176,home gyms,"<p>Want to work out but aren't a fan of boutique gyms that charge you the GDP of a small country each month and expect you to PR every single class? Maybe you want to be able to just roll out of bed and pound out a few quick sets before starting the day. Maybe you don't feel like sharing smarmy equipment with people who just sit there posting selfies to their social media in between sets. Whatever your reason for wanting to invest in a home gym, we've got your back.</p><p>There are so many different set-ups to choose from when it comes to home gyms on the market. In fact, deciding on the ideal one can be somewhat daunting. The home gym that's ideal for your brother might not be the best one for you, depending on what your primary goals are for owning one in the first place. Not to worry, the crack team here have done the heavy lifting (get it?) for you and has come up with a diverse list of some of the best home gyms on the market. We'll have you lifting things up and putting them down in no time.</p>",196
308,camping food,"<p>The best camping food will do more than fuel your body during backcountry adventures. It'll be food that you actually want to eat. If you've seen the film Meru about mountaineers Conrad Anker, Jimmy Chin, and Renan Ozturk's successful summit of the 21,000-foot mountain via the Shark's Fin Route, you'd have noticed that their entire diet while on the wall seemed to consist of couscous, extra-large Snicker bars, parmesan cheese chunks, and cigarettes. While Anker and company made those decisions purely based on caloric intake and simplicity, you have more options - far more - to fuel your treks.</p><p>If you are car camping, have a decent cooler, camping stove, and weight and space are no concern, you can pretty much bring what you like to eat at home. If you are going to be carrying it all on your back, it's best to go with dehydrated backpacking meals that you can heat and rehydrate when you get to your next camp. There are a ton of tasty options on the market, and I've researched some of the best for you to try. You'll find all of these in my pack from time to time. Bon appetit!</p>",196
56,rucking backpacks,"<p>When you hear ""rucking backpack,"" you might think of some hard-charging GI trudging through the jungle. But for those who aren't familiar with this old Army jargon, rucking simply means to get from point A to B as steadily and quickly as possible, all the while still being able to continue the mission or face whatever obstacle could be in your way. Today, we are going to talk about the best rucking backpacks on the market to help you do just that.</p><p>Yes, we know that rucking and hiking are almost the same thing. The difference, however, is that rucking implies that some haste is needed. With that, these were chosen with the idea that you had to be somewhere quick, fast, and in a hurry, whether it be a brisk walk with your computer and books for school; or you just realized you're about to miss your flight and now have to skedaddle across the airport. </p><p>To that end, we have compiled a no-nonsense and specifically scrutinized list to help you find the right choice out of the best rucking backpacks on the market. Take a gander and find the choice that's right for you.</p>",195
210,treadmills under 1000,"<p>The best treadmills under $1,000 are all going to have one thing in common - they'll make you sweat. When it comes to running, you either love it or hate it, and during the winter months, it can be hard to get excited about going out and trudging through the snow, ice, or rain. And if you're getting older like me, you probably don't bounce back as quickly from spills on icy sidewalks and roads. A good way to avoid the hazards inclement weather brings and still keep cardio in your daily routine is by adding a treadmill to your flourishing home gym.</p><p>When you think about treadmills, you might picture rows of hulking machines whirring at a fitness center and quickly dismiss the idea of owning one because of how big and expensive they are. Those two factors definitely used to be a big deal, but the design and production cost of quality treadmills has improved dramatically over recent years, and now it's entirely possible to get a high-quality, space-saving option for under $1,000. To help you navigate the ins and outs of the budget treadmill world, we've put together a list of our favorites.</p>",195
43,field watches,"<p>'Field watches' refers to a specific genre of watches, rather than simply referring to watches that one might take to the field. The best field watches not only look like their Vietnam-era counterparts but can also stand up to everything that's thrown at them in a field environment, hailing from a time when the mark of a military man or woman was the plain, utilitarian, easy-to-read watch that kept time, every time. Brands that became famous for this were Hamilton, Glycine, Marathon, Seiko, Rolex, and Elgin, among many others, gracing the wrists of U.S. service members up until the advent of cheap digital watches like the Casio G-Shock in the 1980s. Modern-day field watches are a nod to this history, often featuring plain black dials with white indices or numerals. These watches are also often utilitarian in design, slim, lightweight, and use mechanical movements for maximum reliability.</p><p>All of the field watches featured in this article were tested and evaluated based on a number of features and by multiple military volunteers of varying levels of watch affinity in order to provide first thoughts. Here's why one of these watches deserves a place on your wrist.</p>",194
87,nato straps,"<p>NATO straps are gloriously simple. Compared to a traditional two-piece watch band, the military-theme strap is a single piece of fabric that slips through both spring bars of the watch. It's easy to add or remove and doesn't require any tools. For many, the simple nylon strap is appealing because it's comfortable, inexpensive, and offers a very casual look.</p><p>And, yes, NATO watch straps have a legitimate military heritage dating back to the 1970s. Originally, the design was popularized by British troops who preferred it because it was cheap, easy to clean, and held up well against water. Across the pond, they called it a ""G10"" strap, but it was also given a National Stock Number, which is standardized for member countries in the North Atlantic Trade Organization. Thus, in common parlance, it is called a NATO strap.</p><p>However, not all NATO straps are created equal. The best NATO straps stand out because they use better construction materials, design features, and more appealing aesthetics. With that in mind, here are some of the best NATO straps to fit any need and which look as at home on a G-Shock as they do on a Rolex.</p>",193
156,1000 lumen flashlight,"<p>It's no mystery that being able to see your surroundings is critical to functioning properly - whether during an emergency or just feeling around in your garage. Handheld flashlights are small enough to fit in a pocket, tough enough to work as a blunt force object, and have an impressive military history. You can trace it back to the MX-991/U GI flashlights used during World War II, but tech has come a long way since then. Nowadays, we have the advantage of long-lasting LED lights, more durable materials, and rechargeable batteries.With all these modern developments, you can pick the optimal amount of light to shine on your surroundings. A 1000 lumen flashlight is powerful enough to shine up to 200 meters into the distance - bright enough to see clearly, yet not enough to give up your position to the folks down the road. While it's pretty easy to find a run-of-the-mill option, if you're looking for the best 1000 lumen flashlights on the market, it takes some doing. </p><p>To help you along, we've tracked down the top selections and thrown in some tips on finding the perfect set for your personal style.</p>",193
60,boot knives,"<p>A boot knife may come across as something of an anachronism. It's what outlaws and gamblers wore in the Wild West, right? Who wears a boot knife these days, except for wannabe gangsters, wannabe secret agents, or the new lieutenant who desperately wants to look like an operator (who may have been me)? It's easy to pooh-pooh boot knives, but they're actually useful tools.</p><p>For the folks who carry boot knives, some see it as a last-ditch weapon while others just like having a knife on hand for any contingency. Compared to a standard fixed-blade, a boot knife is smaller, narrower, and oftentimes thinner. While the name suggests it's meant to be worn inside or around a boot, it's a little misleading. It's designed for concealability, so you can wear it wherever you find it most convenient like on your belt or even around your neck. Plus, they look really cool.</p><p>If you find your interest piqued and now want to know what are the best boot knives, we've got you covered. We've researched and tested a variety of knives to help you choose the best one (or two, or three) for your needs.</p>",192
341,flashlights,"<p>I probably own at least a half dozen flashlights at any given time. There's always a steady rotation coming in and out of the house. If you're a gear addict, you know the feeling. If not, you might be missing out on the joys of having the right tool for any job.</p><p>Owning multiple flashlights is like owning standard and metric socket sets or several pairs of boots - it allows you to perform a wide range of work with purpose-built equipment that makes life easier; not harder.</p><p>Let's establish a few basic premises. First, you need an EDC flashlight. That's a given; you need something versatile that can perform in a variety of environments. If you spend any amount of time in the field (professionally or personally), a headlamp is key. We also recommend having something on standby for power outages and more serious emergencies. You might even want to add a weapon light to your shopping list to round out your home defense setup. We took the time to think through all this so you can cut right to the chase and find the best flashlights out there. Now, let's dive in.</p>",192
271,water bottles,"<p>We get it - even the best water bottle reviews can get monotonous. If it's water-tight and has a lid, what more is there to say? That approach might be good enough for some people, but we actually give a shit about your paycheck and want to make sure the gear you buy on our word is worth the cost.</p><p>Instead of being dazzled by social media marketing campaigns and flashy colors, we dug deeper to find water bottles that actually add value. After all, the best camping water bottle and the best cycling water bottle are two very different things. There are times and places for stainless steel and plastic, so we included both. Part of the reasoning behind buying a reusable water bottle is to reduce our environmental impact, so we prioritized companies that take that responsibility seriously.</p><p>A fair amount of market research went into this gear guide, but the top picks went to products I've personally used and trust with my health. You can be sure that every water bottle you see here is one I'd trust during a field exercise, extended backcountry trip, or day on the trails.</p>",191
275,hiking poles,"<p>Hiking poles have been a standard part of my packing list for a few years now. I used them - well, one - for the first time during a 2015 climbing trip in Grand Teton. After reaching the top, we had to make the 7,000-foot descent back to the trailhead through rocky terrain. Standing 6-foot-3, I felt like a giraffe walking on stilts as my guide cruised down the talus slope using trekking poles.</p><p>He noticed how slow I moved and offered to let me try one of his poles for a few miles. I immediately noticed a difference. With a third-point of contact, I felt more stable and confident moving downward over the loose, rocky terrain. As soon as I got home, I ordered a pair and started using them every time I went out.</p><p>Over the past six years of use, hiking poles have allowed me to move over rugged terrain quickly and confidently while carrying a heavy pack. They've also saved me from having a number of bad falls and kept me (relatively) injury-free. I highly recommend them. With that said, here are my picks for the best hiking poles.</p>",191
276,running shorts for women,"<p>Whether you only run a few times a week or you enjoy pounding the pavement for hours at a crack, your clothing can either make or break the happy factor of your workouts, investing in the best running shorts for women crucial to your performance and comfort. I know this first hand after my time in the Marine Corps: Our physical fitness bottoms were either the abominably scanty green silkies, which felt like wearing underwear in public, or a heavy green basketball-type short, which felt like wearing a bunched-up diaper and chafed my inner thighs.</p><p>Fast forward 20 years, and high-quality, affordable clothing and shoes are still essential to my running enjoyment. To that end, comfortable, lined shorts that wick away moisture, won't chafe, and have pockets for all of your on-the-go supplies are essential. To make it easy for you, we've researched and tested a lot of women's running shorts so you don't have to, because whether you run two times a year for the physical fitness test or you are crazy enough to run ultramarathons, we all deserve well-fitting athletic gear that won't chafe, get soggy, or redline your budget.</p>",191

97,shooting gloves,"<p>WEAR YOUR GLOVES! Any service member who has ever been injured knows the important C-Y-A factor of wearing your PPE. We have all heard the stories of people getting injured and the first question being, ""were they wearing their [eyepro, kevlar, gloves, etc]?""</p><p>Old sergeants' tales aside, your hands are important, but so is grip. As shooters, that is the trade-off we navigate. On one hand, your hands are vital to shooting, therefore they must be protected from cuts, burns, exposure to lead or the elements, and/or infection. On the other hand, your grip is an important shooting fundamental, one that could mean the difference between a well-placed shot and a flier. Many shooters have calculated the risk versus reward and decided to go without gloves. Thankfully, we live in a world where the tradeoffs are minor. That is, as long as you pick the right pair of gloves for your application.</p><p>In this article, we'll be examining the best shooting gloves for dexterity, hard use, cold weather, and flame resistance. There are tons of glove offerings on the market, so we sought out gloves from reputable brands with proven track records.</p>",190
235,edc flashlights military veterans,"<p>We've all been there in the dark, alone, and something goes bump in the night. Our senses heighten and, in the absence of information, our brains' amygdalae start spooling up to get us ready to fight, flee, or freeze. Is the rustling outside a trash panda checking out thrown-out leftovers, or is a burglar about ready to break into your car? There's only one way to find out, and that task requires light - a big, bright light.</p><p>There are thousands of flashlights on the market, and the outdoor gear reviewers here have evaluated a lot of them. We've been amazed at the improvements in technology over the past few years, making these useful devices brighter, more rugged, lighter, and more rechargeable and sustainable.</p><p>We take a look at dozens of flashlights every year and test them in the field and at home so we can bring you honest, independent recommendations. Over the last month, we've done a number of single product reviews and decided to list the best of them here. When it comes to EDC flashlights, we consider each flashlight's brightness, size, ruggedness/construction, weight, and waterproofness. Here's what we found.</p>",190

158,generators for camping,"<p>If you're looking for a way to make your camping experience feel a little bit less like a field exercise, buying one of the best generators for camping is a huge first step. Instead of cooking dehydrated camping food and having the last song you listened to stuck in your head all night, you'll have the option to bring fresh food and crank up your favorite playlist.</p><p>It's time to learn what retirees in 40-foot motorhomes have known for decades: Bringing along a little bit of civilization goes a long way. At the very least, a compact camp generator can keep handheld devices powered up for days or more. With a larger generator, you can power refrigerated coolers, space heaters, and electric grills. Your campsite will be a true oasis.</p><p>Camping generators have a bonus benefit, too. If everything goes to hell in a handbasket, you'll have a backup source of electricity to power survival necessities like radios, flashlights, and GPS devices. A big enough gas-powered generator can power your whole house. A solar-powered generator can keep you mission-capable almost indefinitely. So, which one should you choose? I'm glad you asked.</p>",189
296,instant pot,"<p>Everyone likes to eat, but not everyone likes to cook. You've got a busy schedule filled with work, hobbies, and working out - not to mention things like showering and sleep. Now, while there's no shame in hitting the drive-through once in a while, overdoing it can start to slow you down. Sure, you can spend hours over the stove simmering and sautéing, but who has the time? Instant pots require next to no attention and result in truly delicious and surprisingly healthy meals. Simply chop up your food, toss it into the cooker along with some broth, beer, or plain old water, turn it on, and walk away. By the time you arrive back home, your slow cooker has done all the work. Instead of chopping bamboo shoots, you could be enjoying a round of Call of Duty and relaxing.</p><p> Whether you're prepping lunches for the week or making chili for the big game, every kitchen needs an instant pot.

309,air mattresses for camping,"<p>I tend to become a monster when I go nights on end without good sleep, so when my adventure partner and I began section hiking the Appalachian Trail a few years ago, researching the <strong>best air mattresses for camping</strong> was a top priority for both of us.</p><p>Then, after hiking almost 700 trail miles and sleeping in every weather condition imaginable, I can honestly say my air mattress is worth its weight in gold. Not only has it protected my backside from burly roots and rocks in quite a few sketchy bush campsites, but because I paid close attention to insulation value when making my purchase, my air mattress has allowed me to camp in four seasons in warmth and comfort.</p><p>But how do you find the best air mattresses for camping when you can't take them for a test drive? Luckily for you, we've done the research and taken the guesswork out of finding a sleep solution that will work for your camping needs. Whether you are going glamping in your backyard or you are gearing up to tackle all 2,190 miles of the Appalachian Trail, we've got you covered.</p>",189
33,tactical backpacks,"<p>The tactical backpack community is interesting. We get the folks who use them for military, law enforcement, or first responder purposes, where they're appropriate tools for the job.But we're also curious about the people who get them for show - especially in the concealed carry crowd - because the morphology of many tactical backpacks is so obviously military and the whole point of carrying a weapon in public is to do so without anyone knowing you are doing so. Of the gear reviewers here who carry concealed, we sure as hell don't do it wearing 5.11 cargo pants and a concealed carry vest while wearing an obviously tactical backpack. That's just bad planning.</p><p>Yet tactical backpacks have their place - typically on the backs of soldiers and infantry Marines, in the squad car trunks of S.W.A.T. members, and in the basements of apocalyptic preppers. To that end, our trusty team of gear reviewers took a look at the range of tactical backpacks on the market to help you decide which are the best for your needs. What did we learn through our hands-on testing? Read on to find out.</p>",188
295,thermos,"<p>Though often associated with civilian wilderness excursions, thermoses actually have a proud military history dating back almost a century. The vacuum technology was developed by Scottish scientist Sir James Dewar who, instead of patenting the invention, enabled companies to advance it. Thermos, the namesake of this article, originated as three independent companies: one in England, one in Canada, and one in the United States. While the First World War marked a downturn in production, the company kicked back into gear in 1931. During World War II, roughly 98 percent of the American Thermos company's products were put towards military usage. After that, the Thermoses became popular amongst military personnel and civilians alike for keeping food and drink warm both on the battlefield and at home.</p><p>In 1963, the phrase 'thermos' became a general term for all vacuum flasks, and to this day, they are found everywhere from lunch kits to the battlefield. But, without a standard-issue flask, it can be tricky to pin down a good option. To help, we've curated a list of the best thermoses on the market, along with some tips on finding the right fit.</p>",188
52,walkie talkies,"<p>If your primary reason for shopping for the best walkie talkies is to have an excuse to use callsigns, I can't blame you. I remember when my buddy and I convinced our Marines that there was a NATO formula used to determine callsigns we had given them, like ""frosting,"" ""sprinkles,"" and ""albatross.""</p><p>Of course, there are other reasons to look for the best walkie talkies beyond making up games for yourself and your friends. They're a huge asset in emergency situations that knock out phone lines and cell service, but they're also really helpful when you're traveling in a group, whether you're hiking a mountain or road-tripping in a convoy across the country.<br/><br/>The good news is that there are a lot of great options, and they don't cost a whole lot. If you have some room in your budget, you can up your game with beefy radios that pack all kinds of tech like text messaging and GPS navigation. We picked some of the best the market has to offer for this gear guide and found some great background information to help you make an informed purchase. Over.</p>",187
247,treadmills,"<p>I have been informed by the running influencers of Instagram that the world is full of scenic paths, breathtaking views, and effortless strides bathed in golden sunrises. My experience has been different. Most of the running I did in the Marine Corps involved some combination of scorching heat, suffocating humidity, freezing cold, and downright hostile drivers. And a reflective belt. Always a reflective belt.</p><p>For die-hard runners, that's all part of the charm, but for people who run because they have to, not because they want to, the proposition of running indoors is very appealing. Whether you need to knock out a few miles before work or rehab an injury, you can take care of business right at home.</p><p>Consumer-grade treadmills offer most (if not all) of the perks of the commercial treadmills at the base gym right in your own home. They can be small enough to fold into an apartment closet, and affordable enough to be offset by the money you'll save driving to the gym. Hell, they just might make you want to add a few miles or a creative new workout to your weekly routine.</p>",187
272,camping coffee makers,"<p>Whether your campsite tends to be a dozen feet from a car or in the middle of the Pacific Crest Trail, there's a powerful, invigorating feeling evoked when the aroma of freshly brewed coffee floats amongst the tents on a chilly, mist-shrouded morning. A successful camping trip requires - at a minimum - certain essential items, right? Shelter, dry clothes, food, and a great camping coffee maker - because even when all else goes to hell, having a hot cup of joe can set your mind right and help salvage the worst of camping experiences.</p><p>But camping by definition makes cooking, in general, more challenging than when you're at home, and this is also true for making coffee. You can't just throw a Mister Coffee into your backpack, so now you've got to decide how to brew the nectar of the gods. Don't worry, we've got you covered. By the time you've finished this guide, you'll know exactly what kind of camping coffee maker you should get to ensure that, no matter what may come during your next outdoor adventure, at the least you'll face it properly caffeinated.</p>",187

213,camping lanterns,"<p>Camping lanterns are a great way to keep your campsite fired up after dark and make a cabin or tent feel more like home. They also have a pretty badass history that you can regale your friends with every time you use one.</p><p>Obviously, we all know about the ""one if by land, two if by sea"" code and Paul Revere's midnight ride. Lanterns were also used by members of the underground railroad to mark safe houses. They continued to be used by actual railroads into the 1900s to mark significant points and pass instructions. In fact, the use of colored globes eventually led to the red, yellow, and green traffic lights we use today. See, you didn't think you'd learn this much from a camping lantern review but here you are - already smarter.</p><p>We tracked down some of the best camping lanterns out there to help you cut to the chase.

48,hidden gun safes,"<p>Whether you want to admit it or not, there's something undeniably cool about hidden gun safes. Having a pistol appear in a backlit drawer that pops out of a nightstand, or sliding a mirror aside to reveal a stack of rifles in the wall, feels like something straight out of a Hollywood action flick - and far too cool for our own homes.</p><p>But what if you could actually have such a thing?

38,long range walkie talkies,"<p>Comms are dark sorcery, and ""long-range walkie talkies"" can sound like an oxymoron, but the best long-range walkie talkies are actually quite simple to use, based on their ability to address different frequencies, accept better antennas, and increase output power.</p><p>One of the most amusing things about watching Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 was their use of unencrypted Baofeng radios as their primary mode of communication. For those listening, it's led to hilarious comms exchanges, but it's also been linked to the deaths of several Russian generals. This is because they did not have properly established comms, and were not using proper encryption keys, like modern militaries.</p><p>Thankfully, you, the average Joe or Josephine, have access to better comms than the Russian military, and with this article, your own radio, and maybe a HAM radio class or two, you will have communications for your next wilderness adventure. Because when you're in the mountains of West Virginia, the forests of the Pacific Northwest, or the scorching bright heat of the Sonoran Desert in California, cell reception isn't always reliable, but emergency assistance can be imperative.</p>",184
13,tactical belts,"<p>For many who carry a sidearm, a tactical belt is a core element of the carry system. The holster supports the gun and the belt supports the holster.

194,tactical wallets,"<p>Before we go any further, ask yourself what you need in a tactical wallet.

198,climbing packs,"<p>If hiking backpacks - designed to slog heavy loads over long distances - are the generalist of the backcountry world, then climbing packs are the specialists. Climbing packs are designed with a narrow and tapered profile, use durable and abrasion-resistant material like Dyneema or Spectra reinforced ripstop nylon, and exclude comfort features like foam padding on hip belts, back panels, and shoulder straps to save weight. Climbing packs are built that way becuase mountaineering requires technical gear such as ropes, slings, carabiners, harnesses, belay devices, helmets, cams, nuts, ice axes, avalanche shovels, avalanche probes, snow pickets, and crampons, so they need specific places and attachment points to stow them all.</p><p>To that end, best climbing packs will haul all your gear from the trailhead to the base of the climb but won't impede your ability to climb. Gear makers accomplish this by finding the right balance of storage space, durability, and wearability. Here's how the climbing packs on our list shook out after rigorous testing - and why one of them might just be your new best friend for your next big climb.</p>",182

25,dive watches under 500,"<p>There are so many reasons to buy a dive watch. Maybe you want an extremely durable and readable watch. Maybe you love the look of the oversized dial and the feel of stainless steel. Or maybe you actually need it for diving.

216,headlamps,"<p>Being an MRE master chef requires resourcefulness, attention to detail, patience-and a digestive tract made of steel. I've cooked up plenty of masterpieces in the field, fueled by my refusal to sneak Chick-Fil-A sandwiches into my ILBE and my ability to trade cheese pouches for marble cake. All those meals were prepared after dark, and they required my trusty headlamp to get the job done.</p><p>Of course, I suppose you could use headlamps for other important things. You could read a map, follow a hiking trail, or change a tire on the side of the road. If I had one when some friends and I camped in Big Sur one Fourth of July, I wouldn't have used poison ivy as a handhold to get me up a steep embankment.</p><p>It stands to reason that having your hands free is a big advantage, no matter what you're trying to do. That's why we rounded up some of the best buys in headlamps today. Dive into this list to learn what separates the good from the great, and pick the one that's right for you.</p>",181
220,garmin watches,"<p>Garmin watches are generally regarded as the best in the business, but anecdotal testimonies don't really paint an accurate picture of just how dominant the brand is in the outdoor space. In 2021, for example, Garmin raked in a whopping $4.98 billion in revenue. That's a lot of smartwatches, gang.</p><p>Technically, a lot of that money was spent on GPS units, dive computers, satellite communicators, and equipment for aviation and maritime use - but the fact remains that Garmin has serious dough, know-how, and drive to create unparalleled GPS watches for military and civilian use. Just ask the Navy aviators who used their Garmins to navigate home after an aerial mishap, or, you know, any lost lieutenant.</p><p>I sifted through Garmin's extensive watch catalog to find the very best ones for military personnel.

340,bookshelf speakers,"<p>If you're looking to enhance the way you listen to music, sound, and other kinds of audio, you have to have a quality pair of speakers.

149,camping flashlights,"<p>In the mountains of northwest Montana, the rains of spring are washing away memories of fresh-powder skiing and days spent snowshoeing under clear blue skies as winter slowly releases its grip on Flathead Valley. While the peaks of the Lewis range will remain crowned with snow for many months, it's time to begin making plans for summer. The anticipation of days spent camping in the backcountry steadily grows as sunlight lingers a bit longer each passing day.</p><p>The seasoned adventurer will make good use of the remaining days of spring to carefully review, maintain, and if appropriate, upgrade their kit to ensure maximum enjoyment in the field. Despite the longer days and warmer nights, a key piece of gear for any camping endeavor is the humble, but essential, flashlight.</p><p>In this article, we will cover in depth the best camping flashlights. To facilitate the discussion and narrow the field of possibilities to a more manageable size, we will consider only vehicle-dependent camping scenarios, which presumes that weight is not a major consideration and external power sources are available to some degree.</p>",179
181,emergency radio,"<p>After seeing blizzards in Texas and stock trends driven by Reddit, you probably don't need to be told that life can take unexpected turns in a hurry. Now, imagine yourself in front of your computer or TV as a reporter tells you that extreme weather is on the way and it's critical that everyone - and the signal cuts out. Your lights go dark and your faucets run dry. That all-important cell phone turns into a paperweight the second cellular service vanishes. In that situation, a little bit of old-fashioned tech can make a big difference.</p><p>The emergency radios on this list are built to deliver important information in the worst of conditions. Their extended battery life and layers of redundant recharging systems keep them up and running long after other electronics have tapped out. Bonus features increase the value they add to a survival kit. Best of all, there is enough variety for everyone to find what they're looking for. We picked five of the best emergency radios for this gear guide, so read on to learn more.</p>",178
249,gas masks,"<p>In recent years, U.S. service members have realized that gas masks aren't just for suffering through yearly gas mask qualifications, but are useful tools for any sort of situation where airborne chemicals or particulates are present. The western United States experiences wildfires and high levels of airborne smoke, which can aggravate respiratory illnesses, and during the BLM protests in 2020, many people realized that the clouds of CS gas used by the police affected everyone, even if they weren't physically at the protest.</p><p>These hazards are nothing new, and people have taken to purchasing subpar (but heavily advertised) gas masks as a way to remediate this. The advantage here is that there are ways that you can actually own the same gas masks trusted by military CBRNE specialists, and we're here to show you these ways, and offer some important tips on how to make sure that the next time there's some sort of airborne contaminant, you're set. Remember, when buying used, and at least once a year, check the seals of your gas mask to prevent contaminant infiltration.</p>",178
286,snow chains,"<p>Each winter, you'd swear half the drivers on the road mark the changing seasons by removing their brains and tucking them safely away until spring. With summer tires spinning, traction lights flashing, and a look of total shock on their faces, they slide right through busy intersections. Most of this is driver error; some of it is inappropriate equipment selection, although that's also the fault of the driver. Spare yourself the yuletide humiliation by investing in winter tires, at a minimum. For deeper snow and boiler-plate ice, you'll need to step up your game with some kind of enhanced traction. Snow chains are a tried and true solution, and many states require them under certain weather conditions. We're certainly fans of classic snow chains, but a few other approaches deserve your attention, too.</p><p>Which option you choose will ultimately depend on how you plan on using it. Will you be covering long distances in deep snow, or do you just need a little help getting unstuck every so often? In either case, there's something for you on this list.</p>",178
45,drop leg holsters,"<p>While the general public may think of Lara Croft cosplays and Hollywood action movies whenever they think of drop-leg holsters, the reality is that drop-leg holsters don't just look tactical, they serve on the thighs of people in the most dangerous environments in the world today. By dropping the holster down from the gun belt to the thigh, more room is afforded for heavier body armor with side plates and pouches, plus freeing up some real estate on the belt itself for extra utility. Drop-leg holsters are about as overt as you can get, being preferred in high profile situations by everyone from Navy SEALS and British SAS to the FBI Hostage Rescue Team and SWAT teams the world over.</p><p>But what makes for a good drop-leg holster?

248,running belts,"<p>Praying that your phone doesn't slingshot out of your hand on a jog is enough to get you sweating before you even start, but an excellent running belt will help you focus on that journey. Running or jogging belts, or as I prefer to call them, slim-fit fanny packs, serve as ingenious storage solutions for athletes needing to carry their goodies on the go. A few dozen products primarily occupy an admittedly niche product on the market, but each makes a case for itself as a standout worth your time, so allow us to sort them out for you.</p><p>Enter our buyer's guide to the best running belts on sale today, with an athletic waist pouch to fit every road warrior. Need extra storage for the long haul to carry that much-needed fuel? You're in the right spot.

79,rescue knife,"<p>While driving home, some hotshot cuts you off, forcing you to slam on the brakes and flipping you off as he barrels past. Before you can finish your mental prediction, he clips another car, and they both go careening off the road. You and a couple of nearby motorists pull over and rush to the scene. As you exit your car, you grab your emergency kit and involuntarily slap your pocket, checking to make sure your rescue knife is ready and waiting in its proper place. While someone calls 911 and others approach the minivan, you head toward the speedster. His car has rolled a full 360 degrees, landing upright again, but effectively sealing him inside with a bloody scalp and a smoking engine bay in front of him. You know help is coming, but the kid needs help pronto. He is conscious, so you signal to him what you plan to do. You yank your rescue knife from your pocket, then shatter the window with its carbide tip. </p><p>It's a good thing you were ready.</p>",176
305,hydration pack,"<p>If you've ever had to cover a serious amount of ground, you know two things: Thirst is real and water is heavy. A hydration pack can't eliminate the weight of water, but it can let you carry it in a more convenient way. The last thing you want when hiking a dusty trail is the boxy edge of your water bottle stabbing into your leg. A hydration pack is built to contour to the shape of its surroundings, avoiding issues with towing a bulky structure. Made to enhance your performance during strenuous activities, hydration packs incorporate a drinking system - a straw of sorts that lets you drink on the move. Sure, stopping to get your water might seem like it doesn't take much time, but if you're racing to a rendezvous point, every moment counts. </p><p>Because this tactical supply is so popular, there are a slew of options out there. To cut through the noise, we've pinned down the best hydration packs available, along with some advice on finding the right pick for your journey.</p>",176
19,gun oils,"<p>You count on rifles, pistols, and shotguns to work when the time comes, and that means using the best gun oil. This seems to be the age-old question when it comes to firearms: which type of oil or brand to use. Sure, people bicker over which caliber is the best all arounder or the proper technique to fire from certain positions, but everyone who has cleaned a gun has asked themselves if the oil they are using is the best. When I was on active duty in the Marine Corps, it was a no brainer: We used the free generic cleaner, lubricant, and protectant issued to us. Since leaving the military, I've searched for the best so my guns are fully operational.</p><p>Picking the right gun oil boils down to intended use and desired performance. All-in-ones like the military-issued CLP sound appealing because of the convenience they offer. Are they as good as specialized oils or solvents, though? Let's break things down so you don't get stuck when you go to buy your next gun oil.</p>",175
100,gun safes,"<p>Finding the right gun safe can be a big chore because there's so much variation in size, construction, locking mechanisms, and price. It can be hard to know what's worth paying for, what's unnecessary, and what's just crap.</p><p>No matter what segment you're shopping in, having an extra layer of protection for your firearms is a good idea. Parents need to be extremely careful about how they store guns in the house. Even if you don't have kids, it's a good idea to keep your guns out of the hands of house guests - invited or uninvited. Maybe that means stashing them in a hidden gun safe that you can access quickly. It could mean investing in a heavy-duty safe that can withstand crowbars and fire.<br/>We've been rounding up the best gun safes for every size, style, and budget and have landed on a few favorites.

291,hunting blinds,"<p>If you hunt, you know that every opening day makes you feel like a kid on Christmas morning. With gear staged by the door and maybe a dog or two shaking with excitement, you hop out of bed for a splash of coffee and hit the road before the first signs of sunlight. Every game animal requires unique gear and strategy, but most of them come around easier if you have a good hunting blind. We don't care how disciplined you are; at some point, you're going to need to adjust your seating position or turn to check your surroundings.

349,fitness trackers,"<p>Even after just a few weeks without regular training, you might be shocked to see that your hard work appears for naught. When there's no early morning runs and drills taking you to the edge, it can be easy to rest on your laurels. Fitness isn't permanent - it takes continuous work. If you want to be able to pull off a run like George MacKay in 1917, or even just crush your next round of PT, you're going to have to keep up the cardio. But how can you tell if you're getting the job done? Instead of putting a finger to your pulse and timing out heartbeats, most modern trainers prefer fitness trackers. Measuring everything from distance to calories to heart rate, these watch-like devices take the mystery out of exercise. Of course, that relies on you finding the right fit for your workout style - something accurate, comfortable, and tough.</p><p>To help you track down the best fitness trackers around, we've compiled a list of the most reliable options. Let's take a look.</p>",175

Not only are they fun as hell, but they're extremely diverse and adaptable - and, at times, a bit too close to home for those who actually specialize in handling real-life weapons professionally.

I thought so.</p><p>To that end, we have rounded up a selection of the best Nerf gun (and Nerf-like guns) fit for the standard U.S. military infantry squad - and then some.

303,camping tents,"<p>The first time I hauled a camping tent into the wilderness on my own, I remember being a little irritated. Compared to my trusty Marine Corps poncho, tents are bulky and heavy. It also seemed like a weak move to bring such a structure into the woods.</p><p>I felt differently after the torrential rain hit. High in the Sierra Nevadas, the sky opened up with an onslaught of heavy rain that lasted most of the night. Even with running water flowing around and under my tent, the inside stayed nice and dry. That was a blessing because low temperatures would have spelled disaster for wet gear and forced me to make a forced hike more than 10 miles back to the trailhead.</p><p>I woke up the next morning not exactly rested, but with a newfound appreciation for a good tent. Maybe my poncho wasn't the best option, after all. Take a lesson from my precautionary tale and set yourself up with the best camping tent you can get your hands on from the beginning.</p>",172

High in the Sierra Nevadas, the sky opened up with an onslaught of heavy rain that lasted most of the night. Even with running water flowing around and under my tent, the inside stayed nice and dry. That was a blessing because low temperatures would have spelled disaster for wet gear and forced me to make a forced hike more than 10 miles back to the trailhead.</p><p>I woke up the next morning not exactly rested, but with a newfound appreciation for a good tent. Maybe my poncho wasn't the best option, after all. Take a lesson from my precautionary tale and set yourself up with the best camping tent you can get your hands on from the beginning.</p>",172
50,neck knives,"<p>A neck knife is a smaller fixed-blade knife that's carried by suspending the sheath from your neck with a cord or chain. Its widespread use is such that it's almost impossible to narrow down its exact origins, but cultures all over the world had their own variants, from indigenous peoples to the Vikings. They're frequently used for utilitarian purposes, though there are variants designed as last-ditch blades for self-defense, frequently in the form of a push-dagger or karambit.</p><p>Chances are you've seen a depiction of a mountain man, Native American, or hunter wearing a neck knife at some point, and I know I personally have worn several during my brief-yet-cringey tenure as a ""mall ninja."" They're a great option for people with limited pocket or belt real estate, such as rock climbers or kayakers. Whether you're looking for a blade for everyday carry, self-defense, adventuring, or just a backup, to your backup, to your backup, we're here with some of the best neck knives on the market that made the cut.</p>",170
69,aviation watches,"<p>Sometimes a watch is more than just a watch, and the best aviation watches function not only as timekeeping devices but also as navigation aids. An aviation watch was once an essential piece of an aviator's kit during the golden age of flying, where a pilot, copilot, or navigator would have to manually calculate things like fuel expenditure, rate of climb, and conversion of statute miles to nautical miles. Other aviation watches of the era were simple ""Flieger"" watches, which have relatively large and simple dials and were intended for military aviators to keep accurate mission time and get munitions on target on time.</p><p>The world of aviation watches is vast and full of many similar-looking brands, and today's list aims to bring you the best no matter your needs or budget. Whether you want a new watch to match some recently acquired wings, or you love aviation history and want to own something to pay homage to manned flight, we've got you covered with the best aviation watches worth owning.</p>",170
90,closet gun safes,"<p>Safes are a must-have for gun owners. A safe keeps firearms secure and protected from curious children and would-be thieves, and some even protect guns and other valuables from disasters such as house fires. That said, not everyone has the space for a 24-gun safe with a two-by-three-foot footprint, and weighs 750 pounds. Additionally, a large gun safe is visually loud and expressive as to its contents, which may lead to questions, and presents a large target.</p><p>Closet gun safes provide a more compact alternative, keeping firearms, documents, and valuables tucked away with your extra shoes and the odd spider. Smaller and lighter in weight, these are perfect for those in townhomes and apartments, as well as folks that just don't need a steel behemoth in their basement. When properly secured, you maintain the advantage and peace of mind that comes from knowing that your firearms are safely stowed and hidden at the back of the closet alongside your favorite hat and that sweater grandma got you last year for Christmas.</p>",170
222,water purification tablets,"<p>What's faster? Light, lightning, or diarrhea? Answer: Diarrhea - because you run like lightning to the bathroom, turn on the light, and find the diarrhea beat you there. And while some people think it's funny while it's really brown and runny, getting a bad gut in the backcountry is no laughing matter. At best, it will make you miserable AF. At worst, you could die. So choosing water sources carefully is super important as is the method by which you purify your drinking water.</p><p>To save your ass from your own bad decisions, your trusty writers here have reviewed many of the commonly available water purification tablets (and droplets) for your water treatment use. We reviewed specs, read some science stuff about bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, checked a few government websites, drank copious amounts of coffee and later beer, asked the Magic 8 Ball a few questions, and then prepared to elucidate so the next time you play pull my finger in the woods, your butt won't let out a zinger.</p>",170
236,first aid kits,"<p>Ever heard of Murphy? You know, that guy whose law can both be a big pain and cause big pain? He has a way of wrecking life's best-laid plans (and your ER budget), but when you prepare for his next visit, it becomes a bit less memorable and a bit less painful - especially when that preparation puts one of the best first aid kits front and center.</p><p>Oddly enough, though, shopping for first aid kits can be a bit more challenging than you might expect, and when words like ""sterile"", ""acetaminophen"", and ""trauma"" show up on a shopping list, it gets incredibly easy to ""forget"" what you need a grab the simplest looking item on the shelf, putting both your wallet and your churning stomach a bit more at ease. Murphy likes it that way, but we don't.</p><p>To that end, we put together a guide to the best first aid kits on the market to boost your confidence and peace of mind while taking some spring out of Murphy's step.</p>",170
273,agility ladders,"<p>Something as simple as a well-made agility ladder can prove to be quite a handy tool for anyone looking to hone their footwork and get a good burn going.

292,foam rollers,"<p>If you're searching for the best foam rollers on the market, chances are you're already feeling the pain of working out, getting old, or just sitting in an office chair all day. Typically, a foam roller is not something you buy when everything is hunky-dory and you're feeling like a million bucks. Instead, it tends to be a reactionary purchase to workout soreness, muscle or spinal ailments, or a degradation in your range of movement. Making sure you purchase the right roller is an important part of the recovery and sustainment process.</p><p>Navigating the long list of foam roller options could be a daunting task, especially if you're unclear about what the differences could mean for you and your pesky injury.

103,ankle holsters,"<p>Self-defense is a human right, and while you may not be able to get away with slinging an M249 over your shoulder while you pick up your morning Starbucks, that doesn't mean you have to leave your rock chucker at home. Carrying a concealed self-defense weapon is an art that must satisfy a number of requirements, and sometimes, an ankle holster is the only way to pack heat without attracting undesirable attention. Some see ankle rigs as gimmicky, and some products certainly live up to that reputation. On the flip side, other ankle holsters have the potential to impress the most open-minded skeptics.

150,tactical gloves,"<p>It's pretty hard to get any kind of tactical advantage without the use of your hands. Now, while gloves might not literally transform your hands into an assault rifle, tactical gloves offer a host of benefits. Protecting your skin from contagion and abrasion alike, the primary purpose of your gloves is to keep your hands safe. On the tactical end of things, reinforced knuckles and breathable yet tough material stops you from getting hurt. Ever thrown a punch without wrapping your hands? The damage can range from cut-up knuckles to broken fingers.Not only do tactical gloves keep your hands safe, but they also drastically improve grip. </p><p>While there's no doubt that the benefits of tactical gloves are far-reaching, it can be a challenge to find the right pair.

27,whetstones,"<p>Keeping your favorite, most-used knives sharp is a chore. No matter how frequently - or infrequently - you break out your knives and use them, they become dull over time. And the knives you rely on most often are the ones that'll dull the quickest. Relying on a dull knife means you're using a less effective and potentially more dangerous tool, as dull knives can make cutting harder and less precise. </p><p>This is where the best whetsones come in. While sharpening your knives is certainly a chore, it can be made easier with a solid, quality whetstone. Whetstones, which are also called sharpening stones, are the perfect DIY sharpening tool.

252,camo pants,"<p>Offering both functional and stylish advantages, camo pants remain popular for use in all sorts of situations well beyond their military origins. Once used primarily by U.S. and foreign military personnel as a method of concealment in natural settings, the pattern gained popularity among civilian consumers starting in the 1980s as hunting became a more prevalent pastime. Nowadays, you can find a pair of camo pants just about everywhere. Most options are ruggedized, featuring significantly more pocket storage than conventional pants, and designed to work well outdoors. On the other hand, there are more comfort-focused styles for a more camo-casual experience. Either way, available camo patterns differ just as much as existing pants, so you'll always find something available for the mission ahead.</p><p>Depending on whether you plan to use the pants tactically or casually, you'll need a different pair.

163,sweatpants for men,"<p>I know what you're going through because I've been there, too. It's halftime in a close game. You're three beers and a dozen jalapeno poppers deep.

269,dry bags,"<p>So, you've assembled a bunch of gear and a comfy pack to carry it all - but if you don't have dry bags to protect it from the elements, you're asking for trouble. A little bit of rain can destroy electronics. Wet clothes can invite hypothermia in surprisingly mild temperatures.

Indeed, every prepper and survival enthusiast has one thing in common: a well-stocked bug-out bag. More than a backpack, these bags are designed to let you survive even the most extreme situations.

126,10x42 binoculars,"<p>Even if you're seeing with 20/20 vision, the human eye is pretty limited.

119,hunting gps,"<p>Finding the best hunting GPS can be the difference between a successful hunt in the hinterlands and a desperate search for civilization after you become inescapably lost. As a former Junior Officer in the Army, I've heard my fair share of jokes about getting lost - trust me, they're funny every time - and I know the importance of always being aware of my surroundings, but a good GPS can be applied to hunting in many more ways than just finding your way from point A to point B.

317,charcoal grills,"<p>If napalm in the morning is the best smell in the world, burgers on the grill must be a close second. It doesn't matter if the yard is covered in freshly cut grass or a foot of snow, sizzling meat over an open flame satisfies an almost primal hunger. We can debate the merits of grills that use charcoal, propane, or wood all day long, but they all make delicious food. One thing that's not disputed is how easy it is to grill up a masterpiece with good old-fashioned charcoal. This fuel source is inexpensive, efficient, and easy to use. Not having to guess how much propane is left in your tank is a nice bonus. So, once you've decided on a charcoal grill, which one is for you?

20,survival knives,"<p>It can often prove difficult to nail down exactly what constitutes a survival knife. For some, a survival knife might simply mean a fixed blade that can withstand something more than pocket carry. For others, survival literally means holding onto one's life against the torments of the wilderness as they deliberately throw themselves into the wild with nothing but a knife and maybe the clothes on their back. Since it's impossible to state definitively that one knife will work for anyone, regardless of who they are, buying a survival knife means compiling a survey of the best ones, no matter your usage, budget, or size needs, and whittling the choices down from there. With any luck, the result will serve you well during your next outdoor adventure.</p><p>To that end, we've put together a list of the best survival knives that the gear reviewers here have managed to lay their hands on.

Whether it's crafting an expedient litter to carry an injured person to safety, building a shelter to keep warm and dry, or crafting a greenwood grill to cook food, bushcraft techniques are invaluable tools in the repertoire of any serious outdoors enthusiast. Specialized knives which prioritize coarse tasks like stripping branches, drilling holes, and splitting logs are essential for bushcraft tasks.</p><p>The best bushcraft knives will commonly have a Scandinavian grind and are ideally full-tang to achieve the durability required for arduous outdoor tasks.

The company got its start during America's bicentennial year and settled in Golden, Colorado, the company's long-time hometown, two years later. After littering the country with its Tri-Angle Sharpmaker, Spydrceo introduced its first knife, the C01 Worker, in 1981 with the company's classic round thumb hole in the blade. Since then, the company has produced high-quality knives bof legendary fame. Their use of top-tier steel, smart engineering, and a variety of shapes and sizes make Spyderco EDC knives some of the best on the planet. </p><p>But are they the very best? We'll let you duke it out with the Benchmade and Kershaw fans out there.

282,running sunglasses,"<p>You can skimp on some gear, but when it comes to your eyes, you deserve the best protection. That's why we've compiled a list of the best running sunglasses. Whether you rock a pair of White Walker blues, beautiful browns, or hazel peepers, protecting them from damaging UV light is important. The American Optometric Association recommends your sunglasses block out 99 to 100 percent of UVA and UVB rays, screen out 75 to 90 percent of visible light, and that the frames fit close to your eyes and the contour of your head to protect from all angles.

293,survival books,"<p>It may not feel like it from atop our wealth of modern creature comforts, but human beings are survival machines. Our bodies are built to travel great distances and our minds are capable of incredible problem-solving. That natural ability isn't worth much if we don't learn how to use it, though, and there are all too many stories of people who weren't adequately prepared for an unexpected crisis. You're going to have to treat your mind as part of your survival kit if you want to give yourself a fighting chance.</p><p>One of the best ways to prepare for a survival situation is to invest in education.

Whether it's the scorching sun burning your skin to a crisp or heavy wind and rain culling all your calories, the great outdoors is full of challenges.

391,bushcraft knives,"<p>The phrase ""bushcraft"" is often dismissed by novices as just a fancy word for whittling sticks, a perception that makes even the best bushcraft knives seem overkill. The reality is that solid bushcraft skills can (and do) save lives in a wilderness survival setting. Whether it's crafting an expedient litter to carry an injured person to safety, building a shelter to keep warm and dry, or crafting a greenwood grill to cook food, bushcraft techniques are invaluable tools in the repertoire of any serious outdoors enthusiast. Specialized knives which prioritize coarse tasks like stripping branches, drilling holes, and splitting logs are essential for bushcraft tasks.</p><p>The best bushcraft knives will commonly have a Scandinavian grind and are ideally full-tang to achieve the durability required for arduous outdoor tasks.

112,cell phone boosters for rural areas,"<p>Few things are more dangerous than being in the midst of an emergency and unable to make a call. Most heavily-populated areas have well-established cell phone networks, letting you call an ambulance or summon the police at a moment's notice if the situation requires it. Unfortunately, more rural areas have a long way to go in order to meet that standard. Dropped signals result in risky miscommunications and, when paired with the distance between rural settings and major services, the delay is something you just can't afford. Thankfully, cell phone boosters are built specifically to address this issue so you are never without a signal when you need one.</p><p>Of course, as with any new tech, it can be challenging to ID the best cell phone boosters for rural areas.

144,spotting scopes,"<p>We've probably all been guilty of subscribing to the Super Troopers school of shot placement from time to time, but it's best not to admit that. Whether you're dialing your hunting rifle before opening day or scanning the horizon for trophy bucks, it's important to know what you're shooting at and exactly where your shot will land. That's where a spotting scope can help.</p><p>Spotting scopes offer far more magnification than binoculars or a rifle scope. They're mounted on tripods so you can get a clear view at tremendous distances. This isn't just helpful for long-range precision shooters, but it's also useful for anyone who wants to check their target at the local range without waiting to leave the bench during the next cease-fire.</p><p>We rounded up some of the best spotting scopes out there, spanning brands, features, and prices.

208,compact binoculars,"<p>When it comes to optics, a good pair of compact binoculars is a great way to up your game. They're more portable than long-distance binoculars, more usable at moderate distances than a spotting scope, and are much more publicly acceptable than a rifle-mounted optic.</p><p>A lot of attention gets paid to the EDC gear that makes up our everyday carry, but what you keep in your go-bag or vehicle is just as important. We're big fans of throwing a pair of binoculars in the car; the same pair of Bushnell binoculars has been riding shotgun in my trusty rusty for more than a decade. I've used them to spot wildlife, scout dirt bike trails, and keep an eye on roaming bird dogs.</p><p>This list is all about putting the power of magnified optics in your hands without weighing you down. We chased down the best compact options from the best brands to keep this list short, sweet, and packed to the gills with quality equipment.</p>",163
230,dumbbell sets,"<p>Any bodybuilder or strength trainer knows that you can use dumbbells for serious gains. Real talk here: If you walk into a gym that doesn't have dumbbells you should ask for a refund and go find a real gym. As a lifter, it is important to have the versatility offered by dumbbells. Since they're available in almost any increment of weight, you can customize your workouts for progressive results. While adjustable dumbbells have seen a rise in popularity, there's something about an old-school dumbbell that can't be beaten.</p><p>Traditional dumbbells are a simple tool for strength training as they allow you to isolate muscle groups. The typical design has not changed in over a hundred years for this reason. But what makes a dumbbell good? Why spend a lot of money on steel or iron when you can get cheap molds for concrete? If you're asking these questions, then you should read on as we do the heavy lifting research on the best dumbbells.</p>",163

They come in all kinds of styles so you can find the perfect pair for through hikes, day hikes, hunting trips, days at the range, or even the nine-to-five slog. Some of them are so good that we wouldn't blame you if they became your new go-to attire.</p><p>The problem is that there are a lot of manufacturers selling cut-rate pants that don't do what they're supposed to do (or fall apart way too soon). We sorted those out for you, so all you'll see on this list are the best of the best from our favorite brands.</p>",163

36,free standing punching bags,"<p>Combat sports are on the rise across America, and so is the need for free-standing punching bags. Boxing, MMA, and traditional martial arts have captured imaginations far and wide, and the need to train is immense. Regrettably, gym and dojo memberships can be a bit rich for the blood, and for those who can afford it, training venues may get too crowded or may never stay open long enough for them to get in a productive training session. Either way, the ability to train at home can make all the difference.</p><p>Hanging and wall-mounted punching bags populate more than a few basements and garages, but for those who rent their space, move often, or simply need the ability to store their training gear out of the way, a free-standing punching bag can be a lifesaver.

Upon assessing the patient, you pull out your shears, and cut through the hem of his jeans.

As your partner takes over with some shears that actually work, you ask yourself, ""Who makes this kind of junk anyway?""

Famed collegiate football player and hydration expert Robert Boucher Jr. will tell you it's none other than high-quality H2O. Water might not always be the single most critical thing on your list, but it's certainly near the top, so you better have plenty. Notice we said to have plenty – not to pack plenty – because water is also very heavy. If you want a gallon a day, that's more than eight pounds you need to lug around, not to mention all those empty containers. You're much better off packing a hydration bladder or water bottle and a water filter to turn every stream and lake into your own water fountain.</p><p>Being able to purify water on the go isn't just a great way to reduce your pack's weight: it's a reliable, sustainable way to stay hydrated for as long as you need.</p>",161

1,shoulder holsters,"<p>We've all seen someone use a shoulder holster, but most of the time it's on TV. It's the preferred carry method of international spies, private investigators, and tough .44 magnum-toting cops. During my time in Afghanistan, shoulder holsters were also a badge of honor for SNCOs and officers with serious swagger. Most of the time, though, shoulder holsters get dismissed as a gimmick - and I'm not convinced that's fair.</p><p>There are plenty of reasons shoulder holsters aren't just for movie stars. They're very practical for anyone who needs to carry while spending a lot of time behind a desk or in a vehicle. They do a great job of concealing full-size handguns.

Designed for the grossest and most inhospitable environments, duck boots are a sound investment for everyone from the casual hiker to the aspiring backwoods explorer.</p><p>Now, while women's duck boots have a lot in common, picking the right pair can be quite a feat. To lend a hand, we've curated a list of the best women's duck boots available along with some tips on finding the right fit.</p>",157
145,heated gloves,"<p>If you haven't used heated gloves before, you're in for a real treat. Say goodbye to frozen limbs and chills that prevent you from doing even the simplest tasks.</p><p>During my time in the Marine Corps, I once had a company commander who was just sure that our issued cold-weather gear would instantly transform us into helpless babies. He seemed convinced that just having a beanie in your pack would make the rounds fall out of your magazine and turn into the Taliban's favorite flavor of jelly beans. If he found out about gloves that not only insulate hands from the cold but actively keep them warm, he'd probably have a seizure.</p><p>Luckily, none of us are subject to such rules on our own time. If you'd like to put modern technology to work for you and stop watching your fingers turn into icicles, you're in the right place. Let's find the perfect pair of heated gloves for you.</p>",157
260,roof racks cars,"<p>If you've never ventured into the internet wormhole of overlanding vehicles, you're seriously missing out. Adventure-seekers have equipped everything from Jeeps to one-ton trucks and luxury SUVs with meaty tires, roof tents, and granny gears capable of scaling the most rugged terrain imaginable. Hard-core builds like that are expensive and impractical in most real-world driving scenarios, but you can get a taste of that lifestyle with a simple roof rack. According to our mathematicians, adding a roof rack to your vehicle makes it look at least 20 percent cooler–and that increases to 30 percent if you drive a wagon. Better yet, there are styles to fit your vehicle and storage needs regardless of what you drive.</p><p>Should you get an open roof rack, a soft case, or a highway-ready aero box? It's hard to go wrong. Dig into these tasty recommendations and give your car extra cargo room. Maybe you'll score some style points, while you're at it.</p>",157
267,bivy sack,"<p>Sure, you put the days of field training behind you, but there was something about sleeping out under the stars in a bivy sack that never quite left you. Tents have their place, but that one-man tent suddenly looks a bit heavy for your minimalist outdoor adventure setup. You know the areas where you'll be spending your time, and you want to move light and fast, something that tent just won't allow. Ditch the tent, and go for the bivy sack instead. Not only will your pack be lighter and your sleeping bag warmer, but you can also now be a little bit closer to nature, closer to the land, and closer to your ancestors. Now, you can restock your bivy sack memories with something a bit more enjoyable than that of your sergeant's face first thing in the morning.</p><p>Finding the best bivy sack can prove challenging. Luckily, we've narrowed down our picks to the best five.</p>",157
307,fire starter,"<p>Being able to start a fire is one of the oldest and most elemental survival skills you can have. Striking a spark on your own is empowering, and failure is embarrassing, to say the least. It doesn't matter if the plan of the day involves firing up the grill for a gameday barbeque or creating a small fire to purify water in the wilderness, you need to create fire one way or another. In my search for the best fire starters, I encountered everything from prehistoric friction-based tools to battery-powered plasma lighters. There is also a wide selection of tinder out there to make stoking flames that much easier (no, the other tinder, although I guess that sentence would make sense both ways).</p><p> Take a look and see how far fire-starting has come since the days of smoking yourself out in a cave. Go back to your roots or take a step forward with your next purchase.</p>",157
321,gaming chair,"<p>Whether you throw on Call of Duty to relax after a long day or use Battlefield to hone your shooting skills, games are an excellent escape from the world. Not only do PC and platform games let you tune into a different reality, but occasionally they give you a chance to fine-tune your skills. The strategy component of war games especially is a fantastic way to keep your mind sharp, first-person shooters enhance motor coordination, and multiplayer games are a terrific way to keep in touch with buddies and foster team spirit.</p><p><br/>But, as anyone who's ever played a gaming tournament knows, it's all too easy to kink your neck and strain your back - particularly without a proper chair. Picking a gaming chair is about more than just comfort, it's a matter of posture and lumbar support. Selecting a quality gaming chair ensures that when you eventually achieve victory, it isn't a Pyrrhic one for your back.</p>",157
335,treadmills under 500,"<p>So, you're in the market for a new home treadmill. You don't want to break the bank, but you want to get something substantial and durable enough that you won't just end up using it as an overpriced clothing rack. Good news: You can buy a good quality treadmill for less than you may think. And, contrary to popular belief, many of these treadmills come with powerful components and substantial weight limits, so if you're not a 100-pound cheerleader, not to worry.</p><p>When it comes to options for rugged and reliable treadmills under $500, there is a surprising number to choose from. To help ensure you're not just getting sucked in by slick marketing and gimmicks, we've done the heavy lifting for you and come up with our list of top picks. We've also put together an in-depth buying guide that will give you all the ins and outs to get you running in place in no time.</p>",157

148,military books 2,"<p>Let's be real: 2021 wasn't really the year we all wished it had been. As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic stretched on, many of us spent more time than we would have liked behind closed doors, left to our own devices for fun and entertainment. Luckily, our team put some of our downtime to good use: reading some of the best military books of the last few years (and a few older than that) to make the time go by just a little bit faster. You may be stuck at home, or you may just need a new distraction - either way, we've got you covered with some stellar reading material for you to kick off the close of the year the right way.</p><p>Here's a brief list of some of the best books we read here in the last year.

182,rooftop tents,"<p>Some of you are in a real pickle right now. Camping is great, we all agree. But what if hiking and schlepping a week's worth of gear is not so spectacular? Car camping is the perfect solution. It's also a perfect excuse to load up on all kinds of tires, winches, coolers, and camping grills.</p><p>One of the best (and definitely one of the coolest) ways to upgrade your vehicle is to add a rooftop tent. These pieces of kit work great on trucks and rugged SUVs, but they're just as cool on smaller cars. They're impossibly rad on wagons, by the way.</p><p>Rooftop tents aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for and the investment can give you years of unforgettable outdoor adventures. There's a lot of information to digest before you punk down your cold, hard cash, so we're going to break it all down for you, complete with a few of our favorite picks.</p>",156
294,hiking pants,"<p>If you're an avid hiker, then you know just how important it is to find the right gear. Just like good shoes protect your feet from the elements and a hat keeps the sun's glare at bay, hiking pants keep your legs comfortable during those long rucks through the wildness. After all, when you're climbing hills and avoiding roots, you're bound to perspire. Hiking pants are designed to offer adequate ventilation while remaining strong enough to stop twigs and thorns from pricking your skin. From storage opportunities in the pockets to durable fabric that's built to weather the elements, hiking pants have a lot to offer. In order to reap all these benefits, it helps to find the right set of pants for your particular hiking style. The good news is that there are a ton of options out there. We've tracked down the best hiking pants to help you thrive on even the toughest trail.</p>",156

70,pepper sprays,"<p>The logic goes something like this: you can protect yourself better with a fist than a finger, and better with a firearm than a fist. That's true, but you don't have to make a direct leap from unarmed to packing heat. Pepper spray can be an extremely effective means of self-defense. It opens you up to fewer legal implications than carrying a firearm or knife, and creates an opportunity for you to escape dangerous situations without escalating to the use of deadly force. In the case of animal attacks, it can actually be more effective than a firearm. Encounters with large predators like bears can typically be resolved better by deterring them than forcing them to commit to a fight to the death (which, spoiler alert, you probably aren't going to win).</p><p>Pepper spray comes in many forms, so read up on some of the best options out there to find one that works for you.</p>",155
137,folding knives,"<p>There I was, alone and unafraid. From my position seated atop a toilet at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, I prepared to defend myself from the nearby cucarachas that inhabited the building. Armed with only my RAT boots and a motivated folding KA-BAR, I defied staggering odds and emerged victorious from another perilous head call. With a triumphant flush, I cleaned my blade and departed from the battlefield.</p><p>Regardless of your branch of service or MOS, odds are good that a humble folding knife will end up being your most-used piece of gear. Whether on the job or enjoying a long weekend in the backcountry, a reliable, quality blade is something everyone should own. Maybe you're looking for your first knife, or maybe you've acquired a healthy collection already. You can never have too many - and the knives on this list are so good, I wouldn't blame you if you picked up one of each.</p>",155
209,camelbak,"<p>According to doctors, most of America is in a fight for its life with dihydrogen monoxide, and those who spend extended periods of time outdoors find the war against dehydration reaching new levels of intensity. Water is heavy, and the human body needs plenty of it to thrive. Enter the CamelBak. Like the M1 Garand in World War II, this hydration system is an elite, life-saving system for which there is no substitute. When operating out in the field, a CamelBak is absolutely essential. Its high-capacity water reservoir secures all that life-giving liquid close to your back, giving you maximum mobility with minimal drag. </p><p>Whether you need to scale a cliff, fast-rope out of a helo, or shred a backcountry mountain bike trail, don't waste time pondering how to secure a puny water bottle that may or may not be along for the ride. Make like a camel, and keep your water on your back.</p>",155
263,gifts for veterans,"<p>Ahh, it's that magical time of the year when the world gets ready to be a little less ugly to each other. Christmas and Hanukkah are around the corner, bellies will still be full from Thanksgiving, and it's time to start shopping. <br/><br/>If you've got a U.S. military veteran in your life and you're feeling a little stumped on what gifts to get them, then you've come to the right place. I've done the legwork for you and gathered the best gifts for veterans worth shopping for this year. What makes me an authority? <br/><br/>Well, I'm a veteran myself, so that helps. I interact with a pretty diverse group of veterans almost daily, and I'm also one of the gear review dudes here. Also, I give good gifts. I'm not exaggerating. It's something I'm naturally good at. I think this makes me pretty dang qualified to help you find the best gifts for your veteran.</p>",155
300,sleeping bags,"<p>In today's edition of the most luxurious overnight destinations, we'll be leaving the hotels and rental homes far behind. Some of the best places to spend the night are the parks, forest areas, and campgrounds around your house. With the right gear, you can turn a hike and a campsite into an unforgettable experience.</p><p>One of the most important pieces of gear you can bring is your sleeping bag. Take it from someone who's learned the hard way - spending a little money for a quality sleeping bag is worth every cent. Still, there are quality options for just about every budget as long as you have realistic expectations.</p><p>We scoured the internet for some of the best sleeping bags for casual overnight stays indoors, backpacking, and hardcore exploration. There's also enough background information here to help you make an informed decision and take care of your gear once you buy it and put it to use.</p>",155
344,led flashlight,"<p>Whether you are into hiking, camping, backpacking, fishing, or in need of a light in case of emergency, a high-quality LED flashlight can come in handy for a variety of situations. The best LED flashlights are extremely reliable, durable, and come with a number of special features like versatile beam settings that can extend battery life and reach various distances. Many models even include rechargeable batteries that can last for several hours in remote locations while camping or hiking without power. Some LED flashlights can be purchased in value packs, so you can store one flashlight in your vehicle or luggage for trips, and keep another in a drawer in your home in case of emergency. </p><p>Whether you are looking for great value, durability, versatility, or reliability, we took a look at the best LED flashlights currently available on the market.

346,flasks,"<p>Who doesn't appreciate a quick nip now and then? It's all well and good when you're at home or out with friends, but what happens when the mood strikes for a sip of spirits and there's none to be found? We have it on good authority that the Donner party didn't pack enough alcohol for their trip across the Sierra Nevadas, and we know how that worked out for them (That's not to suggest correlation equals causation, but it's a very real case of people not having enough booze, then eating each other. Draw your own conclusions). You'd be smart, then, to play it safe and own a flask that can carry a few ounces of your favorite liquor. You'd be downright brilliant if that flask was capable of being concealed in plain sight.</p><p>Here are eight flasks that will have your back when you get that hankering. Traditional or novelty, there's something here for you.</p>",155

94,rain ponchos,"<p>The waterproof poncho is the go-to defense against rain for military, hunters, backpackers, and soccer moms and dads alike, and for good reason. The best ponchos are light, easy to transport, provide protection against the elements for a large part of your body, and are simple to put on and take off. But it may come as a surprise that, depending on your outdoor activity, some ponchos are better choices than others.</p><p>The best ponchos are waterproof, and many are truly flexible and multifunctional. Need to keep the kiddos dry at a concert or baseball game? Put on a poncho. Backpacking, and find yourself in need of a quick shelter? Use a poncho to make a tent. Find that your regular tent is resting on some particularly soggy ground? Lay out your poncho as a ground sheet. This guide will help you match your weather protection needs to the poncho that will suit you best.</p>",154
290,carbon fiber wallet,"<p>Imagine the perfect date. A quiet, candlelit dinner at a five-star restaurant with a jaw-dropping view from your table. A five-course meal with caviar, a perfectly cooked filet mignon, and crème brûlée for desert. Finally, it comes time to pay. You cringe. The scratching of Velcro as you open your ratty nylon wallet shatters the entire mood of the evening. Sure, the thing is practical and lightweight, but it lacks the versatility of a truly sophisticated wallet - a carbon fiber wallet. When your world swings from one extreme to the other, you need a wallet that will do it all. A carbon fiber wallet provides you with a tough, durable cash carrier that won't weigh you down, yet this stylish option is sure to stand out when you need to dress to the nines. </p><p>No matter what the situation, a carbon fiber wallet is the perfect financial wingman. Here's how to pick yours.</p>",154
243,binoculars under 100,"<p>A great pair of binoculars will help you absorb our infinite escape from the hassles of everyday life. Of course, I'm talking about nature. Whether you're a hunter, wildlife ranger, or merely a casual enthusiast who enjoys the fresh air and encapsulating vistas, anyone can reap the benefits of some quality sight glasses. That said, they can get quite lofty in terms of price, and it can be a headache to snag a decent pair at the right price. That's no problem for us, so allow us to lend a helping hand.</p><p>Welcome to our buyer's guide to the best binoculars for less than $100. We've got you covered, from leviathan-sized star gazers to rugged companions for hunting and everything in between. Whatever outdoor pastime floats your boat, there's a product for you here.

301,gaiter mask,"<p>Whether you are into hiking, camping, backpacking, fishing, hunting, skiing, biking, ATV riding, or UTV riding, one piece of equipment that can come in handy is a high-quality gaiter mask. Gaiter masks are extremely useful for protecting your neck from the sun, keeping you warm in colder weather conditions, and protecting your face from breathing in any dust, dirt, or debris. Gaiter masks are available in a wide variety of different styles, sizes, colors, and some models even come with reusable filters for maximum protection. You should always consider using some type of face and neck protection, particularly when biking or riding your ATV at high speeds on remote trails. </p><p>Whether you are looking for great value, durability, versatility, or reliability, we took a look at the best gaiter masks currently on the market.

47,edc flashlights,"<p>How many times have you found yourself wishing you had skipped that cheap EDC flashlight your buddy brags about every time you visit the PX? Sure, you saved some cash, but looking back now, you should have known better than to listen to a desk jockey talking up his first EDC light. Anyone can see something cool, buy it, and swear by it, but EDC gear needs to be tough and reliable. When it comes to choosing potentially life-saving gear, never compromise. You would never trust your life to a parachute rigged by someone without the red hat, so why would you trust a light with a name without a solid reputation? Sure, you might get lucky once, but when the chips are down, why gamble again?</p><p>To that end, we've rounded up some of the best EDC flashlights on the market. Take a gander and see which one is right for you.</p>",152
154,rifle cases,"<p>There are plenty of options for rifle cases in the world. Sure, you can throw your rifle in a shopping bag or a tennis racket case, like some people. And as cool as that looks in that one low-budget John Wick knockoff you saw that one time, it doesn't do much to protect your rifle in transit. That's why I took the time out of my day to sit down with the cases I own and what the market offers to narrow down the best options for you and what you need.</p><p>We've lined up some of the best rifle cases on the market today to help you sort through the nonsense and make the right purchase. A good gun case isn't just going to be a bag to stuff your rifle into, it will protect it in transit, support accessories, and carry your mags - and more - without breaking the bank.</p>",152
250,camping cots,"<p>What's the difference between camping and spending a week in the field? Well, for starters, you can get more than two hours of sleep without being woken up for firewatch. You can cook up bacon and eggs instead of destroying your digestive system with the failed chemical experiment that is MRE cheese. Perhaps most importantly, you can find a comfortable place to sleep without fighting with other people for the most ergonomically supportive patch of dirt to lay on. Camping by foot will limit you to foam or inflatable sleeping pads, but driving to the campsite opens up a world of possibilities. By equipping your tent or cabin with a camping cot, you can sleep better and wake up ready for another day of hiking, hunting, or releasing your inner Henry David Thoreau.</p><p>We found camping cots ranging from classic to contemporary, so dig in and find a better way to sleep outdoors.</p>",152
326,backpacking water filters,"<p>When traveling through the backcountry, water is life, and knowing where to find water and how to purify or filter water are essential wilderness skills. At 8.34 pounds per gallon, water is also one of the heaviest things to strap on your back, so being able to replenish water along the way lightens your load and extends how far you can travel. In an emergency or survival situation, being able to access safe water could mean the difference between life and death, as humans can go about three weeks without food but only three days without water. Water is life, and you never want to be caught without it.</p><p>There are a lot of portable water filters and purifiers on the market, so we reviewed the best backpacking water filters out of all of them to help you make the purchase that's right for you. Shop smart and stay hydrated - or else.</p>",152
350,camping grills,"<p>I'll admit to not using a camping grill for a long time. I was a practicing member of the American Society for Clif Bars and Jetboil Ramen. As a result, my off-grid nutrition was adequate, but not the kind of thing you'd get excited about.</p><p>That's when I discovered the overland craze. I saw people whipping out grills and cooking ribeye, fresh vegetables, and the earthly heaven that is a cast-iron-skillet cobbler. Goodness gracious. Suddenly, a camping grill appeared very high on my list of priorities.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you prefer gas, charcoal, or wood; there's a grill out there that can transform your camping experience. These portable grills are designed to be relatively compact and easy to transport without making a mess of your car or RV like the hibachis of the past. They won't just make you like campsite cooking more-they might make it your preferred way to prepare a meal.</p>",152
356,camping accessories upgrade,"<p>If you're lucky enough to go camping in your free time, you're also lucky enough to choose your own equipment. Sure, our ancestors camped under the stars with nothing but a rock for a pillow, but they also died of exposure or got run over in their sleep by a wild boar at the ripe old age of 15. You can do better. Once you have the essentials taken care of, you can start looking for ways to upgrade your camping experience – especially if you're traveling in a vehicle rather than on foot. With a few key purchases, you can eat better, sleep more comfortably, and bring your favorite playlist - all while maximizing your camping budget. That sounds like a wilderness oasis you'll never want to leave.</p><p>Here are a few items that strike the perfect balance between civilization and frontier survival. You might even have money left over for provisions.</p>",152
380,rifle cases,"<p>There are plenty of options for rifle cases in the world. Sure, you can throw your rifle in a shopping bag or a tennis racket case, like some people. And as cool as that looks in that one low-budget John Wick knockoff you saw that one time, it doesn't do much to protect your rifle in transit. That's why I took the time out of my day to sit down with the cases I own and what the market offers to narrow down the best options for you and what you need.</p><p>We've lined up some of the best rifle cases on the market today to help you sort through the nonsense and make the right purchase.

57,6 person tents,"<p>Are you sick of cramming your entire family into small tents with overlapping sleeping pads and gear packed in every nook and cranny? Well, we're here to help you take your camping experience to the next level with the best six-person tents. With ample space, six-person tents are great for big groups - and even a couple dogs. But, you'll want to do a little research first, before picking out a tent of this size.<br/><br/>In this review, we've reviewed a variety of tents, from dome-shaped to cabin tents, to determine the best six-person tent for a variety of missions. We found tents well-suited for glamping and others good for three-season camping. Some have enormous vestibules (the camping equivalent of a ""mudroom""), while others have open, mesh exteriors for stargazing. While you'll want to look elsewhere if you want a lightweight backpacking tent, these six-person tents will meet all your backcountry needs.</p>",151

239,safety glasses,"<p>When you realize you have a full life to live still, why hold back? Whether you hope to travel around the world in 80 days on the back of your Kawasaki, plan to turn your blacksmithing hobby into a full-time career, or simply make your living by mixing chemicals day in and day out, nothing is more valuable than your eyesight. When sparks start flying and you've got a deadline to meet, the last thing you need on your mind is keeping those sparks out of your face so you can keep your eye on the prize. Whether you work inside or outside, whether you wear prescription lenses or not, proper eye protection is no area for compromise. </p><p>Luckily, there are plenty of options out there, perfectly designed for just about any activity you could ever imagine. So, don a pair of safety glasses and show the world who's boss.</p>",150
254,survival backpacks,"<p>In an emergency, a properly equipped survival backpack may be all that stands between life and death. Survival is a simple task that has become surprisingly difficult for the modern American. When chaos rules the day, obtaining food, water, warmth, and shelter become disastrously difficult for the unprepared. Throw in a medical emergency or an aggressive predator, and a miniature apocalypse can demolish your chances of survival. However, the trained and equipped individual with the right mindset (and quality gear) can overcome all.</p><p>While these packs do share some overlap with bug out bags, go bags, and EDC bags, a dedicated survival backpack is loaded with everything you need to survive a given situation and nothing more.

354,coffee makers accessories,"<p>Coffee might just be hot bean water, but it takes a surprising amount of finesse to get it just right. You're probably better off with a morning Monster than the syrup-based swill you'll find at the gas station, and the good stuff usually comes with an inflated price and an atmosphere that's just a little too hipster. It would be better if you could get great coffee, brewed just the way you like it, in the comfort of your own home - and with a small investment and a few adjustments to your morning routine, you can have it all.</p><p>One or two carefully chosen purchases can have you sipping espresso or stockpiling cold brew like a pro. Each style of coffee has its own tools, and all it takes is a little practice to be proficient with them. Here are six that can turn you into a connoisseur of caffeine.</p>",150

274,gym bags,"<p>You know the drill, literally: the demands of both the field and the gym require supplies that can keep up. Whether you train in the gym or by running laps, you need a gym bag that can store all your supplies. Water. Change of clothes. Shoes. Your wallet and pocket knife. A snack. The needs just keep adding up. And don't just go with any old backpack - you need something that will let your post-workout gear breathe, but is also tough enough to support tactical gear without busting at the seams.

The best gun belts do this through the use of superior materials, innovative designs, and rock-solid quality control.</p><p>We've compiled a list of our top picks in the various categories that are encompassed under the general moniker of ""gun belts.""

Whether you choose a compact hand-crank radio you can carry with you or a solar-powered larger model to keep in your home or car kit, you have to have a radio you can rely on. When disaster strikes and you find yourself in a survival setting, your radio will go farther than your smartphone. Radios, both regular radios and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather radios, will relay critical emergency information. Radios are more reliable than smartphones, as you'll always be able to get a signal; radio waves also travel farther than LTE. When cell phone lines are jammed or down, your radio will be your only connection to updates. </p><p>If you're searching for just the right survival radio, there are plenty of options available.

159,uv flashlights,"<p>Just because you can't see it with the naked eye doesn't mean the danger isn't there - and that applies whether you're at home or in a filthy barracks somewhere. UV flashlights enhance your ability to observe and identify risks, especially bodily fluids. Since fluids like blood and urine are a biohazard, it's important to know when they are around; under ultraviolet light, these fluids glow so you can spot them in an instant. While it can't tell you if there is a specific pathogen in your environment, a UV light can tell you the risk is there.</p><p>When it comes to health and safety, it's very important to ensure the quality of the tools you're using, especially if you can't rely on your basic senses for a full assessment.

227,two way radio,"<p>Communication is key, especially when it comes to survival situations. You could be exploring new terrain, tracking down a target, or just be well out of cell range. Whatever the circumstances, two-way radios ensure that you can always touch base with your crew. Of course, not all radios are made alike. When it comes to maintaining a tactical advantage, you need something that's durable, with a powerful battery and a broad range. While most two-way radios look similar, finding something that can work in the most strenuous settings is both an art and a science. Just imagine how long The Longest Day could have been had U.S. troops not been using quality tech. </p><p>So, to save you time and make it easier to choose the best two-way radios around, we've detailed the leading options.

283,kerosene heaters,"<p>Temperatures drop, but your zeal for home improvement projects doesn't. Good on you. Garages, workshops, and job sites aren't always the most forgiving places to be, and bundling up like the little brother in A Christmas Story can only do so much. You might be better off adding a heater to your repertoire and letting a can of kerosene take the frost out of the air. Compared to electric space heaters, kerosene heaters produce significantly more heat. They're also surprisingly efficient. Just a gallon of kerosene can keep you warm for hours. There are a few considerations to keep in mind, like high temperatures and fumes that require adequate ventilation, but those are easy to account for.</p><p>When you're ready to take your winter projects to the next level, pick up a can of fuel and one of these kerosene heaters. You'll be up and running in no time.</p>",148

28,hunting backpacks,"<p>Light in, heavy out. That's the way a good hunt goes. Pack in the basics and pack out a truckload of meat. Of course, your truck may be miles away, so a quality hunting backpack is more than just a nicety. That trophy moose isn't going anywhere unless YOU pack it to the truck yourself.</p><p>Often, the best game is the hardest to reach. Whether you're chasing New Mexico elk or the mountain goats of Montana, the best way in is on foot, and what you don't pack in, you'll never have on hand. Like hardcore backpackers, dedicated hunters need a dedicated bag to pack in their gear, but unlike hikers, successful hunters will have a harvest far heavier than most backpackers will ever dream of hauling. This makes the best hunting backpacks one-of-a-kind pieces of equipment with plenty of design features no other outdoorsman would ever need.</p>",147
130,military lego sets,"<p>Let's take a quick break from the workday to revisit one of our favorite childhood toys. Lego is stepping back from military-themed toys for some reason, but there are still a few sets out there and plenty of competitors are picking up their slack (it turns out plastic rectangles aren't that hard to make).I took it upon myself to wade into the military toy segment to bring you a follow-up to our informative and totally serious Nerf gear guide. I present to you the most representative and entertaining Lego sets for each branch of the U.S. military. I found something that soldiers, sailors, Marines, coasties, airmen, and guardians (sorry, but how the hell did ""startans"" and ""floaty bois"" get vetoed?) can all have a laugh at. </p><p>Next time you have a gift exchange with your interservice buddies, you can thank us for doing the legwork for you.</p>",147
147,zoom binoculars,"<p>There are a lot of ways to extend your vision. Binoculars, spotting scopes, and rifle optics can all be incredibly useful in the field. Hunters and bird-watchers alike have long used binoculars to see into the distance and burn through brush. If there's one downside to this kind of gear, it's the potential to spend a lot of money on specialized equipment that performs in a relatively narrow range of environments.</p><p>Zoom binoculars, also known as variable-power binoculars, earned their share of the optics market by proving their versatility. With magnification capabilities as low as eight power and as high as 125 power, zoom binoculars can serve as your one-stop-shop for extended vision. They might not be quite as clear as fixed-power binoculars, but the tradeoff is one you should definitely consider. Add in the compelling price of these binoculars, and you've got a great piece of gear.</p>",147
310,hiking watch,"<p>Punctuality is always important - even if you're hiking in the wilderness.

86,water rowing machines,"<p>One of the more interesting niches in the fitness world is that of water rowing machines, or hydro rowers. Anyone who has done CrossFit has become intimate with rowing machines and knows how intense a rowing workout can be. Rowing is a full-body strength exercise that has a cardio aspect, too. That's what makes rowing a great addition to any workout regimen. It can even help with arthritic back pain, as a low resistance workout in the mornings can help grease the gears and loosen everything up.</p><p>Picking a water rower for your gym is about adding a different type of resistance to your workouts.

167,survival watch,"<p>The sun hangs low in the arctic sky. Growing weary from exposure to the elements, you lose track of time as days become weeks. You check your survival watch. It's time to eat some marmot jerky, face outboard, change your socks, and carry on.</p><p>I'm not saying that exact scenario is going to happen, but you'd feel pretty dumb if it did and you didn't have a watch to remind you about marmot-eating time after I specifically warned you. What makes a good survival watch? Reliability is the main thing. Fragile gear has no place in your survival kit. Beyond that, there are a few strategies you can use. GPS watches offer the most technology and features. Automatic watches free you from worrying about your battery going dead.

Kettlebells, which come in an array of sizes and weights, provide a total body workout while allowing you to subtly improve your core strength.

343,fitness equipment,"<p>So, you want to get strong. What are you doing about it? Hopefully, you've built a program based on real science rather than bro science; more Jim Wendler and less of the fitness magazines at the checkout counter. An effective workout plan starts with homework, gains traction with proper form, and certainly benefits from arming yourself with the right tools. Don't be fooled into thinking that your cross-trainers and a $5 protein shake from the front desk are all you need to reach your potential. Seek out the strongest lifters at your gym, and you'll notice they all have the same fitness equipment in their gym bag. They probably all read the same studies and watch the same videos, too.</p><p>When you're ready to start treating your gym bag like a tool box, be sure to make your money count by considering a few of these essentials.</p>",146

Yes, we're sure you could cut on the countertop or some plate from the cupboard, but really, only amateurs take those kinds of shortcuts. Slicing through linoleum or mutilating the wife's favorite dishes won't do you or your pocketbook much good. A popsicle on an August sidewalk at Fort Huachuca will outlast your dream of becoming the base pitmaster. Plan ahead, and get a cutting board.</p>",145

While you could accomplish the same tasks with whatever you got in your toolbox, you risk damaging your guns and saying a few words you might later regret.</p><p>In this guide, we focus on gunsmithing tool sets because unless you're a professional-level armorer, a general gunsmithing tool set will suit your needs.

205,duffel bags,"<p>Duffel bags are practically a way of life for athletes and the military alike. The large capacity and convenience of duffel bags are what made them popular in the first place. Originally named for the specific type of fabric they were made from, duffel bags were adopted by the military during the World Wars and enhanced thereafter to become the standard issue sea bag. Just for fun: Show any Marine a picture of a mountain of sea bags and watch them cringe.</p><p>Traditionally, duffel bags were shapeless woolen bags with rope drawstrings that held a lot of gear, but were difficult to carry.

214,ankle weights,"<p>If you have limited space in your house or you don't want to spend a ton of money on home gym equipment, ankle weights are a great solution. Leg weights help you get the most out of bodyweight exercises like leg lifts, chin-ups, a variety of core exercises, and even low-intensity workouts like yoga.There's also not much to them: they're just weighted straps for your ankles.

253,cigar humidors,"<p>Old-school cigar shops feel like stepping into another time. Being surrounded by dark-stained hardwood and leather batwing chairs can make us all feel more like James Bond than our chain-smoking uncle. Wouldn't it be nice to have that experience at home? Imagine ushering your guests into a walk-in humidor filled with exotic cigars from around the world. Sure, that would be great, but it's pretty unrealistic. That doesn't mean you can't create a scaled-down version of that experience by popping the lid on your own personal humidor. If you enjoy a cigar every now and then, treat it right and keep it fresh. Otherwise, you might as well be puffing on a flavored smoke from the gas station.</p><p>Upgrade your special occasion stogies with a cigar humidor from our collection of favorites.</p>",131
262,handheld gps,"<p>A handheld GPS unit can be a tremendous asset in the field, but you'd better know what you're doing if you're going to use one effectively. That starts with understanding the basics of what makes them tick and how to navigate without one.</p><p>The GPS (Global Positioning System) network includes 31 satellites owned by the United States. Alternative networks include China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, the European Union's Galileo system, Russia's GLONASS, India's IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) and NavIC (Navigation Indian Constellation), and Japan's QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System).</p><p>We found reliable devices that tap into a variety of these networks to bring you accurate, dependable location data all over the world.

334,rechargeable flashlight,"<p>We may not use flashlights all that often, but they're critical when we do need them. Most of us have a few old-school flashlights stashed away with batteries that haven't held electricity in ages. That's a problem for two reasons. First of all, you're putting yourself in position to not have a working flashlight in a dire moment. Second, you're throwing money away every time you replace batteries that discharged most of their energy over time. You can solve both problems with a rechargeable flashlight. No more searching for the right size of battery, no more overpaying for batteries, and no more dim flashlights letting you down.</p><p>We found several options that you should consider.

264,slip joint knives,"<p>Among the overwhelming selection of possible EDC knives on today's market, the classic slip joint knife has gotten lost in the shuffle. Sadly, many people's first knife uses anything but this simple, easy-to-use design for fear of being ""bitten"" by a blade without a mechanical lock. While grandpa may have never owned a smartphone, he certainly knew his way around knives, and there are plenty of reasons why he always kept a handy slip joint in his pocket. Uncle Sam may no longer be issuing folding knives to the majority of U.S. troops these days, but you can bet your challenge coin that the Joes at Anzio and Chosin had their trusty slip joint knife handy should the need arise, because sometimes, a Ka-Bar is overkill, even for a Marine.</p>",130
288,rangefinders,"<p>No one is questioning your ability to estimate range by referencing your ACSS reticle or imagining how many football fields could fit between you and the target, but we might suggest that a rangefinder could improve your shooting. Hunting and recreational shooting require you to account for things like wind, humidity, and temperature - not to mention the type and consistency of ammunition you're using. Maintaining thorough notes for data on previous engagements is important, and you can make those notes a lot more accurate by using actual ranges rather than estimated ones.</p><p>Even NASA engineers use calculators, and you should take advantage of available technology, too. A proper rangefinder can take your shot placement from accurate to dead-on balls accurate (it's an industry term) in the blink of an eye.</p>",130
336,hiking socks,"<p>Hiking can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors, provided you're equipped with the right gear. Tough, versatile socks are definitely one of the most essential things to have on hand. Every prepared hiker has a spare pair of socks in their gear.

That's why I put together this guide of the best tactical pants for 2022.</p><p>As a firearms instructor, I wear tactical pants designed for my needs like running, gunning, and teaching.

170,backpack brands,"<p>As kids, finding the best backpack brands came down to which ones had our favorite cartoon characters on them. These days, it's a little more complicated. You probably have specialized gear for life in the military, camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, school, and travel. It only makes sense that your backpack would be purpose-built, too.<br/>Buying into a quality brand saves you from buyer's remorse. It also saves money in the long term and keeps gear out of the landfill because you can rely on a solid pack to last many years. Of all the manufacturers out there, I picked what I consider to be the best backpack brands in several categories and chose one model that you can buy to take full advantage of everything each brand has to offer.</p>",129

They're sleek showpieces, razor-sharp deterrents, and masterfully elegant tools when placed in equally-masterful hands.</p><p>Fancying yourself a butterfly knife of your own?

358,running headphones,"<p>Whether you are a marathon runner or a casual jogger, you're going to need a good pair of running headphones to listen to your favorite pump-up playlist. In recent years, with the introduction of Apple AirPods, many headphone companies have abandoned their cords and gone completely wireless.

(Why couldn't the Chinese have invented an explosive charge that cleans up with a quick rinse from a garden hose? Seriously, what were y'all thinking?!) Fortunately, a good gun cleaning kit can make the experience easier and maybe a little more tolerable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are tons of different gun cleaning kits, but they all seem to have overlapping similarities.

188,hiking shorts,"<p>Whether you're new to hiking or a seasoned trekker, it's vital to wear the proper clothing so you don't get chafed or soaking wet from sweat. In addition to the right footwear, socks, pants, and shirts, you may want to invest in a comfortable yet functional pair of hiking shorts. While they provide less coverage than pants, they're a good option if you plan on spending the day in hot and humid conditions.</p><p>Unfortunately, not all hiking shorts are created equal.

199,hardshell jackets,"<p>People who know their way around the backcountry dress in layers, and that all starts with the best hardshell jacket for the job.

322,solar phone chargers,"<p>Thanks to cell phones, we can now walk around with the cumulative knowledge of humanity in the palm of our hand. The problem is that, once you venture out from the world of wall outlets and 12-volt car outlets, our phones have a very limited lifespan. If you plan on camping, hiking, or doing serious off-grid travel, stopping to charge your phone may not be an option. To keep all those apps, maps, and your camera handy, you'd better pick up a solar charger. These handy devices take up very little room, and can keep your phone and other devices charged anywhere there's sunlight.</p><p>Take a look at our list of go-to solar phone chargers and keep those electronics charged with the power of the sun itself.</p>",126

91,1911 holsters,"<p>The 1911 pistol is one of the longest-running service weapons in military history. It's rugged, accurate, and packs a massive punch.

104,tactical watches,"<p>Tactical watches are a difficult category to define, simply because unlike things like solar watches or dive watches, there's no specific quality that makes them tactical.

Unlike a mechanical watch, a quartz watch is battery-powered, so instead of constantly winding it, you change the battery every few years. Today, the best quartz watches are solar-powered.</p><p>Solar technology has improved significantly over the years.

102,shooting mats,"<p>As any hunter or rifleman will tell you, a considerable amount of time can pass between setting up in your hide and breaking the perfect shot at your quarry. More often than not, that time is spent lying prone somewhere cold, damp, and muddy. Far from being a mere creature comfort, a quality shooting mat can help you maintain a better state of readiness and keep your focus on the task at hand.</p><p>In this article, we group shooting mats into two categories: field and range. Field mats are lightweight and easily carried into the backcountry, but are more austere than range mats which are ideal for shooting at established facilities or when operating in close proximity to a vehicle.</p>",119

255,backpacking tents,"<p>In the world of long-distance backpacking, we're super concerned about weight, especially with backpacking tents. Your tent is one of the ""big three"" items you carry in terms of weight - the other two being your sleep system and your backpack itself. As the old minimalist saying goes: Less is more. Less weight is more distance, more enjoyment, and also more cost.</p><p>Backpacking tents are generally classified around two main characteristics: the number of sleepers, or capacity, and the weather conditions they will be used in. Three-season tents are generally designed for spring, summer, and fall use, while four-season tents tend to be made out of more rugged materials to withstand winter snow and high winds on mountains.</p>",117
