1,fire starter,"<h2>Types of fire starters</h2><p>Starting a fire is simple; you need air, fuel, and spark. There are several ways to go about this. Air is a given. Fuel can come in the form of logs, charcoal, or propane, but you'll need quality tinder to get the main event kicked off. The spark can be created using friction, fuel, or electricity. What works in the backyard fire pit might not always be sufficient in a survival situation. Feel free to find the right combination for you.</p><h3>Friction</h3><p>The most basic way to start a fire (aside from being in the right place at the right time during a lightning storm) is with a good old-fashioned bow drill. You can theoretically do the same thing freehand, but it takes way more effort and the likelihood of success is low. Ferro rods make the process easier by replacing wood with steel and combustible ferrocerium.</p><p>This is probably the most rewarding way to start a fire because it takes the most skill. The principles can also be put to use with a homemade bow drill or flint and steel in an emergency, so you can take comfort in building a lifelong skill. Just be prepared to spend a significant amount of time learning how to use these tools effectively.</p><h3>Fuel</h3><p>Yes, lighters that run on fuel still require spark. In a Zippo, for example, you still create sparks by turning the friction wheel with your thumb. The difference is that fuel is carried internally, so you don't have to transfer those sparks to your tinder. Once lit, liquid fuel will continue to burn in a controlled manner until you shut off the supply.</p><p>This is the most common style of lighter. It's light, portable, reliable, and inexpensive. Lighter fluid burns well even when it's raining or cold, and is fairly resistant to wind. The drawback is having to refill the lighter fluid frequently. Disposable lighters are cheap, but you get what you pay for and you're better off buying a quality lighter from the start.</p><h3>Electricity</h3><p>Rather than storing lighter fluid, plasma lighters use electricity to generate enough heat to cause tinder to combust. This approach is clean, reliable, and sustainable. Instead of relying on a supply of lighter fluid, you can plug one of these into a portable solar panel and have quick, convenient access to fire indefinitely.</p><p>Durable, waterproof bodies and compact batteries make this style of lighter a compelling option for any survival kit. Solar charging gives them the potential to be your most sustainable option, but plan ahead and buy a solar panel and battery backup to set yourself up for success.</p>",432.0
2,metal detectors,"<h2>Types of metal detectors</h2><p>Metal detectors span a huge variety of sizes, prices, and capabilities. At the little end of the spectrum are pinpoint metal detectors, and at the opposite end are the commercial-grade metal detectors that can be found in large-scale search operations. For this gear guide, we wanted to focus on products that any one of us could afford and comfortably put to use. Tech Metals Research has a fantastic in-depth breakdown of these categories if you want more information.</p><h3>Very low frequency</h3><p>Most recreational metal detectors use very low frequency signals to locate metal objects underground. These signals interact with the magnetic fields of a piece of metal and produce an audible tone, a visible indicator, or both. Simple technology results in a very affordable price. VLF metal detectors are also user-friendly, making them a great choice for beginners.</p><p>The drawback of this style is a limited signal that sometimes struggles to discern between different kinds of feedback. Certain soil types can generate interference that produces false positives. For the money, though, that's a compromise we're happy to make. If you're getting into metal detecting for fun or to do small projects around the house, there's nothing wrong with purchasing a VLF metal detector. This is what you'll find in this gear guide.</p><h3>Multi-frequency</h3><p>Higher up the price range are multi-frequency metal detectors. Rather than the single frequency used by VLF metal detectors, these broaden their output to more effectively search for objects of different sizes in different locations. It's important to know that not all multi-frequency metal detectors offer the same capabilities. Many scan all their frequencies simultaneously, while selectable-frequency metal detectors allow the operator to choose which ones to use in any given situation. Think of that as refining search criteria.</p><p>This sophistication does come with a significant jump in price, so these are best left to more experienced hobbyists. If you have room in your budget and the time to practice with one of these, more power to you.</p><h3>Pulse induction</h3><p>Pulse induction metal detectors benefit from a much more refined signal that offers improved performance in challenging terrains like soil with high mineral content and the salty sand at the beach. Rather than a continuous output, these metal detectors fire individual signals hundreds of times every second and interpret the feedback they get from each one. This also allows them to reach depths beyond what you could search with other metal detectors.</p><p>These capabilities make pulse induction metal detectors very popular among people searching for gold or scanning the beach. The advantages are significant and impressive, but the cost is enough to keep them out of reach for most amateurs.</p>",437.0
3,stainless steel cookware,"<h2>Types of stainless steel cookware</h2><p>In addition to the benefits of stainless steel, some cookware incorporates additional features to stand out from the crowd. Which is best for you will depend on your cooking (and cleaning) preferences.</p><h3>Purely stainless steel</h3><p>Stainless steel is so well-suited for cooking that you don't have to complicate the formula to get great cookware. It's conductive, consistent, easy to clean, and tougher than nails. High-end cookware is built to be hefty for better heat distribution.</p><p>Without any other materials, all-stainless steel cookware is as durable as it gets. Use metal spoons and spatulas. Scrub away without worrying about scratches. Throw it in the dishwasher. This style of cookware makes cooking a delight and cleanup a breeze.</p><p>You can find this type of stainless steel cookware at a range of prices, and there are even options designed for outdoor use.</p><h3>Additional metals</h3><p>As good as stainless steel is, some cooks prefer other metals that distribute heat from the stove to the rest of the pot or pan quickly, so you can get cooking in less time. Some stainless steel cookware is designed with an aluminum or copper base to get the best of both worlds. These more conductive metals are only present on the bottom.</p><p>While aluminum and copper are superior heat conductors, they are also softer. That means they scratch easily, so you'll need to be more careful with them. Copper is also very susceptible to discoloration, so you'll need to scour it frequently to keep it looking its best. Over time, you can actually wear all the way through.</p><p>Weigh the advantages and disadvantages to pick what's best for you.</p><h3>Coatings</h3><p>Stainless steel is easy to clean, but non-stick coatings are just about effortless. Some stainless steel pots and pans incorporate these slick coatings so you can spend more time enjoying your meal and less time side-eying the cheese that's hardening to your cookware. If you tend to cook dishes that are hard to clean up, a non-stick coating could be for you.</p><p>Remember that these coatings are not as durable as stainless steel. They do lose efficacy over time and can be easily scratched. To get the most out of a non-stick coated surface, avoid using metal spoons and spatulas. Wash carefully with a soft sponge. Even though these surfaces are somewhat delicate, they can last years if taken care of properly.</p>",387.0
4,tactical gloves,"<h2>Types of tactical gloves</h2><p>Picking out the right pair of tactical gloves is all about planning ahead. Think about where you are most likely to use them. Is it on the shooting range? Surviving the wilderness? In a fistfight? By figuring out where you plan to use the gloves, you can identify the type that will most match your needs.</p><h3>Full-finger shooting gloves</h3><p>Used in law enforcement and the military, full-finger gloves offer the highest level of protection. By avoiding exposed skin, you can more easily protect yourself. It's a lot easier to get cut or scratched without protection, and the full-finger design gives you a layer of security. These gloves are usually made out of more than one material. Typically, it includes leather (either natural or artificial), polyester, and microfiber. Higher-quality models also include a kevlar layer, though this adds to their weight.</p><p>Where full-finger shooting gloves shine is in the overall grip and design of the trigger fingers. The gloves — both the fingers and palms — are meant to give you a good grip. For shooting, these fingers have extra flexibility, making it easier to bend the joint. Finally, this type of glove has thinner fingertips to let you feel your surroundings more easily.</p><h3>Fingerless tactical gloves</h3><p>There are situations where you need to protect your whole hand. Other times call for all the dexterity you can get. Fingerless gloves are the type of tactical gear for the latter circumstance.</p><p>Made out of the same material as full-finger gloves, these offer wrist protection. Attaching to the top part of your wrist, the gloves help to keep you stabilized. The palm cover lends to better grip and prevents issues like rope burn and other abrasions. The material rises to just above your knuckles, leaving the middle joint on your finger open.</p><p>By leaving the fingers open, two benefits come to light. The first is that the gloves breathe better. Your hands can stay dry and at a comfortable, cool temperature more easily. Plus, since you can feel surfaces, you literally get tactile and tactical advantages.</p><h3>Touchscreen-compatible tactical gloves</h3><p>It's no secret that communication is a massive part of any tactical maneuver, and in current times, that means your smartphone. From location-tracking via GPS on your devices to basics like making an emergency call, you need to be able to use your phone quickly. Touchscreen-compatible tactical gloves let you control the screen without removing your gear.</p><p>Eliminating issues with the reliability of voice commands on your phone, these gloves incorporate metal in the textile. Usually either aluminum or copper, these fibers can run a current (like your bare skin does). The fingertips of the gloves incorporate the metal so you can use your phone. Since it is woven into the regular fabric, there isn't a scratching risk on the screen.</p>",460.0
5,tactical sunglasses,"<h2>Types of tactical sunglasses</h2><h3>Interchangeable lens kit</h3><p>Beyond the basic single-lens offerings on today's market, you will fit a number of tactical sunglasses kits which come with a collection of interchangeable lenses and a single pair of frames. Most often, these kits will include a non-polarized set of lenses without any polarization and one or two additional pairs of lenses: clear and/or low-light (yellow, amber, copper, etc.). Oftentimes, replacement lenses are available from the manufacturer, so if glare is an issue, you can always supplement your kit with a new pair of polarized lenses.</p><h3>Prescription sunglasses</h3><p>Some of the best tactical operators in the world couldn't hit the broadside of a barn without their prescription lenses. Ok, so maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but sometimes prescription tactical sunglasses are an absolute must-have. Sure, there are options that will fit over traditional eyeglasses or you could settle for wearing contacts with regular ol' sunglasses, but let's face it: Tactical environments are not particularly forgiving of either solution. As such, investing in a pair of prescription shades with the ballistic performance to keep you in the fight. The only downside with this solution is the extra cost and the need to order from either the manufacturer or the optician.</p><h3>‘Asian fit'</h3><p>The human body is simultaneously uniform and unique, and the same goes for our facial structure. Most standard tactical sunglasses are designed around the dimensions of the average Caucasian face shape, but ballistic shades made to these specs are not well-suited to fit many individuals of East Asian or Pacific Rim heritage. As such, many ethnically Asian or Pacific Islander individuals (and a few others) need a pair of ballistic sunglasses with a proper nose bridge, lens shape, and frame curvature to accommodate their face shape in such a way as to provide adequate protection from both sun and debris. Many brands offer Asian fit sunglasses, although a number of them use different descriptors, such as omni fit, universal fit, or low bridge fit to name a few. For a more thorough rundown on the topic, check out this helpful article from SportRx.</p>",348.0
6,tritium watches,"<h2>Types of tritium watches</h2><p>Tritium watches are popular for good reason, and there are types and styles for just about any occasion. Tactical tritium watches are worthy of nighttime combat operations. Formal tritium watches look fantastic at a club or paired with a suit and tie. Dive watches are backed by breathtaking precision. We wouldn't be surprised if your first purchase becomes the beginning of a collection.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tritium has long been a staple in the world of tactical gear. It's used in lensatic compasses to aid in night land navigation. Firearms have incorporated tritium into their night sights for decades. It only makes sense that you'd want this technology in your watch.</p><p>Tritium is placed into watches in the form of tiny vials, or tubes, rather than being painted on in a liquid form. With vials marking the hands and face, you can easily keep track of time without lighting up a digital screen or giving away your position with a flashlight. Tritium is also compatible with night vision optics.</p><h3>Formal</h3><p>Just because you want the practicality of a watch face that's visible at night doesn't mean you have to limit yourself to watches designed for a combat zone. Formal tritium watches add luminous technology to stylish timepieces fit for a night on the town. Careful design integrates luminous vials into timeless watch faces beautifully.</p><p>Popular brands like Invicta offer watches that look as great as they perform. Not only can you class up an outfit with a gold or silver watch, but you can also take a midnight swim without worrying about damaging it. That's perfect for all those black-tie affairs (or beach barbeques) you go to.</p><h3>Dive</h3><p>Dive watches are intended for extensive use underwater and are held to a higher standard than other watches. Because of the added water pressure experienced at depth, these watches must adhere to incredibly strict quality standards to prevent malfunction. Divers also expect practical design cues like tritium and large numerals that are easy to read in conditions with poor visibility.</p><p>Because of this build quality, dive watches have also evolved into a bit of a status symbol. Even collectors who never intend to dive appreciate the craftsmanship that goes into a good dive watch and are willing to pay to own one.</p>",372.0
7,10x42 binoculars,"<h2>Types of 10×42 binoculars</h2><p>When it comes to choosing the right pair of 10×42 binoculars, you'll have two primary options. These binoculars come with either a roof prism or Porro prism setup. While these two different types might look almost identical at first glance, the prism option you choose will determine important details, like the weight, capability, and light intake of your binoculars. To decide which is the best fit for you, keep reading to learn about each specific kind.</p><h3>Roof prism</h3><p>Roof prism binoculars feature internal prisms that closely overlap, keeping them tightly-knit and slimmer in shape. Physically, the objective lenses line up directly with the eyepieces for a truly straight-line point of view. This makes roof prism 10×42 binoculars slimmer as a result — they're more streamlined and less bulky than other kinds of binoculars. They also tend to be lighter in weight and more compact in size overall.</p><p>Roof prism binoculars are typically more rugged and durable. Their inner workings may be a bit more complex due to their overlapping prisms, but these binoculars are light and easy to hold under even the roughest conditions. However, they're also often more expensive.</p><h3>Porro prism</h3><p>Porro prism binoculars are the ""original"" style of binoculars. Created as the first modern binocular, it's the kind that most people still purchase today. Inside each pair, prisms are placed in a zig-zag array that's meant to offer better clarity and more three-dimensional images even from great distances. These binoculars tend to be the best choice for wider, larger fields of view; they can do more and offer better images from very far away.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a few drawbacks that come with choosing a pair of Porro prism binoculars. These binoculars are bigger, heavier, and bulkier than their competitors. They aren't as easy to hold or as light to carry over long periods of time. However, if you're all about performance and high-quality images, then Porro makes for the perfect choice.</p>",321.0
8,1000 lumen flashlight,"<h2>Types of 1000 lumen flashlights</h2><p>Though all 1000 lumen flashlights will max out at the same light beam intensity, not all are made alike. Most lights rely on LED technology since it is affordable, compact, and longer-lasting than other bulbs on the market. While you can find all sorts of tactical flashlights and even UV models, the types of 1000 lumen flashlights are differentiated by the power source the flashlights use.</p><h3>Rechargeable battery</h3><p>Easily the most common type of 1000 lumen flashlight, most rechargeable battery lights rely on LED chip technology to create the light beam. You can find models that have removable batteries, similar to a double-A setup that you can charge outside the flashlight. These enable you to switch out the batteries. In some cases, the flashlights enable you to use replaceable batteries, too.</p><p>The more popular design for rechargeable flashlights is with a built-in battery. These connect either via a standard or micro-USB (sometimes both). You can charge them on the go or via a wall socket. Generally speaking, the battery life of rechargeable models is superior to the replaceable counterparts. These flashlights are suitable for times when you know you can restore a charge or are certain you will need it only for a minimal amount of time.</p><h3>Replaceable battery</h3><p>While less common nowadays, replaceable battery flashlights have a lot of advantages. Most rely on a trio of triple-A batteries, located in the shaft of the flashlight itself. Though the batteries are more prone to draining quickly on a high charge, they are easier to replace while you are in transit since you can simply pack spares.</p><p>Most of these flashlights are waterproof and highly durable. So long as batteries aren't left in the flashlight for an extended period, the risk of battery acid leakage is nominal. Coming in a lot of different sizes, the majority of these flashlights are compact, ringing in at under six inches long. These flashlights are suited towards emergency preparation (along with spare batteries) since you can always swap out the power source.</p>",335.0
9,bug out backpack,"<h2>Types of bug-out backpacks</h2><p>There are many different choices when it comes to picking out a tactical bug-out backpack. Depending on whether you need something for rural or urban environments, and based on the type of emergency, you'll need a different type of bag. To up your odds of making it through an emergency unscathed, picking the right bag is essential.</p><h3>72-hour assault bag</h3><p>This is one of the most popular types of bug-out backpacks since getting through the first three days of an emergency is the most critical part. The key to this type of bag is storage capacity. For the bag to be able to support gear for a full three days, it needs to be able to hold at least 40 liters of supplies.</p><p>These bags also need to be able to support sleeping gear by featuring a y-shaped strap on the back. Additionally, this type of bag incorporates room for a hydration pack and often features a holster built-into the bag. Molle mesh is found on just about all of these bags since it enhances storage features. Because these bags require you to plan ahead for a specific type of emergency, it is best when you know what enemy you are likely to face.</p><h3>Go-bag</h3><p>A go-bag is the iconic type of bug-out bag. You keep it by the door so you can grab it and run. As a result, this type of bag needs to be compact, rugged, and waterproof. It should incorporate multiple compartments so you can separate your supplies. In the spirit of bugging-out, this type of bag needs to be able to accommodate a lot of weight.</p><p>Most of these bags are made out of Oxford cloth, a high-density material that isn't prone to rips or tears. With reinforced seams and a lining to keep the contents free of water damage, this type of bag usually has padded straps so that you can stay on the move without getting sore.</p><h3>Survival bag</h3><p>A survival bag is one of the more versatile types of bug-out bags, meant to accommodate all the essential supplies for staying alive. These are easy to plan ahead with since, as long as you've got water, fire, shelter, weapons, and food, you can get through most scenarios. The survival bag will have a medium to large capacity and must be waterproof to qualify.</p><p>Typically, these bags will have several smaller pockets in addition to the interior compartments. Most incorporate a molle system to make it easier to access your gear. You can spot a survival bag by its hydration system, with the majority including a straw set up so you can drink while on the move.</p>",437.0
10,camping canopy,"<h2>Types of camping canopies</h2><p>Though all camping canopies have the same goal — protecting campers from the elements — not all canopies are made alike. Since all environments and weather conditions are different, it's important to figure out which type of camping canopy you need. By opting for the best-suited option, you can optimize the level of protection you receive.</p><h3>Tarp canopy</h3><p>This is perhaps the most versatile type of camping canopy since, in effect, it is a flat piece of material that you can structure however works best for the situation. You can find tarp canopies in all colors and sizes. If you're focused on tactical advantage, opt for something compact and camouflage. Recreational camping may see more benefits from larger tarps, and the color is of less importance.</p><p>The two most important features of a tarp canopy are water resistance and tensile strength. In order to offer suitable protection, it must shield you against the rain and the wind. The durability of the tarp is directly related to the weight it can support, so be sure to choose something suitably strong.</p><h3>Vaulted canopy</h3><p>This type of canopy typically comes with a tent or is built to be an addition to an existing structure. Like the other types of canopy, it must be able to resist moisture and wind. So long as the canopy itself is strong enough, it won't be vulnerable to wind or debris. The vaulted shape adds to this strength since it angles any water or dust away from the top and stops it from building up.</p><p>A vaulted canopy is ideal for casual camping. If it comes with a frame, the vaulted design gives you more room to move around. It's worth noting that, in most cases, it takes more effort to set these canopies up. They are more time-consuming to set up and take down, so it's better to opt for these if you have the time to spare.</p><h3>Curved canopy</h3><p>Often attached to a vehicle, a curved canopy is perhaps one of the most convenient types of camping canopy. Since half of the frame is the vehicle itself, they are fairly easy to set up. Most feature an internal frame (either steel, aluminum, or fibreglass). This curves upwards to give you room to move around and meets legs at the far end. These connect to weights that keep the canopy in place.</p><p>So long as it is sturdy, water-resistant, and able to withstand wind, it should offer suitable protection. The most important thing to look at is the height of the curve at its top point. Be sure that you can comfortably move beneath it, so that the canopy gives you full protection without your needing to crouch.</p>",445.0
11,combat boots,"<h2>Types of combat boots</h2><p>Look past the endless array of shapes and colors, and you'll see that combat boots can be neatly divided into a few categories based on their intended use. A few features separate combat boots for climate, activity, and protection. You almost certainly need more than one, and you might own one of each by the time you're done serving.</p><h3>Jungle boots/moon boots</h3><p>Basic combat boots are sometimes referred to as either jungle boots or moon boots, depending on what type of climate they're built for. It's a good idea to own one of each in good condition at all times.</p><p>Jungle boots are thinner, lighter, and uninsulated. They feature large synthetic panels to create airflow and allow your feet to stay cool in warm environments. Open metal eyelets in the arch areas allow water to drain out, should you need to cross a body of water.</p><p>Moon boots are designed for cold weather. Instead of textiles, they use leather and insulation to keep your body heat inside. Thicker soles raise your feet off the ground to protect you from the cold.</p><h3>Running boots</h3><p>Once the U.S. military started emphasizing functional fitness, exercising in combat boots became standard practice across branches. Unfortunately, most combat boots are lousy to run in.</p><p>Running boots are designed for speed. They weigh very little compared to traditional combat boots and feature soles designed for running rather than rucking. If you want to improve your CFT or O-course time, these are sure to help.</p><p>Because they place a premium on lightness, running combat boots don't hold up well under heavy loads. Wearing them on a field exercise with heavy gear can easily pack out the soles and leave your feet aching. I recommend saving these for PT and timed events.</p><h3>Steel-toe boots</h3><p>Most of you probably don't need steel-toe boots, but some of you need them to do your job. Having adequate protection for your feet is critical to staying mission-ready and preserving your long-term health.</p><p>Uniform regs dictate that you can't just roll into work with a pair of Chippewas on your feet (no matter how awesome they are), so you need to find a protective pair of combat boots like the ones on this list.</p><p>Much like running boots, these are job-specific and shouldn't be worn for other activities like field exercises or PT. Keep them in the shop, where they belong.</p>",389.0
12,damascus knives,"<h2>Types of Damascus knives</h2><h3>Pattern-welded Damascus steel</h3><p>By far the most common way of making Damascus-style steel, this variant is made by forge-welding at least two dissimilar metals together. After they are forge-welded together, they are folded and welded again repeatedly to form an ingot, drawn out and formed into the basic shape of the blade, heat-treated, tempered, and ground; The blade is then dipped in acid to patina the blade and bring out the final pattern of the folded layers of steel. Ferric Chloride acid is frequently used, and 1095 and 15N20 are frequent high carbon steel choices for pattern-welded Damascus, due to the high-nickel content of 15N20 making it patina drastically lighter than 1095, which creates strikingly bold patterns.</p><p>The billet is heated, hammered, and folded repeatedly. The distinct patterns on the blade are created by twisting, folding and drawing out the billet. Overall, the process creates a very strong blade, but its durability is due to the steel alloys that are chosen to create the blade. The pattern in damascus steel is only visually revealed once the steel is cleaned, prepared and etched in acid. The two types of steel react differently in the acid oxidation process. One oxidized steel is lighter and the other is darker, only then is the pattern revealed on the surface that is hidden within the steel.</p><h3>Stainless Damascus</h3><p>Depending on the steels/metals used, Damascus steel can be stainless or not. To become a stainless Damascus both steels must have at least 14% chromium. While the most notable advantage to this is a drastic increase in corrosion resistance, there's typically an increase in quality as well, as this is harder to make than pattern-welded Damascus.</p><h3>Damasteel</h3><p>Damasteel is a modern, innovative take on Damascus steel that utilizes particle metallurgy (PM) to produce extremely high quality stainless Damascus that performs very similarly to CPM154 steel, and has drastically less impurities and inclusions than pattern-welded Damascus. It also features improved toughness and edge retention, courtesy of the PM process. This is the most expensive option, but you get what you pay for.</p>",341.0
13,emergency blanket,"<h2>Types of emergency blankets</h2><h3>Mylar blanket</h3><p>This is easily the most common type of emergency blanket, originally called a space blanket. It is made out of mylar, an aluminum-based material that is lightweight yet not bulky. The blanket is designed to fold down compactly, fit well into any space, and be thoroughly waterproof. The key behind the material is to prevent natural heat loss by reflecting the energy back inwards and trapping it.</p><p>First crafted by NASA, these blankets have become one of the standards for first-aid kits. They feature a plastic coating that keeps the blanket dry and comes in a wide range of sizes (though the bigger they are, the easier they tear). A quality option will be able to reflect back anywhere from 90 to 97 percent of heat, making this type a very energy-efficient option.</p><h3>Sleeping bag</h3><p>Taking mylar technology to the next level, some modern emergency blankets use the metallic features of the blanket in conjunction with insulation. Keep in mind that, because of the extra material, these blankets are bulkier and moderately heavier than their mylar counterparts. In most cases, the blanket is made out of ripstop nylon.</p><p>These blankets are specifically designed for camping or hiking, meant to lend an extra level of security against the elements. In most cases, this type of emergency bag is reusable and generally more comfortable than thinner blankets. Typically, these blankets will come as a standalone.</p>",233.0
14,emergency radio,"<h2>Types of emergency radios</h2><p>Emergency radios have been around for a long time, and their mission has remained the same: to keep people connected when nature brings its worst. Simple backup radios are still available, but more advanced alternatives provide features that can make life easier and enhance your survival kit. Read up on the different options available to see which is best for your needs and budget.</p><h3>Battery-powered radio receivers</h3><p>In their simplest form, emergency radios just need to establish one-way communication from the outside world in the form of a battery-powered radio receiver. You can pull in your local radio stations without worrying about plugging in your radio, connecting to WiFi, or finding cellular service.</p><p>These old-school radios are simple and reliable, but they aren't fancy. You won't get secondary features like flashlights and USB connections to charge other devices. They aren't programmed to automatically broadcast weather advisories from NOAA. On the other hand, they're extremely affordable and easy to operate. This type of emergency radio is great for locations that don't experience extreme weather but might lose power now and then.</p><h3>Sustainable emergency radios</h3><p>Having an emergency radio is great, but what happens when the batteries die? That's a very real possibility if you live in an area that experiences hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods. Being able to generate power can extend the life of your emergency radio far beyond the point when depleted batteries would leave you stranded.</p><p>This list includes options with solar panels that can top off rechargeable batteries inside the emergency radios. Leave them exposed to sunlight to keep power flowing even when batteries and wall outlets aren't available. When sunlight is insufficient, you can turn a hand crank to manually generate electricity. This isn't the easiest or most efficient way to charge a radio, but it's nice to know that you always have access to power, no matter what.</p><h3>Weather radios</h3><p>While all emergency radios have the ability to deliver broadcast messages to you in times of need, weather radios offer another level of capability by automatically broadcasting messages about local weather events directly from NOAA. With this feature, you can leave your radio plugged in around the clock to receive advanced warnings about extreme weather in your area. When that happens, you'll have a fully-charged battery and time to prepare.</p><p>This feature doesn't come with a noticeable increase in price and is very common in today's emergency radios. We strongly recommend prioritizing it if you frequently experience severe weather.</p>",407.0
15,gaiter mask,"<h2>Types of gaiter masks</h2><p>There are three main types of gaiter masks. Each type of mask offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your gaiter mask, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type of gaiter mask to best fit your needs. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of the different types of masks before making your final purchase.</p><h3>Running</h3><p>Running gaiter masks are typically the most lightweight and made from extremely breathable material. Even though they are the lightest option, make sure that the material will be protective enough. A quality running mask will typically be UV-resistant, made from a material with a UPF rating to protect you from the sun's harmful rays while outdoors. This type of gaiter mask is often made from a moisture-wicking technology, designed to keep you cool while running, hiking, climbing, backpacking, and more.</p><h3>Fishing</h3><p>Fishing gaiter masks are another popular type of gaiter mask. This type of mask is similar to a running mask, but the material usually features the highest UPF rating, to block out most of the sun's harmful rays while fishing throughout the day. Fishing gaiter masks come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and design patterns. They are typically waterproof, designed to keep you dry in the case of any splashes while fishing rivers, lakes, tributaries, and streams.</p><h3>Skiing</h3><p>Skiing gaiter masks are specifically designed for use in the coldest climates and hazardous weather conditions. This type of mask is typically the most expensive because it is built from the heaviest material, such as wool or thick cotton fabric. In addition to skiing, this type of gaiter mask makes a great option for snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, biking, ATV riding, and UTV riding. If you are participating in outdoor activities in warmer weather conditions, you may want to consider one of the other types of gaiter masks.</p>",321.0
16,hydration pack,"<h2>Types of hydration packs</h2><p>In order to get the most out of your gear, you need to choose the proper type. Yes, all hydration packs have a main bladder and connecting hose, but that doesn't mean they are all alike. Many work in conjunction with hiking backpacks and make it easier to use a water filter. The first step in finding the best hydration pack is knowing the different types.</p><h3>Hydration backpacks</h3><p>Easily the most common type of hydration pack, this type generally has a large bladder (at least two litres) and a convenient hose. However, unlike more streamlined types of hydration packs, these models are surrounded by a backpack. You can find them in conjunction with tactical backpacks, a good place to look if you need to store a lot of supplies.</p><p>In this category, you can find sleeker models with smaller bladders and more accessible straws. These are ideal for jogging and biking activities since your skin can breathe more easily and you can move around more comfortably. Conversely, larger bags with more substantial bladders are ideal for hiking since they carry more water. All of these should have multiple straps to adjust weight distribution, along with a durable hose and easy-flow valve for on-the-go drinking.</p><h3>Hydration waist packs</h3><p>A less common, but still noteworthy, type of hydration pack is the model which goes around your waist instead of over your shoulders with straps. There are two kinds of these waist packs. The first uses a standard water bottle that connects to a hip belt. It includes a spot to attach a hose so that you can drink on the move.</p><p>The other style of hydration waist pack uses a bladder. Similar to a bottle, the material is more forgiving and takes on the shape of its surroundings. These waist models tend to be less versatile, simply due to the limited capacity. You can't carry as much water, so they only really work for quick jogs or bike rides rather than as survival gear.<br/></p>",329.0
17,led flashlight,"<h2>Types of LED flashlights</h2><p>There are three main types of LED flashlights. Each type of flashlight offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your LED flashlight, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type of flashlight to best fit your needs. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of the different types of LED flashlights before making a decision on your final purchase.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>EDC LED flashlights, or everyday carry LED flashlights, are the most budget-friendly and portable type of LED flashlight. This type of LED flashlight is quite rugged, reliable, and it makes a perfect option for daily use around your home. These flashlights are ideal for tight spaces and working on any projects in your home. EDC flashlights also make a great emergency option, so it is a great idea to store one in your home or vehicle in case you need it.</p><h3>Rechargeable</h3><p>Rechargeable LED flashlights may be the most popular and most commonly found option on the market today. This type of LED flashlight typically includes a built-in lithium ion battery and a USB cable that can be charged via any outlet, vehicle cigarette lighter, or your personal laptop. Rechargeable LED flashlights are available in a variety of sizes, ranging from compact, portable options to large, lantern-style lights. Make sure to check the lifespan of your flashlight on a full battery charge before heading out on a long trip with no access to a charging port. It may be a good idea to carry a spare battery with you with this type of LED flashlight.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Tactical LED flashlights are best associated with law enforcement, military, or other special force groups. This type of LED flashlight is usually the most expensive due to the material that it is made from. Tactical LED flashlights are typically made from a high-quality, military-grade aluminum alloy or heavy-duty stainless steel. Many models are shock-resistant and completely waterproof, designed to withstand drops from a high distance and for use underwater. If you will be using your LED flashlight in inclement weather or in high-risk settings like construction zones, this type of flashlight makes a great option even though it is priced at a premium.</p>",376.0
18,rugged smartwatch,"<h2>Types of rugged smartwatches</h2><p>Smartwatches all seem kind of the same when you first start shopping for one. However, when it comes to rugged smartwatches, you'll want to pay close attention to even the little differences between various products. Some smartwatches work like the popular non-rugged kinds you know well — like the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch. Others are specifically built with functionality and features meant for rugged environments or uses.</p><p>There are two primary types of rugged smartwatches available: traditional smartphone smartwatches and fitness tracker smartwatches. Learn more about what each kind can offer below.</p><h3>Smartphone smartwatches</h3><p>Smartphone smartwatches are more commonly just called smartwatches. These watches are loaded with features. They connect to your smartphone, and they can actually replace your phone altogether when you want to leave your phone behind. You can use your smartphone to make or answer calls, send and receive text messages, open apps, and so much more. These styles of rugged smartwatches also include fitness tracking, keeping record of everything from your steps to your heart rate and more.</p><p>Smartphone smartwatches are the most well-rounded and versatile option. The only downside is that many traditional smartphone smartwatches aren't actually rugged. It's important to look at the materials and whether or not a watch is tested against drops, impacts, water, dust, and harsh wear to determine if it's really rugged.</p><h3>Fitness tracker smartwatches</h3><p>The alternative to a smartphone smartwatch is a fitness tracker watch. These smartwatches come in so many different styles, from simple fitness trackers that include watch functionality to wholly comprehensive fitness trackers with additional apps. However, most commonly, fitness tracker smartwatches are focused on capturing metrics like heart rate, steps, workouts or activity level, and GPS.</p><p>When you're looking for a rugged fitness tracker smartwatch, you can find some that are made for harsh environments or tough wear and tear. These often include additional features you need in tactical settings, like location data, GPS tracking, and altimeters for example. It's a good idea to look for fitness tracker smartwatches that can do more than just track your steps if you're hoping to get the most versatility and value.</p>",352.0
19,safety glasses,"<h2>Types of safety glasses</h2><h3>Prescription-friendly</h3><p>If you wear prescription glasses on any sort of a regular basis, you understand the pain and frustration of finding safety glasses that fit over your glasses while still providing proper protection from flying debris, dripping oil, and other hazards. Thankfully, there are a number of designs for safety glasses that were made with you in mind.</p><h3>Sunglasses</h3><p>Landscapers and countless other outdoor professionals need to protect themselves from both visible and invisible threats to their eyesight. Enter safety sunglasses. These safety glasses provide the same protection one would expect from traditional safety glasses with the added bonus of tinted lenses designed to protect against the assault of the sun. Whether you need simple UVA and UVB protection or anti-glare polarization on top of ultraviolet protection, there are plenty of options available on today's market.</p><h3>Ballistic</h3><p>Ballistic safety glasses (a.k.a. shooting glasses) take traditional safety glasses and add in a few features you would expect on the range. Sometimes, the only difference between basic and ballistic safety glasses is a Z87+ rating rather than the baseline Z87. Shooting glasses often come in a variety of lens colors to accommodate different lighting situations with some models offering interchangeable lenses to decrease the number of frames you need to store in your range bag. For those planning to head downrange, top-end offerings include ballistic-rated frames, replacing basic plastics with beefed-up polymers designed to withstand some serious flying debris.</p><h3>Anti-particle</h3><p>Small, airborne particles can be a significant concern for some individuals, but anti-particle safety glasses can save the day. An intermediate option between basic safety glasses and full-fledged safety goggles, anti-particle safety glasses use frame gaskets, usually made with closed-cell foam, to create a tight seal between the already minimal space between the frame and your face. Often, these gaskets will include ridges with very small gaps on the face-side of the gasket in order to minimize the inevitable fogging that comes with a complete seal.</p>",320.0
20,survival watch,"<h2>Types of survival watches</h2><p>Not all survival situations are the same, and it should come as no surprise that the gear they require is just as diverse. When you pick out a survival watch for your survival kit or part of your everyday carry, prioritize the features that matter most to you to get the most bang for your buck.</p><h3>Analog watches</h3><p>The analog watch face is timeless and never goes out of style. It can also be found on most of the survival watches on the market, thanks to its simplicity and enduring appeal. There are designs to satisfy anyone's personal style, and there's a nice variety on this list. Old-school analog watches are stone-simple and inexpensive, while premium options combine analog hands with digital screens to give you the best of both worlds.</p><p>Analog watches can keep up with digital watches in most aspects, but they do have some inherent limitations as a result of having physical hands. That's not a bad thing, it's just something to consider.</p><h3>Digital watches</h3><p>Digital watches offer certain features that purely analog watches just can't. Take advantage of things like 24-hour time, stopwatches, lap timers, multiple alarm clocks, and the ability to flip through information to get what you need, when you need it without cluttering up the small watch face with everything at once.</p><p>All this digital power needs a battery to run, so it's not a bad idea to keep a fresh battery around to give yourself a backup in case of an emergency. Personal preference plays a part in watch selection, too, and some people feel strongly about the choice between digital and analog. Both are viable options, so go with the one that feels right to you.</p><h3>Smart watches</h3><p>One of the strategies embraced by all survivalists is conserving weight and space. Since you'll likely need to carry everything and travel by foot in a survival situation, everything you bring needs to earn its keep. One way to pack a huge amount of power into a small item is with a smartwatch. By combining timekeeping with GPS navigation, health monitoring, and weather instruments, these advanced watches are one of the best assets you can have.</p><p>Keep in mind that this much computing power requires a lot of electricity compared to a traditional watch, so battery life is limited. Solar charging can extend lifespan, but you'll still want to keep an eye on that charge meter.</p>",397.0
21,tool box,"<h2>Types of tool boxes</h2><p>There's a tool for every job, and it's important to pick the right kind of tool box to keep your collection in. Whether you have a few essentials for small fixes around the house or a full suite of professional tools and one of those air compressor lines that unrolls from the ceiling (which some of us desperately want, by the way), you need an appropriate place to store them.</p><h3>Handheld</h3><p>Small, portable tool boxes have been around as long as there have been job sites. Handheld tool boxes are intended to carry the essentials; not every tool you might need or a bunch of hardware. Traditionally, these were made from stamped metal and used a drop-in tray to separate large and small items.</p><p>We found plenty of options that use composite materials that are tough enough to endure life on a construction site without weighing you down. Some also have clever features like clear panels so you can see through the lid before rummaging around for something you need. If you only have a few tools, this is the way to go. It's also what we'd recommend for transporting part of your collection to an off-site project.</p><h3>Workbench</h3><p>Do you have more tools than your handheld tool box can store? Congratulations, it's time for an upgrade to a workbench. This is a joyous time, so relish the opportunity to turn your garage or basement into a genuine workspace. You'll enjoy a more tidy place to work and have plenty of drawers for all your tools and accessories.</p><p>We recommend looking for a workbench with locking casters that are stable when stationary, but easy to roll when you need them to. A fully-loaded workbench is heavier than you want to move without wheels. We also appreciate a practical work surface. Yes, wood is easy to scratch and dent, but it's forgiving and — in the worst-case scenario — easier and less expensive to replace than steel. These tool boxes are expensive, but they last long enough that you'll want to get the best you can afford the first time around.</p><h3>Truck tool boxes</h3><p>Trucks are great for getting work done. They've got plenty of cargo room, four-wheel drive, and lots of ground clearance. Unfortunately, they're also great for getting your tools jacked the second you look away. Sooner or later, all truck owners realize that ""finders keepers"" is a very real thing.</p><p>Truck tool boxes mount to the bed from the inside, so only you can remove them. Locking lids let you secure your tools and keep them protected from the elements. Inside, there's a huge amount of space for large power tools, multiple handheld tool boxes, and even your lunch. They also leave several inches of space between the bottom of the box and the bed of your truck so you can still fit things like plywood underneath.</p>",473.0
22,two way radio,"<h2>Types of two-way radios</h2><p>Governed by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), airwaves are sorted depending on the purpose of the radio. You wouldn't want a stranger chirping in while you're relaying specific or sensitive information, and by sticking to the proper radio types, you can avoid this. The right radio ensures that whether you are communicating military jargon, chewing the fat, or dealing with sensitive information, you are entirely secure.</p><h3>FRS & GMRS</h3><p>Short for Family Radio Service and General Mobile Radio Service, these bandwidths are built for business, personal, and recreational use. An FRS radio has a wattage limit of two and the channels have a range of roughly a quarter-mile in normal situations. These radios give you access to 22 channels, with over half of them being low-power options that rely on a half-watt system. FRS radios are governed by Part 95 of FCC regulations.</p><p>At one point, GMRS radios were lumped together with FRS radios, but since 2017 this has changed. Nowadays, they are deemed separate. A GMRS radio requires a license, unlike its counterpart. It can access 30 channels overall, though only 22 of them can be reached with these models. They also stand out because the system uses power over two watts. Also governed by Part 95 of FCC rules, a household needs only one license.</p><h3>Amateur ham radios</h3><p>Usually referred to as standard Ham radios, these are regulated by part 97 of FCC regulations. Accessible to those of all ages, these radios require a license to legally operate them. Depending on the level of that license, you can access different frequencies. It is by far the most powerful type of two-way radio, though it is also bulky and more administratively tedious.</p><p>These radios usually consist of a large central structure that links to an external antenna. Though you can find some mobile options, they are still far less convenient than other options. However, the function is more advanced. You can access UHF, VHF, and HF frequencies, giving you the chance to fiddle with morse, pictures, and video communications.</p><h3>Citizen's band radios</h3><p>Designed for business and personal applications, these two-way radios often come at a higher price point than GMRS counterparts. There is no license needed to operate these devices, governed by part 95 of FCC regulations. The radios can also be used by those of any age and are common in the transportation industry.</p><p>These radios have access to 40 channels in AM settings and in Single SideBand mode. However, as a result of the fact that these channels are shared, it is not a desirable system for secure communications. In most cases, you will find these two-way radios in long-haul trucks because of the structure and range.</p>",444.0
23,waterproof bluetooth speaker,"<h2>Types of waterproof Bluetooth speakers</h2><p>Bluetooth speakers come in so many different forms. Now that this technology is so readily available, you can find an array of waterproof Bluetooth options in every size, style, and even color. But, when you're looking for just the right speaker, you'll want to make sure you think about which type is the best fit for your needs.</p><p>There are three common types of these speakers to choose from: portable, full-size (or stationary), and mounted. Learn more about what each has to offer right here.</p><h3>Portable Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Portable Bluetooth speakers are one of the most popular choices. These handy speakers are both waterproof and designed to be taken anywhere. Compact in size, portable speakers come in all different kinds of compact packages, from slim squares to small circles — and some even feature accessories like carabiners, lanyards, or suction cups so you can easily stick them onto your gear or anywhere else.</p><p>The biggest advantage of a portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker is its versatility. You can use these speakers at home, in your garage, or absolutely anywhere outdoors. It's the perfect choice for those who want to take their audio on the go without being weighed down by a bulky device.</p><h3>Full-size Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Full-size Bluetooth speakers, which can also be called stationary speakers, are the exact opposite of portable models. These speakers are larger and heavier, and they're meant to be placed in one spot. Though you can't take them along with you, they deliver more powerful — and often more high-quality — sound. They're also a really great option for large outdoor spaces, like your backyard.</p><p>If you're looking for waterproof Bluetooth speakers that you'll use in just one place, a full-size speaker is your best bet. Just keep in mind, though, that the speaker will take up space on the ground, on a table, or wherever you choose to put it.</p><h3>Mounted Bluetooth speakers</h3><p>Another variety of stationary speaker is a mounted Bluetooth speaker. These aren't super popular, but they are an option for those who want to create whole sound systems in outdoor areas — your patio, for example, or your outdoor workspace. These speakers tend to be quite compact in size, and they mount in place to items like walls, patio overhangs, and other indoor or outdoor structures.</p><p>As a more specialized kind of waterproof Bluetooth speakers, mounted models are a bit more limited. However, this style of speaker can create some really great sound quality, and it enables you to easily control your outdoor entertainment right from your smartphone or other Bluetooth-equipped devices.</p>",424.0
24,whetstones,"<h2>Types of whetstones</h2><p>Whetstones come in so many different varieties. Just a quick search for whetstones will turn up thousands of choices in all kinds of different materials, shapes, and sharpening grits. But there's an easy way to begin narrowing down your options to find a quality product: Decide which type of whetstone you want to work with.</p><p>There are three common, overarching types of sharpening stones. Whetstones are divided into types based on how you use them to sharpen a knife: with oil, with water, or with tough diamonds. You can learn more about each kind below.</p><h3>Oil whetstones</h3><p>Oil whetstones are one of the most common kinds you'll encounter. Considered the ""traditional"" choice, these stones are natural stones made from either novaculite, aluminum oxide, or silicone carbide. In order to file your knife and sharpen its blade, you'll use oil to lubricate the metal against these stone varieties. Oil whetstones can offer different densities and create different finishes on your knife blades. Most leave behind a polished edge.</p><p>The biggest drawback of an oil whetstone is this kind of sharpening stone tends to cut metal more slowly compared to man-made stones. This slower cutting rate means you'll have to take more time to work on your knife, which can be frustrating. Additionally, because oil is the necessary lubricant, the process can be messy and harder to clean up.</p><h3>Water whetstones</h3><p>Water whetstones are another option, though they're a bit newer and still gaining popularity. Like oil whetstones, water whetstones can be made from natural stone — but they can also be made from synthetic materials. Synthetic water whetstones are the most common. Typically made of some kind of aluminum oxide variety, these sanding stones are abrasive but soft in their density. This makes water whetstones faster at cutting; they're able to break down old metal easily to sharpen quickly.</p><p>While faster cutting is the biggest advantage of water whetstones, the lubrication is another benefit. Water is easy to wipe down and clean up once you're done sharpening. However, there is one disadvantage: Water whetstones wear down quickly, and they tend to break apart more easily. This leads to uneven surfaces on your sharpening stone, which can make sharpening knives more difficult.</p><h3>Diamond whetstones</h3><p>Diamond whetstones are the toughest variety you can buy. They're actually made with small diamonds, which are attached to a metal plate. Those diamonds and their high hardness level cut very quickly, taking blades from dull to sharp in no time at all. There are two kinds of diamond whetstones to choose from: mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline. Both last a long time, but mono-crystalline are the most durable.</p><p>Diamond whetstones sharpen at a fast speed and stay flat even over many uses. There's just one drawback: the cost. These sharpening stones are very expensive, and they're an investment. However, you'll get a whetstone that lasts for the long term, which can be a benefit.</p>",477.0
25,4 person tents,"<h2>Types of 4-person tents</h2><h3>Dome-shaped</h3><p>These types of tents are what most people think of when they think of tents: a shelter with an arch-like structure held up by criss-crossing poles. These options cave in on the sides, often making the tent feel less spacious, but they hold up against heavy winds far better than their cabin-like counterparts.</p><p>These tents vary heavily when it comes to features, though most of the dome-shaped tents listed above feature vestibules to keep gear dry. REI Co-op's classic Base Camp 4 is just one example of this structure. Others include the Kelty Wireless 4 Tent and the Marmot Limestone 4P Tent.</p><h3>Cabin tents</h3><p>Cabin tents — known for their nearly vertical walls — often offer more room for you and your gear than traditional dome-shaped tents. Some of these options take on an almost rectangular shape, and some still slant out on the sides, while still maintaining their upright shape. These tents also often feature vestibules for gear storage, or they have options to extend the rainfly as an awning using trekking poles. These tents can extend to be over six feet — perfect for your lengthy friends.</p><p>This category includes tents such as the REI Co-op Grand Hut 4, as well as the Eureka Copper Canyon LX 4 and the NEMO Wagontop 4 Tent.</p><h3>Ultralight</h3><p>While it's not very common to bring a four-person tent backpacking due to weight considerations, there are plenty of tents on the market that pack down small and can fit as many as four people. The leader in this category is the Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL4, which can pack down to weigh as little as five pounds on the trail.</p><p>These tents are built to withstand extreme conditions, while using as little material as possible. Ultralight options are often not as comfortable and spacious as other options, so if you are seeking a tent for more luxurious car camping, look towards the larger dome-like and cabin tents.</p>",322.0
26,6 person tents,"<h2>Types of 6-person tents</h2><h3>Dome-shaped tents</h3><p>One of the most widely available tent styles, dome-shaped tents are freestanding and take on an arch-like structure. While they may have a peak height of over six feet, they do cave in on all sides, making them feel a bit less spacious than tents with more vertical walls. This does mean, however, that they hold up better in the wind, as the slanted tent sides do a better job with deflection.</p><p>These tents are typically fairly simple to set up and can feature ample storage space, including vestibules. This includes our budget pick, the Coleman Sundome 6 and the REI Co-op Base Camp 6.</p><h3>Cabin tents</h3><p>Cabin tents are known for their nearly vertical walls and often offer more room for you and your gear than traditional dome-shaped tents. Some of these options take on an almost rectangular shape, and some still slant out on the sides, while still maintaining their upright shape. These tents also often feature vestibules for gear storage, or they have options to extend the rainfly as an awning using trekking poles.</p><p>The downside of these tents is they often don't stand up well against strong winds, since their sides are so vertical. This category includes tents such as the CORE 6 Person Instant Cabin Tent and the NEMO Wagontop 6. The REI Co-op Kingdom 6 tent is also similar, with a tunnel-like structure.</p><h3>Instant tents</h3><p>Pretty self-explanatory, these tents are known for their ability to be set up almost instantly. Oftentimes, the poles will be pre-attached to the tent fabric, removing at least one step of the process. These tents are also very easy to take down and are a great option for newer campers looking to not waste time dealing with a tent.</p><p>This category also includes the CORE 6 Person Instant Cabin Tent, our pick for the best instant tent.</p>",305.0
27,air mattresses for camping,"<h2>Types of air mattresses for camping</h2><h3>Closed-cell</h3><p>Lately, I've noticed more and more thru-hikers with accordion-style sleeping pads attached to the backs of their packs. After rolling into way too many campsites late in the afternoon after long days on the trail and having to spend what feels like an eternity blowing up my air mattress, I can see the appeal.</p><p>The name comes from the material used to manufacture the pad, rigid closed cell foam (CCF), which is a dense material with tiny trapped air pockets for insulation and cushioning. While closed-cell sleeping pads don't provide the same R-value or comfort most blow-up mattresses will, they are lightweight, easy to set up, puncture-resistant, and way less expensive than most other sleep system options. They can also be layered for additive R-value and cushioning if you have the room.</p><h3>Inflatable</h3><p>Inflatable camping mattresses look a lot like pool mattresses. Both are generally made from the same type of polyvinyl material and when blown up provide 2.5- to 3-inches of air between your backside and the ground. Many inflatable camping mattresses also contain reflective material inside for additional insulation and comfort. Depending on whether you are a back or side sleeper, the firmness mattress can be tailored to suit your sleep style by simply adding a few extra breaths during setup.</p><p>While they take more time to blow up and take down than close cell options, can make a lot of noise if you toss and turn at night, and are more to puncture, inflatable mattresses are generally lightweight, cost-effective, pack down to less than the size of a Nalgene bottle, and provide excellent camping comfort. Four-season inflatable mattresses even contain down insulation for extra insulation, and many air mattresses even have a pump, either separate or integrated into their stuff sacks, for faster set up.</p><h3>Self-inflating</h3><p>Self-inflating camping mattresses are constructed out of a combination of open-cell foam and polyvinyl, providing up to 4-inches of insulation and max cushioning and comfort. To set up a self-inflating mattress, all you have to do is unroll the pad, open the air valve, and wait 20 to 30 minutes for the air cells in the foam to expand. You can even add air by manually adding a few breaths to the pad for firmer support.</p><p>Thanks to their dual-material construction, self-inflating camping mattresses provide arguably the most warmth, comfort, and quiet, regardless of your sleep style or the season. The downside is that this style of mattress is heavier and doesn't pack down as small as a regular air mattress. However, if comfort is king for you and you can spare the room in your pack on your camping excursions, a self-inflating mattress is a luxurious and warm good way to go.</p>",450.0
28,american made pocket knives,"<h2>Types of American-made pocket knives</h2><p>There are three main types of pocket knives. Each type of pocket knife offers its own unique set of features and advantages. Depending on your individual preferences, where you will be using your pocket knife, and the type of activities you will be participating in, you may require a different type to best fit your needs. Make sure to familiarize yourself with all of the different types of pocket knives before making a decision on your final purchase.</p><h3>Camper</h3><p>The camper pocket knife is also known as the multitool pocket knife. This type of pocket knife is well equipped with a number of different tools, including screwdrivers, can/bottle openers, scissors, pliers, nail files, toothpicks, tweezers, and more. This is by far the most versatile type of pocket knife, especially if you plan on using your pocket knife for several different purposes. Camper pocket knives are available in a number of different shapes, sizes, styles, colors, and price points. If you do decide to purchase a camper knife, make sure that the blade is strong enough and durable enough to fit your individual preferences.</p><h3>Canoe</h3><p>The canoe pocket knife is named after its canoe shape when it is closed. This type of pocket knife includes two blades of different shapes or sizes. The blades collapse on opposite ends, but on the same side of the knife handle. It typically carries both a pen blade and a drop point blade. The pen blade features a thin narrow blade, while the drop point blade has a straight spine until the very tip of the blade. Canoe pocket knives are generally safe to use, and they can safely fit in your pocket for everyday use or for use while on outdoor trips.</p><h3>Pen</h3><p>Pen pocket knives are one of the oldest types of knives. This type of pocket knife was named after the type of pen that needs to be dipped into a container of ink, typically a quill pen. The pen knife includes a thin, narrow blade with a sleek tip that closely resembled the famous ink and quill combination pen. This type of pocket knife is extremely comfortable, but it can be slightly larger than some of the other types of pocket knives. It is available to purchase in a variety of different price options, depending on the construction quality and design.</p>",388.0
29,ankle holsters,"<h2>Types of ankle holsters</h2><h3>Strap-on</h3><p>Ankle holsters must be secure and easy to use, and for most people, putting their holster on in the morning must fall into the category of ""easy to use."" Many (if not most) ankle holsters rely on a single strap or a series of straps to secure them in place, making them much easier to don and doff without removing your shoes than other ankle holsters. Most often, these holsters employ hook-and-loop straps to further improve the user's experience.</p><p>In addition to their ease of use, strap-on holsters usually provide a better fit than most other ankle holsters. The holster straps allow users to provide the perfect level of tension, allowing him or her to find an ideal balance between concealability and comfort.</p><h3>Slip-on</h3><p>Slip-on ankle holsters are easier and more economical to manufacture, making them a favorite choice for buyers looking to stick to a budget. These holsters usually consist of a neoprene band to which the actual holster is attached, providing a good combination of flexibility and compression. However, without a calf strap to secure the holster, most slip-on holsters will only work for short-term excursions.</p><p>Since most slip-on ankle holsters are made of neoprene, comfort can be an issue, especially when wearing the holster for an extended period of time. As such, the best slip-on holsters combat this issue with moisture-wicking liners or breathable neoprene bands.</p>",228.0
30,ar 15 scopes,"<h2>Types of AR-15 scopes</h2><p>AR optics fall into four major categories: red dot, holographic, fixed-power, and variable power. Each one offers significant advantages and disadvantages that are endemic to the platform and should be considered when buying a new optic. Here's a breakdown of these optic types, how they work, and a summary of their advantages and disadvantages.</p><h3>Red dot</h3><p>Red dot optics are the simplest optics on this list. They produce the reticle by projecting a simple colored LED light onto a pane of glass. The light can be filtered through a shaped aperture, which can allow for red dots with things like crosshairs, ACSS reticles, and chevron reticles.</p><p>In general, the advantages of red dots are that they are extremely durable, can be made incredibly small, and have incredibly long battery lives, sometimes stretching well into tens of thousands of hours.</p><p>Disadvantages of red dots are that the light can appear streaked or starburst for those with astigmatism, total loss of capability if the battery does go out, and reticle scaling under magnification, meaning that if you magnify a red dot, the dot gets bigger, which can take up more of your field of view.</p><h3>Holographic</h3><p>Holographic sights work by projecting an image with lasers between two mirrors and two panes of glass, causing a reticle that ""floats"" in front of your weapon when viewed through the hologram window.</p><p>Holographic sights have the advantage of being mostly unaffected by astigmatism in the shooter's eye. They also have very crisp reticles that are unaffected by magnification, meaning it magnifies the image but not the reticle, so you can be more precise with your aim.</p><p>The disadvantage of holographic optics is that they project a holographic image with laser energy, and so they consume significantly more battery power than red dots, oftentimes with one-fiftieth battery life. Another disadvantage is that they're usually significantly larger, due to the more complex emitter.</p><h3>Fixed-power</h3><p>Fixed-power optics do not change magnification levels, and while technically you could argue that red dots and holographic sights are fixed power, I'm using fixed-power to mean lensatic optics with an etched reticle, which includes unmagnified optics like prismatic optics that can take the place of a red dot.</p><p>Fixed-power optics have several advantages, namely that due to their etched reticle, they do not require battery power to work, and their reticle image will be overall more precise. Additionally, they will often have an improved field-of-view and clarity over variable-power optics, with their lens geometry being precisely engineered for a single magnification level. They may feature illuminated reticles as an option, and many high-magnification precision optics are fixed-power.</p><p>Their primary disadvantage is their lack of flexibility at different ranges, meaning that optics with a high enough magnification level are effectively unusable at closer ranges, and vice versa.</p><h3>Variable-power</h3><p>Variable power optics are similar in construction to their fixed-power brethren in that they use lenses that feature etched reticles. The key difference is that they can toggle through magnification settings to address different ranges. They come in two major varieties: first focal plane, and second focal plane.</p><p>The first focal plane offers a scaling reticle that increases in size as you zoom in. It's useful for shooters who want reticles that reveal finer detail when zoomed in, which can be useful when shifting from low magnification where a coarse optic is needed, to high magnification when things like wind call grids and bullet drop compensators become more relevant.</p><p>The second focal plane has a reticle that does not change size even as magnification is changed. It's useful for shooters who want to maintain visual similarity of the reticle across all magnification levels, and who understand that they will have to do mental math to convert measurements depending on the magnification level.</p><p>One advantage of variable power optics is that they allow you to have a single optic that can be used at multiple distances without needing offset red dots, re-zeroing, or backup iron sights. Another advantage is that they can allow you more magnification than you typically need at a certain distance. This allows for improved visibility to ensure, for instance, you're indeed about to shoot a coyote hiding in the brush and not a young fawn.</p><p>The disadvantage of variable power optics is that they're oftentimes more expensive, heavier, and larger than equivalent fixed-power optics. Also, lower-end options can experience visual distortion at different magnification levels.</p>",718.0
31,backpacking sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of backpacking sleeping bags</h2><p>Shopping for a good backpacking sleeping bag can be a bewildering experience. It helps to first identify what you will use the bag for prior to starting your search. The more dialed in your anticipated needs, the easier it is to filter out the bags that won't satisfy</p><p>Backpacking sleeping bags are different from regular camping sleeping bags in three important ways: they're lighter, they pack smaller, and they have a higher warmth-to-weight ratio. When considering your purchase, select the bag with the best warmth-to-weight ratio that will meet the needs of most of your trips and carry the lightest and most compressible you can afford. Every ounce in your pack counts when traveling dozens of miles day after day. Also, remember that your sleeping bag depends on what's underneath it for optimal efficiency, so check out the R-value of your sleeping pad. Try to get a lightweight one that has an R-value greater than four. Backpacking sleeping bags come generally with two choices of insulation: synthetic or down.</p><h3>Synthetic</h3><p>The advantages of synthetic insulation are twofold. Most importantly, synthetic insulation performs better when wet because it does a much better job retaining its loft and it also tends to dry out faster than down. They also generally cost less. The disadvantages are that synthetic bags don't compress as small as their down counterparts, and they weigh more for the same insulative performance. Synthetic is better in damp conditions and is non-allergenic.</p><h3>Down</h3><p>Down remains nature's best insulator, as it has a very high warmth-to-weight ratio and incredible compressibility. Down bags weigh less and compress smaller than synthetic filled bags, and they also cost more — sometimes much more. Down fibers also tend to last longer than synthetics which compress over time and lose R-value. On the downside, down is also a cold mess when wet because when wet, the feathers clump and lose their ability to trap dead air to insulate, leaving you a frigid, shivering mess. The good news is that it's not that hard to keep a down bag dry these days with DWR-treated shells and water-resistant down. Down is best in cold, dry conditions.</p><h3>Shape</h3><p>Backpacking sleeping bags are almost exclusively mummy-shaped bags which increase warmth and minimize weight through a more form-fitting design. Semi-rectangular or rectangular-shaped bags are generally for camping since they are heavier and tend to be colder due to the increased interior volume (your body has to heat up all that air).</p><h3>Season</h3><p>Although there isn't an industry-wide hard and fast rule, I consider any bag that's rated 20F or above to be a three-season bag (spring, summer, and fall use), and any bag that's rated below 20F to be a four-season bag.</p>",446.0
32,backpacking sleeping pads,"<h2>Types of backpacking sleeping pads</h2><p>More often than not, sleeping pads are designed for specific purposes like weather conditions and environments. For instance, one pad might be great to use in the summer, but terrible in winter. They also have advantages and disadvantages for sleeping positions.</p><h3>Closed-cell foam</h3><p>Closed-cell foam is a dense sheet of foam where each bubble is separated by thin-pliable walls. An easier way to visualize it is to say it's like the ISO-mat you're issued in boot camp (or a yoga mat).</p><p>Closed-cell foam sleeping pads are lightweight, durable, and offer consistent insulation in all weather conditions, but they're also not as comfortable or supportive as other options. Nonetheless, many outdoorsmen use them in addition to a primary sleeping pad.</p><h3>Open-cell foam</h3><p>Open-cell foam is when more than half of the cells are open, which makes it softer and more breathable than closed-cell foam. It feels almost like packing insulation. As a sleeping pad, they're also referred to as self-inflating sleeping pads.</p><p>Where the name ""self-inflating"" comes from is when you roll them up, it pushes the air out, so when you unroll them and open a valve, they expand on their own. But to maximize comfort and capabilities, you still need to blow in a few breaths. While they're bulkier than other options, they are very comfortable, warm, and durable. They're a solid utilitarian choice.</p><h3>Air pad</h3><p>An air pad is like an air mattress in that it's inflatable and the primary insulation is air, but they're usually tailored for individual use and specific temperature conditions. You can find air pad designs for warm, cool, cold, and extremely cold conditions.</p><p>Air pads are widely considered to be the most comfortable and the most packable of the three pads, but they're also the most fragile. They can be punctured and hold water, which will eventually result in bacteria or mold growth.</p>",305.0
33,ballistic glasses,"<h2>Types of ballistic glasses</h2><p>""Ballistic glasses,"" ""eye protection,"" and ""safety glasses"" get tossed around interchangeably and there are some important reasons not to mix them up. A woodshop and an open-faced motorcycle helmet do not present the same hazards. What you deal with on a shooting range and what you face in combat are two very different things. There's great eye pro for all those scenarios, but it isn't one-size-fits-all kind of gear.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for shooting</h3><p>If you found your way here, you probably need ballistic glasses that are tough enough for the international two-way shooting gallery. Eye protection for shooters can be divided into two categories: those built to civilian standards and those built to military standards.</p><p>The civilian ANSO Z87.1-2020 standard requires ballistic glasses to protect your eyes from projectiles in a wide variety of settings. This includes hunting and recreational shooting, but the threats you'll encounter in those activities are nothing compared to the dangers of a hot battlefield. The military's MIL-PRF-31013 standard subjects ballistic glasses to much harsher testing, and that's the standard we used for this gear guide.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for work</h3><p>If you need eye protection for work on a construction site, machine shop, lumber yard, or other dynamic environments, the ANSI standard is more than sufficient. You can open up your options and save a bundle by shopping in this category of eye protection, too.</p><p>These glasses can also serve you perfectly well in recreational shooting sports. You don't need the very toughest eye protection to poke holes in paper or knock down game animals, so you should be in good hands with a pair of ANSI-approved shooting glasses. Just don't bring them to one of Uncle Sam's shooting ranges.</p><h3>Ballistic glasses for motorcycling</h3><p>We'd love to believe that every service member is a stone-cold gunslinger, but the reality is that most people shoot once a year to qualify––if they even do that. It's entirely possible that there are more motorcyclists than serious shooters in the U.S. Military.</p><p>The military requires service members to wear a DOT-approved helmet, but you don't have to wear a full-face helmet. Open-face alternatives are popular, but they aren't the safest type of motorcycle helmet. Aside from leaving your money-maker exposed to asphalt and truck bumpers, they do nothing to protect your eyes. You can upgrade your riding safety with a solid pair of ballistic glasses. Your options range from impact-resistant sunglasses to padded goggles. All of them are better than your reflexes.</p>",406.0
34,bushcraft axes,"<h2>Types of bushcraft axes</h2><p>Bushcraft axes, like plenty of other axes, come in all different shapes, sizes, lengths, and weights. They can feature various kinds of cutting edges and head shapes, and each specific type of bushcraft axe can be used for specific needs or uses. Meant for wilderness skills and uses, most bushcraft axes are hardy and durable.</p><p>Typically, any bushcraft axe is meant to help you handle a variety of outdoor tasks. Part survival tool and part wood splitting and chopping tool, a bushcraft axe can cover skills like felling trees, chopping logs, cutting apart game, and even hammering tent stakes into hard ground. Survival tasks like chopping through ice and creating kindling are also possible with one of these axes.</p><p>To find just the right bushcraft axe for your needs, you can learn more about the different types of axes and their uses right here.</p><h3>Bushcraft Hatchet</h3><p>A bushcraft hatchet is a smaller, more compact axe that's designed to be held and used with just one hand. It's a perfectly portable option, with a handle that typically measures between 9 and 14 inches in length and an axe head that weighs between 1 and 1.5 pounds. With a bushcraft hatchet, you can tackle tasks like splitting small logs for firewood, carving various types of wood, and cutting limbs or clearing a path.</p><p>You shouldn't rely on a bushcraft hatchet for any chopping or cutting jobs that require you to slice through wood that's 2 inches or more in thickness. It's a better choice for smaller, one-handed jobs that don't require a ton of force or effort.</p><h3>Small bushcraft axe</h3><p>A small bushcraft axe is a step up from a hatchet. This kind of axe can be used one-handed or with both hands, and it's both longer and heavier. Small axes tend to have handles between 18 and 20 inches in length and a head that weighs between 1.5 and 2 pounds. It's able to handle larger pieces of wood and tougher jobs; you can use one of these bushcraft axes for carving, chopping, and splitting.</p><p>A small bushcraft axe is one of the most versatile options available, as it's still easy enough to carry anywhere and highly versatile. You can cut items up to 4 inches thick with one of these one- or two-handed cutting tools. It's even possible to take down medium-sized trees.</p><h3>Bushcraft felling axe</h3><p>A bushcraft felling axe is the right choice if you want an axe that can handle some seriously big tasks. It's the biggest kind you'll find for bushcraft use — these axes are significantly longer and heavier, and they're designed to take down big or even massive trees. Made just for felling, these axes tend to have handles between 24 and 30 inches long with a head that weighs between 2 and 4 pounds in total.</p><p>A felling axe isn't the most travel-ready option, but it's the best choice if you need to take down trees. These are great for anyone who's working on their own outdoor property or headed into thickly wooded areas.</p>",502.0
35,butterfly knives,"<h2>Types of butterfly knives</h2><p>As you scour the catalogs of knife vendors searching for your ideal butterfly knife, you may begin to realize that they're not necessarily segregated into any specific category. A lot of them seem to do almost the exact same thing with much of the differences being more subjective rather than objective. In short, you probably won't see butterfly knives in the loadouts of soldiers or wildlife rangers. Even so, there are some knives, however, that are able to take care of certain jobs just a little bit better than others. Here are a few disciplines through which a balisong can distinguish itself.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>Balisongs favoring EDC duty may stand out with big, utilitarian blades or an overall compact design that's friendly on the pocket. Nearly all of them would have built-in pocket clips for ease of transport. Those with spring-loaded latches are easier to deploy and safer to secure on a regular basis until needed. Such knives will often feature the most robust, corrosion-resistant, and dependable build quality to ensure a long life.</p><h3>Self-defense</h3><p>These won't always be the most featureful knives that can rip through the wind like Sonic the Hedgehog, but they'll certainly be sharp enough to tear like Wolverine. Knives that best suit this category will often be the sharpest of flippers, typically larger spear points or bayonet-types, constructed with durable blade materials that can take a beating. Nicer examples may also feature spring-loaded latches for easier, quicker deployment in tense situations as well as pocket clips to aid in EDC duty.</p><h3>Trainers</h3><p>As per the name, trainers are literally intended to train enthusiasts how to properly deploy and flip their butterfly knives with minimal risk of injury. They'll be constructed under the same standards and build quality as the real thing and often using the same materials. Some high-end trainers may even use ball bearing pivots just like more premium butterfly knives. All trainers will feature the same common trait: a dull, rounded-off edge all the way around the blade eliminating the risk of cutting one's self.</p><h3>Novelty</h3><p>Remember the bottle opener and the pen? Yeah, that's as novelty as novelty gets. But there are plenty of novelty butterfly knives out there as the blade has become equally romanticized and demonized in modern times. Since they don't technically function as a real knife, some may consider trainers to be novelties for playing around with. Cheap, decorative knives with a priority on form over function may also fall under this category, knives constructed of cheap steel and wrapped in fancy pearlescent colors and such. You wouldn't use them to carve wood. You probably wouldn't think to use one for opening mail. But they definitely look pretty up on a shelf.</p>",448.0
36,cabin tents,"<h2>Types of cabin tents</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>This is like your dome tent's dad, in that it's made in a similar fashion, just with longer, stronger rods and (usually) heavier fabrics. Compared to normal camping tents, cabin tents are much more upright and provide more space. While all the cabin tents on our list are roomy and well-built, their sizes and features are what make them unique. You can find normal tents for a single person, but the smallest cabin tents are meant for groups of four. You can always take advantage of that size to give one or two people more room, but don't expect your cabin tent to be quite as portable or compact as a traditional alternative. Cabin tents also differ from one another in their intended length of stay. Most are designed for short-term use. Others are much more robust and can be used year-round; just remember that setting them up is quite a task.</p><h3>Hammock</h3><p>This is arguably not a cabin tent, but can be as roomy so we're including it here. These tents use an old fashioned method of hanging from a line suspended between either poles or trees, with the walls pulled away, creating a long peak down the middle. These are light, and can be more easily used in more remote areas, but aren't as secure as a traditional cabin tent.</p><h3>Yurt</h3><p>This style is picking up some popularity of late. Yurt tents are modelled after the portable, circular yurt dwellings of ancient Mongolia. They're spacious, and easily set up and broken down. Typically a central pole lifts the center high, and the circular wall drapes down all around. These typically also use treated cotton type cloth (vs the synthetic fabrics most other kinds of cabin tents use).</p>",288.0
37,camelbak,"<h2>Types of CamelBak products</h2><h3>Sport-specific</h3><p>The CamelBak brand got its start when EMT Michael Eidson jerry-rigged an IV bag, hose, and crew sock to keep himself hydrated during a grueling summer Texas bike race. To this day, CamelBak makes biking-specific hydration packs, but it has expanded its line to provide other sport-specific packs. The company now specializes in solutions for biking, hiking, and snow sports. While bikers and runners may need a minimalist CamelBak to achieve top times, skiers and snowboarders will opt for a pack with proper insulation for both the reservoir and hose. Find your niche, pick a pack, and get moving.</p><h3>General purpose</h3><p>Some people need a hydration pack that can handle more than just one sport at a time. There's a solution for you too. In addition to its sport-specific offerings, CamelBak has created a handful of general purpose and multi-sport options designed to keep you hydrated, geared up, and on the go.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Yeah, yeah, everyone's got something tacticool these days, but CamelBak's tactical hydration systems may just be worthy of the ""tactical"" name. While the Army may not endorse CamelBak systems, their stamp of ""OK"" does show that the big brass may have finally figured out what we already knew. While anyone can slap MOLLE onto a bag and call it a day, CamelBak makes sure that their bags provide the features and quality America's grunts have come to expect from quality field gear. So, next time the lieutenant gets lost, you'll be ready for it.</p>",246.0
38,camping gear,"<h2>Types of camping gear</h2><p>When considering camping gear, it's important to first understand what type of camping you will be doing. For car camping, where you just pull into a campground and set up, you can get away with cheaper, heavier gear. If you're going to be traveling by foot into the backcountry and carrying everything you need on your back, you'll want to find the lightest gear that can meet your needs — and this typically comes at greater cost due to the advanced lightweight materials and research and development costs.</p><h3>Tent</h3><p>If you are spending the night outside, most people want to be sheltered from the wind and rain, and this means setting up a tent. Car camping tents are generally larger, heavier, and bulkier and fit more people. Backpacking tents generally fit one to two people and weigh less than eight pounds.</p><h3>Sleeping bags</h3><p>A good sleeping bag is key to staying warm and comfortable during a night outside. Sleeping bags typically come in two designs: rectangular (for car camping) and mummy bags (for backpacking). The former are roomier and heavier and the latter maximize warmth per ounce in design by minimizing material.</p><h3>Sleeping pads</h3><p>If you're going to sleep on the ground, a good sleeping pad will keep you warmer and more comfortable. Sleeping bags work by trapping warm air in loft insulation, and when you lay on them, they lose almost all insulating ability below your body. This is why it's important to have a good sleeping pad to provide insulation and warmth. Sleeping pads come in two main types: closed-cell foam and air.</p>",262.0
39,camping grills,"<h2>Types of camping grills</h2><p>If you thought buying a grill was as simple as going to the hardware store and picking the right size, you've got another thing coming. Besides picking a side in the great Gas vs. Charcoal War, you'll need to consider how you're going to transport your grill and how much cleanup you're willing to do.</p><h3>Gas grills</h3><p>Gas grills are all about efficiency. Setting them up is as simple as screwing a bottle onto a hose. They heat up almost instantly, burn at a consistent temperature that's effortless to control, and don't make a mess. Propane bottles are also light, compact, and last quite a while, so they're easy to pack. That's why the vast majority of ultralight camp stoves use propane canisters. Propane also powers infrared grills via a heating element that separates the fuel from your food.</p><p>A dividing line appears when flavor comes into the equation. Propane is (arguably) flavorless, which some people prefer. Others want to have the crispy goodness that can only come from charcoal or wood. Those people aren't wrong, but you can't deny the convenience of gas grills.</p><h3>Charcoal and wood grills</h3><p>Wood-burning grills are as old-school as it gets. Charcoal is just a more efficient evolution of the same approach. Both are popular because of the flavor they impart in everything they cook. It's hard to describe and impossible to replicate. For many, it's simply the only option and it's the reason people are willing to shell out hundreds (or thousands) of dollars to put a smoker on their back porch.</p><p>The drawback of wood and charcoal is their relative lack of practicality. Instead of a little propane bottle, you'll need to lug around wood, kindling, and tinder, or a big bag of dirty briquettes. If looking like Loretta Lynn's dad doesn't bother you, the flavor could be worth it.</p><h3>Electric grills</h3><p>The cleanest fuel source is electricity because it doesn't require any combustion at all. Electric grills are popular for indoor use because they plug right into the wall and are safe to use in confined spaces. They also tend to be easy to clean, with non-stick cooking surfaces that can be wiped off once they're cool.</p><p>The lack of a traditional grill grate makes electric grills good for runny foods like bacon, eggs, and pancakes, but some people feel like some of the magic of grilling is lost as a result. There's no smoke and a less-satisfying aroma when you use electricity, and the reliance on an electric outlet can be limiting.</p>",416.0
40,camping hammocks,"<h2>Types of camping hammocks</h2><h3>Lounging hammocks</h3><p>These are your basic parachute hammocks — typically the most affordable options on the market. This includes options like the famed ENO SingleNest and DoubleNest hammocks, as well as budget options like the Wise Owl Outfitters DoubleOwl hammock.</p><p>These options are great for setting up in your backyard or the local park, and they're light enough to throw in your pack for backpacking. Although they often don't come with many features, you can purchase an additional bug net, rain tarp, and under- and over-quilts to use these hammocks all four seasons.</p><h3>Ultralight hammocks</h3><p>These hammocks are the best options for avid backpackers looking to cut out that heavy tent with an ultralight option. Hammocks like the Kammok Roo Single Ultralight Hammock weigh less than an apple and cut out heavy items like carbineers. These may not be the warmest options, so if you are going out in cold weather, make sure to invest in quilts or rain tarps to shield yourself from wind and weather. These hammocks are generally cheap compared to options with more features.</p><h3>Tent hammocks</h3><p>If you are camping in hammocks for all four seasons, tent-like hammocks will be your best bet, providing shelter from the elements. Options like the Hennessy Hammock Expedition Asym Zip and the Kammok Mantis All-In-One Hammock Tent come with built-in rain tarps and bug nets, as well as suspension systems.</p><p>Other options like the Lawson Blue Ridge Camping Hammock leave behind the banana-like hammock shape altogether and suspend a flat frame, which doubles as a tent bivy that can be staked to the ground. These options are typically more expensive and not great for lounging and sitting up, so make sure you definitely require these additional features.</p>",283.0
41,camping lanterns,"<h2>Types of camping lanterns</h2><p>Camping can take a lot of different forms, so it stands to reason that camping lanterns are just as varied. There are advantages and disadvantages to each. We're here to make sense of the different power sources, features, and benefits you should consider to narrow down your search for the right one.</p><h3>Battery</h3><p>Most of the camping lanterns out there use electricity to generate light. Electricity is cheap (if not free), efficient, and doesn't produce toxic emissions like traditional fuels. Camping lanterns that use disposable batteries are usually the cheapest, but rechargeable batteries are also available and pay for themselves in the long run.</p><p>Rechargeable batteries are tough to beat because they can be charged from a wall or car outlet, power bank, or solar charger. Many can also be used to charge other devices like your phone, GPS, or two-way radio. In most cases, a camping lantern with a rechargeable battery would be our go-to option. That being said, there are times when something else is a better tool for the job.</p><h3>Solar panels and hand cranks</h3><p>Even if you know you want an electric camping lantern, there may be times when you don't have access to a power source or spare batteries. Extended camping trips, long hikes, and emergency situations can stretch disposable and rechargeable batteries to the point of failure. When that happens, you'll have to generate your own power.</p><p>Two power sources you can count on are the sun and your own body. Camping lanterns that are powered by a built-in solar panel or a hand-crank are a fantastic backup for emergency survival situations. They may take more time and effort to keep charged, but they might be the only light source you can count on.</p><h3>Gas</h3><p>Gas camping lanterns have been popular for ages. We've used them to light our campsites and relied on them during long power outages at home. Gas-powered lanterns can last a very long time and generate tons of light. They're also great for emergency preparedness because the fuel remains stable for a long time and isn't reliant on the grid to stay operational.</p><p>The downside to fuel-burning lanterns is increased risk. While they're generally safe, you will need to use caution to prevent nearby objects from overheating and catching fire. Burning petroleum-based fuel also generates carbon monoxide that can be deadly if allowed to get too concentrated. Proper ventilation is critical to the safe operation of any gas lantern.</p>",403.0
42,camping stoves,"<h2>Types of camping stoves</h2><p>Camping stoves come in two basic categories: ones you are willing to carry on your back for long distances and those you aren't — backpacking stoves and car camping/basecamp stoves.</p><h3>Backpacking</h3><p>Backpacking stoves are typically lightweight single-burner units that may or may not have the ability to simmer. They are almost exclusively fueled by isobutane/propane canisters or pressurized liquid fuel like white gas. The former is more convenient to use and more efficient, and the latter performs better at altitude and in cold temperatures. These stoves are typically designed to boil water fast for rehydrating dehydrated food or cooking simple foods like pasta or couscous. Most are not suitable for large, heavy pots or large groups.</p><h3>Car camping stoves</h3><p>Car camping stoves resemble home kitchen stoves and are much larger, heavier, and more powerful than backpacking stoves. They are portable stove tops and come in one- or two-burner configurations with pop-up windscreens to make them more efficient. Car camping stoves are much more versatile and perform better in terms of temperature control when cooking. They're also great for cooking for large groups.</p><h3>Biofuel stoves</h3><p>Biofuel stoves are generally stainless steel containers that serve as small fire pits and gain thermal efficiency through rocket stove design. The upside is that they don't use fossil fuels. The downside is that you have to find or bring along the fuel, light a fire, do your thing, wait for it to cool down, and then pack it up if you are moving again. Also, some wilderness areas prohibit fires from time to time.</p>",256.0
43,climbing packs,"<h2>Types of climbing packs</h2><p>Climbing backpacks are specialized gear designed to haul loads somewhat comfortably over horizontal terrain and be compact and streamlined enough to provide stability and freedom of movement over vertical terrain.</p><h3>Rock climbing</h3><p>Most rock climbing backpacks are designed for one-day multi-pitch climbing and have volume capacities ranging from 14 to 20 liters. They are intended to carry essential equipment like an extra rope, rack of climbing protection, harness, approach shoes, a headlamp, water, food, rain and warming layers, and a communication device. Generally, they are carried by the person belaying the leader to allow the leader to focus on leading the pitch.</p><p>It's important to get a rock climbing bag that's large enough to stow all of your gear inside of it. Crap dangling off the side tends to come unattached and go dangerously hurtling down the rock face. Climbing packs ride higher off the hips to avoid getting in the way of your climbing harness and most have removable hip belts and emergency whistles built into the sternum straps. Look for packs that are made from more durable materials, as they will be frequently abrading against rock and bombroof haul loops. Crag bags and small haul bags also fit into this category.</p><h3>Alpine mountaineering packs</h3><p>Alpine packs are designed to support adventures over mixed terrain like rock, ice, and snow. They all sport top-loading designs and lean towards much lighter high-tensile fabrics than rock climbing packs to save on overall weight. Alpine packs are also designed to externally carry ice axes via loop or toggle retention systems, crampons in special external pockets or with straps, and most have the ability to carry skis or snowboards. Most will have design considerations for quick access to avalanche safety kits consisting of a shovel, avalanche probe, and snow saw. They'll also have design features for externally carrying ice pickets and ropes. For one to three day mountaineering adventures, look for packs in the 35- to 50-liter range.</p><h3>Mountaineering expedition packs</h3><p>These packs generally sport all the features of alpine mountaineering packs but have much greater internal capacity (ranging from 55 to 110 liters) to accommodate for additional high altitude and cold-weather equipment. Due to the heavier loads, they are designed with more robust and more comfortable suspension systems designed to transfer the weight of the pack to your hips. The back panels are generally designed to provide more ventilation than alpine packs. They'll also have more external attachment points, internal access points, and internal organization pockets.</p>",410.0
44,compact binoculars,"<h2>Types of compact binoculars</h2><p>Binoculars are built for a range of uses, and the same goes for compact binoculars. Before you pull the trigger on your next pair, make sure the positive reviews you see online are applicable to how you plan on using a set of binoculars. Allow us to hit the high points so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Sporting</h3><p>Lots of people like to bring binoculars to sporting events and concerts. It can be nice to have a magnified view of the action, especially when you're in a large stadium that makes a massive screen look like a thumbnail. They're also popular for checking in on a birdfeeder from a nearby window. These compact binoculars prioritize lightness and affordability.</p><p>Because sporting binoculars are used in very controlled environments, they don't need to be particularly durable. Manufacturers reduce costs by eliminating protection against water, dust, and extreme temperatures. We wouldn't recommend these binoculars unless you have no plans to use them in austere environments.</p><h3>Birdwatching</h3><p>Birdwatching is serious business. Differentiating between similar species from a distance requires realistic colors and crisp lines. In fact, some of the best resources for researching binoculars can be found on sites dedicated to birdwatching.</p><p>The binoculars built for birders are generally high-quality items that provide excellent views and can be adjusted to a wide range of eyes, with or without glasses. They're relatively durable and feel right at home in the forest or sightseeing in a new city. They also make a great entry point for people looking for their first pair of quality binoculars because of their balance between price and features.</p><h3>Hunting</h3><p>Binoculars intended for hunting are held to a higher standard than most. That's because hunters encounter severe weather, harsh terrain, and limits on the amount of gear they can carry. A clear view can also spot the difference between a trophy animal and an immature buck that needs a year or two to grow.</p><p>Hunting binoculars are also great for tactical use. Lenses are built from high-quality glass and receive several coatings to protect against fog, glare, and scratches. The air inside hunting binoculars is typically purged with nitrogen to prevent internal fogging. Rubber seals keep out water and dust that can ruin a pair of binoculars. Durable rubber exteriors provide improved grip and protect against impacts.</p>",380.0
45,compasses,"<h2>Types of compasses</h2><h3>Baseplate compass</h3><p>The baseplate compass is the most common type of compass today. It allows for easy reading of the map because the baseplate is usually made of clear plastic with orienting arrows and lines throughout to make it easier to align the compass with your map and plot points. The baseplate usually includes an integrated magnifier to help read small print and terrain features on a map.</p><h3>Lensatic compass</h3><p>The lensatic compass is a type of sighting compass. The lensatic compass has a small magnifying lens on the near side — in fact, the term lensatic comes from the presence of this lens. The lensatic compass is commonly used similarly to a baseplate compass –— level hold and eyeball the degrees — but they are designed to be used for more precision sighting. The cover of a lensatic compass has a long, vertical notch that lines up with the bezel and the magnifying lens to allow the user to get a very specific and precise directional alignment.</p><h3>Mirror compass</h3><p>A mirror compass has a lid that goes over the face of the compass. The underside of the lid has a mirror with a long, vertical notch. This allows the user to view their landmark through the notch while using the mirror to accurately view the magnetic needle and bezel. The result can be a more accurate azimuth towards your destination.</p><h3>Global compass</h3><p>A global compass is a compass that can be used in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This is particularly useful to those who travel extensively, like the ski bums I met in Bariloche, Argentina, who fled the northern hemisphere in the summer to ski in the Andes Mountains when the seasons reverse.</p><h3>Thumb compass</h3><p>Thumb compasses are small compasses designed to be attached to the thumb for more rapid bearings while on the move. They are not commonly used as a primary navigation device, but as a readily accessible backup. They help competitors stay on course without stopping to acquire their azimuth with the more traditional compass. They are similar to the small compass attachments you can attach to your watch strap or embed in the top of your wooden walking stick.</p>",359.0
46,compression socks,"<h2>Types of compression socks</h2><p>All compression socks need to provide even force on your calves and feet, though not all socks are made alike. Because of the vascular benefits of this gear, they are useful in tons of situations. Depending on how you plan to use them, whether it's to relax and heal or kill it at your next workout, you'll need a specific type of compression socks.</p><h3>Graduated</h3><p>This type of socks is designed to provide the most amount of compression at the ankle, making them well-suited for athletic uses. The pressure reduces as the sock rises up the calf, making it easier to move around since your blood can flow readily. However, since these socks have such specific amounts of compression needed in exact places, it can be hard to find the right fit without a podiatric consultation.</p><p>The socks in this category generally end just below the knee and are able to limit the accrual of fluid in your legs called edema. If you plan to use these for exercise, it's worth seeking out extra features like moisture wicking and durability. Some models have reinforced heels and toes to limit wear and tear due to friction. These are ideal for runners and outdoor exercisers.</p><h3>Non-medical</h3><p>Some of the most popular amongst the modern population, these socks don't require a prescription though offer the same level of comfort for those without a medical condition. Typically, these are made out of nylon or polyester blended with spandex. The former gives durability and ventilation while the spandex provides the squeezing effect for which the socks are known.</p><p>Unlike other types, these socks provide a consistent amount of compression throughout the socks. As a result, these are preferred for use when at rest. If you are healing from an injury or worried about the pressure changes on an airplane ride, this is the type of sock to get. Generally, it is pretty easy to find a fit with these socks so long as you take a measurement of your calf and consult the sizing chart from the manufacturer.</p><h3>Medical</h3><p>These socks are less common, largely due to the fact that they are usually recommended through a prescription as opposed to the consumer seeking them out. The socks are meant to offer a high level of compression throughout the material. This is to assist in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis, a painful medical condition.</p><p>Similar to graduated compression socks, the amount of force applied to the foot and legs is not consistent across the socks. Like graduated models, the pressure is greatest at the ankles and lessens as the socks get closer to the knee. The mmHg (millimetres of mercury, a blood pressure measurement that refers to systolic over diastolic readings) will be highest on this type of sock.</p>",458.0
47,concealed carry holsters,"<h2>Types of concealed carry holsters</h2><p>There are four main categories of concealed carry holsters and they're named after the way in which you wear them. These include Outside the Waistband (OWB), Inside the Waistband (IWB), Appendix Inside the Waistband (AIWB), and shoulder.</p><h3>Outside the waistband (OWB)</h3><p>Outside the Waistband (OWB) is the most traditional way to carry a firearm. You wear an OWB holster on your belt much like a police officer. Since OWB is the standard for open carry, it may sound counterintuitive to use it for concealed carry. Yet, that problem is easily remedied with a jacket or big shirt. Otherwise, OWB is comfortable and gives you quick access to your firearm. It's ideal if you want to be active or carry a full-size handgun.</p><h3>Inside the waistband (IWB)</h3><p>Inside the waistband (IWB) sinks a holster below your belt line and inside your pants. IWB carry makes it insanely easy to conceal a firearm. In fact, the only portion of the gun that sits above the beltline is the pistol grip. Not all IWB holster have drawback. Some are built very well. Still, common issues people raise include discomfort as it might wedge between your belt and body; you might have difficulty accessing your firearm (especially if you don't train); and you might not always be able to reholster. Still, it's the most popular holster for concealed carry.</p><h3>Appendix (AIWB)</h3><p>Appendix carry (AIWB) is another form of inside the waistband carry, but it's so popular that it deserves its own category. It's when the rig sits at the front of your body, often on the left or right of your belt buckle, depending on which is your dominant side. Many prefer appendix carry because it provides more space for a full-size firearm or firearm with accessories. On top of that, it allows you to draw from a very natural position. The drawback, for many, is discomfort, especially if you have a belly. Still, many like it, including your humble author.</p><h3>Shoulder holsters</h3><p>Shoulder holsters sure seem cool and will certainly give you that Miami Vice vibe. They mostly come in handy when you're packing a large handgun. However, they do have several drawbacks. First, it places your firearm just below your armpit, so it's more susceptible to sweat and stink. Second, if you're unaccustomed to wearing a shoulder rig, it can be uncomfortable. And perhaps most importantly, there's a safety concern if you don't train, which is flagging your non-dominant arm when you draw. Still, this niche works well in situations where you're driving for long periods of time or up to your waist in, well, anything.</p>",430.0
48,coolers for camping,"<h2>Types of coolers for camping</h2><p>Coolers are pretty basic. They all use an outer shell and some kind of insulation to keep food and drinks cold. There's still some room for variation, though, so it's important to know what you're getting into. Are premium coolers worth the upcharge? Will a good, old styrofoam cooler from the gas station do the trick? We're here to answer life's important questions.</p><h3>Traditional coolers</h3><p>If your idea of a cooler is a big rectangle with a flat lid and a few built-in cup holders, you're not wrong. Most coolers look exactly like that and have for many years. It is the way. The reason most coolers fall into this category is simple: they work and they don't have to cost a lot.</p><p>These are great for group camping trips, tailgating, and backyard barbeques. They come in all different sizes and hold temperatures low for hours or even days. Ice is cheap, so we recommend buying the biggest size you think you're likely to use. One of these will ensure that you have safe, cold food for the whole group days into your camping trip.</p><h3>Portable coolers</h3><p>There are other options when carrying a full-sized cooler isn't practical. Portable coolers allow you to take a few drinks or a single meal on the go. These can be totes or backpacks that are great for picnics and small outings. A lot of people use these for lunchboxes because they eliminate the need for a refrigerator.</p><p>Because of their small size, portable coolers don't hold temperature as well as larger coolers. Their insulation is much thinner and it's usually necessary to use blocky ice packs rather than loose ice that can fill the cooler evenly. They're good for a few hours, but we wouldn't use most of them for much longer.</p><h3>Tubs and tanks</h3><p>If you've been to a big cookout, you've probably seen big, open containers filled with ice. Back in the day, we used corrugated tin water troughs. Now, people use cooler tubs with insulated walls to keep drinks accessible and cold. These coolers have huge amounts of space and make it easy for people to grab and go.</p><p>Tubs and tanks have one serious drawback: they violate the closed-lid rule. Without a lid, they burn through ice much faster and are constantly being bombarded by the hot sun. They make up for this in sheer size. Because they're so big, people can stuff a tremendous amount of ice inside and refill frequently.</p><h3>Power coolers</h3><p>If your style of camping takes you away from home for a long enough time, even the best cooler will let you down. If you can't refill your ice, you're out of luck––almost. Power coolers are effectively refrigerators that can be plugged into vehicles or generators (gas or solar) to stay cool indefinitely.</p><p>These are gaining popularity with car campers and overlanders because they allow people to enjoy meat, dairy, and cold drinks for weeks on end. Even when the power source is disconnected, they can hold their temperature for hours like a traditional cooler. This kind of luxury isn't cheap, but it's worth it to replace your beef jerky with freshly grilled steak.</p>",521.0
49,down jackets,"<h2>Types of down hackets</h2><p>There are a bajillion different down jackets on the market, and choosing the right one for you can be a bewildering experience. It's best to first think about what you'll use the jacket for before starting your search.</p><h3>Ultralight down jackets</h3><p>When you have to carry everything you need on your back for days over many miles, every ounce counts. Ultralight backpacking down jackets seek to provide the most warmth for the fewest ounces carried. These jackets tend to use the fluffiest down (800 to 1,000 fill) and have very thin 5D to 7D shells that aren't the most durable and require special care when wearing to avoid rips and snags.</p><p>They also have fewer features like chest pockets and adjustment points and tend to be the most expensive due to the high-performance materials used. These jackets generally weigh less than 10 ounces overall and have three to four ounces of down fill. They can be used as outer layers in warmer conditions and mid-layers in colder conditions.</p><h3>Midweight down jackets</h3><p>When you're not obsessed with eliminating every possible gram, you get more options in terms of features and warmth. Most midweight down jackets for backpacking use 600 (less fluffy) to 800 (more fluffy) power fill down and have a hood, two hand warmer pockets, a chest pocket or two, and adjustable hoods and hems. These won't be the absolute lightest jackets, but they're good tradeoffs in terms of warmth, weight, and features. Midweight jackets generally weigh between 12 and 15 ounces overall, with five to six ounces of down fill.</p><h3>Heavyweight down jackets</h3><p>These super warm jackets are designed for cold and windy conditions. They often sport weather-resistant shells, large baffled hoods, and more insulation for true winter conditions. These jackets typically weigh more than 20 ounces overall, with more than eight ounces of down fill, and are designed to keep you warm in the harshest conditions.</p>",314.0
50,first aid kits,"<h2>Types of first aid kits</h2><p>Imagine trying to administer care to a battlefield casualty with a home-oriented first aid kit. To the uninitiated, a first aid kit is a one-size-fits-all solution, but the reality is that first aid kits come in a variety of shapes and sizes with unique loadouts. Your individual setting(s), training, and the people around you directly affect what kind of first aid kit you will need. Choose wisely.</p><h3>Boo-boo kit</h3><p>The bare bones ""boo-boo kit"" wins the dubious distinction of being the most common ""first aid kit"" on the market today. Walk into any Walmart, Target, CVS, or Walgreens, and these kits will make up the bulk of available options before you. These low-cost kits tend to be small and compact, making them convenient for treating minor cuts, scrapes, headaches, and other low-key maladies.</p><p>In the truest sense, these kits barely qualify as first aid kits if at all, but they do fit nicely inside glove boxes, purses, and other tight spaces. Of course, one upside to this diminutive first aid kit is the lack of need for first aid training.</p><p>Along with manufacturer-dependent extras, a typical boo-boo kit will include the following essentials:</p><ul><li>Disposable sterile gloves</li><li>Alcohol wipes</li><li>Antibiotic/antibiotic wipes</li><li>Antiseptic/antiseptic wipes</li><li>Burn cream</li><li>Sting relief wipes</li><li>Adhesive bandages</li><li>Butterfly closures</li><li>Sterile gauze pads</li><li>Adhesive tape</li><li>First aid guide</li></ul><h3>General-purpose first aid kit</h3><p>Everyone should have a good general-purpose first aid kit kicking around the house or the car. While these kits do include the first aid equipment found in the most basic drug store kits, a boo-boo kit this is not. In our humble estimation, these kits are the bare minimum for most settings. General-purpose first aid kits provide proper care equipment for basic emergencies, such as light to medium bleeding, sprains, broken bones, and diabetic emergencies.</p><p>General-purpose first aid kits commonly appear in well-equipped homes and vehicles. Thankfully, basic first aid training usually is not required with these kits as they often include an adequate first aid guide. That said, don't skip basic first aid training if you can help it.</p><p>A good general-purpose first aid kit will include most or all of the following:</p><ul><li>All boo-boo kit essentials</li><li>Cotton swabs</li><li>Gauze rolls</li><li>Triangular bandage</li><li>Moleskin</li><li>Scissors/shears</li><li>Safety pins</li><li>Splint materials (fingers and/or limbs)</li><li>Thermometer</li><li>Tweezers</li><li>Cold pack</li><li>Emergency blanket</li><li>Glucose/sugar tablets</li><li>Acetaminophen (Tylenol)</li><li>Aspirin</li><li>Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin)</li><li>Plastic bag</li></ul><h3>Advanced first aid kit</h3><p>Emergencies requiring more than patching up common wounds and taming other routine maladies also require the use of an advanced first aid kit. These kits easily handle basic emergencies while also equipping first responders to respond to more traumatic injuries and to provide basic life support, making CPR equipment a crucial component. While you may know an EMT or other professional first responder who regularly carries a kit like this, these first aid kits are not the same as an EMT bag.</p><p>Advanced first aid kits include most or all of the supplies you would expect to find in a general-purpose kit but with a handful of critical extras. Other extras often include:</p><ul><li>Antihistamine</li><li>Compressed gauze</li><li>Trauma pads</li><li>Eye pads</li><li>Tourniquet</li><li>Saline/eye wash</li><li>Permanent marker/pen</li></ul><h3>Specialty first aid kit</h3><p>Specialty first aid kits are a breed all their own, and if you're a nerd like us, this is where things get fun. These first aid kits run the gamut in terms of both size and equipment and have equipment lists tailored to specific occupations, activities, or environments. Frequently, these kits are customized to address activity-specific injuries, handle traumatic injuries, and/or provide basic life support. Due to size and weight considerations, they also may decrease the amount of included ""boo-boo"" gear (think a military-issued IFAK).</p><p>Specialty first aid kits often come fully equipped with everything you'd expect in a general-purpose kit or even an advanced kit but with a number of extra ""goodies"", such as the decompression needles, QuikClot gauze, chest seals, or nasopharyngeal airways found in ""trauma kits"". Obviously, specific equipment lists will vary widely, and in many cases, the gear list will require specialized first aid training in order to be used properly. Make sure to train accordingly.</p>",639.0
51,fishing backpacks,"<h2>Types of fishing backpacks</h2><h3>Tackle backpack</h3><p>A tackle backpack is a fishing backpack built with the primary function of holding tackle trays of various sizes. For the purpose of this review, I based all of my criteria on the #3600 tray size, which is a medium-size tackle tray and fairly common. Many of the tackle backpacks are characterized by dividable inner chambers with upper and lower access flaps. This feature allows the user to keep their tackle trays stacked and separated in a separate compartment and not mixed in with other gear or camping necessities. Most tackle backpacks offer a generous amount of side pockets for additional gear such as line spools, spare reels, and all the other bits and pieces that accumulate with years of fishing.</p><h3>Sling backpack</h3><p>Geared for the more mobile fisherman, sling backpacks allow an angler to stay on the move. A tackle backpack is likely to be set down along the shore or in a boat, but the sling backpacks are usually meant for long-term wear and are geared toward fishermen who are constantly changing location, looking for that magical spot where all the fish are biting. Most sling backpacks are equipped to either be worn over the back, or strapped across the fisherman's front. The single strap allows the fisherman to easily slide the bag from their back to their chest, granting easy access to tackle without ever having to leave the water.</p><h3>Hip back</h3><p>Whoever said fanny packs went out of style never talked to a fisherman. Hip packs, like sling packs, are meant for constant wear, allowing the fisherman access to most of his vital gear without ever having to leave his position.</p><h3>Chest pack</h3><p>Generally geared to fly fishermen, chest packs are another great way to keep your gear accessible without having to trudge back into shore. Chest rigs tend to be a bit smaller than sling backpacks and hip packs in the interest of preserving range of motion during casting. It's for this reason that chest packs are usually marketed more toward fly fishermen, who generally require less tackle and equipment needs. If you're one to wade into deep water chasing trout, a chest pack is a good idea to keep your tackle high and dry.</p>",368.0
52,fleece jackets,"<h2>Types of fleece jackets</h2><p>Synthetic fleece jackets have been around since the early 1980s when Aaron Feuerstein invented Polartec, a polyester yarn woven into a thick fabric. His aim was to improve upon the insulating power of wool fibers by creating a material that was lightweight and warm even when damp. Patagonia was the first major retailer to use Polartec in its classic Synchilla jacket, and there have been more than 40 years of innovation since. Fleece jackets are generally categorized by weight: lightweight (100 g/m2), midweight (200 g/m2), and heavyweight (300 g/m2).</p><h3>Lightweight</h3><p>Lightweight fleece jackets are typically made from 100 weight Polartec and are sometimes referred to as R1 jackets. They are the most breathable and packable and offer moderate warmth. The 100 series jackets are typically designed for high output efforts like trail running, cross country skiing, and mountain biking.</p><h3>Midweight</h3><p>Midweight fleece jackets are typically made from 200 weight Polartec and are also called mid-layers. They can be worn as a jacket during cool temperatures or as an insulating layer over a base layer and under a windproof shell during colder temps. They are the most versatile of the bunch.</p><h3>Heavyweight</h3><p>Heavyweight fleece jackets are typically made from 300 (or greater) weight Polartec and are the warmest but also the least breathable. You don't see as many 300 or 400 weight jackets on the market anymore, as most people opt for lightweight down jackets or soft shells in lieu of these bulky and baggy outer layers.</p>",243.0
53,folding knives,"<h2>Types of folding knives</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Back in the day, pocket knives were used for everything from doctoring calves in the field to slicing up an apple at lunch. They had to be sharp, durable, and slim enough to fit in the front pocket of the owner's jeans. Classic design cues like bone handles and polished blades make these popular heirloom items. You can still get excellent examples from brands like Case, but they probably aren't what you're looking for in a military knife. Blades tend to be on the small side and require two hands to open.</p><h3>Tactical</h3><p>Today's folding knives offer a huge selection of tactical options. If you need weather-resistant materials, smooth operation, and a no-nonsense blade, this is where you need to be shopping. Tactical folding knives are sharp enough to make quick work of everything from 550 cord to MRE wrappers, strong enough to hack through thick underbrush, and sturdy enough to take a beating no matter where Uncle Sam sends you. Look for blades in the five-inch range with or without serration. Most offer some form of corrosion protection, whether in the materials themselves or with some kind of coating.</p><h3>Spring-assisted</h3><p>In addition to run-of-the-mill tactical features, many of the knives designed for military use incorporate a mechanism designed to make one-handed opening easier. Some spring-assisted knives can be opened with the touch of a button rather than the typical wrist-flick you're probably used to. No, these are not switchblades. It's never a bad idea to research knife regulations in your area, but odds are you won't run into problems with this kind of blade.</p>",264.0
54,gentlemans knife,"<h2>Types of gentleman knives</h2><p>There is a knife for every job, and this subset is no different. Don't strap on a hunting knife under your suit, and don't try to cut a steak with a folding knife. We represented the following categories on this list to make sure you're set up for success in a wide range of scenarios.</p><h3>Folding knives</h3><p>Even distinguished gentlemen need to cut something every now and then, and summoning help from someone who actually prepared isn't a great look. Folding knives afford the practicality you get from any pocket knife without the typical camouflage handles and tactical blades. Instead of features like serrated blades and heavy construction designed to function around deer camp, the knives in this gear guide offer contemporary style and an understated appearance.</p><p>These folding knives would fit right in at a whisky tasting or cigar night. They look great without drawing attention and being flashy. Make one of these part of your big-night-out EDC and we're sure you'll be glad you did.</p><h3>Hunting knives</h3><p>As a category, hunting knives are characterized by fixed blades, robust steel, and usually a length greater than what you'd get from a pocket knife. In spite of the name, they're remarkably capable in a wide range of situations from wilderness survival to cutting into a block of cheese for campfire burgers.</p><p>Lest you think gentlemen aren't interested in such things, some of the best knives we found for this list are fixed-blade hunting knives designed for life in the field. Don't bother babying these, because they're seriously tough and built to work. Odds are, you won't let go until it's time to pass your knife on as a family heirloom.</p><h3>Kitchen knives</h3><p>If you don't know how to cook, you're missing out. Everyone deserves a quality meal, and it's a lot easier to make that happen when you can prepare delicious meals from scratch, all by yourself. Being a good cook is also one of the best party tricks there is. Pick up a new hobby and welcome guests into your home with a freshly-prepared meal.</p><p>When you do, it helps with the ambiance if you aren't hacking away with some plastic-handled knife you got at the grocery store. Invest in a premium chef's knife to see what the fuss is all about. These are pricey items, but if you're a cooking enthusiast, you'll get your money's worth.</p>",392.0
55,gun cleaning kits,"<h2>Types of gun cleaning kits</h2><p>Gun cleaning kits come in all shapes and sizes, and shopping for one can be a bit overwhelming if you're new to the shooting world. As a general rule, there are two main types of gun cleaning kits: push-through and pull-through. Each has its unique strengths and weaknesses, so make sure you know what you need before you (legally) take possession of a new gun cleaning kit.</p><h3>Push-through</h3><p>The push-through gun cleaning kits are the most traditional setup and rely on a metal (steel, aluminum, brass, etc.) or synthetic (i.e., carbon fiber) cleaning rod to move various cleaning heads up and down the barrel. Often, these rods break down into multiple pieces to make storage easier and include a patch holder and at least one bore brush. (Other cleaning heads, such as mops, chamber brushes, and cleaning jags, usually are available for individual purchase.)</p><p>These kits require the user to remove the bolt or barrel from their gun in order to run brushes and other cleaning heads from the breach to the muzzle in order to prevent fouling, dirt, and other contaminants from collecting in and around the action, trigger, and magazine well. While it is possible to run the head in the opposite direction, make sure to use a muzzle guard to preserve the accuracy and position your gun so that contaminants fall away from your gun's internals.</p><h3>Pull-through</h3><p>While traditional push-through gun cleaning kits rely on a metal rod to push cleaning heads through the barrel, pull-through kits operate more like a ripcord and fall into one of two categories: cleaning cable or bore snake kits. Both operate similarly, but the devil is in the details.</p><p>Pull-through cable cleaning kits operate similarly to rod-based kits. They include a pull handle and an attachment point to accept screw-on cleaning heads. They may also include multiple screw-together cables for cleaning longer barrels, again mimicking cleaning rods.</p><p>On the other hand, bore snakes combine a thick, weighted pull cord, mop, and bore brush into a single component to streamline the cleaning process. They fit into much smaller packages than traditional cleaning kits, making them incredibly handy, although since they lack interchangeable cleaning heads, a single bore snake is limited to a single bore size.</p>",370.0
56,gun oils,"<h2>Types of gun oils</h2><p>There is more than one way to classify gun oils depending on use, delivery, and materials used. In the spirit of simplicity, I chose to classify the oil by its intended usage.</p><h3>Solvents</h3><p>If you're unfamiliar with solvents or have never heard of a solvent before, think cleaner. These are chemicals that dissolve other substances, specifically for cleaning purposes. When you fire a round, the carbon emitted from the burning of the gunpowder will accumulate in almost every nook and cranny of your gun. The buildup can be tough to remove, so using a solvent or soaking the parts in one will help dissolve the carbon buildup and make cleaning easier.</p><h3>Lubricants</h3><p>Nobody likes friction — it burns and is uncomfortable. Guns don't like it either, as bare metal to metal action has the potential to cause critical failures. We're talking broken pieces, worn down parts, or worse. To ensure the action works properly and smoothly, all you have to do is apply lubricating oil. These do not clean and are solely meant to prevent unwanted friction and heating of parts.</p><h3>Protectants</h3><p>Whether you're storing your gun for months at a time or shooting regularly, it's important to have oil that protects the metal from rusting or damage. These oils are designed to enter the pores of the metal or wood and fill them up. Some oils harden a little, a process called resinification. Filling the pores is what protects the material from oxidation or other chemicals, like skin oil, that break it down over time.</p>",253.0
57,headlamps,"<h2>Types of headlamps</h2><p>If you think all headlamps are the same, think again. There are plenty of options out there for all kinds of uses and budgets. We found headlamps designed for everyday practicality, tactical operations, and extreme sports. Before you add one to your cart, make sure you know the basics and can make an informed decision on what's right for you.</p><h3>Everyday</h3><p>Basic headlamps are designed to get the job done without spending a lot of money. They're affordable, reasonably capable, and use common batteries that you can find at any gas station or convenience store in a pinch.</p><p>This is a great way to replace whichever tired, old flashlight you're using now. Everyday headlamps are nice to have when you need to do chores after dark or DIY projects around the house. They can also save you from cussing out an unsuspecting child for not shining the flashlight at the right place when you're fixing your car. This kind of headlamp isn't the most advanced, but it's an upgrade over holding a normal flashlight.</p><h3>Camping</h3><p>A good headlamp is one of the best pieces of gear you can add to your camping pack. For starters, it's a lot safer to move around in the dark if your hands are free to move branches and catch yourself if you fall. Once you start putting your tent together and cooking dinner, a headlamp will make a world of difference.</p><p>Camping headlamps typically have multiple output settings so you can choose the right amount of light for the task at hand. Low settings are good for referencing a map or finding something in your pack, and high settings are great for moving safely after the sun goes down. They're usually lightweight and compact, which is important when you're moving on foot. You can also expect some degree of protection against water and impacts.</p><h3>Action sports</h3><p>Extreme sports require extreme gear. You wouldn't bomb down a dusky trail on your mountain bike with one hand holding a flashlight, and you shouldn't strap a substandard headlamp to your helmet either.</p><p>Extreme sports (and I consider tactical operations the most extreme sport) demand the best gear. Headlamps designed for this world come with various color and power settings, rechargeable batteries, and heavy-duty construction. They can burn brighter and longer in harsher environments than other headlamps. As a result, you can expect to pay top-dollar for one of these. That shouldn't dissuade you, though, because these are tools rather than gadgets.</p>",407.0
58,heated gloves,"<h2>Types of heated gloves</h2><p>You wouldn't wear gardening gloves to shred the gnar at your local ski area and you wouldn't try to drive to work wearing mittens fit for an arctic exploration mission. The same goes for heated gloves; you need to pick the right gear for the job. Don't worry, it isn't complicated and we did the homework for you.</p><h3>All-purpose heated gloves</h3><p>Why are you shopping for heated gloves in the first place? If your reasoning is that your hands are always cold, you need a glove that's comfortable doing everyday tasks like driving to work and running errands. Rugged, waterproof shells are nice to have but not necessary. You also don't need tons of insulation and a long-lasting battery.</p><p>The good news is that there are plenty of heated gloves that will do what you need them to do for a reasonable price. We found some great options for everyday use that barely crack the $100 barrier. In the world of heated gloves, that's pretty good.</p><h3>Specialized heated gloves</h3><p>If you have more specific plans for your heated gloves, you'll need to pick something that's up to the challenge. We found a few options that are great for skiing and snowboarding, hunting, and riding motorcycles. All of these provide capabilities beyond what basic heated gloves can offer.</p><p>These specialized gloves are designed with a specific activity in mind. Hunting gear needs to be camouflaged. Motorcycle gloves can't interfere with feeling the bike's controls. Winter sports require gloves that minimize hot chocolate breaks in the lodge. In any case, there's probably something out there for you if you know where to look.</p><h3>Heated liners</h3><p>Heated liners are ideal for people who plan on doing a lot of different things with their heated gloves. Liners slip into other gloves, mittens, or shells to make your battery-powered warmth more versatile. We found a great option from Hestra that you'll want to take everywhere you go.</p><p>The downside of heated liners is that they aren't meant to be worn alone. They offer little to no protection against water and wind, and they might even be damaged if you get them wet. You could probably get away with wearing them in the car or around town when the weather is cooperative, but most of the time you'll need to pair them with an appropriate shell.</p>",384.0
59,hiking boots,"<h2>Types of hiking boots</h2><p>Hiking is a pretty broad term. Our own writers hike things like the Appalachian Trail and Mount Rainier. Some people hike the local park in less time than it takes their pumpkin spice latte to get cold. Those styles of nature walks require footwear with very different features. Price is another consideration. There's no need to break the bank on boots for casual hikes, but more ambitious endeavors are worth springing for something high-end. We're here to break down some of the main factors you need to evaluate.</p><h3>Casual hiking boots</h3><p>What's on your feet right now? Unless you're wearing combat boots, I'll go out on a limb and guess that it's something soft, lightweight, and flexible. That seems to be a winning recipe for comfort, so it's how most shoes feel. Casual hiking boots are very similar. Since they don't need to deal with heavy packs, uneven terrain, and slippery surfaces, this kind of hiking boot can prioritize short-term comfort. They're great for weekend trips around the local trails, walking the dog, or going for even everyday use. Don't push your luck, though, because they aren't built to handle the kind of terrain and strain that comes with backpacking and serious climbing. Fortunately, they tend to be affordable and stylish enough to wear around town.</p><h3>Traditional hiking boots</h3><p>Traditional hiking boots up the ante with additional features that make them more wilderness-ready than casual hiking boots or trail running shoes. This meant using leather and chunky soles back in the day, but now we get to enjoy lightweight synthetics and more advanced tread patterns if we want. This style of boot costs more than something designed for fashion or casual hikes. Expect to pay at least $75, but potentially as much as $150 for a pair of dedicated hiking boots. For the extra money, you'll get footwear that can support your ankles and feet on uneven terrain. More aggressive tread patterns will boost confidence in mud and loose dirt. Because they're intended to have a rough and tumble service life, true hiking boots are also notably more durable and longer-lasting than budget options.</p><h3>Backpacking boots</h3><p>At the top of the hiking boot food chain are the apex predators that are backpacking boots. This style of boot is intended to do everything hiking boots do but under a heavy load. They need to provide enough structure to prevent you from rolling an ankle and be comfortable and supportive without getting packed out under load. They need to keep your feet dry because it might be days until you can get back to the trailhead and change into something else. Accomplishing all this can make a boot quite heavy, which is the last thing you want on a backpacking trip. Solving that problem involves advanced materials that cost a pretty penny, so it isn't uncommon to see backpacking boots going for more than $200. They're worth it for serious hiking, though. Get a few days into a week-long backpacking trip, and I bet you'll agree.</p>",501.0
60,hiking pants for men,"<h2>Types of hiking pants for men</h2><p>All hiking pants are designed to be functional, but that can take on a few different meanings. Rather than narrowing your search down to a specific brand, focus on what you plan on doing in your new hiking pants. Hikes that involve climbing, mountaineering, or tactical training will require different pants than hikes that are strictly about walking from point A to point B.</p><h3>Tactical pants</h3><p>If your hikes involve any kind of firing range, small unit tactics, or hunting permit, tactical pants are probably the best bet when it comes to hiking pants. The foundation is still there––they're lightweight, breathable, and built to last. As with any specialized hiking pant, the devil's in the details.</p><p>Tactical pants prioritize range of movement. In addition to walking and running, they need to facilitate the more dynamic movements of climbing over obstacles and getting into various standing, kneeling, or prone shooting positions. They may include stash pockets for small items like keys and identification tags. Many tactical pants are designed for government contractors, so they tend to be understated and appropriate for wear around town.</p><h3>Climbing pants</h3><p>Would you rather hike in climbing pants or scale a cliff in generic hiking pants? That's a no-brainer. If your hikes involve travel that's more vertical than horizontal, you need dedicated climbing pants.</p><p>Pants built for rock climbing take mobility to an extreme to account for the physical feats you perform every time your feet leave the ground. They also need to be lightweight and strong enough to hold up to days of being scraped along a rock face. Pockets are less important since you'll likely be carrying nothing more than a chalk bag. Fit is up for debate. Some climbers like loose pants that flow with them, and others like tighter pants that stay out of the way.</p><h3>Convertible pants</h3><p>Laugh it up; we can hear the jokes already. Is the world ready for the onslaught of sex appeal that comes from a grown man turning his pants into shorts? Maybe not, but convertible pants serve a legitimate purpose in the field, whether people admit it or not. If that's your thing, we have you covered (or uncovered, depending on how you wear them).</p><p>Convertible pants are great for climates that experience fluctuating temperatures. If you've ever used your car's heater and air conditioning on the same day, you know the feeling. Plenty of hikes start with frost on the ground and end with blazing sun. Convertible pants let you keep moving without digging a change of clothes out of your pack and carrying more gear than you need to.</p>",432.0
61,hiking pants for women,"<h2>Types of hiking pants for women</h2><p>There are three basic types of hiking pants for women, but all of them are designed to protect your legs from the elements. Which type you prefer will most likely be influenced by your budget, the season in which you plan to hike, and the terrain. Hiking pants can shield your legs from bugs, brambles, the sun, rain, and the cold to varying degrees depending on the type, so choose your pants wisely. No matter what type of pants you prefer, look for options that fit close to the body with a good deal of stretch in the fabric, articulated knees, and a gusseted crotch for maximum freedom of movement through the backcountry.</p><h3>Regular hiking pants</h3><p>Don't be fooled by the name ""regular hiking pants."" They aren't to be confused with regular pants like jeans made from materials that may not wick sweat and moisture from the skin. Hiking pants, a relatively recent innovation in the outdoor world, are specifically designed to be lightweight, breathable, and water-resistant. What we mean when we refer to regular hiking pants are those offering basic protection from the elements while also being stretchy, but won't necessarily keep you warm during cold-weather activities. Regular hiking pants may have zip-off lower legs or roll up, and come in loose or tighter fits, as well as tall and petite lengths.</p><h3>Softshell hiking pants</h3><p>Softshell hiking pants provide the same benefits as a good pair of regular hiking pants in terms of protecting you from the elements, but they expand your range of comfort during chilly outdoor activities thanks to their marginally heavier weight and available brushed cloth lining for added warmth. Softshell hiking pants also tend to be slightly less form-fitting than regular hiking pants, making them ideal for wearing a base layer underneath. Like regular hiking pants, soft shell hiking pants are not waterproof but can be worn under hard shell rain pants for added protection from rain and snow.</p><h3>Leggings</h3><p>OK people, I have a confession to make. I am cheap when it comes to buying clothing for outdoor activities, which is pretty counterintuitive considering how much time I spend doing stuff outside. When I hike in the summer, I generally do so in the same shorts I wear for running, and during the winter, my go-to base layer staple are my running leggings, which I frequently wear under my softshell hiking pants for added warmth and wind protection. Because of their stretch, moisture-wicking power, and insulating ability, I am a huge believer in wearing leggings for hiking. Some companies have started making tights specifically for hiking that offer reinforced panels on the knees and rear end or made from abrasion-resistant fabric for greater durability and protection from rocks and thorns. Arc'teryx Oriel Leggings are a great example of a versatile legging that can take you from trail to rock wall with ease and minimum scrapes. In my book, the only thing regular hiking pants have on leggings is the depth and quantity of their pockets, which sadly, leggings tend to lack.</p>",506.0
62,binoculars for hunting,"<h2>Types of hunting binoculars</h2><h3>Roof prism binoculars</h3><p>Binoculars aren't just about the lenses. Each set of binoculars contains a set of prisms whose primary function is to invert the image collected by the concave lenses, therefore returning it to be ""right-side-up"" before delivering it to the user's eye. There are two prism types common in hunting binoculars: roof prism and Porro prism.</p><p>The roof prism type contains prisms within the binoculars that are set in a straight line or overlapping fashion. This allows the objective lenses to be directly in line with the eyepieces and means the binoculars can be built with a more compact, linear design. Roof prism binoculars have become the most popular in the field of hunting, purely because of its ease of carry and more compact build.</p><h3>Porro prism binoculars</h3><p>The Porro prism type contains two prisms offset from one another, which means the objective lenses are set wider than the eyepieces, making these binoculars bulkier and cumbersome. Without a doubt, the Porro prism type binoculars offer better optical qualities and brighter/clearer images, but there's just no getting around the practicality of the roof prism binos when it comes to hunting.</p><h3>Compact binoculars</h3><p>Compact binoculars are certainly great when it comes to reducing weight in your pack or around your neck, and there are many great pairs that can fit most of your hunting needs. The thing with compact binoculars is that when you make the trade-off for a smaller size, you're usually looking at small objective lenses (somewhere around the 25mm range is typical). Having smaller objective lenses isn't the end of the world, but it does mean that less light will be collected and your overall image will be less bright and vivid.</p><h3>Long-range binoculars</h3><p>With long-range binoculars, you're usually going to go the opposite way with size. Longer ranges usually require higher magnification and larger objective lenses (12x magnification and up and usually 50mm diameter objective lenses). While these can be great when you're poring over valleys from a high peak, you'll probably want a tripod of some sort to get the best result. Most long-range binoculars are equipped to handle a tripod attachment, so there shouldn't be any issue there.</p><h3>Low-light binoculars</h3><p>Low-light binoculars tend to incorporate a lot of other subtypes because there are several different methods for improving light transmission within a set of binos. For instance, many types of Porro prism binos are considered low-light binoculars simply because their prism structure is specifically designed to maximize light transmission. Other binoculars could be considered low-light binoculars due to the size of their objective lenses and even further due to complex, and often proprietary, lens coatings that are specifically engineered to maximize light transmission.</p>",442.0
63,hunting knives,"<h2>Types of hunting knives</h2><p>Hunting knives encompass a lot of different things, and we spread the love to represent a lot of different styles and tastes on this list. In each case, there's a reason why we chose what we did. Here's a breakdown of which factors you need to consider and some of the information we used to get in the right headspace for this guide.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>Hunting knives have typically used a fixed blade, and that's still true in most cases. Many of the tasks hunting knives are expected to do require a fair amount of force, so being rigid allows them to hold up to the abuse. The lack of any moving parts makes them much stronger than folders.</p><p>In terms of size, fixed-blade knives are generally larger than folding knives. That's fine in this case because hunters don't need to restrict themselves to knives that fit in a pocket. Large blades are useful when setting up a blind, breaking down big game, and doing chores around the campsite.</p><p>We also can't overlook the maintenance our gear requires. Keeping a fixed-blade knife in peak shape is as simple as sharpening, oiling the steel, and maybe rubbing some wax into the handle.</p><h3>Folding</h3><p>The biggest advantage folding knives possess is their compact size. One of our favorites is the Benchmade North Fork, which folds down to a closed length of 3.9 inches. With its slim handle and movable pocket clip, it's a wonderful, high-end EDC or backup to your primary hunting knife.</p><p>No matter what kind of mechanism a folding knife uses, it's never as strong as a solid piece of metal. Folders aren't well-suited to more rigorous tasks like breaking down large game animals.</p><p>All the small moving parts that allow a folding knife to open and close get filled with gunk, too. Using one as a hunting knife will result in sticky blood and all kinds of other nastiness gumming up the works. That requires stripping the knife down to individual components, cleaning each one, and (worst of all) putting it all back together.</p>",340.0
64,hydration bladders,"<h2>Types of hydration bladders</h2><h3>Durable hydration bladders</h3><p>Since hydration bladders can be known for leaking, it's important to go for a durable model. Lucky for us, most of the top-of-the-line models today are both reliable and affordable. Their thick plastic materials can handle being pressed against a hiker's back or squished in a pack, without the plastic seams bursting.</p><p>Options like the Platypus Big Zip EVO Reservoir, the Source Outdoor Widepac, and the CamelBak Crux Reservoir are all known to be long-lasting and puncture-resistant. The HydraPak HydraSleeve is perhaps the most durable option on this list, as it can even be strapped on to the outside of a pack without getting damaged.</p><h3>Ultralight hydration bladders</h3><p>Hydration bladders most frequently weigh between five and 10 ounces, and while that may not seem like a large range, when you're a marathon runner, cutting a few ounces can make a difference. Ultralight bladders can also be good for backpackers, skiers, or anyone else looking for a lightweight option. Our pick for lightweight adventures is the Hydrapak Shape-Shift Reservoir, which weighs only 5.40 ounces, though it does sacrifice some durability to cut those few ounces.</p><p>Keep in mind that, while you can lose a few ounces in your bladder, the water it's carrying is the weight you'll notice. If you are looking to cut down on weight, try only keeping a liter or two of water in your bladder and filling up every couple miles, if you have water sources available.</p><h3>Insulated hydration bladders</h3><p>Have you ever heard someone complain about taking a hydration bladder snowmobiling or skiing, only to have the water freeze before being able to drink any? I sure have, and that's why I find insulated bladders so useful. In addition to keeping your water from freezing, these bladders will keep your beverage ice cold on a hot summer day.</p><p>Our pick for the best insulated hydration bladder is the HydraPak HydraSleeve, which provides extreme versatility when it comes to using it for different activities. If you go with another option on our list, most brands sell insulated tubes separately, which you can sub out for your bladder's normal tube if need be.</p>",353.0
65,indoor cycling bikes,"<h2>Types of indoor cycling bikes</h2><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Originally, indoor cycling was designed to provide a similar workout to what you'd get from a road bike without leaving the house or gym. As you increase your budget, you'll get access to more adjustable features, like seats and handlebars, and higher-end components, like pedals and drivetrains.</p><p>We include upright and recumbent bikes in this category. All forms of traditional spin bikes can provide you with a good workout at a fairly reasonable price, but some are better than others. Yes, sitting on a cushy seat with a backrest is more comfortable than being perched on a skinny bicycle seat, but it's not the best way to challenge your body. For this guide, we focused our search on machines that mimic a real bicycle.</p><h3>Interactive</h3><p>The next step in the evolution of indoor cycling was the introduction of online classes. Peloton gets the credit for this fitness craze, but competition is catching on and there are several solid alternatives from brands like NordicTrack, Echelon, and Bowflex on the market now. Some even move to simulate hills or lean into a turn.</p><p>The advantage of each of these bikes is a massive catalog of live and on-demand classes, scenic rides, and data-tracking tools. These features come with a monthly subscription fee, but the benefit is undeniable. If you're serious about indoor cycling or training for riding season, this is a fantastic way to go. Just be prepared for extra up-front and recurring costs.</p><h3>Trainers</h3><p>No, we're not talking about people who come into your home and yell at you. Trainers are possibly the oldest indoor cycling tool. These compact devices attach to your bicycle to let you ride it like a stationary bike indoors. The bare-bones approach doesn't offer as many features as other styles and does require you to own a bicycle, but the advantage is getting more seat time on your primary ride.</p><p>There are two styles of trainers. One sits under your bicycle and is powered by the rear tire as you pedal. The other requires removing the rear wheel and chain so you can use a built-in cassette that becomes part of your bike's drivetrain. Both styles have advantages and disadvantages, and which you choose will ultimately come down to personal preference. We chose a wheel-on style for this guide because of its ease of use.</p>",386.0
66,iphone wallet case,"<h2>Types of iPhone wallet cases</h2><p>iPhone cases come in many styles, materials, and shapes –and so do wallet-style cases. There are a ton of options available to choose from, and there's truly something for every kind of iPhone user. Whether you're looking for something sleek and slim or something larger and more akin to a full-size wallet, it's all possible. You can learn more about some of the most common types of iPhone wallet cases here.</p><h3>Slim iPhone wallet cases</h3><p>Slim iPhone wallet cases are the most streamlined and pocket-friendly option available. These cases aim to reduce the overall size of your phone in its case, keeping it as close to your iPhone's original size as possible. So, these cases typically feature a few card and cash slots, which are often placed at the back of the case.</p><p>The one downside to a slim case is that your cards are typically a bit exposed. Because this kind of case tends to put your cards on the back of your phone, they can be left a little open to the world at large. While they're pretty secure, this can be a disadvantage to some.</p><h3>Folio iPhone wallet cases</h3><p>Folio iPhone wallet cases are larger and a bit bulkier. They wrap your entire phone in protection, covering it from back to front edges. This kind of wallet case features a folio, or a flap, that folds over your iPhone's screen and covers it. On the interior side of this flap is the wallet — it includes card and cash slots. These types of cases often also include small zippered pockets to hold change or other very small items.</p><p>Folio wallet cases offer more of a full-size and traditional wallet that's attached to your iPhone. However, they can be bulky and tricky to fit in some pockets. These cases also require you to physically open them in order to use your phone, which some might find to be a drawback.</p><h3>Stick-on iPhone wallet cases</h3><p>Stick-on iPhone wallet cases are a kind of quick and easy case solution. In fact, they aren't really even full cases in the traditional sense. This kind of iPhone wallet doesn't cover the entire back and sides of your phone; instead, it's a slim piece of plastic, polyurethane, or leather that sticks right onto the backside of your phone. It includes card slots so you can slide in cash or cards and carry them right on your iPhone.</p><p>Because stick-on wallet cases aren't anything like a traditional case, they can't protect your phone if you drop it. These little wallets can, however, be stuck onto some cases, allowing you to combine protection with convenience.</p>",435.0
67,karambit knives,"<h2>Types of karambits</h2><p>Karambits come in many different forms and sizes. No matter what task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, it's probable that you'll be able to find a blade that suits your needs. Whether you're a Kali practitioner or in need of an EDC/utility knife, there are options for you at pretty much every price point.</p><h3>Fixed-blade</h3><p>A fixed blade is any knife with a blade that is ""fixed"" in place, meaning that it doesn't have a pivot and is firmly, immovably attached to the handle. They're essentially the opposite of pocket knives. The blade is always exposed unless it's sheathed. They're simple, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly due to the absence of a confusing locking mechanism. Fixed-blades can be double- or single-edged.</p><h3>Folder</h3><p>Also referred to as a pocket knife, a folder is a compact knife that features one or more blades that fold up into the handle in lieu of using a bulky sheath. Meant to fit easily inside your pocket, these knives are legal to carry in most places, and are convenient to carry and use daily. They are frequently smaller than fixed blades, with blades typically between three and four inches long, although there are many exceptions that are both longer and shorter than this. Folding karambits are also limited to being single-edged, due to the spine of the blade always being exposed. However, they're quite handy — they can do everything from peeling an apple to cutting rope or canvas to opening packages. Though these folding knives are typically smaller and not as strong as their fixed blade siblings, they're highly versatile.</p><h3>Trainer</h3><p>These are commonly used for practice and training as a notably safer substitute for ""live blades,"" i.e., knives that are sharp. Typically, trainers are made of rubber or plastic, though unsharpened, blunted metal training blades do exist.</p>",308.0
68,long range scopes,"<h2>Types of long-range scopes</h2><p>Selecting the proper scope for long-range shooting starts with knowing what kinds of products the market has to offer. The vast majority of modern rifle scopes are variable power optics, but fixed power scopes still pop up from time to time. Both scope types can be solid choices for traditional long-range shooting, but if you need to hit targets at extreme distances, then an extreme long-range scope is an absolutely essential piece of gear.</p><h3>Variable power long-range scope</h3><p>By and large, the vast majority of rifle scopes on today's market are variable power optics, and the same is true for the long-range submarket. To anyone not already in the know, a variable power scope allows the shooter to adjust how much magnification their scope can provide, increasing the optic's versatility.</p><p>Some shooters want a scope dedicated entirely to long-range shooting, but the majority of people need something a bit more flexible. These scopes are easy to identify with the ""x to x"" markings. For example, a scope with a magnification range between five and 15 times magnification will be listed as a ""5-15x"" or ""5-15"" scope. For long-range shooting, look for a variable power optic with a magnification range that spans across the 10x power mark, such as a 5-15x power.</p><h3>Fixed power long-range scope</h3><p>While variable-power scopes dominate the market, fixed-power scopes have managed to maintain a minor foothold in the long-range optics world. Compared to variable-power optics, fixed-power scopes are inflexible, and as such, are becoming increasingly rare. Still, they provide a lightweight, inexpensive, and mechanically simple option for long-range shooters.</p><p>Fixed-power long-range scopes feature high magnification, yet, they manage to avoid going overboard. Most often, these optics come with 10x or 12x magnification and, within certain ranges, can provide a reasonable balance between situational awareness and accuracy potential. (Real-life accuracy is up to the shooter.)</p><p>Probably the biggest draw to fixed-power long-range scopes (other than simplicity, weight, and price) is nostalgia for bygone eras. If you want to ring steel at 1,000 meters with an old school optic, then a fixed-power scope is the way to go.</p><h3>Extreme long-range scope</h3><p>Typically, long-range shooters engage targets anywhere between 600 and 1,000 meters and call it a day. Since most shooters are lucky to hit steel much beyond 200 meters, these numbers certainly are noteworthy, but there are always those who want to take things to the next level. While the definition of ""extreme long-range shooting"" varies somewhat from shooter to shooter and from caliber to caliber, marksmen and women who attempt to hit targets beyond the 1,200-meter mark should be equipped with an extreme long-range rifle scope before they pull any triggers.</p><p>Generally speaking, extreme range scopes are heavy, variable power optics with a magnification range starting out at around 7-10x and typically maxing out at 25-35x, although some may have an even higher top end. Specialty reticles are common features as well as high MOA/MIL adjustment ranges. Of course, at multi-mile ranges, special scope mounts become a true need. (Unfortunately, such speciality devices are outside the scope of this buying guide.)</p>",507.0
69,lpvo scopes,"<h2>Types of LPVOs</h2><h3>First focal plane</h3><p>First or front focal plane scopes place the reticle in front of the scope's erector. This creates the effect of the reticle growing and shrinking as magnification increases or decreases. Nothing actually grows or shrinks, and the magnification just makes it appear to occur.</p><p>Modern LPVO reticles often feature markings for bullet drop and windage and tools like rangefinders. These markings are measurements typically in MOA or MILs. The benefit to an FFP scope is that these measurements remain the same regardless of the magnification range, allowing them to remain accurate at any magnification.</p><p>With LPVOs in particular, the illuminated portions and reticles shrink at lower settings. This gives the illuminated portion a red dot-like small size, and since the main reticle shrinks, it's not obstructing your vision for close-quarter shooting.</p><h3>Second focal plane</h3><p>Second focal plane scopes place the reticle behind the scope's erector. This has the effect of the reticle remaining the same size throughout the magnification range. Since the magnification changes but the reticle does not, the measurements in MOA or MIL are often only accurate at one magnification level. This is often, but not always, the highest level of magnification.</p><p>In the world of LPVOs, this can limit your capabilities with high-powered magnified optics. If it's a 1-8X or 1-10X, you want an FFP reticle, and depending on the reticle design for a 1-6X, you might want FFP as well. If you use a 1-4X or even 1.5-5X, then an SFP will likely be perfectly capable.</p><p>LPVOs with lower power and simple reticles can benefit from benign SFP optics. For example, the Trijicon Accupoint's triangle reticle benefits from remaining the same size as magnification increases due to its large size.</p>",282.0
70,mag pouches for plate carriers,"<h2>Types of mag pouches for plate carriers</h2><p>When we're looking at mag pouches specifically for attaching to a plate carrier, there isn't a lot of variety.</p><h3>Basic</h3><p>Basic mag pouches are one, two, or three magazines in a single row that rides close to the plate carrier. These are the basic design of mag pouches and prevent unwanted bulk. Many of these feature MOLLE webbing on the front for you to customize the kit with. Where basic mag pouches excel is that they keep mags close to your body and help spread out the load.</p><h3>Stackers</h3><p>These are bulkier than basic mag pouches because they feature a second row of mag pouches in the front. Two-by-one, two-by-two, or two-by-three, these increase the number of magazines you can carry in a consolidated form. The mags can be staggered at different heights, or ride at the same height with different levels of fabric on the pouches. These are ideal for anyone needing to carry a large number of magazines.</p><h3>Kangaroo</h3><p>Named after the marsupial that carries its young in a stomach pouch, kangaroo mag pouches have additional pouches integral to the front. These are commonly pistol mag pouches so that warfighters with secondaries don't have to find more accessories. However, the kangaroo feature could also be an admin, radio, or grenade pouch. These are versatile-styled pouches for anyone with wide mission scopes.</p>",223.0
71,molle pouches,"<h2>Types of magazine pouches</h2><p>Magazine pouches come in several configurations, only some of which are covered here. However, I'm going to do a quick rundown on the different types, what they're usually used for, and their generalized pros and cons. In general, the types of magazine pouches can be broken down into four major groups: cloth, thermoplastic, hybrid, and leather, with the first three represented in some way on this list.</p><h3>Cloth</h3><p>These are the simplest, and often most cost-effective types of pouches on the market. At their core, they're a cloth bag, usually made of nylon Cordura, with some sort of closure on top, be it a velcro flap, a snap flap, a bungee, or some other mechanism. These pouches are also the most common on the surplus market, having been around since the advent of MOLLE, and so they can be had for very cheap if you're on a budget. The advantages that they have is that they usually work well with at least one of most magazines, and that they're fairly easy to use for re-indexing. The disadvantage is that generally their flap closures can get in the way during reloads, and they have no form of inherent retention beyond the flap.</p><h3>Thermoplastic</h3><p>These pouches (or carriers as I prefer to call them, since they aren't actually a bag) are made of flexible thermoplastic, which is a substance that includes the Kydex family of materials. This allows manufacturers to mold magazine carriers to specific magazines, firearms, and other implements, and have them securely held with no need for other retention in most cases. The advantage to this type of carrier is that they offer positive retention with no need for bungees, straps, or flaps, and instead rely on friction from the molded plastic to hold the magazine in place, which makes them some of the fastest on the list. The downside to these is that they're often only compatible with one or two types of magazine, and aren't flexible in allowing non-standard types of magazines, should you be a weirdo who uses G36 magazines or AUG magazines.</p><h3>Hybrid</h3><p>These pouches use a combination of cloth and other materials to provide their retention, whether through the use of gripping material, elastic tension, thermoplastic inserts, or some other type of solution. These pouches seek to offer a ""best of both worlds"" approach, and often include both thermoplastic liners and some other form of optional retention. The advantage to these pouches is that they solve the biggest issue with many of the purely cloth or purely thermoplastic options, providing a mixture of retention and flexibility. The disadvantage is largely that they inherit some of the issues of both cloth and plastic magazine carriers and the fact that they're oftentimes still very pricey.</p><h3>Leather</h3><p>This isn't an option that I discussed on this list, largely for the reason that we were speaking about rifle magazines, and the fact that I wanted every pouch on this list to have some sort of military usage. Leather is possibly the oldest ammo carrying solution, oftentimes offering intricately embossed designs, brass hardware, and other stylish choices. The advantages of leather largely boil down to style and comfort. Not much looks nicer than well-tanned and finished leather, and it's very comfortable to wear on your belt in a concealment environment. Additionally, this may be the only option for pouches if you're in a law enforcement environment, due to departmental restrictions or a desire for uniformity. The disadvantage of leather is that it doesn't play well with moisture, doesn't offer the cost-effectiveness of cloth or the rock-solid retention of thermoplastic, and has limited options for securing the pouch.</p>",602.0
72,night vision goggles,"<h2>Types of night vision devices</h2><p>Before you start throwing money at a night vision setup, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the technology available in the context of your own needs. Augee Kim, vice president at Tactical Night Vision Company, had some good advice when we talked to him.</p><p>""Generally speaking, when we talk to customers, our advice is to balance requirements with budget,"" Kim said. ""While obviously everyone always wants the best, night vision is not inexpensive, and a realistic budget is very often an important factor. This advice applies to both commercial and government/law enforcement customers.</p><p>""Long story short, customers should ask themselves: ‘What do I want/need to do?' and ‘How much can I realistically spend for these capabilities?' To me, this is the most important and critical — and, sadly, overlooked aspect of night vision buying — so many people are dazzled by what is popular on social media, or what special operations is using, etc., and don't think as critically about their own needs and requirements, and let that drive their purchasing decisions.</p><p>""From there, we can get into a whole lot more detail, and one of the things that TNVC excels in is consulting with individual users about their requirements and what products are available to meet those requirements within their budget and being able to provide a tailored solution to meet their needs.""</p><h3>Helmet-mounted night vision devices</h3><p>The vast majority of night vision devices will end up on a helmet. We say helmet-mounted rather than head-mounted because strapping a device to your head just isn't stable enough for real-world use. Even if you don't spend big bucks on a ballistic helmet, having a rigid, stable foundation will make all the difference.</p><p>The interface between your helmet and night vision device starts with the hard shroud that will mount directly to the front of your helmet. Think of it as a low-profile quick release. That's where you'll clip in your mounting system. Finally, an arm will attach to your NVG. If you want to make things easy and cost-effective, U.S. Night Vision has packaged everything you need (including a laser) at a heavy discount right here. All that gear is fairly heavy, so some people like to add ballast weight (or better yet, a remote battery) to the back of their helmet to balance the load. It's heavier that way, but at least the force is coming straight down and not yanking your face toward the deck.</p><p>It's a lot of information to take in. Planning out the right setup for you will take time and it's important to get it right. Once you're done, you can buy with confidence knowing that you have quality gear that's backed by a warranty and will come through for you when you need it most.</p><h3>Handheld night vision devices</h3><p>Going handheld is by far the cheapest way to enter the night vision arena. If you want to see in the dark without role-playing your favorite YouTube operator, you can get by with a basic digital night vision monocular or binoculars like the ATN BinoX.</p><p>These devices are not compatible with weapons, so nights at your local shooting range are out of the question unless you just want to creep from the peanut gallery. They're also lousy for moving, so get used to being in a static position. If you're good with those drawbacks, you can absolutely use these devices to observe your surroundings. They can be very useful for hunters who sit in a hide and scan for predators or hogs until it's time to switch to the next type of night vision device on our list.</p><h3>Night vision scopes</h3><p>You would-be Ricky Recons out there might be wondering to yourself, ""If all I want to do is shoot in the dark, why do I need all this high-speed mobile gear?"" The answer is that you don't. Plenty of hunters set up and call in predators at night, and they're taking (relatively) known-distance shots from a static position. Oftentimes, they're reaching out far beyond what anyone with NODS and a laser would attempt.</p><p>What you need in that kind of situation is a night vision scope. Something like the Bering Optics D760 Gladius can provide a six-power magnified, illuminated image. That's enough power to make precision shots at serious distances for nighttime shooting. Another option is to pair a clip-on night vision device like the Knight's Armament UNS-A3 with your existing, compatible optic.</p>",730.0
73,office chair,"<h2>Types of office chairs</h2><h3>Ergonomic</h3><p>One of the most popular types of chairs is those with an ergonomic structure. These models are designed to help you avoid musculoskeletal issues related to staying seated for extended periods. By promoting posture through lumbar support, cushioning, and armrests, these chairs limit fatigue and facilitate improved circulation. Though a bit higher on the pricing spectrum, these chairs are a good way to go if you spend long hours at the office.</p><h3>Executive</h3><p>If you are looking for a chair with a professional look, this type has a lot to offer. You can easily spot them through the high back, prominent neck support, and regal appearance. These chairs feature ample cushioning and have a substantial amount of lumbar and arm support. While they have some ergonomic features, fewer parts of these chairs are adjustable. As a result, this type is good for business meetings and working in shorter spurts.</p><h3>Mesh</h3><p>If your office is in a poorly ventilated area, mesh office chairs have a lot of advantages. Per the namesake, the back of the chair is made out of mesh. Breathing well in all cases, most are structured to offer back support and promote circulation. There is a wide variety of these chairs available, though most have wheeled bases and a top that swivels. Though the mesh back limits lumbar support adjustability, you can usually change the height of the chair's base and the armrests.</p>",234.0
74,plasma lighters,"<h2>Types of plasma lighters</h2><p>Aside from shape and size, plasma lighters are essentially all very similar. They all use a battery to generate intense, controlled heat. Some are built to withstand the elements and others are better suited to a candlelight dinner, but the components are largely the same. The main difference that affects performance is the number of arcs used to generate enough heat to spark a flame.</p><h3>Single-arc plasma lighters</h3><p>At a minimum, a plasma lighter must have two points separated by a small enough gap that an electrical charge can cross the gap, but far enough apart that whatever you're trying to light can fit between them. These two points create a single band of heat, called an arc. Arcs appear as purple light and are very hot.</p><p>This method generates quite a bit of heat, but applications can be limited. Candle wicks and small pieces of tinder are no problem, but the kind of damp material you might encounter at a campsite might present too much of a challenge for a single arc. Size can also be an issue. Lighting a cigarette with a single arc is easy enough, but cigars and pipes might require something larger.</p><h3>Dual-arc plasma lighters</h3><p>For a little bit more money, you can get a plasma lighter with two arcs instead of one. This configuration creates an X-shaped arc pattern that results in more heat than a single-arc plasma lighter would produce. Some combined arcs also produce enough to insert into the bowl of a pipe, which can be difficult with most single-arc plasma lighters.</p><p>This is what we recommend for most outdoor activities. Having two arcs instead of one gives you more power to work with and adds a layer of redundancy that's valuable when you're far removed from civilization. All our picks for camping and survival settings use two arcs.</p>",304.0
75,pocket knives,"<h2>Types of pocket knives</h2><p>To many people, a pocket knife is just a knife, a simple tool for a simple job. The fact of the matter is, however, that a pocket knife is much like a wrench than a fork or a spoon. Just as you would pick a crescent wrench over an oil filter wrench to turn a bolt, you would also choose a rescue pocket knife over a woodworking knife to free someone from a burning car at the scene of an accident if you had the choice. Choosing the right pocket knife for you has much more to do with your daily life than most might imagine.</p><h3>EDC knife</h3><p>An EDC pocket knife is the (usually) single-blade alternative to the multitool. Like a multitool, this traditional design provides users with a combination of durability and capability, but these pocket knives lack all the folding extras, such as screwdrivers and pliers. Often, this design uses a clip point, drop point, or tanto blade with either a straight or half-straight, half-serrated edge in order to provide the best all-around performance for accomplishing common, everyday tasks.</p><p>A reliable, practical EDC pocket knife includes a handful of valuable features as well. A lightweight knife rides nicely in the pocket, while a pocket clip is particularly valuable for EDC use, especially removable/multi-position and deep-carry clips. After all, if you can't access your knife quickly and easily, why bother carrying it at all?</p><h3>Outdoorsman's knife</h3><p>Outdoorsmen of all kinds rely on their knives for any number of common duties. The outdoorsman's knife includes any number of hunting knives and survival knives, each with its own unique abilities.</p><p>Not surprisingly, hunting knives are excellent tools for field dressing game and usually include finer clip point blades. Hunting pocket knives are often intended for cleaning and skinning small game or as a backup to a dedicated fixed blade hunting knife.</p><p>Survival knives tend to be tougher and more versatile and often employ a slightly wider variety of blade patterns, such as drop point, clip point, and tanto shapes. These knives are tough and have a bit more flex than most other blades in order to withstand the abuses that come with outdoor use.</p><h3>Rescue knife</h3><p>Rescue knives are a breed of their own. This design is tough and durable like its tactical, EDC brother, but they rely on radically different features. Often, rescue blades feature a sheepsfoot or other blunt-tip pattern for use in safely cutting clothing or other materials located close to flesh and bone. Serrated blades, seat belt cutters, glass breakers, high-visibility coloring, extreme blade hardening, and salt resistance are other common features that first responders and emergency personnel will require from their knives.</p><p>Some ""rescue knives"" fall somewhere between the rescue and EDC or tactical knife categories with features from both. Usually, the key difference between these multi-purpose knives and professional-grade rescue knives is the blade shape. Instead of a sheepsfoot or similar blade shape, these knives usually will feature clip point, drop point, tanto blades instead, requiring more careful use in emergency situations. Of course, these knives frequently include glass breakers and seat belt cutters.</p><h3>Self-defense knife</h3><p>As the name implies, the self-defense knife exists primarily for use in life-threatening situations when retreat is no longer an option. This (usually) straight-edged design is tough and durable yet exists with a single purpose in mind, ignoring unnecessary extras. While most self-defense blades rely on fixed blades with their stiff blade design, a folding self-defense knife may be the best or only option for a given use case.</p><p>Commonly, self-defense blades rely on blade patterns that lend themselves to thrusting and slashing motions. Frequently, these knives rely on tanto, spear point, Bowie, and hawksbill or talon blades to accomplish their mission. Often, these knives emphasize an aggressive yet muted aesthetic and often only do one task well: fighting.</p><h3>Tactical Knife</h3><p>The tactical knife attempts to combine the versatility of an EDC knife with the capabilities of the self-defense knife. Like the fixed-blade Ka-Bar first issued to U.S. Marines in the Pacific Theater of World War II, this knife design can accomplish everyday tasks with ease, is tough enough for more demanding roles that require leverage, and, in a pinch, can be used defensively.</p><p>Most often, tactical pocket knives employ drop point or tanto blades in place of more specialized patterns, increasing their versatility. These knives usually come in ""tactical"" colors that adhere to various uniform regulations, such as tan, green, black, and gray, and their blades always include a reflection-resistant finish, such as black oxide.</p><h3>Woodworking Knife</h3><p>For many of us, our first pocket knife was a woodworking knife, such as a Buck or an Old Timer. The woodworking pocket knife design is a multi-blade take on the traditional folder and usually boasts two or three blades with each featuring a different length and pattern than the other(s). This design makes for an excellent EDC knife thanks to a variety of specialized blades that can complete a variety of tasks better than a single jack-of-all-trades blade.</p><p>A woodworking pocket knife's most common blade designs include some combination of the clip point, pen, straight back, spey, sheepsfoot, and wharncliffe blades. In addition to its own specific blade combination, this pocket knife may also include very specialized tools, such as a hook blade, nail puller, gouge, scorp, and even a chisel. When it comes to woodworking, the more the merrier!</p>",885.0
76,power racks,"<h2>Types of power racks</h2><p>When a new lifter walks into a serious gym (one where chalk isn't just allowed, it's readily available) for the first time, learning about all the equipment can be overwhelming. Why are some of these racks open and some are like cages? What's with the rainbow plates? Is that guy taking a hit of smelling salts?</p><p>Power racks can take several forms, but the truth is that they're all used in similar ways. Let's establish what's what so you know which one is right for your home gym.</p><h3>Full rack</h3><p>Most power racks use four vertical posts, attached with horizontal beams at the top and bottom, to create a cage. The vertical posts feature a series of holes on either two or four sides to allow attachments to be positioned at varying heights. The first attachment you'll need is a set of hooks to hold the bar while you load it and rest in between sets. The second is a pair of bars or straps that can catch the weight if you fail the lift. These need to be placed just below the lowest point in the bar's path.</p><p>Full racks are incredibly stable and, as a result, excellent for heavier weights. The safety mechanism can catch the bar if you drop it. The posts prevent it from falling away from the rack. Because full racks are so strong, you'll often see them come with a pull-up bar, as well. If you have room in your home gym (and budget) for a full rack, it's what we recommend.</p><h3>Half rack</h3><p>Half racks use two vertical posts rather than four (unless there's a place to store plates, but that doesn't count). Hooks and safety bars are still present, though, so these are very safe for everything from squatting to benching and overhead pressing. Some people prefer the easy access afforded by an open setup. As with full racks, you'll be able to adjust the height of your attachments in most cases.</p><p>One advantage of half racks is a lower cost of entry. They're a great way to save a few hundred dollars and offer very similar capability to that of a full rack. Some even come with storage options for your plates. If you're comfortable lifting outside of a four-post rack and want to keep some change in your pocket, this is a great way to go.</p><h3>Squat stand</h3><p>Squat stands are the simplest and least expensive type of rack. You might notice that they tend to be placed in the Olympic weightlifting area of many gyms. The Rep Fitness squat stand we chose for this gear guide is more customizable than most, with adjustable hooks, a pull-up bar, and settings that are low enough to bench with.</p><p>Features tend to be minimal, so you'll need to find someplace else to store your plates. It's also worth pointing out that squat stands often don't include safety bars. That doesn't have to be a deterrent, but you need to be aware of the extra risk you're assuming by not using one.</p><h3>Monolift</h3><p>We didn't include a monolift on this list because they're extremely expensive, specialized equipment that most gyms don't even have. Monolifts are typically used during powerlifting meets and extremely heavy workouts. When you use a monolift, you don't unrack the weight and step away from the rack to perform the squat. Instead, you set your feet in position to squat, unrack the weight, and the hooks move out of the way for you. Once the squat is complete, the hooks return into position to grab the bar.</p><p>A monolift definitely isn't the kind of thing we'd expect to see in a home gym. But they are awesome, and you should check one out if you get the chance. Just do your homework so you look like you know what you're doing.</p>",631.0
77,punching bags,"<h2>Types of punching bags</h2><p>While there are different styles of punching bags, which vary by how you're supposed to strike them, the types of punching bags we're covering here involve how you set them up.</p><h3>Hanging</h3><p>A hanging bag is most likely what you picture when you think about a punching bag. It hangs from an anchor from above and dangles using chains or straps. Most hanging bags will swing during your workout and force you to move accordingly. The really heavy ones — usually designed for power punching — need more force to move, so they won't swing as much.</p><p>Additionally, if you have a bag lighter than 70 pounds and you don't want it to swing, or you have something like a double-end bag, you should anchor it to the floor as well as the ceiling.</p><h3>Standing</h3><p>A standing punching bag eliminates the need for an anchor point or hanging stand. They are stationary bags that are built onto a base that stabilizes them. That base is filled with sand or water to ensure not even One-Punch Man can knock it down.</p><p>Standing bags can be a great alternative to hanging bags when your space is limited or you might live somewhere you are not allowed or cannot safely anchor a punching bag. A standing bag can be tucked into a corner and only pulled out when needed.</p>",223.0
78,rain boots,"<h2>Types of rain boots</h2><p>It may come as a surprise to some that rain boots come in a variety of different styles, each with its own intended purpose. While some rain boots are purely utilitarian footwear made with traditional uses in mind, others are made for style, a specific use case, or sometimes, a combination of both. Generally speaking, most rain boots fall into one of the following categories: Wellington, casual, winter, outdoor, and work.</p><h3>Wellington boots</h3><p>Rubber Wellingtons are the original rain boots, based on an original boot design by Arthur Wellesley, the first Duke of Wellington. Originally a leather boot, the Wellington boot made its rubberized debut in 1853, thanks to British industrialist Hiram Hutchinson. Rubber Wellingtons quickly became a staple on farms through the western world and served with distinction in two world wars, earning a victory against both the Germans and trench foot. This design is so ubiquitous today that many non-traditional rain boots, such as waterproof hunting boots, use a Wellington-based pattern.</p><p>These tall slip-on boots come with varying degrees of rubber thickness, and many are insulated for use in frigid temperatures. In North America, Wellington boots go by a variety of names, including ""galoshes,"" and when most Americans think of rain boots, these rubber kicks usually come to mind first.</p><p>While not technically true Wellington boots, most mid-height boots use the Wellington style with a shorter shaft. These ""Wellingtons"" are easier to don and doff and provide most people with more than enough protection against the elements.</p><h3>Ankle-high rain boots</h3><p>Despite the glorious history of the rubber Wellington, the style-conscious desk jockey wouldn't be caught dead in a pair of squeaky, knee-high boots, but when the boss calls them into the office after the next Hurricane Katrina has left a city-sized puddle in its wake, rainstorm chic could wreak havoc on a fashionista's self-respect. Of course, an ankle-high pair of waterproof Chelseas or some other sleek, low-profile rain boots would do perfectly for the occasion.</p><p>Many ankle-high rain boots feature leather or synthetic leather crafted into a lace-less pull-on boot with enough waterproofing to keep your feet dry as you wade through one flooded parking lot after another. Whether you need something sleek yet cozy for a trip to the office or a night on the town, an ankle-high rain boot will likely be your best bet.</p><h3>Winter rain boots</h3><p>The most miserable places on earth include Antarctica, the Sahara, and any place with freezing rain. As such, winter rain boots make the difference between extreme misery and tolerable misery for many users. That said, these rain boots can handle more than just a frigid winter deluge. In fact, many of these boots are better designed for handling two feet of fluffy white powder than for six inches of water, although they will easily keep both at bay.</p><p>Winter rain boots employ a waterproof rubber construction and, often, some variant of the traditional Wellington boot with its tall, slip-on design. These boots also feature insulation and a good bit of traction for slick, icy surfaces.</p><h3>Work rain boots</h3><p>Waterproof work boots take the rain boot concept to a new level. Rather than providing wearers with enough boot to withstand the occasional urban rainstorm, these boots were built to take a beating without compromising their original purpose.</p><p>Many work rain boots feature added safety and comfort features, such as insulated neoprene shafts or steel toe caps. For example, the insulated Muck Boots Arctic Pro Steel Toe comes with a steel toe and plate, making this pair of boots a solid choice for working with livestock during a Montana winter or navigating the deck of a North Atlantic trawler. The main downside to these features is the extra weight they add to already heavy rain boots.</p><h3>Hunting rain boots</h3><p>While similar to other rain boots, hunting rain boots come with their own unique characteristics. Like most rain boots, the majority of hunting rain boots feature a tough rubber construction, and like winter rain boots, they often include insulating materials, such as neoprene or Thinsulate. That said, this insulation may be heavier duty than typical winter rain boots as hunters (especially waterfowl hunters) often find themselves immobile in cold, wet conditions.</p><p>Like some work rain boots, hunting rain boots tend to include more aggressive tread patterns than some rain boots. Due to the need to traverse slick, uneven terrain, such as marshlands or flooded forests, hunters need to trust that their boots will keep them upright and mobile in the most demanding of conditions.</p>",740.0
79,range bags,"<h2>Types of range bags</h2><p>You wouldn't bring a rifle to shoot skeet and you wouldn't draw a pistol from the 500-yard line, so don't bother with the wrong type of range bag, either. Every range bag is designed for a specific type of shooting, so make sure you buy one that's right for you.</p><h3>Soft cases</h3><p>The most accessible range bags are essentially soft pistol cases with dedicated storage for small items like magazines, earplugs, and maybe a very compact cleaning kit. They're great for a pistol session at a range where targets are provided but fall short when you start adding multiple firearms and larger items.</p><p>Compared to hard cases, these are lighter, more affordable, and typically accommodate MOLLE attachments. The drawback is that soft cases don't offer the same level of protection as hard cases. They leave your gear susceptible to impacts and are less secure than a locked hard case.</p><h3>Backpacks</h3><p>We've used backpacks since grade school, so why not keep the tradition alive? This type of range bag is practical, offers generous amounts of space, and keeps our hands free. They're great for situations where you have separate cases for your firearms or are moving between dispersed firing positions.</p><p>Most backpacks built for the range include easy-access compartments for handguns. Some come with soft cases for individual handguns so you can easily grab the one you want. Storage for long guns is less common, although there are rifle cases that can be worn like a backpack.</p><h3>Duffel bags</h3><p>These are the one-stop-shops of range bags. Throw your ammunition, cleaning gear, ear and eye protection, targets, stapler, extra magazines, range book, and even pistol cases in a duffel, and be on your way. Some even have room for disassembled long guns. If you want to make one purchase and be done with it, this is the style of range bag for you.</p><p>With this much space, it's easy to get carried away and pack more weight than you really want to lug around. Throwing a bunch of weight on one shoulder isn't the most efficient way to distribute weight on your body, so be mindful when you choose your loadout for the day.</p>",356.0
80,rechargeable flashlights,"<h2>Types of rechargeable flashlights</h2><p>Flashlights come in many different forms, and that doesn't change just because the power source became reusable. The difference between different types of rechargeable flashlights starts with the intended use. When we put this list together, we made a point to represent the most popular styles of flashlight and the background information to make informed decisions about them.</p><h3>EDC</h3><p>Most flashlights can probably fall into the everyday carry category. This is a pretty broad term, and modern flashlights pack so much power into a small size that most of the options on this list could reasonably be carried as part of your EDC.</p><p>To qualify as an EDC item, we think a flashlight needs to be portable, reliable, and easy to use. We're not fans of throwing money away on cheap gear that's likely to break, so anything that's going to recommend our endorsement for EDC duty needs to be durable and high-performing. That means build quality, lumen output, and features all get put under the microscope.</p><h3>Headlamps</h3><p>There are certainly times when holding a flashlight in your hand isn't ideal. Headlamps are a great way to get work done in the dark, whether you're doing home repairs in the attic or pitching a tent after a long day of hiking. Rechargeable options eliminate the need to carry batteries around at work or on the trail, and they can even be charged up using a solar bank.</p><p>Generally speaking, the activities that call for a headlamp aren't particularly gentle on gear. We prefer headlamps that can withstand drops, harsh temperatures, and at least some amount of water. If you want to really nerd out, check out our headlamp-specific gear guide.</p><h3>Searchlights</h3><p>Searchlights are the heavy-duty workhorse of this group. They house enough power to blast through the darkness with the kind of brightness you'd get from your car's high beams. Considering the times you'd need to use one of these behemoths, we only considered options that are rugged enough to join into a search party during an emergency.</p><p>A byproduct of all the power is size. Searchlights are much larger and heavier than other flashlights and should be kept in your home or vehicle rather than a hiking pack or bug out bag. They're not very practical for day-to-day use, but when you need one, you need it badly.</p>",383.0
81,reloading kit,"<h2>Types of reloading kits</h2><p>Reloading isn't complicated, but it does require attention to detail. The first step is acquiring all the right pieces. The best way to start is with a well-equipped kit. Once you have a quality press, scale, and tools, you can add dies for the specific calibers you plan on reloading.</p><p>Once you have a kit, you'll need raw materials. Casings, primers, powder, and bullets can be found in a wide range of specifications to help you create the ideal load. There are also accessories like case tumblers, brass catchers, and tutorials to make the whole process easier.</p><h3>Press</h3><p>The first thing you'll need to start reloading is a press. Loading ammunition requires precision, and you need a tool that can install a primer, load powder, and press a bullet in place safely, securely, and with incredible consistency.</p><p>The presses on our list use a die to hold each casing firmly in place. By activating a handheld lever, you can apply pressure straight on in exactly the correct place. Compact presses require more finesse, but take up less space and are relatively inexpensive. Table presses make the whole reloading process much faster and help prevent mistakes. A good press isn't cheap, but we consider it a necessary investment for anyone interested in reloading.</p><h3>Accessories</h3><p>Once you have a press and set up your workstation, it's time to add a few accessories that are specific to what you want to accomplish. If you want to reuse spent brass, a catcher mounted to your rifle can make range cleanup a breeze. Because the casings never hit the ground, you won't have to worry about picking up one that's been stepped on or dented. Add a tumbler and breathe new life into used casings by cleaning them far better than you could by hand.</p><p>Finally, we recommend continuously developing your knowledge and skill. Don't just rely on personal experience. Regularly learning about the science of reloading with a well-selected book can make you safer and more successful.</p><h3>Consumables</h3><p>Lastly, you'll need the materials to reload your own ammunition. Casings can be purchased or, at times, reused. They aren't reusable forever, though, so keep track of which have been fired previously and which are new. Primers are single-use items, so you'll need to keep plenty in stock.</p><p>Gunpowder is far from uniform, so do some research to determine which powders perform best in the applications you're likely to encounter. It should go without saying but always weigh your powder carefully to ensure safe and accurate ammunition.</p><p>Finally, the bullets you use will affect performance and cost. There's no need to waste high-dollar hunting bullets on paper targets, and you wouldn't want to take range-day bulk products into the field. We recommend investing in some of both, but save the good stuff until you have your reloading skills dialed in.</p>",466.0
82,rooftop cargo carriers,"<h2>Types of rooftop cargo carriers</h2><p>There are many designs for carrying cargo on the roof, and the truth is this option is not for everyone. Even more crucial to your decision-making is what you will be carrying and how frequently you'll need to use the box. Let's take a look at these factors so you can make an educated decision.</p><h3>Hardshell</h3><p>When most people think of roof boxes, a hardshell rooftop cargo carrier is what they picture. They are made from materials or fibers that have been molded or formed into a hard container. The biggest benefit of this type of carrier is that they tend to be the most weatherproof. Because they are formed, it makes storing gear in them easier, and many feature straps to secure small gear when it isn't fully loaded. While most only open from one side, many can open from either side. These styled boxes are slightly more secure than softshell carriers since they can be locked and aren't sliceable.</p><h3>Softshell</h3><p>A softshell carrier is made from a fabric that doesn't maintain its form when empty. This material tends to be treated to weatherproof it, but this isn't a guarantee that your gear will stay dry. Most of these will use zippers and open in a specific way. One advantage is that these can mount easier than hard-shell carriers, but they're not as secure since the fabric could be cut.</p><h3>Open frame/specific frame</h3><p>There are many baskets and specific use cargo carriers out there that are an option. Baskets are frames that mount to your roof and will allow you to carry custom load-outs, but they require webbing or straps to secure the gear into the basket. Examples of specific carriers are rooftop bike racks and ski racks that only carry bikes or skis. These are great options for carrying the specific tool you need, but they don't offer versatility.</p>",309.0
83,rooftop tents,"<h2>Types of rooftop tents</h2><p>Rooftop tents are pretty straightforward, but there are a few key differences that can help you narrow down your search. The most obvious requirement is size. You'll need to find something that fits your needs and your vehicle. Tent construction plays a role too, so pay attention to how each one goes from folded-up to ready-to-use. There are also accessories available to customize your rooftop tent, so factor that in when you're making your initial purchase.</p><p>Soft-shell rooftop tents are basically traditional tents that mount to your car. They're relatively light and easy to set up compared to their hard-shell alternatives. They also breathe well and stay cooler during the summer. On the other hand, they're nowhere near as durable or aerodynamic as a slick, hard-shell tent.</p><p>Having a hard shell on your rooftop tent adds protection against the elements, whether you're parked for the night or blasting down the highway. Although they tend to be heavy, they make up for it to some degree with improved aerodynamics. Let's be honest, any rooftop tent is going to have a negative effect on your fuel economy.</p><p>Both styles are viable options, so do a little digging if you still aren't sure which is right for you.</p><h3>Pop up vs. fold out</h3><p>How your tent goes about its butterfly-like transformation also has an effect on the amount of real estate you're left with. Pop-up tents are a snap to set up because they just extend vertically. When you're ready to go, just collapse the walls and attach the roof to the floor. This means that what you see is what you get in terms of floor space.</p><p>Fold-out tents offer much more floor space––think double. This structural origami is more complicated than the alternative and constrains you to soft-shell designs, but you'll benefit from much more space, both in terms of square footage and headroom. If you camp with a group, this is the way to go.</p><h3>Add-ons</h3><p>As is tradition, there's also way more gear to acquire. Annex tents add enclosed space beneath a fold-out tent, which is great for storage or getting dressed. Some are large enough to sleep in, so you can bring more friends as long as someone's willing to call dibs on the bottom bunk. Annexes are generally tent-specific.</p><p>Awnings add protection from the sun and rain. They're usually compatible with a range of rooftop tents, and sometimes can be used on their own. Setting them up is as easy as unrolling them and attaching a pole at the two outer corners. Some even have screens to keep the bugs away.</p>",428.0
84,shooting ear protection,"<h2>Types of shooting ear protection</h2><p>Shooting ear protection comes in four major categories: unpowered earplugs, unpowered earmuffs, powered in-ear, and powered over-the-ear, also known as ""circumaural"" hearing protection. These options bring their specific capabilities to the table. In general, unpowered hearing protection will be cheaper and can be a good option for doubling up on hearing protection in high-noise areas, such as those on a flight line or near loud explosions. In terms of powered hearing protection, over-the-ear will generally be cheaper than in-ear options, as the latter requires more complicated and small circuitry to function.</p><h3>Unpowered earplugs</h3><p>Unpowered earplugs are the shooting hearing protection most people are familiar with. They usually come in the form of shapeable foam earplugs and are often inexpensive (in fact, most ranges give them out for free). However, these can range from ""foamies"" to options like the Surefire Sonic Defenders, and specialized musician's earplugs that lower the overall sound level without muffling the sound, which allows you to still have some clarity to your hearing even with these on.</p><p>These are a great option for those who want to double up under a powered headset, which is something I commonly see people on flight lines do, or the cannoneers at my unit, standing next to their M777A2 howitzers. Additionally, many shooters prefer these because they do not disrupt your cheek weld at all when shouldering a rifle. Unfortunately, these have issues with coming loose or popping out for some people and can get lost easily due to their small size.</p><h3>Unpowered earmuffs</h3><p>Unpowered earmuff-type hearing protection provides a more secure level of hearing protection than unpowered earplugs. They're quicker and easier to take on and off and require none of the fidgeting needed to stick earplugs in. In general, these offer similar sound reduction levels to earplugs, but some can even rival high-end earplugs with noise reduction rates of 30 dB or more. The downside to these is that they can be bulky, and prevent you from hearing, muffling nearly everything and offering no real specialized options to allow some sound in, but not others.</p><h3>Powered in-ear</h3><p>Powered in-ear hearing protection is an option for people who hate sweaty ears. They allow you to be aware of your surroundings without having to use cumbersome earmuffs. In general, these will be more expensive, due to the smaller circuitry needed to provide the ambient hearing features in such a tiny package.</p><p>Additionally, many have higher noise reduction rates than powered over-the-ear headsets, due to their use of multi-flanged or other specialized ear tips, which allow them to physically block sound better. They offer the same ease of use as unpowered earplugs but also the same drawbacks.</p><h3>Powered over-the-ear</h3><p>Powered over-the-ear hearing protection is what most people think of when they think of powered hearing protection, given the popularity of options like Peltor Comtacs. They offer auditory situational awareness while offering much the same fit as conventional earmuffs. They're generally the go-to option for communication headsets as well, offering both hearing protection and a convenient way to communicate via radio. Many of them can be mounted to a high-cut helmet for easy wear, and some even offer options to readily switch between headband, neckband, and helmet mount configurations. The downside to these is that like conventional earmuffs, they can get very hot in the summer months, which can lead to user discomfort.</p>",554.0
85,shoulder holsters,"<h2>Types of shoulder holsters</h2><p>There are several styles of shoulder holsters, and each has its advantages and disadvantages. The obvious task is narrowing your search to options that are compatible with the weapon you plan to carry. Next, decide if you're more likely to wear a shoulder holster for open or concealed carry. Finally, think about your body type and consider which option will be the most comfortable in real-world use.</p><h3>Horizontal vs. vertical vs. angled shoulder holsters</h3><p>The main difference that separates shoulder holsters from one another is the orientation of the holster itself. <br/><br/>Horizontal shoulder holsters are a long-time favorite because they work well for concealed carry. Keeping the barrel of your handgun parallel to the deck results in a smooth draw that's relatively fast. Just remember that you can only conceal handguns with an overall length that's smaller than the depth of your torso. Another drawback is flagging everyone behind you the whole time you're carrying. This hasn't stopped people from successfully using this method for decades, but it's a consideration you need to know about. Expect to have a chat with the safety officer if you use this style of holster at the range.</p><p>Vertical shoulder holsters eliminate the flagging issue by pointing the muzzle down, and they also accommodate larger handguns. If you want to conceal a big wheel-gun like the ones people carry in bear country, this might be your only option. While vertical shoulder holsters are better than their horizontal counterparts in those aspects, they're also slower to draw from.</p><p>Angled shoulder holsters strike a happy middle ground. Roto holsters that pivot once unlocked are popular because they allow you to carry your handgun vertically but draw it horizontally. This is all subject to personal preferences, but you can get a pretty solid understanding of which will work best for you by considering the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p><p>No self-respecting TV detective would be caught using anything other than a leather shoulder holster. Leather is still the most popular material for modern shoulder holsters and harnesses because it's comfortable, firm, and can last a lifetime if you treat it right. Harnesses, in particular, tend to be leather because of the way it feels. Leather molds to your body over time to create a fit that's second to none. That breaking-in process is critical when it comes to holsters because it means that the day you buy your holster is the tightest it will ever hold your firearm. Be patient and don't overdo it. If you have any slop, the fit isn't ideal. When properly formed, a leather holster will be very forgiving to your handgun's finish and will provide a smooth, quiet draw.</p><p>Synthetic holsters are gaining in popularity because they don't require a break-in period or maintenance. They're also affordable to mass-produce with incredible consistency. Several of our staffers won't use anything but a good Kydex holster. We chose reputable brands for this gear guide because not all Kydex products are built to the same standard. Never try to modify your holster to fit better, and — in the name of all that is holy — don't try to make it fit a handgun it wasn't designed for.</p><p>Nylon holsters and harnesses are available at very low prices — there's a reason for that. They tend to be less durable and less comfortable, so we prefer to stick to leather and Kydex.</p>",563.0
86,sleeping bags,"<h2>Types of sleeping bags</h2><p>The types of sleeping bags essentially boil down to three categories based on their intended use. If you don't need protection against cold, windy nights, there's no need for anything more than a basic sleeping bag. If you're embarking on a wilderness expedition, you need the best there is. Most people need something in the middle.</p><h3>Basic</h3><p>Entry-level sleeping bags use basic materials and simple designs to keep costs down. Remember the sleeping bag you had as a kid? That's not too different from what we're talking about.</p><p>Basic sleeping bags' rectangular shape is nice and roomy, but it's not very efficient at containing warmth. Padding is also limited, so these are best for temperate climates and indoor use. Materials also tend to be on the inexpensive side and prioritize softness, so don't expect much in the way of breathability. If you're essentially looking for portable bedding, these are the way to go. They're also extremely affordable, so you can outfit the whole family on a limited budget.</p><h3>Three-season</h3><p>Most people in the market for a sleeping bag want gear that can keep them warm and dry on the trail, then pack down to the size of a cantaloupe to fit in the bottom of their pack. It's no wonder, then, that most of the sleeping bags you see here are aimed at doing just that.</p><p>These sleeping bags use high-end synthetic materials that are strong, but light. Their insulation is very good at keeping warmth close to your body while allowing moisture to be wicked away. The mummy shape is common in this category because it's energy-efficient and saves a few ounces compared to a larger, rectangular sleeping bag. Compression sacks make packing up a stress-free affair. Just cram the sleeping bag inside little by little and use the straps to tighten it into a compact ball.</p><h3>Cold-weather</h3><p>Most sleeping bags can handle fairly cold weather––as cold as most people will encounter––but you'll need something built for the cold when temperatures drop below zero. These hardcore sleeping bags are a game-changer.</p><p>Cold-weather sleeping bags use good insulation and plenty of it. They're noticeably thicker and heavier than other sleeping bags. The outer shell may be extra thick to block out freezing wind, snow, and ice. Because of the expensive materials that go into building each one, cold-weather bags can be extremely expensive. That's ok because they don't just need to keep you comfortable — they need to keep you alive.</p>",405.0
87,spotting scopes,"<h2>Types of spotting scopes</h2><p>Spotting scopes can be categorized by their construction. The way they're built determines which advantages and disadvantages you'll be working with, so it's important to understand what you're getting into. None of the factors we break down are better or worse than one another, they're just different. As you do your research, pay attention to whether a spotting scope is straight or angled. Most use unmarked glass, but some feature a reticle that can be used to gauge distances or make shot adjustments.</p><h3>Straight spotting scopes</h3><p>Straight spotting scopes look similar to a large rifle scope or a small telescope. Many hunters prefer them because their slim shape is easy to pack. This style also allows fast target acquisition because you can line them up before going to the glass. You can also keep a lower profile, which is good in hunting and tactical situations.</p><p>On the downside, they're awkward to use on an incline (but more comfortable facing downhill). If you're part of a group that will be sharing the optic, people of different heights will have a harder time getting to eye level with a straight spotting scope.</p><h3>Angled spotting scopes</h3><p>Angled spotting scopes are generally shorter end-to-end, but they take up more space than a straight scope. Many people find that bending over an angled eyepiece is easier than getting behind a straight one. A lot of guides attach cameras or digital displays to their spotting scopes, and this type of setup works much better with an angled eyepiece.</p><p>The tradeoff to being easier to use on an incline is that angled spotting scopes require serious neck contortions to use on a decline. They can also be cumbersome to use when mounted to a vehicle's window. You'll also have to be more mindful of snow and rain accumulating on the eyepiece.</p><h3>Spotting scopes with a reticle</h3><p>The vast majority of spotting scopes use an unmarked reticle. They provide an unobstructed view of the target. Some, on the other hand, include a reticle similar to what you'd see on a rifle scope. There are various styles, including MIL and MOA markings. A reticle can be used to estimate range and is especially useful when talking a shooter onto a target.</p><p>Having a reticle on your spotting scope seems like a significant advantage, but most people choose not to use one. Finding this kind of scope takes a little bit of digging, and using one effectively requires practice. We were able to track one down for this gear guide (and at a great price, we might add), but most spotting scopes use unmarked lenses to provide a clear view.</p>",434.0
88,survival knives,"<h2>Types of survival knives</h2><p>There are several large categories that survival knives can be sorted into. These aren't hard and fast, and oftentimes a knife can fit into more than one category, so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt. The types that I've chosen are bushcraft knives, hunting knives, fighting knives, camp knives, pack knives, and machetes. Some have been featured on this list, and most, especially the Gerber LMF II, are designed to fill multiple roles.</p><h3>Bushcraft knives</h3><p>Bushcraft knives are purpose-built to enable survivalists to make shelter, fire, and tools using the environment around them. To this end, they will often feature blades with a strong bevel to bite into various types of wood, a full tang to prevent snapping when the blade gets caught or when used to hack through a log, jimping and a finger choil of some sort, comfortable grips, and a thick spine to aid batoning.</p><h3>Hunting knives</h3><p>Hunting knives encompass a wide variety of blades, ranging from caping knives, dedicated skinning knives, boning knives, filet knives, and so on. Generally speaking, hunting knives will be designed to aid in the cleaning and dressing of game, ranging from varmint species such as rabbits to elk, bear, buffalo, and other large animals. Knives with a deeper belly are good for skinning, as they allow you to cut ahead of your knuckles, which aids in getting into hard-to-reach parts of a carcass. These knives should also be made of steel that stands up well to the corrosive effects of blood and that stays sharp for long periods of time, and feature grips that remain tactile even when slick with bodily fluids, which is a consideration for particularly greasy animals like fattened bear or javelina. Some applications such as fishing necessitate additional considerations, such as corrosion resistance.</p><h3>Fighting knives</h3><p>These knives are made for exactly what it says on the box: fighting. They range from the Japanese tanto blades of yore to the Sikes-Fairbairn dagger, the U.S. Marine Corps Ka-Bar, the M3, and many, many more. I didn't include any purpose-built fighting knives on this list, as I generally find most of them to be less-than-optimal for survival use. However, any of the knives on this list will likely work in a pinch if you have to put a wallop on someone in a fight.</p><p>That being said, true fighting knives generally feature blades that are designed for their intended use, such as stabbing in the case of the M3 or Sikes-Fairbairn, slashing with the Ka-Bar, or hacking with the venerable Gurkha Kukri knife. These knives need to be weighted according to their purpose, e.g. to aid in hacking with the kukri, and need comfortable grips that aid manipulation in a high-stress, hand-to-hand environment and that mitigate shock vibration from contacting equipment, protective equipment, or bone.</p><h3>Camp and pack knives</h3><p>Camp and pack knives are the domestic tool of survival knives, not designed to be pulled out in a pinch to free oneself from thick vines or tangled lines, but more for building shelter, cutting food, and other tasks performed during a pause. These knives are often larger, heavier, or less durable than knives meant for more general-purpose use due to their more specialized mission. For instance, a thin camp knife such as Benchmade's cutlery options is not suited to hacking through underbrush like a machete, but comes in handy when slicing up vegetables to prepare some Dutch oven stew. The construction of these knives will vary depending on their intended use, so what constitutes a ""camp knife"" is largely up to one's judgement.</p><p>Machetes are long knives designed specifically for hacking through vegetation, whether for trekking through the jungle or clearing one's backyard. Due to this, they often feature front-heavy blades to aid in swinging, very forgiving blade steel to prevent chipping or breaking, and easily-resharpened edges for prolonged field usage. I didn't feature any true machetes in this list, but certain knives like the Esee 6 are large enough to serve as a machete in some cases when it comes to stripping saplings or chopping through vines.</p>",674.0
89,survival radios,"<h2>Types of survival radios</h2><p>Technically, any radio can become a survival radio in a pinch. As long as you have a radio that can pick up AM and FM broadcast signals, you'll be able to tune in to broadcasts. But when you're focused on survival, having an actual survival radio — one that's equipped with the tools and radio wavelengths you need in an emergency — is even more important.</p><p>Survival radios share many of the same features and capabilities. But there are two different types of these radios: AM/FM and weather alert. Each specific type offers its own benefits and disadvantages. Read on to discover which is the best fit for your emergency kit.</p><h3>AM/FM survival radios</h3><p>AM/FM survival radios, which are also often called simply emergency radios, are able to pick up AM and FM radio frequencies. They'll keep you informed on the latest information when you're in a developing situation, allowing you to access both local radio stations and those that are farther away. This kind of emergency radio is typically used when the power goes out — so, these radios don't always have a wealth of extra features.</p><p>Your average AM/FM survival radio features multiple power options, like a hand crank, solar charging, and traditional wall outlet or battery power. This ensures you'll be able to use your radio even when your access to electricity is nonexistent. These radios can also include survival extras, like a built-in flashlight, an emergency alert sound, and extra battery power.</p><h3>Weather alert survival radios</h3><p>A weather alert survival radio is a more specialized kind of emergency device. These radios are able to broadcast alerts from NOAA, giving you critical information about weather in your area. You can even fine-tune your alerts if you choose a weather alert radio that includes Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) capability. Many weather alert models also allow you to tune in to local radio stations for updates and alerts beyond the weather. This versatility can be especially handy in a survival situation.</p><p>Additionally, these radios often include all of the same features of AM/FM survival radios. You'll find options with flashlights, emergency lights or alerts, backup battery power, and more.</p>",357.0
90,thermal scopes,"<h2>Types of thermal scopes</h2><p>On the surface, there are basically thermal optics that are designed for handheld use and thermal scopes that can be mounted to a firearm. Both styles have their place and both include entry-level options all the way up to top-shelf products. Your first step is to determine how you plan to use your fancy new thermal scope. Then, you can get into the technical features.</p><h3>Handheld thermal scopes</h3><p>The simplest way to get a thermal view of the world is with a handheld monocular that isn't designed as a rifle scope. These devices use the same technology to create a heat-based image, but don't need to incorporate a reticle or mounting system. Optics like the Teledyne FLIR Scion OTM have a proven track record of success in the military, law enforcement, and civilian arenas.</p><p>The biggest advantage of owning this kind of thermal optic is the ability to use it without pointing a weapon. That can be key during a search for a missing person, an attempt to identify a subject who has recently fled the scene of a crime, or when you need to track down game animals in the brush. With proper training, it can potentially be used to identify weapons and body armor under clothing. You may be able to determine whether an approaching person is male or female, and even visualize physical exertion in the form of increased body temperature.</p><h3>Standard thermal scopes</h3><p>Thermal imaging presents a massive tactical advantage when mounted to a firearm. Scopes like the Pulsar Thermion 2 XP50 and Trijicon REAP-IR offer impressive capabilities in hunting and tactical environments. Because these systems are digital, you can change your reticle and color scheme on the fly. Some even have a one-shot-zero feature and can save profiles for multiple weapons or ammunition. The amount of customization in a quality thermal scope is astounding.</p><p>Unlike night vision, thermal imaging requires no light to function, resulting in a distinct advantage in dense vegetation, under cloud cover, and during moonless nights. One important thing to remember is that the real world is not a shooting range — target identification may be the biggest challenge you face. Thermal scopes have three effective ranges: detection, recognition, and identification. While you may be able to see a person or animal nearly 2,000 yards away, being able to tell the difference between a hog and a calf or spot a weapon is another story entirely.</p><h3>Clip-on thermal sights</h3><p>If you aren't ready to dedicate a rifle to thermal use, a clip-on sight can be a great solution. These optics aren't much cheaper than a thermal scope, but they can be combined with your existing scope when you need thermal capabilities and removed when you don't. A clip-on thermal sight like the Pulsar Proton FXQ can turn your existing rifle setup into a technological marvel in no time.</p><p>The downside of adding a clip-on thermal sight to your rifle is added complexity. You'll have two optics to control instead of one, and reaching your thermal sight might be a stretch. It will also be heavier than using a dedicated thermal scope. Either approach is viable and both have devoted followers.</p><h3>Vehicle-mounted</h3><p>We'll go out on a limb and guess that you're not shopping for the kind of thermal optics they mount on attack helicopters or C-130J gunships. Still, they exist and — we imagine — have capabilities far beyond what's made public.</p>",562.0
91,trauma shears,"<h2>Types of trauma shears</h2><p>While trauma shears are themselves a specialized type of scissors, these emergency medical tools have their own unique categories worth noting. The indispensable trauma shear can appear in one of two formats: traditional or multi-tool. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, but your tool of choice will depend most heavily on your own specific needs. Either way, though, you can rely on angled blades, guarded tips, and finely-serrated edges to maximize your trauma shear's capabilities.</p><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Despite what the naysayers would have you believe, tradition isn't always a bad thing, and this is especially true with trauma shears. While a non-traditional shear, such as a multi-tool trauma shear, certainly can earn its place in your tool kit, most professional rescuers rely on traditional trauma shears due to their predictability, ease of use, minimal weight, and low cost. For the majority of emergency medical providers, traditional trauma shears are the only way to go.</p><p>For those not already in the know, traditional trauma shears look like funky yet beefy scissors, and the eyes don't lie. Traditional trauma shears break the mold of the traditional scissors form factor, but their odd angles and added girth make safe and speedy emergency care a reality.</p><h3>Multi-tool</h3><p>As you might expect, these trauma shear multi-tools do more than snip through safety belts or slice through denim at the drop of a hat. These multi-tools often pack in features like strap cutters, glass breakers, O2 wrenches, and measurement markings. Best of all, they fold away like a typical knife-oriented multi-tool.</p><p>If space efficiency is your best friend, then a multi-tool trauma shear may be worth your hard-earned cash. Thanks to their increased versatility, they can be an excellent choice for go bags, minimalist emergency kits, or similar uses. Also, compared to most traditional trauma shears, these tools hold an edge MUCH longer, making them a true investment. Of course, the added weight is a tradeoff that may or may not be worth it to you.</p>",326.0
92,treadmills under 1000,"<h2>Types of treadmills under $1,000</h2><h3>Motorized</h3><p>The most common treadmills these days use some type of motor to propel the belt. Typical treadmill motors range from two to four horsepower, but they can be more or less than this depending on the model. In general, you want a treadmill with at least a 2.5-horsepower motor if you're planning to use it for jogging, and at least three horsepower for running. Motorized treadmills tend to be larger than their manual counterparts, for obvious reasons, and therefore will take up more space in your home gym.</p><h3>Manual</h3><p>Manual treadmills are exactly what they sound like; treadmills that make you do most of the work. How unfair, right? It's not like you're trying to break a sweat or something. Most manual treadmills under $1,000 use dual flywheels to provide efficient movement of the belt, once the user gets it started. There are other types of manual treadmills out there (see example), but these machines can run a pretty high price tag, so we won't speak of them here. Manual treadmills are great, in that they do not require any electricity to run, and there are a lot fewer technical parts that the owner needs to worry about maintaining.</p><h3>Foldable</h3><p>Both motorized and manual treadmills can fall into the category of ""foldable,"" which are just treadmills that can be folded up or down to be stored more easily or moved out of the way. The majority of foldable treadmills hinge upward near the motor/flywheels at the front of the machine. The machine then stands upright, using much less space than it would have in its normal configuration. Foldable treadmills are excellent for home gyms with limited space or difficult-to-reach areas like up a flight of stairs or around doorways.</p>",289.0
93,utility knives,"<h2>Types of utility knives</h2><p>Utility knives come in many different forms and sizes. No matter what task you have in mind or what your local restrictions are, it's probable that you'll easily find a utility knife that suits your needs. You can find them at pretty much any hardware or big box store, and they're available at pretty much every price point.</p><h3>EDC/folder</h3><p>Also referred to as a pocket knife, a folder is a compact knife that features one or more blades that fold up into the handle, in lieu of using a bulky sheath. Meant to fit easily inside your pocket, these knives are legal to carry in most places, and are convenient to carry and use daily. They are frequently smaller than fixed blades, with blades typically between three and four inches long, although there are many exceptions that are both longer and shorter than this. However, they're quite handy — they can do everything from peeling an apple to cutting small rope or twine to opening packages. Though these folding knives are typically smaller and not as strong as their fixed blade siblings, they're highly versatile.</p><h3>Fixed blade</h3><p>A fixed blade is any knife with a blade that is ""fixed"" in place, meaning that it doesn't have a pivot, and is firmly, immovably attached to the handle. They're essentially the opposite of pocket knives. The blade is always exposed unless it's covered by a sheath. They're simple, easier to manufacture than folding knives, and very user-friendly due to the absence of a confusing locking mechanism.</p><p>Fixed blade utility knives come in many varieties, including drop-point and wharncliffe-style knives. The better-designed fixed blades are also full-tang, where the part of the blade that's part of the handle is the same size and shape as the handle, as this provides the greatest overall strength. The majority of cheap utility fixed blades, unfortunately, are not; these knives have a thin metal ‘tail' that is typically pinned or glued inside of the handle and are more prone to breaking.</p><h3>Multitool</h3><p>Though technically a sub-category of folding knives, the main selling point of a multitool isn't the blade itself, but rather the multiple tools that accompany it. This can include anything from pliers or scissors to screwdrivers and corkscrews. It can come in the form of a small Swiss Army Knife, or a larger Leatherman multitool. Companies such as Victorinox, Leatherman, and Gerber are well-known for their multitool offerings.</p><h3>Retractable</h3><p>One of the most common utility knives, retractable knives can be found everywhere from warehouses to the office, and chances are, even your house. Retractable utility knives are usually very inexpensive, typically taking the form of box-cutters and snap-blades. The latter features pre-scored lines in the blade, allowing you to snap off dull segments and extend the blade further to utilize the remaining undulled blade.</p>",463.0
94,walkie talkies,"<h2>Types of walkie talkies</h2><p>Walkie talkie can take on a few different meanings, but it's important to know what you're talking about before you buy a set of radios and hit the push-to-talk button for the first time. First and foremost, you need to know that the radios you buy can do what you need them to do. Second, it's a good idea to make sure you won't be incurring the wrath of the feds. Don't worry, we have your back.</p><h3>Citizen's band</h3><p>Citizen's band radios are hugely popular with truckers because of their respectable range (anywhere from three to 20 miles, depending on the radio and environment) and low cost. Both of these advantages come courtesy of CB radio's reliance on AM frequencies. No license is required, but FCC rules and stubborn Texas lawmen still apply.</p><p>These radios are larger than a walkie talkie, so they're best suited to use in a building or vehicle. One of the advantages is the ability to purchase components separately, so you can choose the radio, handset, and antenna that work best for you. If you spend a lot of time on the road, a CB radio can be a solid alternative to a walkie talkie.</p><h3>Family Radio Service (FRS)</h3><p>When most people talk about walkie talkies, they're referring to radios that operate on frequencies reserved for the family radio service. Easy access to radio communication was in jeopardy at one point, and we owe a debt of gratitude to Radio Shack for stepping in and convincing the federal government to protect certain wavelengths for the general public.</p><p>These FRS radios have limited range and strength of signal because their transmitting power cannot exceed two watts, but they're inexpensive and easy to use. They've become increasingly popular over the years with people who enjoy spending time in the outdoors and families who want to stay in touch on the go. We focused on FRS radios for this list, since they don't require any kind of license or training to operate and come ready to rock out of the box.</p><h3>General mobile radio service</h3><p>Like the FRS band, general mobile radio service uses FM radio to communicate. This results in signal quality that's much stronger and clearer than what you'd get from a CB radio. The difference between FRS and GMRS lies in power output. Stepping up to a GMRS radio will get you access to a better signal, increased range, and less chatter from other users.</p><p>The downside of GMRS radios is that they're subject to more government regulation. Users need to be licensed to operate on these frequencies. Licensure isn't expensive, but it's an extra step that isn't necessary for most people and (shocker) it's unnecessarily complicated.</p><h3>Amateur radio</h3><p>Amateur radios sound like the easiest option for new users, but the name is a little misleading. This ""ham"" designation isn't aimed at new users who want to chat while they hunt, hike, or ski; it's for enthusiasts who want to learn the ins and outs of how radios work.</p><p>Tampering with your radios is frowned upon and may get you in hot water with the authorities — unless you have a ham radio license. In fact, licensed radio operators are encouraged to tinker with their equipment and experiment with getting the most out of it. These radios are far more powerful than anything else on this list, and are capable of achieving tremendous range.</p>",559.0
95,wallets,"<h2>Types of wallets</h2><h3>Slim wallet</h3><p>If you've ever dealt with a bulky wallet that won't slide into your pocket, you're familiar with the value of a slim wallet. The minimalist design is meant to help you keep the essentials (and only the essentials) on your person. That means it has fewer card holding pockets and a small opening for cash. Most don't incorporate closures, using the pressure of the design to hold your items firmly in place. The compact structure is geared towards those looking to cut through the noise and only carry the things actually necessary to function.</p><h3>RFID wallet</h3><p>A modern type of wallet, the need for protection against data theft is relatively new. Designed to block radio frequencies from accessing the cards inside the wallet, these are built to resist RFID skimming. It all comes down to the material used in construction. Leather offers a baseline level of protection, though more advanced materials like carbon-fibre and aluminum go one step further. This type of wallet is designed for those who always carry their credit and debit cards and want to prioritize personal security.</p><h3>Bifold wallet</h3><p>Often called a billfold wallet, this type touts a more traditional design. Popularized when paper money became prevalent, the bifold wallet originally had few card compartments (originally used for business cards). Modern designs keep the original structure that opens at the center, though add in extra openings for cards. The textile structure ranges in material from leather to nylon, though many prefer leather for its natural level of RFID protection.</p>",252.0
96,weighted vests,"<h2>Types of weighted vests</h2><h3>Plate carrier</h3><p>Anyone who's deployed overseas in the last 20 years has probably worn a plate carrier, IOTV (Improved Outer Tactical Vest), or—if you're old like me—an IBA. When worn for long periods of time, I remember them becoming hot, uncomfortable, and cumbersome. So, being the suckers for punishment we are, it only seems natural to purchase one for personal recreational use.</p><p>Plate carrier vests are modeled after (and sometimes serve double duty as) military or law enforcement grade body armor. These vests are usually lifted over the head and then synched around the abdomen with Velcro straps or buckles. On the front and back of the vests are two large pockets, meant to hold cast iron or laser-cut weight plates, but can also hold some sizes of standard circular plates in a pinch. Plate carrier vests are usually made with durable Cordura fabric (strong, woven nylon or polyester) and are meant to take a beating.</p><h3>Pouch vests</h3><p>Okay, ""Pouch Vests"" isn't really their name, but it's the best way to describe the standard style vest that doesn't fall into the military-style plate carrier category. Pouch vests, as their made-up name implies, are weighted vests that carry weight in a series of well-placed pouches around the torso. The pouches can be filled with a variety of different weight options, such as small iron bars or bags filled with steel shot, iron shavings, or sand. The size and quantity of the pouches on these vests allows the wearer to make more nuanced adjustments to their workout weight but forces them to pay more attention to how the weight is distributed over the body. These vests tend to be more budget-friendly than plate carriers.</p><h3>Backpack vests</h3><p>Backpack vests are weighted vests that leave the front of the torso open and all of the weight in the shoulders straps and back. These types of vests offer a greater range of motion for the wearer, but they typically don't range as high in weight capacity. Backpack vests seem to be more favorable to users who intend to wear the vest while performing cardio exercises, such as running, walking, rucking, and dance-offs. Backpack vests seem to be the style most recommended for women since the open front eliminates the uncomfortable restraints of a full-front weighted vest.</p><h3>Heavy-weight vests</h3><p>Heavyweight vests are probably the least prevalent type, but they do exist and you should be aware of them in case you want to become a true beast of an individual. This type of vest comes with a weight sleeve (or two) built right into it. The user simply hangs standard, circular weight plates, like those you might use for bench press and squat bars, from the weight racks on the front and back and secures them down with a screw-on stopper. This type of vest is best for individuals training to become Ninja Turtles or those who simply like to horde the 45-pound plates at the gym. Please exercise caution when using these vests and never lift alone. If you fall on your back, you may not be able to right yourself, which could result in starvation or leave your fleshy underbelly vulnerable to predators.</p>",524.0
97,windproof lighter,"<h2>Types of windproof lighters</h2><p>When you're searching for the perfect windproof lighter, you'll want to consider a few different kinds. There are a number of different options available, from traditional fuel-powered flame lighters to more high-tech flameless options powered by electricity. Here's an overview of three of the most common types of windproof lighters you'll find.</p><h3>Fuel-based lighters</h3><p>Fuel-based lighters are traditional — in fact, you're very likely already carrying a fuel-based lighter. But fuel-based windproof lighters are a little different from the average lighter. These lighters typically run on butane, and they emit flames that are supposed to be strong enough to stay lit when wind is blowing. Many fuel-based windproof lighters are also double flame torch lighters, which gives you extra power and double the flame output to withstand wind.</p><p>There are a number of benefits to fuel-based lighters; they're easy to use and they're excellent for lighting campfires and getting grills fired up. They're quite versatile too. However, when they run out of fuel, you're out of firepower. Even with two flames, the wind can still knock out your light source if it's blowing fiercely.</p><h3>Arc or plasma lighters</h3><p>Arc lighters, or plasma lighters, are another windproof option. These lighters don't rely on fuel; instead, they use electricity to generate a ""flame"" that looks nothing like a traditional flame. Arc lighters run on rechargeable batteries, and they use two electrodes at one end to spark fire. With the push of a button, an electrical arc appears between the electrodes, and that arc will light whatever's placed in its path.</p><p>One of the biggest benefits of an arc or plasma lighter is the ease of use. You don't have to refill any fuel, and the battery can be recharged via USB like most modern gadgets. There's no flame to worry about — when you need to start a fire, the electricity and electrodes will get the job done.</p><h3>Coil lighters</h3><p>Coil lighters, which are also called Tesla coil lighters, are another option. They're pretty similar to arc and plasma lighters, as they don't actually create a flame when used as a lighter. Instead, they use Nikola Tesla's high-voltage, low-current electrical coil to spark a fire. The coil generates a high-heat electric arc. So, with no fuel needed, a coil lighter turns energy into a spark that can withstand even the windiest and most gale-like conditions outdoors.</p><p>Like arc and plasma lighters, coil lighters don't require any fuel. They also recharge via USB, and you'll get hundreds of uses out of a single charge.</p>",415.0
98,winter hiking boots,"<h2>Types of winter hiking boots</h2><p>While hiking boots in general have a decent range of sub-niches, winter hiking boots tend to be more specialized than the broader hiker category. Still, winter hiking boots do have some degree of diversity worth exploring. Standard winter hiking boots tend to be warmer (and heavier) than their warm-weather brothers, and those built for hunting and extremely cold temps come with some additional features.</p><h3>Backpacking boots</h3><p>Backpacking may seem like an elite outdoor sport for some (or a sadistic form of self-punishment for others). Whatever the case, a reliable pair of winter backpacking boots is non-negotiable for that special breed of hiker. Predictably, winter backpacking boots are a breed all their own as well.</p><p>Easily the biggest difference between a traditional hiking boot and a backpacking boot is the extra ankle support found in the backpacker's footwear, although upgraded durability and toughness are equally as important. While it may go without saying, winter backpacking boots demand all the same features as traditional backpacking boots but with the obvious need for insulation, waterproofing, and other winter-specific features.</p><h3>Hunting boots</h3><p>Traditionally, hiking and hunting boots have tended to fall into different categories, thanks to somewhat different user demographics. That said, when the rubber meets the gravel, the differences between boots designed for active winter hunts and those created for winter hikes are surprisingly minimal. Both are insulated, provide good ankle support, and are designed for long hours in the backcountry.</p><p>Due to their need to battle lower temps, hunting boots, like winter hikers, tend to pack on the ounces thanks to critical insulation layers, although both designs emphasize lightweight construction. In terms of fit and feel, hunting boots may have slightly more flexible soles to provide better ground feel and a slightly warm insulation due to the generally slower pace of hunting.</p><p>Additionally, hunting boots frequently include scent-proof membranes or other scent-killing features. We all know the lethal consequences of overexposure to sweaty feet and boots, but it turns out even a minor whiff of said odor can kill a mountain hunt faster than you can blink.</p><h3>Extreme cold boots</h3><p>Winter hiking boots designed for the extreme cold may be your best option if you live in Montana, Alaska, or other absurdly cold and rugged locales. These hikers combine critical hiking boots elements with the best snow boots have to offer for an extremely warm, go-anywhere hiker.</p><p>Usually, these boots are optimized a little more for use in the snow, but they still provide plenty of grip for rocks, gravel, and other significant terrain features. These boots boast some top-notch insulation, and many include extra sole thickness to increase underfoot insulation. Of course, all these add-ons will increase the overall weight, but the tradeoff is warmth that'll keep icicles off your toes.</p>",454.0
99,zoom binoculars,"<h2>Types of zoom binoculars</h2><p>Zoom binoculars are valuable assets in the field, but they aren't all created equal and they don't all work the same way. What excels in one type of situation might not work in another. Before you spend your hard-earned money on a pair of variable-power binoculars, let us walk you through your options to help you make an informed decision.</p><h3>Traditional</h3><p>Traditional binoculars have been around for ages, and they're just as useful today as they have ever been. By essentially connecting two tiny telescopes, manufacturers let you see further than you could with the naked eye, but still retain depth perception by using both eyes. Adjustments typically include controls for width, focus, and eye relief. If you see black rings or blurry images through your binoculars, the fix is as simple as twisting a few knobs.</p><p>Most high-end binoculars use a traditional setup. This causes them to be relatively large and heavy, but many people find the optical clarity worthwhile.</p><h3>Compact</h3><p>As good as traditional binoculars are, sometimes you need a smaller, lighter alternative. If you weigh your pack and consider every ounce of gear, saving a little weight here and there matters. If you're out on a hunt and have rifle optics available to you as well, maybe a small pair of binoculars that doesn't get in the way is what you want.</p><p>Compact binoculars use a small unibody construction that not only reduces size and weight, but avoids opportunities to get binocular tubes snagged on your gear or nearby branches. They generally have lower power magnification and smaller-diameter objective lenses as a result.</p><h3>Night vision</h3><p>Just because the sun goes down doesn't mean you have to give up the power of sight. Night vision capability is getting increasingly affordable and we support your endeavor to own the night yourself.</p><p>There's more to seeing at night than big objective lenses; to truly light up the night, you need actual night vision technology. How does that work? Three easy steps: light enters the device, magic happens, and you can see in the dark. Different devices use different types of magic, but you get the idea. Even if you can't get your hands on military-grade optics, you can still purchase infrared technology and zoom capability. Best of all, they're not that noticeable on your face.</p>",379.0
