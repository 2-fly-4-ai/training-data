43,ballistic helmets,,"<h2>FAQs on ballistic helmets</h2><h3>Is a ballistic helmet worth it if you're not military?</h3><p>There are many reasons to own a ballistic helmet if you're not in the military. For instance, many SWAT officers wear one when serving high-risk warrants, and it's common for reporters who are reporting in active war zones to wear one. Helmets are also the most secure platform for mounting night vision, as compared to headbands and skull caps, but a bump helmet is just as secure with less cost. Ultimately, it will be up to the end-user to decide if ballistic protection for their head is worthwhile.</p><h3>Are ballistic helmets legal?</h3><p>The short answer to this is that local laws vary. The long answer is that in certain states, you cannot buy body armor in the mail and have to go to an authorized dealer, and in nearly every state is it illegal to own any kind of body armor if you are a convicted felon. Additionally, in some states, wearing body armor while committing a crime of any sort leads to an enhanced sentence. Know your local laws and proceed with caution.</p><h3>What is the difference between bump and ballistic helmets?</h3><p>A bump helmet only provides protection against blunt force trauma, hence the name ""bump helmet."" Ballistic helmets are made of specially composed materials designed to deflect or stop bullets and fragmentation. It is very important that you make sure that you are wearing the right helmet for the right job, so if you anticipate ballistic threats, don't be caught wearing a bump helmet.</p><h3>Is there a Level 4 ballistic helmet?</h3><p>As of the time of writing, there is no helmet that reliably stops a direct hit from M2 armor-piercing rounds at a distance of 10 feet, which is more or less the standard for NIJ IV. Additionally, rounds of this caliber enter into the realm of muzzle energies that would cause traumatic brain injury, whiplash, and concussion simply from the actual force of the round impacting and being stopped by the helmet, making this a very hard thing to achieve.</p><h3>What is a Level 3 ballistic helmet?</h3><p>A true level III ballistic helmet will stop a 7.62 NATO round at 10 feet. To my knowledge, there is only one helmet that achieves this without using additional armor applique, and that is the Highcom Arditi. Additionally, the National Institute of Justice does not officially certify helmets, so it's mostly on the manufacturer to test that their helmets can do the same thing as the NIJ standard for plates. Reference this link for more information.</p><h3>What is the strongest ballistic helmet?</h3><p>Of the helmets we surveyed, the Ops-Core RF1 and the Highcom Arditi are the current top contenders for raw ballistic protection. Both of them will stop serious rifle threats, and the Ops-Core rated for that hit on every part of the helmet, whether it's on the edge or on the top of the cranium.</p><h3>What ballistic helmets do SEALs use?</h3><p>The short answer to this question is ""whatever the hell they want,"" but the long answer is that Navy SEALs have been spotted wearing Ops-Core helmets most frequently, with specific versions like the Ops-Core FAST maritime being specifically designed for their use. Rest assured that whatever the latest and greatest is, generously funded Special Operations units are probably using it in some capacity.</p><h3>Can civilians buy ballistic helmets?</h3><p>It depends on the specific model and where the individual in question lives. Certain retailers and certain manufacturers will not sell certain items without proof of military or law enforcement affiliation. This is mostly done for liability reasons and a desire to clamp down on people trying to sell high-tech helmets to Russia and China to be reverse-engineered.</p><h3>Are ballistic helmets controlled for export?</h3><p>Ballistic helmets, personal protective equipment, and military gear, in general, are governed under the International Trade in Arms Regulation, or ITAR. It is a severe offense to sell, give, or trade these items outside of the borders of the United States without specific licensure from the American government. Violating this regulation can lead to severe penalties such as fines, prison time, and asset confiscation. There is a significant black market for American tactical gear, especially in countries where MilSim Airsoft is popular, such as Europe and Asia. DO NOT buy personal protective equipment to be resold to a foreigner, or risk severe penalties, no matter how many multiples of the MSRP they offer to pay you. When in doubt, ask the manufacturer if the item in question is controlled under this regulation.<br/>",742
173,first aid kits,,"<h2>FAQs on first aid kids</h2><h3>Why do I need a first aid kit.</h3><p>People do stupid things; ergo, you need a first aid kit. Oh yeah, and accidents can happen at the most random times. Like the time I sliced myself with my Buck Cadet. While opening a package. For a plastic pie server. (How did I get this job again?)</p><h3>What should I look for in a first aid kit</h3><p>A first aid kit's contents will vary widely from kit to kit, but the chances are if you don't know what something is or how/when to use it, then you probably shouldn't get it.</p><h3>Where should I keep a first aid kit?</h3><p>Wherever you think you'll need one. In your glove box, under your sink … just keep it easily accessible. Personally, I carry one with me everywhere I go, but then again, I'm weird like that.</p><h3>Do first aid kits expire?</h3><p>No, but some components may need to be replaced from time to time. Most over-the-counter medications never expire; however, they will slowly lose potency over the years. Bandages and dressings require dry, sealed packages to maintain their sterile integrity. Gel packets, alcohol wipes, and similar supplies will eventually dry out over time and need to be replaced every so often.</p><h3>Are there any first aid kit regulations I should be aware of?</h3><p>To my knowledge, there are no regulations on first aid kits. That said, there are plenty of laws and other restrictions surrounding the administration of first aid. The most significant are Good Samaritan laws and laws restricting who can administer medications in an emergency.</p><h3>What should a first aid kit include for patching?</h3><p>This will vary from kit to kit depending on a given first aid kit's intended purpose. As of late 2021, common OSHA-compliant kits must include (at minimum): a box of adhesive bandages, multiple gauze pads (at least 4 by 4-inches), two large gauze pads (at least 8 x 10 inches), and one roller gauze bandage (at least 2 inches wide).</p><h3>Can I take a first aid kit on a plane?</h3><p>Absolutely. Unless you plan to pack along an emergency knife, carrying a first aid kit onto a plane shouldn't cause any issues. The only potential issue you might run into is if you include trauma shears in your kit (a rare add-on). I've only taken trauma shears through TSA a handful of times, but I haven't had any issues. Your mileage may vary.</p><h3>How much does a first aid kit weight?</h3><p>In general, first aid kits tend to weigh in somewhere between one and three pounds. That said, each kit is different, and I've seen kits above and below those numbers.</p><h3>Do I need to consult a physician or medical professional to approve first aid supplies at my business?</h3><p>Workplace first aid supplies are dictated by OSHA standards, and all OSHA-mandated first aid equipment can be purchased without restriction at Amazon, CVS, Walmart, etc. Of course, none of your supplies are any good if no one knows how to use them. Get yourself and your staff first aid certified.</p><h3>Should first aid kits be regularly inspected to ensure contents are complete and up to date</h3><p>Absolutely. During my time as a lifeguard and assistant pool manager, my staff and I regularly checked the status of our first aid kits.</p><h3>Can over-the-counter medicines be put in first aid kits?</h3><p>Yes, although which over-the-counter medications a first aid kit includes will depend somewhat on its intended use case(s). First aid kits frequently include acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin), a topical antiseptic, and a topical antibiotic. They may also include sugar/glucose tablets, burn cream, or sting relief wipes.</p>",591
211,trail running shoes,,"<h2>FAQs on trail running shoes</h2><h3>Do you need different shoes for trail running?</h3><p>As with most workout gear, the answer is ""it depends."" If you plan on long distances (over 10 miles), you probably want to look at the trail runners with more cushion and deep lugs (assuming the trails are technical).</p><h3>What makes trail running shoes different from other running shoes?</h3><p>The typical trail runner has thicker cushioning and more rigidity throughout than a regular road shoe. More importantly, it has a tough outsole with lugs on the bottom to provide stability on the varied surfaces you'll find on trails. To help deal with wet and muddy conditions, some trail runners are waterproof, while others use breathable meshes and various types of drainage to help the shoe dry quickly and to help avoid blisters.</p><h3>Is it OK to use trail running shoes on the road?</h3><p>Usually, yes. However, I don't like to. The lugs on trail runners are designed to help navigate rocks and roots and to sink into softer trails. Deep lugs feel weird when running on paved surfaces, and wear out faster than they're supposed to. Having said that, there are crossover/hybrid shoes with shorter lugs and more flexibility for multi-surface running.</p><h3>What trail running shoes should I use to run in mud?</h3><p>Shoes with large (5-6mm) lugs and aggressive lug patterns provide ideal stability and confidence while running on muddy surfaces. Waterproof shoes are probably best, although they don't breathe as well, but most shoes are designed to at least drain water as you run.</p><h3>What's the most cushioned trail running shoe?</h3><p>Shoes made for ultra or marathon running tend to pack in the most cushioning. Hoka One One went all in on this maximum cushioning, and the Speedgoat 4 is one of the most cushioned you'll find.</p><h3>Should I wear gaiters with trail running shoes?</h3><p>This depends on the kind of trails you're running and the distance. Gaiters help to keep debris and moisture from getting into your shoes, so if you're running long distances on muddy, snowy, or sandy trails, they may be helpful. But if you're running relatively short distances, like three to five miles, they may be more trouble than they're worth.</p><h3>Why are trail running shoes so expensive?</h3><p>Regular running shoes are expensive enough as it is, right? Then why are trail runners even more so? It has to do with the increased durability needed in the shoe's upper, midsole, cushioning, and outsole. The materials that make up the shoes have to be sturdy enough to provide support and absorb impact while also being breathable and somewhat flexible. They also need to be able to last despite being literally run into the ground, so then you can understand how the price of these shoes climbs pretty fast.</p><h3>Can I wear trail running shoes for hiking?</h3><p>Absolutely. In fact, many serious hikers do. Check out this article from 2019, Top Footwear of the Appalachian Trail. Over 75 percent of the 365 Appalachian trail hikers that participated in the article survey that year wore trail runners at least part of the time. Be sure to break them in the same way as new boots, though, or you'll wind up with blisters and hot spots. Also, if you have ankle stability issues, you may want to stick with traditional hiking boots.</p><h3>Can I wear trail shoes for walking?</h3><p>Yes, but the hybrid/crossover trail runners, like the Brooks Caldera 5 and Divide 2, will probably perform the best on paved surfaces.</p>",568

18,survival knives,,"<h2>FAQs about survival knives</h2><h3>What is the best survival knife?</h3><p>Our pick for the best overall survival knife is the Gerber LMF II, which is not to say that it's the absolute best at anything, just that it's a knife that will work well for most people's purposes. Personally, I like the TOPS Brakimo, but that's what works for my intended purposes.</p><h3>Is it legal to carry a survival knife?</h3><p>That depends on your locality. Certain states prohibit the concealed carry of fixed blade knives, or knives over certain lengths. In general, these are knives intended for use in the wilderness, and most places in the world have exceptions in their knife laws for ""good reason,"" which is usually satisfied by being on a hiking or camping trip. As always, know your local laws.</p><h3>What are the holes on a survival knife for?</h3><p>Holes on a survival knife can serve many purposes, ranging from being lightening cuts, as with the Argali Carbon, to lashing holes on the Gerber LMF II that allow you to make an improvised spear, to lanyard loops to allow one to retain the knife easier in highly mobile situations like rock climbing or on a boat. Other uses can be for using a hand drill to make fire, straightening arrowheads, or opening gas keys on an oxygen tank.</p><h3>How thick should a survival knife be?</h3><p>Generally speaking, knives that are 4mm in thickness or greater at the spine are going to be able to stand up to the kind of high-impact use that's required to strip branches, baton logs, and chop wood. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and the thickness can also be dependent on factors such as blade length, intended use, and blade steel. Making the blade too thick can add unnecessary weight or make the knife minimally useful for cleaning animals or cutting vegetables.</p><h3>What is jimping?</h3><p>Jimping is the name for serrations on the spine of the knife, which allow you to get greater control of the knife when performing delicate tasks such as whittling or cleaning an animal. They allow you to get a grip on the spine of the blade with your thumb.</p><h3>What is the best type of steel for a knife's blade?</h3><p>This depends on your intended usage, your sharpening capabilities, and your budget. I personally prefer CPM S35VN, as it holds an edge for a very long time and keeps rust off very well. However, it's difficult to resharpen and requires that I send it off to a professional for resharpening. Many survival knife companies seem to prefer 1095, 420HC, and D2, as they're easy enough to resharpen and offer good edge retention, at the expense of corrosion resistance. Buyers looking for knives to use around water, especially saltwater, should look for knives specifically designed to hold up against heavy corrosion.</p><h3>How can I sharpen my knife?</h3><p>We did a great article on this, but in general you should invest in a good-quality guided sharpener for home usage, and a good-quality portable sharpening stone for use in the field, and learn how to use both properly. This will enhance the service life of your knife and save you money in the long run that would be otherwise spent on sending your knife to a professional for sharpening.</p>",539
182,gas masks,,"<h2>FAQs about gas masks</h2><h3>What gas mask do the Navy SEALs use?</h3><p>Most U.S. forces, including the Navy SEALs, generally use the Avon M50, but some have been spotted using the Ops-Core SOTR for certain cases.</p><h3>Is it legal to own a gas mask?</h3><p>In many states, there are laws that prohibit the wearing of masks with the intent to conceal one's identity. While gas masks do cover one's face, it's difficult to prove that someone wore a gas mask specifically to conceal their identity. A police officer may attempt to arrest you and charge you under these laws, but they often require intent to conceal, as in the case with Virginia. Know your local laws, and consult with an attorney.</p><h3>Who invented gas masks?</h3><p>Garrett Morgan, a Black scientist and inventor who was the son of a Confederate general and an enslaved woman, patented the first practical gas mask in 1914. These aided rescue workers and soldiers almost immediately, especially with the onset of World War I. He invented it due to observing how rescue workers were not able to enter the Triangle Shirtwaist company as it burned down in 1911, due to the noxious fumes, which killed 77 percent of the people who died that day. His invention was the first respirator meant to draw fresh air from below the smoke and carbon monoxide using a hose that dragged on the ground, and filter it through a wet sponge to remove smoke particles. His invention was then further developed by John Scott Haldane and others during World War I to defeat poison gas used by the Germans, who added things like chemical filters to neutralize low levels of chlorine and mustard gas.</p><h3>Were gas masks used in World War II?</h3><p>Yes, gas masks were used during World War II, but not as commonly as in World War I. Open gas attacks were relatively rare, mostly performed by the Imperial Japanese against Chinese citizens and troops. The rarity of gas attacks on the Western Front was largely due to the Nazis' blitzkrieg strategy requiring them to move too fast to wait for gas clouds to clear. Additionally, Hitler knew that his opponent, Winston Churchill, had stated openly that if the Nazis used gas, the British would respond in kind, stating ""In the event of the Germans using gas on the Russians…We shall retaliate by drenching the German cities with gas on the largest possible scale."" Churchill also felt that the allies should be less squeamish in using chemical and biological weapons, which was a very controversial thing to say, and which divided his own advisors. Finally, the German logistics system was dependent upon horse-drawn carriages, and they had not developed gas masks for horses that would allow the animals to breathe enough to draw a carriage, and the German scientific development was not advanced enough to provide gasses that would defeat common allied gas masks.</p>",478
64,dry fire training systems,,"<h2>FAQs about dry fire training systems</h2><h3>Is it difficult to learn how to use laser dry fire training systems?</h3><p>There can be a learning curve with some systems, namely setting up the software or zeroing the laser on laser dry fire training systems like the Mantis Blackbeard, but most of these systems include clear and concise information on how to set it up.</p><h3>What about recoil and loading a magazine?</h3><p>Using a system with force feedback like the CoolFire helps simulate recoil, and systems like the Blackbeard have their power stored in a magazine-shaped battery. The CoolFire doesn't impede magazine loading, so you can still practice magazine changes that way. For ultimate function, a system like a SIRT laser training pistol is best.</p><h3>Where should I place the target?</h3><p>Depending on your drill, place a target at a realistic engagement distance. The FBI minimum is 21 feet, but factors like being indoors vs outdoors, size of the target, and the system you're using can affect that.</p><h3>How does laser dry fire training systems help with concealed carry licensing?</h3><p>Certain states have training requirements to qualify for a concealed carry license or permit, and while these tests are not overly onerous in terms of the requirements for accuracy, novice shooters may find a dry fire system helpful to familiarize themselves with their weapon before they go to qualify for their license. In addition, training both dry and live fire is essential to maintain an adequate level of proficiency to reliably ensure that you could defend yourself from an attacker.</p><h3>What kind of lasers do laser dry fire training systems use?</h3><p>Dry fire training systems almost exclusively use Class A lasers, either red, green, or infrared. This is for safety purposes, given that Class A lasers pose minimal risk to the human eye, and they don't consume much battery power or produce much heat. The different colors are personal preference mostly, but infrared lasers can help shooters not rely on the flash of a laser impact to aim their weapon while still allowing the camera on their phone to pick up the light for scoring purposes on an app like Mantis Laser Academy.</p><h3>How many shots can be fired using the laser dry fire training system?</h3><p>It depends on the system. Most are only limited by battery life and your trigger finger cramping, but systems like the CoolFire have a limited store of compressed CO2 and need to be replenished in between strings of fire.</p><h3>Can I use my laser dry fire training system to train for multiple firearms?</h3><p>It depends on the system. For things like the Mantis X3, it can fit on any firearm with a Picatinny rail, and the software can be programmed for multiple configurations. For the CoolFire, it needs to be purchased for the exact handgun that you plan on shooting with.</p>",461
162,swimming goggles,,"<h2>FAQs on swimming goggles</h2><h3>How do you keep swimming goggles from fogging?</h3><p>Swimming goggles, safety glasses, and any other form of eye protection that doesn't allow for airflow will be susceptible to fog. Some goggles will feature a proprietary anti-fog coating, but I have never found these to be very effective. Instead, using a good anti-fog compound such as Cat Crap has worked for me in the past.</p><h3>How do you clean swimming goggles?</h3><p>After every use, you should rinse your goggles in fresh water, which will prevent the chlorine from degrading the coating on your goggles, making the rubber brittle, and leaving residue on your goggle. Doing this will prolong the lifespan of your goggles.</p><h3>Can I wear swimming goggles after LASIK?</h3><p>Once fully healed from LASIK, there should be no issue with swimming with goggles. However, consult your optometrist with this question, as we don't have any doctors on staff that I know of.</p><h3>How do you remove scratches from swim goggles?</h3><p>Depending on the severity of the scratches, and whether or not you have a mirrored coating on your goggles, you may be able to use a compound like Polywatch to buff out some scratches. However, this may not make the goggles as clear as they were before.</p><h3>How do you adjust swimming goggles?</h3><p>Your goggles should be snug, but not overly tight, and should stay on even when diving into the water, pushing off of the wall of the pool, or in heavy surf when in open water. For competitive swimmers, wearing your goggles underneath a swim cap may help with maintaining fit, and other swimmers may find it helpful to change out the nosepiece of their goggles.</p><h3>Can I wear contacts with swimming goggles?</h3><p>You can, however, many swimmers who require corrective lenses instead prefer to wear prescription swim goggles to avoid the possibility of chlorine infiltration under their contacts, which could cause far worse irritation than against the naked eye.</p><h3>How do you assemble swimming goggles?</h3><p>This mostly applies to Swedish swimming goggles, since most swimming goggles require little to no set up. Swedish goggles need to be adjusted for your eye width by lengthening or shortening the string that connects the goggles over the bridge of your nose, and then the rubber straps need to be adjusted. To properly size the straps, whether you use rubber straps or bungees, you'll run the straps through the goggles once on each side, giving you an open end and a closed end. Tie off the open end or use a bungee gather, if using bungees, and adjust the tightness until the goggles feel secure on your head. Try the fit of the goggles underwater, and continue to adjust the length of the nose string and rubber straps until you achieve a secure fit, even in the most vigorous water conditions.</p>",460
102,mens watches,,"<h2>FAQs about men's watches</h2><h3>What is the hottest watch right now?</h3><p>Watches like the Richard Mille RM-01, Patek Philippe Nautilus, and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, often jewel-encrusted, are seen on the wrists of musicians and other celebrities, due to the fact that they are extremely expensive and extremely rare, often as a status symbol. These watches are oftentimes not owned by the person wearing them but are loaned to them by the company as part of a marketing deal to encourage people to aspire to own a $200,000 watch some day.</p><h3>What is the most popular watch?</h3><p>The Rolex Submariner is arguably the most recognizable watch, to the point that people who don't know anything about watches can recognize it as ""a rollie."" This is due to the watch's connection with famous movie characters, excellent marketing deals done with sports, movies, and musicians to get the brand more exposure, and artificial scarcity, where Rolex actively controls who can and can't buy their watches.<br/></p><h3>What is a luxury watch?</h3><p>A luxury watch is a watch that is, by definition, difficult to obtain. Whether due to cost, availability, or both, luxury watches are exclusive and are more pieces of art than they are time-telling devices. These watches are owned as heirlooms, mementos, or status symbols, and are often only sold through specific dealers. Examples of luxury brands are Rolex, Omega, Audemars Piguet, Vacheron Contstantin, Breguet, Jaeger-LeCoultre, and A. Lange & Sohne.</p><h3>How do you know if a watch is good quality?</h3><p>First, evaluate the watch based on materials. In general, things like steel cases, sapphire crystals, and solid link bracelets are good things. Then, research the brand and make sure it has a reputation for quality. Third, avoid heavily advertised ""fashion watches"" like MVMT, Vincero, Valuchi, and so forth. These companies simply rebrand Chinese watches for a 10-times markup. Finally, look at what else might affect the price. Is it a limited edition? Is it rare? Was it featured in a movie? Is it no longer produced? In general, if a watch is vastly cheaper than a more popular option, it's not because you're getting some sweet secret deal, it's because the watch is actually made of lower-quality materials.</p><h3>What does a watch say about a man?</h3><p>I'll answer this one with an anecdote. A former boss of mine once said that whenever a young man came in for an interview wearing a large, ostentatious watch, he would ask him the time. If the man went for his cell phone, it showed that the watch was just there for show and/or it wasn't actually set, and let my boss identify people who were pretentious or ostentatious. Whether that's a good judge of character or not, I'll leave it up to you.<br/></p>",449
161,camping gear,,"<h2>FAQs on camping gear</h2><p>[Length: up to 50 words per FAQ.]</p><h3>Should I buy a two- or three-person tent for my partner and me?</h3><p>It depends on whether that extra room is worth carrying extra weight. Typically, I recommend going with a larger two-person tent.</p><h3>Aren't mummy bags tight and uncomfortable to sleep in?</h3><p>They can be if you get one that's too tight a fit. It's important to test the sleeping bag you purchase before you take it to the field.</p><h3>Do I need to filter/treat the water? I hear it's safe to drink out of the river/lake.</h3><p>Yes. I recommend filtering or treating all water that doesn't come from a potable tap. In some countries, I recommend filtering or treating the tap water as well.</p><h3>Should I get the MSR Whisperlite or Dragonfly stove?</h3><p>Neither. I recommend the JetBoil family of stoves.</p><h3>Can I just buy a smaller backpack and strap more to the outside if I need to?</h3><p>You can, but everything strapped to the outside of your pack is more likely to detach and get lost. If you are climbing in vertical terrain, you'll want to keep your gear in your pack to avoid dropping it on other people and to keep the weight closer to your center of gravity.</p><h3>Should I take packaged or real food?</h3><p>I prefer taking as much real food into the backcountry as possible, but watch the weight because it adds up fast. I typically carry real food for the first few days and then shift to dehydrated meals as the trip goes on.</p><h3>Is it worth the weight to take hiking poles?</h3><p>Hell yes. Trekking poles are worth their weight in gold when traveling over uneven terrain as they provide additional balance and keep you from busting your ass while wearing a heavy pack. They can also help prevent you from injury, serve as poles for setting up a tarp, or even as splints for immobilizing injured arms and legs.</p><h3>Should I buy pots for cooking over an open fire or cooking on a stove?</h3><p>More pots equals more weight carried. If you're car camping, sure. Go ahead. When backpacking, I prefer integrated stove-pot combos like the JetBoil.</p><h3>Pillow or no pillow?</h3><p>Always. An inflatable pillow weighs next to nothing and provides additional comfort to help you get a better night's sleep.</p><h3>Should I pack a warm jacket?</h3><p>Yes. You should always pack an insulating layer - preferably one made from synthetic materials that will continue to insulate when damp. You should carry it every time you venture into the backcountry no matter the season. You should carry it in case you need it, or in case you come across an injured person who is at risk of a cold injury. Always take a warming layer.</p>",445
200,weight benches,,"<h2>FAQs on weight benches</h2><h3>How do I adjust the weight bench?</h3><p>Each bench will be operated differently. Many use spring-loaded pins to secure the bench and seat into position, while some use a notch and bar for convenience. Make sure to read the owner's manual to learn how your bench operates.</p><h3>What muscles/exercises can I work on using a weight bench?</h3><p>You can work your full body with any weight bench. I strongly encourage finding credible sources or coaches to help you learn how to use a bench to the maximum.</p><h3>Does the bench's weight capacity include my body weight?</h3><p>Yes! It is important to remember this when picking a bench. If your bench has a maximum capacity of 600 pounds and you weigh 200 pounds, the maximum weight you could safely lift would be 400 pounds. Lifting more than the weight capacity could have dire consequences.</p><h3>Can I do bench presses on the weight bench?</h3><p>Yes, this is one of the primary purposes of a weight bench. Note of warning: ensure you have a proper racking system if you plan to use a barbell. Otherwise, you should stick to bands or dumbbells.</p><h3>Can I do decline bench press on the weight bench?</h3><p>Yes, if your bench has a decline setting.</p><h3>Should I buy a flat bench or an adjustable one?</h3><p>This comes down to personal preference. Flat benches are great options, but adjustable benches give you more variety of exercises you can do.</p><h3>What is a foldable weight bench?</h3><p>This is a bench that can fold up for convenient storage.</p><h3>How padded should my bench be?</h3><p>Your bench should have enough padding that you don't feel the metal frame pressing into you. Avoid overly plush or soft benches as they won't offer you a stable platform for lifting.</p><h3>Why use a weight bench?</h3><p>Bodyweight workouts can only get you so far.

260,weight benches,,"<h2>FAQs on weight benches</h2><h3>How do I adjust the weight bench?</h3><p>Each bench will be operated differently. Many use spring-loaded pins to secure the bench and seat into position, while some use a notch and bar for convenience. Make sure to read the owner's manual to learn how your bench operates.</p><h3>What muscles/exercises can I work on using a weight bench?</h3><p>You can work your full body with any weight bench. I strongly encourage finding credible sources or coaches to help you learn how to use a bench to the maximum.</p><h3>Does the bench's weight capacity include my body weight?</h3><p>Yes! It is important to remember this when picking a bench. If your bench has a maximum capacity of 600 pounds and you weigh 200 pounds, the maximum weight you could safely lift would be 400 pounds. Lifting more than the weight capacity could have dire consequences.</p><h3>Can I do bench presses on the weight bench?</h3><p>Yes, this is one of the primary purposes of a weight bench. Note of warning: ensure you have a proper racking system if you plan to use a barbell. Otherwise, you should stick to bands or dumbbells.</p><h3>Can I do decline bench press on the weight bench?</h3><p>Yes, if your bench has a decline setting.</p><h3>Should I buy a flat bench or an adjustable one?</h3><p>This comes down to personal preference. Flat benches are great options, but adjustable benches give you more variety of exercises you can do.</p><h3>What is a foldable weight bench?</h3><p>This is a bench that can fold up for convenient storage.</p><h3>How padded should my bench be?</h3><p>Your bench should have enough padding that you don't feel the metal frame pressing into you. Avoid overly plush or soft benches as they won't offer you a stable platform for lifting.</p><h3>Why use a weight bench?</h3><p>Bodyweight workouts can only get you so far. Eventually, you'll need equipment or weights to achieve results. Using a weight bench allows you to increase your volume, intensity, and variations for your workouts.</p><h3>How much should I bench for my weight?</h3><p>How much someone benches will vary drastically depending on the person's body style, metabolism, gender, and even fitness goals.

188,backpacking meals,,"<h2>FAQs about backpacking meals</h2><h3>Why are backpacking meals important?</h3><p>As you journey into the wilderness, whether it's a casual nature walk or a grueling excursion, you need sustenance to fuel yourself; carbs for energy and protein for muscles, etc. Backpacking and hiking meals will provide all of that in a delectable package to ensure you don't get sluggish from hunger out on the trail.</p><h3>How much do backpacking and hiking meals cost?</h3><p>Most meals cost between $10 and $15, with our Best Value winner at $8 to $9 per pouch. Large variety packs are available, mostly running between $120 and $150 per bucket (usually 12 pouches). Military MREs ring in at $40 to $50 for a four-pack and are really for those desperately hunting for that chili mac and cheese spread.</p><h3>How are backpacking and hiking meals prepared?</h3><p>Prepackaged camping food is as mind-numbingly easy to prepare as can be. Do you have hot water? Perfect, you're done. Pour the recommended amount into the pouch, let it stew in its own flavors for the recommended time, and ta-da. MREs include heaters activated by water to warm food while also including beverage mixes, snacks, and toiletries.</p><h3>Are there breakfast items available for morning adventures?</h3><p>You bet your sweet bippy there are. While less common, there are plenty of breakfast items for morning treks, with some companies offering more or less variety. Oatmeal and granola are the most common dishes sold in stores, but breakfast skillets with eggs, veggies, and meats are also available.</p><h3>What are the differences between freeze-dried and dehydrated camping foods?</h3><p>Dehydrating is a simple and ancient method of heating and drying food over some time to evaporate moisture, typically 80 percent or so. It's a cost-effective method that most folks can try through various methods. Freeze-drying is more complex, as food is flash-frozen at low pressure before gradually raising temperatures. This evaporates up to 95 percent of moisture without harsh heat, which may degrade nutritional content.</p><h3>Are backpacking meals healthy?</h3><p>In the sense that they provide hikers with sustenance, fats, and protein to fuel their expeditions, yes, they are quite nutritious and effective and deliver needed energy. But given many products' high-calorie counts and fat content, they can be over-consumed, especially when taken frequently with minimal physical activity. Save your freeze-dried gratin potatoes for when it's time not to be a couch potato.</p>",383
138,snow boots for women,,"<h2>FAQs on snow boots for women</h2><h3>Why do you need snow boots?</h3><p>Unless you are looking to be one of the 1,000,000 people who are injured each year due to falls on snow and ice, yes, you need snow boots if it regularly gets below freezing in your neck of the woods. Even if your area doesn't receive a lot of annual snowfall, It's definitely comforting to know that you can simply pull your trusty snow boots out of the closet to dig out your driveway in comfort after Snowmageddon hits.</p><h3>Can I use my hiking boots as snow boots?</h3><p>Because of their sticky treads and ankle support, hiking boots can be a great alternative to a full snow boot as long as they are insulated and waterproof. Since hiking boots generally only extend over the ankle and tend to have a wider opening at the top, I'd recommend buying leg gaiters to attach to your hiking boots to help keep the snow out. Leg gaiters can add up to 10 inches of waterproof material to your shins and calves and can cost as little as $15.</p><h3>Are snow boots good for hiking?</h3><p>Generally speaking, snow boots are not great for hiking long distances, although you can probably get away with wearing them to comfortably walk your dog around the block. But be aware that waterproofing and insulation can cause the feet to sweat, which means wearing them for extended periods without good socks can actually make your feet feel colder, regardless of the boot's temperature rating.</p><h3>How should snow boots fit?</h3><p>Snow boots are designed to fit snugly around the calf and shin to keep moisture out. While having a zipper for easy on/off access may appeal to you, note that a zipper makes it harder to keep moisture out. Choose a boot with an easy-to-use lacing system to ensure your boots are comfortable and also secure. Finally, ensure you choose snow boots that have enough room in the toe box (generally a thumb's length to the end of the boot) to allow your toes to wiggle and expand. This will promote heat circulation inside of your boots to keep your toes warm. Most experts recommend going a size up from your regular shoe size to ensure you have room to wear a good pair of wool socks.</p>",381
141,hiking boots,,"<h2>FAQs on hiking boots</h2><h3> Should hiking boots be a size bigger than your usual shoe?</h3><p>Sizing is personal. Generally speaking, order hiking boots the same way you order running shoes or work boots, keeping an eye out for brands that run large, small, narrow, or wide. The only caveat I'd offer is that people who hike in thick wool socks might need to account for the extra material by going one half-size up. There are plenty of modern hiking socks that can keep you warm and dry without being bulky, so this is a matter of personal taste.</p><h3> Do hiking boots stretch?</h3><p>Leather boots will break in to become more supple and adjust to the shape of your foot. I wouldn't go so far as to say they stretch, though. Most hiking boots use a combination of synthetic materials, though, so you can expect your hiking boots to fit basically the same throughout their service life.</p><h3> Can I wear hiking boots for regular walking?</h3><p>Absolutely. Being over-geared is a lot less problematic than being under-geared. Because of their price, I wouldn't recommend buying hiking boots specifically for walking, but there's no reason you couldn't lace up your hiking boots for a walk every now and then between camping trips. In fact, that's a great way to break them in.</p><h3> Do I need to spend a lot of money on hiking boots?</h3><p>Not necessarily. Most of us can have a blast with an entry-level or midrange pair of hiking boots. Plenty of up-and-coming manufacturers and established brands offer affordable hiking boots that pack a ton of value. That being said, if you're planning on climbing a 14er or hiking one of the National Scenic Trails you need to invest in something that's up to the challenge.</p><h3> How long should hiking boots last?</h3><p>Hiking boot life is probably best measured in miles, not years. Even then, there can be a huge amount of variation depending on the type of terrain you cover, the amount of weight you carry, and the amount of moisture your boots are exposed to. If you start with a quality item and take care of your boots, you can expect to get several hiking seasons out of them. At that point, rotate them into duty for yard work to stretch your dollar even further.</p>",381

120,recumbent exercise bikes,,"<h2>FAQs on recumbent exercise bikes</h2><h3>Who should use a recumbent bike?</h3><p>In fairness, anyone can use a recumbent exercise bike, from rookies to professionals. If you had to boil it down to a specific group, however, they're especially favored by the physically impaired in need of a machine that minimizes fatigue and risk of injury. Elderly, physical therapy patients and overweight individuals are prime examples of those who would benefit due to the design's inherent lack of stress on joints and bones.</p><h3>How long should you work out on a recumbent bike?</h3><p>Depending on your style of routine, the recommended duration may vary. Typically, high-intensity workouts favoring rapid calorie burning can be accomplished within 15 to 30 minutes. Those attempting to maintain a steady pace at a steady heart rate can press on for an hour or more depending on your own limits.</p><h3>Can you lose weight using a recumbent bike?</h3><p>Like any form of cardio, you can very much lose weight on a recumbent. It's all a matter of diet and workout intensity. Typically, higher intensity bursts of cardio may result in greater weight loss in a shorter time than longer, less strenuous routines.</p><h3>Should you stretch before riding a recumbent bike?</h3><p>As with any workout, you should always stretch no matter what. Even with the lessened strain of a recumbent, you're still engaging in some form of resistance training and could risk pulling something, especially if you decide to ramp up resistance levels. Do yourself a favor and stretch before and after your workout.</p><h3>Is a recumbent bike good cardio exercise?</h3><p>Yes, it can be effective just like any other form of cardio. It just depends on your exact use case and what your routine is. As professionals will preach, the same methodology applies: Higher intensity, short bursts will result in more calories burned quicker. Steady, continuous pedaling at a reasonable resistance may promote lower body muscle development and cardiovascular endurance.</p><h3>What is the difference between upright and recumbent exercise bikes?</h3><p>A recumbent exercise bike sports a laid-back, relaxed seating position that eases the spine and tailbone as you're not on a saddle hunching over handlebars. You're sitting in a more conventional chair-like position with legs outstretched, reducing strain on your joints, making recumbents ideal for physically-impaired athletes or those simply wanting to reduce the chance of injury.</p>",378
83,shooting mats,,"<h2>FAQs about shooting mats</h2><h3>What are shooting mats used for?</h3><p>Shooting mats allow hunters, recreational shooters, and military personnel to set up a shooting position in austere conditions where the ground may be wet, muddy, sandy, or covered in other undesirable material (e.g., coyote dung in the high deserts of Arizona).</p><h3>Why do you need to preload your bipod?</h3><p>Preloading a bipod is when the shooter ""leans in"" to the rifle, pressing forward with their entire body against the bipod to minimize the effect of the recoil impulse and the tendency for the rifle to jump off target after a shot. Done correctly, this allows the shooter to retain the sight picture during and after the shot, and substantially reduces the time required for a follow-up shot if necessary. Some shooting mats include ridges or straps to secure the feet of the bipod so that they don't slip when the bipod is preloaded. This feature is a ""nice-to-have"" rather than a ""must-have"" as the bipod can be preloaded effectively by using rubberized or spiked bipod feet or placing a small weight (e.g., sandbag) in front of the bipod.</p><h3>In what environment will you mainly be using the shooting mat?</h3><p>Generally speaking, shooting mats are used either on hard surfaces at established shooting facilities (concrete pads, gravel, etc) or in the backcountry on bare ground, which may also be wet, muddy, or sandy. The shooting mat keeps the shooter and their gear dry, clean, and reasonably comfortable.</p><h3>Can I stake down the shooting mat?</h3><p>Yes, many shooting mats have either grommets or stake loops in the corners to secure the mat during windy conditions.</p><h3>Can I use a shooting mat in wet environments?</h3><p>Absolutely! In wet environments, a quality mat makes the shooting experience more comfortable and improves the ability of the shooter to focus on the fundamentals: sight picture, breathing control, and the surprise trigger break.</p><h3>What else can I use a shooting mat for?</h3><p>Shooting mats are handy for a multitude of uses. I keep one in my truck for when I have to repair or maintain my truck. A shooting mat can also double as a ground cloth for camping or even as a small picnic blanket for lunch by the stream. Padded shooting mats can even replace closed-cell foam or inflatable sleeping mattresses when camping.</p>",376
82,hiking pants for women,,"<h2>FAQs on hiking pants for women</h2><h3>What's the best fabric for hiking pants for women?</h3><p>Freedom of movement is essential, which means you should look for hiking pants with a high nylon and elastic content. The beauty is that these materials are not only stretchy, but they are also breathable, moisture-wicking, and can also help you regulate your body temperature.</p><h3>What extra features of hiking pants for women do you need?</h3><p>Pockets, pockets, and more pockets. Seriously, hiking pants need to be functional, but to maximize your comfort, look for pants with zippers for venting, a built-in belt or loops, a gusseted crotch, and articulated knees.</p><h3>Do I need hiking pants, outdoor pants, functional pants, or trekking pants?</h3><p>Good question with a simple answer: A good pair of hiking pants can serve many purposes, including hiking, climbing, and mountaineering.</p><h3>What insulation should my hiking pants have?</h3><p>It depends on what activities you have planned. If you are doing things in the winter, softshell pants often come with a fleece lining to help insulate you. The beauty of hiking pants is that base layers can be worn underneath for added protection from the cold.</p><h3>How do waterproof finishes differ for hiking pants?</h3><p>There is no such thing as waterproof clothing. Exposure to the elements and washing will diminish the amount of water resistance your outdoor clothing provides. The good news is that you can restore their water resistance between washes by applying beeswax or water resistance sprays.</p><h3>What practical details should hiking pants have?</h3><p>If you want pants that will offer maximum mobility without dragging you down, look for hiking trousers made from stretchy nylon fabric with leg zippers for venting, crotch gusseting, articulated knee darts. Nylon fabric will help move moisture away from your skin to keep you warm and dry while gussets and knee darts will ensure you can move through the most challenging terrain with ease.</p><h3>What hiking pants should I wear in the summer?</h3><p>Unless I plan to go bushwacking, I tend to wear running shorts but always carry my Patagonia Torrentshell 3L Pants for rain and wind protection and an extra layer of warmth in a pinch. However, quick-drying, lightweight Outdoor Research Ferrosi Pants are an excellent option for summer hikes, and have an elastic cinch cord at the cuff for additional venting and breathability.</p>",375
251,backpacking sleeping bags,,"<h2>FAQs on backpacking sleeping bags</h2><h3>How do you pack a sleeping bag in a backpack?</h3><p>The best way to pack a sleeping bag is to invert it and stuff it into a compression stuff sack to smash it to the smallest possible mass. Place lighter items like sleeping bags at the bottom of your pack and heavier items higher up between your shoulders. Make sure you put down insulated bags in a waterproof stuff sack or waterproof the main compartment of your backpack with a large leaf bag.</p><h3>What's the best size sleeping bag for backpacking?</h3><p>Get the one that matches your height most closely. Most mid- and high-end bag manufacturers offer their bags in regular (up to 72 inches) or long (up to 78 inches). Some offer small or short variants (around 66 inches), and some premium manufacturers even offer small, regular, and large girth size options. Other high-end manufacturers offer made-to-order custom bags.</p><h3>How heavy should a backpacking sleeping bag be?</h3><p>Look for the lightest bag that meets your desired temperature range. Most good three-season bags weigh less than two pounds, and good four-season bags weigh less than three pounds.</p><h3>What's the difference between a backpacking and camping sleeping bag?</h3><p>Backpacking bags are much lighter, more compressible, and more efficient in terms of warmth-to-weight ratios due to high power (800+) down fill, thin high-tensile shell material, and mummy-shaped form-fitting design.</p><h3>How is down fill power measured?</h3><p>Down is measured by fill power - how much loft and volume it provides per ounce. It's a relative measure of down quality in terms of fluffiness. Fill power is a measure of how many cubic inches of loft that one ounce of down produces. For instance, 650 fill power down means one ounce by weight will provide 650 cubic inches of loft and thus dead trapped air. Similarly, one ounce of 800 fill power down will provide an additional 150 cubic inches of loft - more insulation for the same weight. The higher the number, the higher the quality. Note that you need to combine fill power with fill weight to determine how warm a sleeping bag is because a bag with 10 ounces of 600 fill down won't be nearly as warm as a bag with 10 ounces of 800 fill down.</p>",372

86,weighted vests,,"<h2>FAQs on weighted vests</h2><p>A weighted vest will help your fitness by increasing the level of exertion required to complete a given task. If you'd like a working example, do a set of 10 bodyweight squats. Not too hard, right? Now grab a 25-pound weight (or something approximate) and do another 10 squats. Pretty big difference. The increased excretion helps to burn more calories and build more muscle, which are the two primary goals of working out in the first place.</p><p>This depends a lot on your current level of fitness and your overall fitness goals, but a good rule of thumb for the average person is about 10 percent of your current body weight as a maximum.</p><p>Yes. Should you? Well, that's a different story. Again, this is completely dependent on your goals and your current fitness, not to mention what you do all day. If you work at a desk all day or sit around watching bad daytime TV, it's probably not worth the effort. Also, if you're not used to a weighted vest, you shouldn't jump right into wearing it all day long. Work your way up to longer periods and, even then, allow yourself some time away from it, if for no other reason than to let your skin breathe. Many soldiers wear their vest for long periods of time, just in the normal course of work, but then again most of us end up with bad backs and knees.</p><p>Yes, but the vest is only part of the answer. A weighted vest will help you burn more calories in whatever activity you're doing, but keep in mind that weight loss is primarily diet-driven. If calories burnt is greater than calories consumed, you'll lose weight. Long story short, you can't up your food intake to match your exertion.</p><p>You can perform pretty much any type of exercise in a weighted vest, but you want to make sure you're smart about what you're doing. For example, running with large amounts of weight can be detrimental to your back and joints, especially if you don't build up appropriately. High impact, repetitious activities might be better served with lower weights and a good long build-up period.</p>",362

105,cabin tents,,"<h2>FAQs on cabin tents</h2><h3>How do you set up a cabin tent?</h3><p>Most cabin tents are very similar in setup, and consist of poles and rods (often fiberglass) that create a frame to support the outer fabric. Stakes are used to secure the tent to the ground, and more stakes used with guylines to help spread out windows and the rainfly. Be sure to follow the directions provided by the tent makers. When you get a new tent (or are gifted a used one), always set it up completely at home before using it for camping. You don't want to find out that there's a huge gash in it, during a rainstorm while on vacation</p><h3>What is the purpose of a cabin tent?</h3><p>A cabin tent is a great way for a family or group of people to camp together at an established or easy to get to camp site. They're designed to be much larger and a little more sturdy than dome tents, which are smaller and designed to be carried into more remote locations.</p><h3>Are cabin tents waterproof?</h3><p>This varies from tent to tent, but many are not actually waterproof. Most are ""water resistant"", so they can hold up to a light rain for a while, but will eventually start to leak. Always check the tent's product page when you buy to understand what kind of waterproofing/resistance your tent has. A waterproof rainfly (which is often, but not always, included) is a great way to increase a tent's ability to keep out precipitation.</p><h3>Do cabin tents lose their waterproofing?</h3><p>Yes. The amount of use and type of weather you expose your tent to will have an impact on how often you should re-waterproof it. It might seem a little counter-intuitive, but if you find yourself often camping in areas that expose your tent to little rain but lots of direct sunlight, you'll need to re-waterproof it before too long. The sunlight can actually break down or dry out the tent's waterproofing. For regular use, think about applying a waterproofing agent every couple of years.</p>",338
29,gun cleaning kits,,"<h2>FAQs on gun cleaning kits</h2><h3>Do you have to clean a gun if you don't use it?</h3><p>It depends on your storage area. If you keep your guns in a cool and dry place, then probably not, but if your guns are stored in a wet or humid area, then you should occasionally check your guns for rust. If you see rust, you should lightly clean away the rust and apply a light coat of oil to protect your firearm.</p><h3>Are you supposed to clean a brand-new gun?</h3><p>A better way to ask this question is ""when should I clean a brand new gun?"" A ""new gun"" by definition has never been used (except for a single test fire at the factory), so it shouldn't be dirty. However, the best answer is to follow the guidelines in the instruction manual. Still, if it makes you more comfortable cleaning it before shooting it, by all means, clean it.</p><h3>What gun cleaning kit does the military use?</h3><p>The U.S. military issues multiple different gun cleaning kits. The Otis Technology IWCK and the Otis Technology Tactical Cleaning Kit are two such cleaning kits.</p><h3>How often should you clean your gun?</h3><p>Opinions on this vary widely, so a definitive answer can be hard to nail down. Generally speaking, we'd say a good routine is probably to conduct a dry (i.e., no liquids) cleaning every 250 rounds/monthly and a wet/deep cleaning annually/every 3,000 rounds. If your guns spend lots of time in the safe, then we'd recommend wet-cleaning them after every range trip.</p><h3>Can you clean a gun without a kit?</h3><p>Only if you plan to build your own kit. So, no.</p><h3>What happens if you don't clean your gun?</h3><p>With time, your firearm will deteriorate. Depending on the gun, it will rust or corrode and the barrel may start pitting, destroying its accuracy and degrading its structural integrity. In an absolute worst-case scenario, extreme corrosion could turn your barrel into a homemade hand grenade or a first-class rust bucket.</p>",323
167,4 season tents,,"<h2>FAQs about 4-season tents</h2><h3>What's the difference between a 3-season and 4-season tent?</h3><p>A 3-season tent refers to a tent that's suitable for camping in the spring, summer, and fall. A 4-season tent can be used during any of those seasons but also covers winter. All-season tents are designed to be versatile enough to use in the summer when camping involves optimal cooling ventilation, but sturdy and insulating enough to provide shelter during winter weather.</p><p>If you're exclusively looking for a backpacking tent for summer adventures, a 4-season tent could be overkill and leave you carrying more weight than necessary.</p><h3>Do I need a 4-season tent for winter?</h3><p>If you plan on overnighting in extreme weather in winter temps, you're probably best off with a 4-season tent for camping. While a 3-season tent could suffice for winter camping in some regions, a 4-season tent offers better protection and insulation in harsher conditions like snow or high winds. Good 4-season tents are also built to withstand the weight of snow accumulation which might not be true of a 3-season tent. Boiled down, if you plan on doing harsh winter-weather camping, a 4-season tent is a safer bet to keep you protected from the elements.</p><h3>How do you keep the bottom of a tent dry?</h3><p>No one likes to retire to a soggy tent after a day of adventure, so you'll want to keep the bottom of the tent dry, regardless of whether it's a 4-season or 3-season tent. To do this, you'll want to lay down a footprint under your tent that creates a barrier between the ground and the tent. Some tents are sold with a footprint, but you might need to purchase one separately. Almost every tent manufacturer sells footprints that fit the dimensions of the tents they make. You can also opt for a ground tarp, but you'll want to have a system to anchor it down well in case the wind starts howling.</p>",319
24,hunting backpacks,,"<h2>FAQs about hunting backpacks</h2><h3>Why do I need a hunting backpack?</h3><p>Try stuffing enough gear, food, ammo, shelter, and other equipment for a three-day elk hunt into your hunting pants pockets, and you'll get your answer. If things go your way, you'll quickly realize that elk quarters aren't exactly pocket-sized.</p><h3>What size hunting backpack should I get?</h3><p>For cargo capacity, the ""right size"" hunting backpack varies from hunter to hunter and from hunt to hunt. When in doubt, figure about 1,000 cubic inches per day.</p><p>The ""right size"" backpack frame depends on your torso size. To determine your torso size, check out this video. When in doubt about pack sizing, contact the manufacturer.</p><h3>Which frame should I choose?</h3><p>Hunting backpack frames are not interchangeable across brands. If you want an Eberlestock pack, then get the (correct) Eberlestock frame.</p><h3>Why do some backpacks have a hip belt?</h3><p>Hip belts, especially in conjunction with load lifters or other suspension systems, do an excellent job of redistributing weight away from the shoulder to one of the body's best load-bearing structures, closer to your center of gravity. This makes heavy loads more comfortable and improves stability while on the move.</p><h3>What should I pack in my hunting backpack?</h3><p>What kind of game are you hunting and how long do you plan to stay in the field? Besides a first aid kit, food, water, lighting, and emergency survival gear, your packing list will heavily depend on how you answer those two questions.</p><h3>How do I clean and wash my hunting backpack?</h3><p>Follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions printed on the tag. It may not feel manly, but it could save you hundreds.</p><h3>How do I adjust my hunting backpack?</h3><p>Start with all the pack's straps loosened. Center your hip belt on the top of your hip bone (iliac crest) and tighten the straps. Next, snug up (but don't overtighten) the shoulder straps, load lifters (on top of the shoulder straps), and sternum strap. Click here for a visual rundown.</p>",318
94,north face backpacks,,"<h2>FAQs about North Face backpacks</h2><h3>How good are North Face backpacks?</h3><p>The North Face has a reputation for producing quality products, and its backpacks are no different. Plenty of TNF packs have endured years of heavy use without breaking a sweat. Whenever you purchase a TNF pack, you will pay for the name, but the quality that goes with it usually will justify the price.</p><h3>How much protection do North Face backpacks offer your belongings?</h3><p>As backpacks go, The North Face's packs do a good job of providing protection for your gear. In addition to water-resistant finishes, TNF's bags usually include fleece-lined phone and tablet sleeves, as well as padded laptop sleeves. Some laptop sleeves are even suspended for extra protection, although don't bother trying to predict which packs will have it.</p><h3>Are North Face backpacks good for your back?</h3><p>That depends on what you mean. The North Face backpacks equipped with the FlexVent suspension system are certified by the American Chiropractic Association, which basically means the system is designed to anatomically match your back and shoulders. Of course, a heavily loaded pack won't do your body much good over long periods of time no matter how good the ergonomics.</p><h3>Do all North Face backpacks include a lifetime warranty?</h3><p>All North Face backpacks come with a limited lifetime guarantee. This means that if the bag fails due to a manufacturing defect, it's covered so long as it isn't a ""renewed"" pack. Unfortunately, packs are only warranted to the original owner. For more details, visit the company's warranty page.</p><h3>What North Face backpack has the most room?</h3><p>The L/XL version of the Griffin 75 offers a whopping 74 liters of cargo capacity, while the S/M ""only"" offers 69 liters. Of course, most city dwellers will need or use such a pack, so take a look at the Router which has 40 liters of space inside. The women's Surge is the largest women's backpack, coming in at 31 liters.</p>",317
216,backpacking sleeping pads,,"<h2>FAQs on backpacking sleeping pads</h2><h3>What is R-value?</h3><p>The R-value is short for ""resistance value"" and refers to the pad's ability to resist heat transference. High R-value sleeping pads are better for cold weather while lower R-value pads are better for warmer temperatures.</p><h3>What is a good weight for a backpacking sleeping pad?</h3><p>The answer to this question truly depends on what you intend to do. For those looking to through-hike or do multi-day backpacking excursions, you'll want an ultralight pad weighing one pound or less. If you're only going on a one or two-day trip then you would probably be fine with something under five pounds. Anything over five pounds would be best for car camping or other uses that don't require you to carry the pad.</p><h3>Can I use more than one sleeping pad?</h3><p>Yes, but I don't encourage more than two. The best way to do this would be to use a closed-cell foam pad as the base and place an open-cell foam or air core pad on top. This is a great way to amplify the R-values, especially on frozen terrain.</p><h3>How to store a sleeping pad?</h3><p>For closed-cell foam pads, they are easily rolled or folded up and can be stored naked or in a case. Open-cell foam pads can be rolled up as well but for long-term storage, it is a good idea to keep it semi-inflated so the foam doesn't stay compressed. Air core pads can be simply stored in their carrying case after deflating and rolling them up.</p><h3>How do I choose the right size and shape sleeping pad?</h3><p>Ultimately the size of the pad will be determined by your height as you should be able to lay on the pad without your feet or head touching the ground. The shape is trickier only in the sense that it is a personal preference. The shape doesn't matter unless you plan to put your pad inside of your sleeping bag.</p>",317
92,binoculars for hunting,,"<h2>FAQs on hunting binoculars</h2><h3>What do the numbers mean when buying binoculars?</h3><p>The first number in the model designation indicates the magnification power of the binoculars, which tells you by how many times the image you're seeing is enlarged. The most common magnification powers on the market are 8x, 10x, and 12x. The second number in the model designation is the objective lens diameter, which is measured in millimeters. The larger the objective lens, the more light will be captured by the binoculars, creating a brighter, clearer image. Unfortunately, the larger lenses also add extra weight.</p><h3>What should I look for when buying binoculars?</h3><p>The best bet is to look for binoculars that have fully multi-coated lenses. This means that all lens surfaces have been treated with multiple layers of coating to increase light transmission, reduce glare, and protect the lens from scratching or chipping. You should also ensure the binoculars are waterproofed and either Argon or Nitrogen purged to prevent internal fogging.</p><h3>What size binocular lenses are best for hunting?</h3><p>This is dependent on your style of hunting. If you are on the move constantly, you may not want heavy or bulky binoculars, so a pair with a lower objective lens size might be more beneficial. If you are a stationary hunter, having something with a greater objective lens will help brighten the images you glass.</p><h3>What is the best binocular magnification for hunting?</h3><p>For hunting in wooded areas where there are not long lines of sight, it is best to go with a magnification level of 8x or 10x. These levels will be more than adequate and will make it easier to find your intended target. When hunting large expanses, it may be more beneficial to go with a 12x or 15x magnification, depending on how far you're looking. Keep in mind that the greater magnification will also enhance the shake in your hands, so a trusty tripod might be beneficial.</p>",315
12,ar 15 scopes,,"<h2>FAQs on AR-15 scopes</h2><h3>What optics do the Navy SEALs use?</h3><p>Navy SEALs use many different types of optics, including the optics that were listed here. The EoTech EXPS in particular has been spotted in heavy rotation since its inception. However, no list is ever going to be truly comprehensive, given the dizzying speed at which new optics are developed and adopted among special operations forces.</p><h3>What is the clearest rifle scope?</h3><p>In my personal experience, Trijicon has produced some of the clearest magnified optics out there, with both the ACOG and VCOG providing gloriously sharp images and great light transmission that's comparable with the naked eye. This should be taken with a grain of salt because I've never had the chance to look through something from Schmidt & Bender or anything of that caliber.</p><h3>What is an LPVO scope?</h3><p>Low power variable optics (LPVO) are optics that feature a relatively low maximum magnification, but allow you to cycle through magnifications to get a sight picture that fits the task and hand. Whether they're older types like the Elcan Specter, or the latest 2.5-8x optic being fielded by the Marine Corps on the M38 Squad Designated Marksman Rifle system, LPVOs are excellent when you expect to engage targets at a variety of unpredictable distances.</p><h3>What magnification is needed for AR-15 scopes?</h3><p>The magnification needed will change based on the task at hand. In general, I've found that unmagnified optics are capable for addressing targets less than 100 yards away; 4x magnification for 300 yards; and 8x or higher for 500 yards or more. If you anticipate engaging targets at a wide variety of distances, it might be worth it to shell out for a quality LPVO, which gives you the flexibility to adjust the magnification on the fly.</p><h3>Why do you need fancy optics? Back in my day we shot iron sights on the M16A1 and we liked it! This new Corps…</h3><p>OK, Boomer.</p>",314

106,spotting scopes,,"<h2>FAQs on spotting scopes</h2><h3>What is a spotting scope used for?</h3><p>Spotting scopes are used to see accurately at great distances. Hunters and wildlife tour guides use them to observe and identify animals without disturbing them. At the range, spotting scopes allow shooters to evaluate their shot placement without leaving the bench.</p><h3>Can you use a telescope as a spotting scope?</h3><p>It's possible, but we wouldn't recommend it. Telescopes tend to be much larger and more fragile than a spotting scope.</p><h3>Can I attach a camera to my spotting scope?</h3><p>Yes, and that's a great way to get the most out of it. Wildlife guides and hunters both use this technique to take pictures of the animals they see. You might be surprised by how well the pictures turn out.</p><h3>What makes a spotting scope good for hunting?</h3><p>Spotting scopes allow hunters to see far beyond what's possible with the naked eye, binoculars, or a rifle scope. They allow much better target identification and can scan distant terrain much more effectively than less-powerful optics.</p><h3>How should I carry my spotting scope?</h3><p>Spotting scopes are built for hunters who will be carrying them across rugged terrain in all kinds of weather. That being said, they're still precision optics and it's a good idea to take care of them with a padded case when possible.</p><h3>What do the numbers on a spotting scope mean?</h3><p>Numbers before the X indicate the fixed or telescopic range of magnification. The number after the X indicates the objective lens size in millimeters. A scope labeled 10-20×40 can zoom between 10- and 20-power magnification and has an objective lens that's 40 millimeters in diameter.</p><h3>What magnifications are typical for spotting scopes?</h3><p>Most spotting is probably done between 30- and 40-power magnification. Plenty of spotting scopes reach far beyond that, and there are times when that's useful.

146,climbing packs,,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>All the climbing packs in this review were selected based on performance reputation, hands-on inspection, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. We take our time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.</p><h3>FAQs on climbing backpacks</h3><h3>How do I know what size pack to get?</h3><p>There are two essential considerations on pack sizes. First, get a pack that fits your body (torso and waist measurements), and second, get a pack that's big enough to support the climbing you are going to do. It's useful to think of this in terms of days.</p><h3>Do I need ice axe and crampon retention systems?</h3><p>Yes, if you care about living and are going to move over snow and ice. If you're not moving over snow and ice (check the weather forecast), then you might consider a pack without them to save weight.</p><h3>Can I get away with just one pack?</h3><p>It depends. There's a lot of versatility in the 35- to 50-liter range of packs. If in doubt, go with the larger pack that has compression straps and a longer snow skirt that enables overstuffing. I've used one trusty 40-liter pack for years and it met most of my needs reliably.</p><h3>What's the best way to determine what size I need to fit my body?</h3><p>Check each manufacturer's specs for the torso length and hip belt dimensions. Most manufacturers make climbing packs in small/medium and medium/large sizes. The best thing is to try them on in the store with a load in the main storage chamber. Even better is to buy them online from a reputable retailer with a solid return policy, take them to a climbing gym, treat them carefully, and see how they perform on a wall.</p>",305
52,boot knives,,"<h2>FAQs on boot knives</h2><h3>Are boot knives illegal?</h3><p>It's not illegal to own a boot knife, but your state might regulate knives in other ways. For example, some states prohibit concealing a knife and/or carrying a knife with a blade longer than a specified length. Therefore, you should always review your state laws before strapping on a boot knife.</p><h3>How practical is a boot knife?</h3><p>At the risk of angering boot knife enthusiasts, I'd say not super practical for anyone who isn't trained in handling weapons in hand-to-hand combat. They are great if you want to have a knife available and don't want the clip showing for whatever reason. But if you want it for self-defense and aren't trained, the boot knife might not be reliable.</p><h3>How do you wear a boot knife?</h3><p>It varies by design, but generally you secure the sheath to your boot or around your ankle with a clip or strap. When you plan to carry it this way, you have to be careful that it doesn't rub against your skin and that the blade stays secure. If concealment isn't a concern, you could go full combat-style and tie it around your boot with your boot laces. Another good option is an ankle wrap like this one from Gerber. And of course, you can wear it on your belt.</p><h3>Should I buy a single- or double-edge boot knife?</h3><p>It depends on how you intend on using your boot knife. Either edge works for EDC, but a double-edge works better for self-defense because you won't have to keep track of the business end. Still, like you can see with the Kershaw Secret Agent, even with a single-edge, you can stab and slash effectively.</p><h3>How much does a boot knife weigh?</h3><p>They tend to be light and narrow, which is better for concealment. Most knives weigh anywhere from two to nine ounces.</p>",304
199,running shorts for women,,"<h2>FAQs on women's running shorts</h2><h3>Why do women's running shorts have liners?</h3><p>It isn't just women's running shorts that come with liners. Many men's running shorts have them, too. In addition to providing support for your nether regions, a running short liner helps wick moisture away from your crotch, which, let's be honest, doesn't come equipped with a fan and can get pretty sticky during physically demanding activity. A good liner can also help maintain your body temperature.</p><h3>Why is there netting in women's running shorts?</h3><p>Netting or mesh inserts commonly found in the legs of women's running shorts serve as vents to allow heat and moisture to escape. They also promote circulation and airflow, keeping you cool and dry on your runs.</p><h3>What do female athletes wear under their running shorts?</h3><p>There is no one right answer to this question (and shame on you for asking!), but most female athletes don't wear anything under their shorts, particularly if their running shorts come with a breathable liner that wicks moisture away from the skin. If they wear shorts without a brief-style liner, they might wear spandex or compression-style underwear. The crazy thing is that when I asked Google this question, 37,000,000 results showed up, indicating that the world is a very, very sick place.</p><h3>Will the proprietary fabric in my women's running shorts help me run faster?</h3><p>Unless you are the beautiful and accomplished Elaine Thompson-Herah, sadly, chances are, no. While proprietary fabrics may help you stay cooler and drier for longer, you won't likely run much faster as a result of wearing them.

Folks tend to think if they spend enough money, they can get the ""best"" backpack. It's true that there are quality brands (like all the brands listed above), but take a moment to skim through product reviews of even the best backpacking packs, and you'll see complaints of all sorts related to fit. Like running shoes, you want a pack that best fits your body type, and the way you find that is either by trial and error or by a professional fitting.</p><h3>How big of a backpack do you need for a three- to five-day backpacking trip?</h3><p>Generally speaking, you'll want to have a 50L backpacking pack for up to three days in the backcountry, and 50L to 70L for longer trips. As you get more experienced and learn to plan and slim down your load, you can find that 50L bags can carry you a long way.</p><h3>Which is better for backpacking backpacks, Deuter or Osprey?</h3><p>Obviously, it's a personal choice because both are high-quality brands. The Germany-based Deuter is very popular in Europe, while Osprey rules in the United States. Personally, I prefer Osprey backpacks because they're a little lighter and packed with features. But I was impressed with the Aircontact Core. Both deserve to be ranked among the best backpacking brands.</p><h3>Are hiking backpacks worth it?</h3><p>Yes. The best hiking backpacks and the best backpacking packs are designed to distribute the weight of your gear so that you can actually enjoy your time in the backcountry and experience the adventure you're seeking. You can find some good bargains (like the REI Co-op Trailbreak 60 listed above), but skimp too much and you risk gear failure when it's least convenient.</p>",298
201,running watches,,"<h2>FAQs on running watches</h2><h3>What should I look for in a running watch?</h3><p>At a minimum, you're going to want a watch that accurately tracks your heart rate and GPS position, and provides you feedback on your workouts so you can target performance improvement.</p><h3>What is a good running watch for beginners?</h3><p>If you are looking to try a running watch but aren't fully committed to paying hundreds of dollars for capabilities you might not need, check out the Garmin Forerunner 45. It's basic, but will give you the basics: heart rate, GPS tracks, access to Garmin Coach, smart notifications, incident detection and assistance, and up to seven days of battery life all for just over $100.</p><h3>How useful is a running watch?</h3><p>Not to be cute, but it's as useful as you make it. I've found that tracking workout data motivates me to exercise more frequently and longer. It also helps track your weekly workouts to keep you honest. You'll train better with better data, and that's the whole point.</p><h3>Running watch vs. fitness tracker?</h3><p>If you want to accurately track your workout distance and pace and want to leave your phone at home, get a GPS running watch. If you want to track your walking or stair climbing, but accuracy isn't a priority, get a fitness tracker.</p><h3>How much should I spend on a fitness watch?</h3><p>It depends. If you want a basic watch, about $120. If you want some premium functions but not a premium price, about $250. If you want the very best, you're looking at $550 and up.</p><h3>Do I need a running watch?</h3><p>No. You can get off your ass, lace up your running shoes, and run - but you won't get any workout data that way and might get lost because you don't have GPS and you failed land nav class.</p>",296
205,climbing harnesses,,"<h2>FAQs about climbing harnesses</h2><h3>Can you rock climb without a harness?</h3><p>Yes, you can climb without a harness. If you've seen the award-winning documentary Free Solo with legendary climber Alex Honnold, your palms dripped with sweat as he climbed a massive wall without a harness or rope. But most of us feel a heck of a lot more comfortable climbing with a harness. Should you lose grip of a hold or experience a foot slip, a rock climbing harness is there to catch your fall. It's also possible to rock climb without a harness if you're bouldering. Rather than scaling big walls, bouldering is climbing on shorter routes that usually don't go higher than 15 feet.</p><h3>Is there a difference between men's and women's climbing harnesses?</h3><p>Yep, men's and women's climbing harnesses are different. The primary difference is in the rise of the harness, and the distance between the leg loops and the waist belt. Rock climbing harnesses designed for feminine figures have a longer rise when compared to men's. It's also common for women's harnesses to have smaller leg loops, but that's not always the case, especially if they're adjustable.</p><h3>How should a climbing harness fit?</h3><p>The fit of your rock climbing harness is incredibly important to how comfortable you'll feel while wearing it and also plays into its functionality. An ill-fitting harness could be dangerous and lead to injury if you were to fall. Experts say a rock climbing harness should feel snug but not pinch anywhere. The typical rule of thumb is that you should be able to fit two fingers or less between the harness and your body in both the waistband area and the leg loops. The exception to this rule is if the leg loops have elastic material so the stretch might allow for more room.</p>",296

194,camping blankets,,"<h2>FAQs about camping blankets</h2><h3>Which is better for camping, a sleeping bag or blanket?</h3><p>This depends on your camping situation and preferences. A sleeping bag is generally larger, heavier, and bulkier/less packable than a blanket, but is typically warmer than a blanket. Also, there are many more sleeping bag options on the market than camping blankets at this time, so finding a sleeping bag for a particular situation may be easier than finding a camping blanket. However, a camping blanket is typically more versatile than a sleeping bag and, along with reduced weight and increased packability, it might be the right choice for your camping situation.</p><h3>How do I choose a camping blanket?</h3><p>There are several major considerations when choosing a camping blanket. Most importantly is comfort. How cold is it going to be where you're going? Is there a ""comfort side"" to the blanket? Next is weight and packability. Are you going on a several-day hiking or camping trip? If so, you'll want a light, compact blanket. Durability and water resistance are important considerations as well. For car-based camping without pets, a lighter-duty blanket may work. For backpacking or camping with dogs, you'll want a tougher blanket.</p><h3>Do Mylar camping blankets really work?</h3><p>Mylar blankets have several legitimate uses. If you're counting on mylar to be your sole warmth-retaining layer, you'll be disappointed. However, when combined with a more traditional sleeping bag, blanket, or clothing layers, mylar does help to keep wind and rain at bay and to retain heat. Mylar blankets can also be used as a ground sheet, to reflect campfire heat back to you, or for signaling. Given their extremely compact size when folded and their light weight, adding a Mylar blanket to your camping kit is not a bad idea.</p>",289
153,medicine balls,,"<h2>FAQs about medicine balls</h2><h3>What is the best weight and size for a medicine ball?</h3><p>It depends on your use. For basic workouts such as lunges, twists, and squats, a medium to small ball - 12 inches and below - would be easier to grip and available in lower weights. Wall balls and slam balls will be heavier for bodybuilding types and are larger for easier catching and better impact distribution.</p><h3>What are the best medicine ball workouts for abs?</h3><p>From personal experience, choose something where you can get a solid, sturdy grip. Skip slippery surfaces such as leather or non-textured rubber. Use something with handles or at least textured rubber, and preferably a smaller diameter that's easy to hold closely without your arms positioned awkwardly.</p><h3>Are medicine balls with handles better?</h3><p>It depends on what you're trying to achieve. Slamming and throwing? Most definitely not. But for gripping during ab workouts or even using for curls and tricep extensions in lieu of kettlebells? Medicine balls with handles may be the perfect, do-it-all purchase.</p><h3>What is the difference between a medicine ball and a wall ball?</h3><p>Wall balls are essentially medicine balls bulked up and reinforced to handle more strenuous workouts. They will be available in heavier weights and larger sizes, and sport leather or vinyl exteriors to withstand the impacts of being thrown about. Of course, you can still use them as regular medicine balls.</p><h3>Can you build muscle with a medicine ball?</h3><p>You absolutely can, just as you could with nearly any other piece of equipment. You're adding resistance and training your body to overcome it, especially as you increase the weight. Most medicine balls can be used in place of dumbbells or kettlebells for things like ab twists, curls, squats, and more.</p>",285
8,kydex holsters,,"<h2>FAQs about Kydex holsters</h2><h3>Do Kydex holsters scratch guns?</h3><p>Most modern firearms finishes aren't ""scratched"" by Kydex, but the plastic may leave a black residue on the finish that looks unsightly. The best solution to this is a little TLC and CLP. Pistols with mirror-polished finishes, gold plating, and so forth might possibly be marred by drawing and re-holstering in any material, due to things like dirt and other debris getting caught inside the holster. If you're worried about scratching the finish on your handgun, it's probably not a carry piece.</p><h3>Which is better, leather or Kydex?</h3><p>Kydex by far is the superior option, offering a degree of retention, full trigger protection, and a perfect fit every time. Leather holsters don't retain your firearm without things like thumb break straps, and they don't protect the trigger from outside manipulation or from catching on the edge of the holster, especially as the leather softens. This can cause a negligent discharge, and injure or kill the carrier.</p><h3>How long does a Kydex holster last?</h3><p>Kydex holsters last for a while, due to the fact that the material doesn't soften or degrade like leather. However, parts of the holster like the screws can loosen, and some cheaper holsters can break or crack due to the hard plastic becoming brittle. Periodically inspect your holster for cracks, and if you see them, replace it.</p><h3>Is Kydex IWB comfortable?</h3><p>No less comfortable than other options. Carrying a pistol comfortably is more dependent on the type of pistol being carried, the carrier's body type, and whether or not they use things like a proper pistol belt. Things like wedges, claws, and sweat guards further enhance comfort and make your pistol something you can carry on a daily basis.</p>",283

180,running shorts for men,,"<h2>FAQs on running shorts for men</h2><h3>Should running shorts be tight or loose?</h3><p>This is largely a personal choice. Unless you're Pietro Maximoff, you aren't going to run fast enough for your shorts to affect your aerodynamics and speed, so go with what works best for you.</p><h3>How does the length of men's running shorts affect performance?</h3><p>This depends on the type of running you are doing and the level of performance you can bring to the table. For sprinting, for example, you may want to avoid the longer shorts with five- to seven-inch inseams. The added material can bunch up and get in the way. On the other hand, you might want to avoid two-inch inseam split shorts for a long trail run.</p><h3>What's the best material for a pair of men's running shorts?</h3><p>The best material for men's running shorts is a synthetic fabric like polyester. Cotton is the enemy. Cotton is great for a cool shirt with your favorite band or sports team, but for running shorts, you would just be inviting sweat, humidity, and moisture to join you and ruin your day. Stick with something that wicks the moisture away from your body and has enough breathability to allow air to flow.</p><h3>Should I look for a pair of men's running shorts with a liner?</h3><p>Running shorts with a quality liner are great because they limit the layers of clothing you need when running, but not all liners are created equal. A good liner provides comfortable support and can help mitigate chafing. Liners do, however, have a tendency to stretch and wear out over time. If this happens, you can simply cut the offending liner out and replace it with a pair of quality underwear.</p>",281
147,hardshell jackets,,"<h2>FAQs about hardshell jackets</h2><h3>Do hardshell jackets keep you warm?</h3><p>Hardshell jackets protect against wind and rain, which will help you stay warm, but they don't have insulation. Your hardshell jacket should be large enough to fit over an appropriately insulated mid layer so you can add and remove layers throughout the day as necessary.</p><h3>What's the difference between hardshell and softshell jackets?</h3><p>Think of hardshell jackets as an evolution of the rain jacket. Softshell rain jackets might use two layers of material to create a waterproof barrier, but they aren't very durable. Hardshell jackets usually use three layers of material and are built to take more physical abuse. If you're just going to be running from the car to work in the rain, save some money and get a lightweight softshell jacket. If you're going to be breaking trail in the mountains, you need a hardshell jacket.</p><h3>Are hardshell jackets windproof?</h3><p>Yes, hardshell jackets are windproof and waterproof. They also hold up well against pokes and scrapes.</p><h3>What is the most eco-friendly hardshell jacket?</h3><p>Making the best products for the environment isn't always about sustainable materials and efficient manufacturing processes. One of the best things you can do is keep products out of the landfill. Patagonia is making that easier than ever by offering its already environmentally-friendly products available as used items that deserve a second lease on life. Check them out and save some money with the Worn Wear program.</p><h3>Is a hardshell jacket worth it?</h3><p>Hardshell jackets are an investment. If you plan on hiking, camping, skiing, or otherwise spending time in unforgiving environments, a hardshell jacket will earn its keep in no time. If you spend your free time in town, it's probably not necessary.</p>",279
108,molle pouches,,"<h2>FAQs about magazine pouches</h2><h3>What is a MOLLE pouch?</h3><p>A MOLLE pouch is any pouch that can attach to MOLLE or PALS webbing by means of straps, clips, or hooks. Newer types of webbing use laser cut material where the fabric of the carrier has slots cut directly into it for mounting, which saves on weight and bulk.</p><h3>What MOLLE pouch does the military use?</h3><p>Short answer is ""many different types,"" but in general, the MOLLE pouches that are officially sanctioned and purchased by the military must be Berry Amendment-compliant, meaning they have to be made in the USA of materials either from the USA or select allied countries. A quick way to tell is to see if the pouch in question carries an NSN, or National Stock Number. That means that the item in question has been entered into the GSA catalog, and can be purchased through official government channels. Brands that are commonly used by the military are Eagle Industries, High Speed Gear, Inc, Blue Force Gear, First Spear, S&S Precision, London Bridge Trading, Crye Precision, Tyr Tactical, and Paraclete. Every pouch on this list is made in the USA, and most of them are Berry compliant and carry an NSN.</p><h3>What is the best AR-15 magazine pouch?</h3><p>Overall, the best that we tested is the HSGI Taco pouch. It balances retention with ease of use, and supports many types of magazines, while being cost effective and readily available.</p><h3>What is the best competition magazine pouch?</h3><p>The best competition magazine pouch that we tested is the Safariland 774.

129,home gyms,,"<h2>FAQs on home gyms</h2><h3>Are home gyms worth it for beginners?</h3><p>Home gyms are often a great way for beginners to ""get their feet wet"" when it comes to exercise and proper form. Many newbies find going to a public club daunting and intimidating. They don't want to look silly or do the exercises the wrong way. In that respect, a home gym can be a great way for a beginner to get comfortable when it comes to getting started on a physical fitness routine.</p><h3>How much space do you need for a home gym?</h3><p>Depending on the gym you choose, you can do a solid workout in the space between your bed and dresser. Our top portable pick or a suspension trainer lets you turn your living room, hallway, entryway, etc. into a temporary gym space that's easy to convert back to living space when you're done with your workout. Heck, you can even turn a doorway into a home gym by simply adding a pull-up bar. Most free-standing, stationary home gyms require a space of at least four feet x four feet in order to allow you enough room to safely perform most of the exercises.</p><h3>Are home gyms effective?</h3><p>Home gyms are a highly effective means of exercise. Most of them are modeled after commercial gym equipment and strive to offer the same or very similar exercise experiences as what you would get at a commercial gym. Most home gyms also come with tutorial charts, DVDs, or apps that teach you how to properly and safely do the recommended exercises. Some even come with proposed workout routines and meal plans to help you really maximize your home workout results.<br/>",276
14,damascus knives,,"<h2>FAQs on Damascus knives</h2><h3>How good is Damascus steel for knives?</h3><p>It varies greatly, but quality Damascus is perfectly fine, it's worth noting that nothing currently on the market outperforms mono-steels like CPM S35VN or other common premium steels. And unfortunately, the cheaper, low quality Damascus that is frequently peddled can have serious issues, including poor edge retention, delamination, and rust.</p><h3>Do Damascus Knives rust?</h3><p>Any steel will rust, given the right conditions and a high enough carbon content, but you'll mainly see corrosion on pattern-welded Damascus that uses high-carbon steels like 1095. It's imperative that you keep non-stainless Damascus properly maintained to prevent the slightest chance of rust.</p><h3>Do Damascus knives hold an edge better?</h3><p>It depends on what you're comparing them to, but in general, most premium blade steels like CPM S35VN will consistently hold a better edge for longer.</p><h3>How should I maintain my Damascus knife?</h3><p>If it is made using carbon or high carbon steels, you'll want to keep it clean, to prevent any dirt buildup from allowing moisture to collect and cause rust. By the same token, you'll also want to dry off the blade as soon as possible after being exposed to water, and wipe it down every other week or so with a thin layer of oil– more frequently, if you live in a humid environment. It's also best to not store it in its sheath, as moisture can collect in there, without much chance to evaporate. Stainless Damascus and Damasteel are vastly easier to maintain– just keep them clean and dry, and they'll be happy.</p><h3>Should I buy a cheap pattern-welded Damascus knife?</h3><p>Lol, no. I can't stress how much of a waste of money these are.</p>",275
23,dive watches under 500,,"<h2>FAQs on dive watches</h2><h3>How do I adjust the dive watch strap?</h3><p>It depends on the type of strap. For bracelets, you have to physically remove links to make large adjustments, and then use a diver's extension if you want to slip the watch over a wetsuit. For rubber or silicone straps, it can be as simple as buckling the strap like a belt, since that's often how those are secured. Aftermarket clasps can also be used which offer things like a ratcheting diver's extension, which allows for on-the-fly adjustment.</p><h3>How do I use a dive watch?</h3><p>To use a dive watch, find out how many minutes of air you have in your tank, and set the chevron of the dive bezel on the minute that you engage the regulator of your tank, allowing you to accurately measure how much time has elapsed.</p><h3>How and when do I wear a dive watch?</h3><p>Overall, dive watches are more sporty than dressy, and therefore fit more casual occasions where you don't need to worry about fitting one underneath a shirt cuff. However, James Bond has established the trend of wearing a Rolex Submariner or Omega Seamaster on more formal occasions, so these days it's a lot less strict. Additionally, you can find dive-style watches appointed in precious metals and with jewels, and so it's a personal preference these days.</p><h3>What watches do divers actually wear?</h3><p>Dive computers are the lifesaving device of choice these days since they can do so much more than a dive watch can in terms of metrics. However, Seiko, Omega, Sinn, and especially Rolex remain status symbols and nods to tradition and heritage among divers, and especially among military divers.</p>",274
3,throwing knives,,"<h2>FAQs on throwing knives</h2><h3>How much do throwing knives cost?</h3><p>A good quality throwing knife usually runs around $10 a pop, but since most purpose-built throwing knives come in sets of three or more, you can expect to drop somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 for a decent set.</p><h3>Can any knife be a throwing knife?</h3><p>Technically, yes. That said, if you want to hit your target with any degree of consistency or accuracy, skip the Bowie knife, the karambit, and any other knife that isn't built for throwing. Your knives will also last longer if you go with a purpose-built blade since traditional knives break more easily during high-speed impacts with solid objects.</p><h3>Which knife is best for throwing?</h3><p>If you plan to throw often, find throwing knives that are tough, lightweight enough for you, and have a good balance. Knives in the eight to 12-inch range are a great option, especially for beginners.</p><h3>What is a good distance for throwing knives?</h3><p>This depends on what kind of knife you are throwing, what size your knife is, and what technique you use (spin vs. no-spin techniques). In competitive knife throwing, standard distances are 10 and 15 feet. For newbies, though, a good distance usually ranges between eight and 15 feet, again, depending on your chosen knife and technique.</p><h3>Are throwing knives good for self defense?</h3><p>I don't care how feasible Hollywood makes it look, relying on a throwing knife to save your life is foolhardy. Even if you manage to stick your assailant in the perfect spot, he won't drop then and there since he's already amped up on adrenaline (or meth). That's bad news for you, especially if he's armed.</p>",272
170,hiking pants for men,,"<h2>FAQs on hiking pants for men</h2><h3>What's the best fabric for hiking pants?</h3><p>Your hiking pants should use fabric that's some combination of durable, lightweight, breathable, water-resistant, and wind-blocking. Wool, polyester, and nylon are our preferred fabrics.</p><h3>What features should hiking pants have?</h3><p>The best feature is quality construction. Look for lightweight, durable fabric that dries quickly. Beyond that, think about things like pockets, oversized belt loops, and the ability to zip off the bottom of your pants.</p><h3>Do I need hiking pants, outdoor pants, functional pants, or tactical pants?</h3><p>These terms are pretty vague and there's a lot of overlap. Plenty of people like to hike in tactical pants or wear hiking pants to work. Focus on the specific features you care about and don't worry about the label.</p><h3>What cut is best for hiking?</h3><p>Fit is a matter of personal preference, but most people prefer something with a little bit of extra room. Pants that fit loose in the legs tend to breathe better and rub less than tight-fitting pants. The exception to that rule is legging-style pants like base layers and some athletic pants.</p><h3>What insulation should my hiking pants have?</h3><p>There is a time and place for insulated hiking pants, but we usually recommend something that's three-season comfortable. Adding a base layer or outer layer to suit the weather is always an option and lets you get more use out of your clothing.</p><h3>Are compression pants good for hiking?</h3><p>Tight-fitting athletic pants can be worn for hikingInstagram has plenty of documentation to support that (although we're skeptical about how many miles some of those people actually cover). Whether or not you go that route is a matter of personal style.</p>",272
110,digital watches,,"<h2>FAQs about digital watches</h2><h3>What should I look for when buying a digital watch?</h3><p>When buying a digital watch, you should look for many of the same characteristics that you would when buying an analog watch. Things like legibility, durability, and ergonomics matter just as much here, but they take different forms, like the size of the numbers on the display, the backlight, and how easy it is to switch between the functions on these watches.</p><h3>What are the disadvantages of digital watches?</h3><p>One of the biggest disadvantages of digital watches has been that you can't view the time easily in low light without pressing a button, meaning it's one extra step to check the time in low light. This is extra concerning for SCUBA divers, who can't use the pushers on their watches underwater for fear of water infiltration. Some watches solve this by having a motion sensor that triggers the backlight when you flick your wrist.</p><h3>Are smartwatches and digital watches the same?</h3><p>Technically, smartwatches are just digital watches with improved computing power and connectivity, and some digital watches blur the line with things like Bluetooth, step counters, GPS chips, and other resources. However, colloquially, smartwatches refer to wrist-mounted devices that mimic the functions of a cellular device or computer, whereas digital watches usually refer to devices that are primarily for telling the time.</p><h3>What is better, a digital watch or a normal watch?</h3><p>Digital watches are easier to read precisely and quickly, down to the second, but analog watches are generally regarded as looking nicer, and certain roles like diver's watches require that the watch be analog to facilitate the use of a dive time bezel.</p>",271
186,coolers for camping,,"<h2>FAQs on coolers for camping</h2><h3>Why is bringing a cooler important?</h3><p>Coolers are your best bet for keeping drinks cool during the summer. They're also critical if you bring raw meat to cook at your campsite. Meat and dairy need to be refrigerated to prevent foodborne illness. We recommend throwing in a thermometer so you can monitor the interior temperature.</p><h3>What's the best way to fill a cooler?</h3><p>Pack your food and drinks first. It's not a bad idea to put packages of uncooked meat on the bottom, just in case they leak. Cold air is heavy, so pack ice on top of your food to get the most out of it. Don't skimp on the ice, either. Stack it as thick as you can.</p><h3>Should I drain the water from my cooler?</h3><p>This is a hotly contested debate, but we're with Adventure Journal on this onedon't do it. As long as the water is cooler than the ambient air, it's less of a problem than the air that will take its place when you drain it.</p><h3>How can I take care of my camping cooler?</h3><p>You obviously want to protect your cooler against impacts. In between uses, give it a thorough scrubbing with mild dish soap and warm water. That should be all it takes to keep your cooler fresh and ready for the next trip.</p><h3>Are camping coolers bear-proof?</h3><p>No. Cars aren't even bear-proof.</p><h3>How can I keep my cooler cold longer?</h3><p>Coolers do a great job of keeping their internal temperature low, but they can't actively lower it. To get the most out of your cooler, pack lots of ice and don't open the lid any longer than is necessary.</p>",271
195,water bottles,,"<h2>FAQs about water bottles</h2><h3>What is the healthiest water bottle to use?</h3><p>The healthiest water bottle is a clean one. If you're really concerned about contaminants in your water, a stainless steel bottle with a clean, high-quality filter is your best bet.</p><h3>Are stainless steel bottles better than plastic?</h3><p>Stainless steel water bottles are easier to clean and almost always more durable than plastic ones. They do tend to be heavier, though.</p><h3>How long do metal water bottles last?</h3><p> A stainless steel water bottle should last as long as you're willing to take care of it. They're extremely durable.</p><h3>Can you refrigerate stainless steel water bottles?</h3><p>Sure, just remember that insulated stainless steel water bottles will work against you if you're trying to cool your drink down by putting it in the fridge. In that case, use another container or leave the lid open.</p><h3>Can you boil water in a water bottle?</h3><p>Even though some plastic water bottles can hold boiling water, they shouldn't be exposed to heat long enough to bring it to a boil. Dual-walled stainless steel water bottles will act as a barrier to heat and may explode. Only single-walled stainless steel bottles are safe for boiling water.</p><h3>How often should you change your water bottle?</h3><p>Regular cleaning goes a long way, but even that can't keep some water bottles in good shape forever. A good sniff will tell you when it's time to say goodbye to your water bottle.</p><h3>Is it OK to put lemon in a stainless steel water bottle?</h3><p>Sure, live your dream. Stainless steel does a great job of storing various flavors without absorbing them and passing them on.</p>",263
206,foam rollers,,"<h2>FAQs about foam rollers</h2><h3>How much do foam rollers cost?</h3><p>You can buy a good, basic foam roller for $15 to $20, but these are typically going to be solid core, polypropylene rollers with not much to offer in the way of surface texture. If you're looking for a roller with some texture or a nice grid pattern, expect to pay between $30 and $45. Once you get above $45, you start to get into the foam rollers that offer extra features, such as vibration and collapsibility. These can range up over $100.</p><h3>Why does using foam rollers hurt?</h3><p>When you start using a foam roller, you should expect it to hurt. In order to work out the tension of your muscles, you are applying pressure in order to elongate that tissue and/or work out existing knots that can form during workouts. Have no fear, though, because it's supposed to hurt and the results are worth it. Prolonged pressure on muscle knots will cause them to release, and provide much-needed relief. Consistent use of your foam roller can help elongate muscles resulting in fewer injuries and less soreness.</p><h3>Can foam rolling be harmful?</h3><p>Yes, but only in the way that anything can be harmful if not used correctly. Before using a foam roller, you should try to identify the cause of any pain or injury you might have. Once identified, be reasonably sure that a foam roller could be a potential solution. You won't use a foam roller to treat a torn ACL or a herniated disk in your back. Be smart and consult a physician if you're unsure.</p>",263
84,ankle holsters,,"<h2>FAQs on ankle holsters</h2><h3>Are ankle holsters good for concealed carry?</h3><p>Generally, yes. Unless you wear shorts or trim/tight jeans all the time, an ankle holster can be a solid CCW holster option. Just make sure you practice your draw stroke (safely) as it is much less natural than drawing from the waistband.</p><h3>Are ankle holsters uncomfortable?</h3><p>Relative to not carrying at all, every CCW holster is uncomfortable, at least to some degree. With ankle holsters, the biggest detractors to comfort are sweat, especially with holsters sporting neoprene bands, and the extra weight at your ankle. Before wearing your holster in public, get used to the new feeling at home, and while you're at it, practice walking normally!</p><h3>Which leg do you wear an ankle holster on?</h3><p>With rare exceptions, the best place to position your ankle holster is on the inside leg of your non-dominant side. For a right-handed individual, this would be the inside of the left ankle. Also, consider rotating the firearm slightly forward to minimize the likelihood of kicking the firearm/holster while you walk.</p><h3>Can you open carry on your ankle?</h3><p>Even if open carry is legal in your state, then don't do it. You will have too little control over your firearm (especially around little people), and if you were to need it, you'd very likely get nailed before you could even touch it. Bad dudes don't care.</p><h3>Can you wear an ankle holster with boots?</h3><p>Yes, depending on the holster. Some holsters were designed specifically with boot wearers in mind while others were created for use by detectives, white-collar workers, and other bootless individuals.</p>",260

Just make sure you practice your draw stroke (safely) as it is much less natural than drawing from the waistband.</p><h3>Are ankle holsters uncomfortable?</h3><p>Relative to not carrying at all, every CCW holster is uncomfortable, at least to some degree. With ankle holsters, the biggest detractors to comfort are sweat, especially with holsters sporting neoprene bands, and the extra weight at your ankle. Before wearing your holster in public, get used to the new feeling at home, and while you're at it, practice walking normally!</p><h3>Which leg do you wear an ankle holster on?</h3><p>With rare exceptions, the best place to position your ankle holster is on the inside leg of your non-dominant side. For a right-handed individual, this would be the inside of the left ankle. Also, consider rotating the firearm slightly forward to minimize the likelihood of kicking the firearm/holster while you walk.</p><h3>Can you open carry on your ankle?</h3><p>Even if open carry is legal in your state, then don't do it. You will have too little control over your firearm (especially around little people), and if you were to need it, you'd very likely get nailed before you could even touch it. Bad dudes don't care.</p><h3>Can you wear an ankle holster with boots?</h3><p>Yes, depending on the holster. Some holsters were designed specifically with boot wearers in mind while others were created for use by detectives, white-collar workers, and other bootless individuals.</p>",260
267,holsters for sig p365,,"<h2>FAQs about SIG P365 holsters</h2><h3>What is the difference between the P365 and the P365 SAS?</h3><p>The SAS (SIG Anti-Snag) is a streamlined, no-snag version of the P365. Most notably, the front sight is completely absent, replaced with a fiber optic/tritium sight mounted flush in the rear of the slide. The goal is to prevent the gun from catching on anything during the draw. The downside is that the lack of a front sight reduces accuracy and, therefore, the effective range of the pistol.</p><h3>Can you ankle-carry a SIG P365?</h3><p>Yes, you can, and there are several ankle holsters available. Most ankle holsters are not pistol-specific, but rather they're made of leather or neoprene and are either one-size-fits-most or require you to order a specific holster size (but not specific to a particular pistol). See above for limitations of ankle holsters.</p><h3>Can you put a red dot on a SIG P365?</h3><p>Absotively! Wait - posolutely! SIG makes the P365 X and the P365 Romeo Zero. The X comes with a removable plate that reveals a red dot mounting location, and the Romeo Zero comes with the SIG red dot sight of the same name pre-installed.</p><h3>What is appendix carry?</h3><p>When you're appendix-carrying, you have an IWB holster positioned between roughly 11- and one-o'clock if 12 o'clock is your belly button. Appendix-carry boasts excellent concealability and a more natural draw stroke than strong-side carry, but most will agree that it is somewhat less comfortable as you're either getting poked in the family jewels or thigh by the muzzle, or your baby bump is rubbing on/getting violated by the grip.<br/>",260
209,sleeping bags,,"<h2>FAQs about sleeping bags</h2><h3>How do I wash a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Careful spot-cleaning is usually the best option. When you're done, hang the bag in a well-ventilated area even if you're confident it's completely dry. This is also the best way to store your sleeping bag.</p><h3>How much does a sleeping bag cost?</h3><p>As with anything, you get what you pay for. Some entry-level sleeping bags cost as little as $30. That's fine for sleeping indoors, but you'll want something warmer for outdoor camping. Some of our favorite sleeping bags cost between $200 and $300.</p><h3>How do I measure for a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Sleeping bags don't have a lot of variation in size, but it's important to find a good fit. The measurements provided by manufacturers refer to the sleeping bag itself, not the person it's intended for. Measure your height, chest, and hips, then give yourself some extra room.</p><h3>Can you put a sleeping bag in the dryer?</h3><p>Every sleeping bag will have its own care and handling instructions. Read them carefully to avoid damaging yours.</p><h3>How should I store my sleeping bag?</h3><p>If you visit your local outfitter, you'll see sleeping bags hanging in the open. That's not just for display; it's the best way to preserve the insulation. Hang your sleeping bag in the closet or in a loose, breathable bag rather than packing it away in its compression sack.</p><h3>What are sleeping bags made of?</h3><p>There are several layers to sleeping bags: a breathable inner layer, insulation, and a more durable exterior. Insulation can be down or synthetic, and the other layers typically use lightweight synthetic materials.</p>",259
259,handgun safes,,"<h2>FAQs on handgun safes</h2><h3>What is the most difficult gun safe to break into?</h3><p>There probably isn't a specific answer to this question, but there is a list of qualities. The most difficult gun safe to break into is one that's in a secure location, constructed from thick steel, and equipped with a dependable lock.</p><h3>Where should I put a pistol safe?</h3><p>There are two schools of thought here. School A is concerned about nefarious characters coming for them, and they say to put safes anywhere/everywhere that you might need a firearm. School B says to put them somewhere that isn't obvious, because if it isn't noticed, it's less likely to be stolen. For most people, finding a place in your bedroom that is easily accessible is ideal.</p><h3>Where should I keep my gun when I sleep?</h3><p>Keep it somewhere secure to prevent unauthorized access by children, guests, or intruders.</p><h3>Is it OK to keep a gun loaded?</h3><p>It depends. Legally speaking, the District of Columbia is the only place that has rules regarding unloading your firearms before storing them, but some states have laws that require you to lock up your firearms when they're not in use, according to the Giffords Law Center. Otherwise, most gun groups - pro- and anti- - recommend storing your guns unloaded, locked up, and away from ammo, and some groups suggest you develop a storage plan in case you want to access it in a self-defense scenario.</p><h3>What should I put in my gun safe?</h3><p>Your pistol, grandma's pearls, silver bullets, and anything else you want to limit access to.</p>",257

113,hydration bladders,,"<h2>FAQs on hydration bladders</h2><h3>How do I clean a hydration bladder?</h3><p>While each bladder may come with a different cleaning regime, you will generally rinse the tube out by filling the reservoir with a cleaning solution and then wash the reservoir out by scrubbing it with mild dish soap.</p><h3>How do I dry a hydration bladder?</h3><p>Disassemble all pieces of the bladder, and either hang the reservoir and tube or prop them upside down. You can also use a rag to dry out the inside of the reservoir, or turn it inside-out, if the model allows.</p><h3>How do I pack a hydration bladder?</h3><p>If a hydration bladder doesn't have any backbone that gives it structure, make sure to put it in your pack first, before anything else. If it does have a backbone, it doesn't matter as much when you pack it, since you can typically still squeeze it in full backpacking packs. Make sure to put the bladder in the sleeve that rests closest to your back for maximum comfort and accessibility.</p><h3>What size hydration bladder should I get?</h3><p>It depends on what activities you use. For easy day trips running, hiking or skiing, you shouldn't need more than two liters. But, if you plan to backpack in places with scarce water sources, bump up to three liters, at least.</p><h3>Can you freeze water in a hydration bladder?</h3><p>Yes, just don't fill it all the way, because ice expands and it could split open the plastic material. If you are looking to prevent your water from freezing, look towards insulated options, like the HydraPak HydraSleeve.</p>",256

135,power racks,,"<h2>FAQs on power racks</h2><h3>What's the difference between a squat rack and a power rack?</h3><p>These terms are frequently used interchangeably (e.g., don't curl in the squat rack). Technically, squat racks use an open, two-post design and power racks place the lifter in the middle of a four-post cage. For most people, both types of rack can be used effectively.</p><h3>What kind of exercises can I perform on a power rack?</h3><p>Power racks are designed to provide mechanical safety measures during the squat. The same safety and convenience are also great for the bench press, overhead press, rack pull, and pull-ups (so long as no one is waiting to actually squat).</p><h3>What are the must-have accessories to buy with a power rack?</h3><p>Most power racks come with everything you need. If not, you'll want to make sure you have safety bars or straps, hooks to hold the bar, and some way to store your plates in an organized way.</p><h3>Should I buy a bench for my power rack?</h3><p>If you're building a home gym, adding a bench to your power rack is a great investment. Most power racks feature holes specifically positioned to allow safety bars and J-hooks to be used for the bench press.</p><h3>Are power racks worth it?</h3><p>A power rack might be the best way to turn your home gym into a serious fitness facility. With a power rack, there are very few exercises you can't do. They aren't cheap, but the money you'll save on a gym membership will pay off the investment in no time.</p>",250

13,gun belts,,"<h2>FAQs on gun belts</h2><h3>What makes a good gun belt?</h3><p>A good gun belt should be rigid enough to support your equipment, while also being flexible enough to move with your body. It should also be stable when worn with an inner belt, to prevent the belt from moving when you go to draw a magazine. All gun belts on this list satisfy this need.</p><h3>What kind of gun belt should I get?</h3><p>Your gun belt should be scaled to your needs. If you're not someone who needs to carry more than three rifles magazines or a few items of gear on a vest, then you can possibly do without. If you're a law enforcement officer whose department requires you to wear all weapons and ammo on a belt, then a quality gunfighter belt is essential. The same goes for people who are in military occupations where they have to wear a pack with kidney straps, as with my Mystery Ranch Observed Fires Pack.</p><h3>Does a gun belt make a difference?</h3><p>A quality gun belt absolutely makes the difference between efficient gear carrying and more awkward options, whether they be carrying all your ammo and gear on a plate carrier or chest rig, or weaving holsters and ammo pouches directly into a conventional belt.</p><h3>Is a gun belt worth it?</h3><p>For those who need an easy-on and easy-off option to carry all of their essential gear, and that is separate from a plate carrier or chest rig, a quality gun belt is absolutely essential.</p>",246
255,climbing packs,,"<h2>FAQs on climbing backpacks</h2><h3>How do I know what size pack to get?</h3><p>There are two essential considerations on pack sizes. First, get a pack that fits your body (torso and waist measurements), and second, get a pack that's big enough to support the climbing you are going to do. It's useful to think of this in terms of days.</p><h3>Do I need ice axe and crampon retention systems?</h3><p>Yes, if you care about living and are going to move over snow and ice. If you're not moving over snow and ice (check the weather forecast), then you might consider a pack without them to save weight.</p><h3>Can I get away with just one pack?</h3><p>It depends. There's a lot of versatility in the 35- to 50-liter range of packs. If in doubt, go with the larger pack that has compression straps and a longer snow skirt that enables overstuffing. I've used one trusty 40-liter pack for years and it met most of my needs reliably.</p><h3>What's the best way to determine what size I need to fit my body?</h3><p>Check each manufacturer's specs for the torso length and hip belt dimensions. Most manufacturers make climbing packs in small/medium and medium/large sizes. The best thing is to try them on in the store with a load in the main storage chamber. Even better is to buy them online from a reputable retailer with a solid return policy, take them to a climbing gym, treat them carefully, and see how they perform on a wall.</p>",246
131,rooftop tents,,"<h2>FAQs on rooftop tents</h2><h3>What are the benefits of rooftop tents?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are popular because they're easy to set up in a short amount of time. They also get your sleeping area off the ground which adds a layer of protection against water and wildlife. The views aren't bad, either.</p><h3>What are the drawbacks of rooftop tents?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are more awkward to get in and out of because you have to climb a ladder. They also require you to keep your vehicle parked once they're up. Cost is another disadvantage compared to ground tents, but you may find that the pros outweigh the cons.</p><h3>Can I put a rooftop tent on my car?</h3><p>You bet! Rooftop tents are built to mount on roof racks, not the roof itself. As long as you have an adequate support structure, you can mount a rooftop tent to your car. As always, check with the manufacturer if you have any concerns.</p><h3>Why are rooftop tents so damn expensive?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are a lot more complicated to build than traditional tents. You also have to remember that they're in use all the time. Even when a rooftop tent is collapsed, it's still subjected to high speeds and the elements as long as it's on your vehicle.</p><h3>How sturdy are rooftop tents?</h3><p>Rooftop tents are tough by design. They're very compact when collapsed, and there isn't that much stress on them when they're popped up. The weak point could very well be the roof rack you mount them on.</p>",245

130,ultralight sleeping bags,,"<h2>FAQs about ultralight sleeping bags</h2><h3>How much should an ultralight sleeping bag weigh?</h3><p>I consider any bag under 25 ounces to be an ultra-lightweight sleeping bag.</p><h3>Is four pounds heavy for a sleeping bag?</h3><p>Yes. Four pounds is a lot for a sleeping bag. If you're car camping or just hiking a short distance, it might not matter much. Typically, bags weighing four pounds or more are roomier and more comfortable. If you're going to be hiking long distances over multiple days, you'll want the lightest bag you can afford. This is why I included the Mountain Hardwear Bishop Pass 30 as an option. At 28 ounces, it's a lightweight bag, but not a UL bag, but it compresses about as small as a UL bag and costs hundreds less.</p><h3>Should I get a 15- or 30-degree ultralight sleeping bag?</h3><p>It depends on how cold it will be where and when you are camping out. Typically, 30-degree bags are considered three-season (late spring, summer, and early fall) bags in most parts. If you are a cold sleeper, you might want a 20- or 15-degree bag. If you are looking to camp during the winter, you might opt for a four-season bag which might be a zero or negative-five-degree bag.</p><h3>Is goose down good for UL sleeping bags?</h3><p>Yes. Goose down is the preferred insulation for UL bags. Look for 800 power fill rated down or higher to get the most loft for the least weight. Note: It's also the most expensive down.</p>",244
202,ellipticals,,"<h2>FAQs on ellipticals</h2><h3>Should I go with a front drive or rear drive elliptical</h3><p>This depends on your workout goals. Front-drive machines tend to offer more of a ""stair-stepper"" motion and can be useful when training for uphill hikes and climbing. Rear-drive ellipticals tend to have a flatter, horizontal movement that mimics standard walks or runs.</p><h3>Should I buy an elliptical with a heavier flywheel?</h3><p>If you can, yes. The heavier the flywheel, the smoother and quieter the ride will be, but keep in mind, as the flywheel size increase, the price typically does too. Also, don't get too hung up on the flywheel. There are some quality machines out there that don't even use a flywheel.</p><h3>Why is stride length important?</h3><p>Stride length will determine how comfortable you are on the elliptical. If the stride length is too short, your experience will feel choppy and awkward. If it's too long, you may struggle and over-extend. Make sure you pick a stride length appropriate for your height.</p><h3>What is the best type of resistance system?</h3><p>The eddy current resistance system is the most common in higher-end machines. The eddy current resistance system works by moving an electromagnet closer or farther away from the flywheel to change the resistance respectively. Because it is controlled via electric current, there are fewer moving parts and therefore fewer opportunities for performance issues.</p><h3>What is an elliptical crosstrainer?</h3><p>Elliptical cross trainers are machines that have ergonomically moving arm handles that allow the user to get an upper-body workout also.</p>",244

213,air mattresses for camping,,"<h2>FAQs on air mattresses for camping</h2><h3>Why bother with a camping mattress?</h3><p>A good night of sleep will impact your mood, emotion regulation, and the recovery of your muscles, so investing in a high-quality mattress can make or break a camping trip. Your body and fellow campers will thank you for it.</p><h3>How do I choose a mattress for camping?</h3><p>You should consider the length of time and frequency you plan to use it as well as where and in what weather conditions. While you could probably get away with using plastic pool floaties for one night on a concrete tent pad, that isn't a practical solution for multi-day trips. If you are a thru- or long-distance hiker, you also want to consider weight, set up time, and packed size.</p><h3>What kinds of camping mattresses are there?</h3><p>Pool floaties aside, there are generally three types of camping mattresses: closed-cell, blow-up, and self-inflating. Each has its advantages when it comes to insulation, packed size, and overall comfort and ease of use. When, how often, and where you plan to camp should determine which type is best suited for your needs.</p><h3>How about the insulation aspect (R-value)?</h3><p>Simple answer. Don't skimp on the R-value if getting a good night's rest is important to you in the wilderness. Sleeping on a camping mattress with a high R-value won't make you feel hot, but it will provide a layer of protection between you and the cold ground, making for a much more comfortable night.</p>",242
17,gun oils,,"<h2>FAQs on gun oils</h2><h3>What gun oil does the U.S. military use?</h3><p>The U.S. military utilizes CLP. As an all-in-one oil, it's easy to store, transport, carry, and use.</p><h3>Should I oil the barrel of my gun?</h3><p>Yes. For optimal protection and performance, one should apply oil to the inside and outside of a barrel. Don't go overboard though, oil collects dirt when applied too heavily.</p><h3>What is the best gun oil to prevent rust?</h3><p>Any gun oil that is a protectant. Most CLPs work just fine. The biggest cause of rust is water though, so keep that gun dry.</p><h3>Can I use motor oil on my gun?</h3><p>No. You should avoid doing this. Motor oil is designed for cars and would work fine as a lubricant if shit hits the fan and you can't find gun oil, but it won't clean or protect your gun.</p><h3>Can I clean my gun with soap and water?</h3><p>Yes, but you need to understand the context before you do. You should use soap and water to remove corrosive chemicals (like after shooting some inexpensive Russian surplus ammo) or if you want to strip away the lubrication. However, you should immediately rinse and dry afterward, and then apply a light coat of lubrication to protect your firearm.</p><h3>Is WD-40 safe to use on guns?</h3><p>Yes, but I wouldn't rely on it.

In general, the greater the demand, the bigger the panel you'll need in terms of watts produced.</p><h3>What will a 200-watt solar panel cost?</h3><p>About $200 to $250 for most 200W panels.</p><h3>Are solar panels for camping worth it?</h3><p>Yes, especially if you are multi-day backpacking and want to cut weight.</p><h3>Can a solar panel run a camping fridge?</h3><p>Sure, if you get a big enough panel. You'll also probably need a power inverter, too.</p><h3>Is there a 500-watt solar panel?</h3><p>You betcha. See the 550W panel we reviewed for RVs.</p><h3>How much solar power do I need for a camper?</h3><p>It depends on what you need to charge. If you are backpacking and just need to charge a cell phone and smartwatch or GPS, you can probably get away with a 5- or 10-watt panel. If you are car camping at the KOA and want to power larger devices, you'll probably want a 50- to 200-watt panel depending on how much electronic junk you bring.</p><h3>How long does a portable solar panel last?</h3><p>This depends on the amount of abuse the panel takes. Generally speaking, panels are designed to last 20 to 30 years, but they degrade over time. The National Renewable Energy Lab found that, on average, solar panel output falls by 0.8 percent each year.</p>",239
79,shooting gloves,,"<h2>FAQs for shooting gloves</h2><h3>Can anyone use shooting gloves?</h3><p>Anyone can, and (in my opinion) should, use shooting gloves. No matter which glove you choose, having that added layer of protection will protect you from potential lacerations, burns, the elements, and,most importantly, lead poisoning. Besides, training with gloves on enables you to shoot well with them on or off, while training without doesn't.</p><h3>How tight should shooting gloves be?</h3><p>Most manufacturers publish a sizing guide to help you pick what size is right for you. Personally, I prefer my gloves tight enough where it moves with my hands (and not away from them), but not so tight to where blood circulation is getting cut off.</p><h3>Are shooting gloves easy to clean?</h3><p>It depends. If you're like me, those suckers go into the washing machine and then hang dry or sit out in the sun. If you are the type to care a little more about your gear, I recommend the gentler approach: hand-washing.</p><h3>Are shooting gloves worth it?</h3><p>Definitely! As a recent convert from the ""no glove gang,"" I have seen/endured enough pain in my hands to tell you that shooting gloves are worth every penny. Have you tried shooting barehanded in freezing rain? Extremely unpleasant.</p><h3>What shooting gloves does the military use?</h3><p>The U.S. military historically issued pretty unremarkable leather gloves, generally speaking.

39,car gun safes,,"<h2>FAQs on car gun safes</h2><h3>Can you keep a gun in a glove box?</h3><p>From a safety standpoint, most experts do NOT recommend storing a gun in the glove box, especially if it's not a locking glove box. From a legal standpoint, the country is divided on the issue. However, in most states, you can conceal a firearm in your glove box if you are permitted to concealed carry.</p><h3>What size should my vehicle gun safe be?</h3><p>That is completely up to your specific use case. Look at one that will fit your firearm(s). How many mags will you carry? Does it have large accessories? Then check where you intend to store it. Find a safe with the right dimensions for that spot.</p><h3>What's the safest way to transport a firearm in a vehicle?</h3><p>Unless you're specifically (and legally) keeping it in your car for defense purposes, it shouldn't be loaded and hot. Keep it locked up in a hard case and away from where passengers or thieves could tamper with it. It should be unloaded with ammo stored away from the gun.</p><h3>What is the difference between a car gun safe and a console safe?</h3><p>A car gun safe encompasses most lockable storage solutions whereas console vaults/safes specifically refer to fixed storage within a vehicle's center console. When installed, it will replace or take up a good chunk of the original space with a safe that's integrated with the car and out of sight.<br/>",237
61,spotting scope tripods,,"<h2>FAQs about spotting scope tripods</h2><h3>Will any tripod work with a spotting scope?</h3><p>Yes, although an adapter may be required to mate the scope to the top attachment of the tripod based on the thread pitch of the stud. We recommend purchasing a quick-release locking plate of a type compatible with the top attachment of the tripod.</p><h3>Can you hold a spotting scope?</h3><p>No. Even though spotting scopes are variable power, the minimum magnification level is generally above 10x which is far too high to hold steady without external support.</p><h3>How do spotting scopes attach to tripods?</h3><p>While it's generally possible to screw the spotting scope directly to the top attachment stud of a tripod, the preferred method is to use a quick-release locking plate. The plate consists of two parts, one which is permanently mounted to the tripod and the other to the base of the scope.</p><h3>Can you use binoculars as a spotting scope?</h3><p>No. Most binoculars have a smaller objective lens and considerably less magnification than a spotting scope and lack a reticle. The purpose of binoculars is to scan for potential targets, then use the spotting scope to zoom in on the target of interest.</p><h3>Are spotting scope mounts universal?</h3><p>No. You should check and make sure that the stud size and thread pitch between your spotting scope and tripod match. If you intend to purchase a quick-release locking plate, it should be of the type that is supported by your tripod's manufacturer.</p>",237
72,closet gun safes,,"<h2>FAQs about closet gun safes</h2><h3>Will a gun safe damage carpeting in my closet?</h3><p>Yes. Over time, heavy objects will cause indentations and flatten the carpet on which they stand. However, things like vacuuming and steaming the carpet, or even placing an ice cube on the carpet, can lift up the crushed fibers and help restore the carpet towards its original state.</p><h3>Is the closet a good place to put a gun safe?</h3><p>A closet is an excellent place for a gun safe, especially for those living in smaller homes where floor space is at a premium. Placing a safe in a closet keeps the safe out of sight, keeping your firearms or valuables relatively easy to access, while not giving up space in other parts of the home.</p><h3>What size of gun safe is suitable for my firearm?</h3><p>That is dependent on the type of firearm. Shotguns and hunting rifles are longer than AR-15s and require a taller gun safe, while pistols can fit into safes that are far smaller.</p><h3>Do gun safes need to be climate-controlled?</h3><p>That depends. If the location where the safe is kept is climate-controlled, the safe will maintain a similar temperature. However, if you live in a location that sees high humidity, then it may present a rusting issue. To combat this, safes may be modified so that power can be run inside the safe. From there, a small dehumidifier can be installed to help prevent mold and rust.</p>",237
48,rucking backpacks,,"<h2>FAQs about rucking backpacks</h2><h3>Do you need a special backpack for rucking?</h3><p>Not at all. You choose what works best for you when rucking.</p><h3>Does rucking build back muscle?</h3><p>Yes, and shoulder muscle as well.</p><h3>How much weight can you ruck with?</h3><p>Depending on the quality of the pack and type of frame, your ability to carry and move with the weight, you may find your answer. In the military, it is typical to carry anywhere from 55 to 80 pounds of gear depending on the mission or training outcome.</p><h3>What should I look for in a ruck pack?</h3><p>Look for high-quality material that can withstand stress, weight, and wear, along with reinforced stitching and heavily padded shoulder straps. A waist belt and compression straps are important, not to mention a frame (internal or otherwise) that can help immensely in carrying heavy loads without hurting your back.</p><h3>What's the difference between a rucksack and backpack?</h3><p>Rucksacks are typically designed for heavier loads with the hiker or military member in mind. Backpacks can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and purposes.</p><h3>What rucksack does the military use?</h3><p>Most of the Army use the modular lightweight load-carrying equipment MOLLE II packs. The Marine Corps uses a similar version called the Improved Load-Bearing Equipment, or ILBE.</p><h3>What are the benefits of rucking?</h3><p>With a heavy load on your body and walking at a brisk pace, you pick up a cardio-like exercise. It helps build strength in your legs, back, and shoulders.</p>",235
140,utility knives,,"<h2>FAQs on utility knives</h2><h3>How do you use a utility knife?</h3><p>Carefully. No, really. All the normal basic safety rules for working with a sharp tool apply. Never cut towards yourself or your hand, always cut away from you. Never cut when anyone is within your reach with the knife extended: It's colloquially known as the blood circle for a reason.</p><h3>Can a utility knife cut wood?</h3><p>While almost any knife that isn't dull can cut wood, there are knives specifically designed for cutting and carving wood that will do it much better than, say, a box-cutter. The Japanese Kiridashi is a great example of a knife specifically designed for this.</p><h3>How should I maintain my utility knife?</h3><p>That depends on a couple of factors, including steel type, intended use, environment, and whether it is a folder or fixed-blade. If it's made using high carbon steel, you'll want to keep it clean and dry to prevent any dirt buildup from allowing moisture to collect and cause rust. You'll also want to dry off the blade as soon as possible after being exposed to water, and wipe it down every other week or so with a thin layer of oil - more frequently if you live in a humid or salty environment. Modern stainless steels require drastically less maintenance in comparison, but you'll still want to keep them clean and dry, and lightly oil them occasionally if you're in a marine environment.</p>",235
5,concealed carry holsters for women,,"<h2>FAQs about concealed carry holsters</h2><h3>Is it hard to conceal-carry a larger gun?</h3><p>As long as a good holster is selected and it is worn with a proper cover garment, concealing a larger or full-size gun can be done even by small-framed people.</p><h3>What's the deal with ankle carry?</h3><p>Ankle carry can be useful when using a gun with a short grip such as a Glock 26 or a small revolver, but is not as common these days.</p><h3>What options are there for plus-sized bodies?</h3><p>The PHLster Enigma can be a great option as long as the waist strap and leg leash fit. Holsters that are designed to be carried in the three- to five-o'clock position can also be more comfortable than appendix carry.</p><h3>Are belly bands or thigh holsters any good?</h3><p>Generally speaking, no. These types of holsters tend to be made out of a flexible fabric that doesn't offer any sort of protection for the trigger.</p><h3>I don't want to carry on my body, so can I keep my gun in my purse?</h3><p>It depends. It can be difficult to draw a pistol from most off-the-shelf purses, but there are several companies making purses and bags designed with a pocket or pockets meant to hold a firearm. Either way, the other concern is retaining control of the purse and, in turn, your pistol. As is the case with any style of concealed carry, off-body carry is something you'll have to train for.</p>",234
7,self defense keychains,,"<h2>FAQs about self-defense keychains</h2><h3>How much do self-defense keychains cost?</h3><p>Thankfully, these items are defensive tools that won't break the bank in the manner a firearm or quality standard-length blade would. Nearly all defensive keychains sell between $10 and $20, with multi-item bundle deals being sold from $20 to $30. Our Best Value-winning Sabre Pepper Spray stickers for an inviting $10.</p><h3>Are self-defense keychains legal everywhere?</h3><p>It depends on the method of defense and location. Kubotans are generally legal in all U.S. states, but some jurisdictions may pose minor restrictions. Spiked kubotans are illegal in the U.K., with blunt variants still hotly debated. And they're too short to be legal in Canada. Knives will fall under the same restrictions as other blades, just as plastic knuckle dusters are bunched in with brass knuckles.</p><h3>Can I take self-defense keychains on a plane?</h3><p>Just about all defensive keychains will face the same travel restrictions on planes, meaning knives and kubotans are often barred from carry-ons and can only be checked in. Pepper spray containers up to four ounces may also be checked in. Stun guns and tasers must be rendered inoperable.</p><h3>How effective are self-defense keychains?</h3><p>Like any weapon in the hand of a well-versed individual, any defense tool, no matter how small or simple, can be used as a brutal force multiplier. Even basic and polarizing devices such as kubotans can deliver painful jabs to pressure points and fleshy areas, greatly discouraging attackers.</p>",234
143,tactical wallets,,"<h2>FAQs about tactical wallets</h2><h3>How much do tactical wallets cost?</h3><p>Price greatly varies as materials, functionality, and quality improve, but they'll generally cost more than most basic wallets. Entry models can be had for between $25 and $40. Higher-tier variants start at $70 to $80 and rapidly escalate into the hundreds. Specialized models with extra tools or carbon and titanium construction can easily eclipse $200 to $300. Our Best Value-winner starts at a friendly $21.</p><h3>What is ""RFID"" in wallets?</h3><p>RFID refers to ""Radio-Frequency IDentification."" For those genuinely interested, ensure the wallet that you're keen on purchasing shields against RFID. Many tactical wallets with hardened, metallic construction are usually RFID-proofed and can shield you from the admittedly unlikely occurrence of hackers scanning for credit cards or ID information.</p><h3>Are tactical wallets actually necessary?</h3><p>That depends on who you ask. It can be needless excess and a gimmicky flex to the average person. To those with active lifestyles who partake in strenuous trade jobs, extreme sports, or ahem, the military, tactical wallets will give them added protection, durability, and weatherproofing for all their valuables.</p><h3>What advantages do tactical wallets have over standard wallets?</h3><p>The overarching advantage that tactical wallets have is some degree of elevated functionality. Some offer far more generous storage than their less specialized kin, while others sacrifice a bit of space for easier carrying of the bare essentials. Many feature toughened construction with metal frames, casings, and even integrated multitools.</p>",234
184,survival backpacks,,"<h2>FAQs about survival backpacks</h2><h3>Is there a difference between a survival backpack and a bug-out backpack?</h3><p>Yes and no; the backpacks themselves can be identical. The contents inside are what differentiate a survival backpack from a bug-out backpack, although to the untrained individual, the differences may be almost indistinguishable.</p><h3>What should you always carry in a survival pack?</h3><p>Your survival backpack loadout will depend on your specific environment and situation. That said, all survival packs should include tools for a water filter or purifier, fire starters, shelter (skip the tent), medical care, comms, essential tools (including nav gear, like a map and compass), illumination, hygiene essentials (primarily baby wipes), food, and clothing essentials (mainly a skivvy roll and weather protection).</p><h3>How much weight can a survival backpack hold?</h3><p>Backpack weight capacities vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, although higher-end packs can handle up to 35 pounds. Your loadout (including the pack) should weigh no more than 20 percent of your body weight, so look for a pack that can handle slightly more than that.</p><h3>How long will a survival backpack last?</h3><p>A survival backpack's lifespan will depend heavily on many factors. A lightly loaded pack that never gets used could last indefinitely, while an overloaded pack that gets thrown around on a regular basis likely won't last more than a year or two. Of course, build quality also plays into the equation, so predictably, higher quality will last longer than a cheaper one.</p>",234
2,karambit knives,,"<h2>FAQs on karambit knives</h2><h3>Is it illegal to carry a karambit?</h3><p>Karambits are legal in most states, but it depends on your state's knife laws and local restrictions. Laws that limit your blade length or ban carrying fixed-blades concealed can severely limit your options. To check out your state's knife laws, click here.</p><h3>How dangerous are karambits?</h3><p>As dangerous as any other knife. Without proper self-defense training though, karambits become less dangerous to assailants and more dangerous to the user.</p><h3>Is a karambit used for self-defense or utility purposes?</h3><p>While the karambit is primarily designed for self-defense, it can still be used for many utility tasks. Some karambit models are designed primarily for self-defense, others for utility, and some as a happy medium between the two.</p><h3>I think karambits are cool, especially for doing tricks with. Should I get one?</h3><p>No. Spinning a karambit around your finger might look cool, but it serves no practical use, and you risk accidentally cutting yourself. There are a lot of important nerves, tendons, and blood vessels in your hands and forearms that are at risk if you play with your karambit. Karambits are tools, not toys.</p><h3>Are karambits good for self-defense?</h3><p>The short answer is no. The long answer is that successfully using a karambit for self-defense requires training, and a lot of it, so we'd heavily advise against getting one for self-defense unless you're willing to put in the time and effort to become proficient.</p>",233
198,hiking poles,,"<h2>FAQs on hiking poles</h2><h3>How do I use hiking poles?</h3><p>First, you need to decide whether you want one or two poles. Most people choose two. Next, you need to make sure you get the right length. Look for poles that allow your elbow to bend at 90 degrees when the pole tips are on the ground. There's also a technique for using the poles. Alternate hands and legs while moving and keep the tips behind the handles to help push you forward.</p><h3>Are hiking poles worth it?</h3><p>Hell, yes. I used to pooh pooh them, but once I tried them, I was sold and have used them for six years now. I won't go hiking without them because I feel much more stable and efficient when moving over rough terrain, especially when carrying a heavy pack.</p><h3>Why use hiking poles?</h3><p>Safety and efficiency. The further you go from the trailhead, the more self-reliant you need to be. Trekking poles help keep you upright and assist in preventing you from crashing and injuring yourself. Mine have saved me from twisted ankles, broken bones, and expensive dental repair work. Also, they add your arms into the propulsion system and help you move faster and more confidently over rough terrain.</p><h3>Can you take hiking poles on a plane?</h3><p>Yep. If you are going to travel, consider using Z style poles that fold up into packages about 15 inches in length or smaller.</p>",232

I've seen quality sunglasses range from $25 to $50 for value glasses, $50 to $100 for mid-range glasses, and $100 and up for premium shades. If you have $470 to burn, Oakley will sell you a pair of Zeus.</p><h3>Why are there so many lens colors?</h3><p>Different lenses filter out different light in different amounts and affect how much contrast and what colors you see. Gray, green, and brown lenses are normally used for outdoor activities to cut glare and reduce eye fatigue. Gray and green typically don't distort color. Yellow and vermillion lenses are designed for use in low-light conditions and enhance contrast. This can be important when you are skiing or snowboarding, as they improve the visibility of objects in the landscape.</p><h3>What are sunglass lenses made of?</h3><p>Most are made from either polycarbonate or glass. Polycarbonate is lighter than glass, provides better impact protection, and delivers great clarity, but scratches more easily. Glass is heavier and resists scratches better. It's also more expensive.</p><h3>What about lens coatings?</h3><p>Sunglasses often come with one or more chemically-applied coatings to make them tougher to scratch, less likely to fog up, repel water, or mirrored to reflect more sunlight and reduce glare.</p>",228

Check your local laws regarding butterfly knives. Details on legality in different states can be found here.</p><h3>What is a good size for a butterfly knife?</h3><p>It depends on your use case. Most butterfly knives tend to range between three to over 4.5 inches. Larger knives (four inches and up) can be legitimately effective tools for defense or serious cutting. Smaller blades tend to be easier to conceal and have better weight balance for easier, faster flipping during tricks. This is highly subjective, however, as some prefer the momentum afforded by heavier knives to help move the blade.</p><h3>How old do you have to be to get a trainer butterfly knife?</h3><p>As they're not real knives with a sharpened edge, you can purchase a trainer butterfly knife at pretty much any age in most places. Some owners of trainers on the internet are noted to be as young as 12 years old, with parents in forums expressing interest in trainers for children even younger.

Combat boots are designed solely for military use, while tactical boots cater to first responders and government contractors as well as military service members.</p><h3>Can you run in tactical boots?</h3><p>Yes, although you won't be setting any records in the process. As such, we do recommend buying a dedicated pair of running boots for your combat fitness test or the obstacle course. Just remember that they won't hold up in the field, so save them for the proper time.</p><h3>How do you break in tactical boots?</h3><p>The fastest way to break in a new pair of boots is the wet method. This entails thoroughly soaking the boots inside and out, wearing them all day with two or three pairs of socks on (leather shrinks as it dries), then removing the insoles and letting both those and the boots dry.</p><h3>How tight should tactical boots be?</h3><p>A good pair of boots should fit nice and snug but should not be constricting. The Marine Corps recommends trying on a new pair of boots in the evening while wearing the socks you plan to wear with the boots. Make sure your toes have wiggle room (0.5 inches between your toes and the end of the boot) and that your heel doesn't lift more than 0.25 inches when you walk.</p>",225
32,hunting boots,,"<h2>FAQs about hunting boots</h2><h3>What's the difference between hunting boots and hiking boots?</h3><p>Hiking boots are lightweight footwear designed to withstand long treks over rough terrain. While some hunting boots fall into a similar category, others are designed to keep a hunter's feet warm while he or she sits for hours on end in cold and/or wet conditions waiting for game to arrive.</p><h3>How tall should my hunting boots be?</h3><p>It depends on what kind of hunting you plan to do. Duck hunters will want very tall boots while wading through ponds, marshes, or rivers. While backcountry big game hunters won't need knee-high boots, proper boots will provide plenty of ankle support to help transport heavy loads across rough terrain.</p><h3>How long should hunting boots last?</h3><p>If you prefer backcountry elk mountains high in the rough Rockies, your boots may last anywhere between half a season to two years even if they're high-end boots. With proper care and lighter use, one or two seasons could stretch to five years for a quality pair of hunting boots.</p><h3>Are expensive hunting boots worth it?</h3><p>If you hunt hard, fast, and often, then definitely plan to drop a few hundred bucks on a high-quality pair of boots. If, however, you only go on occasional non-backcountry hunts, you likely can go with a more budget-conscious boot. That said, never skimp on quality; skip the cheap stuff.</p>",224
65,punching bags,,"<h2>FAQs on punching bags</h2><h3>Which material is best for punching bags?</h3><p>Mechanically compressed textiles resist moisture and implement an even design for solid punches. It resists anchoring and hardening over time.</p><h3>What punching bags do professionals use?</h3><p>Professional fighters use a variety of bags like heavy bags, double-end bags, speed bags, power punch bags, and the specific brand they use varies depending on where they train. Some fighters use whatever bags their gym carries or use bags provided by a sponsor.</p><h3>Are gloves necessary for punching bags?</h3><p>Yes. You should wear gloves or some kind of protection if you plan on striking a bag for exercise. If you don't, you risk damaging or injuring your hands or wrists.</p><h3>Can you kick a punching bag?</h3><p>Yes, you can kick a punching bag, but know that some heavy bags are specifically designed for kicking, so the best practice is to understand how to use your equipment before doing something you're unsure about.</p><h3>Do punching bags build muscle?</h3><p>Not really. A punching bag will help you tone muscle in addition to giving you a cardiovascular workout, but it won't help you build muscle like, say, weightlifting.</p><h3>Are MMA gloves good for punching bags?</h3><p>Yes, but you should understand your equipment before doing something you're unsure about. Boxing gloves typically offer more padding and protection for your hands and wrists than MMA gloves, which are designed for grappling as well.</p>",224

45,under bed gun safes,,"<h2>FAQs on under-bed gun safes</h2><h3>What's the point of putting a gun safe under your bed?</h3><p>Two main reasons. First, since long guns do not fit inside bedside gun safes, it pays to keep one handy with an under-bed gun safe instead. And second, if you have a very small arsenal or limited storage options, a floor-mounted under-bed safe may be your best bet.</p><h3>Is it better to bolt my safe to the floor or to the bed?</h3><p>The floor. Your bed frame can be disassembled or hacked to pieces much more easily than your floor can. Plus, floor-mounted safes do a top-notch job of protecting their anchoring hardware as compared to bed-mounted safes.</p><h3>What can I put in my gun safe to absorb moisture?</h3><p>Depending on your safe, consider purchasing either a safe dehumidifier or a desiccant moisture absorber. Dehumidifiers require electricity, thus wiring options are a critical consideration. Desiccant containers do not require electricity but must be ""recharged"" in an oven once they get ""full.""</p><h3>Are under-bed gun safes fireproof?</h3><p>It depends on the safe; however, most under-bed gun safes fail to provide adequate protection against fire, heat, and water damage.</p><h3>How long do I need to train my biometric fingerprint?</h3><p>It depends on the fingerprint reader in question. That said, we usually recommend avoiding electronic locking mechanisms in safes that might require quick access in the middle of the night.</p>",223

Some arrive almost fully assembled, while some require more in-depth assembly. However, it's pretty common for your treadmill to need just a few screws to come together once it's delivered.</p><h3>Do foldable treadmills have inclines?</h3><p>Yes, most folding treadmills offer inclines. A 10 percent incline is the average, but some can offer more of a steep grade.</p><h3>Are folding treadmills safe and stable?</h3><p>In general, folding treadmills are perfectly safe to use and stable while in use. However, you'll want to make sure you choose one that's suitable for your weight and is made by a reputable brand. That's the best way to determine how secure your treadmill will be.</p><h3>Can you put a folding treadmill on the carpet?</h3><p>You can definitely use a folding treadmill on the carpet - just make sure you put a non-slip treadmill mat underneath its feet first. These mats are designed to offer increased grip and prevent potentially dangerous or damaging movement on soft surfaces.</p><h3>Are folding treadmills worth it?</h3><p>If you're working with limited available space or simply don't want a treadmill to take up permanent space in your home or garage, a folding treadmill is absolutely worth investing in.

60,hunting knives,,"<h2>FAQs on hunting knives</h2><h3>What should I expect to pay for a good hunting knife?</h3><p>""Good"" is a subjective term, but we recommend starting your search around the $100 mark. That's where you'll start to see better types of steel and manufacturing practices. The sky's the limit, but our picks fall between $100 and $300.</p><h3>What makes a good hunting knife?</h3><p>A good hunting knife is one that can get the job done and make your life easier. That might mean a precise blade that can delicately dress a dove in the field or a bushcraft knife that can just as easily break down an elk as split firewood. Buy what works for you, not someone else.</p><h3>How long should a hunting knife's blade be?</h3><p>A lot of knife reviewers seem to adhere to the Crocodile Dundee school of thought when it comes to hunting knives. There are times when making careful cuts with something small is more appropriate. We chose blades ranging from less than three inches up to five inches for this guide.</p><h3>Can I use a folding knife for hunting?</h3><p>You sure can. Some of our favorite folding knives are made for hunting. Assuming size isn't an issue, the main drawback is the amount of cleaning that's required afterward. We'd rather not disassemble a folding knife to get it clean if we don't have to.</p>",220
75,compasses,,"<h2>FAQs on compasses</h2><p>Historians believe the magnetic navigational compass was invented by the Chinese, possibly as early as the 11th or 12th century. Pre-navigational compasses were invented during the Han Dynasty sometime between the 2nd century BCE and the 1st century CE.</p><p>Two good squad leaders: a jaded corporal, and a platoon sergeant.</p><p>The very best accessory you can have for your compass is a map. Without a map, your compass isn't useless, per se, but you're extremely limited in your ability to navigate beyond a panic azimuth. Other good accessories are a case of some sort to keep it from getting damaged or beat up. and maybe a length of paracord for a tie-down.</p><p>The military typically uses lensatic compasses, which are more durable and rugged than most. Since 1992, the contract for all military compasses has been with Cammenga, whose lensatic compass we named as our pick for Most Durable.</p><p>The most important thing is to assess your needs. Are you teaching your child orienteering as a family weekend activity, or are you solo trekking across the Pacific Northwest? After that, factor in your budget and your skill level - both your current level and the level you wish to achieve. Make sure your compass has a few basics, such as good luminous markings, a solidly fluid encased magnetic needle, and readable markings.</p>",220
15,rangefinders for hunting,,"<h2>FAQs about rangefinders for hunting</h2><h3>What is the easiest rangefinder to use?</h3><p>The AOFAR HX-700N is probably the easiest rangefinder to use, simply because it has the fewest fancy features. That being said, many rangefinder manufacturers have put a lot of time and effort into simplifying their user interface to lower the chances of complications in the field.</p><h3>Do you need a slope on a rangefinder?</h3><p>It depends on your terrain. If you plan to hunt from an elevated position or you're roving through mountainous terrain, you'll probably want to have a rangefinder that accounts for slope and calculates your distance using Angle Compensation.</p><h3>How long do laser rangefinders last?</h3><p>Like anything, the better you care for it, the longer it will last. That said, when I asked Google this same question, the most common answer was about five years, but this probably has a lot to do with the frequency of use as well.</p><h3>How do you bow hunt without a rangefinder?</h3><p>Some bowhunters, especially treestand hunters, circumvent the need for rangefinders by pre-marking range distances within their field of fire. This can be done by measuring the distance from the base of your tree to prominent features (like trees, rocks, fences, etc.) in the surrounding area. Having these known distances to key features can help a bowhunter estimate their target's distance by means of comparison.</p>",219
51,cross draw holsters,,"<h2>FAQs about cross-draw holsters</h2><h3>What are the advantages of a cross-draw holster?</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages to a cross-draw holster is the ease of access to your firearm while seated. OWB variants of this holster have the added advantage of handling larger or long-barreled handguns much better than most other concealed carry holsters, provided you wear a cover garment with it.</p><h3>Is cross-draw slower?</h3><p>It depends. When sitting, a cross draw may just be the fastest option available, but while standing or walking, there might be a couple of faster options, depending on cover garments and muscle memory. No matter what, practice is key.</p><h3>What side do you wear a cross-draw holster?</h3><p>Cross-draw holsters are designed to be worn on your weak or support side. This means that righties will position their holster on their left hip, while lefties will do the opposite.</p><h3>What is the most comfortable way to conceal carry?</h3><p>This depends heavily on your physique and lifestyle. People who sit most of the time might prefer an ankle holster, cross-draw, or shoulder holster, while those who stand or walk a lot might prefer an IWB option instead.</p><h3>What is your strong-side hip?</h3><p>Your strong-side hip is the hip closest to your dominant hand.

They'll likely be freeze-dried for a long shelf life.</p><h3>How do you store survival food?</h3><p>Some companies advertise that their freeze-dried foods can be taken anywhere including in cars, offices, and campers for whenever you might need them. A good rule of thumb to follow for any type is to simply keep them somewhere dry and cool - at or below 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h3>What foods have the longest shelf life?</h3><p>Anything freeze-dried will greatly exceed other methods of preservation by leaps and bounds. Most survival food kits sold in bulk will be freeze-dried and capable of lasting for as long as three decades.

128,cycling gloves,,"<h2>FAQs on cycling gloves</h2><h3>Are gloves necessary for road cycling?</h3><p>No, but if you don't have them, you'll soon wish you did, as sweat and vibration will make longer rides far less pleasant.</p><h3>Do you need cycling gloves in the summer?</h3><p>Yes, not just because of the reasons stated above, but also to protect your hands in the event of a wreck or fall.</p><h3>What should I look for in cycling gloves?</h3><p>Comfortable fit, with little bunching in the palm. I recommend modestly padded ones unless you're mountain bike riding. In that case, extra padding is great.</p><h3>Should cycling gloves feel tight or loose?</h3><p>Snug is the right fit. You want gloves that conform to your hand without constricting it, to allow unimpeded use of your gears and brakes.</p><h3>Why does my hand go numb when cycling?</h3><p>Pressure on the median and ulnar nerves. This is often brought on by vibration (which can be offset with good gloves), a poor bike fit, or inappropriate posture. Check out the linked article for tips on reducing numbness.</p><h3>Do I need half-finger or full-finger gloves?</h3><p>It's weather-dependent. Full-finger gloves are great for colder weather, and some prefer them for mountain bike riding (although I like fingerless unless it's cold out).</p><h3>Do I need a nose wipe?</h3><p>Yes, if you have outdoor allergies.

168,dumbbell sets,,"<h2>FAQs on dumbbell sets</h2><h3>Why are they called ""dumbbells?""</h3><p>One theory suggests that the English poet Joseph Addison unintentionally created the name when referring to the church bells he used to work out. Since he'd removed the clappers to silence them, he referred to them as ""dumb"" bells. This seems to be the most probable origin, but we may never know the real reason.</p><h3>What range of weights do people normally use with dumbbells?</h3><p>This is going to be highly subjective depending on spatial needs and fitness goals. That being said, most lifters can effectively utilize dumbbells from 10 to 40 pounds for their goals.</p><h3>Should I buy adjustable dumbbells or fixed dumbbells?</h3><p>Once again, this is highly subjective. If you're tight on space, you might benefit from adjustable dumbbells. But if space is no concern and you want the widest range possible, fixed dumbbells are the way to go because you don't have to mess with dials or plates.</p><h3>Is unilateral training easier with dumbbells?</h3><p>Yes. Dumbbells allow you to focus on specific muscle groups and sections of the body. This is really beneficial if there is a large symmetrical discrepancy in performance between sides. If you can curl 50 pounds with your left arm but only 25 pounds with the right, you can tailor your workouts to improve onside and decrease the discrepancy.</p>",217

30,free standing punching bags,,"<h2>FAQs on free-standing punching bags</h2><h3>How heavy should a free-standing punching bag be?</h3><p>Free-standing punching bags will have a base weight somewhere between 200 and 400 pounds. Stronger individuals who practice high-power strikes, especially kicks, will want more ballast in their bag's base. On the flip side, a smaller, lighter individual focusing on speed and lighter-power strikes can get away with something lighter.</p><h3>Why should I buy a free-standing punching bag over a hanging bag?</h3><p>If you need a punching bag that can be easily moved from place to place and/or can accommodate a wide variety of strike types, then go with the free-standing punching bag.</p><h3>Should I fill my free-standing punching bag with water or sand?</h3><p>As a general rule, use water if you expect to fill and empty your punching bag's base on any sort of frequent basis.

A portable safe is best for a combination of pistols, ammunition, and/or valuable documents. As always, it depends on your collection of guns.</p><h3>What is the delivery method for a gun safe?</h3><p>Whether you buy it online or in person, you'll almost never get your safe the same day. Typically, the vendor will schedule a delivery using a truck with a lift gate. Often, the sale includes verbiage about how far and where they will install the safe in your home. A garage or other space on the ground level with no slope is often included in the price, while extra fees will be charged for difficult-to-access locations (like a basement). Once in place, they'll usually bolt the safe into the ground using concrete anchor screws through prefabricated slots in the bottom of the safe cabinet.</p><h3>Is a dehumidifier necessary?</h3><p>Yes, if you want to avoid rust and corrosion. Older, antique guns are particularly vulnerable to this. However, dehumidification doesn't have to be expensive. It can be as simple as buying a $15 refillable desiccant dehumidifier and putting it on the shelf in your safe.</p>",214

In a nutshell, it's periods of high-intensity exertion separated by moderate-intensity ""recovery periods"" and repeated to the point of exhaustion. This is accomplished on treadmills through speed changes and incline changes throughout the workout.</p><h3>How do I move a treadmill?</h3><p>Some of the treadmills on our list are light enough to pick up and carry once folded. For those that don't fold, many come with base-mounted wheels, so it's just a matter of tipping up the machine and wheeling it around your workout space.</p><h3>How do I run on a treadmill?</h3><p>The same way you'd do it on the ground: [lace one foot in front of the other, but faster than if you were walking.</p><h3>Why were treadmills invented?</h3><p>Treadmills were invented 200 years ago in England and were originally used as ""rehabilitation devices"" in prisons, meaning they were made to make people suffer for their bad behavior. In a way, that's what we still use them for today.

179,personal locator beacons,,"<h2>FAQs about personal locator beacons</h2><h3>How much does a personal locator beacon cost?</h3><p>Prices vary depending on unit capability. The very best unit I reviewed costs almost $400 for the PLB alone, and the cheapest costs about $250. Most require service contracts or subscription fees (costs vary widely) for both emergency and non-emergency communication, so you should definitely factor that into the cost of ownership and use.</p><h3>How does a personal locator beacon work?</h3><p>When you press the SOS button, your PLB sends a powerful distress signal to a network of satellites around the globe. These distress signals are monitored by both government and private rescue coordination centers. The distress call is relayed to an appropriate response agency with data on your location. They, in turn, coordinate with local search and rescue organizations to come get your ass. Note that SAR assets vary from place to place, so you're probably going to get a faster, more capable rescue in the Tetons than you would in less-resourced countries.</p><h3>When should I use my personal locator beacon?</h3><p>Well, think of pressing SOS just like a 911 call. You should use it when you or a member of your team is at immediate risk of loss of life, sight, or limb, and when self-rescue and evacuation isn't the speediest option.</p>",211
74,in wall gun safes,,"<h2>FAQs about in-wall gun safes</h2><h3>Is a wall safe secure?</h3><p>Absolutely. Wall safes take the DNA of a standard gun safe and adapt it into a package that becomes one with your house. The typical locking mechanisms from other safes carry over including combination, keypads, and manual keys. Biometric locks are arguably the most secure.</p><h3>How deep is a wall safe?</h3><p>Aside from a small number of ""deep"" wall safes, most wall safes measure between three to six inches deep, just enough to fit in most walls without protruding out or intruding on possible pipes or wiring. Deeper wall safes can stretch to 10 inches.</p><h3>How can I hide my wall safe?</h3><p>Ever watch mystery thrillers or shows with elaborate supervillains holed up in mega-mansions? The right in-wall safe makes the perfect storage solution to hide behind TVs or picture frames. Some rifle safes can be stowed behind easy-to-maneuver bookshelves or curtains. Even try behind clothes hung up in your closet.</p><h3>Can you bolt a safe to the wall?</h3><p>In most cases, yes. Most in-wall safes will be sold with some form of mounting hardware in the form of either screws or bolts. In a few cases, some larger long gun safes may rely on their heft and their placement between the studs to resist movement and prying.</p>",210

Aerobic exercises can go anywhere from 45 to 90 minutes, whereas an anaerobic workout like a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workout could go from 5 to 20 minutes duration.</p><h3>Is a rowing machine safe for pregnancy?</h3><p>Rowing machines are an excellent choice for cardio workouts during pregnancies. Rowing machine workouts are low-impact and do not have the same balance considerations as treadmills and ellipticals. As with any physical activity during pregnancy, you should consult with a medical professional before undergoing a new fitness program.</p>",210
36,field watches,,"<h2>FAQs on field watches</h2><h3>Can you wear a field watch with a suit?</h3><p>Absolutely! Watches like the Hamilton Khaki King are almost specifically designed for this use, featuring field watch DNA, but with upgraded styling. Any of these watches on a quality leather strap will look fantastic and can serve as a nice nod to the wearer's outdoorsy tendencies when in more genteel environments.</p><h3>Why is it called a field watch?</h3><p>Field watches come from a long lineage of timepieces worn by military men and women, explorers, and workers, and are therefore usually designed with durability, legibility, and affordability in mind.</p><h3>Should field watches be small?</h3><p>Field watches are generally smaller, generally for the stated reason that they need to be wearable for many different body types, and need to not snag on anything while in use, given their heritage as general-issue military watches. However, larger options like the Orient Star Outdoor are fine and are just as much a field watch as a 36mm Vaer or 38mm Hamilton.</p><h3>What watch do the Navy SEALs wear?</h3><p>Whatever they want. Historically, the frogmen in Vietnam would often be seen with watches from Hamilton, Glycine, and Seiko. However, they generally preferred dive watches like the Seiko 6105, Seiko 62MAS, and the famous Rolex Submariner, owing to their amphibious mission.<br/>",209
121,mens running shoes,,"<h2>FAQs about men's running shoes</h2><h3>Should men's running shoes be a size bigger?</h3><p>The size of a running shoe varies depending on the brand. Some brands fit bigger than others while some fit true-to-size. If a shoe is too small, your feet will press against the shoe and you could lose a toenail. If a shoe is too big, your feet will slide and could blister. Therefore, before you buy, it's important to measure your feet and understand the fit of the shoe.</p><h3>What shoes do marathon runners wear?</h3><p>At the highest level, marathon runners wear whatever the best shoes their sponsors are able to provide. Everyone else has to balance performance with cost to find what works for them. It's a matter of personal preference.</p><h3>How do you tell if a shoe is for running?</h3><p>Pay attention to the language manufacturers use. Stay away from athletic shoes, jogging shoes, and cross-trainers. Stick to dedicated running shoes.</p><h3>How long should a pair of running shoes for men last?</h3><p>There are too many variables to give a one-size-fits-all answer, but 500 miles is a safe estimate. Pay attention to the midsole. When you see it starting to pack down, you'll know it can't provide as much cushioning as it used to and that it's time to move on.</p>",209
172,paracords,,"<h2>FAQs about paracords</h2><h3>How can you tell if a paracord is real?</h3><p>Since ""real"" paracord is anything that does what you need it to do, your first step is determining why you need it in the first place. Before you get wrapped around the axle about a paracord that can do everything under the sun, decide if you even need to care.</p><h3>What's the difference between 550 and 750 paracord?</h3><p>The most common kind of paracord is 550 cord, which typically has seven internal strands, a four-millimeter diameter, and a static load rating of 550 pounds. The larger 750 cord typically has 11 internal strands, a five-millimeter diameter, and a static load rating of 750 pounds.</p><h3>Can a paracord hold a person?</h3><p>Labels like ""550"" denote how many pounds of stress a given cord can endure before breaking. Remember that you apply much more force than your bodyweight if you're moving. Even if the cord itself can handle a certain load, that doesn't mean the knot and anchor at each end are up to the task.</p><h3>Does braiding paracord make it stronger?</h3><p>Yes, multiple pieces of paracord that provide mutual support will be stronger than a single strand. Be reasonable, though; even the mighty paracord has its limits and structural engineers study advanced math for a reason.</p>",209

91,hunting gps,,"<h2>FAQs about hunting GPS</h2><h3>Who makes the most accurate GPS?</h3><p>Garmin. Go through any list of top GPSes, and what you'll find is just a long list of Garmin devices.</p><h3>What is the difference between GPS and DGPS?</h3><p>The main difference between GPS and DGPS (Differential GPS) is the way in which a location is calculated. With a regular GPS, a signal is returned to the device via several satellites. With a DGPS system, the satellite information is sent through a secondary, fixed receiver that then transmits the data back to the main receiver, preventing signal degradation that can cause inaccuracies.</p><h3>What is the easiest GPS to use for hunting?</h3><p>Ease of use is often relative to the user, but generally, the devices that are easiest to use offer the fewest features. The more functions a device has, the more there is to learn to effectively use them. From a personal standpoint, if I were going to be spending a good chunk of money on a hunting GPS, I'd focus on its accuracy and durability before I worried about its ease of use.</p><h3>Is DGPS more accurate than GPS?</h3><p>Yes. While standard GPS is usually accurate to within 10 meters, the DGPS systems are accurate to around one meter or less (sometimes down to 10 centimeters).</p>",208

It's always best to double-check your local laws and restrictions. KnifeUp.com is a fantastic source for up-to-date information.</p><h3>How much does a machete usually cost?</h3><p>Most budget machetes are going to be extremely affordable, sitting at around $30 to $50. Mid-tier machetes are typically a little better quality, costing between $50 and $150, while high-end machetes simply go up from there. For practical uses, we'd stick with machetes in either the budget or mid-tier ranges.</p><h3>Why do machetes frequently come with poor factory edges?</h3><p>A mix of budget-minded blades and poor quality control. Many manufacturers expect that you'll be either beating the heck out of it or that you'll be capable of honing the edge if desired. And, to an extent, they're not wrong. You're likely not going to need a 20,000 grit, 17-degree edge on a machete; it wouldn't hold up to any serious use - unless, of course, you fancy yourself to be Rambo in need of a shave.</p>",207

With running socks, however, science plays an important role. Ideally, you want close-fitting, tight socks that hug your feet like they're afraid to fall off. This prevents chafing and blistering.</p><h3>Is it OK to go running without socks?</h3><p>Sure! You can go running without socks if you want to. Make sure to have a first aid kit with blister supplies ready for the end of your run. In most cases, socks are needed to protect your feet from the abuse of running in shoes.</p><h3>What is the difference between running socks and regular socks?</h3><p>Regular socks are basic and have no special features for running. They're not made to fit snuggly and are often just decorative. The materials used will vary and are not run-friendly.</p><h3>Why wear compression socks for running?</h3><p>Aside from the medicinal benefits of compression socks, every runner could benefit from increased circulation and support.

I like to have a multitool handy as well as a healthy cleaning kit. Extra optics for spotting are nice to have, too.</p><h3>How do you clean range bags?</h3><p>Start by keeping as much dirt and grime out of the bag as possible. Every bag will have its own cleaning instructions, but gentle soap and water usually do the trick. For stubborn dirt, enlist the help of a stiff-bristled brush.</p><h3>Is a backpack or duffel bag-style bag a better choice?</h3><p>A range bag can come in the form of a backpack or a duffel bag, but not all backpacks and duffels make good range bags.

73,1911 holsters,,"<h2>FAQs about 1911 holsters</h2><h3>How safe is a 1911 cocked and locked?</h3><p>Without sounding too flippant, a gun is only as safe as its user. However, if you do choose to carry with a round in the chamber, riding the hammer forward so it needs to be reset before a trigger pull can give you the speed you want in a self-defense situation while lowering the risk of an accidental discharge.</p><h3>What size holster do you need for a 1911?</h3><p>Whatever best fits your model of firearm. Regardless of what you choose, make sure it's comfortable and can hold your weapon safely with the hammer in either position.</p><h3>Can a 1911 fire with the hammer down?</h3><p>No, it cannot. That's why loading a round in the chamber for EDC, then riding the hammer forward, is a great added precaution if you feel the need to keep your weapon loaded in certain situations.</p><h3>Can a 1911 go off by itself?</h3><p>No, however older frames with a lot of wear and tear could drop the hammer if the weapon falls to the ground hard enough and the catch mechanism is released. If you have a poorly maintained weapon, first, shame on you, and second, you may want to reconsider carrying a round in the chamber.</p>",205
187,ab rollers,,"<h2>FAQs about ab rollers</h2><h3>Are ab rollers effective?</h3><p>Absolutely. As you go through the movements, you're holding your position to work your core isometrically, almost akin to a plank.

As you're striving to maintain your flat or mostly-flat position throughout your movements, you're not compressing your spinal discs and avoid risking a herniated disc. When done right, even a slight tuck as you roll in won't be enough to over flex your spine.</p><h3>Can an ab roller get me a six-pack?</h3><p>The best answer is maybe. Of course, like any solid routine, you can shave fat and build a brick wall of a gut, but that's also heavily influenced by intensity, frequency, and diet. Don't think of ab rollers as your endgame weapon but as an extra nifty tool at your disposal.</p><h3>Are ab rollers better than sit-ups?</h3><p>Ab rollers deliver an effective workout as you're utilizing your core to maintain position throughout the movements without stressing your lower spine.

As with any electrical system, make sure you understand how everything works and double-check any work you do yourself.</p><h3>What size solar generator should I get?</h3><p>Off-Grid Home has a good walkthrough for solar generator sizing, but the gist is that it depends on how much power you want. Use a watt meter to see exactly how much power a given appliance or device is currently using, then add up the consumption of everything you want to power.</p><h3>How many years will a solar generator last?</h3><p>You can expect the best solar generators to last more than 25 years. Proper care is important to getting the most out of this technology, so read the manufacturer's instructions for use and storage.</p><h3>Can I run my house on solar power only?</h3><p>Many people power their entire house with solar energy and have electricity leftover that may be sold back to the power company.

Matt Zirnsak from The Push Archery had a close call with multiple black bears on a hunt. Luckily, black bears are generally shy creatures. For the mobile hunter, the ghillie gives you great concealment, but you still have to be mindful of the wind and thermals.</p><h3>Are ghillie suits legal?</h3><p>Yes, there's nothing illegal about them. I know an insurance fraud investigator who used one to capture footage of a claimant in violation of his worker's compensation claim. However, the main conflict is the hunting field where you may be required by local or state law to wear orange.</p><h3>What ghillie suit does the military use?</h3><p>Generally, the individual sniper makes his/her own ghillie, but some units may issue ghillie kits to those in sniper or reconnaissance units.</p><h3>Do snipers wear ghillie suits?</h3><p>Yes, but it's very mission-specific. Not all situations will require them, and it's a piece of kit that most won't carry unless it's necessary due to its bulk. That said, they do make great blankets in the field on those cold nights/mornings along the Euphrates River.</p>",199

There are worse ways to spend $670, and the bragging rights alone are worth that much.</p><h3>What is the most reliable flashlight?</h3><p>There are a lot of companies that make reliable flashlights, but some of the features we look for are waterproof housings, protected lenses, and rechargeable batteries. Those features tend to be indicators of a well-built flashlight that can take a few knocks.</p><h3>What is the longest-lasting flashlight?</h3><p>Battery life is affected by so many things that it's hard to definitively say that one flashlight lasts the longest. What we can say is that a rechargeable flashlight and a solar power bank belong in everyone's survival kit or go-bag.</p><h3>How many lumens should a good flashlight have?</h3><p>If you're working in confined spaces and want to preserve some semblance of night vision, you might want a flashlight that can achieve double-digit lumen output. On the other hand, if you need to see across large, open areas, having 750 to 1,000 lumens to work with is a good idea.<br/>",199
