10,concealed carry holsters for women,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>When it comes to shooting and carrying firearms, I take things pretty seriously. I've been in and around the gun industry and community for about nine years and I'm always searching for the latest and greatest piece of gear that claims to solve all my problems with carrying a concealed firearm. I attend training courses as often as possible to ensure my proficiency doesn't suffer, as shooting is a perishable skill. Throughout my years, I've taken classes by well-known shooting instructors like Dave Maynard and John Correia, and from formal training schools as well.</p><p>Taking everything I can from these classes, I have applied the lessons to my daily life as a licensed concealed carry permit holder over the last three years. During my concealed carry journey, I have tried a vast array of concealed carry holsters that claim to offer the most comfortable and concealable package on the market. The biggest issue with most holsters on the market is not specifically if they will conceal well, but if they will conceal well with women's clothing.</p><p>While there are seemingly endless options for concealable holsters from a multitude of manufacturers, I set out to compile some of the best, specifically for women since we are generally overlooked by holster manufacturers who seem to think everybody who carries is a guy wearing a plaid shirt and loose cargo pants. I narrowed my search based on feedback that I have gotten from other women who carry on a daily basis, online sources, and things that I have learned throughout my time as a concealed carry permit holder.</p><p>I limited my search to holsters constructed from durable material and designed to completely cover the trigger guard. The reason is, we don't want any foreign object poking into the trigger guard and accidentally actuating the trigger. For this reason, nylon holsters and most leather holsters did not make it into my top picks. I tried to keep budget in mind, with most holsters landing in the $85 to $100 range, with a couple of exceptions for those who may need more specialized options.</p>",493
220,backpacking backpacks,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As is typical for our guides, I used a mix of extensive product and user research, expert evaluations, personal experience, and hands-on testing whenever possible. Having some experience hiking and backpacking myself, I looked for true backpacking packs, those that were durable and could carry 25 pounds or more of gear for multi-day trips in the backcountry. (You ultralight backpackers can sit back for a bit, as we're working on that guide next).</p><p>To make sure I wasn't missing out on current trends, I have also combed through backpacker forums for the past several months (e.g., r/backpacking on Reddit, Appalachian Trail hiker and Backpacker groups on Facebook, etc) to get a sense of what's popular (and what's not) with the folks who use these backpacks extensively. I then took this information and started to narrow down contenders for our list.</p><p>I also compared this evolving list to what other experts had created. For this article, I found these ""best of"" articles very helpful: Outdoor Gear Lab, Clever Hiker, Switchback Travel, and Gear Junkie. There's a ton of experience that evaluated these, and I found my selections aligned very well with theirs, as well as what I had gleaned from the previously mentioned backpacker social media groups.</p>",381
167,glock 19 holsters,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>When it comes to guns, I'm more than a hobbyist. I've worked in the gun industry for about nine years and, in that time, I've stayed on top of the latest trends and I've attended courses by renowned shooting instructors like Dave Maynard, John Correia, and other training schools as well. Additionally, I've been concealed-carrying a firearm everyday for the past three years. I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of marksmanship, and I've tried and used countless pieces of gear while carrying a concealed weapon. I know what works best for me and I've developed a sense of what works best in general.</p><p>While there are thousands of holsters available, we set out to find the best Glock 19 holster. We narrowed the search by looking at recommendations by other online sources and identifying key features that work best overall. We limited the search to designs constructed from hard plastic - in other words, we've excluded leather, nylon, and hybrid designs. The holsters we picked were obviously formed to fit a Glock 19 handgun, but also designed to completely cover the trigger guard. </p>",375
194,survival food kits,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Whereas all these items can be purchased online either through retail giants or company websites, a few of them were available in person for me to sample.I bought four individual pouches featured in their bulk kits, one entree and one breakfast from each brand, to sample each one's taste, texture, and ease of preparation. Items I couldn't source in a timely manner or haven't personally tried at all were reviewed through our usual research-based methods of digging through expert data and real-life consumer feedback.</p><p>It's in our best interests as journalists and fellow adventurers to provide the most informative yet honest reviews we can on every buyer's guide. Who knows if it could be close friends or even the writers themselves who will have to consult these some day? While it's not always feasible to sample every item in every survival food kit imaginable, that doesn't stop us from delivering the concise takes you need. We combine our real-world experiences with lengthy, tedious research, diving deep into expert and colleague opinions and, arguably the most important bit, consumer feedback. The best food kits will be the most readily available - meaning not currently sold out - easy to prepare, and best-tasting batches around with the trust of real consumers to boot.</p>",349
204,rifle cases,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>When selecting a rifle case, it's important to keep in mind the purpose of the case. Whether it's just a day trip to the range or a three-day hike into the woods for that perfect hunting spot, you need a case that's going to suit the job. So, I tried to approach this exercise from a position of meeting the needs of the mission rather than just the weapon.</p><p>To select rifle cases for this guide, I started out by searching Google Shopping and Amazon to find the most common results. Next, I narrowed my search to items I either own or have handled, and I also included items from reputable companies I have worked with before. I read through customer reviews as well, looking for basic issues and ideas I've encountered on my own.</p><p>At this point, I reviewed the features and functionality available to the individual options. I considered things like materials, design principles, and ease of use. I compared items I already own or am familiar with, or, in the cases of items I own, handled personally. I tried to think through how cases would handle in the real world, flaws I've encountered myself, and features I know make a product better.<br/>When possible, I reached out to manufacturers directly, raising any questions or concerns I had developed through my research process, trying to resolve those concerns. I spoke to fellow gun owners and enthusiasts as well, trying to get outside input on features and issues I'd encountered. Insofar as the items I had access to myself, I put them to the test, carrying them to the range, through the woods, and putting them through the ringer as much as possible before developing an opinion. I did everything possible to explore the quality and means of the products as much as possible, through whatever avenues available.</p><p>Furthermore, it's of the utmost importance to our team that our readers know our commitment to open, fair product recommendations and reviews, and that you can trust us to provide you with unbiased, balanced information.</p>",340
96,solar panels for camping,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I selected all of the solar panels in this review based on personal ownership, hands-on inspection, performance reputation, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. I take my time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything. For new items, I ask for samples from the makers and test them in the field. When that's not possible, I visit the products in the store. In either case, I also review the manufacturers' websites, user comments, YouTube reviews, and third-party evaluations, just to make sure I'm not missing anything.</p><p>When researching the best solar panels for camping, I based my criteria on my own experiences using outdoor gear in the field for more than 35 years. I'm very familiar with the major manufacturers of outdoor equipment, know their reputations, and have a sense of their customer service - which is also super important. I also speak with other people who spend considerable time outdoors for their thoughts as well.</p><p>After gathering enough high-performing products for a best-of article, I racked and stacked each based on their attributes, design, and performance. My bias is towards the lightest, best-functioning, and lowest-cost solutions available. We don't torture test gear here - we test within normal usage limits. When gear does fail or break, we contact the manufacturer to see if and how it stands by its products. I also take a look at how easy the gear is to maintain or repair in the field - the simpler, the better.</p><p>For final selection, I take all factors into consideration and think: What is the gear I'd most want in my pack? What would I trust my life to in the backcountry? Those are the recommendations I forward for your consideration. Furthermore, it's of the utmost importance to our team that our readers know our commitment to open, fair product recommendations and reviews, and that you can trust us to provide you with unbiased, balanced information.</p>",339
229,personal locator beacons,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I selected all of the personal locator beacons/satellite messengers in this review based on personal ownership, hands-on inspection, performance reputation, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. I take my time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.

197,hunting gps,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>""Hunting"" cannot be nailed down to any certain terms. For some, hunting is a sport. For others, it's a way of life, a means of survival, or an existential challenge, putting one's self closer in tune with their food source. There are many reasons for hunting, and with them, countless ways of putting it into practice. Recognizing this, we've sought to review a wide range of hunting GPS devices that would be suitable to any of your hunting needs, whether you are a local hunter, hunting your own land, or a worldwide adventurer, always seeking bigger challenges and greater game.</p><p>In order to make sure we are giving you the best recommendations possible, we've taken serious time to not only research individual items, their capabilities, and their shortcomings, but also to conduct interviews with fellow hunters and consult expert online sources to learn what people in the field are saying about their devices, how they put them into action, and their suggestions for best practices. Some of the online sources we found beneficial came from the good people at OutdoorLife, The Sporting News, and Eat Elk Meat.</p><p>When we talk about the ""best GPS for hunting,"" we might as well just say ""the best Garmin GPS for hunting"" because Garmin seems to have the market pretty much cornered on quality GPS systems. As you'll see below, most of our selections come from Garmin, which is primarily because it produces such a quality product, but also because there aren't a whole lot of other options that rate anywhere near it.</p><p>Just like you don't want to get lost in the woods on your next hunting trip, we don't want you getting lost in the purchasing process when it comes to your next hunting GPS, which is why we take our duty very seriously to give you the best recommendations possible. To learn more about our selections and review process, please check out our editorial guidelines here.</p>",322
209,ultralight sleeping bags,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I selected all of the ultra-lightweight sleeping bags in this review based on personal ownership, hands-on inspection, performance reputation, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. I take my time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything. For new items, I ask for samples from the makers and test them in the field. When that's not possible, I visit the products in the store. In either case, I also review the manufacturers' websites, user comments, YouTube reviews, and third-party evaluations, just to make sure I'm not missing anything.</p><p>When researching the best ultra-lightweight sleeping bags, I based my criteria on my own experiences using outdoor gear in the field for more than 35 years.

43,drop leg holsters,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As a veteran of a Coast Guard MSST Team and a lifelong firearms enthusiast, I'm very familiar with duty holsters. Both in my own unit and operating alongside other agencies - from local police departments to the Secret Service and FBI - Safariland was the gold standard for duty holsters (you might even say it was a safari of Safarilands). I used a Safariland 6005 with SLS for my Sig P229R DAK sidearm across countless deployments, boardings, and security zones, so I'm quite familiar with Safariland's offerings on the market and know its reputation for dependability is well-earned.</p><p>I've also used a variety of holster brands over the years and stayed up to date on new developments in the industry. To be among the best drop-leg holsters, a large section of the cheap ""universal"" nylon holsters were eliminated, as they just don't protect the firearm and trigger guard enough in the more exposed position of a drop-leg holster. This is not to say I didn't consider a range of more entry-level options for the folks out there just starting their careers, and I was pleased to see there are good choices in the under-$100 category, too.</p><p>I tried to pick holster and platform combos that seemed most representative of what a manufacturer or holster style can offer, factoring as many additional options into the review as possible. To keep things consistent, I used a bog-standard Glock 19 for each holster, and I also stuck to production holsters that are broadly available. From there, I tested each holster for an extended period of time doing various non-firing activities as well as during a long-range day up in the mountains. I also ran retention drills and shooting exercises drawing from different positions, founded upon my military/LE training and experience. </p>",296
92,camping coffee makers,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As always, personal experience, internal and external expert opinion, product research, and user reviews help decide what to include in this guide. I've spent a lot of time camping, backpacking, and hiking in Alaska, the Smokies, along the Appalachian mountains, and areas in between (to say nothing of deployment time in austere environments), and access to coffee is always a prime consideration. So I started pulling this list together by using this experience to scour the internet for coffee makers that could feasibly be used in the great outdoors.</p><p>Since any camping gear necessitates a certain degree of ruggedness and portability, these two characteristics guided our choices considerably. Plus, the product had to be functional in the isolation of a campsite (or deployment site). Weight and size are key considerations for campsite coffee makers, and you'll see that, with one exception, all the gear on this list are very lightweight and compact. Bottom line, the coffee makers that made this list had to be able to produce a good cup of joe, with minimal setup and teardown. Plus, it had to be tough enough to be banged around a bit.</p><p>As I narrowed down the contenders, I compared my list to other gear experts to see how our picks lined up. The outdoor experts at OutdoorGearLab, CleverHiker, and REI all curate great lists, and there are a number of areas where we overlap. I then determined the finalists by carefully reviewing product pages, both from the makers when possible, and on Amazon or other third-party vendor pages as well. Only products with an overwhelming percentage (greater than 70 percent) of positive reviews could make the cut. Click here for more info on our methodology.</p>",282
93,camping pillows,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>We selected camping pillows to test by seeing what's offered by retailers like REI and Amazon, as well as reputable brands like Therm-a-Rest and Sea to Summit. We sought items with features like an inflatable chamber, high loft memory foam, down or synthetic padding, a removable/washable cover, a contoured shape so the pillow fits neatly inside a sleeping bag hood and keeps the pillow centered on your neck, and a protective stuff sack or travel case.</p><p>We also took into consideration pack size and weight. Taken as a whole, a camping pillow's combined features will put it primarily in one of two categories: patrollers (backpackers) or FOB dwellers (car campers). If you're a patroller hiking on foot, you'll probably want something packable and lightweight. And, if you're car camping, why settle for an ultralight, ultrasmall camp pillow when you can have cabin comfort?</p><p>For this review, we conducted two different tests with the camping pillows. First, we evaluated ease of use, travel, and storage. And, second, we tested them for comfort. In the first test, we inflated and deflated the pillows (the ones with an air chamber), scrunched and twisted them, stuffed them into their travel sacks, and packed them into a backpack and toughbox to assess travel size and space. And in the second, we evaluated how comfortable they were to sleep on and we judged them based on two separate rounds of sleep: one with a cot and one without a cot. In both tests, we used the pillow with a sleeping pad and a sleeping bag. In total, we evaluated overall size, packability (reduced size), weight, loft, support, comfort, ability to clean, and overall durability.</p>",276
156,backpacking tents,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I'm an experienced long-distance backpacker. I spent 20 years humping overdesigned, heavy, and poorly designed military backpacks and tents, and now am on a quest to seek the lightest, best designed, and most economical backpacking and mountaineering gear on the planet. I have completed more than 700 miles of the Appalachian Trail to date, and have also done some epic climbs in places like the Grand Teton, Rocky Mountain, and Mount Rainier National Parks. I've owned and used more than seven tents in my time - everything from ultralight three-season tents to mountaineering tents that feel like portable bomb shelters.</p><p>To find the best backpacking tents for 2022, I reviewed and used a variety of tents and also solicited the input of friends who spend extensive time in the outdoors and a few mountain guides I know and respect - people who use this gear professionally in some pretty hazardous conditions.</p><p>I specifically looked at the following criteria: weight, design, floor area, quality of materials, weather resistance, ease of use, and packability. I also gave consideration to other factors like unique innovations, advanced materials, and headroom. All told, I'm pretty confident you won't go wrong with any tent on this list - I went after the best, but the trick is finding the right tent for your needs and uses.</p><p>All the backpacking tents in this review were selected based on personal ownership, performance reputation, hands-on inspection, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. I take my time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each tent, and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.</p>",274
3,butterfly knives,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Our tedious, in-depth research combined with real experience and knowledge serves to spare you hours in front of a screen. Video demonstrations, expert opinions and, most importantly, customer feedback help us decide on what butterfly knives are appropriate picks for this list. Websites such as Blade HQ and Knife Center are loaded with knives to choose from, accompanied by expert input and an encyclopedia of consumer reviews.</p><p>The best knives were typically multi-talented, purposeful blades that can not only sit pretty but dance, fight, and work with as much balance as possible. They represented strong value in their categories and were backed by armies of consumers who trust in their products. Only the best flippers, precise cutters, and most durable workhorses were considered for each category, with priorities shifting as categories got specific such as being the better EDC or trainers.</p><p>Additionally, it must be noted that there were plenty of acclaimed, top-notch knives that didn't make the cut (sorry) at the time of writing due to a lack of availability. Famous and popular models from companies like Benchmade, Squid Industries, or Bladerunner Systems (BRS) would appear all over different websites but would either be extremely limited, sold out, discontinued, or simply listed as ""unavailable."" We wanted to feature blades you can order the second this article dropped. What good are raving reviews when you can't buy the dang things? Blades with little-to-no consumer feedback or professional testing were also ignored as we heavily emphasize products with trusted, real-world backing.</p>",253
195,gun safes under 1000,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>We take gun safety seriously, especially when it comes to storage and security. For this article, we set out to find the best gun safes under $1,000, so all the options you'll find on this list are priced under that price point, but don't skimp on quality.</p><p>Not for lack of trying, but they - probably wisely - denied my request for 10 safes to be shipped to the testing site for an in-depth hands-on review. So instead, we scoured the internet for the best-rated free-standing gun safes designed not to break a budget.</p><p>We began by searching for long gun safes from reputable retailers and online marketplaces - Cabelas, Amazon, Midway USA, and others. Anything over $1,000 (before shipping and installation) was not considered.</p><p>Safes in the budget range we were looking for were then sorted by reviews, highest to lowest. Those with only a handful of reviews, even across multiple websites, were excluded. Once we had our models narrowed down to a few dozen, we focused on several key attributes necessary for proper care and security of your valued firearms: capacity, fireproofing duration, weight, warranty options, and several others.</p><p>The majority of these safes were solid choices, but had nothing to offer that set them apart from their more impressive competitors, so they were discarded from our pool. The ones that made the cut received our in-depth review which you can read for yourself below.</p>",233
223,life jackets,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As a former Coast Guard small boat crewman and a lifelong aquatics enthusiast, I relied on a great deal of past experience when making my choices for this list. I've personally used a variety of PFD types from many different brands, including more specialized devices like float coats and dry suits in about every kind of sea state there is and while performing complex tasks like law enforcement or search and rescue. This is why I harp on proper fit so much throughout my review, because it really does make a difference. Adjustability is the name of the game, so a generous range of adjustments is one of the top things I looked for. Brand reputation is another big one, so I only selected brands I personally trust to have great durability and consistently provide the safety they're rated for.</p><p>For child and infant life jackets, leg or crotch straps were a major factor as it's very easy for scrawny and squirmy youngsters to slip out of their PFDs without them. A Type II PFD was also a must for infants and toddlers, so that narrowed the field quite a bit in that category. For the best women's life jacket category, I know a lot of women boaters and aquatic adventurers out there, so it was a simple matter of surveying them for their favorite and least favorite features.</p>",228
158,boot knives,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>While we test a lot of gear here, we love knives. You should check out our extensive reviews of fixed blade, folding, and survival knives. I've previously reviewed the Schrade Frontier survival knife and the CRKT Overland folding knife. My personal interest in boot knives came as I searched for a replacement for a Gerber Guardian boot knife, which I lost years ago on a C130 somewhere in Iraq.</p><p>For this guide, I considered dozens of candidates. When picking knives to test, I used other ""best of"" lists for guidance as well as input from other reviewers. I also relied on my own experience and crowd-sourced information from vendor sites and Amazon. Using that research, I learned what key features make a boot knife ""good.""</p><p>To get the obvious out of the way first, a good boot knife should have the ability to fit comfortably in or on your boot or on your ankle. This limits the overall size of the knife: I limited this list to knives that are nine inches or shorter. Plus, it needs to fit comfortably in your hand (some knives were excluded from this list because of too many complaints that the handle was useless) while still being able to be worn discreetly. Finally, the sheath should lend itself to being securely clipped on the boot, or be easily modified for such use.</p>",226
206,machetes,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I've been collecting and selling knives for nearly a decade and was even a blacksmith's apprentice for a while. I've also written extensively about the subject here. In addition to writing guides about Damascus knives, utility knives, and karambits, I've also reviewed individual blades like the Cold Steel American Lawman, WE Stonefish, Leatherman Curl, Cold Steel Storm Cloud, QSP Penguin, and Spyderco Slip Stone. Bluntly put, I'm a nerd - pun intended.</p><p>For this article, we used recommendations shared in forums around the internet, particularly a handful of Facebook groups for knife enthusiasts. We relied on these sources because the members tend to provide better feedback than what you'd find in product review sections on most knife websites.</p><p>The machetes we selected came highly recommended because of their overall quality and performance. We looked for blades that were durable, versatile, and easy to maintain. We considered things like the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's reputation for quality control. We specifically looked for blades that were corrosion-resistant, either due to them being stainless steel, or having a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Wooden handles were avoided due to their tendency to splinter and retain moisture. Lastly, we eliminated any machetes that had partial tangs or thin rat-tail tangs, due to their tendency to be weaker than full tangs.</p>",226
145,solar watches,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I'm an experienced watch collector who has written multiple articles about the subject. I've written extensively about dive watches and aviation watches. On top of that, if you browse the our library, you'll find several more watch-buying guides covering topics like running watches, survival watches, and even the best tritium watches.</p><p>To find the best solar-powered watches, we bought and wore a variety of solar watches as well as collected input from other watch owners. We relied on people who buy solar watches not just because they want them, but because they know watches. These are people like ""Shane,"" the host of the trusted watch review channel Relative Time.</p><p>In our effort to find the best solar watches, we tested watches for their ability to keep time, and we judged appearance and design by comparing them to luxury watches and how they fit on the wrist. We also gave consideration to watches with original designs or unique features if they also satisfied the other criteria. With that said, in this article you'll find the best watches that use a solar movement, no matter who you are.<br/>Like most of our buyer's guides, we used a combination of hands-on testing and crowdsourced information to deliver a comprehensive product list. For more information on methodology, check out our editorial guidelines for reviewing the latest and greatest in gear and technology.</p>",225
183,rangefinders for hunting,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Researching rangefinders for hunting was a pretty extensive process, with a lot of fun and interesting rabbit holes to stumble into along the way. Like binoculars, rangefinders can be pretty complicated in their construction alone, having to take into account such aspects as glass quality, glass coatings, magnification powers, objective lens size, housing-case material, and water- and fog-proofing. Fortunately, a lot of this knowledge had already been gathered while researching our binocular recommendations a few months back.</p><p>The real complications come in the features that set rangefinders apart, which are all the electronic gadgetry shooting honest-to-god laser beams, collecting laser beams, and translating laser beams into useful ballistics information. Being a bowhunter, who usually hunts from a treestand in a wooded area with a max shot range of 40 yards, I've never really had much need for ballistics calculations. Fortunately, there are plenty of websites out there that can teach you everything you need to know to make a sound rangefinder pick, such as this informative article from Bushnell.</p><p>Armed with my new knowledge, I scoured other top rangefinder lists and product reviews, while pitting them against the recommendations of fellow hunters in my life. What I've produced is a list I'm confident will help you make a smart decision on the best hunting rangefinder to meet your needs.</p>",217
210,field jackets,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>When trying to select our suggestions for this article, I looked at what makes a field jacket great: warmth, durability, and lots of pocket space. Historically, the field jacket was supposed to be something a soldier could wear in the field, pockets stuffed full of extra ammo or rations, and keeping the weather off their back. I stuck with companies who have lived up to that expectation historically and products that fit that design philosophy. I also pored over some of the most popular options, some of the most heavily-advertised results on social media and in Google search results, and weeded through those options that were most obviously cheap knock-offs.</p><p>When you've spent enough time outdoors and at hard labor, certain design choices and materials stand out as being of lesser quality. Even beyond my own experience in the U.S. Army, I've spent years personally buying a wide range of jackets from a variety of manufacturers, and have learned some little tricks to be able to tell how a product will perform over the long term. Little things like how a jacket is cut can tell you how much range of motion you're going to get, or what materials let in too much water or don't breathe as well become obvious.</p>",210
222,water purification tablets,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I gotta be honest with you: water purification tablets aren't my first choice when moving through the hills. I prefer mechanical means to filter my water - like the GravityWorks Platypus or Katadyn BeFree or the Sawyer Squeeze systems. Sure, they're heavier to carry than a bottle of drops or tablets, and sometimes unnecessary, but in the 30 plus years I've been going to the backcountry, I haven't gotten sick yet. And I'm not saying tablets aren't as good. In many cases they're better, but they too have their downsides. More on that later.</p><p>So, how did I choose products for this review? I went to people who love water purification tablets and asked for their opinions. I read countless reviews and also a bunch of scientific literature on their efficacy. Then I culled that list to the best ones based on a number of criteria. Essentially, I wanted to know several things: 1) Do they kill most of the creepy crawlies that will turn your guts into mud and ruin your day? 2) How long does it take them to work? 3) Do they make water taste ok or like ass afterwards? (You aren't as likely to hydrate with water that repels you.) and 4) Are they simple to use?</p>",210
237,camping knives,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I've been collecting and selling knives for about a decade, and was even a blacksmith apprentice for a while. I've also written extensively about the subject here. In addition to writing guides about Damascus knives, utility knives, and karambit knives, I've also reviewed individual blades like the Cold Steel American Lawman, WE Stonefish, Leatherman Curl, Cold Steel Storm Cloud, QSP Penguin, and Spyderco Slip Stone. Bluntly put, I'm a nerd - pun intended.</p><p>For this article, we used recommendations shared in forums around the internet, particularly a handful of Facebook groups for knife enthusiasts. We relied on these sources because the members tend to provide better feedback than what you'd find in product review sections on most knife websites.</p><p>The knives we selected came highly recommended because of their overall quality and performance. We looked for blades that were durable, versatile, and easy to maintain. We also considered things like the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's reputation for quality control. We specifically looked for blades that were corrosion-resistant, either due to them being stainless steel, or having a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Leather and cloth sheaths were avoided, as were wooden handles, due to their tendency to retain moisture.</p>",209
176,solar generators,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>There was a time when, like most people, we thought solar energy was a simple concept: plug a solar panel into a solar generator and off you go. Enjoy your free electricity. It turns out that there's a lot more to it than that. Solar energy that's collected by one of several kinds of solar panels needs to be regulated to ensure safe delivery into the battery. The solar generator needs to convert stored energy into a form that can be used by devices that consume either alternating- or direct-current electricity.</p><p>To make sure you got solid information, we spent days researching all of this and found some great resources to pass along. Armed with that information, we sought out solar generators that are adequate for several days of use on a single charge. Every product that made our list had to offer AC and DC charging. The ability to charge via solar panels was obviously a must, but we looked for solar generators that can be purchased individually so you have the flexibility to customize a setup to meet your specific needs. Finally, we gave priority to brands that either had a proven record of success or could provide a product for us to test for ourselves.</p>",207
208,tactical knives,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I've been collecting and selling knives for nearly a decade and was even a blacksmith's apprentice for a while. I've also written extensively about the subject here. In addition to writing guides about Damascus knives, utility knives, and karambits, I've also reviewed individual blades like the Cold Steel American Lawman, WE Stonefish, Leatherman Curl, Cold Steel Storm Cloud, QSP Penguin, and Spyderco Slip Stone. Bluntly put, I'm a nerd - pun intended.</p><p>For this article, we used recommendations shared in forums around the internet, particularly a handful of Facebook groups for knife enthusiasts. We relied on these sources because the members tend to provide better feedback than what you'd find in product review sections on most knife websites.</p><p>The knives we selected came highly recommended because of their overall quality and performance. We looked for blades that were durable, versatile, and easy to maintain. We considered things like the materials used for the blade, handle, and sheath, as well as the manufacturer's reputation for quality control. We specifically looked for blades that were corrosion-resistant, either due to them being stainless steel, or having a protective coating if they were high carbon steel. Leather sheaths were avoided, as were wooden handles, due to their tendency to retain moisture.</p>",205
52,hiking pants for women,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Unlike in my review of the best running shorts for women, when reviewing different hiking pants for women for this piece, price took more of a back seat to the quality of the pants and their materials. After all, your running shorts will rarely mean the difference between life or death, but your hiking pants impact not only your comfort and enjoyment, but can also prevent you from sliding into hypothermia and even death when the weather turns unexpectedly bad on you. While there are a lot of cheap, non-name brand options for women's hiking pants on sites like Amazon, we aren't fooled when the description says they are waterproof.</p><p>Because of the impact a good pair of hiking pants can have on your safety, how well the pants I reviewed can protect you from the elements was first and foremost in my mind. Other than the one budget winter pair we highlight here that are good enough for occasional, good weather hikers, we did not review products that promised to be waterproof. Instead, my top picks were based on weather resistance, wicking power, design, and durability. Usable pockets got extra stars since women's pants tend to lack them.</p>",203
192,shooting mats,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>In this article, we recommend the best shooting mats for use in the field or at the range. Our selections are based on experience with comparable equipment at Gunsite Academy's Long Range Precision Rifle course and extensive research including reviews of manufacturer specifications, professional publications, product videos, and other sources.</p><p>Our research started with identifying the key characteristics essential to the performance of a quality shooting mat, namely dimensions, thickness, material, and weight. These characteristics are discussed in detail later in this article in the section ""What to consider when buying a shooting mat.""</p><p>Our research team then searched for shooting mats on e-commerce websites including Amazon, Cabela's, OpticsPlanet, Brownells, MidwayUSA, and many more, with a focus on selecting those products that offer an optimal balance between design characteristics. The most promising shooting mats were then selected for in-depth research via consumer and independent third-party print and video reviews, as well as discussions within our community of recreational shooters, hunters, and military personnel.</p><p>The final research step leveraged all the data, results, and commentary to develop specific questions for each manufacturer. The answers provided by the manufacturers gave us a better understanding of each shooting mat's performance and helped us develop our final set of recommendations.</p>",203
200,gun cases,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>The majority of our review team are either current or former servicemen or hobbyists like me who work in related professions. I'm a former law enforcement officer and lifelong hunter. No matter our profession, we are serious about gear, especially when it comes to gun stuff. We recognize the importance of gun safety and ease of use. We take this approach when we talk about holsters, optics, gun safes, and now gun cases.</p><p>For this guide, I surveyed military personnel, hunters, and other law enforcement officers about the gun cases they use and why. Considering their opinions and my own experiences, I found the best gun cases based on price point, durability, and overall performance in the field - in other words, what I'd want in a gun case.</p><p>Looking for the best gun cases, I searched for the highest-rated and best-selling options by the most popular gun case manufacturers and sellers. After identifying a list of top-tier gun cases, I narrowed my search by reading performance and user reviews.</p><p>When I reviewed performance, I paid close attention to performance and price. I relied on user reviews published on ecommerce sites like Amazon, reviews on independent websites, and my personal experience with the item. </p>",202
231,backpacking meals,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As journalists and fellow adventurers, we always seek to deliver the most informative yet honest reviews possible in every buyer's guide we curate. This guide has been curated mostly through extensive research and deep dives into company specs and, more importantly, real-world consumer experiences. While Amazon continued to serve as a useful encyclopedia of customer input, the widespread availability of backpacking meals has also allowed other sources to aid in curating our guide, including REI, Scheels, Walmart, and numerous food brand websites. Their availability has made it relatively easy for this author to perform some hands-on nitpicking on a few brands.</p><p>Quick stops at my local REI rewarded me with meals from Mountain House and Peak Refuel to sample for this guide, plus a previous guide to survival food kits. I examined taste, how filling they were, and how easy they were to prepare using the recommended methods. As an outdoor specialist, I'm no stranger to MREs either and was able to deliver feedback based on real-world experiences with such items. The best meals sacrificed little-to-none in terms of taste and texture versus something you'd buy in cans from the grocery store while effectively fitting their niche (vegan-friendly or high in calories).</p>",202
221,garmin watches,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Narrowing down the best Garmin watches can be daunting and subjective. In this case, I focused my attention on determining which ones work best in a military context. That might mean navigating uncharted terrain during a deployment to a hostile environment, or it could mean keeping you on pace to crush your annual fitness test. Features like night vision compatibility and stealth mode were given preference, but so were ones like contactless payment and the ability to control your music during a training run on your own time. I did my best to narrow the extensive list of Garmin watches currently available to the best overall, the best on a budget, and the best in two other price categories.</p><p>In the case of the tactix 7 and Instinct 2, I was able to put test units through their paces myself over the span of several months. You'll find specific aspects of those watches that stood out in their respective sections of this gear guide. </p><p>The result of this is a Garmin watch review that's written from a military perspective for people in the military - or those who have separated and are keeping the tradition alive.</p>",195
185,spotlights,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>In a perfect world, I would be able to get hands-on with the best spotlights available to put them through rigorous testing and provide you with scientifically measured data to decide on. That just wasn't feasible for this best spotlights review, so instead, I had to rely on my personal experiences in the military and construction worlds. Having used several different types of spotlights gave me a base knowledge to conduct in-depth research to evaluate each product objectively.</p><p>As a writer here, I've developed this skill through articles like the best gun oils, best camping chairs, and best running socks where there are an overwhelming amount of choices. We have covered the illuminating choices for the best 1000 lumen flashlights, headlamps, rechargeable flashlights, and EDC flashlights.</p><p>For this article, I relied heavily on personal experience with brands like DeWalt, Makita, and Streamlight for baseline information. I also compared other buying guides to identify spotlight options that would fit the different categories selected. I avoided spotlights with unrealistic claims, questionable or inconsistent information, and products and brands with known histories of quality control issues. The below result is a selection of the best spotlights you can buy.</p>",194
226,paracords,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Before I even started my search for the best paracords, I took a minute to revisit some of the ways people use the stuff. All of us have probably used 550 cord to build a shelter out of a tarp or tie serialized gear to ourselves (shoutout to my peers who got to participate in the great PEQ-15 search of 2011), but more important tasks include repairing broken gear, building more durable bushcraft shelters, building makeshift tools, and even catching something to eat when the going gets tough. I even took the opportunity to practice some of those skills by upgrading my trusty get-home bag with a paracord-wrapped handle.</p><p>After finding a solid value option for my budget-conscious readers, I dug a little deeper to find more advanced paracord options with higher load ratings and better features. One of my guiding lights was MIL-C-5040H, the U.S. military's standard for paracord construction. The rest of my picks had to meet or exceed that standard. After sifting through what seemed like endless search results of suspect products, I found two that I would trust to get me to the ends of the Earth and back.</p>",192
28,backpack coolers,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Having deployed in almost every aspect of Naval Warfare, as well as being an avid outdoorsman, I have an idea of what materials and designs are built to last and perform. I took all that knowledge and came up with a list of the best backpack coolers available today.</p><p>I started my search with trusted brands like Yeti, Coleman, and Igloo. Then, I rounded out the list with some surprises like Icemule, RTIC, and REI - companies you may not recognize as backpack cooler makers. This list has a litany of capabilities, running the gambit from day-use to full-on backcountry adventures. To surmise, I chose the gear that has a good track record and those I would personally want.</p><p>For this review, I tested every backpack hands-on and pitted them against each other to really find out which backpack reigned supreme. If these packs advertised certain capabilities like waterproofing or ice retention, I put them to the test. Every person's needs in a backpack cooler are different, so I made sure to let you know exactly which pursuits the backpack excelled at to narrow your search.</p>",184
186,hunting boots,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Picking a flavor for a single-scoop cone at Baskin-Robbins is easier than picking a hunting boot. With so many combinations of boot types, features, and manufacturers, a filtering process is the only way to avoid true analysis paralysis and willy-nilly purchases. As such, I looked for boots with a combination of comfort, traction, toughness, durability, and weather resistance.</p><p>By nature of living in Colorado, I primarily focused on hiking-style boots designed to take down game commonly found in the West and Midwest (mostly big game, turkey, coyotes, and upland birds). Whenever possible, I tried to find boots with a women's version or direct equivalent, although this was not nearly as easy as it sounds.</p><p>Also, I relied heavily on hands-on reviews and similar written materials to help evaluate each boot. </p>",184
219,aviator sunglasses,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Aviator sunglasses have been around since 1936 when they were developed by Bausch & Lomb to protect pilots' eyes from the harsh glare of the sun at altitude. Generals, actors, and rock stars have made the design a cultural icon for nearly a century. As you can imagine, the style has been picked up by countless manufacturers since then. A quick search on Amazon brought up seven pages of results - most of them from brands I've never heard of.</p><p>Out of respect for your money, I immediately discarded any products from dubious manufacturers and sellers. Only established, trusted names like Ray-Ban and Michael Kors made the cut. Oh, and Jessica Simpson because she did release a tribute to the Top Gun soundtrack back in the day.</p><p>For the most part, I stayed true to the original aviators with the timeless teardrop shape, although I had to make an exception for Ray-Ban's Caravan shades out of respect for Goose's son in the new Top Gun: Maverick movie.</p><p>Finally, I tried to hit a few different price points to put a quality set of aviators in everyone's budget.</p>",184
90,gun belts,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>To build this list, I based it on products that I've personally used, along with interviews with professional end-users and the manufacturers themselves. I limited the belts on this list to tactical nylon ""gunfighter belts"" rather than expanding it to belts for concealed carry, padded ""battle belts,"" and leather duty belts for law enforcement use, simply because of the fact that those are topics in and of themselves, and this list would easily be an entire book if I included all of them.</p><p>You may notice that the Ronin Tactics Senshi belt is not on the list, and that's mostly because Ronin belts are manufactured under contract by AWS, so I'd recommend AWS instead. The GBRS Group Assaulter belt is not on this list because for most users, the advantages over the Ferro Concepts Bison belt are not appreciable, and the Ferro belt is still lighter.</p><p>Finally, I've generally avoided companies that engage in ""drop"" marketing, as end-users who need a quality belt solution sooner rather than later aren't always willing to wait for the next hyper-limited drop.</p>",181
205,generators for camping,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I started my market research by considering why people need generators for camping, to begin with. If all we needed to power was a phone and Bluetooth headphones, we'd use a pocket-sized power bank. Campers in the market for a generator probably need enough energy to power larger devices like a laptop, some lighting, and maybe an electric grill - so that's where my search began. My picks for this list have power capacities from 200 to 3,000 watt-hours.</p><p>I researched how different styles of generators work to understand the advantages and disadvantages of fuel-burning and solar-powered generators. I crowd-sourced reviews of popular models and turned to sources ranging from the U.S. Energy Information Administration to Home Depot to understand where our power comes from and how we use it.</p><p>I prioritized solar generators because they're more environmentally friendly, simpler to operate, and don't constantly consume increasingly expensive fuel. I also focused on manufacturers I know to consistently build quality products. The result is a short but carefully curated list of some of the best generators for camping you can buy right now.</p>",181
189,ghillie suits,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Researching ghillie suits available on the market is an interesting process. For the consumer, there is no lack of options available. Some of these range from products on Amazon that are probably better suited for Halloween to some of the reviewed products that are field-ready. Some of the criteria that I weighed heavily on were durability and construction, breathability, packability, color palette, and application. As an alternative, 3D leaf suit products were also reviewed that are more specific to hunting. Most of this research was conducted through field testing and prior experience.</p><p>The internet is full of forums and articles on ghillies. There's no doubt there exists some great information out there, as well as not-so-great. My experience is diverse, but I don't know everything. For additional reference, I also reached out to others with similar backgrounds like KUIU's Justin Shaffer, who is also a former Army sniper, and Matt Zirnsak from The Push Archery who uses ghillies to hunt turkeys and white-tailed deer. With these additional perspectives, I jumped head-on into product reviews and other top ghillie lists. </p>",179
236,hiking daypacks,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>In this article, we recommend the best daypacks for hiking in the field. Our selections are based on personal experience with many different brands over many miles of trails, as well as extensive research of the manufacturer's specifications, professional publications, product videos, and other sources.</p><p>Our research started with identifying the key characteristics essential to the performance of a quality daypack, namely capacity, weight, and fit. These characteristics are discussed above in the section ""Things to consider before buying a daypack.""</p><p>We then searched for daypacks on e-commerce websites including Amazon, REI, Cabela's, Backcountry, Campmor, and others, with a focus on selecting those products that offer an optimal balance between design characteristics. The most promising daypacks were then selected for in-depth research via consumer and independent third-party print and video reviews, as well as discussions within our community.</p><p>The final research step leveraged all the data, results, and commentary to develop specific questions for each manufacturer. The answers provided by the manufacturers gave us a better understanding of each daypack's performance and helped us develop our final set of recommendations.</p>",177
199,biometric gun safes,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As journalists and fellow firearms enthusiasts, it's in our best interest to deliver informative and honest reviews anywhere we can. That said, it would be quite the timely and costly endeavor to get our grubby mitts on a dozen safes, which is why this guide is heavily research-driven. Deep dives into each and every product combined with real-life user experience helped this author determine which would serve discerning enthusiasts the best for each of your specific use cases.</p><p>The best gun safes would be the most robust, make the most efficient use of space, and have easy-to-program biometric scanners with little fuss, an important factor in a relatively cumbersome category of gun safes. Products with little-to-no consumer feedback were ignored in favor of items with real-world customer experiences.</p><p>Amazon served as a major hub of manufacturer specs and consumer feedback on a plethora of products, but quick web searches revealed many more worthwhile products. Because of that, retailers such as Lowes, Home Depot, and Gun Safes were equally valuable sources of product information and ownership experiences.</p>",174
50,hiking boots,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>How does a piece of gear make it onto our list? That's simple - by earning enough of our trust to make us want to use it ourselves. We test a lot of gear. Some of it sticks around and becomes a staff favorite, and some of it can't get sent on its way fast enough. We let you know either way, but these roundups are a great way to find the best of the best all in one place.</p><p>In addition to performing well as a hiking boot, we like to sniff out deals for you. There's no reason to spend more than you need to. Budget options and premium picks make their way to the list, too, but products that pack a ton of value into a small price tag are popular with us. Finally, we like to find products that stand out from the crowd. If a boot offers a particularly interesting feature or offers a unique advantage, that's something we want you to know about.</p>",173
27,ankle holsters,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Like with any rig, choosing a good ankle holster takes time and consideration. Before anything made it onto this list, we took some time to see what features were worth the dough and which ones weren't. Besides the price tag, firearm retention, and stability, comfort was another important consideration. The reality is that if your concealed firearm drops to the floor as soon as you start climbing the stairs, your holster is useless. Of course, a holster that moves throughout the day will lead to an inconsistent, unpredictable draw-increasing variable that will dramatically hinder your draw, and under stress, you may find yourself scrambling for a loose gun rather than engaging the threat.</p><p>As we sifted through various hands-on reviews and other user feedback, we found a handful of sources that provided some valuable insights into the holsters that made our list. In particular, we appreciate the information provided by American Arms, ConcealedCarry.com, Green Light Shooting, Gun News Daily, PilotPatriot, Range 365, Shooting Illustrated, and USA Carry.</p>",171
224,4 season tents,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>To narrow down our recommendations for the best 4-season tents, we first considered 24 brands that make reliable camping gear. From here, we honed in on materials that are proven to stand up to rain, wind, and snow, while still being breathable enough to not turn into a sauna come summer temps.</p><p>We also took notes of the materials of the tent poles to compare strength versus weight. Then we dove deeper into the tent's size, how many people each tent slept, the overall weight, and how easy or terrible it was to set up. We also took into account whether each tent had a vestibule for unloaded gear and if it came with its own footprint or if that was a separate purchase. We turned to both customer and expert reviews to compile common praises or complaints.</p><p>All things considered, we pared down our recommendations into categories we thought would serve the reader best. Whenever possible, we test items ourselves to get first-hand experience of how a product performs in the wild.</p>",171
78,winter hiking boots,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Recommending winter hiking boots isn't as easy as it seems, especially considering the wide variety of terrain and weather conditions a given hiker is likely to encounter in their area of the world. Still, certain features were non-negotiables. All boots on this list met the expectation of possessing proper waterproofing (or long-term water resistance for budget options), proper insulation (minimum of 200 grams), an aggressive tread, a medium to tall shaft rise, a lace-up design, and a reasonable expectation of durability. For all but the budget boots, our choices had to be available in both men's and women's variants.</p><p>I also consulted a number of hands-on reviews to get a better sense of these boots' performance in the wild. In particular, I found the following resources particularly valuable: Backpacker.com (three different articles), Fat-Bike.com, Field & Stream, GearJunkie, Gear Patrol, GearWeAre.com, Guns.com, Outdoor Gear Lab (two articles), Outdoor Life, SectionHiker.com (two articles), Style Altitude, TheShoesFinder, The Fun Outdoors, Tactical Distributors, and Track and Pursue.</p>",167
201,paracord bracelets,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I'm a bit of a paracord hobbyist and made my first cobra bracelet in 2009 with OD green 550 cord and a button from a pair of old cammies that I cut the center out of. Since then, I've made bracelets, keychains, dog collars, and a dog leash in varying patterns and colors. Throughout my hobbying, I've spent countless hours reading the resources at Paracord Planet and watching videos by professionals like Weavers of Eternity.</p><p>When selecting the products for this best paracord review, I specifically looked at the quality of each bracelet to see how consistent the weaves are and for a clean finish. I combined my personal knowledge and experience with customer reviews for good measure. The research and selection process was similar to work I've done in my previous articles on backpacking sleeping pads and camping chairs.</p><p>If you're looking to build or improve your survival kits, our library has great selections including emergency food kits, survival radios, wilderness survival books, and, of course, survival knives.</p>",167
211,gun safes under 500,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>When looking for a quality gun safe for myself or someone else, I try to find one that's feature-rich but not too expensive. I also consider the purpose of the safe. While they all generally do the same thing, trying to limit access to firearms is different than protecting them.</p><p>For this article, I narrowed my search to safes that are California DOJ-approved since that's where I live, and I figured if something is good enough for California, it should be good enough for wherever you live. I also considered feedback in product reviews and YouTube videos, and I relied on personal experience I've had throughout the years.</p><p>Not all of the safes on this list are meant to withstand being pulled out of the ground and dragged away by thieves with a truck, but they will all offer protection from unauthorized access, at least temporarily. For this review guide, I graded the safes based on cost, features, ease of use, thickness of the walls, and locking mechanisms.</p>",166
164,duffel bags,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>First and foremost, in any buying guide I assemble is what you're going to need to get the job done in all areas of your life. This shapes the categories and gives me a heading when I begin searching the internet.</p><p>We've got a great team here, and for duffel bags, I started with my fellow writers for recommendations and experiences. These added context to my own experiences, which is where I gain a larger perspective. Armed with perspective and categories, I began searching websites like Amazon, Cabelas, Walmart, and even specific manufacturer websites.</p><p>To select the right duffel bags, I relied heavily on industry knowledge and experience around designs and materials. Each duffel was evaluated on its ability to function in the selected category and other performance criteria indicated in the reviews below. I also looked at the brand's reputation and history as an indicator of trustworthiness. Your voice matters, too, and if you've got some experience you'd like to share, please leave a comment below.</p>",165
55,binoculars for hunting,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When making selections for our list, I pored over tons of online reviews, ""best-of"" lists, and got as much hands-on experience as I could. While I certainly could have skewed our list to the best of the low price binos or the best of the insanely high-priced binos (because there are A LOT out there), I tried to stick with those selections that would be most versatile to the average hunter with an average amount of disposable income.</p><p>For most of us, we aren't out stalking caribou 365 days a year and we may never fly a bush plane into the wild edge of Alaska to tag a bull moose, so it doesn't really make sense to buy hunting binoculars benefitting that type of hunt. For me personally, my binos will get the most bang for their buck if they're suited for whitetail hunting right here in Michigan, so that's the mentality I took when putting this all together.</p>",163
11,cross draw holsters,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Cross-draw holsters are a rare find, but they are expected to do the same job as any other holster. As such, I made sure to find holsters that adhered as closely as possible to John Correia's definition of what makes a good holster. I also hit up the Buckeye Firearms Association, Craft Holsters, Galco, GunDigestTV, hrfunk, JM4 Tactical, and USCCA to supplement what I already knew about cross-draw holsters.</p><p>Next, I combed through Amazon, Optics Planet, and other online retailers, as well as YouTube and internet search engines, to find the best holsters I could find. Videos from Gun Talk Media and other outlets were helpful for getting a sense of each offering.</p><p>Finally, I watched and read a good number of cross-draw holster reviews to verify (or challenge) my initial findings and to get a better sense of the pros and cons of my final selections. I found GunCollector007, The Maglife Blog, Slim Cowboy, and yankeecowboy to be especially helpful in this regard.</p>",162
45,fishing backpacks,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Fishing is not a ""one-size-fits-all"" activity, and an angler's needs in a fishing backpack can range widely depending on the style of fishing and the prospective quarry. With these different needs in mind, we tried to incorporate recommendations that would best cover the spectrum of needs. In order to find our best picks, we scoured countless lists of top tackle bags, sling bags, hip packs, and chest packs. We did hands-on testing of most of the listed bags, packing them with our own gear to test durability, accessibility, and storage capacity. We read customer reviews and bounced Amazon product pages off from manufacturing product pages to ensure the accuracy of information. After all of this, I feel confident in the recommendations we've made, and though I can't guarantee you'll catch more fish because of it, I can guarantee these bags will help you keep your line in the water for longer, which is usually half the battle.</p>",162
233,dry bags,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Protecting your gear from water is a high-stakes endeavor. Because of that, I took extra care to limit my search for the best dry bags to brands and products I know and trust. Even though I haven't used all of the products on this list myself, I have used the brands you see in my greatest hits list of waterproof backpacks. Are there other decent dry bags out there? Of course - and I invite you to share your own experiences in the comments section - but I can personally vouch for the dry bags that made the cut for this gear guide.</p><p>Outside of manufacturers, I looked for dry bags in a range of sizes, because there will be times when you want to stuff all your gear in a dry bag, and times when you just need to protect a few valuables or spare sets of socks. Unique features like see-through material or removable shoulder straps got special consideration, too.</p>",161
198,north face backpacks,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Evaluating a single product type from a single manufacturer is a bit more daunting than it sounds, especially when many of them sport the same add-ons. Nevertheless, I suffered and bled for you, dear reader. I picked apart every detail to see which North Face packs were most worthy of your money. To ease my travails, I paid attention to both standard and not-so-standard features, as well as each bag's intended use case to see how each one came together in its own unique way. To simplify things, I focused on ""urban"" bags, backpacks designed for EDC carry, travel, school, or work.</p><p>Objective evaluations were also a challenge. In 2021, The North Face conducted a product line refresh, so I looked long and hard to find relevant reviews, a significant test in its own right. In the end, though, I did prevail. Special thanks goes out to Desy Cheng, the GearLab staff, Moorlander EDC, and Traveling Salseros (more than once). </p>",160
150,under bed gun safes,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>The home security market is full of smoke and mirrors, so selecting a gun safe can be a tricky endeavor. That said, there are certain features that are non-negotiables that we refuse to ignore. All quality gun safes will feature a solid build and anchor holes to make sure you can ensure a thief can't simply walk off with your safe over their shoulder so they can crack it later. While we much prefer the reliability of mechanical locks, only safes equipped with electronic safes made the cut due to the previous two factors.</p><p>While creating this guide, we relied on hands-on reviews from actual users to make sure you receive the best information available. In particular, we want to thank Expert Safe Reviews, Lucky Gunner Ammo, TheSafeist, SnareMan, and Valor Life for their valuable contributions. We also relied a good bit on our own knowledge of safes, home security, and the criminal mind to find the best safes available.</p>",159
217,hardshell jackets,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>A lot of the gear we test here can have life-saving implications, but the apparel that stands between you and the elements is particularly important. Product selection for this gear guide was informed by my experience in the military, camping, and skiing. I also consulted fellow gear testers with extensive backcountry credibility. Finally, to minimize our collective blind spots, I spent hours reading up on lesser-known brands and new product releases to crowd-source even more knowledge.</p><p>In addition to the brands that made the final cut - Arc'teryx, Black Diamond, Fjallraven, Helly Hansen, Patagonia, and The North Face - I considered hardshell jackets from Eddie Bauer, Kuiu, and Mammut, Outdoor Research. All contenders were evaluated on waterproofing, materials, durability, fit, features, price, and intended use. The brands that didn't get included offer great jackets as well, they just don't have the combination of unique features and audience-specific benefits needed to knock one of my picks off the list.</p>",157
39,compasses,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Selecting products for this review was a combination of reading what the experts had to say on the subject, comparing their conclusions, and looking at everything through the prism of my own experience with compasses and navigation.</p><p>In addition to expert reviews, I like to deep dive into the experiences of consumers. In other words, I feel I can make a more accurate assessment when I have access to 100 consumer reviews in addition to my own experiences. To round the process off, I like to reach out to others who have had first-hand experience with a product type or with a particular brand.</p><p>Luckily, this is a topic I have enough hands-on experience with that I have a pretty good idea of what makes sense and what doesn't. As always, I wish I had six months to field-test dozens of products and make my own first-hand assessments, but that just isn't reality.</p>",156
175,shooting gloves,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>There are tons of shooting and tactical glove offerings on the market. In order to compile this list, I researched and evaluated more than two dozen options compiled by scouring internet forums and Reddit, speaking with both active-duty and veteran U.S. service members, and discussing the important criteria of shooting gloves with competitive shooters that I shoot with regularly.</p><p>We ended up with this performance matrix, with what we decided was important, and compared the list of gloves to the five attributes on the Shooting Glove Performance Matrix: grip, feel, dexterity, insulation, and durability.</p><p>Based on reviews, hands-on experiences, and manufacturer-published data, I evaluated gloves based on these five categories. When I had the list narrowed down to the top two choices per category, I ordered the gloves and put them to the test to confirm my hypothesis. The gloves on this list will serve you well as long as you use them in the correct application.</p>",155
25,air mattresses for camping,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Since quality sleep has such a big impact on emotional regulation, mental health, and muscle recovery, comfort and weight were the top two criteria we considered when reviewing mattresses for camping. However, since there is nothing worse than rolling into a campsite in the dark and having to spend 30 minutes putting up your tent and setting up your bedding before being able to relax, we also considered ease of use and set up.</p><p>We also eliminated any mattresses that were too heavy or bulky to hike into a campsite from consideration since not all campsites allow direct access by car. We carefully considered the insulation value of each mattress we reviewed and only looked at those with an R-value of two or higher. Lastly, for consistency and comparison, we only refer to regular (versus long and wide) mattress size dimensions and weights when it comes to pricing.</p>",152
82,first aid kits,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Identifying a good first aid kit can be a challenge even for experienced individuals. Due to the diversity of needs of each reader, I looked for a kit contents list that was as comprehensive as possible in light of the kit's type, price range, and intended use. I took a close look at bonus features, like OSHA compliance and FSA/HSA eligibility, and supply quality, bypassing anything with suspect equipment, such as cheap or knock-off tourniquets. I also considered each kit's case design, looking at durability for the kit's intended use, internal organizational features, and overall size and weight. Throughout the process, I relied heavily on my own past knowledge and experience as a professional lifeguard and lifeguard trainer. When it came to understanding IFAKs, like the North American Rescue Solo IFAK, I took some queues from our own Travis Pike, combining his knowledge with my own.</p>",151
179,treadmills under 500,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Since there are a surprising number of options when it comes to buying a treadmill for under $500, we decided to narrow our picks based on a few factors. First, we only picked treadmills with a solid reputation for being a reliable product with stellar customer service. We also wanted to offer choices that got plenty of love from existing users and had minimal mechanical failures or malfunctions. We looked for treadmills that come backed by solid warranties, with the low end being one year and even on up to three years.</p><p>Next, we found treadmills that were space-saving and easy to maneuver, or even foldable, since most users will be in their homes. We also wanted a variety of different features to suit different tastes, including available incline adjustments, Bluetooth compatibility, heart rate monitoring, and more, since we know treadmills are definitely not a one-size-fits-all item.</p>",151
31,bedside gun safes,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Bedside gun safes are a niche product that serves as a middle ground between a simple lockbox and a fireproof, burglar-proof safe. Due to this unique role, we decided to focus on safes that provide a healthy balance between construction materials and quality, anchoring options, easy access, and resistance to attack. (We researched how easy these safes' locks were to pick or exploit.)</p><p>Special shoutouts to Handgun Safe Research and LockPickingLawyer. We also checked out hands-on reviews for each product before adding them to our list. We want to thank Bosnian Bill, Dean Safe, The Gun Zone, Hai Tran, LockPickingLawyer, Stealth Safes, and Talon Sei for documenting their experiences with each of these products, but a special shout out goes to Dave Goetzinger of Handgun Safe Research who provided tons of valuable information on the offerings from Fort Knox, Rhino Metals, ShotLock, Stealth Safes, and V-Line.</p>",150
214,tactical wallets,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Our guide to the best tactical wallets was primarily conducted through extensive research, with deep dives into manufacturer specs and, more importantly, consumer feedback. Our top picks were stout and durable pieces with actual, real-world practicality behind them, not just style with no substance. They have to be comfortable to carry and capable of holding all the items the average person will regularly need while proving they can withstand the strenuous work and active lifestyles many of our readers have. Items with abysmal build quality reports or little-to-no consumer input were binned in favor of items with a trusted backing that you and I could rely upon.</p><p>While Amazon continued to serve as a major hub for manufacturer and consumer information, a rainbow of worthwhile choices lays a few browser searches away from manufacturer-specific sites. 5.11 Tactical, Dango Products, and GRIP6 all deserve credit for their extensive catalogs.</p>",147
157,ballistic glasses,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>We started our search for the best ballistic glasses by making a list of the brands we know and trust. Are there up-and-coming manufacturers that make good eye pro? There probably are, but we'll let them cut their teeth on someone else's readers. Next, we factored in applicable safety standards. Safety glasses designed for civilian use are held to the ANSI Z87.1-2020 but might not be up to the realities of combat, so we only included glasses that meet the U.S. military's MIL-PRF-31013 standard for ballistic eye protection. Sticking to options that appear on the Army APEL is a safe bet (and some of our picks can be found on that list), but there are lots of options that are as good or better and are appropriate for wear in uniform, so we didn't confine ourselves to that list.</p>",144
19,iron sights,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>The concept of iron sights is simple, but there are multiple reasons to use them. We started by taking different needs into account - backup iron sights, competition sights, night sights, and offset sights for use alongside a magnified optic all had to be represented. We also considered which platforms would be most applicable to our readers. Sure, iron sights are common on handguns, most people who upgrade are probably doing so in favor of a red dot, not a different set of iron sights. If your handgun came with removable sights, they're probably pretty good to begin with. If you're in the market for a set of iron sights, you probably own some flavor of AR-15 with a Picatinny rail, so that's where we focused our attention, being careful to include proven contenders and new challengers.</p>",142
86,survival knives,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>All of these knives were tested through hands-on use in their intended roles - and then some. I'm a firm believer that you can't know how good something is until you've held it, used it, and seen where it fails you. These knives were selected using the criteria of availability, cost-effectiveness, usability, and reputation. I'm not going to recommend some obscure hipster knife that takes months of waiting to get, and at the same time I'm not going to recommend knives that are expensive for no reason, knives that are minimally practical, or knives that are from companies known for producing as many lemons as they do decent knives (looking at you, SOG.) Obviously, I couldn't cover every option, and you should feel free to let me know if you have a favorite that works for you.</p>",142
23,holsters for sig p365,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>How did we decide which holsters were worthy of your hard-earned cash? For this article, the main source we drew from was personal experience. I carry concealed more days than not, I've used holsters of myriad designs and materials, and I've spent a lot of time carrying in all of the most common carry positions, so these experiences inform the picks in this article.</p><p>For particular holsters or brands that we haven't had first-hand experience with, we did a deep dive into the manufacturer's websites to glean detailed information to determine the best holster for the SIG P365. Because the P365 is specifically designed for CCW, we focus on SIG P365 concealed-carry holsters more than other styles. Lastly, we crowdsourced reviews and included only the most consistently highly-rated contenders. Below is a list of criteria used to determine the winners.</p>",139
63,rain boots,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Since waterproofing is a critical element of a successful rain boot, we started there, but that was only the jumping-off point. Slick boots can cause you to hydroplane just like a car with bald tires, so we looked for boots that had tread patterns that encouraged water to escape from underfoot each time the wearer takes a step. Durability, overall weight, and comfort were also significant considerations, especially for work and hunting rain boots.</p><p>Since we could not get our feet into these boots for a full-on review, we checked out what others had to say about these boots. In addition to applying common sense to the process, we looked for trends in online customer reviews (Amazon's reviewers were especially helpful), but we read other hands-on reviews by the folks at OutdoorGearLab and ReviewYourGear.com.</p>",138
135,tourniquet,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When reviewing new gear, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes, a lack of resources may thwart our attempts to get our mitts on some cool gear. To make sure we don't let you down, we take the time to listen to those who have firsthand experience, combing through reviews on Amazon, professional publications, enthusiast blogs, and more to bring you the best intel available. We sift through it all, keep the gold, and toss the rest.</p><p>In addition to our own in-person handling of the North American Rescue Combat Application Tourniquet (C-A-T), Gen 7, we found the expertise from the folks at the Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care (CoTCCC), ITS Tactical, JEMS, OffGrid, Personal Defense Network, Pew Pew Tactical, and PrepMedic to be extremely helpful in completing this review.</p>",138
69,shooting ear protection,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Out of the myriad headsets that we evaluated, we distilled our selections down to our best overall, best budget, and best in-ear to capture the three major requirements that many shooters have for their hearing protection. We want to serve those who want to buy once and cry once, those who are on a budget, and those who live in extremely hot or humid environments or have other special considerations that would require them to have in-ear hearing protection. All of these options were tested by wearing them for prolonged periods, taking them to the range, and interviewing long-term users and subject-matter experts. The other options on this list are no less curated, they just fit into a much more niche capacity and therefore aren't going to be right for everyone.</p>",136
190,closet gun safes,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>For closet gun safes, we looked for options that maintain the security of your valuables, while also keeping down on size and weight. Given that I currently live in an apartment, researching a topic like this means looking for the kind of product that I myself would use. To that end, I pored over technical data to find the best options possible.</p><p>When I looked for gun safes, I used acceptable standards created by California's Department of Justice for guidance. The standards cover things like the locking mechanism, boltwork, construction, and hinges. Plus, it must meet Underwriters Laboratories standards, which cover things like fireproof ratings.</p><p>Typically, we would purchase the items ourselves. However, even closet-sized gun safes are bulky by nature, so we relied on reviews from end users to gather enough information to make the final decisions.</p>",136
60,night vision goggles,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>This gear guide was a serious undertaking, so we started by circling the wagons and combining our collective knowledge. We drew from collective experience in the military, law enforcement, firearms sales, and firearms journalism. We consulted leading experts to get a better understanding of what goes into night vision technology and how customers can be best served by various products. Of course, we also binge the same videos and articles you do. The resulting list is a selection of night vision products that knock value and performance out of the park. There are no knock-offs, questionable tubes, or too-good-to-be-true imitators here; just night vision devices we'd personally trust our lives to in the darkest hour. All of them feature third-generation or digital technology and are backed by a solid warranty.</p>",135
73,throwing knives,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When reviewing new gear, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes, a lack of resources may thwart our attempts to get our mitts on some cool gear. To make sure we don't let you down, we take the time to listen to those who have firsthand experience, combing through reviews on Amazon, professional publications, enthusiast blogs, and more to bring you the best intel available. We sift through it all, keep the gold, and toss the rest.</p><p>To complete this throwing knives guide, we did some extensive research to make sure we found the best the market has to offer. We gleaned some valuable information from A.G. Russell, American Knife Throwers Alliance, Axeing.org, Blade HQ, and Knife Informer and recommend you check out what they had to say.</p>",135
232,handheld gps,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As much as I trust and respect Garmin, I went out of my way to look for alternative brands that might get overlooked based on name recognition. The truth is that no other manufacturers can really go toe-to-toe with Garmin at the moment.</p><p>With that established, I conducted a virtual Garmin handheld GPS comparison to determine which ones were best for use in a military environment. I wanted to find products that you can trust in the field, then use to explore the world on your own time. Durability was obviously important in this process, but so was global usability. Finally, I looked for products across the price range because you shouldn't have to choose between the very best or nothing. There are great handheld GPS units for every budget, and that's what you see here.</p>",135
61,pocket knives,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>For this review, your gear writers here got their hands on each of these knives and put them through the wringer. We tested and tortured these knives over weeks, months, or even years, and the blades that managed to both survive and impress gained a hard-earned spot on this list.</p><p>When reviewing new gear, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes, a lack of resources may thwart our attempts to get our mitts on some cool gear. To make sure we don't let you down, we take the time to listen to those who have firsthand experience, combing through reviews on professional publications, enthusiast blogs, and more to bring you the best intel available. We sort through it all, keep the gold, and dump the rest. ",134
218,camping mugs,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>After choosing our price point ($30 and under), we excluded any mugs from consideration that were not explicitly designed for outdoor or mixed-use. Once we had that narrowed down, we compiled a large list of the best-reviewed and/or most popular brands available for purchase.</p><p>Those mugs were compared by cost, weight, liquid capacity, type of insulation, and material used. Any models that were similar to others but slightly inferior were removed from the review pool. For example, the Yeti Rambler is an incredibly well-known and popular brand, however, there are hundreds of copycats out there that offer nothing different aside from a lower price point and fewer features. Once the finalists were narrowed down, we used our personal experience with the mugs, along with manufacturer-provided data to arrive at the best choice per category.</p>",133
144,shoulder holsters,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>If you're in the market for a shoulder holster, you might be pickier than you would be for another style of carry. In addition to how the holster itself fits your handgun, you need to take into account how the rig fits your body. We looked for diverse options that can satisfy a range of needs. We looked for all-leather options, Kydex options, those with and without magazine storage, and even attachments for shoulder holsters. We included different styles of retention so you can find something that works with your draw. Unfortunately, there are a lot of shoddy products out there that shouldn't be trusted with securing a firearm. We limited our picks to the manufacturers and systems we trust, so you can buy with confidence.</p>",131
184,hunting backpacks,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Hunting backpacks span a wide range of hunt types, so for the sake of simplicity, we focused our search on packs designed specifically for multi-day, backcountry big game pursuits (think Rocky Mountain elk or Alaska moose). That said, we made sure to touch on packs for less strenuous outings, such as a tree stand whitetail hunt.</p><p>In addition to looking for quiet, weather-resistant bags, we looked for packs that would endure heavy loads year after year without breaking down. This meant a pack built with tough materials, robust stitching, and a durable weight-bearing frame. We also emphasized wearer comfort, since an awkward, sore spot-inducing backpack is a not-so-great way to cut short the hunt of a lifetime. Weight, cargo capacity, organization, and accessibility also played a significant role in determining a winner.</p>",131
227,camping tables,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>It's nice to spend less when you can, but not at the expense of getting a decent product. Unfortunately, we found dozens of camping tables and most of them come from brands we've never heard of that raise a lot of questions about quality. A quick Amazon search yielded seven pages - about 64 results - and a lot of the tables looked like rebranded generic products pumped out of the same anonymous factory. To protect your investment, I stuck to a few brands with reliable track records of success. I prioritized products with enough information about materials and construction that I felt like I had a good idea of what would show up in the mail. The three I ended up with are the ones I'd be most confident buying.</p>",131
149,trauma shears,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Picking a pair of trauma shears isn't something to take lightly, so in compiling this list, I made sure to scrutinize every possible pick before it made it onto this list. To start, I evaluated every product's list of features - size, blade steel, blade finish, and autoclave compatibility - to determine its long-term advantages and drawbacks. I noted price tags, researched steel finishes, and scoured the interwebs for reviews by healthcare professionals and other real-world users. (Shout outs to Acme United Corporation, IBC Coatings Technologies, Inside First Aid, PrepMedic (times two), and SkinnyMedic!) Finally, I tallied the scores and found the winners. Cheap, weak, and flaky shears fell by the wayside, but those who survived the gauntlet truly earned their spot on this list.</p>",130
133,tactical sunglasses,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When reviewing new gear, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes, a lack of resources may thwart our attempts to get our mitts on some cool gear. To make sure we don't let you down, we take the time to listen to those who have firsthand experience, combing through reviews on Amazon, professional publications, enthusiast blogs, and more to bring you the best intel available. We sift through it all, keep the gold, and toss the rest.</p><p>Adding to our own hands-on experience with tactical sunglasses like the Wiley X Saint (a smaller version of the Valor), we received plenty of valuable input from the good people at Safety Glasses USA, SportRx, Oakley Forum, Officer.com, PEO Soldier, and The Firearm Blog.</p>",128
207,headlamps for hunting,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>As is the case with all of my gear guides, I first put myself in the mindset of someone who needs the best headlamp for hunting they can possibly get. That can mean a few different things, but everyone deserves a quality item from a reputable manufacturer. That's where I began my search; companies that have a proven track record of building reliable gear. Next, I filtered out products that aren't able to work in bad weather. Not every hunting headlamp needs to be totally waterproof, but some degree of weather protection is essential. Finally, I gave preference to headlights that feature multiple power output settings so you can have the right amount of light for every job. This wasn't a make-or-break criterion, but it was a consideration.</p>",128
7,camping lanterns,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>To make this gear guide as strong as possible, we sought out camping lanterns that work in a wide range of environments. Want something for your trailer camper? No problem. Need a sustainable light source for your hiking adventure or go bag? We have you covered. Only reliable products with a proven record of success made the cut. To account for everyone's needs, we chased down the best options for car camping, backpacking, and emergency use. We included options that run on disposable and rechargeable batteries, solar power, manual power, and traditional fuels like white gas, kerosene, and gasoline. Of course, we also care about finding products that suit different budgets. We've got lanterns here ranging from $10 to $100.</p>",125
126,safety glasses,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When reviewing new gear, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes, a lack of resources may thwart our attempts to get our mitts on some cool gear. To make sure we don't let you down, we take the time to listen to those who have firsthand experience, combing through reviews on Amazon, professional publications, enthusiast blogs, and more to bring you the best intel available. We sift through it all, keep the gold, and toss the rest.</p><p>In putting together this guide on safety glasses, we relied heavily on our own experiences with the Smith & Wesson Major, Wiley X Saint, and other offerings. We also found the input from the folks at SportRx to be quite helpful.</p>",125
213,canvas backpacks,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Deciding which backpacks made the cut was not an easy task. To decide on which backpacks were worthy and which weren't, several things were taken into consideration including brand reliability, materials used, whether the material was waxed or not, and above all, customer reviews. A few notable reviews that were key to the decision-making include pieces from Engearment, Pack Hacker, GentCreate, and Outdoors Magic.</p><p>Additionally, Fjallraven was chosen as the sustainable pick because of the company's sustainable approach towards materials and its guides to fixing its products, as well as the fact that you can take its bags to a physical storefront, drop the bag off, and have it repaired. In my mind, that's an excellent step towards keeping slightly damaged materials out of the dump.</p>",125
54,hiking shorts,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Since comfort, function, and moisture-wicking are critical when choosing a pair of hiking shorts, we started there. But we also considered several other features, such as UPF protection, water repellency, and overall durability. Fit is vital when choosing clothing for hiking, trekking, and backpacking adventures, so we made sure to choose products that aren't too snug or too loose and provide good freedom of movement, whether you're walking on flat terrain or climbing boulders. Since we couldn't get our hands on these hiking shorts for a full-on review, we looked at what others had to say about them. We examined trends and found the hiking shorts in this list rose to the top due to their various features.</p>",123
59,long range scopes,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Selecting a long-range scope can be quite a challenge thanks to the market's massive selection. To help reduce variables, we reached out to the experts, and the feedback they provided allowed us to narrow down our list of critical features. We narrowed down our list of essentials to the following: strong all-around performance, magnification range, first focal plane reticle, high mechanical precision, quality optical clarity, toughness, reliability/repeatability, and overall value (performance-to-price ratio). We also curated a list of nice-to-have elements that influenced our final scope selections, although these factors carried less weight in the final tally. This secondary list included elements such as mechanical zero reset, reticle selection (pattern, illumination, MOA vs. MRAD, etc.), and minimum parallax range.</p>",123
33,camping food,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I've been an outdoorsman for more than 35 years. I'm an avid long-distance backpacker, rock climber, and mountaineer, so I understand the value of well-designed gear. I don't get paid by the manufacturers and have editorial independence. My editor leaves it to me to recommend and prints what I write. All of this enables me to provide you, our valued readers, with our unvarnished, honest opinions on the recommendations we make.</p><p>All the foods in this review were selected based on personal consumption, interviewing other experts, and thoroughly reviewing manufacturers' specifications. We take our time to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of each item and also check out the reviews of other experts just to make sure we're not missing anything.</p>",122
79,6 person tents,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>In order to pick our favorite six-person tents, we considered which product excels in each category, looking at features such as spaciousness, weather capabilities, and features. We identified products great for families looking to car camp once a summer on a budget, as well as groups looking to camp all year round in rain, snow, or shine. Since my tents have largely come from REI Co-op, I can attest to their quality, but for other brands, I looked towards product reviews and other experts to identify my other top picks. I made sure to look at several sources for each product, including GearLab, the New York Times' Wirecutter, The Wise Adventurer, Camping Maniacs, Switchback Travel, and more.</p>",122
172,molle pouches,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>I chose these magazine pouches based on my experiences with pouches that I have personally owned and used. Every single pouch on this list has been on my kit in some form or another at some point in time. I left several other options off, since they either didn't measure up, didn't offer anything that the ones I included don't have, or were too niche to be of much use to most of my readers. However, because of the fact that these choices are based on my experiences, my selection is limited. If you want to see my take on any of your favorite pouches, you can find my social media in the header of this article.</p>",122
235,rolling backpacks,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>Our guide to the best rolling backpacks has been primarily curated through extensive research, diving deep into manufacturer specs and, more importantly, real-world ownership experiences. The best products were durable, reliable, and superbly capable luggage items that can be used anywhere, with focus shifting as categories called for a more honed-in skillset, such as children or airline travel. Products with little-to-no feedback or egregious quality control were binned in favor of rolling backpacks you and I could easily trust.</p><p>Amazon primarily served as our key encyclopedia of consumer input and specs due to the higher density of needed information. Note that some entries and their variants can also be purchased from Target and Walmart or manufacturer sites such as J World and Matein.</p>",122
191,rain ponchos,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>The process we use to recommend the absolute best products relies on a mix of our team's personal experience, external expert opinions, product research, and user reviews. I've pointed out in previous guides that I've spent a lot of time doing outdoor activities like camping, backpacking, and hiking, so I've had to plan for all sorts of weather contingencies.</p><p>The fundamental job of a poncho is to protect the wearer from rain, so that was the starting point for inclusion in this list. Durability and functionality were also considered, but were weighted differently depending on the category (e.g., the best disposable poncho didn't have to impress me with multifunctional capabilities, while the best lightweight poncho didn't have to be the most durable).</p>",121
147,tent stakes,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Tent stakes are all about the physics of anchoring, so we started with the science first. Armed with an understanding of what features are most necessary, we proceeded to track down suitable candidates. Shortlisting those made out of durable materials, with enough reach to anchor well, we then moved onto the design. Aiming for affordable selections that are compatible with most tents, we whittled down the list to only the best. The final criteria was ease of use, narrowing our list down to only the best tent stakes. Incorporating user reviews, the companies' history, and firsthand experience, we completed the roundup. The result is a series of stakes that will keep your tent in place.</p>",120
76,waterproof backpacks,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Every single piece of gear we recommend needs to perform as promised and represent a good use of your hard-earned money. If something sucks, we'll tell you. To get our hands on the best waterproof backpacks, we hit up trusted brands like Sea to Summit, Yeti, and Mountain Hardwear. To avoid blind spots, we also brought in lesser-known manufacturers like Matador and fashion-forward brands like Fjallraven. Since there are many different reasons to buy a waterproof backpack, we targeted bags designed for everything from everyday wear to wilderness adventures. We included roll-top and zip-closure bags for those of you who have a preference. In other words, we chose gear we personally want to use.</p>",119
101,american made pocket knives,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When reviewing new outdoor products, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes a lack of resources may prevent us from trying out the outdoor equipment in person. To make sure we don't let you down, we take the time to thoroughly research and review other professionals who have hands-on experience with the equipment, combing through extensive reviews on Amazon, professional publications, outdoor enthusiast blogs, and more to bring you the best information available. For this review, we found the information at Hi Consumption, All American Reviews, American Gear Guide, Blade Reviews, and Home Stratosphere to be extremely helpful when shopping for the best American-made pocket knives for your next outdoor trip.</p>",119
116,gaiter mask,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When reviewing new outdoor products, we much prefer to go the hands-on route, but sometimes a lack of resources may prevent us from trying out the outdoor equipment in person.

26,4 person tents,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>When choosing our favorite four-person tents, we first considered which product excels in each category, looking at features such as spaciousness, comfort level, and accessories. We identified products that fit the needs of families looking to car camp in warm weather, along with families hoping to hit the trails, minimize weight, and gain protection from the elements. I have used tents from REI Co-op and can attest to their quality, but when it came to other brands, I looked towards product reviews and other experts to identify my other top picks. I made sure to look at several sources for each product, including GearLab, New York Times' Wirecutter, Wilderness Times, Adventure, and more.</p>",118
35,camping grills,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>Based on the amount of time we've spent using various grills, you could say this article was years in the making. We took that knowledge with us to search the marketplace for the best camping grills you can buy right now. We prioritized function above all else because if you can't count on a grill to work properly, it doesn't belong anywhere near this list. The recent boom in demand for camping grills has resulted in a surprising amount of innovation, so we sought out grills that provide creative solutions to old problems. As always, the final cut came down to which ones we'd personally want to fire up at our own campsite.</p>",118

We turned to the best brands in the business to find a great solution for everyone. Whether you want something that can tag along during a deployment, get you to the campsite every weekend, or ride shotgun in your car every day, there's something here for you.</p>",118
174,plasma lighters,"<h2>How we chose our top picks</h2><p>There are a lot of plasma lighters on the market, but many of them are the same product repackaged and sold by multiple vendors. That's why our pick for best value, the TG plasma lighter, looks so familiar to other options on the market. It works well and doesn't cost much, which is all you need in most situations. Our other picks are more specialized and come with features that help them stand out from the crowd. We sought out high-quality plasma lighters to get the job done in camping, survival, and everyday situations. The ones that made the list vary in design and function, so you can find exactly what you need.</p>",118
95,owb holsters,"<h2>Methodology</h2><p>I've packed a mohaska in an OWB rig for over a decade and for various purposes. I've strapped an M9 to my side for trips worldwide, stuck a P365 there for daily carry, and tossed on my custom P320 to (try to) bring home gold. My experience with OWB holsters goes far and wide, and I've got a box full of holsters to prove it.</p><p>Choosing good holsters can be challenging, and with so many out there, you might wonder how we came up with our picks. It's a valid question, and we used a combination of experiences from our brain trust. Our top picks offered the most versatile combination of features paired with safety, security, and access.</p>",117
