8,garage heater,"<p>After becoming familiar with the best garage heaters, there may be some lingering questions about the type of heater, efficiency, and the appropriate size of heater for the garage. Below are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about garage heaters to help clear up these inquiries.</p> <h3>Q. What type of heater is best for a garage?</h3> <p>The best type of heater for the garage depends on your needs. Large garages benefit from a natural gas or propane heater because of the high heating capacity, allowing the heater to adequately warm the space. However, an electric garage heater is a safer alternative and the heating capacity is suitable for smaller garages.</p> <h3>Q. What size heater do I need for my 2-car garage?</h3> <p>Depending on where you live, the answer to this question can vary. Areas with mild winters will naturally require less heat production to warm a space than locations with harsh, freezing winters.</p> <p>However, an electric garage heater with 3,000 watts is usually needed to heat a two-car garage. The best gas garage heater for a two-car garage usually has a rating of about 18,000 BTUs to adequately heat the space.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most efficient garage heater?</h3> <p>Efficiency can be difficult to determine because an electric infrared heater technically has 100 percent efficiency, but it may actually cost more to operate than the best natural gas garage heater. This is due to the cost of electricity over natural gas or even propane. If you are looking for a heater that uses almost every watt of energy for heating, then an infrared heater can be the best option.</p> <h3>Q. Can a garage heater be too big?</h3> <p>Yes, a garage heater can be too big. If it is too big, the excess heat produced quickly makes the garage feel uncomfortable, forcing you to open the door to release some heat. If you have a smaller garage, consider using a portable heater to keep the space warm.</p> <h3>Q. Will a 1,500-watt heater heat a garage?</h3> <p>It depends on the size of the garage. Typically a good estimate for electric heaters is that for every 10 watts of output, the heater can warm up approximately 1 square foot of space. This means that as long as the garage is 150 square feet or smaller, a 1,500-watt heater is more than adequate.</p> <h3>Q. Where should a heater be placed in the garage?</h3> <p>Portable garage heaters can be placed anywhere in the garage. Fixed or mounted garage heaters should be installed in the coldest corner of the garage, directing the heat and airflow toward the center of the garage. Make sure that heaters are installed at least 24 inches away from the walls, and always check the manufacturer’s directions for use to make sure that you are installing the unit properly.</p>",470
9,electric garage heater,"<p>Below are some answers to commonly asked questions about electric garage heaters.</p> <h3>Q. Where should I place my garage heater?</h3> <p>You can place portable electric garage heaters anywhere you want. If they aren’t giving you the heat and results you want, just move them. Fixed or mounted electric garage heaters that have a forced-air or ceramic-heating function should be installed in the coldest corner of the garage with the air directed toward the center of the room.</p> <p>Fixed or mounted electric garage heaters that use infrared or radiant heating need to be positioned at least 24 inches from the walls of the garage to ensure that they do not cause a fire. Measure and mark out this safety zone, then select an area within the zone that is close to your usual work space so you can benefit the most from the heater when it is installed.</p> <h3>Q. How many watts do I need to heat my garage?</h3> <p>The type of heater, the layout of your garage, the contents of your garage, and the ambient temperature are all factors that can make this a difficult measurement to pinpoint, but a basic rule to follow is approximately 10 watts for every square foot of space that you want to heat.</p> <h3>Q. How much does it cost to run an electric garage heater?</h3> <p>This depends heavily on your local electrical costs, the wattage of the electric heater, and how long the heater has been used. However, on average, a 1,500-watt electric space heater will cost between $0.18 and $0.25 per hour to use.</p>",261
10,garage fan,"<p>Now that you know about some of the garage fan options out there, here are a few of the most common questions about these products.</p> <h3>Q: Where should a fan be placed in a garage?</h3> <p>Wall-mounted fans that are placed in high places and face away from the wall in a garage offer temperature regulation and remove particles from the air effectively.</p> <p>Floor-mounted fans distribute air horizontally throughout the garage, which cools the room. They are portable enough to achieve air circulation wherever needed.</p> <h3>Q: When is the best time to buy a fan?</h3> <p>When working with lumber or noxious chemicals on a project, a fan can help reduce the fumes, dust, and particles in the garage. A fan is also a good investment for anyone planning to work in a garage in the summer heat. The best time to buy a fan is usually in the fall, once the hot weather is past.</p> <h3>Q: How much power should a garage fan have?</h3> <p>Garage fans should have high velocity and power of 3,000 to 6,000 CFM. The average one-car garage can rely on a 3,000-to-4,000 CFM fan for air distribution, while larger garages should employ a 4,000-to-6,000 CFM fan.</p>",199
11,garage cabinets,"<p>Before buying a new garage cabinet, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers.</p> <h3>Q: How high should I mount my garage cabinet?</h3> <p>This depends on your preference and should be based on your garage layout and height. The standard mounting height for cabinets is approximately 8 feet, measured from the floor to the top of the cabinet.</p> <h3>Q: How deep should a garage cabinet be?</h3> <p>The average depth of a garage cabinet ranges from 16 inches to 36 inches, but this depends on how you plan to use your cabinet.</p> <h3>Q: How do you attach a cabinet to a garage wall? </h3> <p>To hang a garage cabinet on the wall, follow these basic steps. Refer to the manufacturer’s directions as well to ensure you install your cabinet properly.</p> <ol><li>Plan where you wish to  hang the cabinet, then measure from the floor to the desired height of the cabinet.</li><li>Draw a horizontal line (using a level) to mark where the bottom of the cabinet will sit. This is your hanging line.</li><li>Use a stud finder along the hanging line to locate studs. Screw in a ledger board underneath the hanging line to balance and level your cabinet during installation.</li><li>Lift the cabinet onto the ledger board, which should support the weight of the cabinet.</li><li>Drill holes into the wall studs. Screw the cabinets to the studs, ensuring the entire frame of the cabinet has adequate support.</li><li>Check that the cabinet is level, then remove the ledger board.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How do I declutter and organize my garage cabinet?</h3> <p>Declutter your garage cabinet by sorting your items into two piles: keep and toss. Once they’re sorted, get rid of the items in the “toss” pile and organize the remaining ones in the cabinet. The goal is to be able to find the tool you need without having to dig through piles of miscellaneous items.</p>",309

15,garage refrigerator,"<p>If you’re considering adding a refrigerator kit to a standard refrigerator for garage use, or if you’re wondering if it’s OK to put your refrigerator in the garage, then read on for answers.</p> <h3>Q. Is it OK to put a refrigerator in the garage?</h3> <p>Only if the refrigerator is rated for garage use. Since a garage is an unfinished space, temperatures inside can fluctuate from near freezing temps to extreme heat. A standard refrigerator is not designed to manage such extreme changes in ambient temperature and is therefore more likely to malfunction when faced with cold or heat.</p> <h3>Q. Do garage refrigerator kits work?</h3> <p>A garage refrigerator kit consists of a heating coil that warms the air around the refrigerator’s thermostat. This device tricks the refrigerator into thinking the surrounding air is warm so it turns the compressor on, preventing the freezer from thawing out when the air temperature around it is hovering around freezing. The kits do work; however, they will not help a refrigerator that’s working overtime in the extreme heat of the summer keep its interior contents cold.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a special fridge for the garage?</h3> <p>Yes. Make sure to get a garage-ready refrigerator. A standard refrigerator can only handle temperature ranges of about 50 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit without malfunctioning or overworking. Garage-ready refrigerators are designed to work in spaces that aren’t climate controlled with broader operating temperature ranges of 32 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <h3>Q. Should I unplug my garage refrigerator in the winter?</h3> <p>Cold weather can cause a standard refrigerator to stop working properly by forcing the fridge’s thermostat to an extremely low temperature, which shuts off the compressor and can lead to spoiled food.</p>",283
16,plunger,"<p>When it comes to plungers, it always pays to be prepared. With the appropriate plunger on hand, you can clear blockages before they become a costlier issue. As an inexpensive and effective solution for most sink and toilet clogs, plungers are a necessity in any home. Read on for some frequently asked questions and answers about choosing and using a new plunger.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between a cup plunger and a flange plunger?</h3> <p>Flange plungers have a narrowed protruding tube at the end of the plunger cup that can help create a better seal, especially for plunging toilets.</p> <h3>Q: Can a plunger be too small?</h3> <p>Although uncommon, it is possible for a plunger to be too small, such as on a larger toilet or shower drain. If your drain is larger than average, take the plunger size into account before buying.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a plunger on a tub?</h3> <p>Absolutely! The PlumbCraft Mini Home Plunger is one of the best options to plunge sinks, tubs, and showers.

17,drain cleaner,"<p>For more information on the benefits and drawbacks of drain cleaners, as well as tips to help reduce drain clogs, take a look at some of the most commonly asked questions and the answers below.</p> <h3>Q: What clogs drains the most?</h3> <p>Many different substances can clog a drain; however, hair, soap, grease, fat, and oil are the most common. Tree roots are responsible for most drain clogs outside the home.</p> <h3>Q: Do vinegar and baking soda clean drains? </h3> <p>Vinegar and baking soda don’t clean drains, at least not any better than using boiling water and dish soap. Since baking soda is a base and vinegar is an acid, mixing them creates a chemical reaction that produces water, carbon dioxide, and sodium acetate, which has an almost neutral pH level. It lacks any cleaning properties that could efficiently eliminate grease.</p> <h3>Q: Can drain cleaners damage pipes?</h3> <p>Yes, drain cleaners can damage the pipes, though it depends on the type of cleaner. Caustic and acidic drain cleaners are harsh solutions that are highly effective at clearing clogs, but they can damage older plastic and metal pipes. Both cleaners seem safe for newer (within the past 20 years) plastic and copper pipes. If you have older plumbing, consider using an enzymatic cleaner to avoid damaging the pipes.</p> <h3>Q: Can drain cleaners reduce odor?</h3> <p>Drain cleaners generally reduce odors because they help clear clogs and eliminate foul-smelling waste from the insides of pipes. However, since drain cleaners can damage your pipes, only resort to a caustic or acidic drain cleaner when an actual clog is present, not just a bad odor.</p> <h3>Q: How do I stop hair from clogging the drain?</h3> <p>The best way to stop a hair clog from forming is to use a drain cover. Routine cleaning and maintenance help prevent sticky grime and sludge from coating the walls of pipes.</p> <h3>Q: Will shaving in the shower clog the drain?</h3> <p>Shaving can cause or exacerbate a clog, especially if you use a thick shaving cream or high-lather soap. When you shave, rinse with hot water to help dissolve the soap residue left behind.</p>",351
18,rv sewer hoses,"<p>If you’re wondering how long your sewer hose should be or if any sewer hose will work with your rig, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions about RV sewer hoses.</p> <h3>Q. How long should an RV sewer hose be?</h3> <p>That depends on the positioning of the RV’s drainpipe. For trailers or motor homes with drainpipes on the side of the RV, 15 feet should suffice. For those with drainpipes at the center of the rear of the RV, go with a longer 20-foot hose.</p> <h3>Q. Are RV sewer hoses universal?</h3> <p>For the most part, yes. RV sewer hoses are designed to fit standard 3-inch RV drainpipes, which covers all newer RVs and motor homes. Older RVs may use a different-size drainpipe, which requires an adapter to work with a 3-inch RV waste hose.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean an RV sewer hose?</h3> <p>Most RV dump stations are equipped with a freshwater spigot. Attach a hose to this spigot and use it to run fresh water through the hose to flush it out. As a rule of thumb, always dump your black water tank before dumping your gray water tanks. By doing this, you can rinse the hose with soapy gray water once the black water tank is empty.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I replace my RV sewer hose?</h3> <p>Replace an RV sewer hose about every 3 years to ensure it doesn’t break or puncture while in use. Full-time RVers should replace them every 2 years.</p> <h3>Q. Can I hook two RV sewer hoses together?</h3> <p>Yes. In fact, some kits are designed to work this way. Just make sure the two hoses connect using a bayonet-style fitting to ensure they do not leak or blow off while in use.</p> <h3>Q. What size is a standard RV sewer hose?</h3> <p>A standard RV sewer hose is 3 inches in diameter.</p>",313

What cleaning supplies do I need for my bathroom?</h3> <p>To keep the bathroom clean, cleaning supplies usually include a toilet brush, toilet bowl cleaner, a bathroom cleaner, a scrub brush, a glass cleaner for the mirror or window, a sponge, a cloth, a broom with a dustpan, and some clean rags or paper towels.</p> <h3>Q.

Begin by clearing away any garbage or clutter in the bathroom, then use a brush to clean loose debris from inside the toilet and a broom to gather any dirt or hair from the ground.</p> <p>When the floor and counters don’t have loose dirt or hair on them any longer, use a bathroom cleaner, a cloth, and a scrub brush to clean and wipe down all surfaces, including the toilet, sink, bathtub, shower, floor, and walls.

20,drain snakes,"<p>Drain snakes are simple tools, but they must be used properly so that clearing a drain is an easy task. Keep reading for information about how a drain snake works, what type of snakes are used by professionals, and gain answers to other common questions about these plumbing tools,</p> <h3>Q: How does snaking a drain work?</h3> <p>Instead of using a plunger to force water and air through the pipes, a drain snake is a physical tool that is fed into the drain. When the snake encounters a clog, it is rotated against the obstruction to break it up or grab the mass and pull it out.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of snakes do plumbers use?</h3> <p>Typically, professional plumbers will have more than one snake. These include short, toothed drain snakes for removing hair clogs, standard metal drain snakes that can take care of most nearby clogs, and powerful electric drain snakes that can reach 50 feet in length to banish clogs buried in the middle of the drain system.</p> <h3>Q: How do you unclog a drain with a snake?</h3> <p>Snaking a drain is a relatively simple process. Insert the snake into the drain, slowly feeding it further into the system until the snake encounters resistance. At this point, rotate the snake against the blockage until the flexible cable can be fed freely through the pipes.</p> <p>If the blockage doesn’t break up, try to pull the snake out slowly. It’s likely that solid blockages can be entangled with the snake, allowing the debris to be pulled out of the drain instead of forced down. After removing the snake, run the water full force for a few minutes to confirm that the blockage has been removed or broken up.</p> <h3>Q: How do you get a snake past the P trap?</h3> <p>There are a few ways to get past the P trap in the drainage system. A thin, flexible snake won’t have much difficulty maneuvering around tight corners.  If such a snake isn’t firm enough to break up heavy clogs, try a thick snake with a hand crank or mechanical crank function that physically twists the snake so that it can be directed down the correct path.</p> <p>If these options fail, consider removing the P trap to insert the snake beyond this problem spot. Then replace the P trap once the pipes have been snaked.</p> <h3>Q: How often should you snake your drain?</h3> <p>It’s advised to snake the drain at least once a year to help reduce the potential for clogs.</p>",417
21,showerhead,"<p>There is a lot to consider when choosing a new shower head. If you still have questions about shower heads, then the following section may help. Check out these answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about shower heads.</p> <h3>Q: What should I look for in a shower head?</h3> <p>If replacing an existing shower head, try to match the color and finish to current bathroom fixtures. For those who want to save on their water bills, pay attention to the GPM. Do you want cool features like LED lights? Do a specific search for those. The two main features are type and spray because although looks are important, how you feel every time you step in the shower will ultimately win out as the priority.</p> <h3>Q: Can a shower head increase water pressure?</h3> <p>Yes. High-pressure shower heads can increase the water pressure.</p> <h3>Q: What is a good psi for a shower head?</h3> <p>In the U.S., the standard psi is between 45 and 55 pounds per square inch.</p> <h3>Q: How much does a water-efficient shower head save?</h3> <p>By reducing shower time by 2 to 3 minutes and using a shower head with a 2.5 flow rate, a family of four could save up to 2,300 gallons of water per year.</p> <h3>Q: What is the most water efficient shower head?</h3> <p>The best high-efficiency shower head is the High Sierra’s High Efficiency Low Flow Showerhead.</p>",234
22,toilet bowl cleaner,"<p>If you still want more information about buying and using the best toilet cleaner, consider the answers to these commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Are toilet bowl cleaners safe?</h3> <p>When cleaners are properly used, they are safe. However, before using any cleaner, make sure it’s suitable for the toilet’s surface and your plumbing system. Read labels to see if the product contains chemical ingredients to which you may be allergic or sensitive. When using a bleach-based cleaner, ventilate the area and wear appropriate protective cleaning gear or opt for a natural alternative.</p> <h3>Q: How do I keep my toilet clean naturally?</h3> <p>There are many effective toilet cleaners on the market made from natural ingredients. Cleaners such as Better Life Natural Toilet Bowl Cleaner uses citric and lactic acid derived from plants and essential oils to remove stains.</p> <h3>Q: What is lime buildup?</h3> <p>Lime is a white, chalky, hard substance composed of calcium and carbonate ions found in hard water. It’s commonly found on and around toilet bowls, sinks, taps, bathroom tiles, and inside washing machines and kettles.</p> <h3>Q: How do I get rid of limescale and soap scum?</h3> <p>A cleaner designed to remove hard water stains such as CLR PRO Calcium, Lime and Rust Remover will effectively remove limescale and soap scum. Apply the cleaner directly to the stain with a brush, cloth, or sponge and let soak for two minutes. Rinse promptly with cold water.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use toilet cleaner for other applications?</h3> <p>Toilet cleaner should only be used for cleaning toilets and not as a general purpose bathroom cleaner. Most of them contain bleach or other disinfecting ingredients and acids that dissolve limescale and soap scum. These ingredients are harmless in your toilet but can damage the finish on other surfaces.</p>",293
23,bathroom fan,"<p>There are many benefits of adding a bathroom fan to your bathroom, but you may still have some questions about choosing the right fan for your space. Refer to the frequently asked questions below to gain more knowledge to help you make the best selection.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a ventilation fan and an exhaust fan?</h3> <p>Ventilation fans and exhaust fans both share the goal of leaving the air in a space cleaner and fresher, but the way they go about reaching this goal is different. Ventilation fans pull cleaner air into spaces from the exterior, while exhaust fans remove pollutants and other contaminants from the air in a space.</p> <h3>Q: What CFM do I need for a bathroom fan?</h3> <p>To determine the CFM (cubic feet per minute) needed for your bathroom, consider the square footage of the space. The CFM should be at least as high as this number, so a 100-square-foot bathroom will require a fan with a rating of at least 100 CFM. For greater precision, use the following formula to make sure you choose the right fan for your bathroom: Length x Width x Height x 0.13 = Suggested CFM.</p> <h3>Q: Do bathroom exhaust fans have to be vented outside?</h3> <p>When installing a bathroom fan, it is important to vent it to the outside, either through the attic or a sidewall. If bath fans are not vented outside, you’ll simply be moving the moisture to another area in the home, where it may cause problems.</p> <h3>Q: Can you run a bathroom fan all the time?</h3> <p>Running a bathroom fan all the time is not a good idea. If the fan is run for too long, it can cause the motor to wear down or even pose a potential fire hazard. Run the fan for about 20 minutes after bathing or showering to allow it to do its job and remove the moisture from the room, then turn the fan off.</p> <h3>Q: How long should you run the bathroom fan after a shower?</h3> <p>The Home Ventilating Institute recommends running a bathroom fan for about 20 minutes after showering. This amount of time will allow for proper bathroom ventilation and prevent moisture from lingering and causing issues.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

24,toilet plunger,"<p>That’s a lot of plunger information to take in, so you might have some lingering questions. This section aims to unclog the mind with answers to the most frequently asked questions about toilet plungers.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best way to plunge a toilet?</h3> <p>The first step in plunging a toilet is to ensure that the water level inside the toilet bowl is high but not so high that it will overflow. Next, place the head of the plunger into the water at an angle so it may fill with water. Next, place the plunger over the drain and apply pressure to form a seal. Then, push the handle in and out multiple times to push the clog through or pull it back into the bowl.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of plunger do plumbers use?</h3> <p>Professional plumbers use a variety of plungers. Many use beehive or accordion styles, while others may use air-powered plungers. However, most pros prefer to use a device known as a closet snake, which is specially designed to clear clogs in toilets.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of plunger do you use for an elongated toilet?</h3> <p>A universal-fit plunger is typically best for elongated toilets, but these can still be a challenge to create a seal around. To help, place a bit of petroleum jelly around the flange of the plunger to create a better seal.</p> <h3>Q. Can you unclog a toilet without a plunger?</h3> <p>Plungers aren’t always available, so it may be necessary to clear a clog with another method. While these methods will work, the preferred plunger-less method includes using a closet snake.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use Drano in a toilet?</h3> <p>Drano is really a drain maintenance tool, not a clog-buster. Only use it in slow-draining drains. When it comes to a toilet clog, the Drano will collect on the clog and do very little, and it will be dangerous for the plumber or person who inevitably comes along to plunge it.</p>",324
25,caulk for shower or bathtub,"<p>While the hands-on reviews can be extremely helpful for many shopping for shower caulk, every situation is different. Often specific questions arise, so below are answers to some of the most popular questions about caulk for showers and tubs.</p> <h3>Q. Is there a difference between caulk and sealant?</h3> <p>Yes, there is a difference. Although the terms are used interchangeably, caulk and sealant differ in elasticity. Both fill cracks or seams, but caulk is more rigid and sealant is more flexible. Sealant can hold up better in areas where materials expand and contract.</p> <h3>Q. Do you caulk the inside of a shower enclosure?</h3> <p>You should caulk any areas of the shower enclosure where water can get in, and especially when the existing caulk begins to crack or crumble.</p> <p>Q. How do I keep my shower caulking white?</p> <p>The best way to keep shower caulking white is to make sure it has no cracks to let mildew in. Keep the caulk clean and scrub stubborn stains off with a soft brush like a toothbrush. To clean naturally, try a paste of baking soda mixed with water or vinegar, or use bleach or your regular bathroom cleaner. A caulk or grout pen can hide some stains that remain after cleaning.</p> <h3>Q. Is black mold in shower caulk dangerous?</h3> <p>Any sign of mold or mildew on or around shower caulk is a sign that water can be getting through. Clean it thoroughly and evaluate the existing caulk to see if it needs replacing, taking proper safety precautions when removing the moldy caulk.</p> <h3>Q. How do you prevent mold in shower caulking?</h3> <p>If mold is a problem in a shower, choose a silicone sealant for the best chance of keeping water and mildew out. Ventilate the bathroom to remove moisture from the air when showering and re-caulk as needed to make sure water does not seep through cracks in the caulk.</p>",316
26,shower curtains,"<p>There is a lot to consider when choosing a new shower curtain. If you still have questions about shower curtains, the following section may help. Check out these answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about shower curtains.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a shower curtain?</h3> <p>Consider your current decor and how you want the bathroom to all come together. Do you want a neutral solid-colored shower curtain because the bathroom already includes many patterns, or do you want to make the curtain the focal point of the room? Remember to measure and purchase the correct size. Take into account who uses the shower and which material is appropriate.</p> <h3>Q: Is a fabric or plastic shower curtain better?</h3> <p>A fabric shower curtain like canvas, cotton, hemp, and linen is both eco-friendly and luxurious looking. These fabrics are easily laundered according to the manufacturer’s instructions. However, they aren’t waterproof, so a good-quality liner is essential to keep the rest of the bathroom dry.</p> <p>A plastic shower curtain is durable, waterproof, and wrinkle-resistant, and it performs well in bathrooms that receive a lot of wear and tear—for example, if you have small children. Keep in mind that plastic can look and feel a bit stiffer and cheaper than natural fabrics.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of shower curtain is best for a small bathroom?</h3> <p>When you lack space in the bathroom, a shower curtain that features pockets for storing essentials, like the Water-Repellent Fabric Shower Curtain from Mrs Awesome, can be an ideal solution.</p> <h3>Q: Are shower curtains machine washable?</h3> <p>Yes, some shower curtains are machine washable. Read the washing instructions on the label carefully before placing them in the washing machine.</p>",280
27,bidet,"<p>New bidet users may have questions about choosing and using the best bidet. To help you get the most out of your bidet purchase and ensure you’re selecting the best bidet product for your home, we’ve answered some common questions about this bathroom addition below.</p> <h3>Q: Can you add a bidet to a regular toilet?</h3> <p>You can add a handheld bidet or bidet toilet seat to most regular toilets. Ensure you choose a bidet product that fits the size and shape of your toilet, as certain models, such as a one-piece French Curve toilet, may not work with all bidets.</p> <h3>Q: What is a self-cleaning bidet?</h3> <p>Self-cleaning bidets may rinse or sanitize themselves or use UV lighting to clean the nozzles.</p> <h3>Q: Do you wipe after using a bidet?</h3> <p>You can wipe after using a bidet. However, many people elect a bidet to lower their use of toilet paper, so they may use clean cloths to dry off, air dry, or elect a bidet that blows warm air for drying.</p> <h3>Q: Are bidets healthier than using toilet paper?</h3> <p>Yes, as bidets spray water and rinse the area, they are healthier than using toilet paper, which can leave fecal matter behind.</p> <h3>Q: Do you need a plumber to install a bidet?</h3> <p>Many bidet products can be installed by following the manufacturer’s instructions. However, if plumbing isn’t your strong suit, this is a job best left to a professional installer.</p> <h3>Q: Is it expensive to install a bidet?</h3> <p>If you have a professional install a bidet, it typically costs somewhere between $200 to $1,000. The price ranges from simple installations to installations that require putting a vented drain in place.</p>",278
28,toilet seat,"<p>There is nothing worse than confidently purchasing a product online and then realizing that you still have a ton of questions about whether the item is right for you.

How do you replace the toilet seat?</h3> <p>You can replace the toilet seat by removing the old bolts from the existing seat with a screwdriver and a socket wrench, then installing the new seat with a set of new bolts. Pay attention to how much you tighten the bolts. If they are too tight, the seat (or even the porcelain of the toilet) can crack. If they are too loose, the seat will move around when in use, causing the hinges to bend and break.</p> <h3>Q. What size are toilet seat bolts?</h3> <p>The average bolt size is 3/8 by 2 1/2 inches, though other sizes are available for industrial toilets, heavy-duty toilet seats, and specialty toilets.</p>",240
29,shower faucet,"<p>For some of the most commonly asked questions and their answers, take a look below before shopping for your new shower faucet set.</p> <h3>Q: How long can I expect my shower faucet to last?</h3> <p>The durability of your shower faucet can depend on a lot of factors such as brand, frequency of use, frequency of cleaning and maintenance, and hardness of water. However, a shower faucet should be able to last between 15 and 20 years before needing replacement.</p> <h3>Q: What is hard water buildup? </h3> <p>Hard water occurs with the presence of an excess of heavy minerals like calcium, iron, and magnesium. These minerals can cause long-term damage to a water system, but signs of hard water are easily recognizable, including a chalky film on dishes, mineral deposits, and scale buildup on water fixtures like faucets and shower heads. Solve hard water issues with a water softener.</p> <h3>Q: Can I install a shower faucet by myself, or do I need a plumber? </h3> <p>This depends heavily on your plumbing experience, the current configuration and quality of your plumbing system, and your desired post-installation shower configuration. Assuming that you have a basic knowledge of plumbing, a relatively new plumbing system, and you want to replace your existing system with a similar style, then you should have everything you need to do the job yourself.</p> <p>However, if you aren’t quite sure what you are doing or you want to make big changes to your shower configuration, it would be a good idea to hire a plumber. Additionally, most shower faucets will indicate whether they are simple to install or if they require a plumber for installation.</p>",273
30,shower filter,"<p>Want to know more? Here are answers to the most commonly asked questions about shower filters.</p> <h3>Q. Are there toxic metals in household water?</h3> <p>There are heavy metals found in household water. They include lead, iron, mercury, arsenic, and nickel. Your new filter will remove them from the water.</p> <h3>Q. How do you install a shower filter?</h3> <p>Installation is tool-free. You twist the old showerhead off at the pipe fitting, wrap the pipe threads with Teflon tape, and screw the new filter on in its place. You can repeat the process for screwing the showerhead onto the filter. Remember to tighten no more than hand-tight.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a shower filter last?</h3> <p>It depends on how many people live in the household. Generally speaking, three to six months is the lifespan of a family shower filter.</p>",137
31,high pressure shower head,"<h3>Q. What is a good water pressure for a shower?</h3> <p>Standard residential water pressure in the United States is between 45 and 55 pounds per square inch (psi). Lower water pressure can be increased by installing a high-pressure shower head.</p> <h3>Q. Are there shower heads that increase water pressure?</h3> <p>Yes. High-pressure shower heads increase water pressure either by decreasing the flow rate or using a compression chamber.</p> <h3>Q. How do high-pressure shower heads work?</h3> <p>High-pressure shower heads restrict the volume of water flowing through the pipe, like when a gardener sticks a thumb partly over the end of a trickling garden hose to make it spray farther. Inside the shower head, there are components to regulate the high pressure water flow and provide an even shower.</p>",126
32,toilet flush valve,"<p>Before investing in a new toilet flush valve, consider the answers to these frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Are all toilet flush valves the same?</h3> <p>No. Toilet flush valves come in a variety of sizes, and there are also several types, including standard, tower- or canister-style, and dual flush valve.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean a toilet flush valve? </h3> <p>If you suspect that your toilet flush valve is not working properly, cleaning it may fix the issue.</p> <ol><li>Turn off your water supply at the toilet’s shut-off valve to prevent further water from entering into the back of the toilet.</li><li>Flush the toilet to clear the remaining water from the tank and use a sponge or cloth to mop up any water still sitting in the bottom.</li><li>Lift the valve seat or flapper, and scrub it with a noncorrosive bathroom cleaning solution; avoid drain cleaner or undiluted bleach.</li><li>Remove the seal and clean the bottom of the toilet tank.</li><li>Clean and inspect the seal before either replacing the seal with a new one or reinstalling the cleaned seal.</li><li>Check that the flush valve is closing correctly by turning on the water at the shut-off valve and allowing the tank to fill.</li><li>If water does not pass through the closed flush valve, cleaning the valve and seal has remedied the issue. If this is not the case, check that everything is correctly installed, and consider replacing the flush valve.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How long does a toilet flush valve last?</h3> <p>Flush valves will commonly wear out before your toilet, lasting on average between six and seven years, depending on the quality of water, frequency of toilet use, and whether you’ve used harsh chemical cleaners.</p> <h3>Q: How do you know if your toilet flush valve is bad?</h3> <p>If your toilet flush valve is faulty, the toilet has gotten noisier, the tank is slower to refill or possibly will not refill at all (causing the toilet to continue running indefinitely), or the tank begins leaking. You can determine whether this is the flush valve or the fill valve by looking at the overflow tube in the toilet. If the water level is overflowing into the tube, then the issue is the fill valve. If the water level stays below the top of the tube, the problem is being caused by the flush valve releasing water through the seal.</p> <h3>Q: How much does it cost to replace a toilet flush valve?</h3> <p>On average it costs about $70 to $150 to have a plumber replace a toilet flush valve. Replacing this part on your own costs between $5 and around $25.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

34,toilet paper,"<p>With all the choices available, finding the best toilet paper can be a bit overwhelming, so you might still have some questions. Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about toilet paper.</p> <h3>Q: How long is a toilet paper roll?</h3> <p>The length of a roll of toilet paper varies greatly depending on the brand. They also vary in width, so square footage is an ideal measure of quantity. In terms of square footage, the top brands range from 21 to 53 square feet of toilet paper per roll. While the number of sheets per roll varies, most rolls contain 1000 sheets for 1 ply, 500 sheets for 2 ply, and around 330 sheets for 3 ply toilet paper.</p> <h3>Q: How long does toilet paper last?</h3> <p>According to one market research study, the average two-person household goes through 4.5 double rolls of toilet paper per week if they are home full time.

35,toilet flapper,"<p>If you still have unanswered questions about how flappers work, read on for answers to some of the most common concerns.</p> <h3>Q. Are all toilet flappers the same?</h3> <p>Toilet flappers are different in size, type, and quality. There are 2-inch and 3-inch flappers, which will fit only the corresponding-sized toilet valve. Manufacturers use different materials to prevent malfunctions and increase the life span of the flapper. There also are different types, including those that have flow adjusters built into the flapper or those that use floats to manage flush volume.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know if my toilet flapper is bad?</h3> <p>A bad toilet flapper no longer creates a tight seal around the flush valve, causing water to leak into the bowl when the toilet is not in use. The telltale sound of a leaky flapper is a dripping sound. You also may hear the hiss sound of your toilet refilling every few minutes or so, depending on the size of the leak. This is the sound of your toilet fill valve keeping the tank filled as the water leaks out.</p> <h3>Q. How do you replace a toilet flapper?</h3> <p>Use the following instructions to replace your toilet’s flapper.</p> <ul><li>Begin by turning off the water by twisting the shutoff valve near the floor behind the toilet.</li><li>Flush the toilet to remove all the water in the tank. The toilet should not begin refilling.</li><li>Remove the flapper by popping off the mounting pegs on the overflow tube.</li><li>Make sure you measure your old flapper so you can find the proper size for a replacement.</li><li>Replace the flapper by snapping the new one onto the tube, then open the shutoff valve.</li></ul> <h3>Q. How do you install a flapper fill valve?</h3> <ul><li>Begin by shutting off the water to the toilet and draining the tank, as described in the above instructions.</li><li>Detach the fill valve by unscrewing the water supply line and locknut from the outside of the tank.</li><li>Install the new valve by placing it in the tank and securing it with the supply line and locknut. Make sure to use the proper gaskets that are included with the new valve to ensure there are no leaks in the connection.</li><li>Open the water supply line. Water should begin filling the tank from the new fill valve.</li></ul> <h3>Q. How long do flappers last?</h3> <p>A toilet flapper will usually last 3 to 5 years on average. It is recommended to avoid chemical bowl cleaners because they can quickly wear out rubber flappers.</p>",409
36,bathroom scale,"<p>Before deciding on the best bathroom scale for your needs, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers.</p> <h3>Q. How do you calibrate a digital bathroom scale?</h3> <p>You can calibrate a digital bathroom scale if it has a calibration function, which is typically a button with the label “Cal” or “Cal/Mode.” To calibrate a scale, follow these simple steps:</p> <ol><li>Gather objects with a known weight, such as a weight from a home gym.</li><li>Activate the “calibration” mode on your digital scale using the calibration button or through the menu option.</li><li>Place the weight on the scale, ensuring that it sits in the middle of the platform without moving or wobbling.</li><li>After the scale reads the weight, press the calibration button again to finish the process.</li><li>To verify that calibration was successful, place the object with the known weight on the scale. If the scale displays the correct weight, then it’s calibrated correctly.</li></ol> <h3>Q. Should you weigh yourself every day?</h3> <p>If actively tracking weight and fitness goals, weigh yourself every day around the same time, so you have an accurate and consistent daily weight record. A daily weigh-in helps you stay on track with weight goals, though you should avoid becoming fixated on daily weight fluctuations. Another option is to create a plan to accurately measure weight-loss milestones with a weekly weigh-in that takes place on approximately the same day and time every week.</p> <h3>Q.

44,toilet,"<p>If you’re wondering how to measure for a new commode or how to complete some basic toilet repairs, read on for answers.</p> <h3>Q: How do you measure a toilet?</h3> <p>The best way to measure for a new toilet is to use its rough-in measurement. Measure from the wall to the center of the toilet’s drain hole. Make sure this matches the toilet rough-in measurement to ensure a proper fit.</p> <p>You may also want to measure the toilet’s length, which is taken from the back of the tank to the front lip of the bowl, to ensure it will not take up too much space in the bathroom.</p> <h3>Q: How do you unclog a toilet?</h3> <p>You can unclog a toilet using a chemical method or manual method. If you own a plunger, stick the plunger into the bowl so that it covers the drain hole, making as tight a seal as possible around the hole. Make sure there is enough water in the bowl to cover the head of the plunger so that it can create enough suction. Begin slowly plunging until the clog is released.</p> <p>If you don’t own a plunger, combine one cup of baking soda and one cup of vinegar and pour it down the toilet drain. The mixture will bubble up, loosening any clog in the toilet.</p> <h3>Q: How do you drain a toilet?</h3> <p>Turn off the water supply valve to the toilet, located near the floor on the wall just below the tank. Flush the toilet multiple times until most of the water in the bowl and tank has drained away. Use a sponge or old towel to remove any remaining water.</p> <h3>Q: How do you remove hard water stains from a toilet?</h3> <p>Begin by adding 1 cup of vinegar to the toilet bowl. Use a brush to mix it in with the water, then let it sit for a few minutes. Add a cup of baking soda and another two cups of vinegar, which will cause the water to bubble and fizz.</p> <p>After 10 minutes, scrub the stains with a brush. Let the mixture sit for another 30 minutes, scrub again to completely remove the stains, then flush. Some toilet bowl cleaners are also effective at removing water stains.</p> <h3>Q: Why is my toilet not shutting off?</h3> <p>If your toilet continues to run after it’s done filling the tank, you likely need to replace the flapper, which is the rubber piece that covers the drain at the bottom of the toilet tank. The flapper is supposed to create a watertight seal over the drain while the toilet sits idle. If the flapper is faulty, it will not make a good seal, causing water to leak into the bowl continuously.</p> <h3>Q: How do I fix my toilet pump?</h3> <p>If your toilet pump, better known as the fill valve, is making screeching noises or takes an excessive amount of time to fill the toilet, it likely means that the fill valve has become clogged with sediment, which is hindering its ability to refill the tank with fresh water after each flush. You’ll need to replace the fill valve with a new one.</p> <h3>Q: How do I fix a toilet that runs intermittently?</h3> <p>A toilet that runs intermittently suffers from a leaky flapper that is allowing water to continuously run into the bowl through the drain at the bottom of the tank.</p> <p>The intermittent hissing is the sound of your fill valve trying to keep the tank full as the water leaks out of it and into the bowl. You’ll need to replace the flapper to fix this issue (and halt the flow of money going down the toilet in the form of wasted water!).</p>",617

How do I install a toilet paper holder?</h3> <p>It depends on the toilet paper holder type. One with a freestanding design can sit on the floor wherever it is convenient; a tank-mounted holder will hang from a hook on the toilet tank; and a wall-mounted holder should be mounted with screws or adhesive according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p> <h3>Q. How do you extend a toilet paper holder?</h3> <p>Check if your holder can fit a toilet paper extender; some toilet paper holders can accommodate an extender rod to fit larger toilet paper rolls.</p> <h3>Q. How do you remove an old toilet paper holder?</h3> <p>Freestanding and tank-mounted holders are easy to remove, but wall-mounted holders may pose more of a challenge.

52,vanity lighting,"<p>Choosing the best vanity lighting for your bathroom might feel overwhelming because there are so many fixture designs and sizes from which to choose. Before you begin shopping for the best vanity lighting, here are answers to a few questions you may have.</p> <h3>Q: What is the right ratio of mirror and vanity light?</h3> <p>It’s recommended that vanity lighting fixtures be three-fourths as wide as the vanity mirror. If you have two sinks, however, two lighting fixtures will offer a more symmetrical look.</p> <h3> Q: What kind of lighting is best for applying makeup?</h3> <p>Cool light, which has a clean glow more similar to natural light, is preferred for applying makeup. Warm light is very flattering but does not accurately represent real color, which could lead to heavier than necessary makeup application.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of lighting is best for a bathroom vanity?</h3> <p>Incandescent, halogen, and LED light sources most accurately render color. And warmer light temperatures tend to be more flattering and inviting than cooler light temperatures.</p> <h3>Q: How many light bulbs should a vanity have?</h3> <p>To ensure proper brightness in your bathroom, a vanity light fixture should have at least 2 60-watt incandescent bulbs.</p> <h3>Q: How bright should bathroom vanity lights be?</h3> <p>To ensure proper visibility during your usual bathroom tasks, a bathroom vanity should be lit with at least 1,600 lumens of light (the equivalent of 2 incandescent or LED bulbs).</p> <h3>Q: Is it better to have vanity lights up or down?</h3> <p>Positioning your vanity lights upwards forces light to stop once it hits your ceiling, providing a more ambient and muted look.

As a rule of thumb, your multi-light fixture should be placed no closer than 1 inch from the top of the mirror.</p> <p>The same rule applies with single-light fixtures and sconces, but these can also be affixed 1-inch from either side of the mirror at eye-level. It should also be noted that these fixtures should be placed 35 to 40 inches apart.</p> <h3>Q: How do you know what size vanity light you need?</h3> <p>The right vanity light for your bathroom depends on the size of your space and is proportionate to the size of your mirror or cabinetry. Be sure to measure these items before purchasing a vanity light. For proper light distribution, large bathrooms will require multi-light fixtures with more bulbs, while smaller bathrooms and power rooms could suffice with two single-light fixtures or sconces.</p> <h3>Q: What is the most flattering lighting for a bathroom?</h3> <p>Ideal lighting in your bathroom will match the finish of your current fixtures and aren’t longer than your bathroom’s mirror or cabinet. Many prefer multi-light fixtures for ample light distribution and their stylish bulb coverings.</p> <h3>Q: Is warm white or cool white lighting better for bathrooms?</h3> <p>The ideal color temperature in your bathroom depends on personal preference. Most prefer to have calming, ambient light in these spaces, which comes from warm lighting. But, for those that prefer to have more natural, bright light in their bathroom, cool light may be ideal.</p>",571

Check out some of the most frequently asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need special paint for the bathroom?</h3> <p>It’s definitely recommended to use special paint for a bathroom. While it’s possible to use ordinary paints in a bathroom, paint manufacturers invest a lot of effort to produce bathroom-friendly formulas. These specially formulated paints are better suited to survive the humid environment and resist peeling and prevent the growth of mold and mildew.</p> <h3>Q: Is there a waterproof paint for bathrooms?</h3> <p>There are numerous water-resistant bathroom paints designed to prevent humidity from attacking the underlying wall structure. While these paints easily shed water, they may not withstand being submerged—in the event of a bathroom flooding, for example—or survive water from a burst pipe being sprayed directly at painted walls over a significant period of time.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need to prime bathroom walls before painting?</h3> <p>Many of the best bathroom paints incorporate a primer, so only one product is necessary. However, separate antibacterial and mold-resistant primers are also available.</p> <h3>Q: How do you prepare a bathroom for painting?</h3> <p>Although some primers can be directly applied, first undertaking a thorough cleaning of the bathroom walls and ceiling is usually more beneficial in the long term. Use a solution of either three parts water to one part bleach, or dilute TSP (trisodium phosphate) as recommended to clean grease or mold off the bathroom walls and ceiling. Rinse with clean water.</p> <p>When dry, scrape off any loose paint and give all surfaces a light rub with 120/150 grit sandpaper to provide a key for the new paint. Remember to wear gloves throughout this process to protect your hands.</p>",319

However, you might have a few questions about the installation and the door itself.</p> <h3>Q: How do you stop a frameless shower door from leaking?</h3> <p>A leak-free frameless shower door starts with building the shower correctly. The floor should decline slightly toward the center to prevent water from pooling in the shower or leaking outside of it.</p> <p>Next, make sure the water doesn’t point and spray directly at the shower door. This helps the door gently angle the water toward the floor and drain. Consider a rainfall showerhead that directs the water toward the floor rather than spraying toward the walls.</p> <p>Finally, plastic stoppers can be fitted onto the bottom of some frameless shower doors if you still have problems with leaks.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between semi-frameless and frameless shower doors?</h3> <p>Semi-frameless shower doors have a side or two or three encased in metal like framed shower doors. Parts of the semi-frameless door are frameless, but not the entire door. In a frameless design, the door itself has no metal frame on it. It may attach to a metal frame in the doorway, but the door is a single piece of glass with no frame.</p> <h3>Q: Are frameless shower doors safe?</h3> <p>They are safe as long as they are installed correctly, which can be said about any shower door. Correct installation assures that the shower walls can support the door and that tracks and anchor points are lined up correctly.</p> <h3>Q: How is a frameless shower door installed?</h3> <p>Installation of a frameless shower door requires more work and know-how than a framed or semi-frameless model. Measurements and angles must be precise before starting the installation to prevent gaps. Include an extra 1/16 inch in your measurements to account for the tape measure’s metal tang. You need to be as precise as possible.</p> <p>The rest of the installation requires shims, drills, and at least two pairs of hands to hold the door, keeping it in place with attaching it to the hardware. Depending on the bathroom design, a masonry drill, other special power tools, or professional help may be needed. However, having it installed by a professional can be pricey.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

Are cordless vacuums suitable for tile floors? </h3> <p>Today’s cordless vacuums generally have good suction that works well on small areas (less than 1,000 square feet) of tile flooring. They’re great for spot cleaning in large homes, but the battery life could limit their use as a whole-house vacuum in homes over 1,000 square feet. However, for a tiny space or a home with a small tile area, a cordless vacuum provides maneuverability and portability to accommodate these areas of the home.</p> <h3>Q.

113,mop for wood floors,"<p>Those who still want more information on cleaning hardwood flooring with a quality mop may find it here, in the answers to some of the most common questions about this household chore.</p> <h3>Q. Is mopping good for wood-floor surfaces?</h3> <p>Mopping correctly can be a great way to maintain hardwood flooring, but using the wrong cleaning products can actually damage these expensive surfaces. A damp mop is often all that’s required to clean a hardwood floor; if the mop is too wet (with water or cleaning solution), excess liquid can seep into the cracks, causing the wood to warp.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to mop a floor?</h3> <p>Cleaning a floor starts with removing dust and debris by sweeping, vacuuming, or dry-mopping. For stubborn dirt and stains, use a cleaner designed for the specific floor material, using a “less is more” approach according to the manufacturer’s directions. To mop a floor correctly, dip string or sponge mops in the cleaning fluid, wring it out, and then swab with the damp mop. Use plain water to do a final rinse if desired. Start mopping in a far corner of the room, moving in the direction of the grain on hardwood floors, and work your way to the door. When finished, rinse the mop and let it air dry or wash any reusable pads.</p> <h3>Q. Will a Swiffer pad ruin hardwood floors?</h3> <p>Swiffer’s heavy-duty pads are considered safe for linoleum, vinyl, laminate, and ceramic tile, as well as sealed wood, marble, and stone. They should not be used on unsealed wood floors. As with all floor cleaners, be cautious using any fluid on unfinished, damaged, or especially delicate materials.</p> <h3>Q. How often should wood floors be mopped?</h3> <p>The National Wood Flooring Association recommends mopping wood floors monthly with a wood-flooring cleaner. However, it is safe to dry mop daily.</p>",307

Are corded vacuums more powerful than cordless models?</h3> <p>Yes, corded vacuums run on an endless supply of electricity when plugged into household outlets. They have more suction and never need charging.</p> <h3>Q. Are bagless vacuums better than those that use bags?</h3> <p>That all depends on your personal preference. Bagless vacuums don’t require buying replacement bags, so you’ll save some money there. But bagged vacuums trap more dust, so it doesn’t get back in the air; dumping a dustbin can be a pretty dusty affair.</p> <h3>Q. Are expensive vacuums worth it?</h3> <p>Premium vacuums tend to last longer because they contain higher-quality parts, and they may also be more powerful. If you think of a vacuum purchase as an investment in keeping your home clean, a more expensive vacuum might be just the ticket.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a cordless vacuum?</h3> <p>Dump the dustbin when it becomes full, and replace (or wash) the vacuum’s filter to keep it clean. The rollers on most vacuum powerheads can be taken out and cleaned to remove threads and string that tend to wind up around the rollers, making them less efficient.</p> <h3>Q. How long do cordless vacuums last?</h3> <p>You can expect to get 3 to 5 years of service from a typical cordless vacuum.</p>",251

What is the difference between a bagged and bagless vacuum system?</h3> <p>A bagged system has a bag that attaches to the intake of the vacuum, which can be removed and thrown away when it becomes full.

We’ve outlined below some of the most frequently asked questions about these convenient devices.</p> <h3>Q: Are you supposed to vacuum or mop first?</h3> <p>With a vacuum mop combo, you don’t always have to choose. Many of these machines offer incredible suction. As you make a pass over the floor, it picks up particles, while the trigger or the simple push of a button releases liquid that will simultaneously mop the floor. If dealing with a lot of surface grime, including larger particles, consider a few passes of the vacuum mode first before using the mopping feature.</p> <h3>Q: Which is the best vacuum mop combo for hard floors?</h3> <p>We recommend the Shark VM252 VACMOP Pro. It features powerful suction, a spray-mopping system, and a pad-release button for no-touch disposal of dirty cleaning pads.</p> <h3>Q: Is there a robot vacuum that also mops?</h3> <p>For an automated, hands-free cleaning experience that combines supreme suctioning and mopping, try the ECOVACS Deebot T8. It’s an advanced AI robot that uses smart technology to ensure a deep and targeted clean.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain my vacuum mop combo?</h3> <p>Cleaning a vacuum mop combo regularly is one of the most important aspects of maintaining the machine. However, some machines offer a self-cleaning mode. Simply press the button, and the dirt, grime, and water (both within the machine and stuck on the brush) are filtered into the separate dirty tank. This helps prevent future blockages as well.</p> <h3>Q: How long will my vacuum mop combo last? </h3> <p>No matter the machine you choose from this list, if you take proper care of a vacuum mop combo, it is capable of cleaning the home for years. Use with care, cleaning only the recommended surfaces without being too physically rough on the device as you maneuver it. After each use, clean out the machine, utilizing the self-cleaning mode if available.</p>",342

Which is the most powerful cordless vacuum cleaner?</h3> <p>Power comes from quality design, craftsmanship, and engineering.

Regular vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum can remove common indoor allergens like pet hair, dander, mold spores, and dust mite particles to alleviate allergy symptoms.</p> <h3>Q. How do I take care of a vacuum for allergies?</h3> <p>Maintaining a vacuum for allergies is like maintaining any vacuum cleaner: It should be emptied and cleaned regularly, and its filters should be replaced when needed.

Boiling water should never be used.</p> <h3>Q: Should you vacuum after carpet cleaning? </h3> <p>Vacuuming should be done before and after cleaning a carpet to ensure that dust, debris, and larger materials do not end up in your carpet cleaner’s water tank.</p> <h3>Q: How often should carpet be cleaned?</h3> <p>Carpets in homes with pets benefit from a carpet cleaner washing approximately three to four times a year. Vacuuming at least twice a week will help pick up loose pet hair and dander between cleanings.</p> <h3>Q: Can I walk on my carpet after using a carpet cleaner? </h3> <p>While some carpet cleaning machines have a heated drying function built-in, some models may leave your carpet wet for over 6 hours after use.</p> <h3>Q: How should a carpet cleaner be stored to prevent it from growing mold or bacteria?</h3> <p>To prevent mold and bacteria growth, make sure the carpet cleaner is fully dry before storing it away.

131,vinyl plank flooring,"<p>The above information should have provided plenty of insight into how to choose the best vinyl plank flooring for a number of different locations. Our top picks provide real-world examples. If you still have questions about how to choose the right vinyl plank flooring, read on.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best thickness for vinyl plank flooring?</h3> <p>It depends on which is most suitable for the installation. With WPC flooring, a thinner plank may be perfectly acceptable in areas of low traffic, whereas a thicker flexible luxury vinyl plank is probably desirable in lounge or other high-traffic areas. However, SPC can be very tough, despite being comparatively thin. It’s important to consider what happens at the transition between rooms. Choosing a vinyl plank that is too thick can lead to problems with leveling at the doorway.</p> <h3>Q. Is there such a thing as scratch-proof vinyl flooring?</h3> <p>Vinyl plank flooring is best described as scratch resistant rather than scratch-proof, though it does depend on the quality of the product chosen. Some can be very tough indeed, and many are more resistant to damage than expensive hardwood flooring. Scratching isn’t a common problem, but it can happen. When moving furniture or appliances it’s a good idea to lift rather than drag them, for example.</p> <h3>Q. Can I install vinyl plank flooring on my own?</h3> <p>Absolutely. One of the major advantages of vinyl plank flooring is its ease of installation. Few tools are required and, with a little care, even those with only modest DIY skills can achieve a professional finish.</p> <h3>Q. Is vinyl plank flooring waterproof?</h3> <p>It depends on the type, so it’s important to check the specifications carefully. Some options are described as water resistant, which is fine in areas where occasional spills are soon cleaned up. For areas that are regularly exposed to moisture, such as bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms, look for 100 percent waterproof vinyl plank flooring.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best way to install vinyl plank flooring?</h3> <p>This will depend on the product you’ve chosen. Typically, vinyl plank flooring is installed by gluing the planks to the subfloor or by using a locking system, which allows the planks to “float” above the subfloor. Some manufacturers also offer loose-lay options.</p> <h3>Q. Can I steam clean my vinyl plank flooring?</h3> <p>While some people suggest using a steam mop on a low setting for cleaning vinyl plank floors—particularly some SPC products—it is not recommended. In fact, some manufacturer warranties specifically say you should not steam-mop your vinyl plank flooring. Steam can eventually penetrate between the planks and get beneath the surface, possibly weakening the glue and causing swelling or warping. Generally, you should use a vacuum or a flat mop that is moist, rather than soaked with water, but always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for cleaning.</p>",463
132,engineered wood flooring,"<p>After choosing engineered wood flooring, you may still have questions. Here are answers to commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Is engineered hardwood the same as laminate?</h3> <p>No, and this is a common misconception. Engineered wood flooring and laminate are similar in that they feature tongue-and-groove designs. They’re different in that laminate is usually made of dense fiberboard with a photo of wood grain beneath a clear plastic protective layer. Laminate doesn’t look as authentic as engineered or real wood, but it’s more affordable and more water- and scratch-resistant than engineered wood flooring.</p> <h3>Q: Can I refinish engineered hardwood?</h3> <p>Yes, you can refinish engineered wood flooring if the veneer layer is 2 millimeters thick or more and doesn’t have an aluminum oxide coating.</p> <h3>Q: Where should I use engineered wood flooring?</h3> <p>Engineered wood can be used in most any application where you would use solid wood flooring. The chief advantage of engineered wood is it can be used in places where solid wood flooring cannot, such as below-grade conditions, bathrooms, basements, and kitchens.</p> <h3>Q: Does engineered wood flooring scratch easily?</h3> <p>Engineered wood flooring scratches just like a solid hardwood floor. But engineered wood flooring coated with aluminum oxide is more scratch resistant than solid hardwood.</p> <h3>Q: Is engineered wood eco-friendly?</h3> <p>Yes. It’s much more eco-friendly than traditional hardwood flooring because each plank uses less wood. This means fewer trees were cut to make the floor so that the harvested lumber can go farther.</p>",241
133,peel and stick floor tile,"<p>The installation of peel-and-stick floor tile is one of the quickest ways to update the look of an entire room, and it’s a DIY-friendly project. However, new users may have some questions about the quality of the tiles and how best to install them.</p> <h3>Q: Should you use extra adhesive with peel-and-stick tile? </h3> <p>The adhesive on the back of the tile is usually sufficient to hold the tile in place. However, to ensure better adhesion, some manufacturers recommend using an additional adhesive when installing the tiles on a plywood subfloor.</p> <h3>Q: How long do peel-and-stick floor tiles last?</h3> <p>Depending on the tile quality and daily wear, expect the floor to last from 2 to 10 years before they must be replaced.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use peel-and-stick tiles on my walls?</h3> <p>Peel-and-stick floor tiles can make a decorative impact on walls, either as a single horizontal layer that serves as a backsplash or over a whole wall to create an accent wall.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need a primer for my peel-and-stick floor tiles? </h3> <p>That depends on the brand—before installation, read the manufacturer’s installation guide first to determine if a primer is warranted. In some cases, a primer can help ensure a tight bond between the existing floor and the new tiles.</p> <h3>Q: Can I remove a tile and reattach it after it’s been installed?</h3> <p>If a tile is slightly crooked, you may be able to lift it right after placement and then reposition it. However, over time, the adhesive can harden, and trying to remove a vinyl tile often results in a torn tile. If you must remove a tile that’s been in place for more than a few days, try warming the surface first with a heat gun to soften the adhesive beneath.</p>",293
134,water based polyurethane for floors,"<p>All this new information about choosing the best water-based polyurethane may have uncovered some new questions. In the following section, we list a collection of some of the most common questions along with their answers about water-based polyurethane.</p> <h3>Q: How many coats of water-based polyurethane should I use?</h3> <p>Experts recommend three coats of water-based polyurethane at minimum, but applying four coats is typically best.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need to sand between coats of water-based polyurethane?</h3> <p>Many of the best polyurethanes require sanding between coats. Use 220-grit sandpaper, and clean the floor thoroughly between coats.</p> <h3>Q: How long does it take for water-based polyurethane to dry on hardwood floors?</h3> <p>Most water-based polyurethanes take between 2 and 4 hours to dry between coats. Full cure depends on the product, but it can take from 24 hours to 7 days.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a roller to apply polyurethane?</h3> <p>Yes, but the roller cover must be smooth to apply the polyurethane uniformly. Any hard-to-reach areas still require brushing.</p> <h3>Q: Is water-based or oil-based polyurethane better for floors?</h3> <p>Both types of polyurethane work well for flooring, with a few differences. Water-based polyurethanes dry quickly and exude fewer fumes. However, oil-based polyurethanes last longer and require less maintenance.</p> <br/> <br/>",205
135,robot vacuums for hardwood floors,"<p>With so many options on the market, choosing a robot vacuum can feel overwhelming. But once you’ve found the right pick, you and your floors can be in effortless dirt-free bliss. Read on for some frequently asked questions and answers about using a robot vacuum on hardwood floors.</p> <h3>Q: Do robot vacuums work well on hardwood floors?</h3> <p>Yes, robot vacuums are an excellent option for hard flooring like hardwood floors.</p> <h3>Q: Do vacuums scratch hardwood floors?</h3> <p>No, a good robot vacuum should not scratch hardwood floors—at least on its own. If sharp debris gets caught under the vacuum’s wheels or sweeper, it can scratch sensitive flooring. To prevent this from happening, make sure to clear any sharp debris before using a robot vacuum.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best way to clean hardwood floors?</h3> <p>For gleaming floors, first gently sweep or vacuum the floor (using a traditional vacuum or robot vacuum) to clear debris from hardwood floors. Next, mop gently using a wood-safe cleaner.</p> <h3>Q: How do you set up a robot vacuum to clean your house?</h3> <p>It depends on the vacuum; some can be turned on and left to run free, while others will need a connection to a smartphone app to set up customizable features. Follow the manufacturer’s directions to set up your new robot vacuum.</p>",217
136,garage floor tiles,"<p>If you’re wondering how to install floor tiles or how tiles compare to other garage flooring options, then read on for the answers.</p> <h3>Q. Are garage floor tiles better than epoxy?</h3> <p>Both have their pros and cons. While garage floor coatings such as epoxy create a seamless hard shell that can last for decades, epoxy can be very tricky to install. Interlocking floor tiles are much easier to install and, like epoxy, offer a wide range of colors and textures; however, they don’t last as long as epoxy nor do they offer a seamless finished look.</p> <h3>Q. How do I lay garage floor tiles?</h3> <p>To lay garage floor tiles, start in one of the front corners of the garage and work out from there, making sure the loops of the tile face toward the inner part of the garage.

Trim the tiles to fit against obstacles or the opposing wall.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean garage floor tiles?</h3> <p>Mix hot water with a household floor cleaner. Sweep the floor then mop it, changing out the soapy fluid frequently for best results. Do not apply too much water or it may leak below the tile to the cement floor below.</p> <h3>Q. Can I put ceramic tile on a garage floor?</h3> <p>While ceramic tile may be suitable for a kitchen or a bathroom, don’t put ceramic tile in a garage. It simply isn’t strong enough to endure the weight of a vehicle or the impact caused by heavy tools falling on it.</p>",291

Do I need underlayment for vinyl plank flooring?</h3> <p>Before choosing an underlayment for vinyl plank flooring, it’s important to check with the manufacturer to establish whether an underlayment is necessary. Some companies will clearly specify the type of underlayment that needs to be used. Some will even void the flooring’s warranty if the wrong type of underlayment is used.</p> <h3>Q. Should I put a vapor barrier under vinyl plank flooring?</h3> <p>A vapor barrier underlayment or moisture barrier underlayment can be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with a standard underlayment in areas that experience moisture to prevent the development of mold.</p> <h3>Q.

How often should I scrub my floors?</h3> <p>Most home flooring could use a deep clean once every couple of weeks. Consider cleaning bathroom and kitchen floors more often due to the higher presence of germs and bacteria.</p> <h3>Q.

They sweep up dust and dirt as they scrub floors, getting rid of the need to sweep or vacuum beforehand.</p> <p>Most electric home floor scrubbers have disc scrubbers, which have flat pads that rotate or vibrate to clean flooring. Since they lay flat on the floor, they can’t sweep up hard, dry debris. Floors should be vacuumed or swept before using a disc scrubber.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my floor scrubber last?</h3> <p>Floor scrubbers can last many years. Their scrubbing pads will need frequent cleaning and replacing, depending on how often they are used. Clean bristles and mop pads after each use, and consider replacing the scrubber head altogether if it starts to pick up permanent stains or a lingering smell.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

One of the newest designs, the i9 Roomba, comes in a D-shape with a flat edge that smartly tracks into corners to get even more dirt.</p> <h3>Q: Are Roombas loud?</h3> <p>Still a vacuum, a Roomba can be considered loud. They can be great to operate while you’re away from home. In some situations, you may be able to run the machine without disturbing sleep if you’re not near the device (like on another floor).</p> <h3>Q: How do you properly recycle an old Roomba?</h3> <p>At the end of its life, a Roomba battery or the entire machine can be safely recycled through local electronics/battery recycling programs or through Roomba’s recycling partners in the U.S. and around the world.</p>",540

PVA is the most popular type of wood glue, as it’s strong and easy to clean up. DIYers can sand it or paint it, depending on their preference.</p> <h3>Q: Is wood glue stronger than screws?</h3> <p>Wood glue can be stronger than screws, but it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Screws only hold wood together in one specific location. Wood glue, when used properly, covers a large surface area.</p> <h3>Q: How long should you clamp glued wood?</h3> <p>Every glue is different, and even the strongest wood glue requires a set amount of time for clamping. Some glues require 30 minutes of clamp time, while others might require several hours. The Titebond Polyurethane requires 1 to 4 hours of clamping time while also curing 100 percent in the same amount of time.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use too much wood glue?</h3> <p>Glue-up can be an icky, messy process, as a good joint requires a bit of excess glue (known as “squeeze-out”). Too much glue can cause excessive squeeze-out, which might not cause issues with the joint but rather make the workpiece more difficult to finish. Too much glue also can accidentally cause the workpiece to adhere to the table.</p>",271
147,rechargeable batteries,"<p>If you’re wondering how many times you can recharge a rechargeable battery or what the longest-lasting rechargeable is, then read on for answers to these and other questions about rechargeable batteries.</p> <h3>Q: Do rechargeable batteries last as long as nonrechargeable batteries?</h3> <p>Rechargeable batteries have a shorter shelf life than standard nonrechargeable batteries. A rechargeable battery will typically last between 3 and 5 years, while a lithium nonrechargeable battery has a typical shelf life of 10 to 12 years. An alkaline nonrechargeable battery will last 5 to 10 years. Of course, once a nonrechargeable battery is used, it cannot be recharged.</p> <h3>Q: How many times can you charge rechargeable batteries?</h3> <p>That depends on the battery’s lifespan. Most rechargeable batteries can be charged around 500 times before they will no longer hold a charge. Some long lifespan rechargeable batteries can be recharged more than 2,000 times.</p> <h3>Q: What are some disadvantages of rechargeable batteries?</h3> <p>There are some disadvantages with rechargeable batteries. Some rechargeable batteries produce less voltage than disposable batteries, which can affect performance. Rechargeable batteries also have a higher up-front cost than disposable batteries. Rechargeable battery performance also becomes unpredictable as they age and hold less and less charge.</p> <h3>Q: Does it matter which charger I use for rechargeable batteries?</h3> <p>You can use any brand to charge a rechargeable battery; however, the type of charger must match the battery. For example, a NiMH battery will only work with an NiMH charger. To maximize the lifespan of the battery and ensure you’re getting a full charge, it’s also a good idea to use a smart charger.</p> <h3>Q: How long can you leave rechargeable batteries on the charger?</h3> <p>Most battery chargers automatically set themselves to trickle once the batteries reach a full charge; however, it’s a good idea to avoid leaving the batteries in the charger for more than 24 hours to prevent damage to them that can shorten their lifespan.</p> <h3>Q: Which rechargeable batteries last the longest?</h3> <p>With a 2,700-mAh capacity, Powerex PRO rechargeable AA batteries are among the longest-lasting options we could find.</p>",342

Stainless steel is better for corrosion resistance, but carbon steel holds the edge of the blade for a longer period without needing to be sharpened. However, laminated steel is corrosion-resistant, and it’s the sharpest pocket knife steel due to the layering process.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best pocket knife sharpener?</h3> <p>There are many different pocket knife sharpeners to choose from, so what might be right for one knife may not be the best choice for a different knife. Some of the top pocket knife sharpeners include the Work Sharp Guided Field Sharpener, Smith’s CCKS 2-Step Knife Sharpener, and the Work Sharp Knife &amp; Tool Sharpener, Ken Onion Edition.</p> <h3>Q: How do I sharpen a pocket knife?</h3> <p>There are many different ways to sharpen a pocket knife, but the most common method employs a sharpening stone. Lay the blade of the knife flat on the stone, then angle it just slightly while pushing the knife away from the body, like trying to cut off a piece of the sharpening stone. Or lay the blade flat on the stone with a slight angle, then sharpen the knife by applying pressure to the blade and moving the knife in a small circular motion against the stone.</p> <p>As an alternative to a sharpening stone, consider purchasing a pocket knife sharpener, which is easier to use but may not achieve the same quality of result.</p> <h3>Q: How do I clean a pocket knife?</h3> <p>Following these simple steps to clean a pocket knife:</p> <ol><li>Gather gloves, soft cloths, a scrubbing sponge or toothbrush, dish soap, and a lubricant for the blade.</li><li>Don the gloves and wet a soft cloth with warm water. Use the cloth to wipe down both sides of the knife.</li><li>Use the dish soap and the sponge (or toothbrush for a serrated blade) to scrub the metal blade.</li><li>Rinse the blade with warm water, and dry with a clean cloth.</li><li>Add a few drops of lubricant to the blade to protect it from rusting and moisture damage.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How do I get the rust off a pocket knife?</h3> <p>Remove rust from a pocket knife with an abrasive steel pad, a household rust-removal solution such as white vinegar, or a commercial rust remover that uses a chemical solvent to clean rust from the blade.</p> <h3>Q: How do I close a pocket knife?</h3> <p>To close a pocket knife, hold the knife by the sides of the hilt, ensuring that no fingers are over the storage slot for the knife blade, then grip the blade firmly with the other hand and push the knife into the slot slowly. If the knife has a blade lock, unlock the blade before closing the knife.</p>",572
150,tin snips,"<p>If you still aren’t certain about which tin snips you need, take a look below to find the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions so that you can make a better-informed decision.</p> <h3>Q. What is the purpose of tin snips?</h3> <p>Tin snips are designed for the purpose of cutting or trimming thin metal materials, like those used for gutters or metal roofing.</p> <h3>Q. What are tin snips made of?</h3> <p>Tin snips typically have padded, rubber handles with drop forged steel blades that can easily cut through thin sheet metal.</p> <h3>Q. What can you cut with tin snips?</h3> <p>Tin snips can be used to cut a variety of soft, thin gauge metals including carbon steel, stainless steel, copper, aluminum, and tin.</p> <h3>Q. Why are tin snips colored?</h3> <p>The handles of some tin snips can have a color-coding system that indicates whether they should be used for clockwise cuts, counterclockwise cuts, or straight cuts. Green handles indicate a clockwise cut and red handles indicate a counterclockwise cut, while yellow-handled snips are for straight cuts.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use tin snips?</h3> <p>You use tin snips in a similar way to using scissors, though the resistance through metal is much greater than scissor blades cutting through paper. Ensure that you nestle the metal deep into the jaws of the tin snips, opening the cutters as wide as possible at the start of each cut. This should help apply the correct amount of strength to produce clean cuts.</p> <p>If you want to make a circular cut, you need to punch a starter hole through the metal with a straight blade screwdriver or another piercing tool so the blades of the tin snips have a place to start cutting.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen tin snips?</h3> <p>Before trying to sharpen your tin snips, ensure that the blades are not serrated, as serrated edges cannot be sharpened. If the blades are not serrated, follow the steps below to sharpen the tin snips.</p> <ol><li>Clean the tin snips to remove any oils, dirt, or residue that may be on the blades.</li><li>Open the blades as wide as possible, then take them apart by removing the central bolt.</li><li>Examine the blades for any nicks, marks, or defects, then secure the blades in a table vice.</li><li>Using a metal filer, begin filing each blade on an angle from the pivot point to the tip of the blade. Make sure you only file in one direction to properly hone the edge.</li><li>Continue filing until you feel the blade is sharp enough.</li><li>Add polish to the tin snip blades with a whetstone that has been soaked in water.</li></ol> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

What does a hand truck look like?</h3> <p>The classic hand truck has a strong metal frame, a pair of handles at the top, a load platform at the bottom, and usually has a pair of rubber wheels. However, modern designs vary considerably from compact folding models to those that convert to flatbed carts.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a hand truck?</h3> <p>There are a lot of things you may think about when choosing a hand truck. The “What to Consider When Choosing the Best Hand Trucks” section above explains the benefits of each type; it will help you narrow down the options until you find the best hand truck for the loads you need to move.</p> <h3>Q.

Otherwise, make sure the bulb is rated for use in wet conditions.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of light bulb should I use for a porch light?</h3> <p>The best bulb to use for a porch light is an LED bulb that produces about 800 lumens. The LED bulb will use the least amount of energy and last much longer than any other bulb type. A brightness of 800 lumens will provide adequate visibility without being overly bright.</p> <h3>Q: What type of lighting is best for outdoors?</h3> <p>The best type of lighting, outdoors and in, is LED. LED lights use far less energy than incandescent or even halogen bulbs, so you can leave them on for long periods without heavily impacting the electric bill. They also last a long time, so you won’t need to replace them very often.</p> <h3>Q: Is soft white or bright white better for outside?</h3> <p>Soft white lights are the best option for mood lighting outdoors, as they simulate the vibe of a cozy open fire. Bright white light is best suited for security or task lighting.</p> <h3>Q: How bright should porch lights be?</h3> <p>A porch light should be around 600 lumens; however, feel free to go high as 800 lumens for more visibility or as low as 400 lumens for a more nuanced vibe.</p>",279

160,rust remover,"<p>The article above provides a wealth of valuable information about rust removers and converters. Many of the questions that arise have been answered, but for convenience we have covered the most common ones here.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a rust remover and a rust converter?</h3> <p>A rust remover lifts away surface rust and can often be brushed or rinsed off. A rust converter changes the chemical composition of the rust into a stable form that can often be sanded and repainted.</p> <h3>Q: Should I use rust remover or converter?</h3> <p>It depends on the material being treated and what you want to do with it.</p> <p>For fabrics, tile, and stone and for cleaning metal tools or components, a rust remover should be used. For auto body, machinery, or tool repair, you may want to use a rust converter, although bear in mind the resulting material will not have the strength of the original steel.</p> <h3>Q: How does rust spread?</h3> <p>Moisture and air attack unprotected or damaged metal, and then creep along as the surface deteriorates. If it’s caught early enough, repair and refinishing can usually rectify the problem.</p> <h3>Q: Can WD-40 remove rust?</h3> <p>Standard WD-40 can certainly loosen rust on metal, though results on other surfaces are difficult to predict. We would generally recommend a dedicated rust remover specific to the material being treated.</p> <h3>Q: What is the strongest rust remover?</h3> <p>Choosing the single strongest rust remover is difficult because results depend on the material being treated. Naval jelly is very strong but has to be used with great care. We prefer Evapo-Rust or WD-40 Specialist, which are safer but still hard to beat on tools, hardware, and auto parts.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best rust remover for concrete?</h3> <p>While liquids like CLR PRO can work, the concrete needs to be at least a year old and not colored. Iron OUT has no such restrictions, though it may take more than one application on heavy deposits.</p>",327

Can I use shoe cleaner on boots?</h3> <p>You can use shoe cleaner on boots as long as the cleaner will be safe and effective for the material the boots are made of.</p> <h3>Q. Is a patch test on shoe cleaner advisable?</h3> <p>Yes. Prior to using any shoe cleaner, you should do a patch test on an unseen area of one shoe to ensure it doesn’t cause any damage or discoloration to the material.</p>",143
162,concrete cleaner,"<p>If you still want more information about concrete cleaners, read on for answers to several common questions about these products.</p> <h3>Q: Are concrete cleaners harmful to pets?</h3> <p>Always keep children and pets away from the area while using concrete cleaner, and store the products out of their reach. Once cleaned, the area is immediately safe for normal use.</p> <h3>Q: What can I use to clean a concrete driveway? </h3> <p>Remove oil stains and other hydrocarbons with a bioremediation cleaner. For tough algae or moss growth, spot clean with a contractor-grade hypochlorite-based cleaner. Use an acid cleaner to deep clean and remove efflorescence. For general cleaning of a dirty driveway, a pressure washing cleaner will do the trick.</p> <h3>Q: What do you spray on concrete before pressure washing? </h3> <p>The process of pressure washing is made easier and more efficient if the surface is pretreated with a concrete cleaner. Apply the cleaner at low pressure and allow it to stand for three to five minutes before pressure washing.</p> <h3>Q: Will rust come off concrete? </h3> <p>Rust stains on concrete require a specialized acidic cleaner to remove.</p>",182
163,pet stain remover,"<p>If you still have questions about choosing the best pet stain remover, here’s more information to help you make a decision.</p> <h3>Q. How does a pet stain remover work?</h3> <p>Enzymatic pet stain removers use enzymes and good bacteria to break down and digest the organic material in the stain. Solvent-based cleaners use chemicals to break down stains.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a pet stain remover?</h3> <p>With most stain removers, spray the stained area, let the product set for a few minutes, and blot it dry.</p> <h3>Q. How do you remove old pet stains?</h3> <p>Many pet stain removers can remove old, set-in stains as well as fresh ones. Another solution: Mix 1 quart water with ½ cup white vinegar, apply the solution to the stain, let it soak for at least 15 minutes, and then blot up the excess liquid. When it dries completely, sprinkle baking soda over the stained area, and vacuum it up.</p> <h3>Q. Why do carpet stains come back?</h3> <p>Carpet stains may reappear due to wicking or residue. Wicking occurs when too much water or liquid was used when removing the stain. The liquid seeps into the carpet padding, and when the moisture evaporates, the dirt that was mixed with the liquid rises back onto the carpet fibers.</p> <p>Stain residue is another reason carpet stains return. Many carpet cleaners or shampoos leave behind molecules that attract dirt and other debris. These remnants can make your carpet look dirty soon after it was cleaned.</p> <h3>Q. Does vinegar remove pet stains from carpets?</h3> <p>Yes, vinegar can be an effective pet stain remover. When mixed with equal parts water, vinegar can not only get rid of stains but also can eliminate odor. However, an enzymatic cleaner may be more effective at removing odors.</p>",293

What is the best way to clean sterling silver?</h3> <p>The best way to clean sterling silver is with high-quality silver polish. Weiman Silver Polish and Cleaner is suitable for both jewelry and flatware, while a dip, such as Hagerty’s Silver Dip, is best for large sets of silver tableware. For jewelry with gemstones or silver objects with a patina, use a gentle cleaner, such as Scotchguard Tarni-Shield.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep silver shiny?</h3> <p>Regularly buffing silver is the best way to keep it shiny. Use a treated cloth, such as a Mayflower Polishing Cloth, to maintain your silver. Wipe the object with the treated side, rinse it, and buff it with the cloth’s untreated side.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use cleaning wipes for silver-plated items?</h3> <p>Wipes can be used for silver-plated items, as long as the wipes are safe for this purpose.

But if a cleaning product that contains essential oils claims to kill bacteria, as long as it is registered with the EPA then you know the disinfecting, bacteria-killing properties have been proven true.</p> <h3>Q. Are essential oils toxic to humans and pets?</h3> <p>Essential oils must be used as directed. Many are too strong to use without a carrier oil and could burn the skin.

Domestic sewing machines are made with versatility in mind, as hobby sewers typically use their machines for a variety of sewing projects. Industrial (or professional) sewing machines are made with a specific type of sewing in mind based on factors such as fabric type, stitch type, or durability. They also tend to be designed to hold up for longer hours of use each day.</p> <h3>Q.

Once you’ve determined the needle’s sides, the process is very similar to a domestic needle change and will be explained in the machine’s user manual or guide.</p>",353

Vehicle owners waxing their vehicles for the first time should consider starting out with a paste wax.</p> <h3>Q: How often should a car be waxed?</h3> <p>Most car waxes can last up to about 6 months, which means a car should be waxed twice a year.

Read on for some of the most-asked questions about these nails.</p> <h3>Q: Can you hang pictures on drywall with nails?</h3> <p>Nails are a perfectly good option for hanging pictures on your walls. But, one should consider using a hanging hook on a finishing nail to ensure that your picture hangs securely and does not slip off the nail.</p> <h3>Q: How do you anchor a picture on a wall?</h3> <p>Installing drywall anchors to hang pictures provides much greater holding power than nails for heavier frames, but it can be tricky for first-timers. Here is a step-by-step list for anchoring a picture on a wall:</p> <ol><li>Mark the wall where you want to install the anchor. For a heavy frame, consider using a stud finder first to mark the location.</li><li>Pre-drill a hole for the anchor to fit into on the marker. You will need a bit that is slightly smaller than the anchor itself to ensure the anchor will fit snugly.</li><li>Insert the plastic sleeve of the anchor (if required) into the drilled hole. A rubber mallet or a hammer may be required to gently tap the sleeve into place.</li><li>Place or screw the anchor into the sleeve, ensuring that the anchor sticks out from the wall enough to support the frame’s hooks or wire.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How do you hang a picture frame that has no hooks?</h3> <p>If your frame has no hooks or has lost its wiring, new wiring or hooks can be installed on the frame itself. Here are a couple of ways you can add new hanging hardware:</p> <ol><li>Nail in 2 ½-inch finishing nails on the back of the frame and wrap one end of a wire to both nails. Then drive a single ½-inch finishing nail into the wall on a steep angle and hang the frame on the wall with the wire.</li><li>If your frame is made out of metal, you can buy new hooks for the frame. Many can be pressed into the back of the frame or can be placed in the space between the frame and the backing of the picture. Once hanged, use a level to ensure that the hardware is placed correctly.</li></ol>",392

279,table lamps,"<p>With so many lamps to choose from, making a selection isn’t always easy. Beyond style and price, consider a lamp’s technical aspects, such as the amount of light needed for particular tasks and spaces. Read the following answers to some of the most common questions shoppers frequently have when choosing table lamps.</p> <h3>Q: Which table lamp gives the most light?</h3> <p>A lamp that gives the most light has a higher foot candle rating and offers higher lumens. For a lamp to give the most light, choose one with a light-color shade and a slender or clear glass base. Just make sure that the watts and the lumens are equivalent and that the bulb fits the lamp.</p> <h3>Q: How tall should a bedside table lamp be?</h3> <p>Most bedroom lamps are between 24 and 27 inches tall, a measurement based on the height of the average person sitting in bed.

Common items that may require repair on a lamp, the lamp socket and the cord, can be replaced.

Fixing common issues and using long-lasting LED bulbs may allow a lamp to last several decades.

While a lamp doesn’t have to match the decor, it usually has something that helps it blend into a space, such as material, shape, or color.

How do I change the bulbs for chandeliers in very tall spaces?</h3> <p>There are long sticks with suction cups on the end that you can use to unscrew the old bulb and replace the new one in a pendant type of chandelier. However, for tall chandeliers with multiple bulbs, a platform ladder can help provide access to the light bulbs and stability while changing them.</p> <h3>Q.

What are the best light bulbs for a chandelier?</h3> <p>Choosing the best light bulb will be determined by the type of chandelier you choose.

If you still have questions about using the sealer, reach out to the manufacturer and speak with a customer service representative.</p> <h3>Q: How often should you seal granite countertops?</h3> <p>Experts disagree as to how often granite should be sealed.

The following answers to some popular questions may help during your search.</p> <h3>Q: What is a standard-size freezer?</h3> <p>There is not necessarily one standard size for chest freezers. Rather, there are four different size ranges. Within each size range, the freezer’s dimensions may also vary. Below are some general dimensions for each chest freezer size:</p> <ul><li>Compact (3 to 5 cubic feet): 21 to 28 inches wide, 32 to 34 inches high, and 19 to 22 inches deep</li><li>Small (5 to 9 cubic feet): 29 to 38 inches wide, 32 to 34 inches high, and 22 to 27 inches deep</li><li>Medium (10 to 16 cubic feet): 54 to 65 inches wide, 33 to 36 inches high, and 24 to 28 inches deep</li><li>Large (17 or more cubic feet): 72 to 84 inches wide, 31 to 34 inches high, and 27 to 32 inches deep</li></ul> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a chest freezer and a deep freezer?</h3> <p>Deep freezers are specially designed for long-term storage. Their design features additional insulation to ensure food stays completely frozen. Deep freezers can be designed as a chest freezer or an upright freezer and typically have a capacity of between 10 and 25 cubic feet.</p> <h3>Q: Are chest freezers better than upright?</h3> <p>There are pros and cons to both chest freezers and upright freezers. The “best” option can vary from person to person based on their individual storage needs.</p> <p>Chest freezers typically offer a greater storage capacity and are better able to keep foods frozen should the power go out. They also are more economically priced and more energy efficient than upright models. Many chest freezers will last for 15 to 20 years, which is longer than the average upright freezer. On the other hand, chest freezers don’t offer as many shelves and organization baskets (if any) as an upright freezer. They can also be more challenging to clean and often require manual defrost, as opposed to the auto defrost offered with some upright models.</p> <p>Upright freezers make it easier to keep foods organized since they feature more shelves and bulk storage baskets than chest freezers. An upright freezer also has a smaller footprint than a chest freezer and is easier to reach inside and clean. However, upright freezers are more expensive and typically only last between 10 and 15 years. They also don’t stay as cold in a power outage, so it is more likely that the food stored will go bad. While upright freezers can be good for organizing food, the layout of the shelves can make it more challenging to fit large or bulky items.</p> <h3>Q: What is the most efficient chest freezer?</h3> <p>The Northair Chest Freezer is one of the most efficient options on the market. This freezer uses just 0.45 kilowatt hours per day and can help users save on utility bills.</p> <h3>Q: What brand of chest freezer is best?</h3> <p>There are a few top chest freezer manufacturers.

299,kitchen trash can,"<p>Kitchen trash cans aren’t something you think about until they’re overflowing or breaking. If you’re not sure where to start your search, we’ve got answers to common questions.</p> <h3>Q. How big should a kitchen trash can be?</h3> <p>Trash can size depends on the size of the kitchen, the size of your family, and where the trash can will be used.

Larger families, busy kitchens, or small businesses might want to go higher capacity with a 20- to 23-gallon model.</p> <h3>Q.

Under the sink, in the pantry, in the utility room, or next to the island are common places based on different kitchen layouts. Ideally, the trash can is somewhere that’s easily accessible but out of the way or hidden from general foot traffic.</p> <h3>Q.

These mechanisms help hold the can in place while in use.</p> <h3>Q. How do you hide trash cans in the kitchen?</h3> <p>Using an undercabinet model is the most popular way to hide the trash can.

These sets can include roasting pans, baking dishes, and casserole dishes.</p> <h3>Q. What is the coating on nonstick cookware?</h3> <p>The nonstick coating on traditional nonstick cookware is known as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or Teflon. This chemical treatment is safe at temperatures below 500 degrees, though if the cookware is regularly used between 400 to 500 degrees, it may begin to break down prematurely.</p> <h3>Q. What type of cookware set do I need?</h3> <p>The type of nonstick cookware set that is best for you depends on your personal cooking style, the number of people in a household, and the type of cooktop. Avoid aluminum, copper, and ceramic if you have an induction cooktop, and opt for larger sets of pots and pans for big families.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my cookware set last?</h3> <p>Nonstick cookware sets typically last about three to five years. These pots and pans should be replaced when you notice signs of pitting or peeling.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>While the kitchen is a place of creation, innovation, and delicious feasts that can bring the whole family together, it can be challenging to achieve great results when making favorite foods without a high-quality nonstick cookware set. Nonstick cookware products can be made of copper, aluminum, stainless steel, ceramic, or hard-anodized aluminum, but copper, aluminum, ceramic, and hard-anodized aluminum don’t work with induction cooktops.</p> <p>Beyond the right cooking vessel material, the handles and lids also can make or break a set.

However, these innovative devices can leave some people with a few questions. Take a look below to find answers to several commonly asked questions about electric grills.</p> <h3>Q. Can all electric grills be used indoors?</h3> <p>Due to the reliance on electricity as a fuel source, most electric grills can be used indoors without a problem, like an infrared electric grill that doesn’t produce harmful fumes and typically comes with a smoke-management system to reduce smoke indoors.

They won’t produce harmful fumes, and they typically come with a smoke-management system to reduce smoke and steam indoors.</p> <h3>Q. Do you need oil for an indoor grill?</h3> <p>Whether a grill needs oil or not depends more on the grate material than on whether it is an indoor or outdoor grill. Some indoor grills have nonstick coatings, so they don’t require oil, but grills with porcelain-coated cast iron need to be seasoned with oil.</p> <h3>Q. Which indoor grill is easiest to clean?</h3> <p>Grills that can fully come apart and be placed in the dishwasher with no damage to the grill plate, like the GoWISE USA 2-in-1 Smokeless Indoor Grill, are the easiest to clean. Just rinse or wipe off any large pieces of food left over from grilling, then place the dishwasher-safe parts in the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Indoor grills give users the option to enjoy grilled food all year long, regardless of the weather outside. They make a great addition to an indoor kitchen, and some can even be set up outdoors when the weather cooperates. Since indoor grills come in a broad range of sizes as well as indoor/outdoor, portable, and multicooker styles, consider how you plan to use the grill.</p> <p>Look for a large indoor/outdoor grill for big backyard barbecues, a smaller personal model for intimate breakfasts with your partner, or tabletop indoor grills to prepare food for the entire family.</p>",413

Sharpening steels (aka honing rods) can be wiped down with a damp cloth, while pull-through sharpeners can use a quick brushing with a mild brush. Washing and rinsing is never suggested.</p> <h3>Q. How long should a knife sharpener last?</h3> <p>A high-quality knife sharpener used properly can last for many years. The materials in the grinding wheels and rods don’t dull easIly, so a sharpener can remain effective and even outlast a set of kitchen knives.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>A knife sharpener can help revive older knives and make them easier (and safer) to use. Armed with helpful information on choosing the best kitchen knife sharpener and the choices on this list, you should be able to make a purchase that will safely and effectively sharpen your knives for years to come.</p>",337
303,blender,"<h3>Q: Why buy a new blender?</h3> <p>A: Purchasing a new blender periodically is essential. Because no matter how durable your mixer may be, its blades tend to get weaker and less sharp after every use. We recommend that you buy a new blender after several years to ensure that you receive better output and consistent textures with your sauces and dips.</p> <h3>Q: How long should a blender run?</h3> <p>A: During challenging tasks such as making nut butters, pastes, and thick dips, your blender should be used in short intervals of up to 30 seconds. This interval usage also helps prevent the overheating of the machine. Some of the tell-tale signs that the blender’s motor is under stress are when your device makes a high-pitched or grinding noise. In such an instance, it is advised that you add more liquid or call a timeout.</p> <h3>Q: Can blender blades break?</h3> <p>A: Blender blades are made mostly from sturdy and rugged metals so they don’t break easily. If you want to blend food with bones, don’t. This can cost you the performance of the machine which will lead you to invest in maintenance or a new blender.</p> <h3>Q: Can I put ice cubes in my blender?</h3> <p>A: Ice cubes can be crushed in any blender, provided its blades are sturdy enough. There are some blenders designed to accommodate the crushing of ice and others are not.</p>",233
304,under cabinet lighting,"<p>Check out the answers to the most common questions about under-cabinet lighting.</p> <h3>Q: How many under-cabinet lights do I need?</h3> <p>The number of under-cabinet lights you need will depend on the lumens per light produced, the type of light fixture, and the size of the room. In general, under-cabinet lighting should produce an average of 1000 to 2500 lumens for all surfaces that will be used for cooking or cutting. Other non-task-related areas for under-cabinet lighting don’t have lumen requirements, so you can choose as many or as few lights as you wish.</p> <h3>Q: Where should I place under-cabinet lighting?</h3> <p>When mounting any fixture under a cabinet, position it toward the front. If there is a lens, face it toward the backsplash. The bottom-front rail of the cabinet should hide the fixture from your line of sight, whether standing or seated. If it doesn’t, consider extending the rail with a narrow board or trim piece.</p> <h3>Q: How many lumens do I need for under-cabinet lighting?</h3> <p>The lumens for your under-cabinet lighting depend on where the lighting is being installed. Under-cabinet lighting for task-related areas like counters used for food preparation should have between 1000 to 2500 lumens to ensure you have plenty of light while cutting, peeling, chopping, or undertaking any other food prep activities. Under-cabinet lighting in the rest of the kitchen can range depending on your personal preferences.</p>",230
305,dishwasher detergent,"<p>You probably think using dishwasher detergent is pretty straightforward but some common misconceptions can cause issues. Below are some frequently asked questions about dishwasher detergent that can guide you toward better use.</p> <h3>Q. Is liquid or powder dishwasher detergent better?</h3> <p>Liquid or powder is a matter of personal preference. However, powder detergents contain both bleach and enzymes that effectively clean dishes. Liquid detergents will have one or the other but never both.</p> <h3>Q. Are dishwasher pods bad for your dishwasher?</h3> <p>No. Pods are designed to deliver precise amounts of detergent to your washer and completely dissolve.</p> <h3>Q. Why won’t my dishwasher detergent dissolve completely?</h3> <p>Your detergent may not completely dissolve because your water is hard or the water isn’t hot enough. Those with hard water should try sodium-based detergents.</p>",129
306,saucepan,"<h3>Q: What is a saucepan?</h3> <p>A: A saucepan is a round vessel with a single handle and a lid used on the stove top to heat, melt, cook, or boil liquids, and can be used for sauces, puddings, soups, rice, and more. Some saucepans are also rated for use in the oven for recipes that require finishing under a broiler or in surrounding heat. Saucepans generally come in a variety of sizes from 1-4 quarts. These pans are deep with vertical sides to contain liquids and prevent unwanted or rapid evaporation, and usually come with a lid to give the cook even more control over the level of moisture escaping the pan as it cooks. Made of durable, hard-working materials, saucepans are used for many purposes in the kitchen and are considered a staple of the well-stocked kitchen.</p> <h3>Q: Does the pan heat evenly?</h3> <p>A: It’s very important that a stove top pan transfers heat quickly and distributes it evenly, not just at the bottom of the pan, but up the sides as well. Hot spots or cold spots can cause a recipe to go terribly wrong. Most modern saucepans are made from materials designed or combined to produce even, well-distributed heat. Stainless steel and aluminum are two of the most commonly used materials, and are often combined to reap the benefits of aluminum’s excellent distribution and stainless steel’s wonderful heat transfer. Ceramic pans are slower to heat, but hold and distribute the heat evenly over a long period of time. Most concerns about uneven heat distribution arise from older pans that were not made of the consistent, carefully calibrated materials current manufacturers are using.</p> <h3>Q: Are the saucepans dishwasher safe?</h3> <p>A: Some saucepan manufacturers state that their pans are, in fact, dishwasher safe. If that is the case, then they are—but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you should wash them in the dishwasher. While a dishwasher may not destroy a coating or surface, the high heat and abrasive cleaners in a dishwasher cycle will naturally eat away at the coatings and finishes little by little and gradually erode them, reducing the lifespan of the pan and making it less effective. An occasional dishwasher cycle for a pan labeled as compatible is not the end of the world, but a thorough hand washing is always preferable. Anodized aluminum pans should never be cleaned in a dishwasher.</p> <h3>Q: Can my saucepan be used on an induction cooktop?</h3> <p>A: This is a concern for many shoppers buying pans prior to purchasing a new stove. Induction cooktops are extremely efficient, as long as the pans you’re using are made of a ferrous or magnetic metal. If not, the induction cooktop’s heat will not be drawn through the pan and will not heat the food within. Cast iron and most stainless steel pans are compatible. Aluminum and ceramic cookware are not, unless the manufacturer has added a layer of iron or stainless steel into the bottom of the pan that will allow the induction stove top to create a magnetic connection. If you have or plan to buy an induction stove top, look specifically for this information from the manufacturer: most cookware explicitly states whether or not it is induction-compatible.</p>",536
307,touchless kitchen faucet,"<h3>Q: How do touchless kitchen faucets work?</h3> <p>Touchless faucets consist of four main parts: a spout, sensor window, solenoid valve (a type of electromagnet), and power source. The sensor is activated when you place your hand or object near the sensor windows, and a signal is sent to the solenoid valve to open and allow water to flow through the spout.</p> <h3>Q: Does a touchless kitchen faucet require electricity?</h3> <p>Touchless faucets require a power source to control the sensors and solenoid valves. The power is typically in the form of batteries or AC transformers.</p> <h3>Q: Can a touchless kitchen faucet work manually?</h3> <p>Most touchless faucets have a manual sensor override mode, which allows the faucet to function as a regular faucet during a loss of power.</p> <h3>Q: How long should a touchless kitchen faucet last?</h3> <p>As with any product, it depends on the brand, materials, and how often you use it. Touchless faucets have more moving parts than regular versions, which can lead to more repairs.</p> <h3>Q: What are the best brands of kitchen faucets?</h3> <p>The top kitchen faucet brands are Moen, Kohler, and Delta Faucet as they excel in quality, customer service, and durability.</p>",195
308,electric grill,"<p>The best outdoor electric grills let you enjoy your favorite barbecue food without worrying about charcoal, natural gas, or propane. However, these innovative devices can still leave some people with a few questions. Take a look below to find answers to several commonly asked questions about electric grills.</p> <h3>Q. Can all electric grills be used indoors?</h3> <p>Due to the reliance on electricity as a fuel source, most electric grills can be used indoors without a problem, like an infrared electric grill that doesn’t produce harmful fumes and typically comes with a smoke-management system to reduce smoke indoors. Large outdoor electric grills may take up too much space in the kitchen. However, even these larger electric grills are not harmful to operate indoors.</p> <h3>Q. Can you preheat an electric grill?</h3> <p>The temperature control of an electric grill allows the user to preheat the grill in much the same way as the temperature control of a stove lets you preheat the stovetop burners.</p> <h3>Q. Can an extension cord be used to power an electric grill?</h3> <p>While an indoor electric grill can sit on the counter, close to a power outlet, an extension cord is typically necessary to provide power to an outdoor electric grill.</p> <h3>Q. Do electric grills leave grill marks?</h3> <p>The best electric grills often come with multiple grilling plates, so the user can decide between a flat griddle surface or a raised grill surface. With the raised grilling plate, even an indoor electric grill can leave grill marks on chicken, steak, and other common barbecue foods.</p> <h3>Q. Can you leave an electric grill outside?</h3> <p>It depends on the specific product, but an outdoor electric grill is typically designed to remain outside, though it’s a good idea to have a grill cover or a sheltered area to keep the outdoor grill out of the rain.</p> <h3>Q. Can an electric grill catch fire?</h3> <p>Fire risks exist for all types of grills. An outdoor electric grill can pose a hazard if it’s connected to a damaged extension cord or if any flammable materials get too close to the grilling surface or even the warming rack.</p>",352
309,manual can opener,"<h3>Q: How do you fix a manual can opener?</h3> <p>A: The most common problem with can openers is that they can get stuck or be difficult to rotate. You can use oil or cooking spray to lubricate the gears or wheels: spread a little over the working part of the tool, and it will work smoothly again. Do not use commercial lubricants, as they are not specifically food-safe.  If oiling doesn’t work, it’s possible that one of the gears that turns the handle is broken, in which case you should discard the opener and choose a new one.</p> <h3>Q: Can manual can openers be sharpened?</h3> <p>A: If you’re performing regular maintenance and keeping the can opener clean and dry, the wheel should remain sharp. If you find that your blade is skipping or seems dull, you can run a piece of folded aluminum foil or sandpaper through the sharpener several times: clamp between the wheels and rotate the handle to move the foil or sandpaper through, and the material will clean and sharpen the blade.</p>",175
310,kitchen faucet,"<p>If you’re still reading, you may have a few lingering questions about buying or installing a new faucet. Read on to learn more.</p> <h3>Q. Is a pull-out or pull-down kitchen faucet better?</h3> <p>Pull-out faucets require less headroom and make a good choice where cabinetry is installed above the sink. Pull-down faucets are often constructed in a high-arc or gooseneck pattern to provide more in-sink clearance for pots and pans and other large items.</p> <h3>Q. What type of faucet do plumbers recommend?</h3> <p>Plumbers recommend choosing a faucet from a quality brand, made of quality components. Some of the top brands include Delta, Moen, Kohler, and hansgrohe. Look for construction of brass, zinc alloy, or alloy steel for best results</p> <h3>Q. How long should a kitchen faucet last?</h3> <p>Kitchen faucets last 15 to 20 years on average, but quality of construction can increase or decrease the lifespan. Paying more for quality fixtures will save time, money, and materials compared with cheaply made products.</p>",161
311,dish soap,"<h3>Q: How does dish soap work?</h3> <p>A: Dish soaps contain surfactants, which soften the shell of liquids or semi-liquids in which they are dissolved. The soap breaks up particles and makes them slippery and easier to remove. On tough grease, the soap actually breaks apart the oil at a molecular level: the soap molecule has a hydrophilic end and a hydrophobic end. Oil is attracted to the hydrophobic end and water to the hydrophilic end, splitting the moisture apart from the oil and making it easy to sweep and rinse away. Some dish soaps also include antibacterial agents to kill any leftover bacteria and may include a rinse agent to prevent buildup on the dishes. All dish soaps are more effective when used with warm or hot water to help soften the debris to be removed.</p> <h3>Q: Are “green” dish detergents really better?</h3> <p>A: Eco-friendly cleaning products are absolutely better for the environment, but if they don’t work effectively, then you’re adding chemicals to the environment pointlessly. While it would be great to find completely chemical-free dish soap, the soap must have the power to really clean the dishes. Balancing that need against the desire for fewer chemicals can be tricky, but it can be done: the goal is to keep the chemicals that are necessary and eliminate those that are not.</p> <p>The best way to do this is to read the ingredient list. Ideally, you’ll see notations that the ingredients used are naturally derived, biodegradable, and nontoxic, and that the packaging is made from recyclable and/or sustainable materials. Avoid chemicals such as sodium lauryl sulfate, chlorine, phosphates, and triclosan, which have been determined to be potentially harmful. Products labeled “fragrance-free” or that specify the fragrances added are more likely to be environmentally friendly, as a lot of chemicals can be hidden in the terms ‘fragrance’ and ‘colorant.’ The more natural the ingredients, the greener the product is. It’s impossible to choose a product without any chemicals and expect it to clean dishes well, so you’re looking for a balance between the necessary chemicals and skipping the rest—resulting in fast, effective dish soap that’s healthy for your family and the environment.</p> <h3>Q: Will 1,4-dioxane in dish detergent harm me?</h3> <p>A: There has recently been some controversy surrounding the safety of 1,4 dioxane and its inclusion in dish detergent products. The concern is the apparent link between the chemical and cancer, and many scientists have confirmed that 1,4 dioxane can be carcinogenic.</p> <p>Scientists, however, have specified that to be carcinogenic, a person must be near to a concentrated form of the chemical and breathing it in for lengthy periods of time—such as working in a factory where it’s produced without wearing protective gear. In other words, the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in dish soap is far too low to be dangerous. The chemical is not dangerous to you at this level; however, some may choose to avoid products containing this chemical out of concern for those who are regularly exposed to it during production.</p>",502
312,salad spinners,"<h3>Q: What is a salad spinner and how does it work?</h3> <p>A: In terms of construction, salad spinners are basically a bowl fitted with a sieve that is slightly smaller, covered by a lid that houses a crank or turning mechanism. The sieve rests on a small knob or bump in the bottom of the bowl. When the button, crank, or pull strong is activated, the inner strainer begins to spin. Salad spinners use centrifugal force to fling water off of salad greens as the inner strainer spins around the central core. The water is collected in the bottom of the bowl to be poured off after spinning, leaving you with dry, fresh, crisp greens or vegetables.</p> <h3>Q: How much salad will a salad spinner hold?</h3> <p>A: Spinners come in different sizes, so the answer to this question depends on the size of the spinner you choose. Regardless of how much the spinner WILL hold, it is important to consider how much the spinner SHOULD hold: an overloaded spinner will damage the leaves and potentially break. If you’re packing in your leaves, you’ve added too much—the greens should be lightly piled into the strainer. Depending on the size of your spinner and how many greens you have to wash and dry, you may need to spin several smaller batches to protect your leaves from damage.</p> <h3>Q: How should I maintain my salad spinner?</h3> <p>A: Most salad spinner bowls are dishwasher safe, while the lids are more likely to be handwash only to protect the springs and strings that power the spinner. That said, most spinner bowls are easy to wipe clean by hand, and some clear plastic bowls might be damaged by the abrasive nature of dishwasher detergents, so hand washing is recommended overall.</p> <p>More important than how you wash the spinner is how you dry it. Most spinners have metal parts inside the spinner mechanism, while some have strings. The spinners are reasonably airtight when closed, so it’s critical that you thoroughly dry all parts of the spinner before reassembling for storage—including seams and edges that might hide water. Otherwise, your spinner could develop rust or mold.</p>",358

The most effective way to grease a muffin pan is with a pastry brush.</p>",137
330,glass food storage containers,"<p>Glass food storage containers offer a safe way to store, reheat, and preserve food. However, there are a few tricks for their best use. We’ve answered a few common questions to kick-start your journey to fresher food.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sterilize glass food storage containers?</h3> <p>Glass food storage containers are dishwasher safe for easy cleaning and sterilization. However, the lids may need to be boiled or hand-washed, depending on the material. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to make sure you don’t damage the lid or its sealing mechanism.</p> <h3>Q. Are glass food storage containers safe?</h3> <p>Glass food storage containers are usually safer than plastic for a couple of reasons. They aren’t porous like plastic, so they can heat and reheat in the microwave and, sometimes, the oven without chemicals leaching into the food. For the same reason, glass also resists staining and doesn’t absorb odors like plastic or metal.</p> <h3>Q. Do glass containers keep food fresh longer?</h3> <p>Glass containers don’t necessarily keep food fresher longer. The length of freshness depends on the effectiveness of the lid’s seal. However, glass doesn’t pose a threat of leaching; is easier to clean; and can be used in the fridge, freezer, microwave, and oven without damaging the container or changing the flavor of the food.</p> <p>A word of caution—the container lids are usually made of plastic, metal, or wood, which may have different care instructions than the glass container. For example, plastic cannot go in the microwave or oven, nor should metal.</p>",248
331,mini fridge,"<h3>Q: How do you defrost a mini fridge? </h3> <p>Mini fridges that include freezer compartments tend to develop frost over time, which can affect the taste of the food. Some models come with a self-defrost button, but if yours doesn’t, defrost it by removing the contents, unplugging the unit, and placing a thick towel on the bottom of the fridge compartment; then leave the door(s) open for at least 8 hours. When the frost has completely melted, wipe down the fridge’s interior and plug it back in to cool.</p> <h3>Q: How many watts does a mini fridge use?</h3> <p>Newer mini fridges that are Energy Star–rated (look for the Energy Star logo) may use as little as 100 to 200 watts of electricity. Less-efficient mini fridges may use double that amount.</p> <h3>Q: How much does a mini fridge cost to run?</h3> <p>The exact cost will depend on the fridge’s quality, how efficient it is, and the going rate for electricity in your area, but, in general, expect to pay between $27 and $47 per year to run the fridge.</p> <h3>Q: How do you fix a mini fridge that won’t get cold?</h3> <p>First, check to ensure the unit is plugged in and that the circuit breaker hasn’t flipped. Then, check the temperature adjustment dial to ensure it’s at the right temp. Frost buildup can make a unit run poorly, so defrost it if necessary. If these steps don’t help, consult your owner’s manual or contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean a mini fridge?</h3> <p>Wipe down the interior of the fridge with a rag dampened with plain warm water. Avoid spraying cleaners into the fridge, which can leave a chemical smell that affects the food’s taste.</p>",284
332,bottle opener,"<p>Now that you know what to look for in the best bottle openers, some questions may have come up. Below is a collection of the most frequently asked questions and answers about bottle openers. While your bottle opener will probably come with a set of instructions, you may find additional answers here.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a bottle opener?</h3> <p>A bottle opener uses leverage to loosen the crimps around a bottle cap. Position the opener under the crimps and lift the bottle opener to pry the top from the bottle’s rim.</p> <h3>Q. How does a bottle opener act as a lever?</h3> <p>Lever-style bottle openers use a lip to catch the crimp on the edge of a cap. The part of the opener that sits on top of the cap acts as a fulcrum (or the pivot point of a lever), while the handle acts as a point of leverage (hence the word “lever”). Force applied to the lever transfers to the fulcrum. The fulcrum changes the direction of the force, lifting the crimps from the bottle’s rim.</p> <h3>Q. How do you mount a bottle opener on a wall?</h3> <p>Use the included hardware and a power drill to screw the bottle opener to the wall. If attaching it to drywall, be sure to find a stud first. Repeated bottle opening can weaken the drywall or tear out the screws if they aren’t sinked into studs.</p>",235
333,over the range microwave,"<p>If you still have questions about over-the-range microwaves, then keep reading to find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Can any microwave go over the range?</h3> <p>A microwave should not go over a range unless it’s specifically designed to serve as an over-the-range model. An over-the-range microwave includes a vent.</p> <h3>Q: Can a microwave go above a gas range?</h3> <p>All over-the-range microwave ovens can be installed above a gas range as long as they meet the minimum 66-inch mounting height from the floor to the top of the microwave.</p> <h3>Q: Do over-the-range microwaves vent well?</h3> <p>An over-the-range microwave with a powerful 400-cubic-feet-per-minute fan may never vent as well as a vent hood. A hood has a much larger capture area than a microwave ventilation system. Ventilation hoods also are more powerful, with fans that are 900 cubic feet per minute and greater.</p> <h3>Q: How long should an over-the-range microwave last? </h3> <p>An over-the-range microwave will usually last about 10 years, depending on how well it’s maintained. Keeping the interior clean by wiping it down after spills helps extend its life. Make sure to use the fan when cooking on the stovetop to prevent moisture from building up on the microwave’s components. Never put anything in the microwave that could damage it.</p>",214

Consider the answers to some commonly asked questions about kitchen cleaners below.</p> <h3>Q. How do you degrease kitchen surfaces?</h3> <p>Apply a surface-appropriate cleaner to the soiled area, let dwell, and use a sponge or cloth to scrub the grease away. Avoid using any sharp implements, like a knife, to scrape the grease off as this could scratch or otherwise damage kitchen surfaces.</p> <h3>Q. Can you clean kitchen surfaces with bleach?</h3> <p>Bleach is an effective disinfectant, but it doesn’t clean. Pre-clean with a soap or detergent product, follow with bleach to disinfect, and then rinse thoroughly with water to remove bleach residue.</p> <h3>Q. How do you get burnt on grease off a stove?</h3> <p>For stubborn grease, let the deep cleaner sit on the affected area for 10 minutes before scrubbing. Repeat as necessary.</p>",156
335,induction cooktop,"<p>Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about induction cooktops.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between an induction and electric cooktop? </h3> <p>Electric cooktops heat up using an electric coil and directly transfer heat thermally to your pots and pans. Induction cooktops, on the other hand, use electromagnetism to transfer heat to your cookware via a magnetic field.</p> <h3>Q. Do induction cooktops require more power than electric ones? </h3> <p>Induction cooktops actually use 10 percent less energy than conventional electric cooktops.</p> <h3>Q. Can induction cooktops interfere with other electronics?</h3> <p>It is possible that induction cooktops could interfere with other electronics. For example, those using induction cooktops may require an analog cooking thermometer rather than a digital one to reduce the risk of the electromagnetic field causing the thermometer to deliver an incorrect result.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need special cookware for an induction cooktop?</h3> <p>Induction cooktops are only compatible with certain types of cookware. As a general rule, you can use your existing stainless steel and cast-iron cookware with an induction cooktop. Induction cooktops, however, are not compatible with copper, aluminum, or ceramic cooking vessels.</p> <h3>Q. Do induction cooktops scratch easily? </h3> <p>Most induction cooktops feature glass tops, like modern electric cooktops. They are built to be strong and are not easily scratched, but they can potentially be damaged by certain types of cookware.</p> <h3>Q. How long do induction cooktops last? </h3> <p>Most induction cooktops have a lifespan of approximately 2,500 hours. This translates to a lifespan similar to that of other large appliances—10 to 15 years.</p>",253
336,knife block,"<p>With so many choices available, shopping for the best knife block can be a bit overwhelming. If you still have some lingering questions, these answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about knife storage may help.</p> <h3>Q. Are knife blocks sanitary?</h3> <p>Whether a knife block is sanitary or not depends on the style of knife block. Because ease of cleaning varies depending on the type of knife storage solution you choose, some blocks are more sanitary than others. Traditional wooden knife blocks are the least sanitary because they can more easily accumulate dirt and food particles, and the knife slots can be difficult to clean.</p> <h3>Q. Are magnets bad for knives?</h3> <p>Magnetic knife strips are used in many professional kitchens and should not damage your knives. A good rule of thumb when using magnetic storage is to avoid forceful contact by touching the spine of your knife to the magnet first, rather than the blade.</p> <h3>Q. How do you put knives in a knife block?</h3> <p>In order to avoid dulling the blades of your knives, it’s important to put pressure on the spine of your knife, rather than the blade, when sliding it into a slot in a knife block. If your knife block allows for it, it’s actually ideal to slide your knives in upside down, so that the spines are on the bottom.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a knife block?</h3> <p>The cleaning method depends on the style of knife block. Traditional wooden knife blocks, which are difficult to clean, should be held upside down and shaken to release crumbs and debris that may have accumulated inside. The block can then be handwashed with soapy water. A pipe cleaner or baby bottle brush may help clean inside the slots.</p>",293
337,paella pan,"<p>If you still have questions about how to choose the best paella pan for your cookware collection, the following commonly asked questions may help.</p> <h3>Q. What is a paella pan?</h3> <p>A traditional paella pan is a wide, shallow frying pan with curved sides and two handles. It is used to cook paella, a rice-based dish from Spain that features meat, seafood and/or vegetables.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for in a paella pan?</h3> <p>When shopping for a paella pan, look for a product that is wide, shallow, and has a flat bottom. Materials like carbon steel, enameled steel, and stainless steel are ideal for making paella.</p> <h3>Q. Can a paella pan be used for daily cooking? </h3> <p>Products marketed as paella pans can certainly be used to cook things other than paella, including eggs, stir-fried dishes, and sautéed or seared meats and vegetables.</p> <h3>Q. Can a paella pan go in the oven?</h3> <p>Most paella pans are oven-safe if they are made from carbon steel, stainless steel, cast iron, or enameled steel. Nonstick pans, however, should not be used in the oven.</p> <h3>Q. Does a paella pan need a lid?</h3> <p>Paella pans typically do not come with lids because most paella recipes call for the ingredients to be cooked uncovered to allow liquids to evaporate. Some paella pans and many frying pans come with lids anyway, which allows you to use them for a number of other dishes.</p>",236
338,range hoods,"<p>If you still have questions about how to choose the best range hood for your home, the following frequently asked questions may help.</p> <h3>Q: What should I look for in a range hood?</h3> <p>First, decide whether a ducted or ductless range hood is most suitable for your kitchen. If shopping for a ducted range hood, look for one that has a CFM of at least 300 to ensure optimal air circulation.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best CFM for a range hood?</h3> <p>A CFM of at least 300 is suitable for most kitchens with electric ranges, while a CFM of at least 800 is preferable for those with gas stoves.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best height for a range hood?</h3> <p>A range hood should be installed so that there are 18 to 30 inches between your stovetop and the bottom of the range hood. The manufacturer will stipulate the ideal height for each specific range hood in the instruction manual.</p> <h3>Q: What is a convertible range hood?</h3> <p>A convertible range hood is a vented range hood that can be adapted to recirculate air rather than venting it to the outdoors.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a ductless range hood with a gas stove?</h3> <p>Gas stoves require more powerful range hoods because of their high energy output, but a high-quality ductless option can be sufficient if the ducted variety is not an option.</p> <h3>Q: Can a range hood be vented through the wall?</h3> <p>Yes. If your range hood is installed on an exterior wall, vents can be installed to allow for outdoor ventilation.</p>",260
339,french presses,"<p>Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about French presses.</p> <h3>Q. How do you make coffee using a French press?</h3> <p>To make coffee using a French press, add medium-ground coffee to the carafe, then pour hot water over it. Insert the plunger, letting it rest above the water line. After 4 minutes, press down slowly. Pour out the coffee into a mug or other vessel—coffee should not remain in the press.</p> <h3>Q. How much coffee do you use in a French press?</h3> <p>How much coffee you use in a French press depends on your personal preference. To produce 34 ounces of coffee, you’ll need approximately 4 to 5 level tablespoons of grounds.</p> <h3>Q. Is French press coffee stronger than drip coffee?</h3> <p>Because the filter screens used in French presses are more porous than standard coffee filters, the flavor of French press coffee is more robust. That doesn’t, however, mean it contains more caffeine.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean my French press?</h3> <p>All components of a French press should be washed after every use. If it’s dishwasher-friendly, it can simply be disassembled and put in your washer. Alternately, French presses can be hand washed with warm soapy water and then thoroughly dried.</p>",202
340,wall oven,"<p>Now that you’ve learned about the types of wall ovens and explored the top picks, here are some frequently asked questions and answers about wall ovens to help you on your shopping journey.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a wall oven?</h3> <p>When choosing the best wall oven for your kitchen, consider your cooking preferences, available space, and budget.</p> <h3>Q. Are wall ovens better than range ovens?</h3> <p>There are pros and cons to each type of oven. Wall ovens are more difficult to install and maintain, but they have a streamlined appearance. They are also usually located at eye level, which makes them easier to access. Range ovens come with a built-in cooktop and are usually more affordable.</p> <h3>Q. Does a wall oven need to be vented?</h3> <p>Wall ovens do not require venting to the outside, but they do contain internal vents that allow excess heat to escape.</p> <h3>Q. How much clearance do you need for a wall oven?</h3> <p>You should leave 3 inches of space (height, width, and depth) between the oven and adjacent cabinets.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I run a self-clean feature on my oven?</h3> <p>This varies by model and how often you use your oven. Always check the manufacturer’s guide that comes with your oven. Typically, you should only run the self-clean feature about five times per year, or when your oven is extremely dirty and in need of a deep clean. Otherwise, you can use specific cleaning products to manually clean your oven.</p> <h3>Q. How long do ovens usually last?</h3> <p>Ovens usually last for 13 to 15 years before needing to be replaced. If your oven is still fairly new and isn’t working properly, try fixing it first.</p>",282
341,freezer,"<p>You might still have questions about which is the best freezer for you. Though you can narrow the options down by type, size, capacity, and location, you might still have questions about whether frost-free is best, how long you can keep frozen foods in a freezer, and more. Here are some of the pertinent points you need to know before you have that new freezer delivered and installed.</p> <h3>Q: Are frost-free freezers better?</h3> <p>That depends. Frost-free freezers have a self-defrost system that periodically cycles to avoid ice buildup. The problem is that some of these freezers can fluctuate in temperature during those cycles. If that’s a problem for you, going with a freezer you must manually defrost could be a better option.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a freezer and a deep freezer?</h3> <p>These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, though some consider a chest freezer to be a “deep freezer”—likely because the chest freezer has the capacity to hold frozen foods several feet deep, while a typical upright freezer makes food much easier to access.</p> <h3>Q: How long can I keep my food frozen?</h3> <p>That depends on the frozen foods. Some foods, like bacon, can be frozen for a month before the taste might be compromised; others, such as steaks, can be frozen for up to a year with no compromise on taste as long as they were packaged properly before freezing. To learn more, see the Cold Food Storage Chart at FoodSafety.gov.</p> <h3>Q: How do you defrost a freezer?</h3> <p>If your freezer has an auto-defrost function, you don’t have to worry about this; the appliance does it all on its own. If you’re going to manually defrost the freezer, this step-by-step guide on How to Defrost a Freezer tells you everything you need to know.</p> <h3>Q: How long do freezers last?</h3> <p>Most manufacturers say their freezers last for up to 20 years, but the average lifespan seems to be around 11 years. You can increase your freezer’s longevity with proper maintenance, including defrosting on a regular basis and ensuring there is never more than a quarter-inch of frost in the freezer.</p>",353
342,wine coolers,"<p>If you’re still wondering about how wine coolers work, look below for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these specialty appliances.</p> <h3>Q. How does a wine cooler work?</h3> <p>Most wine coolers use a compressor that’s similar to that of a refrigerator to cool its interior. Most wine coolers have adjustable thermostats that allow you to set the optimal temperature—usually around 55 degrees—for storing your wine.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a wine cooler, wine refrigerator, and wine cellar?</h3> <p>Wine coolers and wine refrigerators function in the same way. They both store wines at temperatures between 45 and 65 degrees. Wine refrigerators are larger and can hold 150 bottles of wine or more. Wine coolers are smaller, housing between a dozen and 50 bottles of wine. A wine cellar is a storage room, typically located below ground, that can hold hundreds of bottles. Wine cellars use a climate-control system to keep temperatures between 45 and 64 degrees and humidity at around 60 percent.</p> <h3>Q. What is the temperature range of a wine cooler?</h3> <p>A typical wine cooler has a temperature range of between 45 and 65 degrees. This allows for chilling wine for storage at the optimal temperature of 55 degrees. This broad range also lets you chill white wines to cooler temperatures and red wines to warmer temperatures for proper serving.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a wine cooler?</h3> <p>Most wine is stored in a wine cooler horizontally as opposed to vertically. This position prevents the cork from drying out, which would allow air to enter the bottle and ruin the wine. A thermostat on the wine cooler lets you fine-tune the internal cooling temperature.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a wine cooler last?</h3> <p>A wine cooler, like a standard refrigerator, can last anywhere from 10 to 20 years, depending on the quality of the unit and how well it is maintained.</p>",316

What is a chef knife good for?</h3> <p>You can use a chef knife for mincing, slicing, and chopping veggies, as well as slicing meat.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a chef’s knife and a Santoku knife?</h3> <p>A Santoku knife is designed for precision and thin cutting, while a chef knife is multipurpose in use.</p> <h3>Q. How big should a chef’s knife be?</h3> <p>Chef knives are between 6 and 10 inches long.</p> <h3>Q. How do you properly clean a knife?</h3> <p>You can clean a knife with soap and water, and most are also dishwasher safe. Check the label before washing.</p>",152
344,slow cooker,"<p>As with any new appliance, you may need some time to learn your way around it. We’ve answered some of the most common questions to get you started.</p> <h3>Q. How does a slow cooker work?</h3> <p>Slow cookers allow you to leave food cooking at low temperatures, unattended, for long periods of time. You can put in your ingredients in the morning and find dinner waiting for you that evening. The heating element that holds the pot is in the base of the slow cooker. A lid fits on top of the pot.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a slow cooker?</h3> <p>Slow cookers are simple to use. You place the food inside the cooker then set the temperature. On many models, your only choices are low and high. You’ll either time the meal yourself or set a built-in timer. Meals may cook anywhere from two to ten or more hours, depending on the volume of food and the temperature at which you cook it. Most of the time you don’t need to check it—the definition of a set-it-and-forget-it meal.</p> <h3>Q. What temperature is low on a slow cooker?</h3> <p>Most slow cookers have a low setting of 190-degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <h3>Q. Can you put raw meat in a slow cooker?</h3> <p>Slow cookers can handle raw meat, though some recipes call for browning or searing the meat before putting it in the slow cooker.</p> <h3>Q. How much liquid do you put in a slow cooker?</h3> <p>Recipes designed for slow cookers will make any liquid adjustments for you. If you’re using a recipe that’s not designed for a slow cooker, you usually need to reduce the liquid a little. The general rule of thumb is that the liquid should barely cover the meat and vegetables. The slow cooker should not be more than 3/4 full including the food and any added liquid. As the ingredients expand or release juices, the slow cooker could overflow if you fill it too full.</p> <h3>Q. Can a slow cooker catch fire?</h3> <p>Fires aren’t impossible, but they’re extremely rare. If you follow good cooking practices and the owner’s manual, you shouldn’t have any problems. Slow cookers have feet that raise the heating element off of the countertop, so there’s no direct contact. And, as long as both the slow cooker’s and your home’s electrical systems are in good working order, you shouldn’t have a problem. However, all-electric appliances come with some fire risk.</p>",403
345,whiskey stone,"<p>If you still have some lingering questions about whiskey stones, check out our list of frequently asked questions to get on the fast track to the best whiskey stones for you.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use whiskey stones?</h3> <p>Simply freeze them for a minimum of four hours and drop them in your drink. Whiskey stones add chill without dilution or unwanted flavors.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take whiskey stones to chill my drink?</h3> <p>A few seconds. Like ice cubes, whiskey stones disseminate lower temperature through your drink on contact. Give the glass a little swirl and wait a minute to ensure your beverage is as cold as you want it to be.</p> <h3>Q. Can whiskey stones be used in other drinks?</h3> <p>Absolutely. Whiskey stones work in any drink you want cold. However, the flavor of other drinks may soak into the stones. If you make a habit of switching between beverages, follow proper cleaning practices to cleanse the flavor from your stones.</p> <h3>Q. Which whiskey stones won’t scratch my glass?</h3> <p>The Mohs scale measures the hardness of minerals. Glass ranks between 5.5 and 7 on the Mohs scale. Anything higher than 7 on the Mohs scale may scratch glass. Soapstone, stainless steel and granite have a 2.5, 6 to 7, and 5.5 to 6 Mohs ranking, respectively.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean whiskey stones?</h3> <p>Whiskey stones are dishwasher safe and should be cleaned with dish soap and warm water after every use.

363,convection oven,"<p>It takes some trial and error at first, but cooking with convection can change your cooking habits for the better. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions for diagnosing oven issues and learning how to use convection ovens correctly.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a convection oven and a regular oven?</h3> <p>A convection oven has a fan and exhaust system that pushes and pulls air through the oven. The resulting air circulation maintains an even cooking temperature that reduces cooking times. Conventional ovens rely on heat alone rather than heat and air circulation.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best countertop convection oven to buy?</h3> <p>While there are many great countertop convection ovens on the market, the Breville BOV800XL Smart Oven is a definite standout. This oven has 10 cooking functions and an Element IQ system that maintains temperatures with a fan and five independently adjustable quartz heating elements.</p> <h3>Q: Does a convection oven fan run continuously?</h3> <p>The fan will run continuously as long as the oven is on the convection setting. It will turn off if the oven door is opened. Some models allow you to manually turn the convection setting on or off, which turns the fan on or off as well. That allows you to choose the cooking environment that’s best for the dish you’re cooking.</p> <h3>Q: How do I clean my convection oven?</h3> <p>Convection ovens can be cleaned just like conventional ovens. Remove the racks or any other accessories and wash them with soap and water. Use an oven cleaning solution inside the oven to remove grease and buildup. Scrub spills, and return the racks to the oven when they’re clean and dry.</p> <h3>Q: What shouldn’t I cook in my convection oven?</h3> <p>Flan, souffles, cakes, and breads don’t do well in convection. The moving air can cause some foods like souffles to collapse. Cakes and breads often dehydrate on the inside due to the circulating air, which is why they taste better when baked in a conventional oven.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of cookware can be used in a convection oven?</h3> <p>You can use ceramic, glass, aluminum, and clay cookware in a convection oven. Cookware that’s thinner often works better because the heat can reach the food from all angles. You may also want to use pans and cookie sheets with lower sides to put as much of the food as possible in direct contact with the heat.</p>",402

Can you use stainless steel utensils on non-stick cookware?</h3> <p>This is not a good idea. Stainless steel utensils can easily damage the layer of material that makes your non-stick cookware—well, non-stick. Opt for vinyl, wood, or silicone to keep your cookware looking great.</p> <h3>Q. Why do chefs use wooden spoons?</h3> <p>Wooden spoons can be used on any type of cookware, have unmatched longevity, and don’t transfer heat as readily as other types of materials. That’s why you’ll see wooden spoons not only used as cooking utensils but as small tasting spoons in professional kitchens.</p> <h3>Q.

Beyond that, BPA-free silicone that can withstand high temperatures is your best bet.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best way to store my kitchen utensils?</h3> <p>That depends upon your style and how much room you have.

Measure the width, depth, and height of the available space to make sure the electric range you purchase will fit, since ranges can vary in width from 20 inches to 40 inches. Also, consider how much you’re willing to spend. Electric ranges can vary in price from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the features of the model.</p> <h3>Q: Which range is better: freestanding, slide-in, or built-in electric? </h3> <p>This largely depends on what you need. Freestanding ranges are considered the lower end and typically don’t offer the same power and features of a more expensive built-in or slide-in range. If you’re an avid cook, it may be worth it to invest in a more expensive model. Most home cooks, though, will do just fine with a more affordable freestanding range.</p> <h3>Q: Can I plug an electric stove into a regular outlet? </h3> <p>Electric stoves use significantly more energy than the 1,800-maximum wattage that a standard 110-volt outlet can provide. As such, they require a 220-volt outlet for power.</p> <h3>Q: How long do electric ranges last?</h3> <p>An electric range will last about 13 years on average. Frequent cleaning may extend the life of the device</p>",293

Can you use tea bags in a tea infuser? </h3> <p>Yes, you can theoretically use tea bags in a tea infuser. However, because tea bags are essentially mini tea infusers, it’s not necessary to put them in an infuser.</p> <h3>Q. Does tea get stronger the longer it steeps? </h3> <p>Most teas have a recommended steeping time. If you steep them for longer, they may become bitter, but they won’t get any stronger. For stronger tea, add more tea leaves or additional bags to your brewing process.</p> <h3>Q. Why should you not squeeze a tea bag? </h3> <p>Tea aficionados agree that you should never squeeze a tea bag or press it against the side of your cup with a spoon.

Ahead, several of the most common queries about baking sheets are answered to provide additional guidance.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a baking sheet and a cookie sheet?</h3> <p>Cookie sheets are frequently referred to as baking sheets, but a distinct difference exists. Baking sheets, which can also be referred to as baking pans, typically feature rimmed edges. Cookie sheets have rimmed edges on only the short sides and feature flat—or rimless—edges on the long sides, allowing you to slide cookies off the sheet without disrupting their shape by trying to lift them with a spatula.</p> <h3>Q. How many baking sheets do you need?</h3> <p>For most households, two or three baking sheets will suffice. A variety of baking sheets in different sizes will then provide a certain flexibility for baking a multitude of foods.</p> <h3>Q. Can baking sheets go in the dishwasher?</h3> <p>This depends on the material used for the baking sheet. Steel baking sheets are generally safe in the dishwasher, but remember to wash pure aluminum and cast-iron baking sheets by hand. Always refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for recommendations about washing your baking sheets.</p> <h3>Q. How long do baking sheets last?</h3> <p>The material used to make a baking sheet will dictate how long it lasts. Steel and steel-covered baking sheets last longer than aluminum baking sheets, which are prone to warping. Cast-iron baking sheets typically last the longest. Nonstick coatings are useful but can be scratched off by metal utensils.</p>",252

Do bread boxes keep bread from molding? </h3> <p>Most bread boxes are designed to preserve bread over time, but they won’t keep mold away indefinitely. Certain products are designed with vents or air holes to provide air circulation and keep the humidity at the right level to discourage mold growth.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for in a bread box?</h3> <p>Choose a bread box that is appropriately sized for the storage needs of your household. If you want to preserve bread over several days, as opposed to just a day or two, look for a bread box with ventilation. Consider whether you want features like a clear window for checking the quality of your loaves and top storage for kitchen items. Keep in mind whether you prefer stainless steel, plastic, wood, or ceramic; noting that wood designs are unsuitable for humid climates, and ceramic bread boxes do not contain ventilation.</p>",202

If you are baking something at a temperature higher than this, do not put parchment paper on your stone.</p> <h3>Q. Do you oil a pizza stone?</h3> <p>The porous surface of stone, clay, and cordierite pizza stones should not be oiled. The oil may smoke or burn on the stone. While some may believe using oil will help to season a stone and help it develop a nonstick surface more quickly, it’s best to allow the pizza stone to get naturally seasoned over time.</p>",265

What size casserole dish do I need?</h3> <p>The best casserole dish size for you will vary based on what you are cooking and how much food you are planning to make. Your recipe may also suggest a specific-size casserole dish. For example, lasagna is typically made in a 9- by 13-inch casserole dish, which holds 3 quarts.</p> <h3>Q. What can I use instead of a casserole dish?</h3> <p>If you don’t have a casserole dish, you may be able to find a substitute item in your kitchen. Alternatives with a lid include an oven-safe saucepan or a Dutch oven. If you have a slow cooker with a removable pot, you can use the pot as a casserole dish.

409,air fryer toaster oven,"<h3>Q: How does air frying work? </h3> <p>Air fryer appliances are essentially mini convection ovens. Food is placed in an internal basket or on a pan, sheet, or rack. When the air fryer is switched on, heating elements create hot air that a fan system circulates around the food, which makes items crisp on the outside, without drying out the inside. They do require cooking foods in oil like typical deep fryers.</p> <h3>Q: Can you air fry in a regular toaster oven? </h3> <p>If the toaster oven has a convection setting, it can air-fry food.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between an air fryer and an air fryer toaster oven? </h3> <p>Air fryer toaster ovens tend to be more affordable, more versatile, have a larger capacity—and can air-fry foods just as well as a regular air fryer. There are few reasons to choose an air fryer over an air fryer toaster oven. Both can air fry foods, and an air fryer toaster oven can do much more.</p> <p>Air fryers are a trendy appliance that pretty much repackages convection baking into an attractive design and smaller footprint. Choose an air fryer if you want a compact option (but keep in mind the smaller capacity).</p> <h3>Q: Do air fryer toaster ovens work as well as regular air fryers? </h3> <p>Absolutely—they often work even better than regular air fryers. Air fryer toaster ovens and regular air fryers both use the same convection baking method to heat food. Air fryer toaster ovens tend to be more affordable than trendy air fryers and usually heat food from the top and bottom (compared to heating from only the top in a pod-like air fryer).</p> <p>Air fryer toaster ovens also tend to have a larger internal capacity, so you can cook multiple portions without overcrowding the pan or basket (which can make food soggy). One benefit of regular air fryers is their smaller size (and smaller footprint), which can allow them to cook faster than larger toaster ovens.</p> <h3>Q: What are the best foods to cook in a toaster oven air fryer?</h3> <p>Any foods for which you want a bit of crisp and crunch cook great in a toaster oven air fryer, especially if you want to use less oil. For example, french fries, crispy roasted veggies, roast chicken, breaded chicken, salmon, bacon, and much more. Since toaster oven air fryers also have the functions of a regular toaster oven, they’re also excellent for heating the foods you’d throw in a regular toaster oven, like toast, baked goods, and pizzas.</p>",419
410,cookie press,"<p>Here are some frequently asked questions and answers about cookie presses.</p> <h3>Q.

They also require less exertion than manual cookie presses.</p> <h3>Q. What causes a cookie press to stop working?</h3> <p>A cookie press can stop working if you are using a nonstick surface because the dough will get stuck in the press instead of sticking to the surface to which you are extruding, such as a baking sheet.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a cookie press? </h3> <p>Hand-washing is recommended for cookie presses, especially if they’re made of metal.</p>",122
411,carbon steel wok,"<p>Still have questions about carbon steel woks? Here’s a little more information to help you decide on the best carbon steel wok for you.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best type of wok?</h3> <p>The best woks for traditional Asian cooking are round-bottom, carbon steel woks with a long wooden handle. Hand-hammered woks made in China are popular because you can see the individual hammer marks in the steel, which gives them an authentic appearance.</p> <p>Hand-hammered and machine-made woks have similar cooking performance. Choosing a handmade wok is more about the cooking experience and feel.</p> <h3>Q: Is a carbon steel wok better than a cast-iron wok?</h3> <p>Professional chefs generally prefer carbon steel woks to cast-iron ones because carbon steel weighs less and maneuvers more easily. Cooking stir-fries requires moving, lifting, and shifting the pan to toss vegetables and meats for even cooking; it can be tough to do that with a heavy cast-iron wok.</p> <p>The two materials have a lot in common. Both absorb and hold heat well, are durable, and resist warping. But, if not properly seasoned and cared for, both materials are also prone to rust.</p> <h3>Q: Is it safe to use a carbon steel wok?</h3> <p>Yes. A carbon steel wok gets its nonstick properties from oil residue left by cooking, so there’s no chemical coating to chip or flake into food. You need to season a carbon steel wok before its first use. Over time and with regular seasoning, carbon steel builds up a nonstick surface, becoming easier to clean the more you use it.</p>",256

Unlike some other types of cookware, ceramic cookware does not give off potentially harmful fumes, even when it is used at high temperatures.</p> <h3>Q. Which is better: ceramic-coated or Teflon?</h3> <p>Ceramic-coated pans are better for you and the environment since they are free of toxins, but they are not as durable as traditional nonstick-coated Teflon pans.</p> <h3>Q. Do you have to pretreat ceramic frying pans?</h3> <p>Most ceramic frying pans do not need to be pretreated, but some manufacturers recommend seasoning before the first use and a couple of times per year to strengthen the ceramic nonstick coating.</p>",149

How should I store my pizza cutter?</h3> <p>Some pizza cutters have blade covers that protect them from nicks. These types can be stored in a regular utensil drawer or knife drawer. Those without a cover require more careful storage to maintain the blade’s edge. Some can fit in a knife organizer. Another option is to make a cover of your own, using craft foam or wood. If that’s not an option, store it in a drawer between two pot holders to protect the edge and your hands.</p>",255

Which gas stove brands are most reliable?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, gas stoves and cooktops last longer than electric cooktops, with an average lifespan of 15 years compared to 13 years. That said, some manufacturers are known for their reliable and long-lasting gas or dual-fuel ranges and cooktops. Some of these top brands include KitchenAid, Frigidaire, and Empava.</p> <h3>Q. How do you install a gas cooktop?</h3> <p>Before installing a gas cooktop, it is important to ensure that it has been set up for the type of gas fuel that will be used. Check with the requirements from your manufacturer before converting the fuel type or attempting to install the cooktop yourself; some manufacturers state that these tasks must be completed by a trained technician or licensed professional.</p> <p>If attempting to install the cooktop yourself, follow the steps below:</p> <ul><li>Turn the outdoor gas shutoff valve to the off position.</li><li>Remove the existing cooktop.</li><li>Confirm that the new cooktop fits in the existing opening.</li><li>Connect the electrical supply.</li><li>Connect the gas supply.</li><li>Check for gas leaks</li><li>Install the seals and gaskets provided by the manufacturer.</li><li>Turn the gas supply back on and check again for leaks.</li></ul> <h3>Q. Do gas cooktops use electricity?</h3> <p>Yes, while a gas stove doesn’t use as much electricity as an electric cooktop, it does still use electricity. Gas cooktops have electric ignition systems along with the gas pilot light. A key difference between gas and electric stoves, however, is that you can still cook on a gas cooktop in the event of a power outage. You’ll just need to use a match to light the burners very carefully.</p> <h3>Q. Do gas cooktops need to be vented?</h3> <p>Yes, gas cooktops should be vented. Proper venting helps minimize smoke, gas byproducts, steam, and dirt from the air.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a gas cooktop?</h3> <p>Cleaning a gas cooktop is a bit more involved than cleaning a glass cooktop, but it is still not too complex. Start by ensuring the surface is completely cool and that all of the burners are off. Then, remove the grates, the caps covering the burners, and each of the burners. Put the grates in the sink and spray them with a degreaser. Leave the degreaser soaking on the grates while you continue cleaning the rest of the cooktop.</p> <p>Spray the cooktop with the degreaser and let it sit for a few minutes before using a soft scouring pad to scrub off grease and grime. Use a nylon scrub brush to tackle baked-on messes. Then, wipe off the grime and degreaser and rinse the stove with water. Dry the stove and consider doing one final wipe down with a Magic Eraser to remove any residue that remains.</p> <p>Clean the grates and burner caps using a nylon brush. Clean the burners with hot water and scrub gently with the nylon brush; avoid using any harsh cleaners on the burners. Finally, reassemble the cooktop.</p>",479

425,wine stopper,"<p>For more information about wine stoppers, consider these answers to some of the most common queries. For other questions, contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q. How long is wine good with a wine stopper?</h3> <p>How long a wine remains good depends on the type of wine stopper. Non-vacuum stoppers do not remove air from the bottle, so there is still air leaking into the bottle when the stopper is in place.</p> <p>Materials also make a difference. If the goal is to keep a bottle good for only a day or two and aesthetics is the goal, then glass will work. Other cork-replacement stoppers, like stainless steel, plastic, rubber, silicone, and cork, might save the wine for two to three days.</p> <p>A well-designed champagne stopper can keep champagne or wine good for three to five days, while a vacuum stopper can preserve your wine for up to 10 days.</p> <h3>Q. Can a wine stopper be used for champagne? </h3> <p>If the stopper has a locking feature, then it can be used on a champagne or sparkling wine bottle. But without the lock, the fizz pressure can cause the stopper to pop off, allowing air in and spoiling the bubbly. Better to use a champagne stopper for champagne or sparkling wine.</p> <h3>Q. How long do wine stoppers last?</h3> <p>Wine stoppers can last for years if you take care of them. Yes, some can be placed in the dishwasher, but they might last longer if they’re hand-washed. Some rubber may tear easily and some materials may rust; stoppers made with these materials will not last as long.</p> <h3>Q. What is the advantage of owning a wine stopper?</h3> <p>If a bottle of wine isn’t empty after one sitting and it’s tough to wrestle the cork back in the bottle in order to preserve the wine, a wine stopper is a great solution for saving wine for another day.</p>",312

432,fillet knife,"<p>Still have some questions about how to choose the best fillet knife? Take a look at some of the most commonly asked questions about this type of cutlery.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a boning knife and a fillet knife?</h3> <p>Boning knives are designed specifically for removing bones from meat, while fillet knives are designed to move along the contours of bones to remove flesh from smaller pieces of meat. The two are very similar, with some knives capable of performing both tasks.</p> <h3>Q. What size fillet knife do I need?</h3> <p>It depends on what you’re filleting. A 7-inch blade is suitable for filleting small fish, such as trout and bass, while a 9-inch blade is a better choice for filleting large fish, such as salmon.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a fillet knife on fish?</h3> <p>After gutting, cleaning, and beheading the fish, run the fillet knife down the fish’s spine from the tail to the head, using the backbone as a guide. Use a slicing motion versus a sawing motion to create a smooth, even cut.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use an electric fillet knife?</h3> <p>When using an electric fillet knife, keep the fish’s head intact. Starting just below the head, cut from head to tail using the spin as a guide. Keep one hand on the head to hold the fish steady while cutting.</p> <h3>Q. How often do you need to sharpen a fillet knife?</h3> <p>A carbon steel knife should be sharpened before each use, whereas you should sharpen a stainless steel knife every two to four uses.</p>",261
433,electric fillet knife,"<p>If you’re still wondering about how a fillet knife differs from other cutlery or which size is best for filleting fish, then read on for answers to some of the most common questions about these electric knives.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a fillet knife and a boning knife?</h3> <p>Though they look very similar, these two types of knives serve different purposes. Fillet knives have thinner blades, are curved, and are much more flexible than boning knives. This shape flexibility allows them to cut around delicate and irregularly shaped bones of fish. Boning knives are stiffer and less pliable, allowing them to separate meat from bone on pork and beef.</p> <h3>Q. What size fish fillet knife is best?</h3> <p>The best size for a fish filet knife is 7.5 inches. That provides enough length to handle larger trout and salmon while being small enough for maneuvering around the delicate bone structure of smaller crappie and panfish.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a fillet knife?</h3> <p>When deciding which fillet knife to buy, consider how you will be using the knife. If you plan on filleting primarily from the boat or dock, consider purchasing a cordless fillet knife or one that can operate from a cigarette lighter or 12-volt battery. Also, consider the size fish you plan to fillet. For smaller freshwater fish, go with a 7- or 8-inch knife. For larger saltwater fish, consider a 9-inch knife. If you fish a wide range of fish species, consider a kit that includes long and short blades.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen an electric fillet knife?</h3> <p>The best way to sharpen an electric fillet knife is to use a block knife sharpener. Begin by unplugging the electric knife and removing the blades. Separate the blades and sharpen each blade individually by running the edge along the “V” in the block sharpener. If there are two stages to the sharpener, begin with the coarsest slot and end with the finishing slot. Sharpening stones can also hone fine edges on dull blades.</p>",337

438,cold press juicer,"<p>For more information about cold press juicers, check out these answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. If additional concerns arise, contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q. Is a masticating juicer the same as cold press?</h3> <p>Yes. A masticating juicer uses an auger to slowly extract juice without heating the fruits and vegetables, which can negatively affect the nutrient content of the juice. It’s this lack of heat that also gives it the name “cold press juicer.”</p> <p>On the other hand, a centrifugal juicer uses high speeds and spinning blades to produce juice in just seconds. The spinning blades heat up, which can affect the nutrients in the juice. A citrus juicer is either manual or electric, but they both generally work in the same manner. Place a halved fruit over the cone and press down on the juicer, relying on the motor or leverage and gravity to do the rest.</p> <h3>Q. Which is better, centrifugal or masticating?</h3> <p>Consider your needs and preferences to decide which type of juicer is better for you. Centrifugal juicers are typically less expensive, take only seconds to make juice, and require less prep time because you can use whole pieces of fruits and vegetables. Masticating juicers provide a higher yield of liquid through the “chewing” process. Because the auger works slowly and doesn’t generate any heat, no nutrients are lost. Because there is little oxidation, the juice lasts longer.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between cold pressed juice and regular juice?</h3> <p>Regular juice has added preservatives (so it lasts longer) and added sugar. Cold pressed juice is simply fresh fruits and vegetables with no additives.</p> <h3>Q. What is the benefit of cold pressed juice?</h3> <p>Cold pressed juice is healthier because the process effectively preserves nutrients; plus, it contains no added sugar.</p> <h3>Q. How long does cold pressed juice last?</h3> <p>Most cold pressed juice can last up to 72 hours in the refrigerator.</p> <h3>Q. Can I freeze cold pressed juice?</h3> <p>Yes. When properly frozen, cold pressed juice can last up to six months.</p>",338

An extra-large air fryer has a capacity of 8 or more quarts.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use an air fryer?</h3> <p>To use an air fryer, first, apply a light coat of oil to the food you wish to fry. Next, set the desired temperature and preheat if needed, then place the food in the air fryer basket, shake every 5 to 10 minutes, and cook as long as required.</p> <h3>Q: How do you preheat an air fryer?</h3> <p>To preheat an air fryer, simply turn it on, and set it to the desired temperature.

444,mini freezer,"<p>Do you have additional questions about mini freezers in the quest to decide on the ideal option? Read through some of the most frequently asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a mini freezer as a mini fridge?</h3> <p>Some mini freezers may offer temperature settings that allow them to also function as a fridge. Alternatively, you may also be able to convert a mini freezer into a mini fridge by replacing the freezer’s thermostat with a refrigerator thermostat.</p> <h3>Q: Are mini freezers quiet?</h3> <p>Some mini freezers are louder than others. Check the manufacturer’s product description to determine the decibel rating for each model. Under 40 decibels is considered quiet for a freezer, but some particularly quiet models are as low as 30 decibels. In general, energy-efficient models make less noise since the compressor isn’t working as hard.</p> <h3>Q: What size mini freezer should I get?</h3> <p>Your specific needs and available space help to determine the optimal freezer size. Consider where you’ll be placing the freezer and the amount of food you plan to store in it. Also, decide if it will be your only freezer or will simply offer supplemental storage space for another freezer in the home.</p> <h3>Q: How long do mini freezers last?</h3> <p>The average lifespan of a mini freezer is around 11 years.

445,pizza peel,"<p>The best pizza peel makes it easier to cook pizza. However, it might take some time to master the art of pizza making. Below are answers to a few of the most frequently asked questions about pizza peels to help you get started.</p> <h3>Q. How thick should a pizza peel be?</h3> <p>Metal pizza peels are typically 1 to 3 millimeters—or about 3/64 to 1/8 inches—thick. Wood peels are thicker, usually between 1/2 and 3/4 inches.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best wood for a pizza peel?</h3> <p>Hardy woods like mahogany, acacia, and cherry are all optimal woods for a pizza peel.</p> <h3>Q. Why does my pizza stick to the peel?</h3> <p>Smooth surfaces create suction between the moist dough and the peel. Airflow between the pizza and the peel prevents this type of sticking. Rougher and perforated surfaces help create this type of airflow. You can also apply flour or cornmeal to the surface of a pizza peel to reduce sticking.</p>",159
446,carving knife,"<p>Now that you know more about carving knives, you may have lingering questions. If you’re still wondering about some carving knife features, then read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about this cutlery.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a carving and a slicing knife?</h3> <p>A carving knife has a long narrow blade that tapers to a point from handle to tip, while a slicing knife features a long straight blade that maintains its width throughout the length of the blade and has a rounded tip. Carving knives are more adept at cutting turkey, chicken, and other meats with bones, while slicing knives are better suited for carving boneless meats such as brisket and ham.</p> <h3>Q. How long should a carving knife be?</h3> <p>A manual carving knife should be at least 8 inches long to cut through chickens and beef tenderloins. Longer carving knives of 10 inches or more are suitable for large turkeys and brisket. Most electric carving knives have blades between 7 and 9 inches long. Their power blades allow them to cut through even larger 10- to 12-pound turkeys with relative ease.</p> <h3>Q. Should a carving knife be serrated?</h3> <p>A carving knife usually has a smooth blade. A serrated edge is not ideal as the blade may tear or shred meat instead of making a clean slice. With this in mind, while a serrated electric knife may allow the user to carve a turkey more quickly than a standard carving knife, it will not produce the same clean cut.</p>",257
447,cake pan,"<p>If you want more info about selecting and using the best cake pan, consider the answers to these common questions.</p> <h3>Q. What cake pans do professionals use?</h3> <p>While professional bakers may have different preferences, most pro pastry chefs prefer aluminized steel cake pans, as this material is durable and offers even heat distribution for consistent results.</p> <h3>Q. Can you bake a cake without a cake pan?</h3> <p>Yes, if you don’t own a cake pan, you can use a casserole dish or an oven-safe glass mixing bowl; you can even make a mug cake in the microwave. In a pinch, you can also try to create a cake pan out of heavy-duty aluminum foil. If you have a bread maker, you can use it to bake a cake as well.</p> <h3>Q. How deep should cake pans be?</h3> <p>Cake pans should be between 2 and 3 inches deep.</p> <h3>Q. How do you grease a cake pan?</h3> <p>All cake pans, even nonstick cake pans, should be greased before baking a cake. If a pan isn’t properly greased, cakes may stick to the sides or base, resulting in broken cakes unsuitable for decorating. There are a few different ways to grease a cake pan. You can use a baking spray or spread oil, vegetable shortening, or butter in a thin layer over the pan and then sprinkle flour over the surface. You can also make a special paste using equal parts flour, shortening, and vegetable oil. Use a pastry brush to spread the paste over the entire interior of the pan.</p> <h3>Q. How do you remove cake from a cake pan?</h3> <p>Before removing a cake from the pan, let it cool for the amount of time indicated by the recipe. Removing it when it is too hot could cause it to crack, and removing when it has cooled completely could cause it to stick to the pan. Once the cake has cooled for the recommended time, run a releasing tool or a dull knife around the edges of the pan to loosen it. Put a wire cooling rack on top of the cake pan. Use both hands to pick up the pan with the wire rack, and flip them both over to release the cake onto the rack. Place the rack down, and slowly lift the cake pan up straight.</p>",386

What is the best way to cut a brisket?</h3> <p>A brisket has two parts: the flat, which is the thinner, single layer of muscle, and the point, which is the fatter, double layer. The best way to cut brisket is to first slice the flat section with the grain and then slice the point against the grain.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a slicing, carving, and trimming knife?</h3> <p>Generally, slicing and carving knives often look similar, but slicing knives are for bread while carving knives have smaller teeth or flat edges for cutting meat. Trimming knives are small, and they’re generally used for trimming fat.</p>",159
449,knife oil,"<p>It’s natural to have a few questions if you’ve never used knife oil before. Remember that it will take some practice to learn the best way to apply and use the oil. You may also find some oils that work better on your knives than others.</p> <h3>Q. What is food-grade knife oil?</h3> <p>Food-grade knife oil is made of ingredients that are safe for human and animal consumption. They often work on knife blades, cutting boards, and other surfaces that will eventually come into contact with food. However, they’re not meant for direct application to food. Do not confuse these oils with cooking oils.</p> <h3>Q. How should I use a knife lubricant?</h3> <p>Knife lubricants keep moving parts in working order. It may only take a drop or two or a small spray near the joint of a folding knife to apply the lubricant. Work the oil in by moving the joint back and forth several times. Rub excess oil into the blade using a microfiber cloth.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of oil is best for a pocket knife?</h3> <p>Pocket knives typically require a conditioning/lubricating oil to maintain the joint. Some may also require periodic oiling to protect the blade from rust. A honing oil can also be helpful when sharpening. Luckily, some knife oils can do all three, like all-purpose mineral oil.</p> <h3>Q. What oil should I use on wooden knife handles?</h3> <p>Use a knife oil that conditions cutting boards and other wood surfaces as well as knife blades.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I oil my knives?</h3> <p>That depends on the type of knife and how often it gets used. Carbon steel knives require oiling after each use. A frequently used pocket knife may require weekly lubrication. Stainless steel kitchen knives may do well with a weekly or a bi-weekly oiling schedule.</p>",300
450,grill mats,"<p>If you still have unanswered questions about grill mats, read on for more information about these versatile grilling tools.</p> <h3>Q. Are grill mats healthy to use?</h3> <p>Grill mats are completely safe when they’re used with barbecue gloves, plastic or rubber grilling utensils, and when the grill is at the appropriate temperature. Similar to Teflon frying pans, the protective materials used in grill mats won’t break down unless the mat is exposed to temperatures that exceed 500 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <h3>Q. What size grill mat do I need?</h3> <p>Measure the width and depth of the grill and choose a grill mat size that will leave a perimeter of 2 to 3 inches per side between the edge of the grill mat and the sides of the grill.</p> <h3>Q. When should I place the grill mat on my grill?</h3> <p>It depends on the type of grill. Gas grills heat up slowly and evenly, so a grill mat can be placed on the grill when it is lit.</p> <p>However, charcoal and wood-burning grills often produce high-temperature fluctuations that are initially difficult to control. For this reason, it’s better to place the grill mat on the grill after the coals have reached an ember.</p>",199

Silicone, safe to use for temperatures up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, is approved as a food-safe material by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p> <h3>Q. How do you fill a donut pan?</h3> <p>For best results, fill each well of a donut pan almost all the way to the top with batter. Leave a bit of room so the donuts don’t overflow the wells when the batter rises during baking. Using a piping bag can help reduce mess and ensure the batter makes it into the wells and not on other parts of the pan.</p> <h3>Q. Should you grease silicone donut pans?</h3> <p>Some silicone donut pans must be greased prior to baking; consult the care instructions from the manufacturer for your specific pan.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep donuts from sticking to the pan?</h3> <p>Since each donut pan is different, consult with the manufacturer’s use and care instructions if your donuts stick to the pan. Some pans may have specific cleaning instructions to preserve the nonstick surface.</p>",216

Have the cleaver professionally sharpened or use an at-home sharpener.

A decanter with a glass topper that does not have an airtight seal will slowly evaporate but can still be stored for several months without issue.</p> <h3>Q. Can I keep my whiskey in a crystal decanter?</h3> <p>It may be safe to use a crystal decanter for serving beverages, but do not use a crystal decanter to store whiskey because lead will eventually leach from the glass into the alcohol, making it unsafe for ingestion.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use the same decanter for whiskey, bourbon, and scotch?</h3> <p>You can store whiskey, bourbon, or scotch in a decanter without affecting the flavor of the spirits. The type of glass you use to serve the alcohol is much more important than the decanter used to store it.</p> <h3>Q. What are whiskey stones?</h3> <p>Whiskey stones are small rocks or cubes of stainless steel that you can cool in the freezer and use instead of ice. While ice will melt and water down the drink, whiskey stones will not dissolve, simply cooling the beverage instead.</p>",227

The hot steam should loosen the stuck-on food and allow you to wipe it up more easily with a soapy cloth and warm water. After cleaning the interior, wipe it with a wet towel and then thoroughly dry.</p> <h3>Q.

What are different shaped glasses for?</h3> <p>The shape of the glass largely has to do with creating and maintaining a particular aroma and temperature. Glasses with larger openings at the top, such as a martini glass, create a broad surface for the nose to take in aromas while drinking. This is especially important for martinis, which have different ingredients and garnishes that add distinct aromas and impact the taste.</p> <p>Glasses with smaller openings are typically for sweeter drinks that don’t require aroma to add flavor. The smaller mouth also better preserves temperature than those with wider mouths. Glasses with stems give the user a means of holding a drink without warming the liquid with the hand.</p> <h3>Q. What drinks can be served in a martini glass?</h3> <p>In addition to martinis, a wide variety of different drink types can be served in a martini glass, including Manhattans, negronis, cosmopolitans, gimlets, and grasshoppers.</p> <h3>Q.

More basic drinks that don’t include a nonalcoholic mixer and use a limited amount of ice are best suited for smaller rocks glasses with a 6- to 8-ounce capacity.</p> <h3>Q. What style of glassware is whiskey served in?</h3> <p>This depends on how the whiskey is being served. Whiskey on the rocks should be served in a rocks glass. Whiskey straight up is typically high-quality whiskey and should therefore be served in a tasting glass, such as a Glencairn glass, which maximizes aroma.</p> <h3>Q. How is a cocktail glass chilled?</h3> <p>To quickly chill a cocktail glass, fill the glass with crushed ice and soda water. The carbonation of the soda water coupled with the ice causes the glass to freeze faster.</p>",354

How do you blend ice smoothly?</h3> <p>Let the ice sit for a couple of minutes before filling up the blender about a third of the way, leaving enough space for the cubes to bounce around.

494,rotomolded cooler,"<p>If you’re still wondering what a rotomolded cooler is or how long food will keep in a cooler, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. What is a rotomolded cooler? </h3> <p>The term “rotomolded” describes how the cooler is made. It refers to rotational molding, which is a process of taking hot molten plastic and rotating it at a certain speed to attain a consistent thickness throughout the body of the cooler. Rotomolding ensures that there are no weak spots in the body of the cooler that could result in cracking or shattering.</p> <h3>Q. How long does food stay cold in a cooler? </h3> <p>This depends on the cooler. The best rotomolded coolers feature insulation-filled walls 3 inches thick that can keep food cold for up to 10 days depending on external temperatures and how often the cooler is opened.</p> <h3>Q. How do you pack your cooler correctly?</h3> <p>Before packing the cooler, precool it by filling it with ice the day before the trip. Load the cooler with frozen food and chilled drinks as opposed to chilled food and room-temperature drinks for best results. If possible, load the cooler with a 2:1 ratio of ice to drinks/food. The more ice you can pack in, the better. Pack the cooler tightly, eliminating air gaps that can create warm pockets that cause ice to melt more quickly.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to clean my rotomolded cooler?</h3> <p>Yes, but use mild cleaners to avoid damaging or staining the cooler. Clean the cooler out with a solution of mild dish soap and water. For deodorizing a cooler, use a solution of bleach and water.</p> <h3>Q. How long can my rotomolded cooler last?</h3> <p>If properly cared for, a rotomolded cooler will last many years. The insulation inside the cooler will continue to provide the same amount of insulation as long as the shell does not crack. To extend the lifetime of the shell, limit the amount of direct sun exposure the cooler receives and clean it periodically between uses.</p>",338

What is the most common springform pan size?</h3> <p>The most common springform pan size is the 9-inch pan, but if there’s uncertainty about which size will be the most useful, shoppers can opt to buy a set.</p> <h3>Q. What is the ideal springform pan size for baking a cheesecake?</h3> <p>A 9-inch pan is most common for baking cheesecakes, but 8- and 10-inch pans are used as well. A 4.5-inch pan is commonly used to bake mini cheesecakes.</p> <h3>Q. Do springform pans leak?</h3> <p>Although the springform pan design has come a long way, the pans can still leak, especially when cooking with a runny batter like cake batter. To help prevent leaks, wrap the base in aluminum foil before putting it in the oven.</p> <h3>Q. What are the most important considerations when choosing a springform pan?</h3> <p>Size is the most important consideration when choosing a springform pan, so check the recipes that will be used with the pan for size recommendations.

What should I put in the dishwasher to clean it?</h3> <p>Clean a dishwasher by placing a small cup of white vinegar into the dishwasher and running it on a high-heat cycle; the vinegar will cut through oil and grime, so you only need to wipe the interior dry when the cycle is complete.</p> <h3>Q. When should I replace a dishwasher?</h3> <p>It’s advised to replace the dishwasher when it regularly stops in the middle of a cycle or if it has problems starting. Another sign that it’s time to upgrade is if the dishwasher no longer cleans the dishes the way that it did originally. This will typically begin to happen after 5 to 10 years of use.</p> <h3>Q. How many gallons of water does a dishwasher use?</h3> <p>On average, a dishwasher will use between 2 and 5 gallons of water per cycle, though this depends on the size of the dishwasher and the wash cycle that’s selected.</p> <h3>Q. How do I pull out my dishwasher?</h3> <p>Countertop and portable dishwashers can typically be pulled out without any extra steps, but a standard dishwasher is often secured to the underside of a countertop, so you would need to remove these screws before the dishwasher can be slowly pulled away from the wall. Keep in mind that the drain line and electrical connection should remain attached when the dishwasher is being pulled out.</p>",283

The latter offers the opportunity to create something unique and special, but it can take considerable time and effort.</p> <h3>Q: How long does epoxy last?</h3> <p>In its unmixed state, epoxy has a shelf life of around 2 to 3 years, but check the manufacturer’s information for specifics.</p> <p>How long epoxy countertops last depends on the wear and tear they receive, although they’re durable. Refinished laminate countertops may need attention after around 5 years. Solid countertops could last much longer, and if the surface eventually starts to dull, a light wipe with mineral oil will usually revitalizes them.</p>",247

It feels as smooth to the touch as glass but is much lighter.</p> <h3>Q. How do I wash my plastic drinking glasses?</h3> <p>Check the manufacturer’s recommendations for washing your plastic drinking glasses. Some are dishwasher safe in upper and lower racks.

513,smokeless indoor grills,"<p>If you’re wondering just how smokeless an indoor grill is or if you can take a smokeless indoor grill outdoors, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions about these handy appliances.</p> <h3>Q. Are smokeless indoor grills completely smokeless?</h3> <p>While smokeless indoor grills will produce far less smoke than a charcoal or even gas grill, they will produce some exhaust fumes. Just as cooking at high temperatures on a range with a frying pan will produce smoke, so too will an indoor grill. Indoor grills will produce the most smoke when they are being used to sear meat.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a smokeless indoor grill outdoors?</h3> <p>Yes. It is safe to use a smokeless indoor grill outdoors but only in dry weather. Since indoor grills use electricity for power, they can short out or even create an electrocution hazard if exposed to water. Use your electric smokeless grill outside in good weather, then bring it back inside immediately afterward to store.</p> <h3>Q. Can smokeless indoor grills get hot enough to grill burgers?</h3> <p>Yes. In fact, some smokeless indoor grills can reach a temperature of up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which is plenty of heat to grill a burger.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean my smokeless indoor grill?</h3> <p>Luckily, smokeless indoor grills are much easier to clean than an outdoor gas or charcoal grill. Wait for the grill to cool, then remove the grill plates. Clean the grill plates by hand in the sink. Empty the grease tray in a trash can, then rinse and clean it in the sink as well. With the plates removed, wipe out the interior and exterior of the grill with a damp cloth or sponge. Many of the grill plates and drip trays are dishwasher-safe, but you should read the directions to find out before you put them into a dishwasher. Nonstick surfaces on grill plates also last longer when you hand-wash them.</p> <h3>Q. How many hours can I keep my smokeless indoor grill on?</h3> <p>There are no limitations for how long you can keep a smokeless indoor grill on; however, it’s not a good idea to heat the grill for long periods with no food on it. Doing so can damage the grates or the griddle.</p>",377

526,steak knives,"<p>Whether for special events or a weekly steak dinner, it’s worth it to have a set of steak knives in the kitchen. These quality utensils are designed to cut easily through a juicy steak—no sawing or tearing—and look attractive at the table. Still deciding on the right steak knives or how to care for them? Read on for some frequently asked questions and answers on choosing and maintaining steak knives.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of knife is best for steak?</h3> <p>Many experts prefer a straight-edge steak knife, which creates cleaner cuts. Other features to look for include an upswept blade, well-balanced construction, and comfortable handle. An upswept blade makes it easier to use the entire length of the blade to cut, while a well-balanced design and nice handle add to comfort.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a steak knife and a dinner knife?</h3> <p>Designed for cutting through meat, a steak knife is sturdier and sharper than a dinner knife.</p> <h3>Q. Do I have to hand-wash steak knives?</h3> <p>Dishwasher-safe steak knives are available. However, the hot environment, soap, and rough cycle of a dishwasher is hard on knives, so it’s best to hand-wash steak knives, even if they’re dishwasher-safe.</p> <h3>Q. Do steak knives get dull?</h3> <p>Yes, steak knives can get dull over time. Steak knives can benefit from occasional sharpening when their performance starts to diminish. Some users may also choose to run straight-edge knives over a honing steel before each use to maintain the sharp edge.</p> <h3>Q. How long should a steak knife be?</h3> <p>Most steak knives measure around 8 to 9 inches in length.</p> <h3>Q. How thick should a steak knife be?</h3> <p>Blade thickness is not an important feature to consider when shopping for a steak knife; a knife set from a reputable manufacturer will be an appropriate thickness for cutting through steak.</p> <h3>Q. What are forged blades?</h3> <p>Forged blades are made from a single piece of steel, pounded into the blade shape, while stamped blades are cut out of flat sheets of steel and then honed. In the past, forged knives were considered much better than stamped knives. However, with high-quality stamped knives now available (as well as subpar forged knives), the gap between the two is closing.</p>",370
527,loppers,"<p>A quality pair of loppers is an arborist’s or home landscaper’s best friend, but dozens of sets are available, and users want to know whether they’re getting a good deal for the price. A few questions are to be expected for those looking to invest in a set (or two) of loppers.</p> <h3>Q. What do you use loppers for?</h3> <p>Loppers serve multiple landscaping purposes, from pruning shrubs to cutting the limbs of dead trees. Loppers are like pruning shears with extended handles, and both gardening tools require manual operation.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a lopper and a pruner?</h3> <p>Loppers require two hands to operate and are designed to cut midsize stems and branches. Pruners are smaller and more closely resemble scissors. Pruning shears require only one hand to operate and are intended for cutting smaller stems and branches.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for when buying a lopper?</h3> <p>The most suitable loppers for the user depend on intended use, budget, arm strength, and preferences related to material and comfort.</p> <ul><li>Bypass vs. anvil blades: Bypass loppers are suitable for cutting living plants, like green tree branches and shrubbery, while anvil blades are better at handling dry, brittle branches.</li><li>Cutting action: Basic manual models work best on narrow branches; ratcheting cutters are more effective for thicker stems; and compound action loppers are intended for use on cutting thicker branches. These tools often possess the most cutting power.</li><li>Blade material: Stainless steel resists rust and stains, generally requiring less maintenance compared to carbon steel. Blades containing carbon steel do not have these characteristics unless they’re treated with a protective coating. Carbon steel is more rigid, less expensive, and more easily sharpened.</li><li>Length: Naturally, longer loppers (33 inches or more) are best for reaching to cut higher branches and shrub leaves. Models with a telescoping handle are versatile and some provide significant length adjustment.</li><li>Ergonomics: Cutters with padded grips made of rubber or foam are more comfortable to use. If arm fatigue and wrist pain are concerns for you, go with loppers that weigh less than 3 pounds and have shock-absorbing handles.</li></ul> <h3>Q. Are bypass loppers better than anvil loppers?</h3> <p>This depends on the types of branches and stems you plan on cutting. Bypass loppers are more suitable for sharp cuts through soft, living plants like overgrown shrubs. These blades may dull when used on hard, dead branches. Anvil loppers are more suitable for this type of task, while they tend to crush and tear softer greenery.</p> <h3>Q. How thick of a branch can loppers cut?</h3> <p>A heavy-duty anvil lopper is capable of cutting dead branches up to about 3 inches thick. Some large-head loppers, such as the Corona Super-Duty Loppers, can cut green branches up to 3 inches thick.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best telescopic tree pruner?</h3> <p>The Kings County Tools Double Ratcheting Anvil Lopper is among the most versatile tree pruners, capable of adjusting between 26 and 40 inches in length. The Spear &amp; Jackson Telescopic Ratchet Lopper is one of the best tools for dealing with thicker dead branches with an adjustable length between 18 inches and 30 inches. For telescoping action in a bypass lopper, consider the Wolf-Garten Telescoping Bypass Lopper.</p> <h3>Q. How do you maintain a lopper?</h3> <p>Loppers with carbon steel blades generally require more upkeep. Unlike stainless steel, this material is susceptible to rust and stains. Wipe carbon steel blades clean after each use. Additionally, components of the cutting mechanism should be lubricated to maintain smooth cutting performance.</p>",578
528,pole saw,"<p>Pole saws are dangerous tools that should be used only by those who are confident about how to operate the tool and who have taken proper safety precautions, like wearing personal protective equipment. To learn more about how this tool can be used, take a look at these answers to commonly asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a pole saw as a chainsaw?</h3> <p>A pole saw is intended to cut difficult-to-reach branches in order to trim trees, hedges, and other foliage. While the saw does effectively cut through wood, it’s not large enough to fully replace a chainsaw. A chainsaw has the power and size to be able to cut through the trunk of a tree, while a pole saw is best used for tree trimming.</p> <h3>Q. Can you trim hedges with a pole saw?</h3> <p>These versatile tools can be used in place of a hedge trimmer to maintain hedges, vines, and brambles, if necessary.</p> <h3>Q. How big a limb can I cut with a pole saw?</h3> <p>Depending on the size of the saw and the power potential of the tool, pole saws can be used to cut branches from 2 to 9 inches in size. Just keep in mind that the best electric pole saw will likely have less power output than the best gas pole saw, so if the tool will be used regularly for very thick branches, then a gas pole saw would be better.</p> <h3>Q. Can a pole saw get wet?</h3> <p>While most pole saws have some resistance to water, it isn’t a good idea to get the pole saw wet because the water can damage the electric components of the tool or cause rusting and corrosion on the saw. However, it should be noted that there is no harm in using a pole saw to cut through wet wood—just make sure to properly clean the saw after use so that moisture doesn’t cling to the metal and cause rusting.</p> <h3>Q. Is it safe to use a pole saw on a ladder?</h3> <p>Even the best pole saws aren’t safe to use on a ladder. The saw is situated at the end of a long, telescoping pole that may be able to reach up to 12 feet away without the need for a ladder. Electric pole saws also have power cords that can cause users to trip, but even with a cordless pole saw it’s too difficult for the user to safely keep themselves balanced while operating this power tool on a ladder.</p>",417
529,stump grinders,"<p>If you’re wondering why stump grinders cost so much or just how deep into the earth you need to grind that stump, read on for answers to these and other questions about this heavy machinery.</p> <h3>Q. How far down do you grind a stump?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, you should grind a stump down 4 to 6 inches below ground level. This depth is deep enough to remove the stump from view while allowing for fill to be applied on top of it and, if desired, grass to grow.</p> <h3>Q. Why are stump grinders so expensive?</h3> <p>Stump grinders are heavy machinery that require large blades and powerful engines to drive that blade. Larger engines and the hard metals required for stump grinder blades drive the price of the grinder up.</p> <h3>Q. Does stump grinding attract termites?</h3> <p>Not really. While stump grinding does create material termites like to feed on, grinding the stump doesn’t release any scents or create an environment that would necessarily attract termites.</p> <h3>Q. What can I do with shavings from stump grinding?</h3> <p>The best use for stump shavings is as mulch in surrounding landscaping. Stump shavings, like the mulch you buy at the store, help soil retain moisture while serving as an excellent weed barrier.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a stump grinder in the rain?</h3> <p>You can use a stump grinder in the rain—just keep in mind that the weight of the grinder can make it difficult to push in soft soil. The grinder can become stuck or may sink into the ground if it’s too wet.</p>",258
530,reel mower,"<p>With no toxic fumes, no need to store fuel or charge batteries, and quiet operation, the reel mower is making a comeback. This eco-friendly mower will reduce your carbon footprint while offering some physical exercise. For those thinking of investing in a reel mower, a few questions are to be expected.</p> <h3>Q. Is it hard to push a reel mower?</h3> <p>Manual reel mowers are easy to push in thin sparse grass, but it takes more force to move one through tall, dense, or coarse grass.</p> <h3>Q. Can you mow wet grass with a reel mower?</h3> <p>Although a manual reel mower can easily cut through wet grass, doing so frequently is not advisable. As with other mowers, clippings will clump and look unsightly. Wet clippings that stick to the mower increase rust formation, dulling the blades prematurely.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you mow with a reel mower?</h3> <p>Mow as often as is necessary to keep from removing more than one-third of the grass’s blade. This may mean mowing two or more times in a week during the fast-growing grass season.</p> <h3>Q. When should I sharpen my reel mower?</h3> <p>In general, it’s a good idea to sharpen the blades on a reel mower after 20 to 25 hours of use. For some users, this may be once a year; others may need to sharpen blades two or more times in a season.</p>",230

If you can’t find what you want here, reach out to the machine’s manufacturer and speak to a customer service representative.</p> <h3>Q: How does a lawn sweeper work?</h3> <p>Lawn sweepers use a transmission driven by one of the wheels to turn cylindrical brushes. These brushes grab debris and propel them down a chute and into a hopper.</p> <h3>Q: How do you empty a lawn sweeper?</h3> <p>Most lawn sweepers have dump functions. The hoppers empty by either lifting a handle or pulling an attached rope. The hopper will open up and release its contents onto the ground.</p> <h3>Q: Do lawn sweepers work on grass clippings?</h3> <p>Lawn sweepers work very well on grass clippings, but some models perform better than others.</p> <h3>Q: Do lawn sweepers work on a wet lawn?</h3> <p>Wet lawns are a challenge for lawn sweepers.

535,weed eater string,"<p>Now that you have more information about weed eater string and some of the top product picks, it should be easier to make a choice. Before you do, here are a few answers to some of the most frequently asked questions that will help you get you up and running with your new weed wacker string.</p> <h3>Q: What is the thickest weed eater line?</h3> <p>Trimmer line ranges in size from about .065-inch to .170-inch. Large diameter line requires a properly sized trimmer head and more power to operate. Be sure to check the weed wacker’s operator’s manual for compatibility before attempting to load a new size.</p> <h3>Q: Is square trimmer line better than round?</h3> <p>Square trimmer line has four hard cutting edges that are designed to aggressively cut through coarse weeds and green underbrush, where it excels. Round line is quieter and more fuel-efficient due to reduced wind resistance. It is also more durable than square line of the same size because it consists of more material. For generally weed-free lawns, round line could be the best choice.</p> <h3>Q: How do I install a new weed eater string?</h3> <p>Some string trimmers require pre-cut lengths of line. Others use either one or two long lengths of line that wind onto a spool. You may need to remove the spool from the housing or load it in place. Refer to the owner’s manual or manufacturer’s website for detailed instructions for your specific trimmer brand and model.</p> <h3>Q: Which way should I wind the weed eater string?</h3> <p>Wind the string in the opposite direction of its rotation. In most cases, you’ll want to wind the string counterclockwise. Many trimmer manufacturers imprint an arrow on the spool to show the proper direction to wind the string.</p> <h3>Q: How often do I have to replace the weed eater string?</h3> <p>As long as it is feeding properly and in good working order, you only need to replace the string when it runs out. Old string or string that has been exposed to the elements for an extended period can become brittle and may need to be replaced.</p>",351
536,mole repellent,"<p>Take a look below at the answers to these common questions about mole repellents.</p> <h3>Q: What smell do moles hate?</h3> <p>Moles hate the smell of castor oil, which is why it is commonly used in natural mole repellents to keep your yard safe.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use mole repellent granules?</h3> <p>When using mole repellent granules it is important to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for use. Some products can simply be spread evenly across your lawn, while others require you to water them into the lawn after spreading.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use castor oil as a mole repellent?</h3> <p>To use 100% castor oil as a mole repellent, you must mix three parts castor oil with one part dish soap. You will need 4 tablespoons of this mixture to add to 1 gallon of water. Once the solution is mixed properly, it will need to be applied evenly to your yard with a spray bottle or sprayer.</p> <h3>Q: Should I get mole traps to use with a repellent?</h3> <p>You can get mole traps to use with repellents if you are comfortable relocating moles on your own. However, a repellent is designed to keep moles away from your yard, so a trap would likely be ineffective when used collaboratively. If you prefer to use traps, then it would be better to also use baits, instead of repellents.</p>",226
537,insect repellent,"<p>Do you have questions about insect repellents? Find the answers to some frequently asked bug spray questions.</p> <h3>Q. Does bug repellent actually work?</h3> <p>That depends on what you mean by work. Yes, they do keep bugs away, but most do not kill the insects, with the exception of repellents that contain insecticide. Repellents keep bugs from biting by interfering with receptors in the bug’s antennae. That makes it difficult to recognize people as food. Testing that shows a product reduces insect bites by 50 percent or more is the only way a manufacturer can tout it as an insect repellent.</p> <h3>Q. How should insect repellents be applied?</h3> <p>When applying insect repellents in the form of lotion or wipes, make sure that all areas of skin are covered with the product. Aerosol or spray bug repellents should be applied outdoors, so as not to inhale concentrated amounts. Apply the product in a slow, sweeping motion, then use your hands to evenly moisten exposed skin. Aerosols and sprays can also be used on most apparel for extra coverage, though products containing DEET are reactive to synthetic fabrics, and should not be applied to these materials.</p> <p>When applying insect repellent designed for clothing, such as those containing Permethrin, plan ahead. Choose a well-ventilated outdoor area, coat the garment or gear’s outer surface(s) until it is visibly moist, and allow it to dry before using the item.</p> <h3>Q. Are there any risks associated with insect repellents?</h3> <p>The primary risks associated with insect repellents include eye, oral, and skin irritation. In rare instances, allergic reactions may occur.</p>",262
538,sleeping bag,"<p>Every sleeping bag is different. Make sure to read the manufacturer’s instructions and guidelines so you know how to best use and maintain the sleeping bag. Proper storage also makes a difference in the longevity of your choice. Make sure it’s dry and clean before putting it away for the year.</p> <h3>Q: How do you wash a sleeping bag?</h3> <p>When you wash a sleeping bag, there are 2 options. You can either hand-wash in the bathtub or machine-wash on the gentle cycle in cold or warm water. Read the manufacturer’s instructions before hand- or machine-washing.</p> <h3>Q: Can sleeping bags be zipped together?</h3> <p>Some sleeping bag designs zip with a bag of the same model or models within the manufacturer’s other sleeping bag lines. However, this is not the case for all sleeping bags.</p> <h3>Q: Are sleeping bags safe for toddlers?</h3> <p>In general, sleeping bags aren’t safe for toddlers because toddlers don’t have sufficient body heat to keep themselves warm in an adult bag. Toddlers also move enough that they may not stay inside a child-size bag either.</p> <h3>Q: Is it warmer in a sleeping bag with fewer clothes?</h3> <p>No, clothing helps insulate the body. Protect the toes and fingers with extra layers because they get cold faster. Be careful around the torso, which produces the most heat. If the core gets overheated, the body begins to sweat, but the extremities might still be cold.</p>",234
539,tree swing,"<p>To get the most out of your new tree swing, consult these answers to frequently asked questions. Learn how to best install and maintain a tree swing for many years to come.</p> <h3>Q. Are tree swings safe?</h3> <p>If made of quality materials, installed properly, and used correctly, tree swings can be a safe way to have fun. The tree, seat, rope, or chain, and all connections should be checked at least once per season.</p> <h3>Q. How do you choose a tree for a swing?</h3> <p>Choose a strong tree species, like beech, oak, sycamore, or maple. Avoid weaker species such as pine, poplar, spruce, willow, and birch. The tree should be strong and sound, with no signs of disease, decay, or cracks.</p> <h3>Q. How high should a tree swing be off the ground?</h3> <p>Hang the swing so that the seat is 16 to 24 inches off the ground while unoccupied. When occupied, the seat should be at least 10 inches off the ground. The ideal branch height for a tree swing is between 10 and 15 feet.</p>",176
540,grass seed,"<p>If you’re still wondering what product is best for you, read on for answers to your most pressing grass-seed questions.</p> <h3>Q: What month is best for planting grass seed?</h3> <p>The best month for planting grass seed is September for cool-season grasses and May for warm-season grasses, although this can vary depending on where you live. For cool-season grasses, you want a combination of warm soil, moderate temperatures during the day, and cool temperatures at night. Warm-season grasses should be planted when temperatures eclipse 80 degrees during the day and remain warm through the night.</p> <h3>Q: How do you seed a lawn?</h3> <p>Once you’ve purchased your seed, you’ll need to prepare the soil. If reseeding, cut the grass to a height of 1.5 to 2 inches. Lightly rake the area to break up the soil’s surface, so it can receive the seeds. For new lawns, prepare the ground, making sure to even out the surface. Use a spreader to distribute the recommended amount of seed for reseeding or planting a new lawn.</p> <h3>Q: How do you prepare ground for grass seed?</h3> <p>If possible, use a soil test kit to determine the pH of your soil. Depending on the results, you might need to add organic matter such as lime, compost, topsoil, or peat moss to your soil. Once you’ve completed that step, break up the top ½-inch of the earth with a rake. The soil needs to be loose to accept the seeds.</p> <h3>Q: Can you mix grass seed with topsoil?</h3> <p>Mixing grass seed with topsoil is not a good idea. By combining the two, it’s difficult to spread the seeds evenly throughout the yard. It also might cause some seeds to be buried too deep into the soil to germinate and grow. For better results, spread the seed after mixing topsoil into the yard.</p> <h3>Q: Do you need to cover grass seed?</h3> <p>It’s best not to cover the grass seed with topsoil. Grass seeds are not strong enough to push through heavy earth after germinating. Covering the seeds with topsoil suffocates them, preventing them from growing.</p> <div><p></p><div><noscript></noscript></div><h3>DIY Lawn Care.

541,pop up canopy,"<p>As with every new purchase, it takes some time to learn the ins and outs of pop-up canopies. Here are a few common questions and answers to get you started.</p> <h3>Q. Is a slant-leg or straight-leg canopy better?</h3> <p>Straight-leg canopies are generally more durable and of higher quality. However, slant-leg canopies can perform better on uneven ground due to the angled legs.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a slant-leg canopy at the beach?</h3> <p>You can use a slant-leg canopy anywhere you can use a straight-leg canopy. They can work well on the beach as long as you have stakes or sandbags to anchor them to the ground in case of wind.</p> <h3>Q. How do you set up a pop-up canopy?</h3> <p>Setup varies from model to model, with some models popping up in a single step and others requiring two or three steps. Be sure to read through the instructions before beginning.</p> <p>The first step usually involves clearing the space in which the canopy will stand. Then you stand the frame upright and attach the cover to the frame. Pull the frame and cover outward, then lock each leg in place when it pulls taut. Adjust the legs to the desired height and secure the legs with stakes or weighted bags.</p> <h3>Q. How do you anchor a canopy so it doesn’t blow away?</h3> <p>Most canopies include stakes that drive through holes in the base of the legs to hold the canopy to the ground. Others may have tie-downs and additional stakes for added stability. You have to pull the fabric of the cover tight then press or hammer the stake into the ground to keep it secure. It helps to angle the stake toward the canopy so that the tension from the tie-down keeps the stake anchored. Other models include sandbags that attach to the legs and act as anchors.</p> <h3>Q. How much wind can a pop-up canopy take?</h3> <p>The durability and wind resistance varies from model to model. Most canopies, even lightweight models made of polyester or nylon, can withstand light 5 to 10-mile-an-hour winds without a problem. Heavier materials like polyethylene, polyurethane-coated canvas, and vinyl weigh more, which gives them extra wind resistance. However, unless you securely anchor them, they could still blow away.</p>",374
542,cornhole board,"<p>You may still have questions about playing cornhole. Read on to learn more about the equipment and how to play.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of wood is best for cornhole boards?</h3> <p>Plywood between 1/2 and 3/4-inch thick is best. It provides a stable landing surface that does not bounce when the bag lands on it.</p> <h3>Q: How do you play cornhole?</h3> <p>Cornhole is played either by two opposing players (singles), or two teams of two players each (doubles). Opposing players or teams stay in their lanes for the duration of the game. In singles, both players play from the same end at the same time. In doubles, opposing teams station a player at each end.</p> <p>Players begin at the headboard and alternate tossing bags at the footboard until both players have tossed all four of their bags. This is called an inning, and the score is taken at the end of each inning. Play continues until a winner or winning team is determined.</p> <p>Scoring is counted by cancellation, meaning that only one player/team scores per inning. Each bag that comes to rest on the surface of the board is worth 1 point. Each bag that is either thrown or knocked through the hole is worth 3 points. The first player or team to reach or exceed 21 points is the winner.</p> <h3>Q: How big is the hole on a cornhole board?</h3> <p>The hole is 6 inches in diameter. It is centered on the board, 9 inches from the top edge.</p>",249
543,outdoor projectors,"<p>Though many projectors are easy to use and set up, there are still some complications that may come up while using a new media tool. To get the most out of your new outdoor projector, consult these answers to some common questions about outdoor movie projectors.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a good outdoor projector for a movie?</h3> <p>Start by setting up the entire movie viewing space before buying the projector. Measure how far the screen will be from where you intend to set up the projector. Observe what the viewing area looks and sounds like, so you know how bright/dark and noisy/quiet the setting can be. Then, with a full idea of what the projector will need to do, you can better select the right outdoor projector for your situation.</p> <h3>Q. How many lumens do I need for an outdoor projector?</h3> <p>There are two main factors to help you decide: lighting and screen distance. If you are projecting at a distance farther than 16 feet, in more well-lit areas, or before the sun goes down, go with more lumens. As a general rule, 3,000 ANSI lumens should suffice.</p> <h3>Q. What outdoor projector resolution is right for me?</h3> <p>A resolution of 1080p is fine almost every time. However, if the screen is going to be bigger than 96 inches, 1080p may be stretched to its limits, and 4K resolution should be better. Still, if you want perfect-as-possible images with a smaller screen, jump straight to 4K.</p> <h3>Q. Are outdoor projectors waterproof?</h3> <p>Not really. While some outdoor portable projectors may be water-resistant, the lenses that produce the image should not get wet, nor should water get inside the device. Ideally, no outdoor projector should ever be left out in any moist weather, even a drizzle.</p> <h3>Q. Does it need to be completely dark outside to use a projector?</h3> <p>No, it doesn’t need to be completely dark outside to a projector. However, the darker it is, the higher quality the images will be.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a special screen for a 4K projector?</h3> <p>If you want to take full advantage of the advanced technology and sharp images possible with a 4K projector, purchasing a 4K screen is a good idea. These screens will feature a completely smooth texture, as opposed to a matte texture, which will allow 4K images to show up more clearly and with less distortion.</p> <h3>Q. How many lumens do I need to watch in daylight?</h3> <p>To ensure clear visibility, an outdoor projector should emit 2,500 ANSI lumens in daylight conditions.</p>",423

Summer camping might not require heavily insulated clothing, and campground stays don’t normally require GPS or personal locator beacons.</p> <h3>Q: What should you <em>not</em> bring camping?</h3> <p>There are certain things you shouldn’t bring camping. For one, anything that becomes dangerous when broken should stay home, like glassware or mirrors (aside from a signaling mirror). Also, other than essentials like GPS and phone, most electronics should stay behind. Also, certain scents in perfumes and hair products actually attract bugs, so you might consider leaving them home as well.</p> <h3>Q: How do you pitch a tent by yourself?</h3> <p>Most modern tents are very easy to pitch by yourself.</p> <ol><li>Spread the tent out on the ground.</li><li>Stake the corners into the ground.</li><li>Straighten poles and slide them together.</li><li>Insert through the pole sleeves or clips.</li><li>Place the pole ends in their appropriate pockets to create tension and raise the tent roof.</li><li>Use tent cords to create tension on the tent fabric.</li></ol> <h3>Q: What is a 3-season sleeping bag? </h3> <p>A sleeping bag labeled as 3-season means it will keep you warm in all but the coldest temperatures in winter, while not baking you alive as you sleep in summer.</p> <h3>Q: Is a sleeping pad necessary for camping?</h3> <p>“Necessary” is relative, but in most cases, a sleeping pad will improve your sleep tremendously. In colder temps, it can add a layer of insulation between your sleeping bag and the ground.</p>",375
545,artificial grass,"<h3>Q: Can dogs pee on artificial grass?</h3> <p>Dog and other animals’ urine may damage live grass, but it drains through the backing of artificial grass, leaving the surface undamaged.</p> <h3>Q: Can you put artificial grass on top of real grass?</h3> <p>You can, but you shouldn’t. Doing so can cause long-term problems like grass or weeds growing through the artificial grass backing as well as poor drainage that can shorten the lifespan of your artificial grass.</p> <h3>Q: What thickness of artificial grass is best?</h3> <p>The thickness or pile height depends on the preference of the user. Choose taller pile heights for high-traffic areas, like sports fields, to cushion the impact on the ground. Go with a short pile height for low-traffic landscape lawns or balconies that are rarely used.</p> <p>In general, artificial grass should have a pile height between 0.5 and 1 inch for low-traffic areas, 1 and 1.5 inches for moderate-traffic areas, and 1.5 and 2 inches for high-traffic areas.</p> <h3>Q: What is best to put under artificial grass?</h3> <p>Silica sand is one of the best options to put under artificial grass, but you can also use crushed granite, gravel, and limestone chippings. Just make sure that you do not lay the artificial grass directly on soil as this can lead to weeds, natural grass, and other plants growing up through the turf.</p> <h3>Q: How do you maintain artificial grass?</h3> <p>Artificial grass takes less work to maintain than a live lawn, but it’s not maintenance-free like some other lawn alternatives. To keep it looking great and prolong its lifespan, follow these maintenance tips:</p> <ul><li>Brush the lawn with a stiff-bristled broom to remove any leaves or twigs when necessary. You can also use a leaf blower to make the job easier.</li><li>Regularly trim hedges, trees, and other plants nearby to reduce the amount of lawn debris falling on the artificial grass.</li><li>Apply weed killer twice a year to keep weeds from growing through the backing.</li><li>If you have a pet, clean and deodorize the artificial grass with a special enzymatic cleaning spray, or use natural cleaners like baking soda or a water-and-vinegar solution.</li></ul> <h3>Q: How long will artificial grass last?</h3> <p>On average, artificial grass lasts 15 to 20 years. The amount of maintenance and traffic volume affects the life span of artificial grass.</p>",379

What is the difference between a mulcher and a chipper?</h3> <p>While both items will produce small bits of biodegradable material for use as mulch around plants or for adding to a compost pile, a leaf mulcher handles only leaves and tiny twigs, while a wood chipper can shred small tree branches.</p> <h3>Q. What can you put in a mulcher?</h3> <p>A leaf mulcher is only intended for dry leaves. Avoid sucking up acorns and twigs larger than ⅛ inch in diameter, and don’t mulch green leaves or grass clippings. Green plant matter can clog the blades of a leaf mulcher.</p> <h3>Q.

How do I fill a tiki torch with fuel?</h3> <p>First, open the lid to the canister. If the canister has a wide-mouth opening, carefully fill it with oil, making sure to wipe up any drips or spills afterward. If the canister has a small opening, use a funnel to fill the canister to avoid making a mess.</p> <h3>Q. How do you store tiki torch fuel?</h3> <p>It’s safe to leave leftover oil in a tiki torch when it’s not in use. However, if storing a torch for an extended period of time, make sure to store it upright to avoid spills. Store tiki torch fuel in a closed container and away from children and pets, preferably inside a locked shed or garage.</p>",325

555,grass for sandy soil,"<p>A hardy, resilient species of grass grows and thrives in sandy soil, but if you aren’t quite sure which type of grass is best or when is the best time to put down grass seed or sod, then continue reading. Several of the most frequently asked questions about the best grass for sandy soil are answered below.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of grass seed should be used for sandy soil?</h3> <p>The best grass seed varieties for growing in sandy soil include tall fescue, zoysia, Bermuda grass, centipede grass, and Bahia grass. These grasses form densely packed or deep roots that help absorb water and nutrients from the arid soil.</p> <h3>Q. What month is best to put grass seed down?</h3> <p>The ideal planting month for grass seed varies depending on where you live. However, the late summer and early autumn months are usually the best options due to the warm soil, moderate daytime temperatures, and cool nighttime temperatures that encourage rapid germination.</p> <h3>Q. How much compost should be added to sandy soil?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, growers should add about 0.25 to 0.5 inches of compost if placing it on top of the soil and 1 to 2 inches of compost if it is mixed into the soil.</p> <h3>Q.

It is important to test the soil annually to determine fertilizer requirements to avoid damaging the grass.</p> <h3>Q. How do I make my centipede grass dark green?</h3> <p>Healthy centipede grass, sometimes described as apple green, is naturally a lighter shade than other grasses. But if it is a sickly yellow-green color, it’s probably suffering from iron deficiency. Use Scotts Green Max Lawn Food to boost the soil’s iron level, add nitrogen, and unlock natural fertility for a deep green lawn.</p> <h3>Q. How do I apply fertilizer to my lawn?</h3> <p>Granular fertilizers should be applied with a walk-behind rotary or drop spreader. Use the spreader owner’s manual and the fertilizer label to calibrate the tool for proper coverage. A good way to avoid mistakes is to apply half of the recommended rate in parallel lines across the whole yard, then apply the other half in parallel lines at right angles to the first application. You’ll cover the whole yard twice, but doing so eliminates streaking.</p> <h3>Q. Can I apply fertilizer to wet grass?</h3> <p>Always consult the product label for explicit application instructions. In most cases, granular fertilizers should be applied to dry grass and then watered in. Liquid fertilizers should be applied while the dew is still on the lawn in the early morning.</p> <h3>Q. Should I water the lawn after applying the fertilizer?</h3> <p>Be sure to read your product label for application instructions. In most cases, granular fertilizers should be watered in after application. Most liquids need not be watered after application.</p> <div></div>",300

In fact, many commercial seed blends contain both bluegrass and fescue.</p> <h3>Q. Should I put topsoil over grass seed? </h3> <p>No, topsoil should be used to amend the existing soil before sowing the seeds. Spreading topsoil over seeds can result in smothering the tender new grass shoots.</p> <h3>Q. Will tall fescue choke out weeds? </h3> <p>Tall fescue will not spread to choke out weeds, but by cultivating a dense lawn of fescue, weed seeds will be less likely to sprout and grow.</p>",205
563,grass seed for overseeding,"<p>While overseeding a lawn is a relatively straightforward project, grass seed can be pricey, depending on the type, so it’s normal to have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q. When should I put my new grass seed down?</h3> <p>If you’re overseeding cool-season grasses, such as fescue, seed in early fall, which will give the new seedlings time to develop before winter. For seeding warm-season grasses, such as Bermuda, overseed in late spring when soil temperatures are around 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <h3>Q. How do I protect my new grass seed?</h3> <p>Water the lawn daily for the first 2 to 3 weeks after overseeding to provide adequate moisture for the seeds to germinate. Do not mow until the new seedlings have reached the height you usually mow.</p> <h3>Q. How much grass seed do I need?</h3> <p>This will vary depending on the type of seed and whether the seed is coated. The seed’s spread rate will be listed on the product packaging.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use my spreader to sow lawn grass seed?</h3> <p>Yes, a drop spreader or a broadcast spreader are suitable for overseeding the lawn. Overseeding lawn equipment also includes machines that make slits in the soil and then deposit the seeds in the slits. These machines, called “grass drills,” can be rented from landscape rental companies.</p> <h3>Q. Can I cover the seed?</h3> <p>Covering grass seed is traditionally limited to newly seeded lawns, not overseeded lawns. If you’re seeding bare patches where no grass is growing, feel free to cover the seed lightly with a layer of loose straw or use a seed product that contains mulch in the mix.</p> <h3>Q. Should I have ryegrass in my lawn seed mixture?</h3> <p>Perennial ryegrass is a mid-to-cool season grass that can be grown by itself or mixed with other cool-season grasses. Annual ryegrass may be found in warm-season mixes because it germinates quickly and provides a cover for the slower-to-germinate warm-season grasses.</p>",317

567,squirrel trap,"<p>If you’re wondering about the best bait to catch a squirrel when trapping or whether rat traps can work with squirrels, then keep reading for answers to these and other important questions about squirrel traps.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best bait to use to trap a squirrel?</h3> <p>Peanut butter is the best bait for squirrel traps. Squirrels, of course, are naturally attracted to nuts. Since peanut butter is not something squirrels can easily snatch and run away with, peanut butter forces them to engage with the trap long enough to spring it, making it the best squirrel bait.</p> <h3>Q. Will rat traps work on squirrels?</h3> <p>Snap traps that are used for catching rats also work for squirrels, which are similar in size. A squirrel investigating the bait on this trap can trigger the trap, killing the squirrel.</p> <h3>Q. Where is the best place to put a squirrel trap?</h3> <p>Place a squirrel trap along a squirrel’s normal travel path. If the squirrel is damaging your house, find a place along a fence or wall on which the squirrel travels to reach your home. Likewise, if a squirrel is frequenting a bird feeder, place the trap near the bird feeder. You can also place traps near the base of the trees where the squirrels live.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take to trap a squirrel?</h3> <p>It varies, depending on the amount of squirrel activity in your yard. Early winter and late spring are the best times to catch squirrels. This is also the time of year when you’re less likely to catch a squirrel mother, separating her from her dependent young.</p> <h3>Q. What to do with a squirrel after you catch it?</h3> <p>After you catch a squirrel, relocate it to a place far away from where you caught it. Make sure to release squirrels in a wooded area that contains plenty of food for them to eat.</p>",315

Why do you even need above-ground swimming pool steps?</h3> <p>Most above-ground swimming pools are between 48 and 52 inches off the ground, which is too high for even most adults to comfortably climb into the pool from the ground. Even a pool with a deck should have swimming pool stairs or a ladder to allow swimmers to easily exit the pool. Moreover, for a pool to meet local codes, all private pools must have a ladder when the water depth exceeds 5 feet.</p> <h3>Q. How much weight can an above-ground pool ladder or set of steps hold?</h3> <p>An above-ground pool ladder or set of steps can hold at least 300 pounds with some capable of holding well over 600 pounds.</p> <h3>Q. What size ladder do I need for a 52-inch pool?</h3> <p>An A-frame ladder for a 52-inch pool should extend 52 inches up to the 52-inch wall height. The first step on a set of deck pool stairs should be around 45 inches high for an above-ground pool with a 52-inch wall height.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep above-ground pools steps from floating?</h3> <p>If you’re having trouble keeping pool steps rooted to the floor of the pool, attach hand-size dumbbells to the bottom of the steps using bungee cords or rope. You can also purchase pool weights that fill with sand, which are designed to work with above-ground pools to weigh down the steps.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean above-ground pools steps?</h3> <p>Remove the steps from the pool, then scrub them with a solution of vinegar and hot water. The cleaner kills algae and mildew while removing stains.</p>",307

How long does it take for grass to grow in shade?</h3> <p>Fescue varieties are the quickest to germinate, as soon as 2 weeks in some cases. Buffalo grass seed can take 3 weeks or longer to germinate, and it grows slowly.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I water shade grass?</h3> <p>Water as frequently as necessary to keep the soil damp—but not soggy—until the seed germinates. After that, water as needed to keep the soil from becoming completely dry for the next three weeks. After that, water once per week.</p> <div><p></p><div><noscript></noscript></div><h3>DIY Lawn Care.

How deep should an inground pool be for slides?</h3> <p>The depth of the water into which sliders plummet should start at a minimum of 36 inches and gradually slope to a depth of between 42 and 56 inches as you move away from the slide’s exit. Do not install a pool slide over shallower depths, which could cause riders to strike the bottom of the pool.</p> <h3>Q. What is the weight limit for a pool slide?</h3> <p>Most residential deck pool slides have a weight limit of up to 275 pounds; however, some smaller slides designed for kids may have a significantly lower limit of less than 125 pounds. The inflatable WOW World of Watersports Slide N Smile Waterslide, designed to accommodate two simultaneous sliders, has a weight capacity of 550 pounds.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a playground slide for an inground pool slide?</h3> <p>You can use a playground slide for an inground pool slide as long as you follow certain safety guidelines when installing it. Make sure the slide extends a foot over the edge to ensure riders won’t strike the edge of the deck. The slide’s steps should also have nonslip treads and handles to prevent wet swimmers from sliding off the steps.</p> <h3>Q. Can you put an inground pool slide on an above-ground pool?</h3> <p>If your inground pool is surrounded by a rigid deck, you can mount an inground slide to the deck for use with the pool. As with any installation, make sure there is adequate water depth of at least 3 feet and that the pool is wide enough to prevent sliders from hitting the opposite wall of the above-ground pool.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to make a water slide slippery?</h3> <p>While it’s possible to make a pool slide more slippery with soap, this will throw off the pool’s pH. Instead, purchase a slide with a water supply that allows you to keep the slide’s surface wet while in use.</p> <h3>Q. How much do slides for inground pools cost?</h3> <p>Pool slides vary significantly in cost depending on the type. Inflatable slides range from $100 for the cheapest models to as much as $300 for higher-end slides made with durable PVC. Rigid slides are more expensive, ranging from around $2,000 for smaller slides to more than $4,000 for large rotomolded plastic models.</p>",432

Then apply additional treatments as recommended on the package.</p> <h3>Q. How often can I apply fungicide to the lawn?</h3> <p>It depends on the product. Some fungicides can be reapplied every 2 weeks while others last up to 4 weeks, so follow the manufacturer’s recommended instructions.</p> <h3>Q. Can I apply lawn fungicide and fertilizer at the same time?</h3> <p>If you’re applying a granular fungicide that needs to be watered to dissolve, you can usually apply a fertilizer simultaneously.</p> <h3>Q.

574,fences for dogs,"<p>Understandably, there are a lot of concerns that come along with letting your dog off leash, even in the confines of your own yard. Whether you’re looking for an invisible fence or a physical one, getting familiar with the best ways to keep your pup safe is always a priority. We’ve answered some of the most frequently asked questions about fences for dogs below.</p> <h3>Q. How high a dog fence do I need?</h3> <p>For small dogs, a fence that’s 3 to 4 feet high will usually suffice, but for a larger dog that’s an expert jumper, fences that are 6 to 8 feet tall will be more effective.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most durable fence for dogs?</h3> <p>Vinyl, wood, and metal fencing are all durable options for dog fences. For a fence that will withstand even the most intense elements, metal is always a good choice.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most cost-effective fence for dogs?</h3> <p>Vinyl fencing is typically the most affordable option when it comes to dog fences.</p> <h3>Q. Are invisible fences safe?</h3> <p>Yes—invisible fences are considered safe for dogs and won’t hurt them.

How do I stop a dog from breaking a fence?</h3> <p>The best way to stop a dog from breaking a fence is to make sure the fence is tall enough and made from durable materials.

575,invisible dog fence,"<p>If you still have some questions about invisible dog fences, this section might help. Below are some of the most frequently asked questions and answers about the best invisible fences. If you still have questions, feel free to contact the manufacturer’s customer service line.</p> <h3>Q: How does an invisible dog fence work?</h3> <p>Wireless dog fences send radio waves that the dog’s collar receives. Underground dog fences send signals through the wire for the dog’s collar to pick up. Depending on the dog’s proximity to the edge of the invisible fence border, the strength of the frequency will change.</p> <p>As the dog moves closer to the border, the collar will discourage a dog from crossing the invisible fence by warning, alerting, and then correcting the dog.</p> <h3>Q: Does an invisible fence hurt dogs?</h3> <p>The reality is that the static correction does temporarily hurt. It is recommended to use the minimum amount of correction to help correct behavior. As long as you buy a high-quality kit, static correction is completely safe.</p> <h3>Q: Will my neighbors’ invisible fence interfere with mine?</h3> <p>Neighboring invisible fences can interfere with each other. Two wires that run too closely together can cancel each other’s signal, effectively allowing your dogs to travel back and forth between yards.</p> <h3>Q: Can I place the wire above the ground?</h3> <p>Yes, you can place a wire above the ground. You also can run the wire through your physical fencing and flower beds if needed. While it will work fine, running your wire above ground leaves the wire susceptible to damage from lawnmowers, string trimmers, and other yard activities.</p> <h3>Q: How do you install an invisible dog fence?</h3> <p>Wireless fences are plug-and-play. Just plug in the transmitter and adjust its range to work for your yard. For underground fences, you need to loop the wire around your dog’s play space while also cordoning off any puppy-free zones. Both ends of the wire then tie into the transmitter, which requires a power source. You can bury your wire underground or use landscaping staples to hold it in place.</p>",344
576,dog repellents,"<p>Though you now know more about dog repellents, you may still have questions about how to use them. The following are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about how to select and use dog repellents around the home.</p> <h3>Q. How do dog spray deterrents work?</h3> <p>A dog repellent spray typically contains ingredients that are unpleasant for dogs to smell, which deters them from the area. Some sprays also use a sharp blast of air, which startles a dog and corrects any unwanted behavior.</p> <h3>Q. Which dog repellent is best?</h3> <p>Our top choice overall is the Orbit dog repellent, which is ideal for outdoor use. We recommend Nature’s Miracle repellent spray for preventing dogs from marking and having accidents indoors.</p> <h3>Q. How do I keep dogs out of my yard naturally?</h3> <p>The best natural way to keep dogs away from your yard is with a motion-activated sprinkler. We recommend the Orbit dog repellent as the best dog repellent for lawns.</p> <h3>Q. What scents will keep dogs away?</h3> <p>Several natural scents keep dogs at bay, including vinegar, citrus fruits, and essential oils made from herbs like rosemary and mint.</p> <h3>Q. What frequency is most annoying to dogs?</h3> <p>Dogs tend to be annoyed by frequencies of around 25,000 hertz.</p> <h3>Q. What sounds are dogs afraid of?</h3> <p>Dogs tend to be afraid of loud noises—like fireworks and thunder—but can also be deterred by certain sound frequencies.</p> <h3>Q. What can I use to deter dogs from attacking me?</h3> <p>When shopping for an aggressive dog repellent, it can be difficult to find something that’s both humane and effective. Citronella-based sprays are a great option because they’re made with natural ingredients. While citronella-based sprays are safer than pepper spray, they still may be an irritant to dogs.</p>",293

Take a look below to find the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about using a grill and grate cleaner.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to clean grill grates?</h3> <p>The best way to clean grill grates is with a heavy-duty cleaner that can cut through the grease without damaging the metal.

Can you clean a grill without a brush?</h3> <p>A grill brush is one of the most basic tools for cleaning a grill. It gets rid of large stuck-on pieces, but you can clean a grill without a brush. Simply spray stainless steel cleaner on the exterior of the grill or apply it to a cloth to wipe away dirt, dust, and grime. Then spray a heavy-duty cleaner on the grill grates, and use a cloth to clean off dirt, grime, oils, and other residue.</p> <p>Alternatively, remove the grill grates and place them in a large bucket or tub where they can soak for a short period of time in a grill-cleaning solution before being rinsed and dried.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean the outside of a grill?</h3> <p>When it comes to cleaning the grill, it isn’t all about scrubbing the grill grates or emptying the drip pans.

It can also be unsafe to store pool chemicals in an area that’s accessible to children and pets. With this in mind, store pool supplies in a shed or the garage.</p> <h3>Q. How much do pool supplies cost?</h3> <p>The cost of pool supplies varies. Pool brushes, skimmers, and manual vacuums are relatively inexpensive, whereas pool cleaning robots can cost hundreds of dollars.

Are leather gloves good for gardening?</h3> <p>Yes, leather work gloves are thick and sturdy. This material offers the best protection against thorns, branches, and other sharp plant parts while pruning or trimming bushes, hedges, and trees. They’re not well suited to pulling wet weeds, however, as leather can become slick, making it difficult to get a good hold on the weeds.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for in gardening gloves?</h3> <p>The garden gloves you purchase will depend on the gardening task you want to perform. For instance, if working with rose bushes, rose-pruning gloves are best. If working in warm weather, you might want cotton gloves.

Below are answers to some of the most popular questions about raised garden beds.</p> <h3>Q. What type of raised garden bed is best for flowers?</h3> <p>One that offers at least 9 inches of soil depth to allow the flower roots to develop fully is best, and it’s important to get one that drains well.</p> <h3>Q. What do I put on the bottom of a raised garden bed?</h3> <p>Placing potting soil at least 8 inches deep will keep weeds in ground-level beds from coming up to compete with the desirable plants, so nothing is needed for those. However, shallower raised beds will benefit from a layer of cardboard or old newspapers that will act as a biodegradable weed barrier.</p> <h3>Q. How deep should a raised garden bed be?</h3> <p>A raised garden should be deep enough to allow plant roots to develop freely. For compact herbs and flowers, that may be as little as 6 to 8 inches, while vegetables such as eggplant and kale will do better with soil 12 to 18 inches deep or deeper.</p>",233
590,leaf rake,"<p>An annual pastime in many communities after trees lose their leaves, raking can be a more enjoyable task. The right leaf rake speeds the chore and simplifies the work. Those new to choosing a leaf rake are likely to have some questions. Answers to some common questions about these tools appear next.</p> <h3>Q. Is raking good for your lawn?</h3> <p>While a few leaves here or there might not harm anything, a thick layer of autumn leaves can become damp and soggy, blocking sun and air circulation from the lawn and increasing the risk of fungal diseases. Raking the leaves helps remove excess coverage that could damage the grass.</p> <h3>Q. What is a leaf rake used for?</h3> <p>A leaf rake is lightweight and specially designed to gather dry leaves from the surface of the yard. Some are well suited for additional yard tasks like removing twigs and sticks after pruning or smoothing out a seed bed for planting.</p> <h3>Q. How long is a leaf rake?</h3> <p>Handheld leaf rakes (for raised beds) can be as short as 15 inches, while full-size leaf rakes may be 72 inches long or longer.</p> <h3>Q. Is a metal rake or a plastic rake better for leaves?</h3> <p>Both metal and plastic rakes expedite leaf raking, but metal usually lasts longer. However, the new polyresin in many of today’s plastic-type rakes is more durable than the plastic of yesteryear.</p> <h3>Q. What do you do with raked leaves?</h3> <p>Add raked leaves to a compost pile or layer them around the base of trees and other plants for a bit of thermal protection during winter. Alternatively, bag them and contact the local waste authority for curbside pickup.</p>",277
591,garden fertilizer,"<h3>Q. When should I fertilize my garden?</h3> <p>The best time to fertilize plants is when you place them in the ground, beginning with added compost or a starter fertilizer.

What is the best fertilizer for vegetables?</h3> <p>Vegetables need a good start, since they typically have a short, one-time growing season. Start them out with a boost of nutrients and good soil, then apply a balanced fertilizer for vegetables and herbs like Dr. Earth Home Grown Organic Fertilizer.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best fertilizer for garden plants?</h3> <p>The best fertilizer depends on the plants. Many native plants need little to no fertilizer, assuming they are growing in decent soils. But flowering plants often need a boost so the plant can stay healthy plus send extra energy into producing lots of large, colorful flowers. Try Jobe’s Organics 9621 Fertilizer for beautiful blooms.</p> <h3>Q. When should I apply 10-10-10 fertilizer to my vegetable garden?</h3> <p>Apply most balanced (10-10-10) fertilizers monthly during the growing season to boost the health of perennial plants. But be sure to check the package directions, since some fertilizers have slow-release formulas that last longer.</p> <h3>Q. How do you naturally fertilize soil?</h3> <p>Nutrient-rich soil is the best type to grow in, and keeping soil balanced and with plenty of humus is preferred by many gardeners over adding fertilizer regularly. Get healthy soil with annual additions of organic compost such as manure, homemade compost from kitchen scraps, and even leaves or grass clippings. Mix up the ingredients for the best effect, and use organic fertilizer as needed.</p> <h3>Q. Are eggshells good for fertilizer?</h3> <p>Ground-up eggshells can add some calcium and other nutrients. They won’t necessarily provide all nutrients all plants need, and they break down slowly, so effects are not immediate. Still, adding them can be part of any effort to keep soil health up; they do not contain enough of any ingredient to harm plants.</p>",344
592,hose nozzle,"<p>After learning about the different features of hose nozzles, some new questions might spring up. After all, there are a lot of choices on the market, and you still might not be sure which garden hose nozzle is ideal for you. This section aims to offer that info, as it answers some of the most frequently asked questions about the best hose nozzles.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best garden hose spray nozzle?</h3> <p>Finding the best garden hose spray nozzle depends on several factors, and it’s usually on a case-by-case basis. For watering pots, we appreciated the gentle rain-like spray of the Dramm hose nozzle, and for those who might want the comfort of a lighter weight hose nozzle, check out the Gilmour hose nozzle. While using a hose nozzle takes more hands-on watering time—as opposed to setting a sprinkler and then using a hose timer to turn the water on and off, nozzle is more versatile in its application because it can be used for a range of watering and washing chores.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best watering wand?</h3> <p>Watering wands can be tricky, as they’re often too long and cumbersome to be truly useful. The Relaxed Gardener Watering Wand is one of the best watering wands, as it lets you reach hanging baskets but not so long that it’s difficult to handle.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best high-pressure hose nozzle?</h3> <p>Often, fire-hose-style nozzles offer the most concentrated pressure. They can restrict the opening while still allowing a jet stream of water to flow through for maximum pressure.</p> <h3>Q. Why do hose nozzles leak?</h3> <p>There are several reasons a hose nozzle might leak:</p> <ul><li>If it’s leaking at the hose connection, it’s likely that the rubber ring inside the nozzle is either in poor condition or missing.</li><li>If it’s leaking at the tip, the O-rings inside the nozzle might be broken, deteriorated, or missing. Most nozzles aren’t serviceable, so they’ll likely need to be replaced.</li><li>The other leading cause for a leak is a crack or corrosion within the nozzle. If corrosion removes metal or creates an uneven seal inside the nozzle, it will leak. Also, if the nozzle was dropped, there could be a crack inside, causing the leak.</li></ul> <h3>Q. How do I keep my hose nozzle from leaking?</h3> <p>The first thing to try to repair a leak is to replace the rubber washer inside the hose connection. Very often, these rubber rings wear down or fall out, causing the handle to leak any time the hose is changed. You also can try wrapping the hose thread with a few passes of pipe tape.</p> <p>One thing to avoid is overtightening the nozzle, as the leak will probably worsen, and you could ruin the threads on the hose and the nozzle.</p>",458
593,watering can,"<p>Now that you know more about watering cans, there may be some new questions popping up. For more information, check out these answers to some common queries. For other questions, contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q. Why should I use a watering can?</h3> <p>A watering can lets you direct the water and control its flow. For certain plants or seedlings outdoors, a hose can be too strong and can cause damage. For an indoor garden with plants like succulents or cacti, a cup could make a mess. A long spout on a watering can helps direct the pour to the base of the plant for better watering without getting water outside of the pot. Different types of watering cans have various functions that help in keeping plants and flowers beautiful.</p> <h3>Q. How big is a standard watering can?</h3> <p>Most watering cans hold between 1 and 2 gallons of water.</p> <h3>Q. Are plastic or metal watering cans better?</h3> <p>Choosing plastic or metal depends on your particular needs and likes as both can last and get the job done. Plastic watering cans are lightweight and durable—they never rust and will last indefinitely provided they’re not stored in direct sunlight. They also tend to be less expensive than metal watering cans.</p> <p>Galvanized steel, stainless steel, and aluminum metal watering cans will not rust, but they will be heavier than plastic watering cans. Aluminum is the lightest of the three. Copper and brass watering cans will rust, but they can be used as decor when not in use.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a watering can?</h3> <p>Choosing a watering can depends on what needs to be watered and whether you’re using it for indoor or outdoor plants. Also, deciding how much you can carry is a factor. If the can is large, you may not be able to fill it without it becoming too heavy. For those who can only pour using both hands, you may want a long handle that curves up. All of these factors will help you decide which is the best watering can for you.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

594,pruning shears,"<p>Pruning shears vary as to type and purpose, so gardeners frequently have two or more pairs in their garden tool collection.</p> <h3>Q. What is the use of pruning shears?</h3> <p>Pruners are meant for cutting branches, twigs, and stems in your garden. They can also be used by florists and professional gardeners.</p> <h3>Q. Which is better, bypass or anvil pruners?</h3> <p>Bypass shears are better for cutting through soft green stems, while anvil pruners are better for cutting through dry, woody stems.</p> <h3>Q. What are the best pruners for roses?</h3> <p>Use a bypass pruner for cutting through fresh green rose stems when collecting blooms for a bouquet, but use an anvil pruner, such as the Gardena Anvil Pruning Shears, to remove dead branches at the base of the rose.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use scissors for pruning?</h3> <p>Not unless you want to ruin your scissors. Household scissors are not suited for cutting through thick stems. A pair of pruning shears is the best bet.</p>",161
595,landscape fabric,"<p>Landscape fabrics aren’t always easy to install, but these weed barriers help to protect flower beds and prevent weed growth. Keep reading to find the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about weed barrier landscape fabric.</p> <h3>Q: What are the different grades of landscape fabric?</h3> <p>Landscape fabric is typically separated based on the type of material used to make the product. These types include woven, perforated, and nonwoven landscaping fabric.</p> <p>Each type has its own benefits depending on the application, so think about whether you are looking to protect a flower bed, vegetable garden, or a walkway when deciding on the best weed control solution for your next landscaping project.</p> <h3>Q: How does landscape fabric let water through?</h3> <p>Landscape fabric is designed to block out UV radiation as well as prevent weed seeds from growing, but this weed barrier fabric allows water and some air to pass through. This is possible due to construction of the fabric.</p> <p>Even thick and durable fabric is either woven or has perforated holes to allow water to seep into the ground, though it should be noted that some fabrics can greatly reduce the flow of water, leading to standing puddles after big rainstorms.</p> <h3>Q: Is filter fabric the same as landscape fabric?</h3> <p>Filter fabric is a similar product to landscape fabric, but it’s usually thinner and doesn’t have the same UV resistance, leaving it susceptible to premature degradation. To protect your flower beds, invest in thick landscape fabric that will be able to block the weeds and stand up to the sun and rain.</p> <h3>Q: Do you put soil on top of landscape fabric?</h3> <p>In most cases, landscape fabric is laid down and secured over the soil in a garden or around the base of a tree or bush in the yard. After the installation, you can put mulch on top of the landscape fabric to protect the fabric from foot traffic and UV rays. You also can use gravel or crushed rock as the top layer.</p> <h3>Q: What do you put under landscape fabric?</h3> <p>The purpose of landscape fabric is to prevent weed growth. This is achieved by pulling all the weeds in the garden, then installing landscaping fabric directly over the soil. Some users also put sand or gravel underneath the landscaping fabric to help level the ground,, though this isn’t necessary. This is especially true since mulch, gravel, and crushed stone are often spread over the top of the fabric.</p>",412
596,compact greenhouse,"<p>You may still have some additional questions about the best compact greenhouses. This section aims to answer some of the most frequently asked questions about mini greenhouses to help you decide if purchasing one is right for you.</p> <h3>Q: What is a mini greenhouse for? </h3> <p>A mini greenhouse is used for protecting plants from harsh temperatures, wind, pests, and other critters. It’s a handy addition to smaller gardens or patios for extending the growing season and growing seeds, seedlings, or mature plants in cooler temperatures.</p> <h3>Q: What is the smallest size greenhouse?</h3> <p>Greenhouses vary widely in size and can have footprints of less than 1 square foot for germinating seeds in a small indoor space.</p> <h3>Q: Should a greenhouse be clear or opaque?</h3> <p>Clear and opaque greenhouse siding provide different types of light. Clear siding gives plants access to direct sunlight, which is ideal for germinating seeds and starting seedlings. On the other hand, opaque siding provides diffuse light, which is the better choice for growing plants to maturity because it prevents hot spots.</p> <h3>Q: How thick does the plastic need to be for a greenhouse?</h3> <p>For optimal quality and durability, look for a greenhouse with a plastic cover that’s at least 6 mils (or 0.006 inches) thick.</p> <h3>Q: Can I put a greenhouse in the shade? </h3> <p>No, you can’t put a greenhouse in the shade. Both full-size and miniature greenhouses rely on sunlight, so they should be placed in a location that receives full sun—6 to 8 hours of sunlight—throughout the day.</p>",253
597,pots for succulents,"<p>Succulents come in many shapes, colors, textures, and sizes, but you can use the same basic care methods for most varieties.</p> <h3>Q. What type of soil is best for succulents?</h3> <p>Succulents grow best in porous, sandy soil. For optimal results, purchase a potting soil mix specially formulated for cacti and succulents.</p> <h3>Q. How do you care for succulents?</h3> <p>Succulents generally do best with a combination of direct and indirect sunlight. Although they are drought-tolerant plants, that doesn’t mean they only thrive in desert-like conditions. Monitor their direct sun exposure to avoid burning the foliage but also remember they don’t tolerate cold outside weather.</p> <h3>Q. How do you water succulents?</h3> <p>Most people overwater houseplants, which leads to root rot and dead plants. The best way to avoid that is not to pour frequent small amounts of water on them. Instead, wait until the soil is dry and then soak them until water drains from the bottom of the pot. Don’t forget to empty water out of the saucers beneath the plants, as well.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

598,snake repellent,"<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to select the right snake repellent for your lawn or garden, check out the answers to a few frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: What keeps snakes away from your house?</h3> <p>When there is no food or shelter attraction for snakes, combined with an unpleasant environment, they stay away.</p> <h3>Q: What smells do snakes hate?</h3> <p>Snakes hate the scents of cinnamon oil, clove oil, and ammonia.</p> <h3>Q: How do I rid my yard of snakes?</h3> <p>To eliminate snakes in the yard, first eliminate the habitat that attracts them and their prey. Then use a snake repellent to drive them out and keep them out.</p> <h3>Q: Can snakes come up through the toilet?</h3> <p>Yes, either from the top or bottom. More commonly, snakes that find their way into the house, and then to the bathroom can get into the toilet in search of water. Much less commonly, snakes can also get into the sewer and then follow the sewer pipe and plumbing up into your toilet.</p>",169
599,insecticide for vegetable gardens,"<p>Now that you know more about vegetable garden insecticides, there may be new questions about how to use them. Before you enter a battle with bugs, check out the following answers to common questions about the best insecticides for vegetable gardens.</p> <h3>Q: How do I keep bugs out of my vegetable garden? </h3> <p>Insects tend to attack unhealthy plants. To keep pests away from your veggies, start by providing plentiful sunlight, fertile soil, and good air circulation, along with consistent water that plants need to thrive. Allow beneficial species like praying mantises, garden spiders, and ladybugs to stay in the garden and feast on pests. When necessary, apply an insecticide that will quickly and efficiently eliminate insect pests.</p> <h3>Q: What can I spray on my vegetable garden to kill bugs?</h3> <p>The possibilities are numerous. Do your best to identify the culprit before choosing and applying garden insecticides. Bonide Pyrethrin Garden Insect Spray Mix is the best overall product because it kills a wide variety of insect pests, is easy to apply, and limits damage to non-targeted insects when applied as directed.</p> <h3>Q: What pesticides are safe for vegetable gardens? </h3> <p>There are numerous organic and nonorganic pesticides that are safe for vegetable gardens when applied according to label directions. Pay special attention to the recommended timing of the application for each crop to avoid damaging plants or non-target insects.</p> <h3>Q: What is the safest pesticide for vegetables?</h3> <p>An argument could be made for Neem Bliss as one of the safest pesticides for vegetable gardens. It is plant based and nontoxic to people. Still, be cautious to protect non-targeted species like bees and other beneficial bugs. Follow the label directions carefully, and avoid spraying flowering plants, especially during times of high pollinator activity.</p>",290
600,fertilizer for tomatoes,"<p>Before applying that new fertilizer, have a look at these answers to frequently asked tomato fertilizer questions.</p> <h3>Q: How much fertilizer do tomatoes need?</h3> <p>Timing, frequency, and application rates vary by product. Be sure to follow the application instructions on the fertilizer label.</p> <h3>Q: How do you put fertilizer on tomato plants?</h3> <p>Apply granules either by incorporating them into the soil before planting or by spreading them on the soil surface after planting. Prepare liquids according to the label instructions and drench the soil around the tomato plant.</p> <h3>Q: How often do you fertilize tomato plants?</h3> <p>Each fertilizer product breaks down or is used by the tomato plant a little differently. If using granules, applying two or three applications through the growing season usually suffices. Apply a liquid fertilizer every two or three weeks. Use caution and read product labels.</p>",140
601,fertilizer spreader,"<p>Now that you’ve chosen the best fertilizer spreader for your yard, you may have a few questions. The following are answers to some frequently asked questions about operating and caring for fertilizer spreaders.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a fertilizer spreader?</h3> <p>Refer to your spreader owner’s manual to find the correct setting for the product you will spread. The product label tells you how many pounds to apply per 1,000 square feet.</p> <p>Load the hopper with enough product for the square footage of the area you will cover. Select the correct setting for the material you spread, squeeze the handle, and walk from one corner of the yard, continuing in straight parallel lines until the area is covered.</p> <h3>Q. How do you spread fertilizer without a spreader?</h3> <p>You can spread fertilizer by hand, though your results might not be as consistent as they are with a spreader. Don gloves and pour granular fertilizer into a plastic bucket. Start to walk at one corner of the yard and toss fertilizer or other product out in a sweeping motion as you walk in straight lines across the area. You want to pace your walk so that you spread the product as evenly as possible and don’t run out of fertilizer until the end.</p> <p>For more even coverage, apply half the fertilizer while you walk in parallel lines in one direction, then apply the other half while you walk in a perpendicular set of parallel lines.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a fertilizer spreader?</h3> <p>Empty the hopper. Use compressed air or a rag to remove all granules and residue that may be caught in spreader parts. Thoroughly wash the spreader, and pay close attention to crevices and moving parts where debris may lodge. Allow the spreader to dry thoroughly. Store it in a dry location out of direct sunlight.</p>",306
602,hummingbird feeders,"<p>Now that you’ve had a chance to shop for the best hummingbird feeders, you may still have a few questions. Continue reading for answers to some frequently asked questions about feeding hummingbirds.</p> <h3>Q. Is glass or plastic better for a hummingbird feeder?</h3> <p>Glass hummingbird feeders are generally easy to clean and very durable. Plastic hummingbird feeders are subject to warping or cracking over time but are comparatively inexpensive. Both are acceptable to hummingbirds.</p> <h3>Q. Why do hummingbirds prefer red feeders?</h3> <p>Hummingbirds are highly attracted to red and yellow. Either or both colors are good choices for hummingbird feeders.</p> <h3>Q. Where is the best place to hang a hummingbird feeder?</h3> <p>Hummingbirds prefer feeders near sheltered places like trees, shrubs, or even tall perennials, where they can scavenge for other foods like spiders and natural nectar. Placing the feeder in a shaded location helps to reduce spoilage of the nectar.</p> <h3>Q. How should you clean your hummingbird feeder?</h3> <p>Once or twice per week, clean your hummingbird feeder with hot, soapy water. Liquid dish detergent works well. Rinse with cold water and allow to air dry before refilling.</p> <h3>Q. What should you feed hummingbirds?</h3> <p>Make your hummingbird nectar by mixing one part sugar with four parts water. Heat the water to boiling, then stir in the sugar. Turn off the heat and stir the water until the sugar completely dissolves. Allow the nectar to cool, then fill the hummingbird feeder. Do not add red dye or food coloring. Store extra hummingbird nectar in the refrigerator for up to a week.</p>",257
603,shovel,"<p>Shovels are simple tools, but they come in a wide range of types and sizes that make them appropriate for a variety of tasks, including gardening, planting bushes or shrubs, and digging fence postholes. For more information about these common gardening tools, read on to find the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about shovels.</p> <h3>Q.

604,mosquito repellent,"<p>Take a look below to find the answers to a few of the most commonly asked questions about mosquito repellent.</p> <h3>Q: How do mosquito repellents work?</h3> <p>Mosquitoes use their sense of smell to find a readily available source of blood. Repellents are designed to go on the skin, where they evaporate and block this sense of smell, rendering you somewhat invisible to the mosquitoes. Although they still might happen upon you as they fly through the air, they cannot actively track you by the smell of your blood.</p> <h3>Q: How often should you reapply a repellent?</h3> <p>Depending on the type of repellent you use, you should reapply repellent every 2 to 10 hours. However, you should always refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations and the directions for use located on the can or bottle of repellent.</p> <h3>Q:What clothes help protect you from mosquito bites?</h3> <p>Tightly-woven fabrics, like those used for high-quality athletic gear, help to block mosquitoes from reaching your skin. You can also wear a long-sleeve shirt and long pants, though cotton and linen are not as effective as polyester, nylon, and rayon.</p>",183

Read on to learn more about choosing the best potting soil.</p> <h3>Q: Which is better: potting soil or potting mix?</h3> <p>Potting soil and potting mix are two names for the same type of product. Also, watch for the terms “container soil” and “container mix.” All four of these products are “potting soil.” Avoid buying a product labeled “topsoil” or “gardening soil” for container plants without first checking the label. These products are intended for in-ground use.</p> <h3>Q: Which kind of soil is best for growing plants?</h3> <p>Plants need consistent moisture, good aeration, a steady nutrient supply, and a solid anchoring system. Potting soil is the best kind of soil for growing plants in containers because it provides all these characteristics.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between indoor and outdoor potting soil?</h3> <p>Indoor potting soil dries out too quickly to be used outdoors, while outdoor potting soil retains too much moisture to be used indoors. If you want to buy only one product, all-purpose potting soil is designed to work well indoors or out.</p>",187
606,rose fertilizer,"<p>Are you looking for quick and concise answers to your rose fertilization questions? If so, check out the FAQs below.</p> <h3>Q. How do you fertilize roses?</h3> <p>Depending on the type of fertilizer used, you either “scratch” into the soil beneath your plants, pour it into the soil at the bases of those plants, or spray it on their foliage. If you opt for fertilizer spikes, you dig and drive the spike into the ground near the root.</p> <h3>Q. How do you know if roses need fertilizer?</h3> <p>If your plants appear stunted with yellowish, purplish, or burnt-looking leaves, they may be suffering from lack of nutrients.</p> <h3>Q.

607,patio furniture,"<p>For questions on which patio furniture is the most durable or how to store it during the off-season, we have the answers to these and other common questions about patio furniture.</p> <h3>Q. Which is better, wicker or metal patio furniture?</h3> <p>It depends on your preferences—and your needs. Wood wicker won’t stand up to the elements as well as metal patio furniture. However, all-weather synthetic wicker will offer protection from rain and humidity, but it won’t be as weighted for windy conditions.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of metal patio furniture doesn’t rust?</h3> <p>Aluminum doesn’t contain any iron or steel; therefore, it won’t rust. A powder coating on other metals will also protect them from rust.</p> <h3>Q. What type of patio furniture is the most durable?</h3> <p>Cast aluminum patio furniture will generally be the most durable due to its heft and weather resistance and rust resistance.</p> <h3>Q. How do you store outdoor furniture for the winter?</h3> <p>If you have the space, store your furniture inside a shed, garage, or basement. If you don’t have room indoors, cover your setup with an outdoor furniture cover.</p>",181
608,pitchforks,"<h3>Q: What are pitchforks used for?</h3> <p>There are several uses for pitchforks, including scooping hay and grain for livestock, cleaning manure, digging in soil, turning compost, aerating gardens and grass, as well as harvesting some root-type vegetables.</p> <h3>Q: What is a spading fork used for?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, spading forks are for lifting soil around plants gently and carrying it to another place. They’re also useful for cultivating soil and turning manure or fertilizer into loose dirt.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between a digging fork and a border fork?</h3> <p>They’re relatively closely related, but the main difference between a digging fork and a border fork is that the border fork is much smaller, meant for working in tighter spaces.</p> <h3>Q: What makes a good garden fork?</h3> <p>There are a few things to look for in a garden fork, but the most important are the tines and handle. The overall length should be roughly around 40 inches, and the tines should be a quality metal like carbon or tool steel, and the handle should be wood, fiberglass, or metal for long-term durability.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a pitchfork to loosen soil?</h3> <p>To loosen soil, plunge your pitchfork’s tines deep into the ground. Then, push and pull the handle back and forth a few times. This action loosens the soil underneath the garden without disturbing the plants on top.</p> <h3>Q: How dangerous are pitchforks?</h3> <p>If you use your pitchfork correctly, it is safe. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however:</p> <ol><li>Don’t kick down the shoulder of the pitchfork; push it with your foot instead. Kicking can cause the handle to swing around at your body or face with quite a bit of force.</li><li>Be sure the tines are in contact with the soil before you step on it. The pitchfork will be much easier to control, and you’re less likely to strike yourself with the tines or handle.</li></ol>",319
609,deer repellent,"<p>To effectively solve your deer problem, make sure to follow the directions on your chosen deer repellent method. Each product has a different strategy to repel critters; some methods may be a permanent solution, while others may need reapplication or maintenance over time. Here are some frequently asked questions about deer repellents.</p> <h3>Q: What smells repel deer?</h3> <p>Deer dislike certain strong smells and smells they perceive to be dangerous. Deer repellents may use odorous smells like eggs, garlic, and cloves or ingredients that contain or mimic biological smells, like blood or predator urine.</p> <h3>Q: When should I apply deer repellent?</h3> <p>Start applying repellents when new plants emerge in the spring and with continued growth throughout the summer. Depending on the deer patterns in your area, you may prefer to use deer repellents year-round.</p> <h3>Q: How do I apply deer repellent?</h3> <p>Application will depend on the type of deer repellent you choose. Deer repellents can come in the form of devices, sprays, concentrates, granules, and more.</p> <h3>Q: When should I water my plants after applying deer repellent?</h3> <p>When using spray deer repellents, you should wait to water plants until the repellent is fully dry. Most products will specify how long to wait before watering your plants.</p> <p><span><em>Jasmine Harding is a freelance writer and avid traveler.

They also help you relax and learn by simply flipping through and picking out the parts that grab your attention.</p> <h3>Q: What is meant by “organic” gardening? </h3> <p>Organic gardening is a system that relies on good soil health and sound cultural practices to produce healthy plants without synthetic chemicals. Organic fertilizers are derived from composted manure, bone meal, kelp, cottonseed meal, and many other naturally occurring ingredients that feed and promote an abundance of beneficial soil microbes. Insect control and disease control are similarly derived from natural ingredients.</p> <h3>Q: What is the easiest vegetable to grow? </h3> <p>Beans and peas sprout quickly and grow well in nutrient-poor soil. They also improve the soil for crops that follow them.</p> <h3>Q: What vegetables should not be placed next to each other?</h3> <p>Separate botanically related plants to reduce pressure from common pests. For instance, tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant are all members of the nightshade family, and all are susceptible to damage from tomato fruitworms. Plant them in different areas of the garden to isolate fruitworm pressure. Refer to your garden books to learn more about plant families and companion planting.</p>",235
611,soil for succulents,"<p>Do you still have burning questions about soil for succulents? Here are a few answers to frequently asked questions on the subject.</p> <h3>Q: Do you need special soil for succulents?</h3> <p>Yes. Succulents (and cacti) are native to dry, arid climates, so they prefer sandy, well-draining soils. If you were to use the soil in your vegetable garden, which is formulated to retain water for thirsty plants, your succulents would quickly die off. Specially formulated soil mixes designed for your succulent plant are recommended, especially for new gardeners.</p> <h3>Q: What type of soil is best for succulents?</h3> <p>A sandy, well-draining soil is ideal. A soil composed of at least 50 percent materials like perlite, sand, and other minerals will help promote drainage. The higher the mineral content, the better the drainage.</p> <h3>Q: Can I plant succulents in just rocks?</h3> <p>Rocks are a helpful addition to succulent soil mixes because they improve drainage. Water slips through stones easily. However, succulents need some soil to survive; otherwise they do not have access to nutrients. If you spot a rock garden adorned with succulents, you might not see the bottom layer of soil underneath, but it’s definitely there.</p> <h3>Q: Can I plant succulents in pots without holes?</h3> <p>You can, but it doesn’t mean you should. Holes ensure proper drainage. Without holes, watering becomes a bit of a risky activity. If you have a plastic pot without holes, you can add them yourself using a drill. Materials like glass require expert attention and specialty tools, so you should avoid trying to alter those. If you prefer to use a container without drainage holes, you can add rocks, marbles, or other substrate at the bottom of the container to help with drainage, and then water the plant sparingly.</p> <h3>Q: What are the benefits of houseplants? Why are succulents so popular?</h3> <p>Houseplants are a great way to beautify rooms and bring the outdoors indoors. Some houseplants can also purify the air in your home and help increase ambient humidity. There’s also evidence that plants can improve your overall well-being and mental health by reducing stress and anxiety.</p> <p>Succulents are easy to care for and an excellent choice for neglectful gardeners who still wish to enjoy the benefits of having houseplants around. Many succulents also produce “babies” and are simple to propagate, so a single plant will eventually lead to more down the road. You don’t need to cater to unique needs like those of some tropical houseplants. Most succulents will also survive in small pots as long as they have good drainage. And, of course, they look very cool.</p>",432
612,soil for raised beds,"<p>If you still have concerns about filling your raised beds with the best soil, here are the answers to a few common questions about soil for raised beds.</p> <h3>Q: How many soil bags do I need for a raised bed?</h3> <p>It depends entirely on the size and shape of the raised bed. If you know your garden bed’s dimensions, you can plug them into a soil calculator to find out how much you need.</p> <h3>Q: How do you prepare soil for a raised bed?</h3> <p>If you’re buying potting soil in bags, it’s typically premixed, so there’s not much to do other than water it before planting. Topsoils that act as fillers require you to layer substrate and/or compost on top. Once you’ve done that, it’s all about water. Watering the soil prior to planting, using either a watering can or a garden hose, ensures your plants have enough moisture to start growing.</p> <h3>Q: Is topsoil good for a raised bed?</h3> <p>A topsoil product is a great filler, but it’s not designed to be the main nutritive soil in a raised bed. The plants need nutrients, and topsoil is not rich in organic matter like compost or potting soils.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use only compost for a raised bed?</h3> <p>Yes. In fact, the Square Foot Gardening Foundation recommends a compost-only option for gardeners on a budget or those who don’t have access to other mix-ins. However, while this can be cheaper (if you have access to free compost), the soil in a compost-only bed can become compacted.</p>",256
613,mulch,"<p>Do you still have questions about landscaping mulch? Here are some answers to frequently asked mulch questions.</p> <h3>Q. Is all mulch organic? </h3> <p>No, not all mulch is organic. Some mulches are made of inorganic materials. These synthetic mulches have their place in gardening and agriculture, though, and have many benefits. They’re easy to apply, effective, and sometimes cost less per square foot than some organic mulches, like wood chips.</p> <h3>Q. What are the types of mulch? </h3> <p>There are two main types of mulch, organic and inorganic. Here’s a full list of all the kinds of mulch you can use in your garden:</p> <ul><li>Compost</li><li>Straw</li><li>Hay</li><li>Coco coir</li><li>Shredded newspaper</li><li>Cardboard</li><li>Shredded leaves</li><li>Pine needles</li><li>Stones, pebbles, rocks</li><li>Sawdust</li><li>Crushed seashells</li><li>Grass clippings</li><li>Wood chips</li><li>Tree bark</li><li>Landscaping fabric</li><li>Black or red plastic mulch</li><li>Rubber mulch (sometimes called rubberwood chips)</li></ul> <h3>Q. What type of mulch lasts the longest? </h3> <p>Inorganic mulches are the longest lasting, which makes them good for permanent garden plants, beds, or paths. Rubber and landscaping fabric won’t break down like other types of mulch. Landscaping fabric eventually needs replacing, though, but not for years.</p> <p>The longest lasting of them all? Stones, rocks, and pebbles by far. Just know that rocks have disadvantages. They’re heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to remove if you decide to change your garden around.</p> <h3>Q. Does mulching grass make it grow faster? </h3> <p>Mulching grass can help improve the nutrient availability for your lawn and help it grow healthier. Hold on, though. Grass mulching doesn’t involve just any type of mulch. It specifically requires finely chopped-up grass clippings or an organic compost. In addition to adding nutrients, mulching your lawn can help with moisture retention, which, in turn, can help you reduce your water use and save money on your water bill.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to pull weeds before mulching? </h3> <p>You don’t need to, but it’s a good idea. You’ll get better results if you weed before applying mulch. Weeds are considered garden intruders for a reason. They’re hard to get rid of. While you might get lucky, pulling them up helps keep them from popping up again in the future. When pulling weeds, you have to get them by the taproot. Simply cutting them at the soil line won’t permanently kill them.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you remove old mulch?</h3> <p>According to lawn-care company Reddi Lawn Care, you should reapply mulch every five or six years. You might need to replace mulch sooner or add some depth for various reasons, such as if an area has heavy foot traffic.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

614,gardening shoes,"<p>Investing in a good pair of gardening shoes is a wise decision. Before making a final selection, answers to the following frequently asked questions may provide additional insight in selecting the right garden shoe.</p> <h3>Q: Are gardening boots and rain boots the same thing?</h3> <p>No, but some gardening shoes can function as rain boots, and some rain boots are suitable for gardening. Garden shoes have heavy-duty tread and are available in boot and clog styles; some are waterproof. Rain boots are typically calf-length rubber or plastic boots worn during inclement weather to keep the feet dry and warm.</p> <h3>Q: Why are clogs so popular for gardening?</h3> <p>Clogs are a popular choice for gardeners because they are comfortable, slip on and off easily, and are easy to clean.</p> <h3>Q: What are the benefits and drawbacks of overshoes for gardening? </h3> <p>Overshoes provide an inexpensive way to protect shoes from dirt and moisture in the garden. However, overshoes do not always offer traction and may not fit well over the user’s existing shoes.</p>",170
615,plant food,"<p>Check out the frequently asked questions below to answer any questions you still have about plant food, and learn more about using plant food to help your plants grow.</p> <h3>Q. What helps plants grow faster? </h3> <p>An inorganic fertilizer can help plants grow quickly. These treatments release nutrients into the soil immediately, which will help encourage plant growth. Organic fertilizers are a good option for creating healthy soil, but they don’t release nutrients into the soil as quickly and may not foster fast growth.</p> <h3>Q. Is plant food the same thing as fertilizer? </h3> <p>No, plant food is not the same as fertilizer. Plants are able to create their own food from carbon dioxide, water, and energy from the sun. Fertilizers include nutrients that can help plants stay healthy, produce chlorophyll, break down carbohydrates, grow, and so much more.</p> <h3>Q. Should I feed my plants every time I water them? </h3> <p>You don’t need to feed your plants each time you water them, but you may choose to do so. Consult your plant food’s packaging for the manufacturer’s application recommendations.</p> <h3>Q. What time of day is best to feed plants? </h3> <p>Many experts recommend feeding plants in the morning. Typically, during the morning hours there is less wind to blow away any food you’ve put in the soil. If you wait until the hottest part of the day, your plants may be stressed from the heat, which means they may not be able to absorb as many nutrients.</p> <h3>Q. How long does plant food take to work?</h3> <p>The amount of time it will take plant food to work can vary based on a few different factors. These factors include the type of plant you’re growing, the type of plant food you’re using, and the other growing conditions, such as sunlight and water.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

616,garden fork,"<p>We hope that the above information has provided you with lots of valuable information. Our top picks provide excellent examples of the best garden forks available, which should make it easier to find the one you need. During our research, a number of questions came up often. While these may have been answered above, we’ve collected them here for your convenience.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a pitchfork and a garden fork? </h3> <p>A pitchfork isn’t a digging tool but is used for lifting straw, hay, grass, etc., either loose or as bales. It can also be used for clearing manure and bedding from stables, for example. It usually has a longer handle to maximize leverage and two or three slender tines. A garden fork is shorter and normally has four tines, which are thicker and stronger for digging. Garden forks are sometimes called pitchforks, though that isn’t really correct.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a border fork and a digging fork? </h3> <p>A digging fork is a general-purpose tool. A border fork is a smaller, lighter version that is easier to use if space is restricted, which is often the case in a border filled with flowers and shrubs.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a garden fork? </h3> <p>Consider how often you will use the garden fork, typical tasks you might need to complete, and budget. You also might want to look at length and weight, especially if physicality, ergonomics, or height are issues.</p> <h3>Q: How do you rotate soil with a garden fork? </h3> <p>Push the tines in with your foot, pull the handle back to lever the soil loose, and then break up clumps by striking them with the back of the fork. If the soil is compacted or heavy clay, attempting to move too much could strain your back. Work 6 inches of soil at a time.</p> <h3>Q: Should you oil a garden fork?</h3> <p>Boiled linseed oil rubbed into wooden fork handles with a rag will feed the wood and shed water so the handles last longer. Wiping a little of the oil over metal parts will help to prevent rust. Though not as good for the wood, light machine oil could also be used.</p> <h3>Q: Can you sharpen a garden fork? </h3> <p>Unlike a garden spade, which can benefit from periodic sharpening, there is seldom a need to sharpen a garden fork. Sharp tines do make working soil easier, but they are usually very durable and wear very little. If you feel the need to sharpen a garden fork, a file or handheld grindstone will do the job.</p>",430
617,led grow lights,"<p>For readers who still have questions about LED plant lights, here are some answers to some commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Which lights do professional growers use? </h3> <p>Cheap LED grow lights for vegetables won’t perform at the same level as those used by professional growers. Professionals generally use high-intensity discharge lamps (HID) or fluorescents, though the industry is shifting to favor LEDs. Because of their energy efficiency, LEDs are a better choice for home use.</p> <h3>Q: How many watts per plant do I need?</h3> <p>When comparing the power of various grow lights, look at the “actual power draw” or “actual power consumption” in watts. Generally speaking, grow lights should use 32 watts per square foot of grow space at the absolute minimum, though 50 to 80 watts per square foot is ideal.</p> <p>The actual brightness of LED lights is measured in lumens rather than watts, which is another way of measuring light intensity. Vegetables typically require 2,200 lumens per square foot, while other plants generally need approximately 1,375 lumens per square foot.</p> <h3>Q: How far should LED lights be from plants?</h3> <p>LED lights should generally be at least 12 inches above your plants to prevent leaf burn.</p> <h3>Q: What advantages do LED grow lights have over HPS lights? </h3> <p>LED grow lights are more energy efficient than high-pressure sodium (or HPS) lights. They also emit less heat, which means you don’t have to worry as much about temperature regulation.</p>",237
618,humidifier for plants,"<p><span>When using a humidifier to optimize your home’s humidity level for keeping your indoor plants thriving in every season, here are a few answers to some common questions about humidifier use to get you on your way.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: What kind of humidifier is best for plants?</b></h3> <p><span>The best humidifier depends on several factors, including the size of the room, typical ambient conditions, and the amount and duration of humidity required by the plant species.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: Do humidifiers cause mold?</b></h3> <p><span>When not properly maintained and cleaned, a humidifier can grow mold in the water tank and on the filter. The mold can then be dispersed into the environment with mist, triggering a variety of respiratory issues, from allergies to asthma.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: Is warm mist or cool mist better for plants?</b></h3> <p><span>You can use both warm- and cool-mist humidifiers with indoor plants. The biggest difference between the two is that cool-mist humidifiers use a filter system, which is more energy-friendly than the evaporation method of warm-mist humidifiers.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: What is the best humidifier placement for plants?</b></h3> <p><span>Keeping your humidifier about 6 feet from your plants will ensure they receive adequate moisture. However, it’s advised to not keep them any closer than that distance to avoid accumulation of excess moisture on the plants’ leaves, which could give way to fungus and mold growth.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: How often should I use a humidifier for my plants?</b></h3> <p><span>When it comes to the frequency at which you should be running your humidifier, follow your plants’ cue. Wilty leaves with brown tips can indicate that your plants are not receiving enough moisture. Stunted growth and blossoms prematurely dropping also can indicate low humidity.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: How long should I run my humidifier for plants?</b></h3> <p><span>How often you need to run your humidifier depends largely on the types of plants you have and the season. Tropical plants require a longer duration to supply sufficient moisture, while succulents require less.</span></p>",319
619,rain gauge,"<p>There may still be a few lingering questions about rain gauges, so the following will help. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about buying and using a rain gauge.</p> <h3>Q. How does a rain gauge work?</h3> <p>A rain gauge collects water into a graduated cylinder and measures precipitation over time. Analog types require users to record measurements manually and dump the water themselves.</p> <p>Digital models require less maintenance; they record and transmit data to an indoor unit or to an app, and often include a self-draining feature.</p> <h3>Q. What size should a rain gauge be?</h3> <p>If you are a gardener, a 5- or 6-inch capacity will likely suffice. If you live in a rainy climate or make a livelihood from farming, a cylinder capable of collecting between 7 and 11 inches of water is probably more suitable.</p> <h3>Q. Where is the best place for a rain gauge?</h3> <p>The best spot for a rain gauge is one that is free of obstructions, protected from the wind, and 5 feet above the ground. For accurate measurements, a level surface is also ideal.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to mount a rain gauge?</h3> <p>Many rain gauges come with mounting brackets, for which you’ll need screws. They can then be mounted on fence posts, patio railings, or other elevated spots. Some models include spikes to secure them directly in the ground.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I check my rain gauge?</h3> <p>An analog gauge will require you to record measurements yourself. How often you check it depends on the accuracy and precision required. Digital or wireless gauges, on the other hand, record the data for you. You only need to check them for battery changes or occasional repairs.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean a rain gauge?</h3> <p>When your rain gauge develops buildup, use gentle soap to clean it. The funnel and cylinders are sometimes removable for ease of cleaning. Steer clear of harsh chemicals, which may damage the glass or plastic. Always read the manufacturer’s directions before cleaning.</p>",339
620,soil moisture meter,"<p>Aid your green thumb with a soil moisture meter. These handheld devices are a small but useful tool for gardeners, providing a tangible measure of soil moisture levels. The following answers to some frequently asked questions may further help shoppers choose the best soil moisture meter.</p> <h3>Q. Are soil moisture meters accurate?</h3> <p>Yes, a soil moisture meter provides a numerical measure, which is more sensitive than the touch-and-feel method many gardeners use. Most inexpensive analog meters provide a measure on a 1-to-10 scale, which is accurate enough for the average gardener. For an even more accurate reading, consider a digital moisture meter that provides a reading to the nearest decimal point or shows a percentage.</p> <h3>Q. What should your soil moisture be?</h3> <p>The ideal soil moisture level depends on the type of plant being grown. Some plants thrive with very little moisture (as low as 1 or 2 on a 10-point scale), while others prefer very moist soil (8 or higher).</p> <h3>Q. Can I leave my moisture meter in the soil?</h3> <p>It depends on the model, but most meters on the market should not be left in the soil. Although moisture meters are made to withstand some wear and tear, leaving the device in the soil can cause it to rust and degrade. Unless otherwise specified, it is best to clean and store a moisture meter after each use. If leaving it in the soil is an important feature for your garden, look for one specifically designed to stay in place.</p> <h3>Q. Should you water plants every day?</h3> <p>That depends on whether they’re indoors or outdoors, as well as temperature and humidity levels. In general, indoor plants need 1 inch of water per week. Outdoor potted plants in sunny, hot conditions may need to be watered daily to stay healthy.</p>",300
621,indoor garden,"<p>Take good care of your indoor garden and it will likely reward you with some beautiful and healthy plants in any season. If you aren’t sure you’re maintaining an indoor garden correctly or want other information, read on for answers to some common questions about these products so you can enjoy fresh herbs, flowers, and veggies throughout the year.</p> <h3>Q. What plants can be grown indoors?</h3> <p>You can grow many plants indoors, but most indoor gardens are best suited to growing herbs or small flowers.</p> <h3>Q. What plants can grow in a hydroponic system?</h3> <p>As long as they have the proper nutrients and adequate space, virtually any plant can grow in a hydroponic system. The size of the plant is a determiner here—smaller plants, such as herbs, are better suited to most indoor gardens than are larger vegetable plants.</p> <h3>Q. How often do you feed hydroponic plants?</h3> <p>A general rule is to add water every 2 weeks, but follow the instructions supplied with your indoor garden to determine how much and how often to feed.</p> <h3>Q. How do I set up an indoor aquaponics system?</h3> <p>Fill the tank with filtered water and add water treatment, which should be included, to make the water suitable for aquatic life. Then add the fish to the tank, and attach the pump that comes with the system to keep the water oxygenated for the fish. Once the fish are established, sow microgreen seeds in the trays above the tank. The pump will keep the seeds damp and promote sprouting.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to change the water in an aquaponics system?</h3> <p>If your system is healthy, you won’t need to change the water very often. If it gets murky, however, change it with fresh water and then treat the water before putting the fish back in.</p>",302
622,planters,"<p>The best planters for your home are pretty and practical to elevate your decor and keep plants thriving. Beyond a stylish look, they should also be suitable for the plant and your intended use. If you’re still searching for the perfect planter to house your greenery, explore the frequently asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q. What plants grow in small pots?</h3> <p>Plenty of plants can grow in small pots, including ferns, succulents, aloe vera, air plants, and many herbs.</p> <h3>Q. What large plants do well in pots?</h3> <p>Fiddle leaf figs, bamboo, monsteras, rubber plants, and money trees can thrive in large indoor planters and make a statement in your home.</p> <h3>Q. What plants are good for hanging planters?</h3> <p>Spider plants, English ivy, string of pearls, and pothos plants have a pretty draping effect that looks lovely in hanging planters.</p> <h3>Q. What plants work best in a terrarium?</h3> <p>Slow-growing, low-maintenance succulents, ferns, air plants, and some carnivorous plants do well in terrariums.</p> <h3>Q. Are self-watering pots good for all plants?</h3> <p>No, self-watering pots are not suitable for plants that require dry soil between waterings.</p> <h3>Q. Which pots are best for outdoor plants?</h3> <p>For outdoor plants, choose a pot that is durable and heavy enough to withstand windy, rainy, and cold weather.</p>",208
623,garden trowel,"<p>After purchasing the best garden trowel, you might have questions about how to use and care for it to ensure the tool lasts a long time. Keep reading to find some frequently asked questions and answers about trowels.</p> <h3>Q. What is a trowel for gardening?</h3> <p>A garden trowel is like a handheld shovel or spade that’s used for potting, planting, transplanting, weeding, digging, and more.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a trowel and a transplanter?</h3> <p>While very similar to a trowel, a transplanter has a longer, narrower blade for precise digging under plant roots for digging up and moving the plant to other locations.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a garden trowel?</h3> <p>Trowels are used primarily for digging, such as when planting, transplanting, or weeding. Insert the tip of the blade into the soil of a garden bed or pot and scoop it out. For transplanting, the trowel needs to dig deeply enough to lift out the plant and its roots.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a garden trowel last?</h3> <p>Quality garden trowels can last a decade or longer with proper care. To ensure a longer life, clean, sanitize, and wipe the blades dry after each use. Also remember to store the trowel safely out of the elements.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

624,grow bag,"<p>While shopping for the best grow bags for your garden, you may have questions about what you can and cannot do with these garden marvels. Some of the most frequently-asked questions about grow bags appear below.</p> <h3>Q. Are grow bags suitable for all kinds of plants?</h3> <p>Unfortunately, no. Most grow bags aren’t suitable for plants like pumpkins, okra, and winter squash, all of which need a lot of root space.</p> <h3>Q. What can I grow in 3-gallon grow bags?</h3> <p>Plants with shallow roots—such as peppers, lettuce, cucumbers, peas, radishes, and some herbs—can be grown successfully in 3-gallon grow bags.</p> <h3>Q. What do you put under grow bags?</h3> <p>If your grow bags are being used outside, they may not need anything under them. However, if they’re inside or on a deck, place a saucer or plate underneath to catch the moisture that seeps through the fabric. Some gardeners put their grow bags on cinder blocks or wood stilts for better drainage.</p> <h3>Q. Do you need drainage holes in grow bags?</h3> <p>No, most grow bags drain properly, although you may need to move the grow bag to prevent moisture from building up around the base.</p> <h3>Q. How long do grow bags last?</h3> <p>With the right care, most grow bags can last for years.</p>",211
625,weed torch,"<p>If you still have some questions about buying or using the best weed torches, this section is for you. The following is a collection of answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about weed torches.</p> <h3>Q: How does a weed torch work?</h3> <p>Weed torches use propane-fueled flames to cook the cells inside of a weed, inhibiting its ability to use sunlight (or photosynthesis) for energy and growth.</p> <h3>Q: How hot do weed torches get?</h3> <p>Weed burners vary in their heat output, with some models producing more than others. Common torches range between 20,000 and 500,000 BTUs.</p> <h3>Q: Can a weed torch help with poison ivy?</h3> <p>Burning poison ivy is a bad idea. The oil in poison ivy, oak, or sumac that causes itchy blisters is called urushiol. If you burn these plants, the oil attaches itself to the smoke particles, which can land in your lungs and cause serious respiratory irritation.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need to reduce the weed to ash or simply brown it to destroy it?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, burning the weeds to charred ash isn’t necessary. Simply heating the plant for a few seconds until it wilts and browns should be enough to destroy it.</p> <h3>Q: How do you start a weed burner?</h3> <p>Starting a weed burner is typically very easy. Start by attaching the propane to the wand, or the hose to the propane tank, depending on the model. Next, open the valve on the propane tank, if it has one. Then open the valve on the wand to let some gas pass through. Finally, press the built-in igniter or use a striker held (safely) near the nozzle while striking to light the weed torch.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

626,organic fertilizer,"<p>If you’re just starting out with organic fertilizer, you may have a few concerns. Below, we’ve answered some of the most frequently asked questions about buying and using these products.</p> <h3>Q. What are the types of organic fertilizer?</h3> <p>Organic fertilizer ingredients vary widely but can be categorized as plant-based, animal-based, and mineral. Most organic fertilizers contain a combination of these types to provide a balance of essential macro and micronutrients, plus beneficial microbes that help make the nutrients available. Dry or granular fertilizers feed all season, while liquids provide a quick burst of nutrients.</p> <h3>Q. How can you tell if fertilizer is organic?</h3> <p>The easiest way to tell if fertilizer is organic is to check the label. Organic fertilizer companies work hard to be certified organic and typically include the word “organic” in the product name. Also, on the back of the package, you’ll find the ingredients list.</p> <p>Organic ingredients are the by-products of plant and animal processing, including alfalfa meal, soybean meal, cottonseed meal, blood meal, bone meal, feather meal, composted manure, and others. Organic fertilizer does not include ammonium nitrate, superphosphate, potassium sulfate, or other synthetic ingredients.</p> <h3>Q. What type of nutrient is the most important for the plants?</h3> <p>The most volatile and most commonly lacking nutrient in soil is nitrogen, as it quickly turns into a gas and is released into the atmosphere. Other nutrients may persist in the soil for longer periods of time. However, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are all needed in such quantities that they are considered macronutrients that must be replenished for healthy plant growth.</p> <h3>Q. How do you apply organic fertilizer to plants?</h3> <p>Apply organic fertilizer to the soil around the plants. Beneficial microbes within the soil release the nutrients from the fertilizer, making them available for plants to use.</p> <h3>Q. Can you over-fertilize your plants with organic fertilizers?</h3> <p>Yes. Although many organic fertilizers are promoted as non-burning, other problems can arise from excess nutrient loads, including insect and disease infestations. Ideally, follow fertilizer recommendations based on soil sample results. In the absence of a soil sample, follow the directions on the fertilizer label.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

627,indoor succulents,"<p>From how to take care of your succulent to how long it might live, read on for answers to the most frequently asked questions about indoor succulents.</p> <h3>Q. What soil is best for succulents?</h3> <p>Well-draining soil, such as a sandy or even gravelly mix, is best for succulents. If you can, purchase a cactus soil for your succulents.</p> <h3>Q. How much light do succulents need?</h3> <p>Succulents need about six hours of indirect sunlight a day—they can scorch in direct sun. You also can rotate succulents to ensure all sides are getting enough light.</p> <h3>Q. How do I care for succulents in winter?</h3> <p>Depending on humidity level, succulents might need more or less water in the winter, though generally they need less. Succulents still need adequate light during the winter.</p> <h3>Q. Can succulents stay in small pots?</h3> <p>It depends on the variety. Some succulents grow very little and prefer small pots. Others, while they can stay small, might outgrow their pots.</p> <h3>Q. Do succulents attract bugs?</h3> <p>Unless you overwater your succulent, bugs generally aren’t an issue (bugs can be attracted to moist soil), but some succulents attract mealybugs.</p> <h3>Q. How long do succulents live?</h3> <p>It depends on the particular succulent and how well you take care of it, but some succulents can live anywhere from a few years to a few decades.</p>",221
628,garden fence,"<p>Here are answers to some common questions about garden fences.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most durable fence?</h3> <p>The most durable garden fences are made from vinyl or powder-coated steel.</p> <h3>Q. How high should a fence be for a vegetable garden?</h3> <p>The height of a fence around a vegetable garden varies depending on what kind of animal needs to be kept out. Fences to deter deer, for example, should be 8 feet high, while fences that are 2 feet tall are sufficient to deter rabbits.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain a garden fence?</h3> <p>Garden fences made of PVC, vinyl, or powder-coated steel are very low maintenance and don’t require any regular upkeep. Wood fences typically need to be power-washed and restained periodically.</p>",121
629,heated bird bath,"<p>Now that you know how to select the best heated bird bath, it’s time to answer any remaining questions you might have about these products. Below is more valuable information about how to properly care for a heated bird bath and attract more local birds to it.</p> <h3>Q. How do you attract birds to a heated bird bath? </h3> <p>Make sure it’s visible in a good, sunny location, and keep the water clean.</p> <h3>Q. How do you heat a bird bath in the winter? </h3> <p>Invest in a heated bird bath if you’d like to provide avian friends with water during the winter. If you already have a regular bird bath, purchase a heating element such as a deicer to heat frigid water.</p> <h3>Q. Should I put rocks in my bird bath? </h3> <p>Yes, putting rocks in your bird bath can make it easier for birds to stand while bathing.</p> <h3>Q. Why won’t birds come to my bird bath? </h3> <p>If birds are not coming to your bird bath, it’s possible that your water isn’t fresh or the bird bath isn’t clean. Give your basin a good scrub with a 9:1 ratio of water to vinegar and refill it with fresh water.</p>",198
630,fertilizer for peppers,"<p>Fertilizers add vital nutrients to the soil and encourage high vegetable production. Still, new gardeners likely have some questions about which type of fertilizer to use and how often to apply it.</p> <h3>Q. When should I fertilizer my peppers?</h3> <p>This varies by the specific fertilizer; in general, fertilizer can be added at transplant time and then every few weeks afterward throughout the growing season.</p> <h3>Q. What nutrients do pepper plants need?</h3> <p>Peppers, like tomatoes and other veggies, require nitrogen for robust plant growth, phosphorus for increasing the plant’s ability to store energy, and potassium to help the plant resist disease. Depending on the soil content, peppers also might need a fertilizer that contains calcium, magnesium, or iron.</p> <h3>Q. Can you overfertilize pepper plants?</h3> <p>For the best results, carefully follow the feeding instructions on the package. While peppers thrive with fertilizer, mixing it into too strong a formula can burn leaves if applied to foliage, and feeding too often can lead to yellowing of the lower leaves, dropped leaves, and slow growth.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

633,soil for roses,"<p>Once you’ve found the best soil for growing roses indoors, it’s time to start planting. But first, check out some of the most frequently asked questions about potting soil for indoor roses.</p> <h3><b>Q. What type of soil does a rose grow best in?</b></h3> <p>Roses thrive in soil that drains well and is properly aerated, which makes ingredients such as coir and peat moss useful.</p> <h3><b>Q. How do I make soil acidic for roses?</b></h3> <p>Adding compost to soil is an excellent way to make it more acidic for roses. It’ll also help provide roses with more of the nutrients they need to flourish.</p> <h3><b>Q. Do roses like acidic or alkaline soil?</b></h3> <p>Roses prefer soil with a pH of around 6.5, which is slightly acidic but close to neutral soil.</p> <h3><b>Q. Why is my indoor rose plant dying?</b></h3> <p>There could be several reasons. It may not be receiving enough light; indoor roses need about six hours of full sun each day. You may be watering it too much or too little. Another possibility is that you may need to repot the plant to ensure the soil still contains enough nutrients—annual repotting is recommended by some soil manufacturers.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

634,citrus fertilizer,"<p>Fresh oranges, limes, and grapefruits are the essence of summer. When gardeners fertilize citrus trees, they will see larger harvests and healthier trees. Those new to growing citrus fruits are likely to have some questions.</p> <h3>Q: Do citrus trees need special fertilizer?</h3> <p>The majority of citrus trees will do well with an all-purpose citrus fertilizer. Still, depending on the existing soil’s nutrient composition, the fertilizer may need more of one nutrient than another. The safest bet is to have the soil tested and then purchase a fertilizer that supplies the missing nutrients.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best time to fertilize citrus trees? </h3> <p>Newly transplanted trees may not need fertilizing for two years, while established citrus trees may require feeding every few weeks, starting in early spring. The best timing for fertilizing also depends on the product used to fertilize the trees.</p> <h3>Q: How do you fertilize citrus trees?</h3> <p>Various products are applied differently, so follow package directions carefully. In general, liquid fertilizers are either sprayed on the tree’s foliage or poured beneath the tree, while granular fertilizers may be sprinkled under the tree and then worked into the soil. Fertilizer spikes are inserted in the soil of potted trees or driven into the soil around in-ground trees.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

635,brush killer,"<p>Unwanted vines and brush can take over a plot of land quickly. When they become too thick and tough to remove with a mower or brush cutter, many homeowners opt to use chemical weed and brush killer products. Here are answers to some common questions about brush killers.</p> <h3>Q. Can a brush killer kill grass or other desirable plants?</h3> <p>Yes, herbicides kill a wide range of plants, and overspray can kill desirable plants. So use caution and don’t apply herbicide when it’s windy.</p> <h3>Q. Are brush killers safe for children or pets?</h3> <p>Some are safer than others. Always read and follow the label’s safety precautions, and don’t allow children or pets in the area until the recommended amount of time has passed.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take for a brush killer to work?</h3> <p>When foliage is saturated, many brush killers start working almost immediately. Still, it can take time for the herbicide to travel from the leaves through the stems, trunks, and roots. Wilting may be evident in 24 hours, but the entire plant may not die for up to six weeks.</p> <h3>Q. How many times do I have to apply the brush killer?</h3> <p>Most of the time it only takes one application, but success depends on several factors. If the wrong type of product is used, it may never kill the offending brush; if rain washes the herbicide off too soon, reapplication may be necessary. Always read the product’s label, because it may be a violation of federal law to reapply specific herbicides before a certain amount of time (specified on the label) has passed.</p>",267
636,dandelion killer,"<p>Broadleaf herbicides can help keep a lawn free from dandelions, but you may have some questions about whether the products are safe for yards, humans, pets, and the environment.</p> <p>The best dandelion killer is one that fits your family’s lifestyle while helping keep the lawn weed-free. Below are answers to some of the most popular questions about dandelion killers.</p> <h3>Q. Why should I remove dandelions from my lawn?</h3> <p>Dandelions won’t harm the soil; in fact, their deep roots can help prevent erosion on sloped areas. However, a few dandelions this summer can turn into hundreds next summer. Because they detract from the look of a lush lawn and they spread so quickly, the best way to keep them out of a lawn is to get rid of them when they first appear.</p> <h3>Q. Are dandelion killers safe? </h3> <p>It depends on the product. Natural and organic herbicides are safe for the environment, but they may still pose health risks to pets and humans. Chemical herbicides also may pose health risks during application and until the chemicals are absorbed in the soil. The verdict is still out as to whether chemical herbicides pose a substantial risk to the environment when used as directed, but to minimize risk, use them with caution.</p> <h3>Q. How do I kill dandelions but not the grass in my garden? </h3> <p>The best method is to use a selective broadleaf herbicide that will kill the dandelions but will not harm the lawn. Read the product’s label before applying it to ensure it’s safe for specific species of grass.</p>",259
637,solar post cap lights,"<p>Before investing in a new solar post cap light, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers to learn more about how solar lights function and how long they will last before needing to be replaced.</p> <h3>Q. Do solar post lights work if it’s cloudy all day?</h3> <p>While direct sunlight is the best way to quickly charge a solar post cap light, indirect daylight, even when it’s cloudy, will also charge the solar battery, just not at the same speed.</p> <h3>Q. Do solar post lights come with batteries?</h3> <p>While you won’t have to worry about regularly replacing disposable batteries, a solar post light still comes with one or more rechargeable batteries inside.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a solar post cap light last?</h3> <p>A solar post cap light can last between 2 and 8 years, depending on the frequency of use, the replaceability of the battery, and whether it’s somewhat sheltered or completely exposed to any and all weather conditions.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

However, they don’t eat birdseed, so attracting them requires putting out jelly, nectar, or fresh oranges. Keep reading to find commonly asked questions and their answers.</p> <h3>Q. How do I attract orioles to my yard?</h3> <p>Orioles have a sweet tooth, so offer grape jelly, nectar, or fresh fruit to lure them to a feeder. Planting orange-flowering bushes and vines also helps draw their attention.</p> <h3>Q. What time of day do orioles feed?</h3> <p>They can eat any time of day if food is available, but migrating orioles feed most heavily in the mornings.</p> <h3>Q. Where is the best place to put an oriole feeder?</h3> <p>Orioles prefer staying close to trees and shrubbery, so place an oriole feeder near trees when possible, and out of the direct sun.</p> <h3>Q. How high off the ground should an oriole feeder be?</h3> <p>Try to position an oriole feeder at least 7 feet high. Orioles are high-tree birds who prefer to stay in the upper branches, so they might avoid visiting lower feeders.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

639,pond pump,"<p>With so many different types and sizes of pond pumps to choose from, it’s natural to have a few remaining questions about selecting the right one and what to expect.</p> <h3>Q: How big of a pond pump do I need?</h3> <p>In general, select a pump with a gallons-per-hour (GPH) pumping capacity that equals half the pond’s gallon capacity. For example, for a 4,000-gallon pond, choose a 2,000-GPH pump.</p> <h3>Q: Should a pond pump be on all the time?</h3> <p>It depends on the pump. Some can operate continuously, while others may overheat and should run for only a few hours at a time. Check the owner’s manual for specifics.</p> <h3>Q: Does a pond pump use a lot of electricity?</h3> <p>The larger the pump, the more electricity it will use. Many pumps list the amount of wattage they use per hour. Multiply that by the number of hours per day the pump will likely run, and then multiply that number by 30 for a per-month wattage estimate. To estimate how much the pump will add to the electricity bill, multiply the final number by the cost of electricity (per watt) from your utility bill.</p> <h3>Q: How long do pond pumps last?</h3> <p>The pump’s quality is a factor, but, in general, expect a submersible pond pump to last 3 to 5 years.</p>",219
640,slug killer,"<p>Read on to find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about slug killers and how to use them to keep pests out of your yard and garden.</p> <h3>Q: Are slug killers safe around my pets and children?</h3> <p>Any pest-killing product should be kept away from kids and pets. Even if the active ingredient won’t cause significant harm, these are toxins designed to kill; in high enough quantities, slug killers have been known to be fatal to small pets.</p> <p>Metaldehyde slug killers are the most dangerous type. Although sodium ferric EDTA and iron phosphate slug killers shouldn’t be ingested or handled, it’s less likely they will cause lasting harm.</p> <h3>Q: How do I apply slug and snail killer?</h3> <p>Applying slug and snail killer to the garden is an effective way to get rid of slugs. And it’s a quick process that isn’t difficult for DIYers to handle on their own. Follow these simple steps to treat your garden.</p> <ol><li>Before doing anything else, read the instructions on the product packaging, as well as the manufacturer’s recommendations for use, to ensure that you follow all safety requirements.</li><li>Water the garden beforehand, especially if it hasn’t rained for a few days and the ground is very dry.</li><li>Sprinkle an even layer of pellets from the box to create a perimeter around the garden. If you are using a liquid slug killer, you will follow the same process, except you will be spraying the solution. Keep in mind, you want to sprinkle or spray as close to the ground as possible to avoid getting the slug killer on the leaves of the plants.</li><li>After surrounding the garden, apply additional bait to particularly moist areas of the garden where water tends to pool.</li><li>Leave the garden for 24 hours, then check back the next day. Remove all visible snails, as they can continue to lay eggs even when they are paralyzed by the slug killer.</li><li>Repeat these steps as necessary.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How often should I put down slug pellets?</h3> <p>Slug pellets are only needed when there is an active slug problem in your garden. During an infestation, pellets should be applied once every 30 to 40 days in order to keep out slugs.</p> <h3>Q: Will slug pellets kill rats?</h3> <p>It depends on the type of slug pellets and how much the rat consumes. If they chow down on enough metaldehyde slug killer, then they will eventually die, but it won’t happen quickly since this pest killer isn’t designed for mammals.</p> <p>Sodium ferric EDTA and iron phosphate products are even less effective against rats, so if you have a real rat problem, invest in rat traps or rat poisons.</p>",440
641,bird feeders for cardinals,"<p>Still have questions about choosing the best bird feeder for attracting cardinals? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions, with answers to help you get started.</p> <h3>Q: Do cardinals need special feeders?</h3> <p>No, but since they don’t like to twist their bodies while eating, any feeder that has plenty of space and allows them to face forward when eating can work.</p> <h3>Q: What attracts cardinals to feeders?</h3> <p>Cardinals are attracted to feeders that have their favorite foods, such as sunflower and safflower seeds, peanuts, and even cracked corn. Suet is a popular type of food for cardinals in the wintertime.</p> <h3>Q: Will bird feeders for cardinals attract other birds as well?</h3> <p>Yes!

642,fertilizers for hydrangeas,"<p>Hydrangeas grow in most regions of the country and are prized for their spectacular blooms, so it’s natural to have a few questions about how to make the most of these eye-catching shrubs.</p> <h3>Q: When do hydrangeas start to bloom?</h3> <p>In warm climates, hydrangeas start to bloom in early summer. In northern climes, they bloom in mid-summer.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best time to fertilize hydrangeas? </h3> <p>It depends on the type of fertilizer. It’s a good idea to give hydrangeas a first feeding in mid-to-late spring. After that, apply additional fertilizer at intervals recommended by the manufacturer. Time-released fertilizers might need to be applied only once every 3 months, while other types should be applied every 1 to 2 weeks.</p> <h3>Q: How do I fertilize hydrangeas?</h3> <p>It’s essential to follow the directions on the product label. Liquids can be diluted and poured around the plant’s base or sprinkled on the foliage, while granules are often worked into the top inch or so of the soil. Fertilizer spikes are inserted near the base of the plant and pushed beneath the soil’s surface.</p>",181
643,fertilizer for st augustine grass,"<p>St. Augustine lawns are typical in warm coastal states but will grow anywhere in USDA zones 8 through 10. For a healthy, uniformly colored lawn, apply a good turf fertilizer regularly. Those who are new to growing St. Augustine grass will likely have some questions.</p> <h3>Q: When should St. Augustine grass be fertilized?</h3> <p>The first feeding in the spring should take place a week or two after the grass has entirely greened up. After that the frequency with which you apply fertilizer depends on the product’s strength, so follow package directions. In general, every 4 to 6 weeks is usually sufficient.</p> <h3>Q: Is it possible to overfertilize St. Augustine grass?</h3> <p>Applying fertilizer at a rate that exceeds the recommended rate, or applying it more often than is recommended, can result in faster grass blade growth but not necessarily healthier grass. It will, however, result in more frequent mowing.</p> <h3>Q: How is fertilizer applied to a lawn?</h3> <p>The most efficient way to distribute fertilizer is to use a pump-type sprayer for liquids, and a spreader to apply granulated products. For water-soluble fertilizer, use a hose-end dispenser.</p> <h3>Q: Can fertilizer be applied to wet grass?</h3> <p>Yes. The caveat here is to wait until after heavy rain if water is still running off the lawn, which could result in the fertilizer washing away.</p> <h3>Q: Should turf or sod be watered after fertilizing?</h3> <p>When applying a liquid fertilizer—no.

644,greenhouse plastic,"<p>Having a greenhouse opens a world of growing possibilities that aren’t available inside a typical home with limited windows and space to start seeds and care for plants. Growers wanting to produce healthy vegetables or grow flowers in a greenhouse will likely have some questions about the types of greenhouse plastic available.</p> <h3>Q. Does greenhouse plastic block UV rays?</h3> <p>If the plastic has been treated with UV blockers, then it will reduce harmful UV rays.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between clear vs. white greenhouse plastic?</h3> <p>Clear plastic lets in more direct sunlight than white greenhouse plastic. Most plastics are somewhere between crystal clear and white, with many featuring just a touch of opaqueness.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use regular plastic for the greenhouse?</h3> <p>The best plastic for greenhouses is “greenhouse plastic” or “agricultural plastic.” Regular plastic sheeting, known as “utility plastic,” may not hold up to the elements as well, but it will still offer a measure of protection.</p> <h3>Q. How do you install greenhouse plastic?</h3> <p>For the easiest installation, drape plastic film over the greenhouse frame and attach it with furring strips. Rigid plastic panels are typically screwed directly into the greenhouse frame.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean greenhouse plastic?</h3> <p>If the plastic becomes dusty or dirty, a light misting with a garden hose will usually rinse away dirt. To remove heavy accumulations, add a few drops of dish soap to warm water, wipe down the plastic, and thoroughly rinse. Avoid using a pressure washer that could tear plastic film.</p> <h3>Q. How long do polycarbonate greenhouses last?</h3> <p>Among the longest lasting of all greenhouse plastics, rigid polycarbonate plastic panels can last up to 10 years before requiring replacement.</p>",279
645,nest box,"<p>If you are in the process of choosing which nest box best suits your flock of chickens, making a decision is easier with as much information as possible. Before selecting the new nest box, check out the following answers to some frequently asked questions about nest boxes and their optimal sizes.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best material for a nest box?</h3> <p>Nonporous materials like plastic and metal are easier to clean and tend to be longer lasting.</p> <h3>Q. Do nest boxes need to be in the coop?</h3> <p>Ideally, yes, nest boxes need to be in the coop. Placing them away from the coop can be problematic for chickens and may encourage them to lay eggs elsewhere.</p> <h3>Q. How high should chicken nest boxes be?</h3> <p>Mount nest boxes 2 to 4 feet off the ground to make egg collection and cleaning easier. For chickens that don’t fly well, closer to the ground is better, unless you build them a ramp to get to the nest box.</p> <h3>Q. How many nest boxes do I need for 4 chickens?</h3> <p>Using the rule of four to five chickens per box, one box is usually sufficient.</p> <h3>Q. How many nest boxes do I need for 6 chickens?</h3> <p>Two boxes should be fine for six chickens. However, chickens may show a preference for one box over another.</p> <h3>Q. How many nest boxes do I need for 10 chickens?</h3> <p>Two or three boxes usually works well to accommodate 10 chickens. Territorial chickens may not be as inclined to share, so three boxes may be better.</p>",258
646,soil for monstera,"<p>A Monstera plant makes a striking addition as a houseplant or on the patio, with its large attractive leaves—but it’s a little picky about its preferred soil. Some questions are to be expected from those looking to find an optimal soil to grow this tropical beauty, and the answers are below.</p> <h3>Q: Is Monstera a good indoor plant?</h3> <p>When it comes to tropical plants, Monstera is a relatively easy keeper that will withstand even occasional dry soil, making it a great choice for many indoor situations.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best soil mix for Monstera?</h3> <p>The inclusion of one or more of the following ingredients: peat moss, pine fines, coco coir, perlite, and vermiculite are often found in an optimal growing medium.</p> <h3>Q: How much light does a Monstera need?</h3> <p>Monstera likes ample indirect light, such as being near a northern window. Avoid placing it in a hot, sunny window, which could cause the leaves to wilt.</p> <h3>Q: How much water does a Monstera need?</h3> <p>Monstera should be watered thoroughly—until water begins running out the pot’s drain holes—every 10 to 14 days. Don’t overwater.</p> <h3>Q: When should a Monstera plant be repotted?</h3> <p>Monsteras may need repotting as often as every 2 years if they’re quick growing. When the soil doesn’t hold as much water as it once did (you’ll notice that more runs out of the drain holes), or if a root grows out a drain hole, consider repotting to a larger container.</p> <h3>Q: What causes a Monstera plant to droop after repotting?</h3> <p>Repotting is naturally stressful to the plant, and some growers tend to overwater after repotting, which can exacerbate the problem. Make sure the plant is not in direct light and don’t water too much. In a few weeks, it should perk back up.</p>",296
647,seed starting mix,"<p>By using a seed-starting mix, you increase the chance of successfully growing plants to transplant to the garden later. Frequently asked questions about seed starter mixes appear below.</p> <h3>Q: Which type of soil is best for starting seeds?</h3> <p>None, actually! Avoid planting seeds in natural soil; instead, opt for a commercial seed-starting mix for optimal germination and survival rates.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between potting soil and seed-starting mix?</h3> <p>Potting soil is denser and may contain larger bits of ingredients, such as twigs or clumps. Seed-starting mix is very fine and contains no large pieces.</p> <h3>Q: Can you reuse seed-starting mix?</h3> <p>No, once it’s been used, it’s no longer sterile. But you can sprinkle leftover mix on the garden or blend it into a potted plant to help lighten the soil.</p> <h3>Q: Does seed-starting mix expire?</h3> <p>No. Seed starting mixes don’t have expiration dates.</p>",145
648,grub killer,"<p>Get to know more about reducing and killing grubs by checking out some of the most frequently asked questions about grub killers below.</p> <h3>Q: Do grub control products also kill bugs?</h3> <p>The active ingredients in many synthetic grub control products kill other bugs as well. Each product is slightly different, so be sure to read the label to avoid unwanted collateral damage and control additional bugs.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use grub killer in flower beds?</h3> <p>Yes, but avoid broad-spectrum sprays that will harm pollinators and helpful insects. For this reason, flower and vegetable gardens are ideal locations to apply beneficial nematodes or milky spore.</p> <h3>Q: Can I seed grass after applying my grub killer?</h3> <p>Yes. The active ingredients in grub killer are safe to use with new lawns, whether seeded or sodded.</p> <h3>Q: How long does it take to kill grubs?</h3> <p>Some products begin killing grubs in as little as 24 hours.</p>",152
649,black mulch,"<p>Still not sure about which black mulch product is right for your landscaping project? Take a look at some of the most commonly asked questions about mulch.</p> <h3>Q. Does mulching grass make it grow faster?</h3> <p>Mulching grass is achieved by using the mulching adjustment on a mower rather than collecting grass clippings in a bag. By allowing the clippings to biodegrade on the lawn, the soil may be healthier, but there’s no guarantee the grass will grow faster.</p> <h3>Q. When and in what quantity should mulch be used?</h3> <p>Weed-barrier fabric should be used in a single layer and added in early spring to warm the soil or at any other time of year for landscaping projects. Wood mulch chips and rubber nuggets can be used at any time of year and should typically be 2 to 3 inches thick.</p> <h3>Q. How often should old mulch be removed?</h3> <p>Old wood chip mulch often doesn’t have to be removed because it biodegrades, but if it seems too thick, rake it off before applying fresh mulch chips. Fabric mulch used for crops should be removed at the end of the growing season, while fabric mulch used in landscaping beds can last up to 5 years or more. Rubber mulch chips will last up to 14 years before it needs to be replaced.</p> <h3>Q. How is mulch maintained?</h3> <p>Mulch is virtually maintenance-free. It’s a set-it-and-forget-it product for the most part. If dyed mulch fades, it can be refreshed with mulch spray to give it a new look.</p>",253
650,soil test kits,"<p>The best soil test kit can help a gardener figure out the most beneficial fertilizers or amendments to add to a garden. Below are answers to some common questions about soil testing kits.</p> <h3>Q. Why do I need to test soil?</h3> <p>If plants are thriving, there’s no need to test the soil. However, if plants seem to wilt, die, or just do poorly, testing the soil could help determine if the problem is due to a structure or nutrient deficiency in the soil.</p> <h3>Q. Can I test my own soil?</h3> <p>Absolutely. Many DIY-type soil testers are available for testing everything from moisture and pH to the amount and type of nutrients in the soil.</p> <h3>Q. Are digital soil testers accurate?</h3> <p>Digital soil testers are usually reasonably accurate. Gardeners can increase accuracy by performing multiple tests in different spots of the garden and comparing the results.</p> <h3>Q. What are the soil-testing methods?</h3> <p>Soil test kits feature pH strips, analog or digital meters, and chemical testing. Professional testing is available by sending soil samples to a lab.</p> <h3>Q. What does a pH test measure?</h3> <p>A pH test measures the acidity and alkalinity levels of the soil.</p> <h3>Q. How do I adjust the pH level of my soil?</h3> <p>Soil treatments are available that will either raise or lower the soil’s pH level, depending on what the gardener is growing. These are often called pH-UP and pH-DOWN products.</p> <h3>Q. Do soil test kits expire?</h3> <p>Kits with pH strips may expire in a few months, especially if they’re not kept in an airtight container. Meters and monitors will not expire. However, if they’re battery operated, they will require new batteries when the old ones run down. Chemical kits are often good for 2 to 5 years.</p>",291
651,fertilizer for hibiscus,"<p>Keep reading for answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about using fertilizer and hibiscus plant care.</p> <h3>Q. Is hibiscus an indoor or outdoor plant?</h3> <p>Although a blooming hibiscus makes an attractive gift and a beautiful display, it requires intense light to grow well. For best results, plan on growing hibiscus outdoors, as long as the weather allows. When temperatures dip below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, bring the plants indoors to overwinter them.</p> <h3>Q. Do hibiscus plants come back every year?</h3> <p>Hardy hibiscus, including rose of Sharon and many perennial types, come back year after year in temperate regions. Tropical hibiscus will not withstand freezing temperatures and should be either brought indoors for the winter or considered an annual to be discarded at the end of the season.</p> <h3>Q. How do you take care of a hibiscus plant?</h3> <p>Whether they grow in the ground or containers, the care of a hibiscus plant is similar. Grow them in full sun to partial shade. Water them frequently to prevent the soil from drying out. Feed them lightly and regularly. And occasionally loosen the soil surface over the plants’ root zone to promote water and plant food penetration.</p> <h3>Q. How do you fertilize hibiscus?</h3> <p>Use a combination of balanced organic or slow-release granular fertilizer and high N and K liquid fertilizer. Spread the granular plant food on the soil surface. Apply the liquid by soaking the root zone.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I fertilize hibiscus?</h3> <p>Apply slow-release fertilizer two to four times per year, depending on the length of the growing season. Apply a weak solution (quarter-strength or half-strength) of liquid fertilizer weekly.</p>",271
652,rabbit repellent,"<p>If you have questions about how to apply rabbit repellent or when to use it, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions about these products.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use rabbit repellents in the winter?</h3> <p>Yes. In fact, rabbits remain active during the winter, which means they may still be chomping on trees and shrubs even after they’ve lost their leaves. Most rabbit repellents will work in cold or warm weather.</p> <h3>Q. Do I have to reapply repellent after it rains?</h3> <p>Most repellents are resistant to rain. However, that resistance is limited. Spray and granule repellents may begin to lose their efficacy after a heavy rain, requiring reapplication.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best time to apply the repellent?</h3> <p>Most rabbits do their feeding at night, so apply the repellent toward the end of the day when rabbits are getting ready to emerge to feed.</p> <h3>Q. Are rabbit repellents harmful to animals?</h3> <p>Since rabbit repellents have no synthetic additives, they won’t harm rabbits or other animals, including pets. That said, avoid applying the repellent to edibles as it may negatively affect the taste.</p>",185
653,garden hose,"<p>A few questions are to be expected for those looking to buy a quality garden hose that suits their needs. The type of anticipated watering chores will help determine the type and size of the hose.</p> <h3>Q. What size hose should I buy?</h3> <p>For most residences, a hose that’s ⅝ inch in diameter is sufficient for watering tasks. Standard hoses come in 25- to 75-foot lengths, so consider the size of the yard when buying. Naturally, a longer hose takes up more space for storage and is heavier to lug around, so factor that in as well.</p> <h3>Q. How do I reduce and get rid of kinks in my hose?</h3> <p>A high-quality hose is less likely to kink than an inexpensive model, but all hoses will benefit from stretching the hose out straight after use and then looping it in large 2- to 3-foot loops before hanging it on a large hook. Alternatively, a garden reel that winds and stores the hose will also help reduce kinks.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a garden hose nozzle for my hose?</h3> <p>If you want to water potted plants and other areas of the garden by hand, a nozzle is the best option. You can adjust the flow right at the plant and close it when pulling it around the yard or patio.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best way to store my hose and extend its longevity?</h3> <p>Even the most durable hoses will last longer if they’re not left out in the elements. To get the most use out of a hose, store it either in a garage, storage shed, or basement when not in use.</p>",271
654,weed barrier,"<p>Installing a weed barrier is an easy, effective, and affordable way to keep pesky weeds at bay. Once you’ve chosen and installed your weed barrier, it should provide year after year of weed reduction or elimination. Read on for some frequently asked questions and answers on installing and using your new weed barrier.</p> <h3>Q: Does weed barrier fabric let water through?</h3> <p>It depends on the type; nonwoven weed barrier fabrics tend to be less permeable, while woven barrier fabrics are made to let water through.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best weed barrier to use under rocks?</h3> <p>For rock landscaping, consider using a plastic, nonwoven weed barrier.</p> <h3>Q: Should I put a weed barrier under my raised beds?</h3> <p>You can put a weed barrier under a raised garden bed, but keep in mind that it will not prevent weeds from growing in the soil above the barrier.</p> <h3>Q: Is landscape fabric safe for vegetable gardens?</h3> <p>Yes, landscape fabric is safe to use in vegetable gardens.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between landscape fabric and a weed barrier?</h3> <p>The terms “landscape fabric” and “weed barrier” are often used interchangeably and often refer to the same type of product: a fabric-like material used to hinder weed growth.</p> <h3>Q: Can I put landscape fabric over weeds?</h3> <p>Yes, you can put landscape fabric over weeds and still have a good result. However, it’s best to clear the area first. Weed barrier might not stop all weed growth and can be punctured by sharp rocks or roots, so it’s best to clear and level the area before placing landscape fabric.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

655,plant mister,"<p>If you have lingering questions about why you should use a plant mister or whether a mister is right for your plants, then read on for answers to these and other concerns.</p> <h3>Q: What is a plant mister?</h3> <p>A plant mister is a small spray bottle that sprays out water in particles that are so tiny that some remain in the air, increasing humidity.</p> <h3>Q: Why should I use a plant mister?</h3> <p>Misting a plant accomplishes two things. It increases the humidity around the plant, which is vital for tropical plants that are used to humid environments, and misting also helps prevent overwatering.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need a plant mister?</h3> <p>While misting may not be necessary for all plants, it is a useful practice for some, especially those that normally grow in a tropical environment and are therefore used to high humidity.</p> <h3>Q: How often should I mist my plants?</h3> <p>In general, you should mist houseplants about one to two times per week. Look at the thickness of the leaves. Plants with thinner leaves can dry out more quickly, so they require more humidity than those with thicker foliage.</p> <h3>Q: Should I mist succulents?</h3> <p>Succulents do not like to be misted. It can cause the roots to dry out and the leaves to become moldy.</p> <h3>Q: Should I mist my snake plant?</h3> <p>Snake plants are succulents and therefore prefer to stay dry and instead take their water in through the roots. Misting a snake plant can damage its foliage.</p>",249
656,plant subscription boxes,"<p>You now know more about plant subscriptions, but you might still want more information about how they work. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about plant subscriptions.</p> <h3>Q. What is a plant subscription box?</h3> <p>Plant subscription boxes are live-plant delivery services that send one or more houseplants to the subscriber’s door at regular intervals.</p> <h3>Q. What’s included in a plant subscription box?</h3> <p>Some plant subscriptions come only with a houseplant in either a plastic container or a simple clay pot, while others include a decorative planter and perhaps additional accessories.</p> <h3>Q. How much do plant subscription boxes cost?</h3> <p>Plant subscription boxes vary in price, ranging from about $5 to $100 per delivery.</p> <h3>Q. What if a plant arrives damaged or unhealthy?</h3> <p>Most companies have policies in which subscribers can report a damaged or unhealthy plant and they can get either a replacement or a refund for that month’s box.</p> <h3>Q. Can subscriptions be paused?</h3> <p>Yes, most plan subscriptions have pause options as needed.</p> <h3>Q. How can a plant subscription box be canceled?</h3> <p>Verify the terms of a specific plant subscription to get instructions for how to cancel.</p>",192

How can I deter squirrels from my bird feeder?</h3> <p>A cone-shaped baffle attached to a pole can deter squirrels from climbing up to a bird feeder. Alternatively, hanging bird feeders specially designed to close off access under the weight of a squirrel provide a deterrent to those unwelcome guests.</p> <h3>Q. Can bird feeders attract rats, mice, and other pests?</h3> <p>Yes. Rodents and other pests may be attracted to the seeds and shells that the birds drop from the feeder. Use a seed-catching tray, clean up regularly, and install baffles to discourage unwelcome critters from accessing the bird feeder.</p>",301
658,deer feeders,"<p>Feeding deer is not a practice to be treated lightly. It requires research into the proper methods, placement of feeders, scheduling of feeding times, and recommended types of feed. In the interest of the deer’s health and safety, users who purchase deer feeders and establish feeding locations should learn as much as possible about the best practices for feeding these beautiful, wild creatures. Below, learn the answers to frequently asked questions about deer feeders.</p> <h3>Q. Where should I place a deer feeder?</h3> <p>Explore deer trails to find places that provide bedding and water. These will be the ideal spots to set up deer feeders. Stay away from roadways and open spaces.</p> <h3>Q. How do I hang a deer feeder?</h3> <p>Thread a length of rope through pieces of old garden hose to protect the tree bark when hanging a deer feeder from a tree. With a pulley, position the deer feeder approximately 5 feet off the ground.</p> <h3>Q. What should I put in a deer feeder?</h3> <p>Specially formulated and commercially available deer food mixtures include corn and additional nutrients. These mixtures may be purchased in large bags for filling deer-feeder hoppers.</p> <h3>Q. How do I attract deer to a deer feeder?</h3> <p>Scatter feed corn on the ground around the feeder to initially attract the deer. Once they discover the feeder, begin offering more nutritious pellets dispensed from the feeder’s hopper.</p> <h3>Q. What time should I set the deer feeder?</h3> <p>Working with automatic feeders that feature digital timers, many users program the feeders to dispense food for a few seconds in the early morning and again at dusk. However, observation of deer habits may inform users about setting the timers for additional daily feedings.</p> <h3>How do I keep raccoons off my deer feeder?</h3> <p>Coat the metal legs or the mounting poles with grease to prevent raccoons from climbing up to deer feeders. Use a feeder with a cage-like varmint guard around the spinner.</p> <h3>Q. How do I keep bears away from my deer feeder?</h3> <p>Using a steel pole, suspend a tightly sealed spinning feeder at least 8 feet off the ground. Install the steel pole at least 4 feet in the ground, and set it in concrete.</p>",365

660,wasp traps,"<p>If you’re wondering where to hang your new wasp trap or how to clean it, then read on for answers to these and other important questions about these devices.</p> <h3>Q. How effective are wasp traps?</h3> <p>Wasp traps are effective at attracting and trapping wasps; however, it’s crucial that the user place them properly. Wasp traps that are placed too close to living areas will actually attract more wasps to the area, increasing the likelihood of stings.</p> <h3>Q. Where should I hang a wasp trap?</h3> <p>Hang wasp traps at least 20 feet away from living spaces to ensure wasp activity does not increase near people. If possible, hang them in the boughs of nearby fruit trees, which is where wasps like to search for food.</p> <h3>Q. What should I put in a wasp trap?</h3> <p>Wasps love sugar, so sugary soft drinks, fruit juices, and sugar water make the best baits for a wasp trap.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean a reusable wasp trap?</h3> <p>First, make sure that there are no live wasps inside the trap to prevent potential stings. Next, remove the trap and carry it to an outdoor trash can. Remove the trap’s lid, then dump the dead wasps into the trash can. Use a hose to rinse out the trap, then reapply bait.</p> <h3>Q. Do bees get caught in wasp traps?</h3> <p>Depending on the type of bait you use, bees can end up caught in the trap. To prevent bees from entering the trap, use bait such as heptyl butyrate, which will attract wasps but won’t attract bees.</p>",259
661,soil for snake plants,"<p>Growing a snake plant is an easy way to add a splash of greenery to the home. While this plant tolerates a range of pH and moisture levels, it thrives if it’s planted in optimal soil. Newbie indoor gardeners may have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use cactus soil for snake plants?</h3> <p>Yes. Potting soil designed for use with cactus or other succulents drains well and is suitable for snake plants.</p> <h3>Q. What NPK ratio do I need for a snake plant?</h3> <p>In general, a balanced fertilizer, such as 10-10-10 NPK, is best for snake plants, but slight variations are also acceptable. Just look for an all-purpose indoor houseplant fertilizer.</p> <h3>Q. How do I properly prepare the soil for a snake plant?</h3> <p>The best way is to first add a layer of gravel or small rocks to the bottom of the pot and then add the soil. Some organic soils come in a dry, expandable form, and in that case, add water to the soil while it’s in a large bowl. After it absorbs the water, put the soil in the pot and plant the snake plant.</p> <h3>Q. Do snake plants like coffee grounds?</h3> <p>Coffee grounds are acidic and will lower the pH of the soil. For the best results, use a pH tester. If the pH is at or near 7, treat the snake plant to an occasional cup of cold coffee rather than adding coffee grounds.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use regular potting soil for snake plants?</h3> <p>As long as the potting soil is designed for indoor plants and drains well, snake plants will probably like it. Avoid outdoor soil and potting soils that have been opened and left open longer than a few months. Standing in an open container increases the risk of insects and disease.</p>",299
662,fertilizer for potatoes,"<p>While you now know more about choosing the best potato fertilizer, you might need more information about how to use it. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about fertilizing potatoes.</p> <h3>Q: When should I start fertilizing my potatoes?</h3> <p>Fertilize the soil before planting, if needed. Alternatively, fertilize simultaneously while planting.</p> <h3>Q: How much fertilizer should I use on potatoes?</h3> <p>A 1,000-square-foot plot requires approximately 25 pounds of fertilizer throughout the season.</p> <h3>Q: How do I apply fertilizer to potatoes?</h3> <p>The application depends on the type of fertilizer being used. Liquid fertilizers are meant to be mixed with water and applied while watering. Granular fertilizers are sprinkled on top of the soil or mixed into the soil before planting.</p> <h3>Q: How do you increase the yield of a potato crop?</h3> <p>Increase your potato crop’s yield by initially cutting your seed potatoes into small pieces, about the size of a standard ice cube, and starting them in a warm area. Throughout the growing season, ensure the soil is well fertilized and isn’t allowed to dry out.</p> <h3>Q: Is Epsom salt good for potatoes?</h3> <p>Yes, Epsom salt contains magnesium, which is beneficial for potatoes and improves growing conditions.</p> <h3>Q: Do potatoes like coffee grounds?</h3> <p>Adding coffee grounds to your compost blend is a great way to increase growth.</p>",220
663,soil for orchids,"<p>Orchids have a reputation for being challenging to grow as a houseplant, but today’s new hybrids can withstand most indoor conditions as long as their soil drains well. Those wondering about what soil to use for orchids may still have a few questions, so keep reading for answers to some of the most common.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use all-purpose soil for orchids?</h3> <p>No. All-purpose potting soil (or garden soil) is too dense and retains water, making it an unsuitable growing medium for orchids.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use any bark for orchids?</h3> <p>Any type of commercial bark is probably acceptable as long as it’s sterilized. Avoid harvesting bark from trees, as it might contain bacteria, disease, or insects that could kill the orchid.</p> <h3>Q. Can you plant an orchid in dirt?</h3> <p>No. Regular dirt from a yard or garden is too dense for orchids to drain sufficiently, and it likely contains traces of bacteria or insects.</p> <h3>Q. Are used coffee grounds good for orchids?</h3> <p>Skip the coffee grounds. They’re too acidic for orchids, and they can add to the density of the soil mix and reduce drainage.</p> <h3>Q. Is bark or moss better for orchids?</h3> <p>Bark is the more important of the two ingredients. Sphagnum peat moss is used to pot orchids just before they go to market, but by itself, it retains too much moisture. After an orchid has finished blooming, repot it in a soil mix with a higher bark-to-moss ratio.</p> <h3>Q. How do you repot an orchid?</h3> <p>Wait until it has finished blooming, and then repot the plant in an orchid pot: a container with holes or slits on the sides to encourage drainage. Use a soil mix created specifically for growing orchids.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you water an orchid in bark?</h3> <p>Water once a week during the slow season (fall and winter) and twice per week in spring and summer.</p>",314
664,fertilizer for indoor plants,"<p>While you now know more about choosing the best plant fertilizer, you might still want more information about how to use it. Here are some answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about fertilizing indoor plants.</p> <h3>Q. Why do indoor plants need fertilizer?</h3> <p>Houseplants have been removed from their natural habitat and are therefore lacking the macronutrients and micronutrients present in their native soil that helps them remain healthy. Fertilizers supplement these nutrients.</p> <h3>Q. What’s in houseplant fertilizer?</h3> <p>Houseplant fertilizers contain a mixture of macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and micronutrients that supplement the nutrients already in the plant’s soil.</p> <h3>Q. How do I fertilize indoor plants?</h3> <p>The fertilization method depends on the chosen formula. Add powder and granular fertilizers to the plant’s soil, then water. Dilute liquid fertilizers with water before application.</p> <h3>Q.

680,sprinkler valves,"<p>Sprinkler systems are a boon for helping water the lawn and landscape uniformly, but sprinkler valves don’t last forever. When one goes on the fritz, little or no water may come out of the sprinkler heads, or water may gush from a cracked valve. Some questions are likely for those seeking to replace worn or damaged valves.</p> <h3>Q. How does a sprinkler valve work?</h3> <p>A sprinkler valve regulates the flow of water. Some valves communicate via a buried irrigation wire with a central control unit that turns them on and off according to a program, while others are battery operated. Some are entirely manual, and still others utilize the force of water moving through the valve to control water flow.</p> <h3>Q. What are the symptoms of a bad sprinkler valve?</h3> <p>When a valve goes bad, sprinkler heads may emit weak streams of water—or no water at all. Dampness or sponginess may be noticeable around a sprinkler valve box if the valve is broken and leaking.</p> <h3>Q. How much does it cost to replace a sprinkler valve?</h3> <p>Depending on the type, a single replacement valve costs between about $4 and $65, while the best sprinkler manifold can cost up to $100 or more. While some systems use valves that are fairly simple for a DIYer to install, professional installation will add to the total cost.</p> <h3>Q. How often do sprinkler valves need to be replaced?</h3> <p>In general, the best irrigation valves last 5 to 10 years before needing replacement.</p> <h3>Q. How do you test a sprinkler valve?</h3> <p>If the sprinkler heads are not watering as they should be, open the valve box and look for flooding. If the valve is not leaking and is connected to an irrigation wire, use a voltmeter to test the voltage at both the valve and the central control unit. The solenoid on most sprinkler valves (the component that connects to the irrigation wire) should test between 24 and 28 volts.</p> <h3>Q. Does each sprinkler zone have its own valve?</h3> <p>Yes, each watering zone needs a separate valve.</p> <h3>Q. What causes a sprinkler valve to stay open?</h3> <p>Debris, such as sand or dirt, can get stuck in a valve and keep it from closing.</p> <h3>Q. Do sprinkler valves wear out?</h3> <p>Eventually, yes, but most will last 5 to 10 years, depending on quality.</p>",387
681,fertilizer for watermelon,"<p>Consider the answers to some of the frequently asked questions below about how to grow watermelons from first planting to harvest.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you fertilize watermelon plants?</h3> <p>A watermelon fertilizer schedule is determined by a garden’s specific soil condition at the beginning of the growing season. Then fertilize it according to the plants’ growing stage because each phase has varying nutritional needs.</p> <h3>Q. When should I fertilize watermelon?</h3> <p>Start fertilizing right after transplanting. Melons do best when treated with small amounts of fertilizer in two or three applications. During the growing season, liquid (soluble) fertilizers may be applied every 2 weeks and granular fertilizers about every 6 to 8 weeks. Since slow-release fertilizers work for months, one application is generally adequate.</p> <h3>Q. How do you grow sweeter watermelons?</h3> <p>Give the melons plenty of water until the final stage of ripening, about 10 to 14 days before harvest. Backing off a bit on watering helps concentrate sugar content, boosting sweetness. Also, as a general rule, the better the nutrient profile, the sweeter the fruit.</p> <h3>Q. Is Epsom salt good for watermelons?</h3> <p>Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate, a source of both magnesium and sulfur. Some anecdotal evidence exists that reports that Epsom salt produces sweeter watermelons. However, always test the soil to find out if it’s lacking these or other substances. Adding Epsom salt to soil with sufficient magnesium can harm your plants by inhibiting calcium uptake.</p> <p>To give it a try, prepare a solution of 6½ tablespoons Epsom salt and 3½ tablespoons borax in 5 gallons of water. Spray when the plant starts vining and again when small 1-inch melons appear.</p> <h3>Q. Are coffee grounds good for watermelon plants?</h3> <p>Coffee grounds contain the three major nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—and they also improve soil structure. Mix them in with compost or apply as a soil amendment, adding about ½ inch of grounds directly to the soil approximately 6 inches deep. You can also sprinkle them on top of the soil, but be careful not to let the grounds form a thick crust.</p> <h3>Q. What is the fastest way to add phosphorus to soil?</h3> <p>Apply bone meal (20 percent phosphate) and rock phosphate (27 percent) because both substances contain high concentrations of phosphorus that releases relatively quickly into the soil.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best time to plant watermelon?</h3> <p>In warm zones, sow seeds directly outdoors 1 to 2 weeks after daytime temperatures are regularly between 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit and the soil temperature measures 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit. In cooler climates, seed the plants indoors; then transplant them roughly 2 weeks after the last frost date, making sure the air and soil are warm enough.</p>",447
682,outdoor faucets,"<p>If you’re wondering which outdoor faucet is the best or whether you should cover the faucet in the wintertime, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q.

Is it better to drip or cover outdoor faucets?</h3> <p>Faucet covers can help prevent your outdoor faucet from freezing, but only to a certain degree. If the temperature falls below 28 degrees Fahrenheit, that cover likely won’t be enough. Allowing the faucet to drip is one way to prevent damage to the faucet, but it is by no means a long-term solution unless you like the idea of wasting water and jacking up your utility bill. Most outdoor faucets have a cutoff that allows you to close off and drain the line that leads to the outdoor spigot.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a faucet and a spigot?</h3> <p>The two terms are often used interchangeably, but generally speaking, a spigot is a plumbing fitting that extends to the exterior of the home. Most of the time a faucet is the term used to describe fittings on the home’s interior unless the word “outdoor” precedes the word “faucet.”</p> <h3>Q: Should outside faucets be left open or closed in winter?</h3> <p>Before the first freeze, it’s crucial to close the shut-off valve inside the home for the faucet.</p> <h3>Q: What is the standard outdoor faucet size?</h3> <p>Outdoor faucets are either ½-inch or ¾-inch in diameter. The size typically matches the plumbing inside the home. So, if the supply lines in the house are ¾-inch in diameter, the outdoor faucet will likely be ¾-inch.</p> <h3>Q. How much should it cost to replace an outside faucet?</h3> <p>The cost to replace an outside faucet ranges between $100 and $300 depending on the area. Installing a new outdoor hose bibb typically costs between $200 and $500.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep outside faucets from freezing?</h3> <p>To prevent an outdoor faucet from freezing, either install a frost-free hose bibb or turn the shut-off valve that leads the faucet to the off position, then open the faucet to drain the line.</p>",392
683,fertilizers for pumpkins,"<p>Take a look at some frequently asked questions below about how to grow pumpkins from planting to harvest.</p> <h3>Q. What nutrients do pumpkin plants need?</h3> <p>Pumpkins need different nutrients for each stage of growth. Before planting, prepare the soil with balanced amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Right before flowers form, the plants benefit from more nitrogen, after which they’ll need phosphorus as the flowers emerge to stimulate blossoms. Once pumpkins appear, give them a potassium-rich fertilizer to support healthy fruit production.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I fertilize my pumpkins?</h3> <p>Every 2 weeks.</p> <h3>Q. Why do pumpkin leaves turn yellow?</h3> <p>Lack of or too much water, nutrient deficiency, diseases such as verticillium wilt, or pests can all cause yellow leaves.</p> <h3>Q. How many pumpkins will one plant produce?</h3> <p>One plant will generally produce between two and five pumpkins.</p> <h3>Q. How can I increase pumpkin yields?</h3> <p>Branching—pinching the tips out of the main vines when they reach about 2 feet long—will yield more pumpkins. Some gardeners find that removing female flowers for the first 3 weeks improves yield.</p> <h3>Q. Is Miracle-Gro fertilizer good for pumpkins?</h3> <p>Used over a sustained period, Miracle-Gro and other similar inorganic products can encourage salt buildup in the soil and decrease a plant’s ability to take up nutrients. Like other inorganic fertilizers, the ingredients do not come from sustainable resources and are less eco-friendly.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I water my pumpkins?</h3> <p>Pumpkins contain between 80 and 90 percent water, so these thirsty plants need a lot of water. When soil is dry, irrigate them deeply with a minimum of 1 inch of water each week, being careful to keep the fruit and foliage dry. To simplify the process, some gardeners opt for a soaker hose or drip irrigation system. Pumpkins require even more water during periods of extreme heat or drought.</p>",305
684,weed killers for gravel,"<p>Once unwanted weeds appear, they can spread quickly, turning a good-looking gravel path into a shoddy mess. Most weed killers are made to kill existing weeds, but some are designed to keep future weeds seeds from sprouting. Those interested in protecting the look of a gravel walk or drive may still want more information, which will likely be found below in answers to some questions about these products.</p> <h3>Q.

How do I permanently get rid of grass in my gravel driveway?</h3> <p>The only permanent way to get rid of grass that grows in a gravel driveway is to pave over the gravel with concrete. Since that’s not an option for many, the next best thing is to use a weed killer to remove the existing weeds and then use a pre-emergent over the gravel to keep new weed seeds from sprouting. It’s not permanent, but with diligence it can keep the driveway looking neat.</p> <h3>Q. Will weed killer for gravel damage the soil?</h3> <p>It could—temporarily—depending on the product used. Some products leave residual traces behind that keep future weeds (and all plants) from growing for a few months to a year.</p>",270

A final application in the fall before the grass goes dormant is also a good idea to protect the roots of zoysia during its dormancy.</p> <h3>Q. Can you overfertilize zoysia grass?</h3> <p>Yes, it’s possible to overfertilize and weaken the grass by applying the fertilizer at a rate that exceeds the recommended rate or by using fertilizer more often than recommended.</p> <h3>Q. How do I make my zoysia grass green?</h3> <p>Apply a lawn fertilizer that’s high in nitrogen, such as NPK 15-0-8. The high nitrogen will encourage a rich green color.</p> <h3>Q. How do I make my zoysia grass thicker?</h3> <p>Zoysia grass spreads by rhizomes that run beneath the soil. The healthier the grass is, the denser it will become. In addition to zoysia grass fertilization, mow the lawn regularly (once or twice a week) and water during times of drought.</p> <h3>Q. Does zoysia grass require a lot of water?</h3> <p>Zoysia can tolerate frequent rainfall and slight drought conditions, but it will stay the healthiest with regular watering. Good zoysia grass care includes making sure the lawn has a minimum of 1 inch of water per week.</p> <h3>Q. How tall should you cut zoysia grass?</h3> <p>Zoysia is a low-growing grass that should be kept mowed at about 1.5 inches.</p>",303

In an established lawn, the best liquid fertilizer for sod will also be the best liquid fertilizer for grass.</p> <h3>Q. When should I apply liquid lawn fertilizer?</h3> <p>That depends on the specific product, but many liquid lawn fertilizers call for applying every 2 to 4 weeks, starting in early spring.</p> <h3>Q. When will I notice the results after applying liquid lawn fertilizer?</h3> <p>Sometimes as soon as the next day. In liquid form, nitrogen is quickly absorbed by the grass and it should appear greener in 1 to 3 days.</p> <h3>Q. How long does liquid lawn fertilizer last?</h3> <p>Unfortunately, liquid fertilizer for grass passes out of the soil more quickly than granulated fertilizers, so plan to reapply a liquid lawn fertilizer every 2 to 4 weeks, as recommended on the package.</p>",286

691,weed killer for flower beds,"<p>Flower beds are at their most striking when they’re full of beautiful blooms—not weeds. Gardeners are always free to use the time-honored tradition of hand-weeding, but for those who’d like a little assistance, herbicides can help. Those who are new to cultivating flowers are likely to have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q. How do I weed-proof a flower bed?</h3> <p>You can’t completely weed-proof a flower bed. However, you can greatly reduce the number of weeds by applying a pre-emergent herbicide to the bed once desirable plants are established but before weeds sneak in.</p> <h3>Q.

Are weed killers safe for plants?</h3> <p>Only if the weed killer is a selective product designed not to harm plants. If it’s nonselective, it will kill beneficial plants as well as weeds.</p> <h3>Q. Are natural weed killers effective?</h3> <p>Yes, and they’re better for the environment. In some cases, however, they may not be as strong as chemical weed killers, and users may need to use more than one application.</p> <h3>Q. Is weed killer safe to use if you have pets?</h3> <p>It varies. Follow the application instructions carefully. Many weed killers list a certain amount of time that must elapse before allowing pets to play in a treated area. In general, natural weed killers are safer than chemical-based weed killers.</p>",281
692,fertilizers for apple trees,"<p>In most types of soil, growing apple trees isn’t too challenging, and many apple trees will start producing apples after a few years, even without feedings. However, applying fertilizer is a good idea for those who want healthier trees and more apples. Newbie growers may have a few questions.</p> <p>Q. What do fertilizers provide for apple trees?</p> <p>Fertilizers offer various amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium—minerals absorbed by the tree’s roots and leaves to boost health and increase blossom production.</p> <p>Q. How do I get my apple tree to produce fruit?</p> <p>Apple trees may not produce fruit for the first 3 to 5 years, but, after that, they can produce apples annually. Apply a balanced fertilizer, such as one with a 10-10-10 NPK or a 5-5-5 NPK, to give the tree ample nutrients for fruit production. Supply water during times of drought as well.</p> <p>Q.

Fertilize a new sapling at the time of planting, and then fertilize it every spring and fall until it reaches its mature growth. Mature apple trees only need to be fertilized once a year, in the spring. While those are rules of thumb, some fertilizer products suggest feeding the trees more often, so follow package directions.</p> <p>Q. How do you increase the size of an apple fruit?</p> <p>In addition to fertilizing apple trees on the suggested schedule, keep in mind that the apples themselves draw nutrients and energy from the tree. Growers often pinch off more than two or three apples per cluster (as soon as the fruits start to develop), which makes for fewer—but larger—apples.</p> <p>Q. How much fertilizer does an apple tree need?</p> <p>That all depends on its size and the fertilizer product. The package instructions should recommend the amount of product to use based on the size of the tree.</p>",324

697,lawn edger,"<p>After reading the various shopping tips and factors involved in selecting a lawn edger, you may still have a few questions about the best depth for edging or how frequently a lawn should be edged. For answers to these questions and more, continue reading.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best way to edge a lawn?</h3> <p>Choose a suitable lawn edger that meets your preferences and needs for yard work. This can include a battery-powered edger, a gas lawn edger, a corded-electric lawn edger, and a manual lawn edger.</p> <p>When you have the tool of choice ready for the job, mark out the exact area you want to edge. This step becomes less important with more experienced individuals who can eyeball the exact cut, but for DIYers new to edging, this is an important step to ensure the edging line is even along the entire border of the yard or garden. Consider marking the area with stakes and string, especially when working with rounded corners and curving garden beds.</p> <p>Mow the lawn first to help create a clean edge at a consistent depth, and proceed to cut thin strips of sod from the edge of the lawn, ensuring that the edger tool remains within the boundaries laid out. If the lawn edger has a variable speed trigger, it can be easier to get precise lines while edging. When the job is done, clean up the driveway, path, or sidewalk with a leaf blower or a broom.</p> <h3>Q: How deep should I edge my lawn?</h3> <p>Typically about 2 to 4 inches deep is sufficient for controlling the growth and spread of grass roots, keeping the grass from growing into the gaps in the patio or walkway.</p> <h3>Q: Do you edge every time you mow?</h3> <p>It depends on the grass. Some grass grows and spreads very quickly, so you need to at least check the edge lines every time you mow. While most yards won’t require edging every time the grass is mowed, it’s likely to need edging every two or three times it’s been cut with a mower.</p> <h3>Q: Should I edge before or after I mow?</h3> <p>Whether you edge or mow first is almost entirely a matter of preference. If you choose to edge first, the mower will help clean up excess grass clippings, but if you mow first then it’s easier to create a straight edge at a consistent depth.</p> <h3>Q. What is the easiest edger to use?</h3> <p>Ease of use varies among people and products, but one of the easiest edgers to use is the Bully Tools 92251 Round Lawn Edger. Just line up the manual spade edger and push down with your foot to cut into the turf. Continue this process along the entire edge to complete the job.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best gas-powered edger?</h3> <p>A gas-powered edger is a heavy-duty tool equipped with a powerful motor and durable shaft to help cut through thick turf. The McLane 101-5.5GT-7Gas Powered Lawn Edger is among the best gas-powered options available.</p>",501
698,patio heater,"<p>Having a heat source in an outdoor area offers the ability to entertain comfortably when the temperatures drop. For those thinking of buying a patio heater, some questions are to be expected.</p> <h3>Q: Which electric patio heaters are the best?</h3> <p>The Dr Infrared Heater DR-238 Carbon Infrared Heater is among the best options for those wanting convenient electric heat in an enclosed patio setting.</p> <h3>Q: How many BTUs do I need for my patio heater?</h3> <p>When it comes to patio heaters, one size does not fit all. Natural gas and propane patio heaters range from around 5,000 to 40,000 BTUs or more. Choose an option that best suits the level of desired heat output.</p> <h3>Q: How far should the patio heater be from the house?</h3> <p>Place a gas patio heater and a freestanding electric patio heater a minimum of 3 feet from walls and other items, such as furniture. However, some electric heaters are designed to be safe even if mounted on a wall or ceiling, so it depends on the type.</p> <h3>Q: Can you have a patio heater under a covered patio?</h3> <p>Most electric patio heaters are designed for use in sheltered patio conditions, like under a covered or enclosed patio. A small gas patio heater, such as a tabletop model, can usually operate safely under a covered patio, but a traditional tower-style model may stand too high (within 5 feet of the ceiling) for safe use.</p> <h3>Q: Can you put a patio heater under a gazebo?</h3> <p>It is safe to put a patio heater under a gazebo as long as it isn’t within 3 feet of the gazebo’s sidewalls or ceiling rafters.</p>",274
699,lawn fertilizer,"<p>See answers to the most commonly asked questions about lawn fertilizer below.</p> <h3>Q: When is the best time to fertilize your lawn?</h3> <p>For cool-season grasses, like tall fescue and Kentucky bluegrass, fertilize when the soil reaches 55 degrees, or when it has begun active growth. For warm-season grasses like bermuda grass, zoysia, and centipede grass, fertilize when the grass has turned at least 50 percent green after winter dormancy.</p> <h3>Q: How often should you fertilize your lawn?</h3> <p>Feeding frequency depends on the fertilizer formula, type of grass, climate, weather, and soil nutrient levels. Overfertilization is a far greater risk to the lawn itself and to the environment than not fertilizing. With organic lawn fertilizers, two applications are typically adequate, unless directed otherwise by soil test results.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best ratio for lawn fertilizer?</h3> <p>The best way to know what your lawn needs is to test the soil. Avoid using balanced analysis plant foods like 10-10-10 or 15-15-15 fertilizer for lawns. Although these products hold some of the nutrients that grass needs, they do not offer them in the right amounts. Instead, use lawn fertilizer with an analysis that equates a 4-0-2 or 4-1-2 ratio.</p> <h3>Q: What is a natural lawn fertilizer?</h3> <p>Natural lawn fertilizers are made with animal and/or plant byproducts as the nutrient source, rather than mined minerals or chemical products. The nutrient analysis of natural fertilizer tends to be lower than that of conventional fertilizer, but natural products offer additional benefits such as increasing soil organic matter, boosting beneficial soil microbes, providing for an extended feed, and minimizing nutrient runoff.</p>",264

702,patio umbrellas,"<p>This guide sheds a lot of light on the best patio umbrellas, but some questions might remain. The following are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about patio umbrellas.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for when buying a patio umbrella?</h3> <p>You’ll want to ensure that the umbrella you choose not only fits your budget, style, and size requirements but also is built from durable materials such as aluminum and synthetic fabrics.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most durable patio umbrella?</h3> <p>Umbrellas made of an aluminum framework and Sunbrella or other synthetic fabrics will last the longest.</p> <h3>Q. What color patio umbrella is best for sun protection?</h3> <p>Although lighter colors might seem to be the logical choice, it’s the darker colors that do a better job of keeping sunlight out. Black is best but rarely fits the aesthetic. Look for a darker color, such as blue or green, that works with your patio design and also absorbs UV rays.</p> <h3>Q. Is steel or aluminum better for a patio umbrella?</h3> <p>Aluminum is usually best. Though aluminum frames are not always as strong as steel frames, they offer the best resistance against corrosion and balance of strength to weight.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to clean a patio umbrella?</h3> <p>Many patio umbrellas are machine washable. Simply remove the fabric from the frame, and toss it in the wash by itself with a mild detergent. If it’s not machine washable, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.</p> <h3>Q. How do you get mildew out of an outdoor umbrella?</h3> <p>If mold or mildew is growing on your umbrella, it might not be time to throw it out just yet. A liquid mold remover may do the trick. Follow the instructions on the container, and allow the product to work its magic.</p>",296

704,lounge chair,"<p>Choosing the right patio lounge chair is an investment in your outdoor enjoyment, so it pays to ask some questions before you pull out that credit card.</p> <h3>Q. Which type of lounge chair do I need?</h3> <p>Consider how much room you have available for the chair(s) and how and when you plan to use them. You might want the type that sits upright for conversation and then reclines if you plan on entertaining guests, and you’ll want to choose a chair that’s waterproof if it’s going to be near the pool.</p> <h3>Q. What material is the best for a lounge chair?</h3> <p>That depends on your style and budget. Redwood, teak, and cedar loungers are classy but can be pricey, while aluminum and resin loungers won’t give you a natural look, but they can be just as attractive and they come at a more affordable price point.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean sweat stains from my lounge chair?</h3> <p>Try mixing 1 teaspoon of Borax (in the laundry soap aisle) and 1 teaspoon of liquid dish soap in 1 quart of warm water and stir until the Borax dissolves. Use a clean rag to dab the solution on the stain and let it remain for 10 minutes before wiping off with a clean damp rag. The sooner you clean a sweat stain, the better the chance you can get rid of it.</p>",230
705,patio chairs,"<p>Take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers below to learn more about patio chairs and how to maintain them.</p> <h3>Q: What are the most durable patio chairs?</h3> <p>The most durable patio chairs are typically made out of stainless steel, wrought iron, or aluminum. Aluminum is more resistant to water than stainless steel or wrought iron, but it isn’t as strong. Whereas wrought iron is less water-resistant than either stainless steel or aluminum, it has greater strength. Stainless steel shares the beneficial qualities of both, but to a slightly lesser degree, so the most durable could be said to be any one of the three, with an average lifetime of about 20 years.</p> <h3>Q: What is a zero gravity chair? </h3> <p>Zero-gravity chairs are recliners that balance and evenly distribute the body weight of the person reclining in the chair. This has the effect of releasing built-up tension in the muscles and allowing the spine to settle into a neutral position.</p> <h3>Q: How do you maintain patio furniture?</h3> <p>Maintaining patio furniture during warmer months is as simple as wiping them down before and after use and covering the chairs up with furniture covers when they aren’t being used. In the colder months, the chairs should also be covered, but it would be best to store them in a basement, shed, or garage to protect the material from frigid temperatures and snow.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

706,outdoor sectionals,"<p>With so many options at a range of price points, choosing an outdoor sectional can feel overwhelming. If you’re still having trouble finding the most comfortable outdoor sectional for your space, read on for answers to some frequently asked questions on choosing and maintaining an outdoor sectional.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a sectional and an outdoor sofa?</h3> <p>An outdoor sofa is a one-piece unit, while an outdoor sectional comprises two or more sections or pieces.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of furniture is best outside?</h3> <p>Look for furniture pieces that are designed specifically to be placed outside. Outdoor furniture is made of durable materials and performance fabrics to withstand outdoor conditions. Whether you buy a new sectional or DIY some furniture, look for materials that resist water, corrosion, mildew, and UV rays to bring long-lasting comfort outdoors. Don’t place indoor furniture outdoors.</p> <h3>Q: How do I care for my outdoor furniture?</h3> <p>Follow the manufacturers’ directions to clean and maintain outdoor furniture. Protect the furniture from the elements by covering it or bringing in the pieces when the furniture is not in use and during inclement weather. Outdoor furniture needs frequent dusting and an occasional deeper cleaning with material-appropriate cleaners. Certain materials may also need protective maintenance every few seasons; for example, some wood types should be oiled or sealed periodically.</p> <h3>Q: What is the most sturdy outdoor furniture?</h3> <p>Many sturdy options are available in outdoor furniture. Generally, materials like teak wood, wrought iron, and stainless steel are more durable than aluminum and plastic. Look for a more substantial design (for example, thick, sturdy chair legs rather than thinner, daintier options). A sturdy design and durable materials help outdoor furniture last longer.</p> <h3>Q: How long does teak furniture last?</h3> <p>With proper cleaning and maintenance, high-quality teak furniture can last a lifetime.</p>",300
707,outdoor bar stools,"<p>Perfect for entertaining or just relaxing, patio bar stools can help create an inviting outdoor space, providing ample seating in a relatively small footprint. Still having trouble deciding the best outdoor bar stools for your home? Read on for some frequently asked questions and answers on this versatile and stylish outdoor furniture option.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best material for outdoor bar stools?</h3> <p>The best material for outdoor bar stools is durable, fade-resistant, and weather-resistant. Some of the top long-lasting materials include resin, aluminum, and teak.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between counter stools and bar stools?</h3> <p>Counter stools are slightly shorter than bar stools, intended for use at shorter kitchen counters rather than taller bar tables. However, since heights can vary so much between tables, always make sure to measure before buying counter- or bar-height outdoor chairs.</p> <h3>Q. How do I measure for outdoor bar stools?</h3> <p>Start with measuring the distance from the floor to the bottom of the counter. Decide how much space you want between the bar and the bar stool seat (10 to 12 inches is usually recommended). Subtract this number from the floor-to-counter height to get the ideal seat height for new bar stools. Also measure the bar width to determine how many bar stools can fit in the space, making sure to leave at least 6 inches of room between each stool.</p> <h3>Q. Are bar stools with backs better?</h3> <p>Bar stools with backs are more supportive and can be more comfortable; however, they can also take up more space.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean outdoor bar stools?</h3> <p>The best way to clean outdoor bar stools depends on the bar stool material. Start with dusting off the outdoor bar stool with a soft cloth, then follow the manufacturer’s directions for a deeper clean.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use outdoor bar stools inside?</h3> <p>Yes, it’s perfectly fine to use outdoor bar stools inside—in fact, since they’re designed to be durable, they may hold up to daily wear and tear even better than indoor bar stools.</p>",337
708,cat repellents,"<p>Though you now know more about cat repellents, you may still have questions about how to use them. The following are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about how to select and use cat repellents around the home.</p> <h3>Q. Are cat repellents safe around my pets?</h3> <p>Cat repellents typically deter a wide variety of critters and may act as repellents for household pets. However, all of our recommended options are completely safe for pet owners and won’t harm pets.</p> <h3>Q. How can I keep my neighbor’s cat out of my yard?</h3> <p>The best deterrent to keep cats out of a yard is a motion-activated sprinkler that emits a startling sound as well as a burst of water when an animal is detected nearby.</p> <h3>Q. Which scent will repel a cat?</h3> <p>Many commercially formulated cat repellent sprays are made with ingredients that deter cats. Some natural ingredients include citrus, vinegar, and peppermint.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best cat repellent for outside?</h3> <p>When attempting to keep cats out of a yard or garden, we recommend the Orbit Yard Enforcer Motion-Activated Sprinkler.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use cat repellent spray on a couch?</h3> <p>Certain cat repellent sprays are specially formulated for use on furniture and upholstery. Avoid using any other kind of spray on a couch to prevent staining.</p>",218
709,storage shed,"<p>For more information on outdoor storage sheds, consult these frequently asked questions about shed flooring, foundations, and additional features such as gutters or ventilation.</p> <h3>Q: How large a shed can I put in my backyard?</h3> <p>The maximum size storage shed for your backyard depends on the city, county, and development in which you live. Check zoning ordinances and your homeowners association’s rules to determine what size sheds are allowed on your property.</p> <h3>Q: Do sheds need a foundation?</h3> <p>In general, smaller gardening sheds that measure about 8 feet by 6 feet or smaller do not require a foundation; instead, they can be mounted on a treated wood or crushed stone base. However, larger sheds require a sturdy foundation such as poured concrete or concrete blocks.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need a permit for a shed?</h3> <p>That depends on the jurisdiction. Many cities and states require a permit for outdoor sheds for any single dimension (height, width, or length) that exceeds 12 feet.</p> <h3>Q: Do sheds need gutters? </h3> <p>Although outdoor sheds don’t typically need gutters, some purchasers may want to add them. If your area receives a lot of annual precipitation, gutters and downspouts help prevent rainwater from pooling around the base of the shed, which could damage the base or even cause water to leak inside it.</p> <h3>Q: Do sheds need vents?</h3> <p>Vents in a garden shed allow hot, moist air to escape and prevent condensation from forming inside the shed, which could lead to mold growth.</p> <h3>Q: Do sheds come with floors? </h3> <p>Some sheds have floors, while others require a floor kit. Most wooden sheds include floors, while most metal and plastic ones do not.</p>",275
710,pool test kit,"<p>Using a pool test kit may seem complicated, especially if pool owners don’t know how it works, when it should be used, and if it needs to be replaced. For the answers to these questions and more, take a look below.</p> <h3>Q. How does a pool test kit work?</h3> <p>A pool test kit comes with various reagents that need to be added to pool water samples to measure the pH and chemical balance of the water. Some test kits have just two reagents, but others can have as many as seven, depending on the various chemicals the test kit is designed to detect.</p> <h3>Q. Are digital pool testers more accurate?</h3> <p>Some high-end digital pool testers can be accurate to within +/- 1 percent. Pool test kits require a person to add drops manually, which can affect the accuracy of the result. However, if pool test kits are used exactly as intended, they are as accurate as a digital pool tester and more affordable.</p> <h3>Q. How often should the pH level of pool water be checked?</h3> <p>Check the pH balance of the pool water two to three times a week, depending on the frequency with which the pool is used.</p> <h3>Q. Do pool test kits go bad?</h3> <p>Pool test kits contain reagents that can break down over time. Look for the expiration date on the product, and be sure to replace the pool test kit if it has expired.</p>",238
711,hedge trimmer,"<p>Adding a power hedge trimmer to your yard maintenance arsenal can help keep vegetation under control. However, you may still have questions, like whether a gas or electric cordless hedge trimmer is more powerful or what type of oil is best. Take a look below for the answers to these and several more frequently asked questions about hedge trimmers.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a hedge trimmer and a hedge cutter?</h3> <p>Hedge trimmers are lightweight tools made for trimming smaller branches, leaves, and vegetation. Hedge cutters are a more robust tool that cuts through much thicker branches and even the trunks of very small trees, shrubs, and hedges.</p> <h3>Q: Are gas hedge trimmers more powerful than electric or battery-powered ones?</h3> <p>Battery-powered hedge trimmers have a limited amount of power because they must convert energy from the lithium-ion battery to the electric motor. Corded electric hedge trimmers are more powerful because they have a direct connection to a power source. However, the most powerful type of hedge trimmer is gas due to the large combustion engine that burns gas at a controlled rate to drive the blades.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of oil do I need to use with a gas hedge trimmer?</h3> <p>It’s advised to use the oil that is recommended by the manufacturer. Typically this will be a 2-cycle blend like the Briggs &amp; Stratton 2-Cycle Easy Mix Motor Oil that is a fuel stabilizer or the semi-synthetic Husqvarna HP SYNTH 2-CYCLE OIL.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best electric hedge trimmer on the market?</h3> <p>The best electric hedge trimmer can differ depending on personal preference, but one of the best options is the Earthwise 20-Inch Cordless Hedge Trimmer with the six-position adjustable head for precise control.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best cordless hedge trimmer to buy?</h3> <p>The EGO Power+ HT2410 24-Inch Brushless 56-Volt Cordless Hedge Trimmer is one of the best cordless hedge trimmers on the market due to the 24-inch dual-action hardened-steel blades and 1-inch-cut capacity.</p>",328
712,leaf vacuum,"<p>Leaf vacuums aren’t complicated once you understand how they work and what kind of features are needed for specific jobs. However, since they aren’t as common as leaf blowers, you might still find yourself scratching your head as you look at the specs. Here, we answer some of the most common questions about leaf vacuums to help you make the right choice.</p> <h3>Q: What machine is best for picking up leaves?</h3> <p>Handheld leaf vacuums work best for small yards and few leaves. Once the dry or wet leaves start piling up, a backpack or an electric model will offer longer running times and a larger collection-bag capacity. Gas leaf vacuums also work well for large yards, though they do require more maintenance and can be heavy.</p> <h3>Q: How powerful does a leaf vacuum need to be?</h3> <p>Look at the leaf vacuum’s mph and cfm when determining the power. While these measurements aren’t volts or amps, they are a better indicator of the quantity of leaves the vacuum can handle. Speeds of anywhere between 110 to 220 mph are usually adequate for leaf removal.</p> <p>The cfm tells you the quantity of dry or wet leaves the vacuum can move at once. Higher numbers (at 200 or higher) mean more powerful suction and removal. However, a model with a well-designed tube can provide adequate suction at 95 cfm and above.</p> <h3>Q: Will a lawn vacuum pick up grass clippings?</h3> <p>A lawn vacuum can pick up grass clippings. However, depending on its power and cfm, it may struggle with wet clippings.</p> <h3>Q: Can you clean gutters with a leaf vacuum?</h3> <p>Although the angle of use is not quite right, it is possible to clean gutters with a leaf vacuum. However, a leaf vacuum may not have the power to remove wet leaves.</p> <h3>Q: How do I switch from blower to vacuum?</h3> <p>The process of switching from blower to vacuum depends on the make and model of the device. Some models require nothing more than the flip of a switch. Others require extra tools to remove a blow tube before functioning as a vacuum. Check the owner’s manual for specific instructions.</p>",357
713,mulching blades,"<p>Mulching blades are likely a new concept to folks who do their own yard work. Here are some answers to common questions.</p> <h3>Q: Is mulching better than bagging leaves?</h3> <p>Mulching allows leaves to break down into organic fertilizer much faster, and it’s less work whoever is mowing. For those who hate raking and bagging leaves in the fall, mulching is undoubtedly the better solution. If you use a bagger, you’ll be able to dump leaf litter in a garden bed for organic matter, or past the woodline where they can break down into the ecosystem.</p> <p>Another option is to simply shred the leaves into leaf litter and leave them on the lawn. This looks a little messier than bagging but can enrich the soil over the course of the winter. As the small leaf particles work their way between the blades of grass, they’ll break down and leech nutrients into the soil.</p> <h3>Q: Can you install mulching blades on any lawn mower?</h3> <p>There are mulching blades available for most mowers, but not all mowers should have mulching blades installed. Underpowered models may not have the horsepower to spin a heavy mulching blade at an effective speed, providing mixed results when cutting and mulching.</p> <h3>Q: How often should I mulch my lawn?</h3> <p>You can use your mulching blade year-round. Most people that install mulching blades don’t bother changing them until they become too dull to cut effectively, in which case they’ll have them sharpened.</p>",243
714,self propelled lawn mower,"<p>After learning about the features of self-propelled lawn mowers, there may be some lingering questions about how these mowers work, what features to look for, and what size is appropriate for the yard. Some of the most common questions and answers are below.</p> <h3>Q. What does a self-propelled lawn mower do?</h3> <p>A self-propelled mower has a front- or rear-drive system that moves the mower forward without the user doing anything except holding on and steering.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for when buying a lawn mower?</h3> <p>There are many important things to consider when buying a lawn mower. Some unique features include a blade stop system that automatically stops the blade from spinning when the trigger is released and an electric-start system on a gas mower, so users don’t need to pull a recoil cord to crank the engine.</p> <p>Electric starts are a feature that may be better for mowers with an auto choke because the power transferred to the engine is consistent, instead of relying on the pull of the user. Other features to look for are a side-discharge, rear-discharge, or included bag attachment, to know how the machine handles grass clippings. More features are discussed in detail in the What to Consider section above.</p> <h3>Q. What size lawn mower do I need?</h3> <p>Gas lawn mowers are generally better than electric mowers for large yards, but the ideal size of the self-propelled lawn mower depends on the size of the yard. Large yards with more than 1 acre of lawn to mow are best with a mower with a powerful engine and a deck measuring between 21 to 23 inches in width. Users with lawns smaller than 1 acre can invest in mowers with cutting decks that measure 18 to 20 inches in size.</p> <h3>Q. Is front-wheel or rear-wheel drive better for a lawn mower?</h3> <p>Both front-wheel and rear-wheel drive are suitable for self-propelled lawn mowers. A front-wheel-drive mower is better for mostly level terrain and for easier maneuverability. Choose a rear-wheel-drive mower for better power, traction, and fewer problems mowing hilly terrain.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most reliable brand of lawn mowers?</h3> <p>There are several different brands of lawn mowers that are known for their reliability, cutting power, and high-quality performance including Greenworks, EGO Power, Craftsman, and PowerSmart.</p>",380
715,hose reel,"<p>For more information about the best hose reel, check out these answers to some of the most frequently asked questions. If additional concerns arise, contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a hose reel?</h3> <p>When choosing a garden hose reel, consider the length and diameter of the hose you want to connect to ensure compatibility. The size of your yard will help you choose between portable and stationary. If you have a large yard, you may want to find the best hose reel cart.</p> <p>Then you need to make decisions regarding your willingness to manually reel, the material you want, how much you want to spend, and any additional features you may wish to have.</p> <h3>Q: Are brass hose fittings better than plastic?</h3> <p>Brass hose fittings are more durable than plastic fittings; they are more robust and will last longer. Brass is also more expensive than plastic.</p> <h3>Q: Which type of hose reel material lasts the longest?</h3> <p>Resin hose reels last the longest.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of hose reel is best for small yards?</h3> <p>The best garden hose reel for a small yard is the Giraffe Hose Reel with 5/8 in. x 65 ft Water Hose.</p> <h3>Q: Where do you mount a hose reel?</h3> <p>You mount a garden hose reel close to a water spout. Hose reels come with a leader hose that could be 5 to 6 feet long. You can mount the reel 5 to 6 feet away from the water spout.</p>",245
716,zero turn mower,"<p>Before investing in a new zero turn mower, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers.</p> <h3>Q: What are zero turn mowers?</h3> <p>Zero turn mowers are riding lawn mowers that you can turn in a zero-degree radius using hydraulic speed control of the individual drive wheels, instead of having both wheels powered to the same level by a combined control.</p> <p>This allows you to accelerate one drive wheel, while the other remains unmoved, so only one side of the mower turns, allowing you to fully turn the mower within its own footprint.</p> <h3>Q: Are zero turn mowers better than lawn tractors?</h3> <p>Both zero turn mowers and lawn tractors have their strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation. Zero turn mowers are intended for medium to extra large yards that have a lot of curves but not many inclines.</p> <p>They operate at a faster speed, but the controls may take some time to master, while lawn tractors have controls similar to a car, so they are relatively easy to learn. Lawn tractors can’t make the same sharp turns, but they are better for inclines. Both zero turn mowers and lawn tractors risk tipping over if you use them on inclines greater than 15 degrees.</p> <h3>Q: How do you steer a zero turn mower?</h3> <p>You steer a zero turn mower by moving the control levers. Both levers straight ahead will make you move forward in a straight line. If you pull one lever back slightly, it will decrease the power to that wheel, while the other side of the mower retains its power.</p> <p>This difference in power output causes the mower to turn. For a zero-degree turn, only use one lever to move. This will result in only one side of the mower being powered, while the other side turns in place so the mower can fully rotate within its own footprint.</p> <h3>Q: Do zero turn mowers have a brake?</h3> <p>Most zero turn mowers don’t have a traditional foot-pedal brake, but they do have lever controls that increase or decrease the acceleration of the mower. They also typically come equipped with a parking brake or an emergency brake.</p> <h3>Q: Do zero turn mowers work on slopes?</h3> <p>Zero turn mowers can work on slopes, though they are better for handling curves. Lawn tractors are best suited to slopes; however, both types can tip over if they are on an incline over 15 degrees.</p> <h3>Q: How do you maintain a zero turn mower?</h3> <p>To maintain a zero turn mower, you must consistently follow these maintenance procedures:</p> <ol><li>Regularly check and replace the oil, spark plugs, and air filter to ensure they all continue working effectively.</li><li>Clean the mower deck after each use to prevent dirt, grass, and other debris from building up. If you don’t regularly clean moisture from the deck caused by built-up grass clippings, it can cause significant damage to the deck and blades. Cleaning the mower deck also provides a much smoother cut.</li><li>Have your mower blades sharpened two to three times a year, depending on the frequency with which you mow.</li><li>Check the tires before every use to ensure they are all at the same air pressure and height.</li><li>Store your zero turn mower in an enclosed space, like a shed or garage, so it isn’t exposed to rain, snow, or even extreme sunlight for an extended period.</li></ol>",556
717,metal detector,"<p>Before investing in a new metal detector, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers below.</p> <h3>Q: What makes a good metal detector?</h3> <p>A quality metal detector should have features that will help the user get the most accurate readings possible. These features include a ground balance setting to focus the detector on specific materials, and high-quality sensitivity control. Look for a model with fast reactivity time, so you can pinpoint or pick up several objects in a single sweep.</p> <h3>Q: How deep do most metal detectors go?</h3> <p>Most metal detectors can detect materials at depths between 2 inches to about 15 inches.</p> <h3>Q: Which metals do metal detectors detect?</h3> <p>Most metal detectors should be able to detect various types of metal, though the type of detector will impact how strong the signal is from less conductive metals like aluminum, iron, zinc, lead, or heavily corroded or coated metal objects. These kinds of metals have less of an electromagnetic signature for the detector’s magnetic field to pick up.</p> <h3>Q: Can a normal metal detector find gold?</h3> <p>All metal detectors can find gold if it’s within the device’s prescribed depth range and the pieces of gold are big enough for the detector to find. A gold metal detector is a specialized device designed specifically for finding gold.</p>",219
718,machete,"<p>If you still have questions about using a machete, read on for several pointers on using and caring for your new tool.</p> <h3>Q. Are machetes legal to own and use?</h3> <p>Machetes are classified as agricultural tools and are allowed for use as such.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for in a machete? </h3> <p>Start by choosing a machete type that is designed to do the work you need to get done. It should be comfortable to use and made of high-quality materials.</p> <h3>Q. How do you properly swing a machete?</h3> <p>First, pinch-grip the handle securely with the thumb and forefinger to form a fulcrum. Allow the other three fingers to hold the base of the handle loosely as shock absorbers. There should be some wiggle room. Never squeeze the handle so tightly as to leave a print on the palm.</p> <p>With the vegetation directly in front of you, raise the blade and direct your full arm to strike at a downward angle. Lead the downswing with the elbow and follow through with the shoulder. Use the loose fingers and wrist to flick downward on impact with woody material or slightly upward when clearing grassy vegetation.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen a machete?</h3> <p>For general utility, sharpen the blade to a 25-degree angle. For finer work, it can be as narrow as 20 degrees. For coarse chopping, it could be as broad as 35 degrees. The angle is created by making two equal bevels on opposite sides of the blade. For instance, a 25-degree angle is formed by sharpening to a 12.5-degree bevel on either side of the blade edge. This can be done with a belt sander, grinding wheel, or mill file.</p> <p>To sharpen with a file, clamp the blade into a vice at the desired angle and push the file across the blade, and then turn the blade over and repeat on the opposite side. The process for sharpening with a belt sander or grinding wheel is similar, but the machete is held to the belt or wheel instead of being clamped in a vice.</p>",345
719,chipper shredder,"<p>If you’re in the market for your first chipper shredder, you likely have some questions. Read on for answers that will help you shop wisely.</p> <h3>Q. What is a chipper shredder?</h3> <p>It’s a landscaping tool that shreds dry wood and plant waste to be recycled as mulch or compost or discarded.</p> <h3>Q.

721,compost tumbler,"<p>New to composting? Keep reading to learn more about using and maintaining your new compost tumbler.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a compost tumbler?</h3> <p>Set up the compost tumbler in a sunny location to promote quick growth of composting microbes. Fill it (either all at once or over several weeks) with a mix of kitchen scraps, shredded newspaper, garden debris, grass clippings, fallen leaves, and other scraps. Moisten the mixture (it should feel like a not-quite-saturated sponge) and close the lid.</p> <p>Rotate the bin two or three times per week. After a week, the ingredients should be warm to the touch, with no foul odors. Continue rotating the bin two to three times per week and inspect the contents weekly. The temperature will continue to get warmer as the material breaks down, and it will gradually cool as more and more of the material completes the decomposition process.</p> <p>Add water as needed to maintain the moisture level. When it’s cool and appears dark and crumbly with no recognizable particles, the material is completely processed and ready to use.</p> <h3>Q: How long does it take to make compost in a tumbler?</h3> <p>The time it takes to make compost varies, depending on the temperature, time of year, and the balance of the ingredients inside. It’s possible to have compost within less than 10 weeks if all the right conditions come together.</p> <h3>Q: How often do you need to turn a compost tumbler?</h3> <p>For fastest processing and to eliminate odors, turn the compost tumbler two to three times per week.</p> <h3>Q: How often should you water compost?</h3> <p>The compost should have the feel of a gently wrung-out sponge. As the material is processed and builds heat, moisture evaporates. Check the bin weekly and add water as needed.</p>",294
722,backpack leaf blower,"<p>If you’re still unsure about whether a backpack leaf blower is right for you, continue reading. Ahead you’ll find answers to commonly asked questions about using backpack leaf blowers.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a backpack leaf blower?</h3> <p>To pile up debris such as fallen leaves, start by determining where the pile should be. Then walk to the distant edge of the area and use a low, steady sweeping motion to move the leaves toward the pile. Aiming the air tube across the top of the debris keeps it low to the ground. To dislodge matted, wet leaves, aim the tube low and force air beneath it.</p> <h3>Q: Do backpack leaf blowers work on wet leaves?</h3> <p>Yes. The higher the cfm rating, the more effectively the blower moves wet leaves.</p> <h3>Q: Are backpack leaf blowers better than handheld ones?</h3> <p>On average, backpack leaf blowers are more powerful than handheld blowers. They also have the advantage of reducing operator fatigue by transferring the weight of the machine to larger core muscles in the body.</p> <h3>Q: Which is more important for a leaf blower, cfm or mph?</h3> <p>Between cfm and mph, cfm is more important, as it measures the volume of air that moves through the machine. Think of it this way: Tornadoes have faster wind speeds, but hurricanes do more damage.</p>",220
723,smoker,"<p>Smoking is a fun way to cook, and the time you put into it pays off. But as with any new endeavor, novice smokers probably have a lot of questions. Peruse our frequently asked questions section to get the answers you need before purchasing a smoker.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between an electric and a regular smoker?</h3> <p>A regular smoker uses charcoal to cook the meat and create smoke from the wood chips to flavor the meat. Electric smokers use electric heating elements to cook the meat and create smoke from the wood chips to flavor the meat.</p> <h3>Q: How do I use a smoker to cook meat?</h3> <p>Smokers use a variety of methods to generate a heat of about 275 degrees Fahrenheit. The juiciest, smokiest barbecued meats are achieved by cooking them over low heat for a long period of time.</p> <h3>Q:How do I season my smoker?</h3> <p>For best results, spray the inside of your smoker with cooking oil (grapeseed or canola oil work great), and heat at a high temperature for a few hours before you put your first cut of meat inside.</p> <h3>Q:How long does it take for wood chips to start smoking?</h3> <p>It takes about 20 minutes after adding the wood chips before they start smoking enough to produce flavor.</p> <h3>Q: How long does charcoal burn in a smoker?</h3> <p>When used in a smoker, charcoal burns slowly for a long time. A 15-pound bag of charcoal can burn for up to 15 hours inside the firebox, which is usually plenty of time to smoke most meats.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use wood in a charcoal smoker?</h3> <p>Yes, in fact, it’s a good idea to use wood in a charcoal smoker. Using different types of wood, such as hickory or cherry, creates different flavors in the meat. Just make sure to mix the wood with the best charcoal for smoking instead of adding wood alone to ensure a long burn time. An ash pan is also a good idea to help collect the ashes as the wood burns.</p>",341
724,gas leaf blower,"<p>If some questions still remain about leaf blowers, keep reading to find a list of the most frequently asked questions and answers. Reach out to the leaf blower’s manufacturer and speak with a customer service representative with additional questions.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for when buying a leaf blower? </h3> <p>Look for a balance of airflow, weight, and usability. A handheld blower that produces 140 or more mph and weighs less than 11 pounds is the sweet spot.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best CFM for a leaf blower? </h3> <p>CFM depends on the size of the yard, the weight the user is comfortable carrying, and budget. However, a blower with less than 300 CFM frustrates most users, so use that figure as the benchmark when shopping.</p> <h3>Q. Do leaf blowers take regular gas?</h3> <p>Yes and no. Four-stroke engines take regular gas that you don’t need to mix with oil, but many prefer 89 octane. Two-stroke engines use regular gas mixed with two-stroke oil.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a leaf blower effectively?</h3> <p>Plan where you want the leaves to land. Spread out a tarp and hold the corners down with stones. Holding the blower at the side, tilt the nozzle at a slight angle toward the ground in front of you. Sweep back and forth until all the leaves are on the tarp.</p> <h3>Q. How long do gas leaf blowers last?</h3> <p>If the leaf blower is maintained, it can last up to 10 years. This means changing the oil, cleaning the air filter, and winterizing it at the start of cold weather on a regular basis.</p>",264
725,outdoor thermometer,"<p>Tracking temperatures lets you plan your outdoor activities, take better care of a garden and yard, and dress for the weather. However, there are a few tricks to their use and setup, so there may be a few lingering questions. Below are answers to some of the most popular questions about outdoor thermometers for the home.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know that my outdoor thermometer is accurate?</h3> <p>Perform an ice-point or boiling-point test. The ice-point test involves putting the sensor or probe in a cup of ice water. It should display 32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius. The boiling-point test works the same way. Boil a pot of water and place the thermometer’s probe in the water. Then, compare the readings to the known boiling point of your altitude. Keep in mind that altitude and air pressure can alter the freezing and boiling points.</p> <h3>Q. Can you adjust an outdoor thermometer?</h3> <p>Outdoor thermometers can usually be calibrated to make sure they’re providing accurate readings. With some, you may simply adjust the dial to match the results of an ice-point or boil-point test. Digital models may offer a way to adjust the readings according to an ice-point test, or they may have a reset button that calibrates the thermometer back to digital settings.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best place to put my outdoor thermometer?</h3> <p>Try to place the thermometer somewhere where the readings won’t be altered by landscaping, the sun, or the weather. For example, it should be between 4 and 6 feet off the ground and at least 20 feet from concrete. Concrete reflects heat, causing the temperature to rise.</p> <p>Outdoor thermometers and sensors don’t belong in full sun. Direct sunlight can cause higher temperature readings that don’t match the actual air temperature. Finally, try to place the thermometer where it has a degree of protection from rain.</p>",309

737,electric tiller,"<p>Still want more info about electric tillers? Discover answers to several of the most frequently asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a tiller and a cultivator?</h3> <p>Cultivators, usually smaller than tillers, are primarily designed to mix and loosen shallow sections of soil that have been tilled previously. Tillers, on the other hand, break up larger sections of harder soil. Tillers aid in creating new garden beds, while cultivators help prepare existing beds for planting.</p> <h3>Q. What is a tiller’s tilling capacity?</h3> <p>The tilling capacity of an electric garden tiller refers to how deep and wide it can till. It’s a measure of the tiller’s width, depth, and power rating.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a tiller to remove grass?</h3> <p>It’s not the best choice because it cannot get the entire job done. Ideally, to remove established lawn grass, rent a sod cutter for large areas, or for smaller portions of grass, use a garden spade to slice the roots beneath the surface. A heavy-duty gas-powered tiller can partially remove grass by freeing the roots from the soil and breaking large sections of sod into smaller chunks. Unfortunately, you’ll still have to remove the smaller chunks with a rake or a shovel.</p> <h3>Q. Do I push or pull a tiller?</h3> <p>Walk-behind tillers, both electric and gas, are designed to work in a forward direction. Attempting to pull them backward can lead to injury. The forward rotation of the tines usually provides adequate forward momentum, so it is normally not necessary to push the machine. Depending on soil conditions, it may be necessary to rock the machine forward or hold back on forward momentum for best results.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best mini tiller?</h3> <p>One of the best options is the Black+Decker 20V Max Cordless Garden Cultivator, which weighs under 12 pounds and reaches a tilling width of up to 7 inches.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most powerful electric tiller?</h3> <p>With its large 13.5-amp motor, the Earthwise TC70016 Corded Electric Tiller/Cultivator is one of the most powerful models on the market.</p>",341

739,polymeric sand,"<p>Still have questions about polymeric sand? Here are answers to commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between jointing sand and polymeric sand? </h3> <p>Both sands lock pavers in place, but polymeric sand has water-activated additives and adhesives that create a stronger bond.</p> <h3>Q: How does polymeric sand work? </h3> <p>Polymeric sand is a mixture of sand, adhesive, and sometimes Portland cement. Once pushed into the joints, water activates the adhesive, making the grains of sand bond together, as well as to the pavers, to create a durable surface.</p> <h3>Q: Can water drain through a polymeric sand?</h3> <p>Polymeric sand will allow a small amount of water to drain, but most water will run off a properly installed paver surface with polymeric sand.</p> <h3>Q: How long does polymeric sand last? </h3> <p>Polymeric sand can last up to 10 years before replacement is necessary. However, certain manufacturers claim some products can last up to 15 years.</p>",152
740,lightweight garden hose,"<p>After reading about some of the top lightweight garden hoses, some questions may linger about hose length, thickness, and expected life span. Below are answers to some of the most common questions about lightweight garden hoses.</p> <h3>Q: Does hose length affect water pressure?</h3> <p>Yes, hose length affects water pressure. The longer the hose, the more friction and drag the water must overcome as it travels down the length of the hose. This length can reduce the water pressure.</p> <h3>Q: Is hose thickness important?</h3> <p>The thickness of the hose also can impact water pressure. As thickness increases, it can cause the diameter of the hose to become smaller, which will reduce the water pressure from the hose.</p> <h3>Q: How long will my lightweight garden hose last?</h3> <p>A lightweight garden hose typically lasts between 5 to 10 years.</p>",136
741,push mower,"<p>Even with all this background in how to find the best push mower, some questions may still remain. The following section is a collection of answers to the most frequently asked questions about push mowers.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for in a push mower? </h3> <p>Although preferences vary, most people prefer a model with plenty of power, a bagger attachment, large wheels (if the yard has some rougher terrain), and adjustable cutting heights.</p> <h3>Q. What is a good horsepower for a lawn mower? </h3> <p>Manufacturers are moving away from horsepower ratings; instead, look for a gas-powered push mower with a 140cc or larger engine, a battery-operated model with 36V or more battery and motor, and an 11 amp or greater corded electric motor.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain my push mower? </h3> <p>Clean the underside of any mower’s deck with a hose and sharpen its blades from time to time. If it’s a gasoline-powered mower, change the spark plug and air filter once a year. Also remember to winterize the fuel system before the winter by adding a fuel treatment.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my push mower last? </h3> <p>The average push mower can last for 8 to 10 years. Electric mowers probably last the longest, as they have the simplest motors and mechanisms. Batteries could fail on cordless models, and replacing the battery if it’s no longer available may be difficult.</p>",229
742,watering wand,"<p>Upgrade your plain old hose nozzle to a watering wand. These gardening tools create a gentle shower to more conveniently spray outdoor plants. If you’re on the hunt for a new watering tool, consider the following frequently asked questions and answers about the best watering wands.</p> <h3>Q. Why use a watering wand?</h3> <p>A watering wand is an affordable tool that makes watering more convenient and better for your plants. Wand heads create a softer and more diffuse spray than regular spray nozzles. The rain-like spray won’t damage fragile growth. They also provide a further reach to make it easier to water at the bottom of plants or reach hanging baskets without crouching or getting a stepladder.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I water my garden?</h3> <p>One to two watering sessions a week is sufficient for most gardens, but frequency depends on weather and the type of plant. During peak heat or wind, plants dry out faster. Container plants also can dry out more quickly than those growing in the ground.</p> <h3>Q. Where should I store my watering wand?</h3> <p>It is best to store a watering wand indoors, like in a shed or garage. Ideally, store the wand out of areas with vast temperature changes or direct sunlight, both of which can wear down or break plastic parts.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my watering wand last?</h3> <p>A high-quality watering wand can last for many years, keeping your garden green and lush through several growing seasons.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

743,lawn tractor battery,"<p>If questions remain about choosing or maintaining a lawn tractor battery, keep reading to find answers to provide more important information about these batteries.</p> <h3>Q. Are all lawn tractor batteries the same?</h3> <p>While all lawn tractor batteries are 12 volt, they come in different sizes, which means not all are compatible with every tractor. Some, but not all, feature advanced technologies that give them better durability than other batteries.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a lawn tractor battery?</h3> <p>First and foremost, make sure that the battery’s dimensions are compatible with the lawn tractor. Try to match the dimensions of the old battery as closely as possible with the new one.</p> <h3>Q. Why does my lawn tractor battery keep dying?</h3> <p>The plates in the battery may be degraded, preventing the battery from holding a charge. The battery’s alternator, the device that recharges the battery when the engine is running, may not be working properly.</p> <h3>Q. How do you revive a dead lawn tractor battery?</h3> <p>The simplest way to revive a dead lawn tractor battery is to use a charger to recharge it for several hours.</p> <h3>Q. How can I store lawn tractor batteries in winter?</h3> <p>Freezing temperatures can cause a lawn tractor battery to discharge.

To prevent this from happening, store a lawn tractor battery in a space that never falls below freezing or gets hotter than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, such as a basement.</p> <h3>Q. How long should a lawn tractor battery last?</h3> <p>Most lawn tractor batteries will last about 3 years before requiring a replacement.</p>",275
744,cordless lawn mower,"<p>Now that you’re armed with a lot of new information about choosing the best cordless lawn mower, some additional questions might be sprouting up like dandelions. The following section is a collection of the most frequently asked questions and answers about cordless lawn mowers.</p> <h3>Q: How is a cordless lawn mower started?</h3> <p>Almost all cordless lawn mowers feature a push-button start or a key switch, allowing for incredibly easy starts.</p> <h3>Q: How long do cordless lawn mowers last on a single charge?</h3> <p>Most of the best cordless lawn mowers feature runtimes between 45 minutes and an hour, with a few rare models lasting up to 90 minutes.</p> <h3>Q: Do cordless lawn mowers need oil?</h3> <p>Cordless lawn mowers are very low maintenance, and they don’t require any oil or gasoline.</p>",129
745,pump sprayer,"<p>If you’re wondering about the range of your new pump sprayer, the applications for which you can use it, or how to maintain it, then read on for answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about these handy gardening tools.</p> <h3>Q. How far will a pump sprayer spray?</h3> <p>The range of a pump sprayer depends on the spray pattern. It will spray the farthest when set to a narrow stream. Most pump sprayers can spray up to 20 feet, and some more powerful sprayers are capable of reaching 30 feet.</p> <h3>Q. What do I do if my pump sprayer gets clogged?</h3> <p>If your pump sprayer gets clogged, it’s likely because sediment or dirt has become lodged in the sprayer’s nozzle. Remove the nozzle and clean it with water using a hose. Then, replace the nozzle.</p> <h3>Q. Are pump sprayers safe to use for painting?</h3> <p>It’s not suggested. The types of sprayers used to paint cabinets, trim, and other surfaces are usually pressurized by air compressors that maintain a steady paint pressure. An airless sprayer is better suited for painting. Rather than attempting to spray-paint with a pump sprayer, consider rolling on the paint.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean my pump sprayer?</h3> <p>To clean your pump sprayer, begin by rinsing out the tank with fresh water. Once clean, fill the tank with fresh water and then assemble the sprayer. Spray fresh water through the tube and nozzle to clean any chemicals out of it. Remove the nozzle and rinse it using a hose.</p> <h3>Q. Are pump sprayers effective for spraying pests?</h3> <p>Yes. Pump sprayers are a good option for applying pest control. However, they tend to distribute liquids at a high volume, so they may be unsuitable for indoor use.</p> <h3>Q. Are pump sprayers safe around my pets and children?</h3> <p>Pump sprayers themselves do not produce enough force—significantly less than a garden hose—to pose a threat to pets and children. That said, most of the time, these sprayers are spraying toxic chemicals, so keep children and pets away when using them.</p> <h3>Q. What precautions should I take when using a pump sprayer?</h3> <p>Wear gloves and goggles to protect the skin and eyes from the dangerous chemicals the pump sprayer distributes. Use the wand’s length to help you maintain a safe distance from the nozzle, and spray downwind to prevent the chemicals from being blown back at you.</p>",398
746,pressure washer surface cleaner,"<p>Even with all of the above information about the best pressure washer surface cleaners, you may have some additional questions. This section aims to answer some of the most frequently asked questions about pressure washer surface cleaners.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use hot water with a pressure washer surface cleaner?</h3> <p>Pro-grade and some semipro-grade pressure washer surface cleaners can handle hot tap water.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a surface cleaner on fences or walls?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use certain surface cleaners on walls, fences, and, in some cases, even houses. But for vertical surfaces, it’s easier if the model is lightweight. Also, make sure to dial back the pressure.</p> <h3>Q. Will water consumption increase when I use a surface cleaner attachment?</h3> <p>Pressure washer surface cleaners are more efficient than washing a driveway by wand alone. They reduce the amount of water required to clean a surface properly.</p> <h3>Q. Does a surface cleaner require heavy maintenance?</h3> <p>Most semipro and consumer-grade pressure washers are relatively maintenance-free. Simply ensure that they’re clean after each use. Pro-grade models with grease fittings also require cleaning, but topping off the bearings with grease every 10 to 12 hours is necessary.</p> <h3>Q. Will a pressure washer surface cleaner lower my machine’s cleaning power?</h3> <p>Pressure washer surface cleaners do not hinder the cleaning power of a pressure washer as long as the product selected is compatible with the machine. Selecting the best pressure washer surface cleaner starts with matching the product to your machine. Check the manufacturer specifications on both to ensure an accurate match.</p>",256
747,oil for lawn mower,"<p>The information above should have left you better informed about how to choose the best oil for lawn-mower maintenance. While important technical and performance issues were covered, there are a few practical considerations that may raise questions. Here are a few answers to the most common questions about lawn-mower oil.</p> <h3>Q. How often should the oil be changed?</h3> <p>Two-stroke oil changes constantly because it’s mixed with the gasoline, so there’s no need to worry with that type of mower. Four-stroke mowers need more regular attention, and there is a useful article on maintenance here. It suggests keeping an eye on oil level and topping up periodically. A full change is usually only necessary once per season or for small mowers every 50 hours. For riding mowers, an oil change every 100 hours is recommended.</p> <h3>Q. How do I change the oil in the lawn mower?</h3> <p>Instructions will be provided with your new mower and should be followed carefully. Generally there’s a drain plug in the crankcase which is removed, and the old oil is collected in a tray or a pan. Tipping the mower will help ensure it’s empty. Larger mowers may have an oil filter that needs to be replaced. Once that’s done, replace the drain plug and fill with the required quantity of new oil.</p> <h3>Q. How much oil should I use for a lawn mower?</h3> <p>The manufacturer will recommend the quantity, and it’s important to be as accurate as possible. Overfilling can cause as much harm as underfilling. Using a plastic measuring jug is a good idea. Small mowers take anywhere from 15 to 24 ounces of oil, while riding mowers will need 48 to 64 ounces.</p> <h3>Q. Is there any difference between a four-cycle oil and a regular one?</h3> <p>“Regular oil” is usually a term associated with those made from crude oil rather than synthetics. Both four-cycle and two-cycle oils come in either form. The information above should help you decide which is best for your lawn mower.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use my motor vehicle engine oil in my lawn mower?</h3> <p>Often you can use motor oil on large ride-on mowers and older machines. It’s important to check manufacturer recommendations. For walk-behind models, it’s usually better to use small engine lawn-mower oils which are specifically formulated for the performance of these types of motors.</p> <h3>Q. What happens if I don’t change my lawn-mower oil?</h3> <p>Dirt and carbon will accumulate in the oil, causing a higher wear rate of engine components. The oil itself will degrade and the engine will overheat, which can result in engine failure or it may dramatically shorten the life of the mower.</p>",440
748,gas lawn mower,"<p>For questions about lawn mower longevity, maintenance, and/or storage, read on—plus get answers to other common questions about the best gas lawn mowers.</p> <h3>Q: How long do gas lawn mowers last?</h3> <p>A gas lawn mower will last between 8 and 10 years if properly maintained. How often the mower is used, how long it takes to mow the lawn, and even how hard the mower must work to cut the grass can impact its lifespan.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best gas to use in a lawn mower?</h3> <p>Unleaded gasoline with a minimum of 87 octane is the best gas to use for a lawn mower engine. While higher-octane gas won’t hurt an engine, there is no benefit to using this more expensive gasoline.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain a gas lawn mower?</h3> <p>Unless the mower doesn’t require oil changes, make sure to change the oil regularly. Most lawn mower manufacturers recommend doing this at the start of the mowing season. Clean and replace air filters to prevent debris from clogging the engine, replace the spark plug annually, and use a gas stabilizer before storing the mower for the off-season. Finally, periodically flip the mower over to remove built-up grass clippings.</p> <h3>Q: Are gas lawn mowers safe?</h3> <p>When used properly, gas lawn mowers are as safe as other types of lawn mowers. All gas mowers have a safety feature, sometimes referred to as a dead man’s switch, that prevents the blade from operating unless the operator is holding a bar on the handle closed.</p> <h3>Q: Do all gas lawn mowers come with bags?</h3> <p>While most walk-behind gas mowers come with bags, not all do. Models designed for mowing smaller areas may not include bags. Riding mowers often offer an optional bagging system sold separately.</p> <h3>Q: How do I store a gas lawn mower for winter?</h3> <p>To winterize a lawn mower, leave the gas tank empty. Drain the engine oil, then refill it with fresh oil. Store the mower in a dry, well-protected place that is away from a water heater or furnace.</p>",341

For tough terrain with thick grass, a larger engine is usually a better choice.</p> <h3>Q. Can I replace the pull cord on a lawn mower?</h3> <p>Yes. In fact, replacing the pull cord on a mower is a fairly simple repair, requiring just a screwdriver and wrench.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a lawn mower’s battery last?</h3> <p>As a general rule of thumb, a riding lawn mower’s battery can last about 4 years. The rechargeable battery on an electric mower can last about 5 years.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean my lawn mower?</h3> <p>To clean a mower, tip the mower over to access the deck. Remove any grass clippings or debris that may be wrapped around the blade or stuck to the bottom of the deck. Wet the deck with a garden hose, then spray the underside with an all-purpose cleaner. Scrub the deck with a brush, then rinse thoroughly. Turn the mower back upright and use a damp rag or paper towel to wipe down the housing.</p> <h3>Q. How often do I need to change spark plugs in my lawn mower?</h3> <p>Change the spark plugs in the spring at the beginning of the mowing season or after 100 hours of use.</p>",280
750,dump carts for lawn tractors,"<p>After reviewing our recommendations and suggested shopping criteria, questions may linger about buying a new dump cart. The following are some of the most commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. Are dump carts hard to assemble/put together?</h3> <p>Home assembly is required for most dump carts. Putting together a dump cart typically requires basic hand tools, such as wrenches, sockets, hex keys, and pliers. The total time required averages around an hour.</p> <h3>Q. How do you hook up a dump cart to a tractor?</h3> <p>Most dump carts attach to the lawn tractor by a drop pin. The pin looks something like a bolt with no threads. As the name suggests, it’s dropped down through aligned holes in the trailer tongue and tractor hitch.</p> <h3>Q. Do I have to grease the wheels of my new dump cart before I use it?</h3> <p>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions. As a general rule, if grease fittings are present, you should grease them. Some dump carts have sealed bearings, which need no grease.</p> <h3>Q. What is the pressure requirement for dump cart wheels?</h3> <p>Each kind of tire is different and comes with its own instructions. Inflate the tires on your dump cart to the maximum pressure indicated on the sidewall of the tires.</p> <h3>Q. Can dump carts for lawn tractors withstand tough terrains?</h3> <p>Lawn tractor dump carts that are designated “heavy-duty” or “hybrid” (meaning they may be used with either lawn tractors or ATVs) are built with sturdier frames, tubs, wheels, and tires. Pay special attention to the frame material and tires. Tubular steel or square steel framing and wide, multi-ply rubber tires are usually best.</p> <h3>Q. How long do dump carts last?</h3> <p>With average care and storage while not in use, a dump cart can last 20 to 30 years or longer. To maximize its lifespan, monitor tire condition and pressure, grease the fittings once or twice a year, and don’t overload it.</p>",315
751,mulching lawn mowers,"<p>If you’re wondering how mulching can help improve the health of your yard or whether you need to equip your mower with a special blade, read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. What does mulching do for your lawn?</h3> <p>Mulching returns nutrients to your lawn in the form of grass clippings, which helps feed it.</p> <h3>Q. Is it better to mulch or bag when mowing?</h3> <p>Most of the time, mulching is the best option as it returns nutrients to your lawn and doesn’t create yard waste. However, bagging is the best option if the grass is tall or covered in leaves.</p> <h3>Q. Do you need special mowing blades to mulch grass?</h3> <p>Most lawn mowers come with blades suitable for mulching or bagging grass. Users typically do not need a special blade for mulching.</p> <h3>Q. Will a mulching mower put decorative strips on my lawn like on TV?</h3> <p>You can use a mulching mower to create decorative stripes on your lawn. But, as with any mower, you’ll need a lawn roller to achieve the striped look you see on a Major League Baseball field.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a mulching lawn mower last?</h3> <p>Most lawn mowers last for about 10 years, although that depends on how often you use it and how well you maintain it.</p> <h3>Q. What is “thatch”?</h3> <p>In yards, thatch is a layer of organic material that collects around the base of the grass blades that</p> <p>can prevent new grass from growing. When thatch becomes too thick, the lawn must be dethatched by raking it out or using a dethatcher. Contrary to popular belief, mulching a lawn does not contribute to additional thatch.</p>",280
752,zero turn mowers for five acres,"<p>If you’ve made it this far, you may have additional questions. Read on for answers to common concerns.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for in a machine that can mow 5 acres?</h3> <p>To mow 5 acres of grass without having to dedicate an entire day, look for a mower with a 60-inch deck with three blades, a 24-horsepower engine, and a fast mowing speed of at least 6 miles per hour. A machine like that should do the job in 1.5 hours or less.</p> <h3>Q. What is a zero-turn grass mower?</h3> <p>Zero-turn mowers feature independently controlled drive wheels in the back and swivel caster wheels up front. They are capable of pivoting or turning in place without driving around in a circle. This maneuverability helps them to navigate smoothly around landscape obstacles. These machines also travel at twice the speed of conventional lawn tractors.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a zero-turn mower at my home?</h3> <p>Zero-turn mowers are most effective when mowing lawns a half-acre and larger. They excel where there is lots of grass with obstacles like trees but few dead ends or bottlenecks (such as gates) to navigate. Most zero-turn mowers do not perform well—or safely—on steep slopes.</p> <h3>Q. How do I steer a zero-turn mower?</h3> <p>Movement is controlled by the two hand levers, and it becomes intuitive after a short practice session. When you first sit down, the levers are separated in the “park” position. Bring the levers together over your lap to the “neutral” position. Push them both forward or backward to move forward or backward. To turn right, push forward on the left side lever. To turn left, push forward on the right side lever. To pivot, push forward on either side while pulling back on the other.</p> <h3>Q. Are zero-turn mowers efficient on hills?</h3> <p>Most zero-turn mowers are not as efficient or safe for use on hills. Larger, heavier machines are more stable, but they should be equipped with a rollover protection system (ROPS). Steep hills increase the risk of rolling the mower over. Consult the manufacturer’s specifications for gradient maximums before purchasing any zero-turn mower for hilly terrain.</p> <h3>Q. How do I pull a zero-turn mower?</h3> <p>When towing a zero-turn mower on a trailer behind a vehicle, remember that the heaviest part of the mower is at the rear. Load the mower by backing it onto the trailer. Be sure the mower is centered and the rear wheels of the mower are slightly forward of the trailer axle. Once everything is well balanced, strap it down.</p>",422
753,riding lawn mowers for 1 acre,"<p>If you’re searching for a new riding lawn mower, you may have lingering questions about the best mower for your property. Read on for answers to a few common questions asked by other shoppers.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for when buying a riding lawn mower?</h3> <p>Determine the type of riding mower that best fits your needs: lawn tractor, zero-turn mower, or rear-engine riding mower. Consider the engine power, deck size, and mowing speed. For one acre, most users prefer the performance of 17 to 22 horsepower, 42- to 46-inch deck, and travel speed of 4 to 5 mph for lawn tractors, or 7 mph for zero-turn mowers.</p> <h3>Q. What size mower is best for 1 acre?</h3> <p>The most popular deck size of mower for an acre is 42 inches. However, a wider deck, up to 54 inches, could be a great choice if the space is wide open and relatively flat.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take to cut 1 acre of grass?</h3> <p>Most lawn tractors equipped with a 42-inch deck can mow an acre in about 36 minutes. Mowing speed in acres per hour (APH) is calculated by factoring the deck size and travel speed. A mower with a 42-inch deck, averaging 4.5 miles per hour, can cut 1.7 acres per hour. Change the deck size to 46 inches and the acres per hour increases to nearly 1.9.</p> <p>For the most accurate calculation, use this formula: APH = (MW/12) (MS x 5,280) / 43,560 x 0.9</p> <p>APH Acres per hour</p> <p>MW Mower width</p> <p>MS Mower speed</p> <p>5,280 feet in a mile</p> <p>43,560 square feet in an acre</p> <h3>Q. What is a good horsepower for a lawn mower?</h3> <p>For a 1-acre lawn, choose a lawn tractor with between 17 and 24 horsepower, or a zero-turn mower with between 20 and 25 horsepower.</p> <h3>Q. How do you transport a riding mower?</h3> <p>Load the mower onto the trailer or into the truck bed with the engine toward the front of the vehicle. On a trailer, position the engine in front of the trailer axles. Set the mower’s parking brake. Tie down the mower front and back to anchor points in the truck bed or trailer bed with ratchet straps.</p>",368

Find the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about riding lawn mowers below so you can feel confident that you select the best riding lawn mower for your home.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a riding lawn mower?</h3> <p>In order to find the right gas or electric riding lawn mower for your home or business, consider the type of mower, the fuel or battery capacity, the deck size, and the size of the lawn. Not every home needs a premium zero-turn riding mower with a 72-inch deck to mow the lawn once a week, but if you do have 3 or 4 acres of grass that needs to be cut, then a large deck can help get the job done. Don’t forget to factor in any safety features and consider whether the type of transmission or wheels the mower uses are suitable for the terrain.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take to mow a 2-acre lawn?</h3> <p>The time it takes to mow a 2-acre lawn depends on the type of lawn mower and the size of the deck. On average, small riding mowers will take about 30 minutes to 2 hours, while large zero-turn mowers may be able to complete the job in just 20 to 30 minutes.</p> <h3>Q. How long should a riding mower last?</h3> <p>The lifespan of a riding mower depends on the quality of the mower and on the level of care and maintenance over the years. Cheap riding lawn mowers may only last about 10 years, but the best riding lawn mower for 1 acre of lawn could last for up to 20 years if it is properly maintained.</p> <h3>Q. How many acres can a lawn tractor mow?</h3> <p>A lawn tractor can mow about 1 to 3 acres per hour, depending on the type and deck size. For instance, a small riding lawn mower or lawn tractor could mow about 1 to 2 acres in an hour, but a zero-turn lawn tractor with a wide cutting deck could cut more than 3 acres in the same amount of time.</p> <h3>Q. How do I get more power out of my riding mower?</h3> <p>It isn’t recommended to tamper with your lawn mower unless you are already experienced with small engine repair, but you can increase the power output of your riding mower by unscrewing the flywheel housing and then removing the governor flap in the engine before replacing the flywheel housing. Additionally, if you feel as though your riding lawn mower isn’t running at the normal power level, inspect the muffler for any cracks or holes, which can reduce horsepower.

763,outdoor wood sealers,"<p>It’s beneficial to have detailed information about wood sealers to understand why it’s recommended to seal outdoor wood products. Learn more below by reading the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about outdoor wood sealers.</p> <h3>Q. Why do I need to seal my wood?</h3> <p>The intention behind sealing outdoor wooden objects is to prevent moisture from entering the wood, causing it to swell, warp, and rot. Outdoor sealers create a waterproof layer that bonds to the wood to repel moisture.</p> <h3>Q. Should I seal all sides of wood?</h3> <p>You should seal all sides of a board or a piece of furniture, especially if all sides will be visible. Wooden objects that are installed or used outdoors should be completely sealed to help protect the item from rain, snow, and moisture. However, you don’t have to seal all sides if the wooden object is set up indoors and the bottom is largely unseen.</p> <h3>Q. How long does exterior wood sealer last?</h3> <p>On average, exterior wood sealer is made to last for about 4 to 5 years, though it may begin to show signs of wear before this point, especially if the sealant was not properly applied. Always make sure to read and follow the manufacturer’s directions for use to get the best results.</p> <h3>Q. Will outdoor wood sealer withstand harsh weather conditions? </h3> <p>The main purpose of outdoor wood sealer is to create a waterproof layer that bonds to the exterior of the wood. Some sealants will also provide UV protection, though this is primarily reliant on the transparency of the product. With this in mind, wood sealers can protect fences, decks, or wood furniture from rain, sleet, and snow, though it does nothing to help with hail or strong winds, which can physically damage the wood.</p> <h3>Q. Can I paint sealed wood?</h3> <p>It isn’t recommended to paint over sealed wood because sealants are specifically designed to seal out moisture. This means that paint or stain will not adhere to the wood, resulting in bubbling, flaking, and chipping.</p>",339

The snow blower attachment can be removed and replaced with other attachments.</p> <h3>Q. Do lawn mower snow blowers work?</h3> <p>They do work. Unlike electric snow blowers, which use batteries or outlet power, or traditional snow blowers that have their own gas engines, lawn mower snow blowers run off the tractor’s engine. By removing the mower deck and replacing it with a snow blower attachment, the snow blower draws power from the tractor or lawn mower’s engine to operate the auger.</p> <p>In some cases, the snow blower may attach to a PTO (power take-off). Regardless of the method, they turn tractors and mowers into sit-down snow blowers.</p> <h3>Q. Is it possible to make a snow blower from an existing lawn mower?</h3> <p>Yes. Some lawn mower snow blower combo models are universal, allowing them to attach to existing lawn mowers. Otherwise, simply search for a snow blower that fits your model number.</p> <h3>Q.

Wooden hammock stands can last much longer if appropriately maintained with an outdoor sealer.</p> <h3>Q: What can I do to prolong the life of my hammock stand?</h3> <p>Metal hammock stands are most likely to rust from the inside, so be sure to keep any exposed opening covered or plugged if possible. Also, disassemble the stand and bring it in each winter (spraying some WD-40 or similar rust-preventing spray into the tubes will help). For wood stands, be sure to sand and seal them each year to get the most life out of them.</p>",310

These will help you get your lights up, running, and looking their best this holiday season.</p> <h3>Q. What length should outdoor Christmas string lights be?</h3> <p>The light string should be slightly longer than the area in which they’re hung. That extra length puts them closer to the electrical outlet and reduces the length of any needed extension cords.</p> <h3>Q. How should I hang outdoor Christmas lights?</h3> <p>Recruit a helper, get a sturdy ladder, and get ready for a few hours of work. Start with a string near an electrical outlet, and hang the lights by following the roofline. Have your helper hold the ladder for stability. Some people hang lights from nails, others use a staple gun, while others use removable light clips. Of these options, the removable clips offer the easiest and least damaging method.</p> <h3>Q. How waterproof are outdoor Christmas lights?</h3> <p>Outdoor Christmas lights should be 100 percent waterproof. If they’re not, they could short out the first time it rains or snows. Check the IP rating. The IP rating has two numbers. The first number indicates dust and debris resistance, and the second indicates water resistance on a scale of 0 to 9.

The light displays best on a flat surface, which a tree is not. However, moving light displays can make a tree look like it’s lit because the light continually catches the branches.</p> <h3>Q. How do I set up a Christmas light projector?</h3> <p>First, read the manufacturer’s instructions, and then follow them. Depending on the projector’s specs, you may need a measuring tape to determine the optimum distance from the display area. From there, it’s a matter of adjusting the projector angle, securing it, and plugging in an extension cord.</p> <h3>Q. At what distance should I install a Christmas light projector?</h3> <p>The appropriate distance varies from model to model. Some models project best between 15 and 20 feet from the display area, while others display best at 30 to 40 feet. Check the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p> <h3>Q. On what surface can the Christmas light project the image?</h3> <p>Christmas light projectors provide the best images on a relatively flat surface, like a house, garage door, or interior wall.</p>",290

How do I replace LED lights on Christmas inflatables?</h3> <p>LED lights should last for years before burning out, but if you find yourself having to replace a bulb on your Christmas inflatable, first establish the bulb size and style and purchase an appropriate replacement. If the entire lighting system stops working, replacing it requires some electrical know-how. A simpler solution is to simply add an outdoor spotlight to illuminate your inflatable.</p> <h3>Q. Can Christmas inflatables get wet?</h3> <p>Christmas inflatables are designed for outdoor use, so they’re water resistant.</p> <h3>Q. Are Christmas inflatables OK in the snow?</h3> <p>Since they’re intended for outdoor winter use, most Christmas inflatables can withstand snow and freezing temperatures. Check the manufacturer’s instructions, however, because they may recommend bringing the inflatable inside at a certain temperature.</p> <h3>Q. Do Christmas inflatables use a lot of electricity?</h3> <p>Don’t worry about your electricity bill skyrocketing because of your Christmas inflatables; a 6-foot inflatable used for 24 hours a day for the entire month of December would only add about $5 to your bill.</p>",267

777,gas grills under 1000,"<p>If you’re wondering when’s the best time to get a great deal on a gas grill or why natural gas grills carry a premium price, keep reading for answers to these and other commonly asked questions about these outdoor appliances.</p> <h3>Q: When is the best time to buy a gas grill? </h3> <p>The best time to get a deal on a gas grill is in the fall when demand for outdoor cooking appliances begins to drop.</p> <h3>Q: Why are natural gas grills, on average, more expensive? </h3> <p>Price has to do with the fact that natural gas grills are more expensive to build. A propane grill includes a 2-foot hose and a regulator combo, while a natural gas grill includes a longer 10-foot hose and a brass fitting that works with the home’s gas line. This longer hose and higher-end fitting increase the total price of the grill.</p> <h3>Q: How many burners do I need? </h3> <p>That depends on the size of the grilling surface and how you plan to grill. The more burners a grill has, the more evenly the grill can heat the cooking surface. Having access to a greater number of burners also helps the chef create more cooking zones, making it easier to grill various foods at different temperatures simultaneously.</p> <h3>Q: Which is healthier, propane or natural gas? </h3> <p>While neither fuel type presents much of a health risk for an outdoor grill, natural gas is lighter, which means it will rise safely away into the air more quickly than denser propane gas, which can linger longer around the living area.</p> <h3>Q: How do I properly clean my gas grill? </h3> <p>Use a scraper and wire brush to remove residue from the grates inside the lid and cooking box. Brush all the loose particles into the grease tray and then dump them in a trash bag. Wipe the interior and exterior of the grill using a damp rag or sponge. Never hose down a gas grill: It causes water to get into its nooks and crannies that takes longer to dry, leading to rust.</p> <h3>Q: Where should I store my gas grill?</h3> <p>While it’s best to store a gas grill out of the elements in a shed or garage, it isn’t possible for everyone. Instead, buy a high-quality grill cover to protect the grill from wet weather.</p> <h3>Q: How long will my gas grill last?</h3> <p>Depending on how well you take care of it, you can expect your gas grill to last 10 to 15 years.</p>",415
778,worm composters,"<h3><b>Q: How much do worm composters cost?</b></h3> <p><span>Worm composters vary in price depending on factors like size, the type of worm composter, the equipment the unit comes with, and where you buy it from. As a general guide, they can cost anywhere from $30 to $400.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: Is a worm farm better than a compost bin?</b></h3> <p><span>Traditional compost bins use microbes to break down organic matter, whereas worm composters use the worms themselves to do this job. The worms eat through the rotting scraps and excrete them to create worm castings (worm poop). These worm castings are full of nutrient-rich soil fertilizer that’s great for your garden. This process is a lot faster compared to other composting methods, especially when you have a lot of worms.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: How many worms will I need?</b></h3> <p><span>How many worms you need depends on two factors: how much food waste you regularly produce and the size of your worm bin.</span></p> <p><span>You can calculate your weekly food waste either by weighing it, or estimating the amount per week. The worms on average will eat between 25 to 35 percent of their weight per day. These figures are from </span><span>academia research</span><span>, however, some others suggest they eat a much higher amount. Using this information, we can calculate that 1 pound of worms can eat on average 1.75 to 2.45 pounds of food waste per week. </span></p> <p><span>Taking that into account, a good number of worms is 1 pound per the square footage of your chosen bin. For example, if your bin is 24 inches by 18 inches, the ideal amount for your bin would be 3 pounds of worms. You would need between 5.25 pounds and 7.35 pounds of food per week to keep them happy.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: Can worms eat banana peels?</b></h3> <p><span>Yes, worms, including red wigglers, can eat and enjoy banana peels as well as the flesh. Vermicomposting banana peels and the skins is a great, eco-friendly way to recycle banana waste. Just make sure to chop up the banana before putting it into your compost bin so that the worms can get to it before it goes sour. Other fruits that worms love include apples, watermelon, peaches, pears and apricots.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: How long does it take to compost using worms?</b></h3> <p><span>One of the main benefits of worm composting is it works quickly compared to other composting methods. The worms can convert most kitchen waste into compost within two weeks, and can also work throughout the winter, however, you may need to move your bin inside to reach the optimal temperature. In order to ensure the worms still work during the winter months, make sure to keep your worm bin between 55 and 80 degrees </span><span>Fahrenheit</span><span>. </span></p> <h3><b>Q: If I’m buying a new worm composter, what can I do with my existing one</b><b>?</b></h3> <p><span>If you already have an existing worm composter but plan to buy a new one, you could donate your old one to a friend or family member so they can reuse it. If the worm composter is broken or no longer viable, try </span><span>upcycling</span><span> it. Finding new ways to use old products can be incredibly rewarding, and helps to keep items out of landfills. If upcycling isn’t your thing, try researching </span><span>recycling programs</span><span> in your area, donate it to a local charity, or send it to an </span><span>organization</span><span> that supports environmental causes.</span></p> <h3><b>Q: Is it better to buy a new worm composter or a renewed/reused one?</b></h3> <p><span>One of the main principles of sustainable living is to reuse already existing items wherever possible. The same applies for worm composters. If you can get one that has been pre-owned, that is always better than buying brand new. Before you use a pre-owned worm composter, make sure it’s completely clean, dry and free of any contaminants.</span></p> <br/> <br/>",631

Before selecting a new thermal camera, these frequently asked questions and their answers below may help.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between an infrared camera and a thermal camera?</h3> <p>The difference between an infrared camera and a thermal camera is that infrared cameras use short wavelength infrared light, while thermal cameras tend to use medium or long wavelengths of infrared energy. Due to this difference, thermal cameras do not pick up reflected light. This means that the image is not distorted by lights, smoke, haze, dust, or any other particulates in the air.</p> <h3>Q: Who uses thermal imaging?</h3> <p>Thermal cameras can be used in residential, commercial, and industrial settings as well as in emergency situations and for security reasons. Its most common uses are to troubleshoot technical issues within residential buildings, assess mechanical problems, and detect high heat.</p> <h3>Q: How does a thermal camera work?</h3> <p>Most objects give off infrared energy that is known as a heat signature. A thermal camera detects and measures the infrared energy and converts the data into an electronic image, which displays the measured surface temperature of the object or objects.</p> <h3>Q: How accurate is a thermal camera?</h3> <p>Accuracy varies among individual products, but on average a thermal camera has an accuracy of plus or minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <h3>Q: What should I look for when buying a thermal imaging camera?</h3> <p>You should look for the type of thermal camera that can view your home’s suspected issues. The size, weight, accuracy, resolution, and other features can help you decide on a thermal imaging camera.</p> <h3>Q: Can thermal imaging see through walls or concrete?</h3> <p>Most thermal imaging models are not capable of taking thermal readings through walls, concrete, and other hard surfaces as they are thick enough to block infrared radiation.</p> <h3>Q: Do thermal cameras work in daylight?</h3> <p>As daylight and other light sources do not have an effect on infrared radiation, a thermal camera works just as well in daylight conditions as it would in total darkness.</p>",346

800,coolers,"<p>Wondering how a cooler works or how to pack it correctly? Curious about how long it will keep food cold? Let’s address some common questions that may come up while shopping for the best coolers.</p> <h3>Q. How do you pack your cooler correctly?</h3> <p>As a general rule, the proper ratio is 2:1 ice-to-food/beverage. A cooler is more efficient when packed tightly, so try to eliminate air pockets—air is the enemy of ice. Start with one layer of food or drink at the bottom (items you will want last), followed by a layer of ice, and then keep alternating layers. Ice should be the final layer, with whatever food and drink you require first right under it.</p> <h3>Q. How long does food stay cold in a cooler?</h3> <p>The heaviest-duty hard-shelled coolers can keep food cold for up to a week or in some cases 10 days, while soft versions typically keep ice frozen for a day or two at the most. To keep the food at its coldest, pre-chill a cooler by prepping it with ice beforehand, then throw that ice away before packing with fresh ice and items. The smallest models can be prepped right in the refrigerator. Always chill or freeze food and beverages so that they stay colder as well. Sprinkling rock salt on top of the ice can make it last longer. Finally, do not remove the water from the ice as it melts since the melted water helps keep the remaining ice insulated.</p> <h3>Q. How does a food cooler work?</h3> <p>Coolers keep your food and drinks cold with ice, thanks to the foam insulation between the inner and outer walls and along the top lid.</p> <h3>Q. What is a rotomolded cooler?</h3> <p>Rotomolding, which is short for <em>rotational molding,</em> is a manufacturing method that spins the mold as the plastic is poured in to make a more uniform, durable, and better-insulated cooler.</p>",315
801,battery powered leaf blower,"<p>Still wondering about why a battery powered leaf blower is such an attractive yard work option? Read on for answers to the most frequently asked questions about these machines. If you don’t find the info you need here, reach out to the manufacturers with specific questions.</p> <h3>Q: Which is better, a gas or battery powered leaf blower?</h3> <p>That depends on your work style and property size. Gas-powered leaf blowers will run for quite a while before emptying a gas tank, but they’re loud and require considerable maintenance. Battery powered options are lighter, quieter, and cleaner, but batteries can be expensive, and some can’t match the power of gas blowers.</p> <h3>Q: What is a good mph for a battery powered leaf blower? </h3> <p>For yard work and professional use, a battery powered leaf blower should be between 350 and 600 cfm, which is roughly 190 mph.</p> <h3>Q: What do you do with leaves after leaf blowing?</h3> <p>Check with your city or town’s garbage service. Many areas prefer that you bag your leaves in a biodegradable bag, as the city will use them for compost. You can also make your own garden mulch with your leaves. Try this method: Fill a clean garbage can up to a foot from the top with leaves. Then use a string trimmer to chop the leaves to a finer size. Spread your new leaf mulch over raised garden beds.</p> <h3>Q: How long do the batteries run for on cordless leaf blowers?</h3> <p>Expect fresh batteries from cordless blowers to last between about 15 and 30 minutes. Batteries with more amp hours last longer.</p>",265
802,backpack cooler,"<p>Read on to find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about backpack coolers so you have all the information you need to keep your food fresh during a long hike or camping trip.</p> <h3>Q. How do insulated cooler bags work?</h3> <p>Insulated cooler bags can keep the contents of the bag cool using one of two common methods. Some backpack coolers will rely on a space between the outer layer and the inner layer to prevent energy dissipation, in a way similar to a double pane of glass on a sliding glass door or window. The second method is to insert a core layer of dense foam between the outer layer and the inner layer to slow the transfer of heat through the bag.</p> <h3>Q. Do you put ice in a cooler first?</h3> <p>No, ice or ice packs should be layered between the food, always keeping the ice on top for better cooling efficiency because cool air falls to the bottom of the bag. You should start packing a backpack cooler by layering food, drinks, and as much ice as you need (or as the cooler can hold).</p> <h3>Q. How long will ice last in an insulated bag?</h3> <p>On average the ice or ice pack in a backpack cooler will last between 24 to 36 hours. However, this timeline can be longer in cold weather or shorter if the ambient temperature is very hot, so it’s a good idea to regularly check on food supplies.</p>",247
803,camping air mattress,"<p>If you’re still wondering about how air mattresses work, then read on for answers to some of the common questions about these camping luxury items.</p> <h3>Q. What do you put under an air mattress when camping?</h3> <p>While the tent floor will do an adequate job of protecting your air mattress, you can place a foam pad, blankets, or even house wrap paper such as Tyvek under the air mattress for extra protection.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take for a self-inflating mattress to inflate?</h3> <p>A self-inflating mattress will usually fill with air within a few minutes; however, to get the maximum amount of firmness for sleeping, you typically need to blow a few puffs into the valve.</p> <h3>Q. Do air mattresses deflate overnight?</h3> <p>All air mattresses will lose a little bit of air overnight for a few reasons. Air mattresses allow some air to escape to prevent the mattress from bursting from the weight of you lying on it. Changes in air pressure can also cause an air mattress to lose its firmness.</p> <h3>Q. Can you wash an inflatable mattress?</h3> <p>To wash an inflatable air mattress, wipe it down with a damp cloth. Make sure to allow the mattress to dry completely before packing it away to prevent mold growth.</p>",210

810,dryer,"<p>If you’re still curious about how dryers operate, read on for answers to some of the most common questions about these appliances.</p> <h3>Q. How does a ventless dryer work?</h3> <p>A ventless dryer works by recycling the air that it uses. The dryer warms the air using a gas or electric heating element, which dries the clothes. The humid air then leaves the dryer compartment and travels into either a compressor or cold water that cools the air, removing the water vapor it collected from damp clothing. The condensed water exits using the same drainpipe as the washing machine. The air is then sent back to the heating element, where the cycle begins again.</p> <h3>Q. How hot does a dryer get?</h3> <p>The heat depends on the dryer model and its temperature setting. That said, most dryers have a maximum temperature of between 125 and 135 degrees.</p> <h3>Q. Do dryers kill germs?</h3> <p>If a dryer gets hot enough, it will kill more germs and bacteria. A dryer needs to reach a temperature of about 135 degrees to kill most bacteria and viruses. Cycle length also matters. A dryer that reaches 135 degrees should run for about an hour to thoroughly sanitize clothes.</p> <h3>Q. Is it OK to leave a dryer running overnight?</h3> <p>In addition to reaching high heat, a dryer also uses friction and motors. This creates a potential fire hazard, which means that you should never run a dryer while you’re away or at night while you’re sleeping.</p> <h3>Q. How long do dryers last?</h3> <p>A dryer should last about 10 to 13 years. You can extend your dryer’s lifespan by cleaning the lint trap regularly, keeping the vent lint-free, and periodically cleaning the drum interior.</p>",284
811,dryer vent,"<p>If you’re still wondering which dryer vent is right for your laundry room, look below for answers to some of the most common questions about these devices.</p> <h3>Q: How do you hook up a dryer vent in a tight space?</h3> <p>A standard tube dryer vent requires about 6 inches of clearance between the back of the dryer and the wall in order to function properly. Moving the dryer too close to the wall can pinch the tube, inhibiting the airflow. A periscope-style dryer vent or recessed dryer vent box will reduce the clearance to just a couple of inches, which makes this kind of vent ideal for tight spaces.</p> <h3>Q: How often do you clean a dryer vent?</h3> <p>A dryer vent should be cleaned about once a year depending on the size of the family and how often you use the dryer.</p> <h3>Q: How long can a dryer vent be?</h3> <p>The maximum length of a dryer vent hose should not exceed 35 feet. A longer dryer vent can actually negatively affect the efficiency of the dryer, causing it to take longer to dry clothes.</p> <h3>Q: How do you replace a dryer vent?</h3> <p>When replacing an existing dryer vent, first make sure to purchase the proper size hose. Remove the old vent by unscrewing the fasteners holding it to the exterior of the house. Remove the old dryer hose from the rear of the dryer and the interior wall. Mount the new dryer vent to the exterior of the home using the existing vent hole. You may need to apply caulk to seal the edges of the vent to the home if there is no gasket. Attach the new dryer tube to the rear of the dryer and the vent using two galvanized full clamps.</p> <h3>Q: How do you keep birds out of a dryer vent?</h3> <p>Buy a dryer vent designed to prevent birds from nesting in the vent. Ideal for this purpose are flap-style vents that close when the dryer is not in use, which prevents rodents and birds from getting into the vent.</p>",344
812,portable charcoal grill,"<p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about portable charcoal grills. Be sure to check for an answer to your question listed below.</p> <h3>Q: Does charcoal add flavor?</h3> <p>Yes, cooking with charcoal does add flavor to food. As the food heats up and drips onto the scorching coals, it combusts and creates the vapors and smoky flavor that make charcoal-grilled food so tasty.</p> <h3>Q: How much charcoal do you put in a portable grill?</h3> <p>Many factors go into this, but a good rule of thumb is to use about 30 briquettes of charcoal for small or portable grills.</p> <h3>Q: Is the smoke from charcoal dangerous?</h3> <p>Breathing in any byproduct of combustion isn’t healthy for you, and burning charcoal does also emit carbon monoxide. But as long as you stay out of the smoke and grill outside, there’s very little risk.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a small portable charcoal grill?</h3> <p>Using a small portable charcoal grill is no different from a larger unit. Simply place the briquettes on the lower grate (or in the bottom of the grill, depending on the model), use a small amount of lighter fluid on the briquettes, open the vents, and light the charcoal with a match. Allow all the briquettes to light and ash over before cooking.</p> <h3>Q: How often do you need to clean a charcoal grill?</h3> <p>Truth be told, you should be cleaning your charcoal grill, or any grill, every time you’re finished with it. This will keep fats and oils from burning into the grates and adding unwanted flavors. Use a grill brush to scrub the grates until they’re clean.</p>",271
813,washer and dryer,"<p>If you are left with a few questions about selecting the best washer and dryer, check out the FAQs below for additional information you may find useful.</p> <h3>Q: Which type of washing machine gets clothes the cleanest?</h3> <p>While performance may vary based on the specific model selected, front-load washers are typically more effective at cleaning clothing than top-load washers.</p> <h3>Q: How does a ventless dryer work?</h3> <p>Most ventless dryers are condenser dryers. These dryers pull in the air from the space and heat it up. However, unlike vented dryers that exhaust this air through a dryer vent hose, condenser dryers cool it back down. This converts the moisture into a liquid. This liquid is collected and reheated again, which continues the drying process. Once the dryer has finished drying clothes, the collected water can be poured out from the tray.</p> <h3>Q: How long does it take to do a load of laundry in a washer/dryer combo?</h3> <p>It can take up to 6 hours to complete a load of laundry in an all-in-one washer dryer combo. The exact amount of time can vary based on the items in the cycle; some loads may finish washing and drying in about 3 hours.</p> <h3>Q: What is the most reliable brand of washer and dryer?</h3> <p>There are many different appliance brands available, though not all of them should claim to be reliable. The top washer and dryer brands based on reliability include Whirlpool, LG, Samsung, Maytag, and Bosch.</p> <h3>Q: When is the best time to buy a washer and dryer?</h3> <p>The best time to buy a washer and dryer is when the new models are introduced. This typically occurs in September and October, while new refrigerator models update in May, and ovens come out in January.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain my washer and loader?</h3> <p>Keeping your washer and dryer clean is important for maintaining the units. Washing machine cleaners can be used to keep the basin of a washing machine free of mold, mildew, and detergent buildup. The dryer’s lint filter should be cleaned out after each use as well.</p> <p>Each month, check the dryer vent hose for any crimps, bends, tears, or obstructions. Assess the washing machine hoses to make sure they are not cracked or leaking and are properly connected.</p> <p>Each year, clean the dryer vent hose to remove any lint. If you are unsure of how to do this, hire a professional dryer vent cleaning company.</p> <h3>Q: How long should my washer and dryer last?</h3> <p>The amount of time your washer and dryer will last can vary based on the quality of the models you purchased, how frequently you do laundry, and the care and maintenance you perform. Washers generally last about 10 years, and dryers typically last for 10 to 13 years.</p>",463

If you’d like more info on how to shop for, use, and maintain these machines, read on for answers to commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Do I live in the right climate for an evaporative air cooler?</h3> <p>Evaporative air coolers pull dry, warm air through a wet media pad causing the top layer of water to evaporate and lower the temperature within the cooler by 10 to 20 degrees. This process of evaporative cooling works best in hot, dry climates common in the American Southwest, including Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, the California desert, and parts of Texas and Colorado. These coolers can function outside of these regions, but the higher the ambient humidity, the less effective the coolers will be at producing cold air.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need to change the media pads for an evaporative air cooler often? </h3> <p>The frequency with which the media pads need to be changed depends on the individual product and the frequency of use. Typically, the more often the cooler is used, the more frequently the media pads will need to be replaced. However, some media pads can be removed, cleaned with a mild detergent, and reinstalled.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need to close all doors and windows when using an evaporative air cooler? </h3> <p>No—in fact, evaporative air coolers actually benefit from access to outdoor air because they require warm, dry air to produce cool, moist air. It’s advised to have a nearby window or door opened to provide a constant source of warm, dry air to flow through the cooler.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain my evaporative air cooler?</h3> <p>Evaporative air coolers are relatively low maintenance. During operation throughout the hotter months, regularly replace the water and clean the media pad with water and a mild detergent to help avoid mold growth. Also, wipe down the outer housing of the cooler to remove dust and dirt.</p> <p>When the temperatures get colder, drain the water tank and water line, and then run the fan-only feature for 30 minutes to an hour to dry out the machine and the pads. Then store the cooler in a protected place, like a garage, shed, or basement.</p>",381
816,humidifier for large room,"<p>If you’re still wondering how humidifiers work, keep reading for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these appliances.</p> <h3>Q: What is the recommended indoor humidity level?</h3> <p>The ideal indoor humidity level for health and comfort is between 40 and 50 percent to help ease cold and allergy symptoms and make breathing easier while not making the air so humid that it promotes mold growth.</p> <h3>Q: Where should a humidifier be placed in a room?</h3> <p>The best place to position a humidifier is a few feet from the bed. This position allows the moist air to circulate enough to ease cold and allergy symptoms while not being so close that the user can breathe into it and distribute germs around the room.</p> <h3>Q: Can I run my humidifier all night? </h3> <p>It’s safe to leave a humidifier on all night if the unit has an automatic shutoff feature that turns off the unit when the reservoir is dry. An evaporative humidifier should also have a humidistat that turns off the unit after it reaches a certain humidity level to prevent the unit from over-humidifying the room.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use tap water in the humidifier? </h3> <p>Although it’s OK to use tap water in a humidifier, distilled water is a better option. Tap water often has minerals in it that can leave deposits inside the humidifier or get released with the water vapor, leaving white dust on furniture around the room.</p> <h3>Q: Is a warm or cool mist humidifier better for sinuses?</h3> <p>If you have sensitive sinuses or are suffering from a cold or flu, any cold or warm mist from a humidifier can help to ease your sinus congestion. However, warm mist may be a better option as it can soothe the sinuses more effectively.</p>",297
817,standby generator,"<p>Even after deciding on the best standby generator for your home, these complex machines can leave new users with a host of questions. Take a look below to get the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about standby generators so that you can feel confident in your decision.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between portable and standby generators?</h3> <p>There are many differences between portable and standby generators. Portable generators are movable, while standby generators are stationary. Standby generators also output a much higher amount of electricity than portable generators, making them suitable for a whole home instead of only powering a camper. In appearance, portable generators are open with exposed engine parts, while standby generators are fully enclosed. Another feature of standby generators that sets them apart from portable generators is the automatic start function that detects when there is a power outage and automatically starts the generator within about 1 minute.</p> <h3>Q: How do I correctly size a generator for my home?</h3> <p>In order to determine the correct size of a standby generator for your home, find the wattage of the appliances in the home, like the fridge, stove, furnace, and freezer. Add up these numbers to find the necessary wattage to run the home, then look for a generator that can supply the house with a higher amount of electricity. Typically, the essential appliances in a home will use about 5,000 watts, so this should be the minimum size for a standby generator.</p> <h3>Q: How long can a standby generator run continuously?</h3> <p>The runtime varies with the size, appliance load, and the type of fuel, but typically a liquid propane generator with a 100-gallon tank of fuel will run for about 50 hours, while a 250-gallon tank runs for about 125 hours.</p> <h3>Q: Can an automatic standby generator replace the utility service?</h3> <p>No, an automatic standby generator is a poor replacement for standard utility service because the fuel costs greatly exceed the cost of electricity from the utility company.</p> <h3>Q: Can I install the generator myself?</h3> <p>It depends on your level of proficiency with electrical systems, fuel systems, and residential permits. While some manufacturers offer prepackaged and prewired systems with installation guides, it may be a better idea to employ a professional electrician to connect the generator to your home and consider using a plumber or gas fitter to connect a natural gas line. These professionals handle this type of work regularly, so there is less chance of a detrimental mistake that could leave you without power when you are expecting the backup.</p> <h3>Q: Does the generator have to be maintained?</h3> <p>Standby generators do need to be regularly maintained, including routine oil changes, replacing air filters, and semi-regular periods of operation to allow the generator to charge the starting battery.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the advantage of an aluminum or composite generator enclosure?</h3> <p>Using aluminum or composite enclosures on a standby generator helps protect the unit from rust and corrosion. These materials are also resistant to salty air and humid conditions, making them a good option for coastal areas.</p>",511
818,personal air conditioner,"<p>If you still have questions about how well personal air conditioners work, then read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these devices.</p> <h3>Q. How much electricity does a personal air conditioner use?</h3> <p>Personal air conditioners use a minimal amount of electricity. In fact, many can run off of rechargeable batteries for hours.</p> <h3>Q. How effective are personal air conditioners?</h3> <p>Personal air conditioners provide cooler air than a standard fan; however, they are no replacement for a traditional or split air conditioner that uses refrigerant and a compressor. To be most effective, they need to blow directly onto the user from no more than a few feet away.</p> <h3>Q. Can a personal air conditioner cool a room?</h3> <p>A personal air conditioner typically is not powerful enough to cool a room.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Personal air conditioners are not intended to cool an entire room but rather to provide relief to someone sitting near the fan. These small devices, which weigh around a pound, lack the powerful refrigerant other air conditioners use to cool air. However, they can create a cool mist by using ice water instead to offer some relief on a scorching summer day. Unlike standard air conditioners that have a compressor, they use very little electricity. These personal cooling machines can make ideal companions for camping trips, a day at the beach, and other outdoor excursions.</p>",232
819,energy efficient air conditioners,"<p>Understanding how to maintain and operate an air conditioner to get the most out of it is key to keeping that utility bill in check during the summer months. Ahead, learn about the most efficient way to run an air conditioner and learn how upgrading your aging AC unit to a newer model can save you money.</p> <h3>Q. Do new air conditioners use less electricity?</h3> <p>A new air conditioner generally uses less electricity because it is more technologically advanced than older models. Air-conditioner compressors also cool less efficiently as they get older, forcing them to work harder and use more energy to cool the room.</p> <h3>Q. How can I reduce the power consumption of my air conditioner?</h3> <p>There are several ways to reduce the power consumption of an air conditioner. The most obvious is turning up the thermostat to a higher temperature. Clean the air conditioner and replace the filter regularly to ensure the air conditioner is in peak condition. If possible, switch to a smart thermostat that allows you to schedule on/off times for the air conditioner, so it isn’t running when it doesn’t have to.</p> <h3>Q. Is it cheaper to leave the air conditioner on all day?</h3> <p>It is cheaper to leave the air conditioner on all day during hot temperatures. Turning off the air conditioner during hot and humid weather can quickly cause heat and humidity to build up in the home. This places a strain on the air conditioner to cool the home when you turn it back on. A better option is to adjust the air conditioner by a few degrees when you’re not home.</p> <h3>Q. Is it cheaper to run AC or a fan?</h3> <p>Fans are much cheaper to operate than air conditioners because they do not use a compressor. It’s a good idea to use fans in combination with air conditioners to make the air feel cooler, allowing you to increase the thermostat a few degrees.</p> <h3>Q. How efficient is a 20-year-old AC?</h3> <p>A 20-year old air conditioner is much less efficient than today’s models. An older air conditioner may use 6 kilowatt-hours of electricity to cool an average house, while a modern system can use less than 2 kilowatt-hours to cool the same space.</p> <h3>Q. Which AC is more energy efficient: window or mini-split?</h3> <p>A mini-split air conditioner is much more efficient than a window unit. The average mini-split consumes 40 percent less energy than a window air conditioner to cool the same space.</p> <h3>Q. Is it cheaper to run a window air conditioner or central air?</h3> <p>It depends on what you’re trying to cool. If your goal is to cool a single room, then a window air conditioner is the best option. If you need to cool an entire home, it’s more economical to use a central air conditioner than placing a window unit in every room of the home.</p>",479
820,portable air purifiers,"<p>You may have a few lingering questions before buying a portable air purifier. We’ve answered the most common ones to wrap up your search.</p> <h3>Q. Are portable air purifiers worth it?</h3> <p>For people with severe allergies, who are sensitive to odors, or who live in areas with high air pollution, portable air purifiers are worth the purchase price.</p> <h3>Q. Should I run my air purifier all day?</h3> <p>To maintain the air quality of a single room, an air purifier must run all day. With a portable model, run the air purifier when necessary. If sleeping in the room, leave the air purifier running for as long as possible to maintain consistent air quality.</p> <h3>Q. Are air purifiers good for Covid-19?</h3> <p>No conclusive evidence exists that air purifiers can filter for the coronavirus. HEPA filters can trap the air droplets that contain a virus, making them the best portable air purifier for Covid-19. However, those droplets must be airborne for the air purifier to be effective.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a smart air purifier?</h3> <p>You don’t need a smart air purifier, especially in a portable model. Portable models are basic and lightweight. Most people turn them on while they’re in the car or use them when traveling. Save smart air purifiers for models that will run continuously in your home.</p> <h3>Q. Where is the best place to put an air purifier?</h3> <p>Place the air purifier away from any obstructions like curtains, blankets, or pillows that could restrict air circulation. It also should be placed in a fairly central location to equally distribute clean air.</p>",263
821,stick vacuums,"<p>After reading about some of the best stick vacuums, some questions may linger. Below are answers to some of the most common questions about stick vacuums.</p> <h3>Q. Which cordless stick vacuum is best for pet hair?</h3> <p>Cordless stick vacuums are great for removing pet hair on a daily basis. In this lineup, the Shark Pet Power stick vacuum comes in as the best-for-pets pick for its long runtime and anti-allergen seals to keep dander from recirculating.</p> <h3>Q. Are stick vacuums worth it?</h3> <p>For those living in small apartments, a stick vacuum can serve as the primary home vacuum. Those living in larger homes may want to consider a stick vacuum as a second vacuum that’s used mainly for quick, frequent cleaning.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best portable stick vacuum to buy?</h3> <p>Consider both size and weight when shopping for a portable stick vacuum. The Bissell Featherweight stick vacuum, the pick in this lineup for small spaces, weighs just 2.6 pounds, and the stick detaches for easy transport in a small car trunk or floorboard.</p>",174
822,vinyl siding cleaner,"<p>While vinyl siding is low maintenance, it can become dingy or develop mold and mildew stains like any other siding. Restoring and refreshing the siding is a simple process that often involves spraying on a suitable cleaner and then rinsing it off. For those new to cleaning vinyl siding, a few questions are to be expected.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best way to clean vinyl siding?</h3> <p>The fastest way to clean vinyl siding is with a power washer, but using one isn’t essential. Many vinyl siding products come in hose-end jugs that spray diluted cleaner right from the hose, and others can be diluted in a bucket of water and applied with a soft nylon brush. All three methods work equally well.</p> <h3>Q: Is it OK to power wash vinyl siding?</h3> <p>Yes, but use the lowest pressure setting on the power washer. To keep it from getting under the siding, don’t direct the spray at an upward angle. It is also best to avoid spraying directly into the seams at corners or around doors or windows.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean vinyl siding without a pressure washer?</h3> <p>Add concentrated siding cleaner to a hose-end dispenser and attach a garden hose to the washer. Turn on the power washer and spray the diluted solution on the siding to remove grime, mold, and mildew. Alternatively, dilute the cleaner in a large bucket of water and use a soft nylon brush to clean the siding. In all cases, rinse the siding with clear water after cleaning.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>Vinyl siding is easy to maintain for the most part, but it will look its best when periodically cleaned—once a year is often sufficient—with a product designed to dissolve grime while removing mold and mildew growth.</p>",291
823,glass cleaner,"<p>Glass cleaners remove smudges and debris that can cloud windows and mirrors without streaking, but they’re not all created equal. Some contain chemicals, while others feature only natural ingredients, and most are well suited to cleaning other nonporous items in the home. For those who want the cleanest, freshest shine, some questions are to be expected.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best glass cleaner?</h3> <p>The best glass cleaner can vary depending on its intended use— meaning, the cleaner for a glass cooktop isn’t the best choice for a mirror. For general glass cleaning, however, the best overall option in the above lineup is Sprayway Glass Cleaner, a versatile foaming aerosol glass cleaner that works on mirrors and windows and also shines up stainless steel, chrome, tile, porcelain, enamel, manufacturer-tinted windows, stone countertops, and greasy stove hoods.</p> <h3>Q. What do professional window cleaners use to clean windows?</h3> <p>Professional window cleaners use a variety of cleaning solutions, and Sparkle Glass Cleaner is a frequent choice. Professionals clean windows a bit differently, though; they spray the cleaner on the window and then use a razor scraper to remove every last trace of haze or residue before wiping the glass to a nearly perfect shine.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best thing to clean windows with?</h3> <p>For a streak-free surface, spray windows with a good-quality glass cleaner and then wipe until dry with a clean, soft cloth. Microfiber towels work well for buffing windows to a spotless shine, and the pros sometimes use newspapers as well.</p>",250
824,grill brush,"<p>Now that you’ve learned about what to look for while shopping for the best grill brush, there may still be some lingering questions about specifics. Read on for answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of brush should I use to clean my grill?</h3> <p>Choose a grill brush that will be able to clean your grill without damaging the grill grates. The style and material are up to personal preference, ranging from soft, bristle-free nylon to abrasive, stainless steel-bristle grill brushes.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best grill brush for stainless steel grates?</h3> <p>If you regularly clean your grill, then nylon brushes are the best option to help prevent chipping, rusting, and corrosion. However, a brass or stainless steel brush may be necessary to remove burned food, sauces, and fat from a dirty grill.</p> <h3>Q. What can I use instead of a wire grill brush?</h3> <p>Clean a grill with a nylon bristle brush or a nylon bristle-free brush instead of using a wire grill brush.</p>",169
825,robotic pool cleaner,"<p>Still curious about how robotic pool cleaners work? Consider these frequently asked questions about robotic pool cleaners and the answers.</p> <h3>Q: Do robotic pool cleaners pick up leaves? </h3> <p>Robotic pool cleaners do pick up leaves, though if you have a pool that gets a lot of leaves, it’s important to invest in a robotic pool vacuum that has a large filtration basket to prevent the pool cleaner from filling up before it can finish the cleaning cycle.</p> <h3>Q: Can you leave a robotic pool cleaner in a pool? </h3> <p>You can leave the robotic cleaner in the pool without experiencing immediate negative consequences, but the extended time spent underwater will wear out the cleaner faster than if you remove and clean it following the completion of its cleaning cycle.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use an extension cord with a robot pool cleaner? </h3> <p>An extension cord isn’t a good idea to use with a robotic pool cleaner because the connection between the extension cord and the robot can be pulled into the water. When a live extension cable is dropped into a pool it can shock anyone in the water, putting yourself and your family at risk of electrocution and drowning.</p> <h3>Q: How often should I use my robotic pool cleaner? </h3> <p>Robotic pool cleaners can run on a daily basis if the pool is heavily used. If the pool is not used every day, weekly cleanings should maintain your pool.</p> <h3>Q: How do you maintain a robotic pool cleaner? </h3> <p>Robotic pool cleaners function like robotic vacuums. Like robotic vacuums, you must empty the collection bins, inspect the filters for damage, and clean robotic pool cleaners to keep them working properly. The brushes under the robot and the side brushes need regular cleaning to prevent the robotic pool cleaner from malfunctioning. Undertake any repairs only after referring to the product warranty.</p> <h3>Q: How long do robotic pool cleaners last? </h3> <p>On average, a robotic pool cleaner will last for about 5 years, though they can last longer if they are properly maintained and stored.</p>",339
826,cordless vacuum for pet hair,"<p>Cordless vacuums for pet hair can reduce the amount of dander and hair in your furniture, rugs, hard floors, and drapery. They are also convenient and don’t take up a lot of storage space, but you may still have questions about how to use and take care of these tools. If you’re shopping for your first cordless vacuum for pet hair, read on for some of the most popular questions asked by users.</p> <h3>Q: Can the same vacuum for pet hair work on different floors? </h3> <p>Yes, the best vacuums for pet hair adapt to different floor surfaces, and many also adjust to the various thicknesses of carpet.</p> <h3>Q: Are cordless vacuums for pet hair less powerful?</h3> <p>Corded vacuums are more powerful because they have continuous power from an electrical outlet. The main downside to a cordless vacuum is that it may run out of power before you are finished cleaning.</p> <h3>Q: Are bagged or bagless vacuums for pet hair better for allergies?</h3> <p>That is a personal choice, but bagless vacuums expose you to more dust and dirt when you empty them. To open a bagged vacuum, on the other hand, you remove and seal the bag with the hair and other debris.</p> <h3>Q: How do I unclog a vacuum for pet hair?</h3> <p>Some of the best vacuums for pet hair are designed so that pet hair doesn’t clog their hoses and dust bins. If you experience a clogged hose, it’s recommended that you stretch or detach the hose and use a long stick to remove the hair.</p> <h3>Q: How do I clean a cordless vacuum?</h3> <p>Dump the dust bin when it becomes full, and replace (or wash) the vacuum’s filter to keep it clean. The rollers on most vacuum powerheads can be taken out and cleaned to remove threads and string that tend to wind up around the rollers, making them less efficient.</p>",313
827,pool vacuum,"<p>Pool vacuums, like the pools they clean, come in many different shapes and sizes. If you still feel like you’re drowning in information, you might have some questions that need answering. Below are some frequently asked questions about pool vacuums.</p> <h3>Q: How often should I vacuum my pool?</h3> <p>You can vacuum your pool anytime you notice a lot of debris at the bottom. In regard to regular maintenance, you should vacuum your pool once a week.</p> <h3>Q: Is it okay to leave a pool vacuum in the pool?</h3> <p>Some manufacturers design their vacuums to spend days at a time submerged in a pool. While it does potentially shorten the vacuum’s lifespan due to corrosives like chlorine or salt, it’s generally okay to leave certain vacuums in the pool for days at a time. Vacuums that use a timer are best suited for these situations.</p> <h3>Q: Why is my pool dirty after I’ve vacuumed it?</h3> <p>This could be an issue with the pool filter. While you’re removing the gunk from the bottom of the pool, it’s the filtration system’s job to clean the water. If the filter doesn’t remove these particles kicked up by the vacuum, they’ll sink to the bottom of the pool, giving it a dirty appearance again.</p>",209
828,mold remover,"<p>If you still have questions about the best mold removers, that’s okay. There’s a lot to know. The following are answers to some of the most frequently-asked questions.

Black mold, on the other hand, has a damp, earthy, mildew-like smell, similar to soil.</p> <h3>Q: What does black mold look like?</h3> <p>Black mold has a spotty appearance and is usually greenish-black in color, though it can often look brown or gray.</p> <h3>Q: Does mold come back after cleaning?</h3> <p>If you don’t stop the source of the moisture, mold will most definitely return. Also, if you simply bleach the surface of a material like drywall, you won’t remove the roots of the mold that are deep inside. The mold may rebloom within a day or two.</p> <h3>Q: What are the effects of mold?</h3> <p>Mold has a variety of effects on your home and your health. It can turn surfaces like wood and drywall into dust. It can also cause respiratory problems, cold-like symptoms, eye irritation, and skin irritation.</p>",186
829,screen cleaner,"<p>Screen cleaners are a simple and affordable way to keep your devices free from fingerprints, dust, and smudges. They offer an effective clean without damaging the fragile screen or screen coating. A proper screen cleaning method can prolong your device screen lifespan and keep it looking like new. Here are a few questions to consider when using a screen cleaner.</p> <h3>Q. Are disinfecting wipes safe for cleaning screens?</h3> <p>It is best to check with the device manufacturer to confirm which options are safe for your device. Some disinfecting wipes may be safe to use, but it’s not wise to assume they all are.</p> <h3>Q. What is screen cleaner made of?</h3> <p>Liquid screen cleaners are water-based and often include a surfactant to remove smudges from screens. Fabric screen cleaners are most commonly made of microfiber.</p> <h3>Q. How do you properly clean a screen with screen cleaner?</h3> <p>Cleaning wipes, dry cloths, and other cleaning devices can be used alone to gently wipe the screen. If using a spray cleaner, spray the solution on a screen cleaning cloth and then wipe the screen.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use vinegar to clean a computer screen?</h3> <p>Vinegar may cause damage to some protective screen coatings. Unlike with household chores, like scrubbing surfaces and window screens, it is best to avoid vinegar on electronic screens.</p> <h3>Q. What should you avoid when cleaning an LCD screen?</h3> <p>Avoid harsh chemicals like ammonia and alcohol when cleaning delicate LCD screens. Also, avoid using abrasive cloths. It is best to use a soft, lint-free cloth (like a microfiber cloth).</p> <h3>Q. How do you ensure that you don’t leave streaks after cleaning a screen?</h3> <p>If using a liquid cleaner, ensure that the cloth or wipe is not too wet. A dry microfiber cloth can be used after the initial clean to gently polish out any streaks.</p>",304
830,flea fogger,"<p>Consider these frequently asked questions about flea foggers for your home or yard if you aren’t certain about what product would be suitable for treating the infestation.</p> <h3>Q: Do flea foggers kill fleas instantly?</h3> <p>No, foggers don’t typically kill fleas instantly, but the time between poisoning and death is only a few hours. The pesticide must adhere to them so that it can be absorbed into the body before it can begin to take effect.</p> <h3>Q: How long does it take to kill fleas after fogging?</h3> <p>The period between the flea fogger being set off and the fleas being killed is generally between two to eight hours, depending on the specific product, the severity of the infestation, the size of the area being treated, and the active ingredient in the flea fogger.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a flea fogger in one room and stay in the house?</h3> <p>Staying in the home while a flea fogger is being used is a bad idea. Houses are designed to connect through ventilation systems and the gaseous pesticide can seep through the walls, under doors, and even up into connected ceilings. In fact, the house should remain completely clear of people and pets for a few hours during and after the bug bombing to ensure all family members are safe.</p> <h3>Q: Do I have to wash everything after using a flea fogger?</h3> <p>After a flea fogger is used, anything that is exposed to the chemicals, like clothing, bedding, and furniture, should be washed to ensure that lingering pesticides cannot negatively affect the health of the people in the home.</p> <p>Keep this in mind before using a flea fogger to get rid of fleas in the home, so that exposed food or flea-free clothing and bedding can be placed into a protective garbage bag to shield them from the fogger. However, as with any dangerous substance, the manufacturer’s directions for use of a specific product should take precedence over more generalized directions for use of flea foggers.</p>",332

Some studies also indicate that creosote may be a carcinogen (a cancer-causing agent).</p> <h3>Q. Will a hot fire remove creosote?</h3> <p>No, the hotter the fire, the more likely it is to cause creosote.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I burn a creosote log?</h3> <p>Burn a creosote log once every 30 to 60 fires, depending on the brand of the log.</p> <h3>Q. Are creosote logs safe for wood stoves?</h3> <p>Yes, creosote logs will help clean away deposits in a wood-stove flue just as in a wood-burning fireplace.</p>",157

For more tips on choosing the best bed bug mattress cover for your bedroom, consider the commonly asked questions and answers below.</p> <h3>Q.

Can bed bugs bite through mattress encasements? </h3> <p>No, bed bugs are not able to bite through a bed bug mattress encasement.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I wash my bed bug mattress covers? </h3> <p>It depends on the intended use.

Those using a cover as a preventive measure or mattress protector can wash the encasements once every month or two.</p> <p>If the cover is being used to deal with an existing bed bug infestation, it should not be removed for upward of a year.

845,marble sealers,"<p>Applying a new sealer to one’s precious marble shower or countertops can be a scary proposition. If you’re concerned about the safety of a sealer for your marble, if the sealer is working, or even if you need a sealer at all, then read on for answers.</p> <h3>Q. How can you tell if marble is sealed?</h3> <p>The best way to determine if marble is sealed is to use the water test. Take a few spoonfuls of water and pour it onto the marble. Wait about 10 or 15 minutes, then wipe up the water with a paper towel. If the marble where you poured the water is darker than the surrounding marble, then some of the water was able to soak into the stone. This means you need to seal the marble. If not, then the marble is already protected.</p> <h3>Q. Does polished marble need to be sealed?</h3> <p>When marble is polished to a high gloss, the process reduces the porousness, making it less susceptible to stains. Since polished marble doesn’t absorb liquids easily, it doesn’t need to be sealed and may not even accept the sealer.</p> <h3>Q. Does sealing marble change the color?</h3> <p>The sealer will not change the color of the marble when it soaks into the pores, nor should it add shine unless the product includes an additive that creates a glossy finish.</p> <h3>Q. How often does marble need to be sealed?</h3> <p>This depends on the product. Many sealers will protect marble for as long as 5 years. Others require more frequent applications. Check the directions on the product’s label for guidance.</p> <h3>Q. How long is the reapplication and cure time for marble sealer?</h3> <p>Most sealers take about 20 minutes to dry before it is safe to apply additional layers. It then takes about 24 hours for a sealer to fully cure.</p> <h3>Q. How long does marble sealer last?</h3> <p>Most marble sealers have a shelf life of about a year after being opened. Since the majority of marble requires sealing about once every 5 years, purchase only the amount you need to avoid waste.</p>",347

854,surge protectors,"<p>After reading this guide, you still may have questions about selecting the best surge protector or using it safely. Find some of the most frequently asked questions about buying and using a new surge protector below.</p> <h3>Q. How do surge protectors work?</h3> <p>When the voltage from an outlet surges or rises above a certain threshold, known as the “clamping voltage,” a surge protector diverts excess current above that threshold to a ground wire that extends into the ground beneath the home, preventing damage to the devices plugged into the protector, but keeping them still powered and operational.</p> <h3>Q. How many joules does a good surge protector have?</h3> <p>A rating of at least 360 joules is desirable, but the higher the rating, the better. For expensive or surge-sensitive electronics (e.g., hard drives), look for at least 1,000 joules.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a surge protector?</h3> <p>Beyond an adequate joule rating, look for a device labeled “UL Listed,” with a clamping voltage of no more than 400 volts and a status indicator to let you know the devices are protected. The number of outlets should match the number of devices that need protection. The average user needs at least five. Energy-saving features like automatic outlet shutoff are nice to have, but not a must.</p> <h3>Q. What can you <em>not</em> plug into a surge protector?</h3> <p>To avoid circuit overloads and fires, don’t plug in medical equipment, refrigerators, space heaters, or other devices with a motor unless the surge protector is labeled for use with that type of equipment. Never plug a surge protector or power strip into another surge protector.</p>",268

When comparing bulbs of similar wattages, LEDs will be more efficient and, therefore, brighter.</p> <h3>Q: Do LED lights lose brightness over time?</h3> <p>Yes, LEDs do lose their brightness over time. They don’t burn out like standard bulbs, but they will slowly become dimmer.</p>",142

Stomach sleepers usually look for a mattress that prevents their body from sinking too deep into the mattress and keeps their spine in alignment.</p> <h3>Q: Do stomach sleepers need a firm mattress?</h3> <p>Yes, stomach sleepers usually need a firmer mattress.

Read on to learn more about what to expect and how to keep the system in top condition.</p> <h3>Q. How big of a hydration pack do I need?</h3> <p>Consider how much gear you typically carry and how long you typically go out. Match the cargo volume to the amount of gear needed, other than water. The water bladder should be large enough to keep you supplied until the next fill up. For running a few miles, .5 liters is probably enough.

It is best to empty and clean the bladder after each use, rather than leaving old water in it.</p> <h3>Q.

They typically last between one and four years, but with proper care, they may last longer.</p>",324
896,binders,"<p>If you still have questions about the durability of binders or what size is right for you, then read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these office supplies.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most durable binder?</h3> <p>The most durable binder uses a hard plastic cover that resists cracking and tearing. The plastic material can better withstand pressure applied to the binder that might otherwise tear a vinyl-covered cardboard cover. Binders with padded ripstop nylon covers, though bulkier, are also very durable.</p> <h3>Q. What are the different sizes of binders?</h3> <p>Binders come in different sizes to suit various needs. For big projects that include numerous pages, a 2-inch binder may be required to hold everything you need. Small presentations or a work portfolio for a job interview may not require a bulky 2-inch binder, in which case a 1-inch or even a ½-inch binder might suffice.</p> <h3>Q. How do I organize my work binder?</h3> <p>While binders allow for time-saving organization, simply stuffing pages into a binder won’t do much good. The best way to organize a binder is to divide the content that goes in it into sections. Then, use dividers with tabs to separate and clearly label each section, making it more efficient to find what you need when you open the binder. You might begin by creating categories before loading the binder or add sections as you work based on what needs to go into the binder.</p> <h3>Q. How long do binders last?</h3> <p>How long a binder lasts mostly depends on its construction and the amount of abuse it takes. A standard hardback vinyl binder may last less than a year if it regularly travels from place to place in a backpack or bag, whereas the same binder may last years if it never leaves your office and spends most of its time on a shelf.</p>",312

900,dog food storage,"<p>Read through these common questions to identify a few other key considerations when choosing the best dog food storage container.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to store dog food?</h3> <p>Ideally, dog food should be kept in its original bag, and the entire bag should be put in an airtight container. This offers an additional layer to keep the fats and oils in the food sealed in to keep it fresher. Keeping the bag also makes it easier to confirm the food’s expiration date and allows owners to view the lot number or UPC code in the event of a recall.</p> <h3>Q. Should dog food be stored in plastic containers?</h3> <p>Plastic storage containers are safe for storing dog food as long as they are BPA-free. BPA can leach into food and may lead to brain damage, an increase in blood pressure, or other health concerns.</p> <h3>Q.

901,dog toy storage,"<p>For more information about dog toy storage options and tips on how to train your pup to use the new toy box, keep reading to find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about dog toy storage.</p> <h3>Q. Where should I store my dog’s toys?</h3> <p>Store dog toys in a box, a bin, a lidded ottoman, or even in a closet or a cupboard. Decide if you want to choose a place that the dog can’t access without your assistance or leave the storage container in an area where the dog can help itself to a toy at any time.</p> <h3>Q. How do you organize dog toys?</h3> <p>Consider a product that has a lid and handles for easy portability. Look for storage options with a front cut-out that allows your pup better access to the toys or one with dividers to separate hard rubber toys from soft fabric toys. Keep in mind that only waterproof dog toys should remain outside. Water-absorbent toys may dry out, but they can become breeding grounds for mold and mildew.</p> <h3>Q. How do I train my dog to use a dog toy box?</h3> <p>Training a dog to use a dog toy box isn’t difficult, but like all trained behaviors, it does take time and consistency to achieve positive results.</p> <ol><li>Begin with the toy box between your feet and start playing a game of fetch. Each time the dog returns with the toy and drops it in the box, reward the dog with verbal and physical encouragement as well as a small treat. If you practice clicker training, then a click should also accompany the treat and encouragement.</li><li>Next, slowly begin moving the box farther away from your feet. Encourage the dog to continue returning the toy to the box, ensuring that a prompt reward is offered every time it follows through. Remember that patience and consistency are the keys to success.</li><li>Scatter multiple toys around the room, and repeat the process of encouraging the pup to return the toys to the box and then offering a reward.</li><li>Finally, scatter the toys around the house for your dog to find and return each of them to the box. This final test of the learned behavior may be a bit advanced for some dogs, but it can keep them occupied and stimulated while encouraging their natural hunting and foraging behavior.</li></ol> <p>Keep in mind that punishments during training are counterproductive and can lead to your dog fearing its toys, the toy box, and you. Always train with a consistently positive attitude so your dog is happy to be interacting with you. If frustration starts to bubble up, end the training session. It’s better to take a break than to ruin what you have accomplished.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a dog toy box outdoors?</h3> <p>Yes, you can use a dog toy box outdoors, but only if it’s made of a waterproof material like plastic or metal.</p>",486

Generally speaking, the term “bookshelf” refers to a single wall-mounted unit, while a “bookcase” typically encompasses several shelves that may or may not be built in.</p> <h3>Q: Which type of wood is best for bookcases?</h3> <p>Solid hardwood oak, maple, or walnut bookcases are a high-quality, sturdy choice. However, hardwood bookcases are heavy, challenging to move, and more expensive than those made with other materials. Plywood or wood veneers are a less costly alternative.</p> <h3>Q: How large does a bookcase need to be?</h3> <p>The number of books you own and the available space in your home impact the size of bookcase that’s right for you. To find a bookcase (or multiple bookcases) large enough to fit all your books, count the total number of books in your collection and estimate their average width. Multiply the average width by the total number of books to determine the amount of shelf space required.</p> <p>To determine shelf space, multiply the width of the bookcase by the number of shelves. For example, a 25-inch-wide bookcase with six shelves provides 150 inches of shelf space.</p> <h3>Q: Do bookcases need to be affixed to the wall?</h3> <p>No, bookcases don’t have to be affixed to the wall.

905,fountain pen,"<p>If you still have questions about fountain pens, the following answers to some of the most frequently asked questions may help.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a fountain pen and a ballpoint?</h3> <p>There are many differences between a fountain pen and a ballpoint pen, but the most important are the pen type and how they disperse ink.</p> <p>Ballpoint pens use a thick, oil-based ink that lasts a long time inside the pen and dries quickly, while fountain pens use a less viscous ink that flows smoothly but takes longer to dry.</p> <p>Ballpoint pens use gravity to push ink down a tube onto a ball that swivels in the socket at the end of the pen to distribute ink. Fountain pens also use gravity to help the flow of ink, but the ink travels to a collection site that ensures only a specific amount is available. The nib is separated by two tines or prongs. When pressure is applied to the nib while writing, the pressure forces the two prongs apart to disperse ink.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a fountain pen?</h3> <p>To use a fountain pen you can follow these simple steps.</p> <ol><li>Place the tip of the fountain pen, known as the nib, on the paper and rotate it slightly in your hand until you find the spot where the pen writes smoothly and without scratching or skipping.</li><li>Apply gentle pressure to force the tines or prongs of the fountain pen to open, allowing ink to flow onto the paper.</li><li>Use light strokes as you write to prevent damaging the nib or disrupting the ink flow.</li><li>After you feel comfortable with the basics, you can make adjustments to better suit your individual writing style.</li></ol> <h3>Q. How do you fill a fountain pen with ink?</h3> <p>The way to fill a fountain pen can differ depending on the type of pen.</p> <p>To change the cartridge on a cartridge pen:</p> <ol><li>Unscrew the cap from the pen and the barrel, or body from the nib, to remove the empty ink cartridge.</li><li>With the new ink cartridge, insert the small end inside the nib and push the cartridge into the nib until it clicks. This sound indicates that the inside of the nib has punctured the cartridge to access the ink.</li><li>Screw the barrel back onto the nib and the cap back onto the pen.</li><li>Sit the pen in a vertical position to allow gravity to pull the ink out of the cartridge and into the nib. It can take up to one hour before the pen is ready for use.</li></ol> <p>To refill a piston pen:</p> <ol><li>Remove the cap from the nib and the back of the pen to access the end knob.</li><li>Twist the end knob and extend the piston towards the front of the pen.</li><li>Dip the entire nib into the ink, covering the hole on the back of the nib, and turn the knob in a clockwise direction to draw ink into the chamber.</li><li>When the chamber is full you can turn the knob in the counterclockwise direction to let a few drops back into the bottle and remove air bubbles. Then, clean the nib with a cloth to remove excess ink.</li></ol> <p>Converter cartridges work in cartridge fountain pens, but either can be refilled like a piston pen following the steps above, or can be refilled using the steps below if it has an ink bladder mechanism:</p> <ol><li>Dip the nib into the ink and gently press the converter at the back of the pen.</li><li>Wait for air bubbles to appear in the ink, then slowly release the converter and allow ink to be drawn into the chamber.</li><li>Repeat as necessary until the pen is full.</li></ol> <h3>Q. How do you clean a fountain pen?</h3> <p>Cleaning a fountain pen involves the following simple instructions.</p> <ol><li>Remove the cap from the pen and unscrew the nib from the barrel or body of the pen. If your pen uses a cartridge or a converter cartridge, remove it from the nib section.</li><li>Rinse the nib under cool running water for a few seconds to wash away excess ink.</li><li>Place the nib in a cup of clean water to soak, replacing the water when it becomes saturated with ink.</li><li>Repeat step three as necessary until the water remains clean for at least an hour.</li><li>Remove the nib and let it dry completely. This can take up to 24 hours.</li><li>Reassemble the pen and use.</li></ol>",719
906,lego sets,"<p>The popularity of Lego sets endures because they are a quality product that captivates builders of all ages. Since the Lego Group continues to introduce new sets and institute new technology, you may have more questions.

907,pencil sharpener,"<p>If you have additional questions about pencil sharpeners or are wondering how they work, read on for answers.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen a pencil perfectly?</h3> <p>With a manual blade sharpener, place the pencil in the appropriate hole and use short, twisting actions to rotate the pencil until you reach the desired sharpness. With an electric pencil sharpener, insert the pencil into the hole and press down to engage the blades. Allow the blades to rotate for a few seconds, then remove the pencil to inspect the sharpness. Repeat if needed.</p> <h3>Q. How does an electric pencil sharpener work? </h3> <p>Electric pencil sharpeners often feature helical blades. These blades have sharp ridges that grind against the pencil, shaving away the wood and sharpening the core. A motor powered by a battery or electric cord causes the blades to rotate once the pencil is inserted into the sharpener.</p> <h3>Q. Why does my pencil sharpener not work?</h3> <p>There are many reasons a pencil sharpener stops working. Some culprits are loss of power, pieces of lead stuck in the blade, or an overfilled reservoir. Refer to your sharpener’s operation manual for more information.</p> <h3>Q.  Why does my electric pencil sharpener only sharpen one side?</h3> <p>The leading culprits for this issue are either the pencil was initially sharpened off-center or the sharpener itself is off-center.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a pencil sharpener?</h3> <p>To keep your pencil sharpener clean, empty the reservoir regularly and use canned air to blow away any lingering dust or debris from the blade.</p>",253
908,laminating machine,"<p>A few frequently asked questions about laminating machines follow. If any questions remain as to which product is the best laminating machine for you, the answers to these questions may provide some needed guidance.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between a hot and cold laminating machine?</h3> <p>Hot laminators use heat to seal thermal laminator film or pouches. The heat melts the glue on the plastic, sealing in the item being laminated. Cold laminators remove the wrinkles or bubbles from cold laminating pouches.</p> <p>One difference between a thermal laminating pouch and a cold laminating pouch is that cold laminating pouches are self-adhesive. Technically, they don’t need lamination to seal; however, without a cold laminator, air bubbles or creases will likely be present.</p> <h3>Q: Is the number of rollers really that important when choosing a laminating machine?</h3> <p>Yes, the number of rollers in a laminating machine is an important feature. Laminators with more rollers distribute additional heat and pressure to evenly and securely seal the items being laminated.</p> <h3>Q: What pouch thickness do I need for laminating?</h3> <p>The best pouch thickness varies, depending on what you’re laminating and your preferences. The thickness of a pouch is measured in mils. Some common thicknesses include 1.5, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 mils. Pouches with a lower thickness are more flexible, and those with a high thickness are more rigid.</p> <h3>Q: Should I cut before or after laminating?</h3> <p>It’s always best to cut documents before laminating them in order to ensure a completely sealed edge around the paper.</p> <h3>Q: Can you re-laminate existing laminated items?</h3> <p>Yes. If an older laminated document is peeling, you can re-laminate it without causing any damage.</p> <h3>Q: How much does a laminating machine cost?</h3> <p>Laminating machines vary widely in price, costing from $25 for simple home models to more than $1,000 for professional machines.</p>",304

Do you wet the brush before using acrylic paint?</h3> <p>When working with acrylic paint squeezed from a tube or poured from a jar, it is helpful to wet the paint brush first.

Clean brushes immediately after use with warm, mildly soapy water and rinse with clean water.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use watercolor brushes for acrylic painting?</h3> <p>Yes.

But there is much room for overlap, and many brushes work well for both media.</p> <h3>Q. How long do acrylic paint brushes last?</h3> <p>The answer to this question depends on the quality of the brushes, how frequently you paint, and how well you clean and care for the brushes after use.

How long does an eraser last?</h3> <p>The longevity of an eraser depends on its size and on how frequently it is used. Erasers that come with sliding sleeves or plastic storage cases should be stored in those protective containers to help them last longer.</p>",135
913,soft pastels,"<p>After buying new pastels, it’s time to make art. Here’s what’s important to know to get the most out of these new art supplies.</p> <h3>Q. Are soft pastels the same as chalk pastels? </h3> <p>Not exactly. Even though some soft pastels are labeled as chalk pastels due to their texture, soft pastels are better quality than true chalk pastels. Chalk pastels are made with cheap pigments and temporary binders, and they’re intended for uses like writing the menu on a chalkboard in a restaurant, not making art. Soft pastels feel like chalk, but they’re held together with a gum binder and richer pigment, so they can be used to make art that’s meant to last.</p> <h3>Q. What are soft pastels used for?</h3> <p>Soft pastels are a versatile medium for making art that’s a cross between drawing and painting. The pastels are held in the hand like a pencil, enabling color manipulation in a manner similar to what artists can do with paint. Think of soft pastels as a paint stick, providing the user a range of techniques to make marks on paper that give depth, vibrancy, and detail to art.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean soft pastels?</h3> <p>Because pastels are handheld, they get smudges of other colors on them. To clean them, put pastels in a plastic container that’s half-full of a light abrasive, like dry rice. Place a lid on the container and shake it for a few seconds. The rice gently scrubs off the mixed color on the pastel’s surface. Some artists use a paper towel to wipe off the sides of the pastel.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

For this purpose, most people only require a wood chipper with a 1.5-inch cutting diameter. Though, if you have older trees on your property, your wood chipper may need up to a 3-inch cutting diameter to handle the thicker branches.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a wood chipper?</h3> <p>Choosing a level location for it to sit. Once it is in position, set the parking brake on any equipment used to haul it, then adjust the chip deflector and chip chute so that they direct the chips to your desired location.</p> <p>Check the chipper for any debris before starting. If it is clear, start it up. If it isn’t, you will have to disconnect the spark plug and clean it out before turning it on. Never perform maintenance of any kind without disconnecting the power.</p> <p>With the engine started, feed material into the wood chipper, blunt end first. The machine will begin chipping away allowing you to back off and move to the side of the chipper so you don’t get hit by pieces that may shoot out. Once you have finished chipping, clean up the wood chips with a leaf blower or leaf vacuum, dispose of them, or put them to good use.</p> <h3>Q: How do you feed a wood chipper?</h3> <p>To feed material into the wood chipper, begin with the blunt end and carefully guide it into the chipper.

933,gas grill,"<p>Still wondering how gas grills work? Look below for answers to the most common questions about these outdoor appliances.</p> <h3>Q. What is a gas grill?</h3> <p>Gas grills use propane or natural gas to create a gas flame that either heats food directly or heats a grilling element that radiates heat to the food. Gas barbeques usually include two or three burners that sit below a metal grate that serves as the cooking surface.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a gas grill?</h3> <p>Choose a gas grill by determining what size is required, whether the grill will be fueled by natural gas or propane, and how much is in the budget. Since grills spend their lives exposed to the elements, pick a grill with high-quality parts, such as stainless steel or cast iron grates, and stainless steel or enamel-coated metal exteriors that will resist rust. Quality might cost more upfront, but it will pay off in longevity.</p> <h3>Q. Does a gas grill use charcoal?</h3> <p>Traditional gas grills do not use charcoal for fuel. Instead, they use propane or natural gas. Some dual-fuel models function as both charcoal grills and gas grills.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to season a gas grill?</h3> <p>It’s a good idea to season gas grill grates to create a protective layer against rust and prevent food from sticking to the surface. Season the grill by cleaning the grates, then cover them with a thin layer of oil. Allow the grill to cook the oil for about 30 minutes to season the grates.</p> <h3>Q. How do I cook on a gas grill?</h3> <p>Always preheat the grill by turning the burners on high and letting the grill heat up for 15 to 20 minutes. Once the grates are heated, clean them with a grill brush and then lightly coat the grates with oil. Next, add the meat. For steaks and burgers, sear the outer layer of the meat, giving it a nice dark-brown crust. For thinner meats, cook with the lid open, turning the meat several times during cooking. For thicker cuts and chicken, brown the exterior on both sides, then close the grill and reduce the heat to allow it to cook through to the desired temperature.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I clean grill grates?</h3> <p>Regular grillers should clean the grates thoroughly about every two months. This will preserve the grates while allowing the grill to cook more efficiently.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

937,riding lawn mower for hills,"<p>There is a lot to consider when choosing the best riding lawn mower for hills. For a quick reference to your most pressing queries, check out this frequently asked questions section to get more information.</p> <h3>Q: Are zero-turn mowers good on hills?</h3> <p>Zero-turn mowers have a high center of gravity and uneven weight distribution that make them a poor choice for mowing on hills.</p> <h3>Q: How do you mow a steep hill with a riding lawn mower?</h3> <p>Always mow up and down the slope in straight lines. Mowing parallel or executing turns on the slope increases the risk of a rollover accident.</p> <h3>Q: How do you mow a ditch with a riding lawn mower?</h3> <p>Keep the mower in low gear to reduce the possibility of running down the slope. Mow in an up-and-down pattern rather than along the length of the ditch. Excessively steep ditches should not be mowed with a rider.</p> <h3>Q: What is the steepest slope you can mow?</h3> <p>A good rule of thumb is to never use a riding mower on a slope greater than 20 degrees. Reduce this number to 10 degrees for zero-turn mowers as they are more prone to tipping over backward on steep hills.</p>",201
938,propane lantern,"<p>Now that you know more about propane lanterns and some of the most important features, you may have lingering questions about how to safely use a propane gas lantern. Read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about this type of camping equipment.</p> <h3>Q. What is the brightest propane lantern?</h3> <p>With a maximum brightness of 1,540 lumens, Coleman’s Northstar lantern is one of the brightest propane lanterns on the market.</p> <h3>Q. Do propane lanterns produce carbon monoxide?</h3> <p>Burning propane produces carbon monoxide, which is why you cannot safely use a propane lantern indoors. Like outdoor patio heaters, a propane lantern is only safe to use outdoors.</p> <h3>Q. Can you burn a propane lantern indoors?</h3> <p>No. You should never use a propane lantern in an enclosed space, including a tent. When burned, propane releases carbon monoxide into the air, which is poisonous and potentially deadly. Always burn a propane lantern outdoors where there is plenty of ventilation.</p> <h3>Q. How many cylinders should I bring for extras?</h3> <p>The number of cylinders depends on the length of the camping trip. A single 16.4-ounce canister of propane will last for about 12 hours, depending on the size of the lantern and the brightness of its setting. A large two-mantle lantern will last four hours on a single canister on a high setting, while a small single-mantle lantern may last close to 12 hours on a single canister.</p> <p>Consider how many nighttime hours you’ll need light. A five-day trip that requires about four hours of lantern use per night will require five canisters for a large lantern or two for a small lantern.</p> <h3>Q. Can the lantern flame blow out?</h3> <p>It is possible for a lantern to blow out, but it rarely happens. The lantern’s mantles and housing enclose the flame, preventing wind from blowing the flame out. If a lantern flame is blowing out, it may be an indicator of damage to the housing or a worn-out mantle.</p> <h3>Q. How long do propane lanterns last?</h3> <p>While propane lanterns last a long time when properly cared for, the mantles they use to cast their glow do wear out with regular use. The mantles generally need to be replaced about once a year.</p>",371
939,grill spatula,"<p>If you still have some questions about the best grill spatulas, this section is for you. It’s a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about grill spatulas. Be sure to check below for an answer to your question.</p> <h3>Q. What is a grill spatula used for?</h3> <p>Typically, backyard chefs use grill spatulas for placing, flipping, and adjusting meat on a grill grate. However, those with additional built-in features might also have a cutting edge, a flipping fork, or a bottle opener.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a silicone spatula on a grill?</h3> <p>Silicone is safe for use on grills, cast-iron pans, griddles, and a variety of other hot surfaces. However, most grillers prefer a stainless steel spatula, as it’s more useful for scraping scraps off the grill grates.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a rubber spatula on a grill?</h3> <p>Yes, but only if it’s specifically a heat-resistant rubber spatula. Always read the instructions on the tag; the material and heat-resistance level will be listed there. Rubber and silicone are different. While the spatula might feel like rubber, if it’s designed for use on a grill, then it’s probably made of silicone. Most rubber spatulas are intended for low-heat kitchen use.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a plastic spatula on a grill?</h3> <p>No, plastic spatulas can not handle the heat of a grill and will begin to melt with high-temperature exposure.</p> <h3>Q. What tools are needed for grilling?</h3> <p>A spatula is an absolute necessity, but a set of stainless steel tongs, a good grill brush, and a sturdy platter help to put together an excellent grilling tool kit.</p>",267
940,grill basket,"<p>There is a lot to consider when choosing the best grill basket. For a quick reference to some of the most pressing queries, check out the answers to these frequently asked questions for more information.</p> <h3>Q.

Virtually anything that can be grilled can go in a grill basket, from delicate slices of fish and thick slices of meat to mushrooms and onions.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep fish from sticking to a grill basket?</h3> <p>Many grill baskets come with a nonstick coating designed to prevent sticking. For noncoated varieties, apply a healthy amount of cooking oil to the basket before putting in the food.</p> <h3>Q. What is the correct way to use a grill basket?</h3> <p>Grill baskets sit directly on grill grates and allow heat to pass through. Simply place the seasoned and prepped food within and place it on top of the grill until it is thoroughly cooked.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean my grill basket?</h3> <p>Grill baskets are made to withstand high temperatures and tough conditions. These same characteristics make most grill baskets dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.</p>",199
941,pellet smoker,"<p>If you aren’t certain which product would be suitable for your next backyard barbecue, or if you are concerned about how to use and properly maintain your new pellet smoker, consider these frequently asked questions about pellet smokers.</p> <h3>Q. How does a pellet smoker work? </h3> <p>These cooking devices work by funneling wood pellets down through a hopper where they are pushed along to the firepot using an auger. The pellets are burned in the firepot, and the convection heat that is produced warms up the main cooking chamber for grilling or smoking.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain my pellet smoker?  </h3> <p>Pellet smokers should be cleaned before and after every use. In addition, they should be deep cleaned with a grill cleaner at least once per every 50 hours of cooking. In poor weather conditions, like rain, snow, or sleet, the pellet smoker should be protected by a waterproof grill cover. During the winter, move the smoker into a sheltered area to prevent snow from building up and rusting out its feet and wheels.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my pellet smoker last? </h3> <p>A pellet smoker will typically last between five and 15 years, depending on the frequency of use and how carefully it is maintained.</p>",204

This section contains some of the most frequently asked questions about the best exterior wood stains. Be sure to check for an answer to your question below.</p> <h3>Q. Will stain protect wood outside?</h3> <p>Exterior-grade wood stains will protect wood outside. These stains protect against moisture and UV rays.</p> <h3>Q. Is there a difference between interior and exterior wood?</h3> <p>Interior stains simply change the color of wood. They don’t offer much protection. Exterior wood stain protects against the sun’s UV rays and moisture.</p> <h3>Q. What type of stain do I need for exterior wood?</h3> <p>You need an exterior wood stain. Once you find a product, you’ll have a choice between colors, transparencies, and liquid bases.</p> <h3>Q. How do you prepare exterior wood for staining?</h3> <p>It’s best to remove any loose paint or finish with a scraper or by sanding. Then, pressure washing the surface followed by another quick sanding will free the surface from any additional contaminants. Once the deck is dry (unless the chosen product specifies otherwise), you’ll be able to stain your deck.</p> <h3>Q. How do you apply exterior wood stain?</h3> <p>Applying exterior wood stain is usually done with a brush, roller, or sprayer. It’s essentially the same process as painting:</p> <ul><li>Avoid lap marks by maintaining a wet edge.</li><li>Avoid pooling or running.</li><li>Work in one small area at a time.</li></ul>",245
943,flat top grill,"<p>Flat top grills are a great addition to any household, but you may still have some concerns about how they are used as well as questions about the differences between grills and other cooking devices. Read on to find the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about the best flat top grill.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a grill and a griddle?</h3> <p>Griddles and grills differ primarily by the sizes and textures of their cooking surfaces.</p> <p>Grills typically have large cooking surfaces with cooking grates that allow the juices and oils from the food to fall between the gaps and into the grill. Griddles are usually smaller than grills, though many resemble portable grills. Griddles have flat cooking surfaces without holes or gaps and are appropriate for sautéing or frying small or runny foods, such as eggs and mushrooms.</p> <h3>Q. Is a griddle healthier than a grill?</h3> <p>A griddle isn’t any healthier than a grill. In fact, a griddle often accumulates grease on its cooking surface, while a grill allows the grease to fall down into the catch basin. How healthy a griddled or grilled food is has more to do with the type of food, not the cooking method. If the goal is healthier eating, consider choosing grilled veggies over a porterhouse steak.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to clean my flat top grill?</h3> <p>Basic cleaning should be done before and after every use to keep the food tasting great and the grill working properly. To clean the grill, use the grill brush to remove stuck-on pieces of food, sauce, spices, and other burned food items. It’s also a good idea to empty out the grease tray so that it doesn’t overflow and cause a mess.</p> <p>For more robust cleaning, put away the grill tools and break out the grill cleaner and an abrasive scrubbing pad. Each piece from the interior of the grill, including grates, griddles, burner protectors, and the entire catch basin at the bottom of the grill, should be removed and carefully cleaned with a grill cleaner before being rinsed, dried, and returned to its position inside the grill.</p> <p>The exterior of the grill should also be cleaned on a semi-regular basis. Using a grill cleaner with water-resistant qualities will help protect the grill and keep it looking great.</p> <h3>Q. How do you take care of a grill?</h3> <p>To properly take care of a grill, follow these simple steps:</p> <ul><li>Regularly check the gas or electrical connection to ensure that there are no tears, breaks, or leaks.</li><li>Make sure the grill is properly covered when it isn’t in use to avoid damage from rain, snow, and ice.</li><li>Before and after every use, the grill should be cleaned. Depending on how frequently the grill is used, it should be deep cleaned with a grill cleaner semi-regularly to help ensure that it lasts for years.</li></ul>",479

To learn about the best type of oil for your snowblower, keep reading for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about snowblower engine oil.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use synthetic oil in my snowblower?</h3> <p>Yes, synthetic oil can be used, and it may be the best oil for a snowblower. Synthetic oils are refined to run cleaner, leaving fewer deposits in the engine. Many also include additives that clean grime and sludge from the engine to improve performance.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use car oil in my snowblower?</h3> <p>Yes. Snowblowers, like cars, are 4-cycle engines, so they use the same type of motor oil. Make sure to use a motor oil weight with a low-temperature viscosity rating, such as 5W-30.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know which oil is the right one for my snowblower?</h3> <p>Snowblowers operate in frigid temperatures, so the most important factor to consider is viscosity. Use motor oil with a low-temperature viscosity rating, such as 5W-30 or 5W-20, to ensure the snowblower starts easily and runs smoothly.</p> <h3>Q. What happens if I put too much oil in my snowblower?</h3> <p>Adding too much oil to a snowblower, or any 4-cycle engine, will cause the oil to rise and come in contact with other moving parts around the engine, aerating the oil and creating a huge mess.</p>",233

How does a pocket chainsaw compare to a camping ax or hatchet?</h3> <p>Each has its pros and cons. A pocket chainsaw is much lighter than a hatchet or ax, and it cuts through trees and branches more quickly. Hatchets and axes, however, are more versatile. They can turn on their sides and hammer in tent stakes, for example. They can also split large tree stumps, turning them into useful firewood.</p> <h3>Q. How long should a good pocket chainsaw be?</h3> <p>A pocket chainsaw should be at least 24 inches long to be easy to use. Shorter models can offer more cutting power by having more cutting blades per inch; longer 36-inch models with fewer cutting blades require less strength to use.</p> <h3>Q. How do I sharpen a pocket chainsaw?</h3> <p>Use a round file to sharpen a pocket chainsaw. Extend the chainsaw over a hard surface, such as a metal vice, and sharpen each blade individually by running the file against the blade perpendicular to the chain and at a 45-degree angle to each tooth. Run the file over each side of the tooth to create a sharp edge.</p>",221

Attach the sprayer to the hose, then run the sprayer to clear out the nozzle.</p>",341
949,above ground pool vacuum,"<p>Keeping the pool clean and crystal clear is easier with the help of an above ground pool vacuum. But if you aren’t completely sure how and when to use the pool vacuum, then take a look at the answers below to these and more frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I vacuum my pool? </h3> <p>You can vacuum the pool any time debris begins to accumulate at the bottom. For regular maintenance, plan to vacuum it at least once per week to help remove any excess dirt from the water.</p> <h3>Q. Is it OK to leave a pool vacuum in the pool? </h3> <p>It depends on the specific product. Some above ground pool vacuums are made to stay in the pool for an extended period of time, but generally, you should remove the vacuum after the pool is clean. Chemicals in the water can cause premature wear on the pool vacuum if it’s left in the water indefinitely.</p> <h3>Q. Why is my pool dirty after I’ve vacuumed it? </h3> <p>If the water is dirty after vacuuming, then this is likely an issue with the pool filter. During vacuuming, many dust and dirt particles can get kicked up by the movement of the vacuum, but a properly functioning filtration system should pull these particles out of the water.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean my above ground pool vacuum? </h3> <p>Spray down an above ground pool vacuum after use to remove excess dirt and debris and rinse away chlorine. For any type of pool vacuum, the steps are simple:</p> <ol><li>Remove any excess debris from the vacuum, vacuum bag, and brushes.</li><li>Clean the built-in filter (if applicable).</li><li>Wash any part of the vacuum that is exposed to pool water or debris from the pool.</li></ol> <p>A manual pool vacuum typically takes just a few minutes to properly clean. However, it takes more time to clean a robotic pool vacuum, as these models are larger and have brushes on the bottom and sides, which will need to be cleaned along with the filter and vacuum bag, if applicable.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my above ground pool vacuum last? </h3> <p>Above ground pool vacuums typically last between 3 to 5 years, depending on the frequency of use and if they are properly maintained.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

950,charcoal chimney,"<p>Wondering how to light your new charcoal chimney or what type of charcoal to use? Read on for answers to these and other frequently asked questions about these charcoal grill companions.</p> <h3>Q. How do I light a charcoal chimney?</h3> <p>You can light a charcoal chimney in a few ways. One option is to douse the charcoal in lighter fluid, allow it to soak in for a minute, and then light with a lighter. For charcoal starters with a space between the starter’s bottom and the grate holding the coals, you can use either a fire starter or even crumpled pieces of paper to start the charcoal chimney.</p> <h3>Q. What size charcoal chimney do I need?</h3> <p>The best way to determine the size of the charcoal chimney you need is to consider the size of the grill. For charcoal grills that are 22 inches or larger in diameter, use a starter that is 7.5 inches in diameter and about 12 inches tall. If the grill is larger, simply fill the chimney and add the additional coal to the grill. The lit charcoal will light the other charcoal once you’ve added it to the grill.</p> <h3>Q. Should I use lump charcoal or briquettes?</h3> <p>This choice is a matter of preference. Lump charcoal devotees like the fact that it contains no chemical additives (it’s essentially pure carbon), allows for easier temperature regulation, creates higher temperatures, and produces little ash. Briquette lovers prefer the uniform shape of briquettes, which makes them easier to arrange in the grill. Briquettes also burn longer than lump charcoal and cost less.</p> <h3>Q. How long should I leave the charcoal in the chimney before adding it to the grill?</h3> <p>It typically takes about 10 to 15 minutes for the charcoal to be lit enough to pour into the grill.</p>",300

952,towels on amazon,"<p>Once you’ve chosen the best towels for your needs, proper cleaning and care help keep your towels soft and absorbent for years to come. Keep reading for some frequently asked questions and answers about choosing and maintaining towels.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best type of towel for me?</h3> <p>The best type of towel for your needs depends on your personal preferences and budget. Consider factors like the towel material, texture, size, weight, and design when making a choice.</p> <h3>Q. How do I wash microfiber towels?</h3> <p>Follow the manufacturer’s washing directions. In general, microfiber towels should be washed in cold or warm water (not hot) using a gentle detergent. Wash microfiber towels only with other microfiber towels—other fabric types can make the microfiber fibers less effective. Also avoid using fabric softeners, which can gunk up a towel’s fibers.</p> <h3>Q. How do hotels keep towels fluffy? </h3> <p>First, they start with high-quality, fluffy towels with a higher GSM measurement (over 600 GSM is ideal). Hotels wash towels only with other towels to prevent lint transfer and use softer water, which usually makes fabric feel softer. They avoid ultra-high temperatures, which can damage fibers. Also, although it sounds counterintuitive, they usually avoid fabric softener, which can cause buildup on towels.</p>",206
953,outdoor showers,"<p>In the sections above we have provided details about the types of outdoor showers and their important features. We followed this up with real-world examples that illustrate the wide selection available. During our research we came across a number of questions of a practical nature, and we have answered those below.</p> <h3>Q. Is it expensive to build an outdoor shower?</h3> <p>Outdoor showers can be very affordable, and we have a budget-friendly solution here. Much depends on the materials used and the enclosure required. Prices can range anywhere from a few hundred dollars to upward of $10,000.</p> <h3>Q. Can I have an outdoor shower in a cold climate?</h3> <p>Yes, though some precautions may need to be taken. Portable showers can be used outdoors at any time, as long as they are not left to freeze with water in them. Permanent installations need frost-proof fixtures to prevent damage and should be drained down over winter.</p> <h3>Q. How do I make an outdoor shower with hot water?</h3> <p>In many cases a hot water pipe can be run from your existing household supply to an outside connection. If that’s not practical, there are solar-powered outdoor showers and those that can be hooked up to a propane gas tank for hot water supply.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a special shower head for outdoors?</h3> <p>No, though if it is going to be outdoors in all weathers, stainless steel or brass (which is often nickel- or chrome-plated) is recommended.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of pipe do I use for an outdoor shower?</h3> <p>Copper or PVC pipe can be used, depending on installation conditions. The pros and cons of each need to be investigated. Temporary outdoor showers can use ordinary garden hose.</p> <h3>Q. How do I make an outdoor shower with a garden hose?</h3> <p>At its most basic, all that’s required is a way to affix a shower head to a wall or post and fittings to attach the hose. A number of packages are available.</p> <h3>Q. How do I attach a shower head to a hose?</h3> <p>It’s a question of finding the right hose adapter. Many showerhead fittings are ½ inch in diameter, whereas garden hoses are typically ⅝ inch. However, it’s important to check. Garden hoses can be anywhere from ⅜ inch to ¾ inch. Adapters are widely available.</p>",382
954,sleeper sofa,"<p>If you have concerns about sleeper sofas that haven’t been addressed, keep reading to find answers to the most frequently asked questions about these sofas.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a sleeper sofa and a sofa bed?</h3> <p>Sofa beds are similar to futons, in that they lie flat using the existing seat and back cushions to create the bed. Sleeper sofas, on the other hand, use separate mattresses that are hidden in the frame of the sofa. The mattress pulls out to convert the sofa into a bed. Manufacturers often use these terms interchangeably, so don’t count on their descriptions.</p> <h3>Q: Can you sleep on a sleeper sofa every night?</h3> <p>You can sleep on a sleeper sofa bed every night, but it might not be as comfortable as a traditional bed. While today’s sleeper sofas are more comfortable than previous models, they do have thinner, lower-quality mattresses than standard beds, making them less appropriate for daily use. A sleeper sofa mattress also wears out more quickly than a traditional mattress.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean a sleeper sofa without a vacuum?</h3> <p>Use a clean, soft cloth to brush dirt and dust from the couch’s surface. Baking soda freshens your sofa or gets rid of odors. Sprinkle some baking soda on the couch, let it sit for about 20 minutes, and then wipe off the baking soda with a clean cloth. A solution of baking soda and water also treats spills and stains.</p>",243

You will need a fitting called a “dishwasher 90” for the water line; this is a 90-degree angled elbow that allows the water line to lie flat rather than bending at an angle.</li><li>Secure the electrical connections, and test the dishwasher for power.</li><li>Level the unit using a wrench on the “legs” underneath the dishwasher, and secure it in place with the screws that came with the unit.</li><li>Run the unit, checking for leaks; you may need to reclamp the hoses if there are any leaks.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How long does a dishwasher last?</h3> <p>Several variables affect a dishwasher’s lifespan, including how often you run the unit and how well you clean and maintain it. The average household runs about four to five loads per week. Dishwashers will typically last anywhere from 9 to 16 years, with an average life expectancy of about 12 years.</p> <p>Dishwashers with stainless steel tubs and spray arms usually last longer than units with plastic components. Professional maintenance and regular cleaning, such as wiping down the door seals, cleaning the food trap and filter, and pre-scraping or rinsing dishes, can extend the lifespan.</p> <h3>Q: What certifications should I look for in a dishwasher?</h3> <p>Energy Star–certified dishwashers reduce water use by up to 65 percent and energy use by more than 10 percent over non-Energy Star models. The CEE Rating is assigned by the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, a group that works with manufacturers to build appliances that reduce energy consumption. There are three tiers for CEE ratings, and a higher tier equates to a higher level of energy efficiency.</p> <p>NSF-certified dishwashers have an optional “sanitizing” feature that allows them to run at a very high temperature to kill 99 percent of bacteria. ADA-compliant dishwashers are designed to accommodate the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p> <h3>Q: How do you get rid of the bad smell in the dishwasher?</h3> <p>Sometimes, even the cleanest kitchens will be the source of funky smells. The dishwasher is often a likely culprit since food residue, grease, and grime can build up over time.</p> <p>To keep bad smells at bay, regularly clean the filter and food trap. Use a damp microfiber to wipe down the inner surfaces, spray arms, and racks. For a deeper clean, fill a glass with 1 cup of distilled white vinegar, and run the dishwasher through a single cycle using the hottest water possible. Repeat every few months to keep your dishwasher squeaky clean and odor-free.</p> <h3>Q: Which is better: dishwasher pods or powder?</h3> <p>The question of pods versus powder comes down to a few variables, but for maximum dishwasher performance, you need to use the correct amount of detergent. Because pods are premeasured, it takes some of the guesswork out of the process. Pods also are convenient, which is one reason they are so popular, with more than 70 percent of dishwasher detergent now sold in pod form. Pods are, however, pricer than powder.</p> <h3>Q: Are pods better than liquid?</h3> <p>Similar to the question of pods versus powder, measuring your dishwasher detergent is important. Some people use far too much liquid detergent, creating too many suds and leaving a cloudy film on dishes. Pods deliver a combination of convenience, cleaning power, and reliable measurement, but again, they cost more than liquid detergents.</p>",737

983,utility sinks,"<p>If you’re wondering if there’s a difference between a utility sink and a laundry sink, or how big a laundry sink should be, then read on for answers to some of the most common questions about these specialized plumbing fixtures.</p> <h3>Q: What are the benefits of a utility sink?</h3> <p>Utility sinks can meet a variety of needs. It’s ideal for hand-washing delicates and serves as a place to soak stained clothes. Larger, more rugged utility sinks, sometimes called slop sinks, are also ideal for rinsing out paintbrushes or filling large buckets that don’t fit under a kitchen sink faucet.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a laundry sink and a utility sink?</h3> <p>The difference between the two depends on the user. A utility sink is typically made from thermoplastic with a deep basin and metal legs and has a purely utilitarian look. For many, this style of sink is also suitable for their laundry room. Those with more sophisticated laundry rooms may use a laundry sink that has a larger capacity than a kitchen sink but isn’t as large as a utility sink. These sinks are usually made from stainless steel, which is more attractive and has either a cabinet base or is under-mounted to solid countertops.</p> <h3>Q: Is it necessary to get a utility sink for my laundry room?</h3> <p>While a utility sink is a nice accessory to have in a laundry room, it isn’t a necessity. One can also use a simple plastic basin filled with water to treat stained clothing or clean tools.</p> <h3>Q: Which type of sink is best for a utility room?</h3> <p>The best type of sink for a utility room is usually a floor-mount sink. These sinks offer the largest capacity of any utility sink, which makes them more versatile. They also are made from rugged plastic that resists wear and tear. Thermoplastic sinks are also more affordable than stainless steel models.</p> <h3>Q: What is a good size for a laundry room sink?</h3> <p>While laundry room sinks come in a variety of size options, most are about 23 inches wide and 20 inches from front to back, with a depth of at least 13 inches. These dimensions create enough volume for soaking clothes or filling a bucket for mopping the kitchen floor.</p> <h3>Q: Can I build a cabinet around my floor-mounted sink?</h3> <p>To make a utility sink look chicer, it is possible to build a cabinet around it. Just make sure to build in a door or leave an opening that allows for access to the plumbing for periodic maintenance or repairs.</p>",428
984,outdoor bar carts,"<p>Take a look at these frequently asked questions to learn more about outdoor bar carts and their uses.</p> <h3>Q. What do you need an outdoor bar cart for?</h3> <p>Like an indoor drink trolley, the outdoor bar cart holds everything necessary for making and serving drinks and bites outdoors. Many also double as grill tables or indoor carts, and options such as a bar cart with wine rack are a matter of personal preference.</p> <h3>Q. What do you keep in an outdoor bar cart?</h3> <p>Depending on the size of the cart, it might hold bottles of wine and spirits, sodas, and mixers as well as barware like shakers, glassware, an ice bucket, napkins, and plates of limes, along with essential bar tools like tongs and jiggers. Larger carts can hold platters of food, tableware, and utensils.</p> <h3>Q. What else can you use an outdoor bar cart for?</h3> <p>Some outdoor bar carts multitask as meal-prepping stations or even potting tables.</p> <h3>Q. How tall should an outdoor bar cart be?</h3> <p>Bar-cart height depends on the number of shelves. A two-shelf cart may be 29 or 30 inches tall, while a cart with three shelves might be as tall as 37 inches.</p> <h3>Q. How can I decorate my outdoor bar cart with plants?</h3> <p>To thrive, plants need sunlight, water and the right-size container. Place taller sun-loving potted plants on the top shelf and smaller shade plants on the bottom. Make sure to place a pot saucer or cork pad under planters to prevent damage to the surface of the cart.</p>",256
985,airless paint sprayer,"<p>Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about airless paint sprayers.</p> <h3>Q: Is spraying paint better than rolling?</h3> <p>Spraying can be better than rolling, but personal experience and preference impact which painting method is truly the best for you. Rolling is inexpensive, easy to set up, and relatively straightforward, making it the better choice for beginners.  Spraying comes with a higher up-front cost, and users will need to take the time to set up the airless paint sprayer, as well as cover any surfaces or items to make sure that airborne spray doesn’t accidentally paint the furniture or floor.</p> <p>However, when a paint sprayer is used by a skilled individual, the setup time dramatically decreases, and the actual paint job also takes less time than it would with a roller, so these tools are great for experienced tradespeople and DIYers.</p> <h3>Q: Do airless sprayers use more paint?</h3> <p>Airless paint sprayers do tend to use more paint than a roller or brush by about 30 percent. However, a skilled DIYer will save a lot of time on paint projects with an airless paint sprayer, so the higher consumption of paint is a fair trade for the time most people save.</p> <h3>Q: Do you have to thin paint for an airless sprayer?</h3> <p>It depends on the specific product. While small airless paint sprayers typically require thinned paint for proper use, some compact models have the power to use unthinned paint. Before deciding on a product, check the manufacturer’s recommendations to determine whether it can be used with full viscosity or thinned paint.</p> <h3>Q: How often do the filters need to be cleaned?</h3> <p>Filters last longest when you clean them after every use. It’s also a good idea to clean them before you use them if the sprayer has been sitting in your garage or workshop for an extended period of time. This will ensure there is no debris in the filter before you begin spraying.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean an airless paint sprayer?</h3> <ol><li>Fill a bucket with water for latex paints or paint thinner for oil-based paints.</li><li>Remove the intake hose from the paint and put the hose into the bucket.</li><li>Add 2 cups of water or paint thinner to a second bucket.</li><li>Remove and place the spray tip guard, tip, and filter into the second bucket for cleaning.</li><li>Reassemble the airless paint sprayer without the guard, tip, and filter.</li><li>Prime the pump and pump water or paint thinner through the system.</li><li>Use the spray gun to release the cleaning fluid and to flush any remaining paint from the system.</li><li>When all parts are clean, reattach the spray tip guard, tip, and filter.</li></ol> <p>While these steps give you the basic method of cleaning, always refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for product-specific differences.</p>",458
986,paint sprayer,"<p>Not sure whether buying a new paint sprayer is right for you? Read on to learn more from these frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need an air compressor for a paint sprayer?</h3> <p>Not necessarily. Airless paint sprayers use a pump to pressurize the paint, causing it to ionize at the spray tip. HVLP paint sprayers use airflow to ionize the paint, but they are powered by an onboard turbine. Neither of these types uses an air compressor. Pneumatic paint sprayers do require an air compressor.</p> <h3>Q: Do paint sprayers use more paint than a traditional roller?</h3> <p>Yes. Paint sprayers use up to 33 percent more paint than rollers or brushes.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a paint sprayer on interior walls?</h3> <p>Using a paint sprayer for interior walls can get the job done faster but may require more preparation. All furnishings should be covered, and the floor should be protected from overspray, splatter, and ionized paint particles that become a dusty film. Protect yourself, too, by wearing goggles, a respirator, and protective clothing such as coveralls.</p>",176
987,acrylic paint,"<p>Now that you’ve learned some of the important factors to consider when choosing the best acrylic paint for your collection of art supplies, questions may still remain. Any additional information about choosing and using your new paint is listed below.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between oil paint and acrylic paint?</h3> <p>Oil paint is traditionally made with drying oils from animal fat, synthetic polymer or linseed, making it hard to wash off or fade. Alternatively, acrylic paint is water-based and can be thinned, diluted like watercolor paints, or washed off.</p> <h3>Q: What surfaces can acrylic paint be used on?</h3> <p>Acrylic paint is suitable for canvases, paper, metal, fabric, glass, stone, and leather.</p> <h3>Q: Can acrylic paint be used outside?</h3> <p>In most cases, if unsealed, acrylic paint can wash off or fade if left outside due to exposure to moisture or rain. It is recommended to leave acrylic paint to dry for 3 weeks before potential exposure to moisture.</p> <h3>Q: Do you use water with acrylic paint?</h3> <p>As it is water-based, acrylic paint is acceptable to use with water. Usually, this causes the paint to thin and become more malleable for painting objects.</p> <h3>Q: Is acrylic paint washable?</h3> <p>Acrylic paint is washable. But, you may need to use a cleaning solution or soap for paint that has already dried.</p> <h3>Q: How do you seal acrylic paint on fabric?</h3> <p>Follow the paint manufacturer’s recommendation for heat-setting the paint. Most acrylic-based fabric paint manufacturers recommend allowing the painted fabric to dry for several hours before applying heat with an iron or a clothes dryer.</p> <h3>Q: How do you seal acrylic paint on glass?</h3> <p>It can be done either by baking in an oven (manufacturers provide specific instructions on the curing process for their paint) or by applying a coat of sealer. Apply with a paint brush or spray-on versions are available.</p>",308
988,chalk paint,"<p>Chalk paint has been around for 30 years, and it’s still as popular as ever, but the preparation, application, and finishing steps are a bit different from regular paints. With the best chalk paint, it’s easy to apply and get great results, but perhaps there are a few questions you want answered before starting your next project.</p> <h3>Q. What is chalk paint?</h3> <p>Chalk paint is typically a water-based paint that contains calcium carbonate and talc to achieve an ultra-matte finish.</p> <h3>Q. How do you get a smooth finish with chalk paint?</h3> <p>Use a brush specifically made for chalk paint and apply one to three coats for a smooth finish with no sanding necessary.</p> <h3>Q. How should you paint furniture with chalk paint?</h3> <p>Clean dirt and grease from the piece with a mild cleaner and dry the surface. Apply one to three coats of chalk paint. Read product directions for drying times.</p> <h3>Q. What happens if you don’t wax chalk paint?</h3> <p>Without wax, chalk paint will have a smooth, ultra-matte finish. Wax will add depth and a soft luster to the color and preserve/protect the finish.</p> <h3>Q. How do you remove chalk paint?</h3> <p>First, remove any wax with mineral spirits and a sponge. Then, remove the remaining chalk paint by scrubbing with steel wool and a follow-up sanding.</p>",217
989,paints for wood crafts,"<p>There is a lot to consider when shopping for the best paint for wood crafts, so it’s understandable if there are some lingering or specific questions. Below are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about paints used for wood crafting.</p> <h3>Q. How do I paint wood crafts?</h3> <p>Start by prepping the wood surface. If you are painting unfinished wood, wipe the dust away with a tack cloth, then paint. For finished wood, sand the surface first or use a primer before painting.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to seal wood before painting?</h3> <p>No. Typically, the wood is sealed after painting to help preserve the surface.</p> <h3>Q. Can I paint acrylic directly on wood?</h3> <p>You can use acrylic paint on unfinished wood surfaces. If the wood surface is finished, you will need to sand or prime the surface prior to painting.</p> <h3>Q. Are craft paint and acrylic paint the same?</h3> <p>Most craft paints are acrylic. However, craft paint can also be oil based or spray paint.</p> <h3>Q. How do I protect a newly painted surface?</h3> <p>Use a polyurethane sealer to protect a newly painted surface.</p>",186
990,interior paint,"<p>Before making a final selection, the following answers to frequently asked questions may provide additional insight into the optimal procedures for selecting the best type of interior paint for walls.</p> <h3>Q: What brand of paint do professional painters use?</h3> <p>Benjamin Moore and Sherwin-Williams are two of the best-selling brands on the market that are popular among professional painters.</p> <h3>Q: What paint colors are best for bedrooms?</h3> <p>The best colors for bedrooms are non-visually stimulating hues such as blues and greens or cool grays and neutral creams.</p> <h3>Q: What type of paint makes a room look bigger and brighter?</h3> <p>Light paint colors make a room look bigger and brighter.</p> <h3>Q: What is the 60-30-10 rule, and how do I use it to choose interior paint?</h3> <p>This rule states that 60 percent of the room should be a dominant color, 30 percent should be the secondary color or texture, and 10 percent should be an accent color. The room’s main color, the walls, should be 60 percent. Use the 30 percent or secondary color in the draperies, accent chairs, bed linens, or on an accent wall. The remaining 10 percent should be in the accent decor.</p> <h3>Q: Should I paint my ceiling and walls the same color?</h3> <p>Painting your ceiling and walls the same color will draw the eye up, creating the illusion of a larger room and higher ceilings. However, using a dark color can have the reverse effect and make a room look smaller and closed-in, especially if there isn’t enough natural light.</p>",253
991,chalkboard paint,"<p>Understanding the basics of chalkboard paint is an important step in ensuring your final product looks great and serves the purpose you intended. Here’s more information you might need before getting to work.</p> <h3>Q. Is there a difference between chalk paint and chalkboard paint?</h3> <p>Chalk paint is typically used on furniture to create a distressed, vintage look. Chalkboard paint creates an actual surface on which to write with chalk.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to apply chalkboard paint?</h3> <p>Start with a primer that will keep the chalkboard paint smooth and ensure good adhesion to the surface. Follow the directions on the paint’s container regarding using sponges, brushes, spraying, or more.</p> <h3>Q. Do you need to seal chalkboard paint?</h3> <p>The best chalkboard paints don’t need sealing of any kind; they just need 24 hours to a few days to cure before you can start writing on the surface.</p> <h3>Q. Do you have to put a top coat on chalkboard paint?</h3> <p>No. It is a very good idea to condition the final product, though, especially if you intend to write on it often. You can do this by rubbing the side of a piece of chalk all over the new board and then erasing it with either a dry eraser or a wet rag, as the manufacturer recommends.</p> <h3>Q. Is chalkboard paint washable?</h3> <p>Yes. Some paint manufacturers suggest using a dry eraser on chalkboard paint, though many say a wet sponge or rag will be fine for erasing the chalk.</p>",249
992,garage floor paint,"<p>If you still want more info about buying and using the best garage floor paint, read on for answers to some common questions about these products.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best type of paint to use on a garage floor?</h3> <p>Epoxy garage floor paint is the most durable, easiest to clean, and will last the longest.</p> <h3>Q: Is painting a garage floor a good idea?</h3> <p>Paint offers a simple way to upgrade this high-traffic area. Just make certain the garage floor is clean, dry, and in good condition before applying paint.</p> <h3>Q: Is latex paint a good choice for a garage floor?</h3> <p>Because latex paint dries quickly (often within a few hours) and doesn’t produce objectionable fumes, it can be a good choice for a garage floor that’s not exposed to weather, such as a garage that’s been converted to a family room. While it’s not as durable as acrylic or epoxy, it can be an attractive and affordable option.</p>",160
993,roof rake,"<p>For more information on the best roof rake for snow removal at your home, take a look at some of the most commonly asked questions and the detailed answers below.</p> <h3>Q: What is a snow rake for? </h3> <p>A snow rake or a roof rake is used to remove snow from single-story roofs without having to leave the ground. This makes it much easier and safer to keep the roof clear of snow and prevent ice dams from forming in the gutter system.</p> <h3>Q: Do roof rakes damage shingles? </h3> <p>The blade on a roof rake head can damage the shingles on a roof. This is especially true with aluminum rake heads, but this problem can be avoided if you invest in a roof rake with built-in wheels that allow the roof rake head to remain just above the surface of the shingles, instead of sliding down directly on the shingles.</p> <h3>Q:Do roof rakes prevent ice dams? </h3> <p>Just owning a roof rake doesn’t do much to prevent ice dams. You or someone else in the home needs to use the roof rake when it snows to remove the snow from the roof. If this task is completed the same day that it snows, then you can prevent ice build up in the gutter system.</p> <h3>Q: Do you need a roof rake for a metal roof? </h3> <p>Whether you need a roof rake or not depends on the amount of snow that naturally builds up on your home. Some houses have steep roofs that don’t collect a lot of snow, while others may have a gentle slope. Metal roofs can be raked with a roof rake to keep them clear of snow, but in most cases the snow will tend to slide off a metal roof without a problem. In fact, many homes with metal roofs actually need snow guards or snow fences to prevent piles of snow from sliding off and potentially hurting anyone standing nearby.</p> <h3>Q: When should you rake your roof? </h3> <p>It’s a good idea to rake the roof on the same day it snows, similar to the frequency with which you would clear your driveway. Keep in mind that freshly fallen snow is much easier to move than snow that has been allowed to melt and refreeze under the sun.</p>",380
994,gutter cleaner,"<p>This has been a solid primer on the best gutter cleaners, but you might still have some questions. This section is a collection of the most frequently asked questions about the best gutter cleaners, along with the corresponding answers. For more specific information, you can reach out to your kit manufacturer’s customer service department or check out these wacky tricks for cleaning gutters.</p> <h3>Q: Is there a tool to clean gutters from the ground?</h3> <p>There are plenty of options for cleaning gutters without a ladder. You can choose from a pressure washer kit, a wet/dry vacuum kit, or some claw kits.</p> <h3>Q: How much psi do I need to clean gutters?</h3> <p>Setting your pressure washer to 1,700 psi should do the trick. While you might find some stubborn grime needs a little extra attention, pressure higher than 1,700 psi usually isn’t necessary.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clear clogged gutters?</h3> <p>The tools recommended here will clear clogged gutters by either spraying them with high-pressure water, air, or a manual claw. Armed with one of these tools and some helpful tips, you shouldn’t have a problem cleaning your gutters.</p>",187
995,roofing nailer,"<p>If you’re still wondering about roofing nailers, then read on for answers to some of the most common questions about these tools.</p> <h3>What is the difference between a siding nailer and a roofing nailer?</h3> <p>Though they may look very similar, they cannot be used for the same purpose. Roofing nailers use different nails than a siding nailer. Roofing nails are about 1¾ inches long, while siding nails are approximately 2½ inches long. This means siding nails won’t fit into a roofing nailer.</p> <h3>What size air compressor do I need for a roofing nailer? </h3> <p>Air compressor output is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). Because they fire longer and thicker lower-gauge nails, roofing nailers need a higher CFM than finish nailers. You need a 4.0 CFM air compressor to power a roofing nailer, which equates to a model with a 6-gallon tank.</p> <h3>Which is better: roofing nails or staples? </h3> <p>While both staples and roofing nails offer the same level of wind resistance, roofing nails are generally easier to install correctly. This is because staples must be installed with the crown parallel to the length of the shingle. This can be tricky when maneuvering on a roof. Since roofing nails have round heads, there is no need to orient the head.</p>",210
996,gutter sealant,"<p>The information presented above no doubt clued you in about the various types of gutter sealants, how they work, and how to choose the best product for different challenges. During our research, however,  a number of questions came up regularly—we answer the most common ones succinctly below.</p> <h3>Q: How long does a gutter sealant last?</h3> <p>The type of gutter, prevailing weather conditions, and the type of sealant all impact longevity. If applied carefully while paying close attention to manufacturer instructions, it should last at least several years. Extreme cold or heat can reduce that time, but careful product choice can maximize durability.</p> <h3>Q: How do I remove old gutter sealant?</h3> <p>Use a caulk and sealant remover like Krud Kutter, mineral spirits, or lacquer thinner. Apply sparingly, allow to soak in, then lift with a putty knife or an old chisel. Apply more remover if needed and wipe with a rag until you have a smooth, clean surface.</p> <h3>Q: How long after rain can you put sealant on the gutter?</h3> <p>Some polyurethane sealants can be applied while moisture is present, though in general it is recommended that gutters are dry when sealed. This may vary depending on temperature but probably 2 to 3 hours after the rain stops.</p> <h3>Q: How do I remove gutter sealant from my hands?</h3> <p>It depends on the product, and instructions should be provided on the packaging. However, none of these sealants is particularly good for your skin so we recommend protecting your hands in the first place with nitrile work gloves. These are reasonably tough yet thin enough to allow for a good feel and not restrict your movements.</p>",273

The boot dryer does the rest.</p> <h3>Q: How long do boot dryers take to dry boots?</h3> <p>It depends on many factors, including how wet the boot is and the type of dryer you purchase. In general, the best boot dryers can dry up a soaking wet boot over the course of eight hours.</p> <h3>Q: Do boot dryers kill bacteria?</h3> <p>Yes, by creating a warm, dry environment, boot dryers help reduce the amount of bacteria inside of a boot.</p> <h3>Q: Can a boot dryer catch on fire?</h3> <p>Any electrical appliance can catch fire, but the best boot dryers have built-in temperature controls that will not allow the dryer to exceed a specific temperature (usually around 105 degrees Fahrenheit).</p> <h3>Q: How do you maintain a boot dryer?</h3> <p>Boot dryers don’t need a lot of maintenance. Simply wipe the surfaces down with a household cleaning wipe, and if your machine has a fan or air intake, vacuum it out to ensure it’s running as efficiently as possible.</p>",263

If you live in an area that sees a lot of annual precipitation, you may need gutters and downspouts to prevent rainwater from pooling around the base of the shed, potentially causing damage to its base or even causing water to leak inside of it.</p> <h3>Q. Do sheds need vents?</h3> <p>It’s a good idea to have vents in your shed to allow hot, moist air to escape. Vents prevent condensation from forming inside the shed, which could lead to mold growth.</p> <h3>Q. Do sheds come with floors? </h3> <p>That depends on the shed. Some come with floors, while others require you to purchase a floor kit to go with it. Most wooden sheds include floors, while most metal and plastic ones do not.</p>",325
1025,christmas tree bag,"<p>Holiday decoration storage can feel like a game of “Tetris.” Christmas tree storage bags get you ahead of that game. If you’re still not sure what type of bag you want or need, below are answers to some of the most common questions to get you started.</p> <h3>Q. Can I store my Christmas tree upright?</h3> <p>You can store your Christmas tree upright. Upright Christmas tree storage bags usually slide over the tree from the top, leaving the tree stand exposed. They typically have several straps that wrap around the tree to stabilize the branches.</p> <h3>Q. Where should I put my Christmas tree bag?</h3> <p>A garage, attic, or basement are often the easiest places to store a Christmas tree bag.</p> <h3>Q. Can I store something else in my Christmas tree bag?</h3> <p>If there’s room in the Christmas tree bag, many other items can be stored there with the tree. Buy a bag that’s a bit bigger than the tree to leave extra room for other decorations.</p>",165
1026,locks for storage units,"<p>It’s crucial to first consider what type of locking mechanism your storage unit uses before purchasing a lock. We have answers to common questions about placing locks on storage units.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need my own lock for a storage unit?</h3> <p>You typically need your own lock for a storage unit. Before purchasing a lock, check with the storage unit facility to see whether the units use a cylinder lock that you must purchase from the facility or if they require you to supply your own padlock.</p> <h3>Q. How do I secure my storage unit?</h3> <p>If your storage unit requires you to use a padlock (versus a cylinder lock), check the size of the hasp on the unit’s locking mechanism. Purchase a padlock with a shackle diameter and opening that’s just small enough to fit that hasp. The smaller the gap between the hasp and the lock shackle, the harder it is for a thief to access the lock with a bolt cutter or a pry bar.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of lock do you put on a storage unit?</h3> <p>That depends on the type of locking mechanism on the storage unit. If the storage unit uses a cylinder lock, you’ll likely have to purchase the cylinder through the storage facility. If the lock uses a hasp, you’ll need to purchase either a standard padlock or a disc padlock with a shackle size that fits the hasp.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best lock for an outdoor storage unit?</h3> <p>The best lock for an outdoor storage unit is the Master Lock 911DPF padlock. A plastic piece that covers the keyhole and a laminated body prevents water from getting inside the lock and potentially corroding the lock’s parts.</p> <h3>Q. What does a yellow lock on a storage unit mean?</h3> <p>A yellow lock typically means a storage unit is available for rental. Rental unit companies will place a red lock on a storage unit with delinquent rental fees, preventing the tenant from accessing their belongings until they pay their overdue rent.</p>",337

These bags can also store cords, small electronics, and a number of other items you might want to travel with.</p> <h3>Q. What is a TSA-approved toiletry bag?</h3> <p>To be TSA-approved, a carry-on toiletry bag must have a capacity of 1 quart or less. Each passenger is allowed to transport liquids, gels, and aerosols in travel-size containers that are each under 3.4 ounces in capacity.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a clear bag for toiletries?</h3> <p>The TSA does not specify that your 1-quart toiletry bag must be clear. However, if it isn’t made of transparent materials, you’re more likely to experience delays, as the TSA agents may need to open and examine the contents of your bag.</p>",174
1028,shelf liner,"<p>Shelf liners make your kitchen cabinets, cupboards, and drawers look better while also making them easier to clean. Here are some frequently asked questions about how to use and install shelf liners.</p> <h3>Q: Is shelf liner the same as contact paper? </h3> <p>Contact paper and shelf liners are both used for the same purposes. However, contact paper is classically thinner and malleable, while select shelf liners are thicker and made with vinyl, fabric, or plastic.</p> <h3>Q: Does shelf liner attract bugs? </h3> <p>As with any surface, if your shelf liners are cleaned regularly they should not attract bugs or pests.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a shelf liner?</h3> <p>Shelf liners are cut to size then placed inside a drawer or shelf. The liner may have an adhesive backing that will stick to the shelf or drawer bottom, or made with a non-slip grip material that prevents it from shifting.</p> <h3>Q: How do you cut a shelf liner?</h3> <p>Use a sharp pair of scissors or utility knife to cut shelf liners to the proper size.</p> <h3>Q: How do you keep a non-adhesive shelf liner in place?</h3> <p>Most non-adhesive liners have a non-slip underside that keeps it in place. But if you find that it still shifts, place a strip of mounting tape to one side of the drawer or shelf, then lay the cut piece of liner on top.</p> <h3>Q: How do you remove a shelf liner?</h3> <p>To remove an adhesive shelf liner, simply pry up one corner of the liner and peel it away. If it gets stuck in some places, apply warm air to the area with a hairdryer. This should loosen the adhesive and make it easier to remove the liner.</p>",281

1032,utility knife,"<p>Utility knives serve various cutting needs, from opening shipping cartons and cutting away plastic zip ties to scoring drywall to make precise breaks. Today’s models are sturdy and safe, and some offer added onboard blade storage and cord/wire cutters. Still, those looking to invest in a utility knife likely have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between an EDC knife and a utility knife?</h3> <p>An everyday carry (EDC) knife features an attached knife blade and may have added functions, such as a bottle opener or a corkscrew. A utility knife uses changeable razor blades and is designed more for work than leisure.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a box cutter and a utility knife?</h3> <p>The terms are used interchangeably, although some refer only to old-style (fixed-blade) utility knives as box cutters.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best length for a utility knife blade?</h3> <p>Utility knives accept standard utility razor blades that measure 2.4 inches across and 0.75 inches high. Only the outer ¼ inch of the blade protrudes from the utility knife casing when in use. The rest of the blade is secured in the knife case for stability.</p>",191
1033,axe for splitting wood,"<p>A shiny new axe doesn’t come without a learning curve. If you’re new to splitting, there may be some new or lingering questions. To make it easier, we’ve answered a few popular questions to make sure you’ve got the right axe for your needs and know how to take care of it.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of maintenance does an axe require?</h3> <p>If you use the axe frequently, you may need to sharpen it regularly. Watch for signs of rust because nicks are fairly common. To prevent rust, oil the head before putting it in the sheath. Wood-handled axes may also need periodic oiling to maintain the strength and appearance of the wood.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a splitting maul, splitting axe, or hatchet?</h3> <p>Splitting mauls are generally larger with a maul head that can act as a hammer or be hammered once it’s wedged in a large round. Splitting axes typically have sharper heads and don’t have the maul head. They might have a flat backside for hammering and a shorter handle. If you need an axe for more than splitting, a splitting axe offers more versatility. Hatchets are shorter than either splitting mauls or splitting axes. They’re a good choice if you only need to split occasionally for camping trips or backyard fires because they’re easier to store and swing.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best axe for splitting wood?</h3> <p>If the only thing you’re doing is splitting, a splitting maul or splitting axe work best. Splitting mauls are more efficient for large rounds, but their weight and length require strength and practice. If you need an axe that’s close to maul without the heavy maul head, take a look at the Fiskars X27 Super Splitting Axe. Splitting axes aren’t as efficient on large rounds, but they work well for splitting standard rounds, making kindling, and general-purpose uses.</p>",308

1035,tape measures,"<p>Tape measures are found in most homes, workshops, tool boxes, and tool belts, and for a good reason—there’s always something that needs measuring, it seems. Still, different types of tape measures are better suited to some tasks than others. Those looking to find the best tape measure for a specific project are likely to have some questions.</p> <h3>Q. What is the black diamond on a measuring tape for?</h3> <p>Small black triangles appear every 16 inches on many measuring tapes to denote standard 16-inch on center (O.C.) measurements between studs. Small black diamonds appear every 19.2 inches, another standard spacing for wall studs or floor joists, although 16-inch O.C. is the most common.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need an automatic locking tape?</h3> <p>It sure is handy, but you don’t need it. You can always engage the manual lock if the tape doesn’t automatically lock when you pull the blade out.</p> <h3>Q. What are the most common sizes of tape measures?</h3> <p>With tape measures, 25 feet is the most common length, although some are as short as 12 feet, and others are 30 feet or longer.</p> <h3>Q. Are laser distance measurers worth the price?</h3> <p>It depends on how they’re used. They’re typically accurate to around ¼ of an inch, which is suitable for figuring wall space. However, they’re not accurate enough for woodworking. Real estate agents, appraisers, and engineers often find laser tape measures worth the money.</p> <h3>Q. Which is more accurate, a tape measure or ruler?</h3> <p>They should be equally accurate—the difference is that a tape measure is accurate over a longer distance.</p>",261

What kind of cuts can a circular saw make?</h3> <p>Circular saws can make straight cuts, cuts with beveled angles, and even a series of thin, shallow cuts known as dadoes or rabbets.</p> <h3>Q. What should I look for when buying a circular saw?</h3> <p>There is a combination of things to look for when buying a circular saw. If you already own a series of batteries, find one that matches your stash. Also, look for one with enough speed to get the job done that also fits your budget.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best circular saw for home use?</h3> <p>There are two saws worth recommending for home use. Both the Makita 7-¼-inch circular saw and the DeWalt 7-1/4-Inch circular saw are some of the best circular saws for a variety of projects, including those DIYers are most likely to tackle.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep a circular saw straight?</h3> <p>The best way to keep a circular saw straight is to clamp a straight edge to the workpiece and run the base against it. Another idea is to place a small clamp on the front of the base to act as a guide.</p> <h3>Q. Why am I getting kickback on my circular saw?</h3> <p>Kickback can occur for a few reasons:</p> <ol><li>Don’t start the saw with the blade against the workpiece. Allow the blade to get up to speed before pushing it through the workpiece.</li><li>Semi-cut workpieces tend to droop, and this droop can cause sideways friction on the blade, pinching it in place. Support the workpiece until the cut is complete.</li></ol>",341
1045,palm sander,"<p>Sanders are essential tools, even if they sit for long periods of time between uses. When sanding needs to be done, it needs to be done well. With two primary types of handheld sanders—random orbit and palm sheet sanders—figuring out which tool works best at which application can require some work.</p> <h3>Q. Is a palm sander or an orbital sander better?</h3> <p>A random orbit sander is regarded as being the better of the two tools. While the square pad on a palm sander may enable getting up close to something like an inside corner, random orbit sanders generally remove more stock. Plus, the randomness of their orbits are harder to detect in a finished piece and are less likely to telegraph through a finish.</p> <h3>Q. Is a sheet sander the same as a palm sander?</h3> <p>Yes, a sheet sander and a palm sander tend to be used interchangeably to describe the same tool that holds typical sandpaper to the tool with a wire clamp. It is unlike the hook-and-loop pads of random orbit sanders.</p> <h3>Q. What brand of palm sander is the most powerful?</h3> <p>All sanders are incredibly close as far as their capability for stock removal and finish. However, unscientifically, the SKIL 1/4 Sheet Palm Sander seemed to be the most aggressive at removing stock.</p>",216

The following sections aim to answer those queries, as they’re a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about staple guns.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of staple gun is best for wood?</h3> <p>If you’re stapling something thin or light to wood, the DEWALT DWHTTR350 is one of the best staple guns on the market.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a staple gun for carpet?</h3> <p>You can, but make sure you use long enough staples to make it through the pile, and that the staple gun has the power to drive them into the wood. Otherwise, loose staples will find their way into bare feet.</p> <h3>Q: What type of staple gun is the most powerful?</h3> <p>Construction staplers are definitely the most powerful. These models fire thick, heavy-gauge staples into construction lumber, so they have to pack a punch.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use regular staples in a staple gun? </h3> <p>The size and type of staples required for your staple gun will depend on its brand and model. To determine what size of staple you need, please consult the manufacturer of your staple gun.</p> <h3>Q: How many staples are in a staple gun? </h3> <p>The average staple gun can hold up to 210 staples.</p>",225
1047,mechanic tool set,"<p>Before you’re ready to buy your mechanic tool set, you may have some lingering questions that need to be addressed. See below for helpful responses to three of the most frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: What tools do mechanics use most often?</h3> <p>Thebest mechanic tool set will typically include a few essential tools, including a hammer, tape measure, screwdrivers, ratchet and socket sets, as well as a wrench set, pliers, and a pry bar. Mechanics use quality tools both for professional use and to complete their own automotive repairs.</p> <h3>Q: What mechanics tools should you carry in your car?</h3> <p>Unfortunately, cars can break down while you are driving, so it’s a good idea to invest in a small mechanics tool set with some essentials for handling minor problems. Keep screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrenches, and sockets available in this mechanics tool kit, but also pack jumper cables, a jack, a tire iron, a spare tire, and a 12-volt air compressor, so that you are well-equipped in the case of an emergency.</p> <h3>Q: Why does the price of mechanic tool sets vary so much?</h3> <p>The main reason for the price fluctuation between different mechanic tool kits is the number of parts included in the kit, though the brand and the type of tools also factor into the price. So, if you are looking at a Craftsman tool set with more than 100 pieces, then it’s likely to be more expensive than a DeWalt mechanics tool kit with just 10 pieces. Unless the 10 pieces happen to be specialized tools. In which case, the DeWalt mechanics tool kit may be the premium option.</p>",269
1048,home air compressor,"<p>Don’t buy products before all of your questions have been answered. Take a look at these frequently asked questions about air compressors and their answers below.</p> <h3>Q. How does an air compressor work?</h3> <p>An air compressor converts power into potential energy in the form of compressed air, using an electric motor or gas engine. Air is forced into the tank, where the pressure begins to build. Once the pressure within the tank reaches the tank’s upper safety limits, it shuts off until the air is released or used with a pneumatic tool.</p> <p>When used, the air compressor provides a burst or stream of powerful, compressed air to fire nails from a nail gun, spray paint from a sprayer, or loosen automotive fasteners with a ratchet and socket. The tank will then begin repressurizing until it returns to its upper-pressure limits. To shut down the air compressor, simply turn it off and release the compressed air with the ASME safety valve. When the PSI has been lowered to 10, release the drain valve at the bottom of the unit to allow any accumulated moisture to drain from inside the tank.</p> <h3>Q. What size air compressor do I need?</h3> <p>The size of the air compressor and tank depends on the type of work you will be doing:</p> <ul><li>Jobs that require small, intermittent bursts of air, like finish nailing, are easily tackled with a small home air compressor.</li><li>If the requirements of the job call for a more powerful air compressor, consider sticking with a smaller tank but upgrading the PSI and CFM rating. After all, a tank is only useful if the pump and motor can keep up with the job.</li><li>Spray painting calls for a 20- to 80-gallon tank because the output of pressurized air during spray painting needs to be continuous.</li></ul> <h3>Q. What projects require a home air compressor?</h3> <p>A home air compressor is a versatile tool you can use for many different projects. A small finish nailer can be powered with an air compressor to quickly and easily replace baseboards or door frames. The air compressor could also be paired with a cut-off tool to cut through metal sheets for automotive maintenance or duct repair.</p> <p>You can also use these incredible tools with pneumatic drills, frame nailers, and sprayers. They can even be used with an air ratchet to apply additional torque to stuck nuts or bolts. As long as you can power a tool with compressed air, you can use it, though the correct size and power output will depend on the project.</p>",423
1049,miter saw stand,"<p>Even though it might seem like an overwhelming amount of information on stands meant for miter saws, there could still be some questions floating around. The following section aims to answer those questions, so be sure to look for an answer to your question below.</p> <h3>Q. Is a miter saw stand necessary?</h3> <p>Most folks who use a miter saw would say yes. Working on the ground, a table, or some other makeshift surface can easily result in mistakes, especially when dealing with long pieces of lumber or metal. In addition, working with a saw that isn’t set to the right height can leave you with lingering back pain.</p> <h3>Q. How do you mount a miter saw onto a stand?</h3> <p>A miter saw is mounted using the brackets and hardware kit that is included with a miter saw stand. The brackets are connected to the stand, acting as a base for the miter saw. The holes in the four corners of the miter saw are then aligned with the brackets, and the bolts are placed through the holes and fastened with nuts. This provides secure placement of a miter saw that gets regular use.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a miter saw stand for a table saw?</h3> <p>Yes—but don’t! Technically you can use a miter saw stand for a table saw, but experts wouldn’t recommend this. Whenever you’re using any power tool, it’s best to be extra cautious to avoid possible injury.</p> <p>Putting a table saw on a miter saw stand can be dangerous. A miter stand is built to withstand a vertical force, not a horizontal force, making it likely that a miter saw stand would tip over if used to support a table saw. Invest in a separate table saw stand, or build one yourself if you have the skill set, rather than take the risk.</p>",306
1050,ladder,"<p>For more information about the best ladder, check out these answers to some of the most common questions. If additional concerns arise, contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best ladder brand?</h3> <p>Little Giant Ladder, WolfWise, and HBTower are trustworthy brands that produce some of the safest ladder options.</p> <h3>Q: Which is better, a fiberglass or aluminum ladder?</h3> <p>Aluminum is the lightest option and least likely to corrode. But this metal is among the most effective conductors of electricity. That means you shouldn’t use metal ladders for electrical work or near electrical lines.</p> <p>Fiberglass, while heavier than aluminum, is stronger and more versatile. It’s nonconductive, so you can use fiberglass ladders for both electrical and nonelectrical applications.</p> <h3>Q: What is the maximum height I can work from a ladder?</h3> <p>An adult standing can usually reach no more than 4 feet higher than the height of the ladder (i.e., you can reach an 8-foot ceiling from a 4-foot-tall ladder). Consider how you intend to use the ladder and the heights involved in your jobs. Then subtract 4 feet to determine the appropriate ladder height.</p> <h3>Q: How do I pick a ladder size?</h3> <p>An appropriately sized ladder has enough height that you don’t have to reach too much or stand on your toes. Reach height (the highest point a person can safely access while standing on the ladder) can be more or less than the height of a ladder and varies by type:</p> <ul><li>Step, platform, and A-frame: ladder height, plus 4 feet</li><li>Multi-position: ladder height, plus 1 foot</li><li>Extension and telescoping: ladder height, minus 1 foot</li></ul> <p>For instance, most adults can reach an 8-foot ceiling using a 4-foot step, platform, or A-frame ladder. To access first floor gutters (usually 11 feet high), a ladder between 7 and 12 feet is typically sufficient.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best ladder for home use? </h3> <p>The Little Giant Ladders step ladder is a versatile step ladder that’s engineered to be safe without being expensive. The 12.5-foot WolfWise telescoping ladder is sturdy, lightweight, and retracts to a quarter of its size for compact storage. One of the best multi-position models is from Little Giant Ladders, with extensive reach and adjustable A-frame, extension, trestle and plank, staircase, and 90-degree configurations.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

1051,moisture meter,"<p>Before buying a new moisture meter, take a look at the most frequently asked questions and their answers below.</p> <h3>Q: How does a moisture meter work?</h3> <p>Pin moisture meters work by measuring the resistance an electrical current meets when passing through a material. Inserting the pins into the material sends a current down one pin to flow into the second. The meter then measures the resistance the current met traveling through the material between the pins to generate a moisture reading.</p> <p>Pinless moisture meters use a high-frequency signal to permeate the material. The electrical signal changes based on the material’s ability to hold a charge, and the moisture meter receives a measurement of the moisture content in the material.</p> <h3>Q: What is a normal reading on a moisture meter?</h3> <p>In general, a reading of 5 to 12 percent is optimal, but a normal reading on a moisture meter depends on the material. Drier materials like drywall should have lower moisture readings of around 5 to 7 percent. Damp materials like wall studs and framing lumber have acceptable moisture levels of up to 12 percent.</p> <h3>Q: What is a bad moisture meter reading?</h3> <p>A bad moisture reading would be one that climbs to 20 percent or higher—in this environment, your porous materials like lumber may be susceptible to mold growth or decay.</p> <h3>Q: Does moisture in walls mean mold?</h3> <p>Not necessarily. A moisture meter can be used to help detect problem areas, but it cannot detect mold. The hope is that you would use the moisture meter to detect a leak before the mold can form. But if the moisture is left untreated, it can become the perfect environment for mold spores to flourish.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a moisture meter on drywall?</h3> <p>To use a moisture meter for drywall, first ensure that the meter is calibrated to accurately measure moisture in the material. If the meter is not calibrated, the results will be inaccurate.</p> <p>Once the meter is calibrated to test drywall, operate the moisture meter normally according to product instructions. Insert pin meters into the drywall in several different spots to get an accurate reading of the entire wall. Similarly, a pinless meter should scan several sites on the wall for a full scope of its moisture content. For drywall, a reading of 5 percent to 7 percent is optimal.</p> <h3>Q: Are moisture meters accurate?</h3> <p>A dependable moisture meter may boast an accuracy within 3 percent of the reading, with some professional-grade models getting within 0.5 percent.</p> <p>The accuracy of a moisture meter varies depending on the material you are testing, the calibration of the meter, the type of moisture meter, the procedures used during the test, and the meter’s functionality, which can vary based on upkeep and maintenance of the unit.</p> <p>Above all, a moisture meter for walls and other structures will be most accurate if used correctly. A high-quality moisture meter used on the correct material by an experienced DIYer can accurately measure moisture to within 0.1 percent. However, an inexpensive moisture meter used on an inappropriate material without a proper scale could return inaccurate readings in the same way that a poor-quality stud finder can fail to find a stud if used improperly.</p>",538

1053,winter work gloves,"<p>There’s a lot going on between the layers of winter work gloves. Here are answers to some of the most common questions about these cold-weather necessities—but if you want even more specific info, reach out to the manufacturers.</p> <h3>Q. What material is warmest for work gloves?</h3> <p>Wool is by far the warmest material for gloves, but it isn’t as durable as others when it comes to working with your hands. Wool is easy to puncture and doesn’t hold up well to abrasions.</p> <h3>Q. Are leather gloves warmer than wool?</h3> <p>Nope, wool is warmer than leather, as it does the best job of trapping body heat and also insulating, even when wet.</p> <h3>Q. How do I keep my fingers warm in work gloves?</h3> <p>Make sure your gloves aren’t too tight, so you’ll maintain blood flow to your fingers. Don’t squeeze your hands too tightly when using tools, and keep your hands and fingers as dry as possible.</p>",156
1054,power tool set,"<p>Take a look below to find the answers to several of the most commonly asked questions about selecting and handling a power tool set.</p> <h3>Q: What tools need to be included in a power tool set?</h3> <p>While there are no specific tools that need to be included in a power tool set, some of the most common tools include a hammer drill, reciprocating saw, circular saw, a flashlight, and an impact driver.</p> <h3>Q: Which brand is best for power tools?</h3> <p>Big power tool brands regularly improve their products and release updated tools and tool kits, so it’s difficult to state just one top brand. However, some of the best power tool brands include Ryobi, DeWalt, Bosch, Porter-Cable, Makita, and BLACK+DECKER.</p> <h3>Q: Where should power tools be stored?</h3> <p>To keep the power tools in good condition, store them in a dry location that won’t be subjected to extreme heat or cold. Consider storing your power tools in a garage, workshop, or basement.</p> <h3>Q: How do you clean power tools?</h3> <p>Power tools can be cleaned with a mixture of hot water and an all-purpose cleaner/degreaser. Simply combine the water and cleaner in a bucket, then use a wire brush or steel wool with the cleaning solution to lightly scrub the tools. This will remove dirt, rust, and other debris.</p> <p>You can also use a toothpick or cotton swab to clean in narrow cracks and crevices. Just make sure to disconnect the battery or power cord before cleaning to avoid accidentally turning on the power tool.</p>",253
1055,respirator,"<p>Respirators are a popular topic, but there are still some gray areas concerning them. If you’re not exactly sure about your new respirator, it’s probably for a good reason: a lot goes on inside those filters and masks. These are the most frequently asked questions and answers concerning the best respirators.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know if my respirator fits?</h3> <p>You should check positive and negative pressures every time you put your respirator on. For positive pressure, block the exhalation valve with your hand and exhale. Air should not be able to escape. To check negative pressure, block the filters or ports with your hands and inhale. Again, air should not be able to get in through the seals.</p> <h3>Q. How long is a respirator likely to last?</h3> <p>A filter can last five years if unopened and six months if opened. If you use your filter, change it daily. In regard to the respirator itself, the lifespan varies depending on maintenance. If there are no tears in the straps or seals and it passes the fit test every time you put it on, the respirator is fine.</p>",187
1056,small flashlight,"<p>Take a look below at the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about small flashlights.</p> <h3>Q. How many lumens should a good flashlight have?</h3> <p>Small flashlights can have less than 100 lumens and still be useful for illuminating nearby items, but if you are looking to brighten up an entire path or campsite at night, you will want a flashlight with at least 500 to 1,000 lumens. You can have higher lumens than 1,000, but it may not be necessary and can lead to a shortened battery life.</p> <h3>Q. How do you fix a small flashlight? </h3> <p>One answer is that you don’t. Small flashlights are inexpensive, and many times the repair can cost more than just replacing it. However, if you want to attempt some necessary maintenance, you should start with replacing the batteries. If this doesn’t seem to fix the issue, try cleaning the contact plate, which can have built-up rust and grime.</p> <p>Another quick repair you could attempt before taking the flashlight to a professional repair shop is to restore flexibility to the springs to ensure that power is running through them from the battery. Springs can get compressed, leaving gaps that cause malfunctions. If this does not work, take the flashlight to a repair shop or replace it.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best type of flashlight for home use?</h3> <p>The best type of flashlight for use around your home would be an LED, cable rechargeable flashlight. This is because charging cables have many places to be plugged in at home, ensuring that your flashlight is always ready. Also, LED bulbs are currently the easiest to find, have a very high lumen output, and are relatively inexpensive, making them the best option for general home purposes.</p>",291
1057,whittling knife,"<p>Tackle your next whittling project with as much information as possible with these answers to common whittling knife questions.</p> <h3>Q. How do you whittle wood?</h3> <p>All you really need to do to whittle wood is pick up a whittling knife and a piece of wood. The wood can be a high-quality block from your local hardware store or it can be as basic as a piece of a tree branch. Take the knife and begin whittling away pieces of wood until you can form something relatively similar to your vision.</p> <p>Whittling is an inexpensive hobby to get started in, and you don’t need any experience. However, you should wear gloves, go slow, and protect your hands at all times to prevent cutting up your fingers, and especially the pad of your thumb, which often takes the brunt of slips and nicks during whittling.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen your whittling knife blade?</h3> <p>There are many different ways to sharpen a whittling knife, but the most common method employs a sharpening stone. Lay the blade of the knife flat on the stone, then angle it just slightly while pushing the knife away from you, as though you were trying to cut a piece off of the sharpening stone. Alternately, you can lay the blade flat on the stone with a slight angle, then sharpen the knife by applying pressure to the blade and moving the knife in a small circular motion against the stone.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a pocket knife for whittling?</h3> <p>You can absolutely use a pocket knife for whittling. Some pocket knives even have multiple blades that you can use to create a variety of cuts on your whittling project.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between wood carving and whittling?</h3> <p>Wood carving is much more involved than whittling. You use chisels and gouges and might use mallets or power tools to carve the wood. Whittling is done completely with a whittling knife.</p>",324
1058,pocket hole jig,"<p>If you’re wondering how to set up a pocket jig or what type of jig you should purchase, read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these handy woodworking tools.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a pocket hole jig? </h3> <p>When deciding on which pocket hole jig to buy, consider how you’ll use it. If you’re an avid DIYer or pro woodworker who plans to use a pocket jig regularly, purchase a higher-end model that will allow you to work more quickly. For occasional use, there’s no need to splurge on an expensive pocket hole jig. Instead, go for a more affordable model. If most of your projects take you away from your home workshop, consider purchasing a compact and lightweight pocket jig that’s easy to carry to and from the job site.</p> <h3>Q: How do I set up a pocket hole jig? </h3> <p>Begin by attaching the stop collar onto the drill bit. Set the collar to the thickness mark that matches the thickness of the workpiece. Position the sliders on the jig so that they also match the thickness of the workpiece. Clamp the jig to the piece, making sure to align the guides for the holes to the correct position on the workpiece. Insert the bit into a drill and drill the holes.</p> <h3>Q: How close together can you put pocket holes? </h3> <p>Jigs with more than one guide hole have the holes automatically spaced apart. The distance between the center of one hole to the center of the adjacent hole is typically about 1 inch.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a pocket hole jig on a 2×4? </h3> <p>Begin by setting the stop collar on the drill bit and the sliders on the jig to 1½ inches, which is the actual thickness of a 2×4. Attach the jig to the end of the 2×4 using a clamp, making sure to center the jig. Once secure, use a drill with the jig drill bit to make the pocket holes.</p>",333
1059,corded drill,"<p>With a cordless drill already in your arsenal, you might be wondering why you would want a corded drill to go with it. Below, we answer some of the most frequently asked questions regarding corded drills.</p> <h3>Q: What are corded drills used for? </h3> <p>With the power they offer, corded drills can handle drilling jobs that less powerful cordless drills can’t. This includes drilling holes 1/2 inch and larger in wood as well as drilling through harder materials such as metal and masonry.</p> <h3>Q: Do corded drills have a clutch?</h3> <p>If you’re familiar with cordless drills, you know they have a clutch that can be set by twisting a numbered cuff located behind the drill’s drive. The clutch allows you to adjust a drill’s power, raising it for drilling and reducing it for driving small screws that can strip easily. The higher the number, the more torque created by the drill.</p> <p>Corded drills do not have adjustable clutches. Instead, a pressure-sensitive trigger adjusts the speed.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a corded drill as a screwdriver? </h3> <p>It’s possible, but not ideal. Often corded drills are overkill for a screwdriver. Because they produce so much torque and speed, it can be difficult to keep a screwdriver bit from spinning in the screw head, which may result in stripping the bit.</p>",217
1060,right angle clamp,"<p>If you need a bit more guidance before choosing one of the best right angle clamps, read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a right angle clamp?</h3> <p>Place the clamp face-up on a flat surface, making sure there’s enough space for the two pieces you plan to join and that the clamp’s jaws are open. Slide the first piece into the clamp, lining the end up with the corner of the clamp’s arbor. Slide in the second piece until it meets with the first piece. Align the two parts until the ends are flush to each other with no overhanging edges. Hold the pieces in place with one hand while tightening the clamp with the other. Tighten by turning the handle clockwise until firm. Avoid over-tightening, which may damage the material.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clamp an irregular shape?</h3> <p>Irregularly shaped materials will not fit flush to the clamp’s flat jaws, preventing it from adequately holding the piece. To fix this problem, you need to create a brace out of scrap wood that fits between the clamp jaws and the material. The brace, which can be a single piece or multiple pieces, includes a flat side that fits flush to the jaws and an irregular side that fits flush to the piece. The brace allows the clamp to grip firmly by filling the gaps between the jaws and the irregularly shaped piece.</p> <h3>Q.How do you join two pieces of wood at right angles?</h3> <p>There are a couple of ways to do this. One method is to use a miter saw to create a miter joint. Cut each end to be joined at a 45-degree angle using a miter saw. Apply glue to the ends of the pieces. Using the right angle clamp, clamp the pieces so the mitered ends butt together, creating a mitered joint. Allow the glue to dry, then use nails or screws to reinforce the joint. If using screws, drill a pilot hole for each screw to prevent the wood from splitting.</p> <p>You can also join the two pieces using a basic butt joint. Simply place the end of one board against the side of the end of the other in the angle vice, making sure the ends are flush. As with a miter cut, use glue to join and reinforce with nails or screws once dry.</p>",400
1061,reciprocating saw,"<p>Considered a demolition saw, a reciprocating saw can be a valued addition to the tool collections of professional builders as well as DIYers who work on their own remodeling projects.</p> <h3>Q: What is a reciprocating saw used for?</h3> <p>Reciprocating saws are most often used for tear-out work, such as cutting away excess sheathing when rough-framing doors and windows or cutting through pipes and conduit.</p> <h3>Q: Are reciprocating saw blades universal?</h3> <p>Yes. Reciprocating saw blades feature a universal shank that fits most reciprocating saws.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a reciprocating saw to cut tree branches?</h3> <p>Reciprocating saws can cut through relatively small branches, up to 2 inches in diameter, but the branch should be firm, or the saw will shake it rather than cut through it.</p>",125
1062,work pants,"<p>If you’re still not sure about what kind of work pants will be right for you, consider the answers to these common questions—they’ll help you get a leg up.</p> <h3>Q. How should your work pants fit?</h3> <p>Work pants should not bind nor pinch when you perform everyday tasks. They should be comfortable but not so baggy that you run the risk of getting them caught in tools or machinery.</p> <h3>Q. What are the most common materials used for work pants?</h3> <p>Most work pants for DIYers and pros are made from canvas, cotton denim, and cotton blend fabrics. Many have a bit of spandex woven in for stretch, so the pants can move with you while resisting rips.</p> <h3>Q. What are some smart extra design features for work pants?</h3> <p>If your job requires having small supplies on hand, like screws or nails, work pants with large cargo pockets will come in handy. Likewise, if you swing a hammer, pants with a hammer loop will allow you to hang the hammer on the side of your pants when you’re not using it and free up your hands for other tasks.</p> <h3>Q. How many pockets do work pants usually have?</h3> <p>It varies. Standard work pants may have just two front and two rear pockets, while cargo-style and carpenter-style pants offer additional large pockets on the sides for carrying tools and other essentials.</p> <h3>Q. How long do work pants last?</h3> <p>You can expect to get three to six months of use out of a good pair of work pants if you’re in a job where you’re actively bending, climbing, or squatting all day long.</p>",270
1063,wood burning tool,"<p>Now that you have a bit of background on some of the wood-burning tools, you may still want more info. Check out the answers to some commonly asked questions and answers about wood-burning tools. If you still have questions, reach out to the tool’s manufacturer to chat with customer service.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a wood-burning tool?</h3> <p>Using a wood-burning tool takes some practice, but the actual process is straightforward. Plug the tool into an electrical outlet, turn it on, and adjust the temperature, letting it heat up (this can take up to 8 minutes). Then, holding the tool by the rubber grip, slowly drag the tip across the surface of the wood or other material, allowing the tip to burn in your design.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep the pen tips from getting dirty?</h3> <p>You can’t keep your tips from getting dirty, but you can clean the carbon buildup. Some kits come with sponges that you moisten and use to wipe the tip clean. You can also pass the tip over a piece of fine sandpaper to remove carbon buildup.</p> <h3>Q. Can a wood-burning tool be used on leather?</h3> <p>Wood-burning tools work great on leather. If you work on a piece of fresh vegetable-tanned leather, lower the converter to a low setting for ideal results.</p>",217
1064,jointer,"<p>Whether you’re unsure how to use a jointer or wondering how a jointer differs from a planer, read on for answers to these and other commonly asked jointer questions.</p> <h3>Q: How do you sharpen jointer blades?</h3> <p>While sending out your jointer blades to be professionally sharpened is an option, it can be costly and put your jointer out of commission for days or weeks. You also may not be happy with the results when you get them back.</p> <p>If you want to sharpen the blades yourself, you can use a simple jig that will allow you to hold the two knife cutter heads in place and sharpen the blades without even having to uninstall them. While you can purchase such a jig, you can also create one using a small block of hardwood that fits in the gap between the table and the cutter and a dowel that blocks the blade and prevents the cutter from turning. After creating or buying a blade jig for your jointer, you can sharpen the blades yourself:</p> <ul><li>Cover the outfeed table’s edges with thick tape, so they aren’t damaged during the sharpening process.</li><li>Once you’ve locked the blade in place with the jig, you’ll need to move the cutting head into the proper depth for sharpening. Place a scrap piece of wood on the cutting table, and lower the outfeed table until the blade just makes contact with the wood.</li><li>Using a 600-grit diamond sharpening stone, begin sharpening the blade by placing the stone on the blade, then draw it back in the direction of the outfeed table.</li><li>Continue until you create a small bevel across the length of the blade. Use a magnifying glass to help you examine the blade.</li><li>Switch to a 1200-grit stone and repeat the above process.</li><li>Once you’ve sharpened the blade, remove the jig, rotate to the next blade, replace the jig, and repeat the process until you have sharpened all of the blades.</li></ul> <h3>Q: How do you use a jointer?</h3> <p>Follow the directions below to properly operate a jointer:</p> <ul><li>Begin by using a shop square to make sure the joint between the outfeed table and the guide fence is exactly 90 degrees. The point of a jointer is to make a perfectly square edge. If this joint isn’t 90 degrees, that won’t be possible.</li><li>Adjust the depth dial to the desired setting.</li><li>Position the wood stock on the infeed table with the crown side up, then turn on the jointer. Make sure to cut the face first, followed by the edges.</li><li>Keeping the wood stock firmly against the fence, push the lumber through the cutter using push pads.</li><li>Next, cut the other face, followed by both edges.</li><li>If done correctly, you should end up with a perfectly square piece of lumber with four smooth sides.</li></ul> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a planer and a jointer?</h3> <p>Although a jointer and planer both remove wood from the sides of wood stock, a jointer is designed to take bowed or uneven lumber and make it straight and square. A planer removes larger amounts of wood, taking a thick board and planing it down to the desired thickness. To use a planer, one side of the board must already be flat.</p>",530
1065,bench grinder,"<p>Your grinding needs are not identical to anyone else’s, so the grinder you choose should reflect the type of materials and items you’ll be grinding.</p> <h3>Q. Should I get a 6-inch or 8-inch bench grinder?</h3> <p>If you’re a DIYer and a newbie to bench grinders, consider a 6-inch model, which should provide you with ample power to grind, sharpen, and clean a wide array of blades and tools. The larger, 8-inch grinders are designed for use by pros.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a variable speed bench grinder?</h3> <p>If you need to sharpen woodworking tools, but you also work on cars, a variable speed grinder will allow you to use the lower speed for sharpening woodworking tools and the higher speed for grinding down bolt ends or cleaning away rust from auto parts.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best grit for sharpening knives on a bench grinder?</h3> <p>A medium-fine, 60-grit wheel is optimal for getting a razor-sharp edge on your kitchen knives.</p>",160
1066,airbrush compressor,"<p>Not sure which model is the best airbrush compressor for you? Read on for tips to help you make a decision.</p> <h3>Q. Do you need a special compressor for an airbrush?</h3> <p>No, but you do need a compressor that can produce enough PSI for your specific airbrush. If the PSI is too low or too high, your airbrush won’t work correctly. Always refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for an airbrush before trying a new compressor.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best PSI for airbrushing?</h3> <p>There isn’t a specific PSI that is best for all airbrushing applications, but, generally speaking, you need a compressor capable of producing 10 to 100 PSI.</p> <h3>Q. What is used to connect the airbrush hose to the compressor?</h3> <p>You can connect the airbrush hose to the compressor directly if the hose is the appropriate size. If the hose is not the right size, an adapter is necessary. Adapters can be purchased separately, or they may be included with an airbrush compressor.</p> <h3>Q. How do you solve problems with moisture in an airbrush compressor?</h3> <p>Moisture in the form of condensation can build up inside the compressor while it is operating. That moisture can mix with the paint, resulting in thin paint and poor-quality spray. To prevent this problem, some airbrush compressors come with a built-in moisture trap. If a compressor doesn’t come with a moisture trap, you can buy one separately and install it on the compressor to stop moisture contamination.</p> <h3>Q. How do you add more volume to an airbrush compressor’s output?</h3> <p>To increase the air pressure (measured in PSI) of your compressor, you can add an additional compressor tank, clean the hose and airbrush to ensure the flow of air and paint is uninterrupted, or use a shorter airbrush hose so less pressure is lost on the way through the hose.</p>",305
1067,framing nailer,"<p>If you still have questions about which framing nailer is right for you, read on to learn more about size, angle types, and other concerns.</p> <h3>Q. What size framing nailer do I need?</h3> <p>Size is rarely an issue when it comes to framing nailers. Almost all framing nailers will fire the 3½-inch 10D nails required for framing. Instead, consider angle, weight, and type, all of which are discussed in detail above.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use 21-degree nails in a 30-degree nailer?</h3> <p>You cannot use 21-degree nails in a 30-degree nailer. The clips of nails for a 30-degree nailer versus a 21-degree nailer are very different, so they cannot work interchangeably between the two types of framing nailers.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use screws instead of nails for framing?</h3> <p>Nails are typically used for framing as they have more tensile strength than screws. Whereas nails will bend under pressure, screws are more brittle and therefore more likely to snap. That said, there are newer high-tensile screws on the market designed specifically for framing. You cannot use screws in a framing nailer. If you plan on framing with screws, you’ll need to use an impact driver or a cordless drill.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a siding nailer for framing?</h3> <p>While you can use a framing nailer for siding (by fitting it with short 2-inch screws), you cannot use a siding nailer for framing. Framing nailers require 3½-inch nails that can penetrate deep enough to create a secure connection between 2×4 boards. Siding nailers can only handle nails up to 2½ inches, so they won’t work for framing.</p>",264
1068,heated vest,"<p>Wearing a heated vest during outdoor activities can make the difference between feeling cold and miserable or being warm and comfortable. If this is your first time shopping for a heated vest, you likely have some questions.</p> <h3>Q. Are heated vests safe?</h3> <p>Yes, the lithium-ion batteries used to generate heat are low-voltage and will not result in an electrical shock. But while the outer nylon shell may be water resistant, the inner lining is not, so don’t wear a heated vest if the inside is wet. If moisture gets into the battery connections, it increases the risk of shock.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a heated vest?</h3> <p>You can wear a heated vest under a larger coat for the most heat benefit or over a thick shirt or sweater for just a bit of added warmth.</p> <h3>Q. In what temperature ranges can a heated vest be used?</h3> <p>At any temperature that you start to feel chilly, a heated vest can add some welcome warmth. For many individuals, that’s around 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. They’re also suitable for pairing with a warm overcoat if you need to stay warm and toasty in even colder temperatures.</p> <h3>Q. How long do you charge a heated vest?</h3> <p>Plan to charge the lithium-ion battery at least 3 hours before wearing your heated vest to reach full capacity. Or better yet, overnight, if possible.</p> <h3>Q. Can you machine wash a heated vest?</h3> <p>Most heated vests are machine washable, but be sure to remove the battery first. Check the apparel’s label for additional instructions about suitable water temperature and whether you can place the vest in the dryer or should hang to dry.</p>",277
1069,contour gauge,"<p>If you have more questions about contour gauges, this section may help. Below are some of the most popular questions and answers about how to use a contour gauge. Read on for more detailed instructions.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a contour gauge?</h3> <p>A contour gauge is an easy tool to use. There are four steps to follow.</p> <ul><li>First, align the pins by pushing the tool up against a flat surface.</li><li>Next, push the gauge evenly against the irregular shape to create a contour of it.</li><li>Then, if the gauge has a locking mechanism, engage the lock to hold the pins in place.</li><li>Last, transfer the gauge to the material and trace the shape. Then make your cut using a jigsaw, coping saw, or band saw.</li></ul> <h3>Q. How do you lock a contour gauge?</h3> <p>Contour gauges with a locking feature typically have a small metal lever or switch on the end of the gauge. After you have used the gauge to create a contour, lock the pins in place by moving the switch to the locked position. Now you’re ready to trace the shape onto the material you are using.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a contour gauge for multiple shapes?</h3> <p>Contour gauges can be used for many different kinds of shapes. However, you can only create the contour of one shape at a time. To create contours for longer shapes, you may need to use multiple gauges that hook together.</p>",237
1070,drill presses,"<p>While shopping for your first drill press, you likely have some questions about its range of use.</p> <h3>Q: Can you mill with a drill press?</h3> <p>Trying it is not recommended. The bit on a milling machine is designed to spin at speeds of up to 15,000 rpm or faster, which is required for shaping aluminum and other metals, while a drill press, even at top speeds, spins around 3,000 rpm.</p> <p>On a milling machine the material is clamped to a movable table, which allows the user to move the material safely. On a drill press, the table is stationary, and the machine is not equipped to mill in a way that is considered safe.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a mortising bit in a drill press?</h3> <p>Yes, mortise bits are available for use with drill presses. Mortise bits can save time when you need to cut a mortise (a hole with square sides). A mortise bit features a drill bit with a flat end and a side chisel for creating holes with straight edges.</p> <h3>Q: How do you change the speed on a drill press?</h3> <p>Drill presses come with speed adjustments that allow you to drill as fast as 3,000 rpm or as slow as around 250 rpm.</p> <h3>Q: Should you wear gloves when using a magnetic drill press?</h3> <p>You should avoid wearing gloves when using a magnetic drill press because the fabric can get caught and be pulled into the machine. However, when the magnetic drill press is not in operation and you are removing chips from the cutter and magnet, you should wear gloves to prevent cuts.</p> <h3>Q: How long does a drill press last?</h3> <p>A quality drill press should last for years, if not decades.</p>",287
1071,tile saw,"<p>While cutting tile requires some special tools, it doesn’t have to be an intimidating task. With the right knowledge, you’ll be able to cut tiles with your new saw in no time. The result will be an excellent finish for your next renovation. Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about tile saws and how they work.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need a wet saw to cut tile?</h3> <p>No, you don’t, but a wet saw could be your best option. If you don’t use a wet saw, you’ll have to deal with lots of dust. Otherwise, just ensure that you’re using a diamond-embedded blade in a grinder or handheld saw. You also can use a tile cutter for some softer materials.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a Dremel to cut tile?</h3> <p>Dremel offers several diamond-embedded cutting wheels for its rotary tools. They’ll work, but it just might take you longer, and it could be more difficult to cut a straight line. With that said, Dremel rotary tools are excellent for creating outlet cuts and curves.</p> <h3>Q: What size tile saw do I need?</h3> <p>The most common size blades are 4½ and 7 inches. Both will work for most renovation work, though 4½ -inch blades are much cheaper to replace than 7-inch models.</p>",212
1072,wire stripper,"<p>The following is a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about wire strippers. If consumers still have queries after reading through it, they may want to contact a wire stripper’s manufacturer and speak with a customer service representative.</p> <h3>Q. What is the easiest way to strip wire fast?</h3> <p>Using an automatic, self-adjusting wire stripper, such as our upgrade pick, the Knipex Tools wire strippers, is by far the best way to strip wires quickly.</p> <h3>Q. What is the easiest way to remove copper from wire?</h3> <p>The easiest way to strip copper from a wire jacket is to use a utility knife and slice the jacket down the length of the wire. Be sure to place the wire on a tabletop and keep your free hand safely behind the knife.</p> <h3>Q. Can wire strippers crimp terminal connectors onto wires?</h3> <p>Some strippers certainly can crimp terminal connectors onto wire. Some linesman-style pliers and wire strippers have built-in crimping grooves that create strong and secure connections on cable ends.</p> <h3>Q. Should a user strip wire before scrapping?</h3> <p>Scrap yards have two prices: dirty and clean. Dirty copper wire includes wire with its jacket, nuts, outlets, or anything the scrapper must remove before recycling the copper. Clean prices are higher, so it can be worth your time to strip the copper out of the jacket before turning it in.</p>",228
1073,pocket knife sharpener,"<p>Even though you’re a bit more seasoned on the types of sharpeners available and which one could work the best for your needs, you might still have some questions. Below is a list of the most commonly asked questions about knife sharpeners, how they work, and what they do. If you still have questions, be sure to reach out to your sharpener’s manufacturer and speak with a customer service representative.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take to sharpen a pocket knife?</h3> <p>It largely depends on how dull the blade is. You can put a quick edge on a blade that’s already in decent shape in 30 seconds. Other knives might need more work, but rarely will it take more than 10 to 15 minutes once you set your tools up.</p> <h3>Q. Can you ruin a knife by sharpening it?</h3> <p>Absolutely. You can remove too much material and completely reshape the blade to the point that it doesn’t work as well. This is especially important to watch for when sharpening vintage or classic knives.</p> <h3>Q. Should I sharpen a new knife?</h3> <p>Many new knives are sharp, but not as sharp as they could be. They often come out of the package with a bent wire edge on the grind. A honing rod could help create a sharper edge without actually grinding any material away.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you sharpen a pocket knife?</h3> <p>When the blade stops cutting well, you should sharpen it. It depends on how often you use your knife, the blade’s material, and the angle of the grind. A dull knife can be very dangerous to use, as it can become hard to control while still being sharp enough to cut your skin, so make sure to keep your knife nicely honed.</p> <h3>Q. What angle do you use to sharpen a knife?</h3> <p>The best do-all angle for a pocket knife is about 17 degrees. This angle creates a reasonably sharp and durable edge.</p> <h3>Q. Does a sharpening steel wear out?</h3> <p>While it’s rare that you could completely wear out a sharpening steel, the diamonds can start to lose their effectiveness after many, many sharpenings.</p>",356
1074,dovetail jig,"<p>Now that you know a bit more about the products that are available for helping cut dovetails, other questions may arise. Here, find a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about dovetail jigs and their answers. If you still have questions, a manufacturer’s customer representative customer service department may help.</p> <h3>Q: Do you need much experience to use a dovetail jig?</h3> <p>No, experience isn’t necessary, but it’s important to realize that small mistakes can end up in ruined joints. Taking time, aligning the workpieces, and ensuring that everything is stable on the workbench — all help achieve excellent results.</p> <h3>Q: What is a lapped dovetail joint?</h3> <p>Lapped dovetail joints are popular in cabinetmaking. These joints look like standard dovetails; however, the dovetails don’t extend all the way through one of the pieces. This makes the dovetails hidden from one side of the joint.</p> <h3>Q: What is a full-blind dovetail?</h3> <p>The dovetails in a full-blind joint are just like standard dovetails, but they don’t pass all the way through. They aren’t visible from any side of the joint. The dovetails hide inside the joint and provide a strong joint with lots of glue surface.</p> <h3>Q: Are any dovetail joints weaker than the rest?</h3> <p>Comparing strength in dovetail joints comes down to several different variables, including the size of the dovetails and even the strength of the wood. However, comparing dovetails to box joints and other lap-style joinery almost always shows that dovetails are the strongest when compared to fingerjoints and box joints.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of joints can you make with a dovetail jig?</h3> <p>The possibilities are endless, but a dovetail jig can create dovetail, hidden dovetail, through dovetail, sliding dovetail, mitered dovetail, and box joints, just to name a few.</p>",293
1075,ratcheting wrench set,"<p>Now that you have a more thorough understanding of how ratcheting wrenches work, the benefits they offer, and the multitude of available options and features, you may have some questions. We’ve posed some of the most frequently asked questions and included their corresponding answers below.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a ratcheting wrench and a socket?</h3> <p>There are several differences between a ratcheting wrench and a socket. First, a ratcheting wrench is much more slender, so it can fit into tight spaces where sockets can’t go. Second, on a socket, the drive is in the handle, which is separate and can come apart while you work. On a ratcheting wrench, the drive is contained within the tool. Third, you can pass a ratcheting wrench over a threaded bar to a nut, but that is not physically possible with a socket.</p> <h3>Q. Does a ratcheting wrench work in a tight space?</h3> <p>Absolutely. One of the big advantages of a ratcheting wrench is that it can fit in the same small gap as an ordinary wrench while providing a more secure hold on the nut or bolt.</p> <h3>Q. What is the significance of tooth count on a ratcheting wrench?</h3> <p>The tooth count on a ratcheting wrench dictates how far you have to move the wrench to engage the drive and, thus, apply pressure to the fastener. More teeth mean the tool has to swing through a smaller arc. For example, a 36-tooth ratchet needs to move 10 degrees to engage while a 72-tooth ratchet only has to move 5 degrees.</p>",259
1076,telescoping ladder,"<p>Compared to their heavier-duty cousins—cumbersome extension ladders—telescoping ladders are the new kids on the block. If this is the first time you’ve shopped for one, you likely have some questions.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best ladder brand?</h3> <p>Gorilla Ladders, Werner, and Little Giant are among the most trustworthy brands and produce some of the safest telescoping ladder options.</p> <h3>Q. How do you know what size telescoping ladder you will need?</h3> <p>A 12-foot telescoping ladder is the best size for around-the-house DIY repairs and projects. Taller ladders are designed with pros in mind.</p> <h3>Q. Which is better, a fiberglass or an aluminum telescoping ladder?</h3> <p>Aluminum is the lightest option and least likely to corrode. But this metal is among the most effective conductors of electricity. That means you shouldn’t use metal ladders for electrical work or near electrical lines. Fiberglass ladders, while heavier than aluminum, are stronger and more versatile. The material is nonconductive, so you can use a fiberglass ladder for both electrical and nonelectrical applications.</p> <h3>Q. What is the tallest telescoping ladder available?</h3> <p>The tallest telescoping ladder is about 26 feet high, but that height is typically only necessary for construction professionals and is limited to multiposition options.</p>",199
1077,guide best step ladder,"<p>Step ladders are handy indoors and out, but first-time shoppers might still have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a Type 1 and Type 2 ladder?</h3> <p>The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) rates ladders by the maximum amount of weight they can hold. Type 1 ladders can support 250 pounds; Type 2 ladders can safely support up to 225 pounds.</p> <h3>Q: What is the safest step ladder?</h3> <p>The safest step ladders provide a sturdy working platform, support plenty of weight, and include additional features such as side rails to assist with ascending and descending. The charaHOME 4 Step Ladder was chosen as the Best for Safety pick because of these attributes, plus it offers wide steps at every level.</p> <h3>Q: What is the highest rung I can go up on a step ladder?</h3> <p>The highest rung a user should ascend on a conventional A-frame step ladder is two rungs down from the top. The average maximum safe reach is about 4 feet above the top of the ladder.</p> <h3>Q: Which is better, an aluminum step ladder or a fiberglass step ladder?</h3> <p>Aluminum ladders are strong, lightweight, and weather resistant. They are relatively inexpensive, resist corrosion, and are easy to set up. Fiberglass is even more durable than aluminum. It tends to be much stronger and more weather resistant. Unlike aluminum, fiberglass is nonconductive, making it the superior choice for electrical projects.</p> <h3>Q: What angle should a ladder be when in use?</h3> <p>For safety purposes, a straight or extension ladder should slope at a 75-degree angle when in use. This rule doesn’t apply to step ladders because they do not lean against a wall.</p> <h3>Q: How do I keep a ladder from slipping?</h3> <p>Step ladders are less prone to slipping than other ladders thanks to their pyramidal shape, but they can still tip if placed on uneven ground. Before ascending a step ladder, make sure it’s stable (not wobbly) and that it’s on solid ground. Do not climb above the third rung from the top, and always face the ladder when climbing up or down.</p>",347
1078,wood router,"<p>Armed with all this knowledge about the best wood routers and the models available, you may be ready to shop for yourself or gift it to your favorite woodworker. However, some people still may have a few questions about how routers work and how to choose the best one. A collection of the most frequently asked questions about wood routers follows.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between a plunge router and a wood router?</h3> <p>A plunge router is a wood router, so no real difference exists. However, there is a difference between a fixed-base router and a plunge router: The plunge router has a spring-loaded base that allows you to safely lower the bit down into the center of a board. This is significantly more difficult with a fixed-base router, though this kind of router makes it easier to set and cut edge profiles.</p> <h3>Q: What type of wood router do I need?</h3> <p>A fixed-base router works for most projects. If creating intricate joinery, however, look for a plunge-base router.</p> <h3>Q: What size wood router is recommended?</h3> <p>It depends on the project. Light-duty routing with a ¼-inch collet router is absolutely fine, while heavy-duty work requires a ½-inch collet.</p> <h3>Q: Do torque and rpm affect routing?</h3> <p>Torque matters much less than rpms. Your router needs speed (rpms) to work effectively, and adjustable (and maintainable) speed matters more than start-up power (torque). In fact, routers with too much torque can be downright dangerous, so manufacturers are less likely to use motors with too much torque.</p>",253
1079,adjustable wrench,"<p>Hopefully you have a better idea of how to choose the best adjustable wrench for your repair needs. If you still have some questions, this section is for you. Below is a collection of the most frequently asked questions related to adjustable wrenches. Take a look below to see if there’s an answer to your question.</p> <h3>Q. Is a crescent wrench the same as an adjustable wrench? </h3> <p>Crescent is a brand, and they make plenty of wrenches, both adjustable and nonadjustable. The name is somewhat synonymous with adjustable wrenches because the company has been making quality models for years.</p> <h3>Q. Should you push or pull a wrench?</h3> <p>If it’s possible, you should pull a wrench toward you. You’re less likely to slip and smack your knuckles on the workpiece.</p> <h3>Q. How long do adjustable wrenches last?</h3> <p>A quality adjustable wrench that is properly used and maintained can last a lifetime. Spraying the adjustment screw with a lubricant a few times a year will help to maintain the longevity.</p>",168
1080,laser measure,"<p>Before deciding on a new laser distance measure, you may have a few lingering questions. The following answers to some frequently asked questions may help you make a more informed decision about which model is right for you.</p> <h3>Q: How does a laser measure work?</h3> <p>A laser measure essentially emits light in a concentrated beam, then measures the time it takes for the light to hit an object and reflect back to the laser measure. Through this process, it is able to determine the distance between the laser measure and the object it’s pointed toward.</p> <h3>Q: Can a laser measure replace a tape measure?</h3> <p>A traditional tape measure is a better option for short measurements because it takes less time to set up, but there are hybrid laser measures that incorporate a traditional tape measure into the laser measure, providing users with both tools.</p> <h3>Q: How accurate is a laser distance measurer?</h3> <p>An average laser distance measurer is capable of accurately measuring a distance to within 1/8-inch or even 1/16-inch at a distance of 50 feet.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a laser distance measurer outside?</h3> <p>Yes, a laser distance measurer can be used outside, but bright sunlight can impair the ability to see the laser dot. Moreover, other factors can interfere with the reading, such as falling leaves or blowing dust and debris. Consider using a telescopic optical viewfinder, a tripod, or a targeting camera for better results outdoors.</p> <h3>Q: How do you calibrate a laser distance measurer?</h3> <p>To calibrate a laser distance measurer, refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Each model may have a different calibration method, such as a detailed manual process or an automatic process. Some laser measures may require professional calibration.</p>",284
1081,pex crimp tool,"<p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about PEX crimp tools and their corresponding answers. Take a look through this section for any additional information not covered above.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best PEX to use?</h3> <p>PEX B is considered the best all-around PEX pipe. It leaches far fewer chemicals and has a higher bursting pressure. The disadvantage is that it can be harder to work with.</p> <h3>Q. Do PEX clamps fail?</h3> <p>They can fail, but it’s usually due to human error. If the clamp is applied crookedly or unevenly, it will leak.</p> <h3>Q. Can I crimp PEX with pliers?</h3> <p>You cannot get a solid, accurate, leak-free joint with pliers, which can’t apply even pressure all around the crimp.</p> <h3>Q. Can I run PEX through floor joists?</h3> <p>PEX can run through floor joists, stud walls, or almost anywhere else that would normally hold plumbing (according to local code).</p> <h3>Q. Can I run PEX to a water heater?</h3> <p>PEX should not run directly to a water heater, but it can run to a copper riser 18 inches or more in length, coming directly from the water heater.</p> <h3>Q. What is the lifespan of a PEX pipe?</h3> <p>PEX may be able to last more than 100 years. While it hasn’t been around long enough to verify that longevity, long-term testing indicates it could last a century before breaking down.</p>",229
1082,digital tape measure,"<p>If making an informed decision on this handy tool feels like information overload, you’re not alone. Let’s answer some of the most frequently asked questions about the best digital tape measures. Be sure to check for an answer to your question listed below.</p> <h3>Q: How does a digital tape measure work?</h3> <p>Using a digital tape measure is very similar to using a standard tape measure, except with a beam of light instead of metal tape. Once you have the laser in the right location for measuring, turn on the button and a display will illuminate the measurement of length, volume, and/or the indirect measurement of a room.</p> <h3>Q: How accurate is a digital tape measure?</h3> <p>Standard digital tape measures will be accurate within 1/8 to 1/16 of an inch.</p> <h3>Q: How much does a digital tape measure cost?</h3> <p>The average digital tape measure will cost anywhere between $25 to $40, while higher-end models could cost up to $300.</p> <h3>Q: Where can I buy a digital tape measure?</h3> <p>Digital tape measures can be purchased at most home improvement stores including Lowe’s, The Home Depot, and Walmart, or on some online retailers such as Amazon.</p>",193
1083,tile cutter,"<p>Do you still have some questions about cutting floor or wall tile with your new tile cutter? This next section will help. It’s a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about tile cutters. Be sure to check this section to see if there’s an answer to your question here.</p> <h3>Q. How do I use a tile cutter?</h3> <p>To cut a tile, lower the cutting wheel onto the surface of the tile. Push the wheel into the surface of the tile and roll it across the surface. At the other end, lift the handle so the snapping foot drops onto the tile surface. Press down until the tile snaps.</p> <h3>Q. What type of tile is easiest to cut?</h3> <p>Porcelain and ceramic tiles are the easiest to cut. They’re fairly brittle, so scoring and snapping usually yield a clean result.</p> <h3>Q. How can I tell if my tile is ceramic or porcelain?</h3> <p>Porcelain tile has a consistent color on both the front and back of the tile. Ceramic tile typically has just a glazing, which means the front and back will potentially be different colors.</p> <h3>Q. Why doesn’t my tile cutter cut straight?</h3> <p>It might have a bent scoring wheel, or it could be the result of applying uneven pressure. If it’s an electric tile cutter, check if the blade is warped or slow down while pushing the material through.</p> <h3>Q. Why is my tile cutter breaking tiles?</h3> <p>The scoring wheel may be dull, or it may need more pressure. Change the blade and adjust the cutting technique to avoid breakage.</p>",262
1084,spotlight,"<p>Spotlights have come a long way since the development of LED bulbs that emit powerful beams of light. If you’re shopping for a good spotlight, you likely have some questions.</p> <h3>Q. What spotlight shines the farthest?</h3> <p>That depends on the spotlight’s lumens and the power of its battery and its barrel design. In this roundup, the Feidake Xenon Spotlight takes top honors for the farthest light beam, up to 1.5 miles.</p> <h3>Q. How many lumens makes for a good spotlight?</h3> <p>For illuminating an average-size backyard, a spotlight with as little as 500 lumens is more than sufficient. To see at a distance when hunting or camping, opt for more lumens, at least 2,000.</p> <h3>Q. How bright is 1,000 lumens?</h3> <p>A single lumen is as bright as one candle at a distance of 1 foot, so 1,000 lumens is equal in brightness to 1,000 candles at the same distance. However, be aware that spotlights use reflectors to concentrate lumens and direct them in a powerful beam that will seem more intense than the light’s corresponding candle comparison.</p>",176
1085,forstner bit set,"<p>While the first section of this article provides a comprehensive understanding of Forstner bit construction and use, and Our Top Picks section offers a selection of some of the best Forstner bit sets currently available, you may have some lingering questions. Here are the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about Forstner bits.</p> <h3>Q: What are Forstner bits used for?</h3> <p>Forstner bits create clean, accurate holes—particularly those with a flat bottom, rather than one that goes all the way through the material. One common use is when fitting the type of hinge used for kitchen cabinet doors. They can also drill overlapping holes without deflecting, which allows for fast material removal when cutting mortises. Woodturners use them for boring out vases, making candle holders, etc.</p> <h3>Q: Is a Forstner bit better than a spade bit?</h3> <p>It depends on the kind of hole you want. Spade bits work faster, but the hole is often ragged. They’re often for construction, where pipework needs to go through softwood lumber for example. A Forstner bit is slower but leaves a clean finish. It can make flat-bottomed holes, which a spade bit cannot.</p> <h3>Q: Can Forstner bits be used with a hand drill, hammer drill, or impact driver?</h3> <p>Forstner bits can be used with a hand drill, hammer drill, and an impact driver, with provisos. Using a Forstner bit in a hammer drill won’t make as clean a hole and is likely to create considerable debris. An impact driver could be used, but it’s not an ideal tool for drilling—it might also need a chuck adapter. Some Forstner bits have a hex shank that could fit the impact driver chuck if the sizes are the same, but many are round.</p> <h3>Q: Can Forstner bits be used on metal, stone, or tile?</h3> <p>Strictly speaking, both HSS and carbide bits are capable of drilling aluminum, copper, or brass. However, they will wear much more quickly and cannot drill through steel. Carbide bits can cut stone or tile, though a diamond hole saw might be better. It’s a good idea to check though. Many manufacturers say their Forstner bits should only be used for wood and wood-based composites.</p> <h3>Q: How deep can you drill with a Forstner bit?</h3> <p>It depends on the length of the Forstner bit shaft. The only limit is the drill chuck coming into contact with the workpiece. If you need to bore deep holes, extension bars can be purchased, though it’s important to check size to make sure they are compatible. Up to eight inches may be possible.</p>",427
1086,screwdriver bit set,"<p>Do you still have some lingering inquiries about the best screwdriver bit sets? Take a look at some of the most frequently asked questions to help you choose the best drill bits for your project.</p> <h3>Q: How do you choose a screwdriver bit? </h3> <p>Choosing a screwdriver bit should depend entirely on its intended use. Consider the screw head type, the desired circumference and depth, and the material being used before selecting a drill bit set.</p> <h3>Q: Are screwdriver bits universal?</h3> <p>Most screwdriver bits are ¼-inch in size, and cordless drill heads adjust to accommodate drill bits in a variety of sizes.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a screwdriver bit in a drill?</h3> <p>Most screwdriver bits on the market are designed to withstand the pressure of use in a power drill, but always consult a product’s packaging and manufacturer’s recommendations before proceeding.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

1087,splitting maul,"<p>If you’re still wondering what size maul is right for you or how a maul differs from an axe, then read on for answers to these and other common questions about mauls.</p> <h3>Q. Which is better: a splitting maul or a splitting axe?</h3> <p>It depends on the size and quantity of wood you’re cutting. A splitting maul is better for cutting large chunks of wood due to its heavier weight, which provides more power than an axe. For smaller pieces of wood, an axe works better, as it is lighter and more comfortable to swing.</p> <h3>Q. How often should I sharpen a splitting maul?</h3> <p>It’s a good idea to file the edge before each wood-splitting session to prevent the blade from getting dull. The maul may require more sharpening if it hits the ground repeatedly.</p> <h3>Q. What weight is the best for a splitting maul?</h3> <p>The best weight for a splitting maul is 8 pounds. This weight provides a sufficient amount of power for splitting logs while remaining light enough for most people to manage. Mauls generally span between 4 and 12 pounds. A 4-pound maul is too small to split larger pieces of wood, while a 12-pound maul, though powerful, is often too heavy for most people to wield.</p>",210
1088,manual tile cutter,"<p>If you haven’t decided on a particular tile cutter because you still have some questions, this section may help. Some of the most frequently asked questions and answers about tile cutters are just ahead.</p> <h3>Q. What materials can be cut with a manual tile cutter?</h3> <p>Tile cutters can cut floor, wall, and backsplash tiles. They work best on glass tiles, as well as ceramic and porcelain, though you may be able to use them on some stone tiles like marble.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep tile from chipping when cutting?</h3> <p>Chipping is a concern for powered wet tile saws; it isn’t a concern for manual tile cutters. However, there are three things you can do to ensure a clean snap when cutting tile manually.</p> <ol><li>Ensure your wheel is sharp and free from chips.</li><li>Make just one pass when you score the tile, using even pressure.</li><li>Don’t allow the tile to move once you score it. This will help to ensure the score is directly over the snapping ridge for a clean cut.</li></ol> <h3>Q. How do you change the blade on a manual tile cutter?</h3> <p>In most cases, a screw and a bit of friction are all that hold the cutting wheel or blade in place on a tile cutter. Simply back out the screw and grab the edge of the old wheel with a pair of pliers to remove it. Place the new wheel in the slot, and replace the screw.</p>",239
1089,hole saw kit,"<p>If you’re still wondering about how hole saws work, then read on for answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about these tools.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a hole saw without a pilot bit?</h3> <p>You do not have to use a pilot bit with a hole saw; however, it is challenging to center a hole saw without using a pilot bit as a guide.</p> <h3>Q: Will a hole saw cut through stainless steel?</h3> <p>A good bimetal hole saw will cut through hard materials, such as thin-gauge steel and stainless steel.</p> <h3>Q: Can a hole saw cut metal? </h3> <p>A hole saw will cut through thin-gauge metal materials like aluminum and steel. When possible, use oil or water to lubricate the surface to prevent the bit from overheating, which can damage the bit.</p> <h2>Why Trust Bob Vila</h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

1090,dust masks,"<p>If you still have some questions about dust masks, here is a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about the best dust masks. Be sure to check here to see if there’s an answer to your question listed below.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a dust mask and a respirator?</h3> <p>Respirators have to pass tests and meet certain criteria in order to receive NIOSH approval. Dust masks do not. Respirators are as effective as dust masks, but dust masks are not as effective as respirators.</p> <h3>Q. Are dust masks good for smoke?</h3> <p>Some dust masks may help filter light smoke, but only N95 or P100 respirators are proven to be truly effective.</p> <h3>Q. Do dust masks protect against viruses? </h3> <p>Dust masks are not proven to protect against viruses. They don’t filter out particles small enough to fight viruses.</p> <h3>Q. Are dust masks reusable?</h3> <p>Some are. Most paper masks are not reusable, while fabric masks can be washed and used over and over again.</p>",167
1091,welder,"<p>The tips and picks in this guide likely have increased your knowledge of how various welders function. It should also have provided valuable insight into choosing the best welder for the tasks you need to perform. That said, you might still have some questions. The following section addresses those that crop up most often.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between welding, brazing, and soldering?</h3> <p>Welding uses high temperatures to actually melt the metal of the pieces to be joined, creating the strongest possible bond. Brazing uses lower temperatures and a soft metal—typically bronze or brass—as a molten filler, almost like a glue. It is often used on materials like titanium, which are challenging to weld. Soldering uses low-melting-point alloys, normally as a permanent attachment for electrical connections.</p> <h3>Q: What type of welder do I need?</h3> <p>MIG welding is the easiest to learn and will accomplish a wide variety of tasks; it’s where most people start. TIG welding provides more precision and control, and stick is best for outdoors. A few multiprocess welders offer all three.</p> <h3>Q: What size welder should I buy?</h3> <p>As discussed above, type of task and duty cycle will be the main considerations in determining power requirements. Be careful not to underestimate. Operators can turn down a more powerful welder, but an underpowered model will result in inferior welds.</p> <h3>Q: Can I plug a welder into a regular outlet?</h3> <p>Welders designed for hobby and light industrial welding can run on regular household outlets. High-voltage welders (220 to 240 volts) will need an upgraded breaker and perhaps larger diameter cable. If in doubt, consult a qualified electrical contractor.</p> <h3>Q: Is it legal to weld at home?</h3> <p>Absolutely, as long as what you’re working on is for your own use. Don’t forget general workshop safety. If you start to charge for your welding, it might still be possible to work from home, but you’ll need to check zoning regulations.</p> <h3>Q: What other equipment will I need for welding?</h3> <p>A welding helmet is vital to protect the eyes and face. Never weld without one. Safety glasses are great for many workshop tasks but aren’t sufficient for welding. You’ll also want a welding apron and proper welding gloves.</p>",366
1092,saw blade for cutting laminate flooring,"<p>Working with laminate flooring can be a challenge, but with the right saw blade, a little skill, and a lot of knowledge, it can be a rewarding process that looks great when the project is complete. Read the most commonly asked questions and their answers below to learn more about choosing and using the best saw blade for cutting laminate flooring.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a special blade to cut laminate?</h3> <p>Laminates are infused with aluminum oxide chips that can wear down blades that aren’t designed to cut through this material. Look for thin kerf blades that have between 80 and 100 carbide-tipped teeth, or consider using one with just a few diamond teeth that make quick work of hard materials like fiber cement and the wear layer of laminates.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a reciprocating saw to cut laminate flooring?</h3> <p>Yes, a reciprocating saw technically can cut through laminate flooring, but the results will likely be rough at best. This is because a reciprocating saw needs to bite into the material to create a clean cut, and laminate is a smooth surface that tends to just get scratched up by reciprocating saw blades. It’s better to use a miter saw, circular saw, or a jigsaw for laminate.</p> <h3>Q. Will a Dremel tool cut laminate flooring?</h3> <p>A Dremel tool or another brand of rotary tool with the appropriate cutting wheel can cut through laminates, plywood, hardwood, and a variety of other materials. These are best for making small cuts.</p> <h3>Q. How can I cut laminate without chipping it?</h3> <p>To avoid chipping laminate, use a blade with a thin kerf and a high number of carbide-tipped teeth. You also can lay masking tape or painter’s tape along the cutline to help minimize chipping.</p>",292
1093,drywall stilts,"<p>Consider these frequently asked questions about drywall stilts if you aren’t certain about what product would be suitable for your next drywall project or if you are concerned about the safety of drywall stilts.</p> <h3>Q. Are drywall stilts dangerous?</h3> <p>Drywall stilts attempt to make work faster and easier by providing a very mobile alternative to a ladder or scaffold. However, stilts place the user in danger of falling and should be used with a high degree of precaution to prevent slipping, tripping, and falling. They can also cause head injuries if the user isn’t paying attention and hits their head on a ceiling, light, doorframe, or any other obstruction.</p> <h3>Q. Are drywall stilts hard to use?</h3> <p>Drywall stilts can look intimidating at first, but the wide rubber base and leg supports help ensure that it only takes a few projects before the average user can become proficient with stilts. However, if you will only need them once or twice, it may be better to use a ladder because they do take some time to learn how to use.</p> <h3>Q. How tall should stilts be?</h3> <p>Within a height range of 15 inches to over 5 feet (60 inches), stilts should be high enough to allow the user to comfortably reach the area where they will be working without stretching or becoming off-balance.</p> <h3>Q. Are stilts OSHA approved?</h3> <p>Drywall stilts are OSHA approved in most places. However, before choosing a set, it’s a good idea to look up local OSHA regulations to be certain that they are permitted where you live.</p> <h3>Q. How do you adjust drywall stilts?</h3> <p>Drywall stilts can be adjusted by removing a bolt in the extension tubes and raising or lowering the tube until it is aligned with a new hole. Then just replace and secure the bolt in the new position, and the stilts will then stand at a different height.</p>",314
1094,concrete saw,"<p>Before investing in a new concrete saw, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers to learn more about what size saw is most appropriate for your next project and how to use and maintain a concrete saw.</p> <h3>Q. How deep will a 14-inch concrete saw cut?</h3> <p>A 14-inch concrete saw can cut to a depth of 4 5/8 inches, though some 14-inch masonry saw blades can cut 5 inches deep.</p> <h3>Q. How deep will a 12-inch concrete saw cut?</h3> <p>A 12-inch concrete saw will cut about 3 5/8 inches deep.</p> <h3>Q. How do you cut thick concrete?</h3> <p>In order to cut thick concrete, it’s a good idea to make several shallow passes with the concrete saw. After each pass, increase the blade depth by 1/2 inch. This helps to reduce the strain on the motor and keep the blade cool.</p> <h3>Q. Do you push or pull a concrete saw?</h3> <p>Allow the concrete saw to do most of the work by guiding the forward momentum of the blade. The user shouldn’t pull a concrete saw, nor should an individual push very hard.</p> <h3>Q. How do you care for and maintain a concrete saw?</h3> <p>Care for and maintain a concrete saw in the same way you do any other saw. Keep it clean and inspect it before and after every use. Ensure the nuts and screws are tight and that the cutting blade fits correctly with no signs of damage. Regularly inspect the power system, whether it is gas, battery, or corded for signs of wear. To be certain the saw is working correctly, have it professionally inspected once per year.</p> <h2><b data-stringify-type=""bold"">Why Trust Bob Vila</b></h2> <p>Bob Vila has been America’s Handyman since 1979.

1095,splitting wedge,"<p>Still have lingering questions about splitting wedges? Read on to discover answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about splitting wedges.</p> <h3>Q. Can a splitting wedge become blunt?</h3> <p>A splitting wedge can become blunt after repeated use. Sharpen the wedge with a hand file or a grinding wheel if it becomes dull.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain my splitting wedge?</h3> <p>A splitting wedge doesn’t have any moving parts, so it requires very little maintenance. Be sure to properly store a wedge to protect it from moisture, which can cause rust or corrosion.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a splitting wedge last?</h3> <p>A splitting wedge’s functional lifespan mostly depends on the material with which it’s constructed and the type and size of wood it’s being used for. A wedge made from hardened high-carbon steel may last a lifetime, while a wedge constructed with softer steel might only last a single season if it’s used to split large rounds or hardwoods.</p>",160
1096,fencing pliers,"<p>By now you probably have an excellent understanding of the way the best fencing pliers perform, and you might well have chosen the pair you want. However, even the most comprehensive guide to fencing pliers might still leave a few questions unanswered. The following are those that crop up most often.</p> <h3>Q. What do fencing pliers look like?</h3> <p>The head has a hammer surface on one side and a curved claw on the other. For increased leverage, the two handles are usually longer than those on standard pliers. Areas for gripping and cutting wire are in the center of the head.</p> <h3>Q. Should the handles of fencing pliers have a cushion grip?</h3> <p>It’s a good idea to have some form of cushioning on the handles to improve grip and comfort.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use fencing pliers?</h3> <p>Fencing pliers are multipurpose. You can use them like standard pliers to grip wire or to cut through it. When holding the handles, you can use the head to hammer staples into posts, or you can reverse it and use the claw to lever them out.</p>",183
1097,straight edge clamp,"<p>If you’re still wondering about how a straight edge clamp works, here are the answers to some of the most common questions about these tools.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a straight edge clamp?</h3> <p>A straight edge clamp works with a circular saw, router, jigsaw, or other power saw to create a straight edge. Attach the clamp to the work material by pulling the fixed end of the clamp against the piece, and then sliding the movable end against the piece’s opposite edge. Then use the locking handle to tighten the clamp into place. Press the saw’s fence against the straight edge of the clamp while cutting to create a straight line.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use straight edge clamps to cut boards without parallel ends?</h3> <p>Straight edge clamps that have attachments for miter cuts allow the clamp to attach to a board with ends that aren’t parallel in addition to allowing the user to make miter cuts.</p> <h3>Q. How do extensions affect the quality of the cut?</h3> <p>While extensions are handy and can allow for cuts 100 inches long or more, keep in mind that a longer edge clamp is more likely to bend during a cut. The joint between the extension and main piece presents a weak area that can bend. Longer edge clamps should be wider to prevent this bend from happening.</p>",224
1098,aluminum floor jack,"<p>Even with an extensive primer on the best aluminum floor jacks, there might be some additional questions popping up. The following aims to address them. It’s a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about aluminum floor jacks, so be sure to check for an answer to your question below.</p> <h3>Q. Where do you put a floor jack under a car? </h3> <p>All vehicles are different, so the best way to determine where to put a floor jack is by referring to your owner’s manual. It will point out the exact points that the manufacturer recommends for jacking the vehicle for safety purposes.</p> <h3>Q. How do you jack up a car with a floor jack?</h3> <ol><li>Place the saddle under the vehicle’s jacking point.</li><li>Pump the handle to lift the saddle to the jacking point.</li><li>Position the jack so it will not be in your way while working.</li><li>Pump the handle until the vehicle reaches a sufficient height.</li><li>Place a jack stand underneath the vehicle to keep it from falling accidentally.</li></ol> <p>After you jack up the vehicle, be sure to lift the jack’s handle so it is in the upright position; this will prevent you or someone else from tripping over the jack and causing an accident.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my aluminum floor jack last? </h3> <p>It’s not uncommon for floor jacks of all sorts to last more than 10 years. Ensuring that it’s clean and spraying the joints and wheels with a bit of lubricant, like WD-40, after each use will help.</p>",249
1099,cordless framing nailer,"<p>Even with this extensive background on the best cordless framing nailers, you might have some additional questions. The following section aims to help. It’s a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about cordless framing nailers, so be sure to check for your question below.</p> <h3>Q. For what purposes could I use a cordless framing nailer?</h3> <p>A cordless framing nailer is used for framing walls, floors, decks, ceilings, and roofs, as well as covering those surfaces with sheathing. They have too much power for many other applications.</p> <h3>Q. What is the most common framing nailer? </h3> <p>The most common framing nailers are the 21-degree models, with the Paslode cordless framing nailer being one of the most popular cordless models.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a 21- and 28-degree framing nailer?</h3> <p>When it comes to framing nailers, the difference between any two degree types is the angle of the tip where the nail comes out and the magazine. A 21-degree framing nailer uses plastic-collated nails with fully round heads, while a 28-degree framing nailer (which isn’t available as a cordless model) uses wire-collated nails with clipped or offset heads.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use 21-degree nails in a 30-degree nailer?</h3> <p>No, and doing so is likely to cause damage. It’s important to use the correct fastener for a framing nailer to work properly.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a framing nailer for siding?</h3> <p>You can, but it’s not a good idea. Even with the nail depth adjustment backed all the way off, it’s likely that a framing nailer will nail siding too tightly to the surface underneath or shoot the nail through the siding material altogether.</p>",275
1100,cordless brad nailer,"<p>This guide should help you find the best cordless brad nailer for your needs. However, a few general questions may crop up. Keep reading to find frequently asked questions along with their answers.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between a brad nailer and a finish nailer? </h3> <p>Brad nailers are a slightly smaller tool than a finish nailer, and they use 18-gauge brads, which are slimmer and have a smaller head than nails. Brads are better for fixing lightweight trim that a finish nailer might split. Finish nailers, which fire 15- or 16-gauge nails, are better for baseboards and other jobs that need a stronger hold.</p> <h3>Q: How do you load a brad nailer?</h3> <p>The magazine contains slots to hold different-length brads. The user simply slides a strip of brads into the relevant slot so the front end of the brad falls nearest the nose. A spring clamp slides up from the bottom of the magazine, holding the brads in place and advancing them each time the user fires the nailer.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a brad nailer? </h3> <p>Rest the nailer’s nose against the workpiece and pull the trigger. Find tips for safe and effective nailer use in this handy guide.</p> <h3>Q: How long should brad nails be?</h3> <p>Many experts say that brad nails should be three times longer than the thickness of the material being fixed. So for a ½-inch board you would need a 1½-inch brad. However, sometimes this causes the brad to protrude through the material, which you will probably want to avoid. In that case, use the longest brad that can be accommodated.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a brad nailer for baseboards? </h3> <p>You can use a brad nailer for baseboards, though a finish nailer is the professional’s choice. It has more power and provides a stronger fix.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain my cordless brad nailer? </h3> <p>Dirt can cause jams in cordless nail guns, so experts recommend a quick cleaning of the tool after each use. The mechanism should be lubricated periodically according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>",340
1101,sander for furniture,"<p>Revitalize your furniture by sanding old and faded paint, or smooth out rough spots on a piece of custom furniture, with the best sander for furniture. But if you are still unsure about which sander is suitable for your next project or whether an orbital sander is better than a palm sander, continue reading to find answers to these questions and more.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of sander should I use for furniture?</h3> <p>It depends on the type of furniture, but generally, a palm sander or detail sander is the best option for refinishing furniture because their smaller shape accommodates both small and large projects. Rotary, random orbital, or belt sanders also suitable for medium and large woodworking projects.</p> <h3>Q: Is an orbital sander better than a palm sander?</h3> <p>Orbital sanders and palm sanders are suitable for different projects. Orbital sanders are large, heavy-duty tools that are best for taking on big projects, like a bed frame, headboard, and footboard, whereas palm sanders are significantly smaller and would take too long to be useful for large projects.</p> <p>Use a palm sander for small woodworking projects, like a coffee table or mailbox. They also make a better choice for working with softwood because the force of the palm sander is easier to control, preventing the tool from eating through too much wood.</p> <h3>Q: Why does my sander leave swirl marks?</h3> <p>Users need to ensure that there is nothing between the sandpaper and the wood, like a stray piece of grit or a large pile of dust. This obstruction prevents the sander from evenly sanding down the wood. Swirl marks also can appear if the user moves the sander very quickly over the surface of the material. This creates drag that produces an uneven finish.</p> <h3>Q: How do I sand inside without making a mess?</h3> <p>Avoid making a mess by covering the area with a drop cloth for protection and using a dust-collection bag on the sander. If the sander is not compatible with a dust-collection bag, you might need a partner to use a small vacuum to suck up the dust as you produce it.</p> <h3>Q: How do I know what sandpaper to use?</h3> <p>Sandpaper is organized by grit. Products that have lower numbers like 40- to 50-grit indicate coarse sandpaper, while high numbers begin at about 120-grit and exceed 220-grit. These higher numbers signify fine or extra-fine sandpaper.</p> <p>Coarse sandpaper can remove a lot of material at a fast pace but can leave some roughness behind. Fine sandpaper can’t remove a lot of material, but the finish is soft and smooth. Choose the sandpaper that best suits your purposes.</p> <h3>Q: Why won’t my sandpaper stick to my sander?</h3> <p>If sandpaper won’t stick to the sander, the reason is likely that the sander pad needs to be cleaned or replaced. Sander pads can get dirty during use and might just need to be cleaned off, but if the pad is damaged or worn out, it will need to be replaced.</p>",498
1102,dowel jig,"<p>This guide provides an overview of many of the factors to consider when choosing the best dowel jig for your workshop tasks. However, you may still have some questions about using dowels. The answers to some of the most frequently asked queries follow.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a dowel size?</h3> <p>When creating edge and corner joints, ideally, the dowel should be one-third the thickness of the board you’re joining. While up to half the thickness of the board is permissible, don’t go any further. For large overlapping joints, size is rarely important.</p> <h3>Q: How far apart should dowels be placed?</h3> <p>It depends on the job. On end-grain material, dowels can be as close as practical to provide maximum support. On 1- to 2-foot boards, place a dowel approximately 1 inch from each end and 4 to 6 inches apart in between. On long boards, position dowels up to 10 inches apart.</p> <h3>Q: Do dowels need glue?</h3> <p>Yes. Dowel joints are intended to be permanent, so apply a small amount of glue. If you think you will want to disassemble your project at some point, consider using a pocket hole jig, which uses removable screws rather than dowels.</p> <h3>Q: How much weight can a dowel hold?</h3> <p>While many variables impact the amount, some experts in the field note that a 1-inch dowel can hold 3,000 to 4,000 pounds.</p> <h3>Q: Why are dowels often used in making an edge joint?</h3> <p>Dowels make it easy to align surfaces and prevent them from slipping while the glue dries, which can dramatically reduce the need for corrective work later.</p>",265
1103,sawzall blades,"<p>While this guide provides an overview of the technical aspects of reciprocating saw blades and lists some excellent choices, it’s a surprisingly complex subject. As a result, many different questions may arise when trying to choose the best reciprocating saw blades. Keep reading to find the answers to some of the questions that crop up regularly.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a reciprocating saw blade?</h3> <p>As discussed, the key issues are blade material, TPI, and blade size. The correct reciprocating saw blade is the one that offers the best combination of these elements for the workpiece. Manufacturers’ guidance is usually accurate, but remember it may be better to have several different types of reciprocating saw blade than try to use one not designed for the job.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen reciprocating saw blades?</h3> <p>In most cases, use the same technique as when sharpening a handsaw blade. However, with high TPI blades, in particular, the task is fiddly and time-consuming. Carbide and diamond blades cannot be sharpened.</p> <h3>Q. How do you change reciprocating saw blades?</h3> <p>One way to change a reciprocating saw blade is to use an Allen screw to remove the blade, slot in a new one, and retighten the screw. For a blade with a sprung collar, simply slide the collar open with your thumb to change the blade.</p> <h3>Q. How do you store reciprocating saw blades?</h3> <p>Storing blades in the packaging they came in helps protect the cutting edge. Or, use a plastic box or simply wrap them in thick cardboard and tape.</p> <h3>Q. How long do reciprocating saw blades last?</h3> <p>So much depends on the quality of the blade and the work it’s used on that it’s difficult to determine, but a blade can last from a few hours to several weeks. Most users keep a spare blade handy.</p>",303
1104,orbital polisher,"<p>Even with all that background on choosing the best orbital polisher, some new questions might pop up. The following section aims to buff those questions out so the answers are crystal clear, as it’s a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about orbital polishers.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a dual action polisher and a random orbital polisher?</h3> <p>Dual-action and random orbital polishers are one and the same. They vary from single-orbit or rotary polishers in that the pad of the buffing path is oval, whereas single-orbit polishers feature tight and consistent orbits.</p> <h3>Q. Can a random orbital polisher be used to sand a surface?</h3> <p>Yes, in fact, many brands market their polishers as sander/polisher combos.</p> <h3>Q. When should a polishing compound be used?</h3> <p>When using a polishing compound, it should be used after using a rubbing compound or a wax cleaner.</p> <h3>Q. Why choose a random orbital polisher over a high-speed polisher?</h3> <p>Random orbital polishers are more user-friendly, and they’re less likely to leave swirl marks behind.</p>",172
1105,drill bits for tile,"<p>The sections above explored how the best drill bits for tile are constructed and offer top examples of those currently available. In researching this article, a number of questions cropped up regularly. In the event you still have unanswered questions about selecting the best drill bits for tile, keep reading.</p> <h3>Q. How do you drill through tiles without cracking them?</h3> <p>Using the right drill bit is key. Standard drill bits will not cut through the surface, which leads to too much pressure being applied, cracking the tile. Use masking tape to mark the position of the hole. This will also provide initial grip for the bit. Hold the drill firmly and apply slow, steady pressure. If you also need to drill the masonry or concrete behind the tile, do not use the hammer action until you are through the tile.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to drill through porcelain tile?</h3> <p>Diamond-tipped drill bits are recommended for porcelain. The bit can get hot, so dipping it in water occasionally, or spraying the area while working, will keep it cool and help it cut more effectively.</p> <h3>Q. How do you drill a hole in ceramic tile?</h3> <p>The technique is described in the question above about how to drill tiles without cracking them. A carbide-tipped drill bit is usually recommended, although a diamond-tipped one will also do a good job.</p> <h3>Q. Can I drill in between tiles?</h3> <p>You can, but the grout is a relatively soft surface and the drill bit can easily wander. If you need accuracy, drilling through tile is usually preferred.</p> <h3>Q. How can I differentiate a ceramic tile from a porcelain tile?</h3> <p>Porcelain has a finer texture, but it can be difficult to tell the difference if the tiles are already on a wall. Ceramic tile usually has a glazed top layer that is a different color to the core, which may show at the edge. Porcelain is usually the same color throughout.</p> <h3>Q. What safety equipment do I need when using drill bits for tile?</h3> <p>Whatever you are drilling, you should wear suitable eye protection. If you typically wear glasses, wear goggles over them. A lightweight dust mask is also a good idea.</p>",366
1106,rotary laser levels,"<p>The article above has a great deal of valuable information aimed at helping you find the best rotary laser level for your needs and should have answered many questions. However, during our research we came across a number of queries that cropped up quite frequently, so we have gathered those here along with relevant answers.</p> <h3>Q. How accurate is a rotary laser level?</h3> <p>It varies from one model to the next. The least accurate might be ±¼ inch over 50 feet. The best rotary laser levels are ±⅛ inch over 100ft.</p> <h3>Q. Is a green or red laser beam better?</h3> <p>Most people find green lasers easier to see, particularly outdoors. However, special red-tinted glasses largely compensate for the difference, and these are often included with red rotary laser levels.</p> <h3>Q. Should I get a tripod when using a rotary laser level?</h3> <p>Tripods certainly help maintain accuracy. Trying to find somewhere stable to rest your rotary laser level can be difficult, and a tripod can provide a solid platform regardless of how irregular a surface is.</p> <h3>Q. Are all rotary laser levels waterproof? </h3> <p>No. Some have no waterproofing at all, and others might be described as splash proof or shower proof. To ensure the rotary laser level is waterproof, it should have an IP (ingress protection) rating, such as IP67, for example. The first number gives its protection against dust, and the second against water.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between red and green rotary laser levels?</h3> <p>Although it can vary from one manufacturer to the next, red rotary laser levels are cheaper and typically use less energy, so the batteries last longer. Because of the extra cost, green rotary laser levels are not common.</p>",284
1107,plate compactors,"<p>The sections above provide a wealth of information to help you choose the best plate compactor for a particular project or range of tasks. While many technical questions will have been answered, during our research we found several of a general nature that merit consideration.</p> <h3>Q:What’s a plate compactor used for?</h3> <p>It can be used to compress sub-bases before pavers or stone walkways are laid, and again afterward to ensure the surface is level. A plate compactor can smooth asphalt on driveways, parking lots, and similar surfaces and also compact soil during general landscaping work.</p> <h3>Q. How strong do you need to be to handle a plate compactor?</h3> <p>In use, it is more a question of technique than physical strength. Many people say the sensation is as if the machine floats over the surface. However, all of the plate compactors we looked at weigh at least 100 pounds, so even with wheels they do require some effort to move around.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need any safety gear to operate a plate compactor?</h3> <p>Plate compactors are loud, so ear protection is recommended, as are safety glasses. Gloves and strong work boots are a good idea. In commercial environments, steel-toed boots and a hard hat are often required.</p> <h3>Q:Should I wet gravel before compacting?</h3> <p>You don’t need to, but if it’s very dry a little water can be sprayed over to help keep the dust down. There is no point in soaking it.</p> <h3>Q:How much will pavers sink when compacted?</h3> <p>This depends on the preparation. The usual recommendation is to compact the sub-base, then lay 1 inch of concrete sand as a bed for the pavers, which helps them interlock properly. In this scenario, pavers will then normally sink about 3/8 of an inch when compacted.</p> <h3>Q:Can you use a plate compactor on soil?</h3> <p>Absolutely. They are particularly effective on so-called granular soils that contain small stones, gravel, or sand.</p> <h3>Q:How do you compact a sub-base without a compactor?</h3> <p>You could use a lawn roller or a hand tamper, though it will be very difficult to achieve the same level of compaction you would with a good plate compactor.</p> <h3>Q:What size plate compactor do I need for pavers?</h3> <p>The size of the plate compactor isn’t as important as the force applied. The Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute (ICPI) recommends that the best plate compactor for pavers should not exceed 5,000 pounds of force, as anything more could damage them. Experts also recommend fixing a mat to the bottom of the plate to protect the paver surface.</p>",423

The second and third digits refer to the cubic centimeters of the engine. Chainsaws meant for professionals include an XP at the end of the model number.</p> <h3>Q. How do you tell what year a Husqvarna chainsaw is?</h3> <p>The year of the Husqvarna chainsaw is delineated by the first two characters of the serial number. For example, a series number that starts with 99 is a 1999 model.</p> <h3>Q. How do you read a Husqvarna chainsaw bar?</h3> <p>A chainsaw bar will have a series of numbers printed on it that include a decimal, a fraction, and a number followed by “DL.” The decimal refers to the gauge size of the chain. The fraction refers to the pitch size, while the number before “DL” lists the number of drive links.</p> <h3>Q. What size of Husqvarna chainsaw do I need?</h3> <p>If you’re a casual chainsaw user who needs a chainsaw for light trimming and small branches, then a 14-inch chainsaw should be adequate. For medium-duty work that includes felling small trees, look for chainsaws in the 16- to 20-inch range. For cutting down larger trees or thicker branches, select a chainsaw that’s 22 inches or longer.</p> <h3>Q. How do you start an old Husqvarna chainsaw?</h3> <p>While starting an old chainsaw can sometimes be a struggle, there are a few things you can do to make it easier. Make sure you’re using fresh fuel and that the chainsaw has the right amount of oil in it. Also, check the spark plug to make sure it’s in good working condition and properly seated.</p>",310
1109,pickaxes,"<p>If you’re wondering how a pickaxe differs from a mattock or how you might use your new pickaxe, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions about these outdoor tools.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a pickaxe and a mattock?</h3> <p>Although the terms are often used interchangeably, the pickaxe and mattock are different tools. A mattock is a hand tool that has a vertical axe blade combined with a horizontal blade called an adze. A pickaxe, in comparison, has an adze blade side and a pointed pick side.</p> <h3>Q. What are some common uses for a pickaxe?</h3> <p>A pickaxe is commonly used in farming and landscaping to break up hard or rocky soil or to dig a hole for new plantings. Pickaxes that have an adze end are also useful for removing weeds.</p> <h3>Q. How should I clean my pickaxe?</h3> <p>Clean your pickaxe by brushing off any dirt or debris that may be clinging to it after use. If the pickaxe is wet, dry it off before putting it away.</p> <h3>Q. Can a pickaxe be used to do interior work, such as tearing out drywall?</h3> <p>While it is possible to use a pickaxe for interior demolition work, it’s not really designed for this purpose. A pickaxe is more likely to cause more collateral damage, which could include plumbing and electrical. A sledgehammer is better suited for this type of work.</p> <h3>Q. Is one type of wood better than another for the pickaxe handle?</h3> <p>Ash and hickory are the best wood species for a pickaxe handle. These hardwoods are very strong and also have a small amount of flex that allows them to absorb impacts.</p>",279

1115,jointer planer combos,"<p>The information above consists of a comprehensive guide to the technical aspects of the best jointer planer combos and provides real-world examples. While many questions associated with these machines will be answered above, questions of a more general nature also crop up frequently. To help make the search for the best tool easier, we have responded to popular general questions below.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a jointer and a planer?</h3> <p>A jointer is used to flatten the face of a piece of wood and plane an edge to 90 degrees. It can also cut bevels (chamfers), angling an edge at 45 degrees, for example. A planer is used to make both sides of the stock parallel and to plane it down to the required thickness. Hence, it is why they are often called thickness planers.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a jointer as a planer?</h3> <p>A jointer can plane rough stock to make it flat, and the stock could then be turned over and the other face planed. However, if there is any twist or taper in the board, planing both sides separately may not remove the twist. This is the job that a planer does well. Those who want to work with rough lumber need both machines or a jointer planer combo.</p> <h3>Q. Can a table saw be used as a jointer?</h3> <p>A table saw can be used to square an edge (and cut a variety of joints) but only if the board is already flat. It cannot be used to true up the face.</p> <h3>Q. Is a jointer planer combo worth it?</h3> <p>Whether a jointer planer combo is worth it will depend on the type of woodworking you do and the space you have available. The article above discusses the pros and cons and offers solutions for a variety of different sizes and price points to meet the needs of most woodworkers.</p>",314

Do smart plugs slow down Wi-Fi?</h3> <p>Smart plugs alone don’t tend to have a large bandwidth requirement and are unlikely to slow down Wi-Fi speeds. However, if the smart plug is part of a large smart home system with several devices, it is possible for these systems to affect Wi-Fi speeds.</p> <h3>Q. How many devices can I plug into my outdoor smart plug?</h3> <p>It depends on the number of outlets included in the outdoor smart plug. Most outdoor smart plugs have one to four outlets.</p>",208
1117,portable air compressor,"<p>If a portable air compressor seems like it might be a big help for certain projects, but you still want more info, consider the answers to commonly asked questions below. For additional questions or concerns, reach out to the air compressor’s customer service number.</p> <h3>Q. How does a portable air compressor work?</h3> <p>Portable air compressors use a motor to operate a piston. The piston draws outside air into a chamber and then stuffs it into a tank. It continues doing so until the pressure builds up enough to operate tools and inflate tires.</p> <h3>Q. How do you set up a portable air compressor?</h3> <p>Most portable air compressors come set up out of the box. If one doesn’t, the most setup that could be necessary is to install a quick-connect on your hose port.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a portable air compressor?</h3> <p>For electric compressors, simply plug it into an electrical outlet and flip the power switch on. Once the compressor builds up pressure, users can adjust the outlet psi with a built-in pressure regulator to match the tool’s requirements.</p> <p>For gasoline-powered compressors, fill the fuel tank and check that the engine has oil in it. Flip the power switch to the on position and pull the pull-start cord until it starts.</p> <h3>Q. Why do portable air compressors come in various shapes?</h3> <p>The different shapes of compressors aren’t really a functional design concern, so manufacturers can get creative with their designs. Sometimes separating the tank into two smaller tanks allows the compressor to have a lower center of gravity to aid in portability.</p> <p>Other times, the designs simply take up less space. For example, a horizontal compressor can fit under a workbench, while a vertical compressor fits better in a corner.</p> <h3>Q. How much air pressure do you need in a portable air compressor?</h3> <p>This really depends on the task. Bike tires and sports balls don’t require much pressure at all. On the other hand, pneumatic tools usually require 90 psi or more to operate effectively. If inflating something, look for the maximum pressure written on the item near the inflation valve.</p>",352
1118,quiet air compressors,"<p>After reading up on the recommended shopping considerations and checking out our reviews of some of the best quiet air compressors, a few questions may linger. Ahead we have answered some of the most common questions shoppers ask about quiet air compressors.</p> <h3>Q. Which air compressor is the quietest?</h3> <p>Most quiet air compressors available to consumers are high-efficiency dual-piston pump types. They are engineered to exacting tolerances and operate at lower rpms to pressurize more air with less movement, which makes them quieter overall. Typically 60 dB is considered among the quietest, and there are several options including the California Air Tools 8010 Air Compressor.</p> <h3>Q. How do I make my air compressor quieter?</h3> <p>Most of the noise associated with air compressors is associated with the intake. For those who want to know how to make an air compressor quiet, simply install an air compressor intake silencer.</p> <h3>Q. How many dB is a quiet air compressor?</h3> <p>Overall air compressor dB ratings range from as low as 40 dB for some small, specialized types to more than 90 dB. Quiet air compressors operate in the 70- to 80-dB range, while ultra-quiet air compressors operate at 60 dB.</p> <h3>Q. What is an air compressor muffler?</h3> <p>An air compressor muffler, or silencer, is a noise filter that can be installed on the air intake to reduce noise.</p> <h3>Q. Is there a quiet 20-gallon air compressor?</h3> <p>Yes. Our “Best for Home Garage” pick, the 20-gallon California Air Tools Ultra Quiet Air Compressor operates at 70 dB.</p> <h3>Q. What tank capacity do I need for air tools?</h3> <p>Don’t be confused by tank size. Some tools work with less than 2.5 cfm, but others need as much as 5.5 cfm to function properly, regardless of tank size. Air tools are powered by airflow (cfm) at 90 psi, so start by looking for and comparing that spec.</p> <p>Air tools that utilize quick bursts of air, like nailers, function just fine on smaller tanks, especially if the tank holds higher pressure (higher air pressure equals more air). After ensuring adequate cfm airflow for your tools, a larger tank simply provides more runtime before recovery. All that being said, a good starting point for low-demand air tools would be 2 gallons. For high-demand tools, 8 to 10 gallons would be better.</p> <h3>Q. How can I make my air compressor quieter?</h3> <p>Install a muffler, or silencer, to quiet a loud air compressor.</p>",402

That valuable information is underlined by examples of some of the top cordless drills currently available. Nevertheless, with so many options available, a few questions might remain. The following are answers to some of the most common questions.</p> <h3>Q: What can a cordless drill be used for?</h3> <p>The primary use of a cordless drill is for drilling holes and driving screws. However, you can also get numerous attachments. There are stirrers for mixing paint and other liquids. You can also attach a sanding drum, a wire brush for rust removal, or a polishing bonnet. We have produced a handy guide to cordless drill uses here.</p> <h3>Q: Are cordless drills less powerful?</h3> <p>Corded models were once more powerful tools. But today, equally powerful cordless models rival them. However, cordless models lose some of their power over the course of the charge while corded models perform at a consistent level for as long as they’re plugged in.</p> <h3>Q: What’s the difference between a cordless drill and an electric screwdriver?</h3> <p>An electric screwdriver is usually much smaller, has limited power, and cannot drill holes. The cordless drill can make holes and also drive screws.</p> <h3>Q: Which brand of cordless drill is the best?</h3> <p>New and improved models enter the market all the time, so it’s difficult to say which brand is best overall. Brands with a reputation for high quality tools include Bosch, DeWalt, Makita, and Milwaukee. However, almost all modern cordless drills are pretty durable and reliable.</p> <h3>Q: How long do cordless drills last on a single charge?</h3> <p>It very much depends on the amp hours of the battery and how hard the drill is working. A battery can last as little as 15 minutes, though many will run between 30 minutes and an hour. Buying a spare battery allows you to simply swap one out and carry on working while the other charges.</p>",335
1123,robot vacuum,"<p>If you have questions about how to select or use a new robot vacuum, the following are answers to some of the most common ones.</p> <h3>Q. Can a robot vacuum replace a normal vacuum?</h3> <p>While many modern robot vacuums work well for light day-to-day cleaning, they still don’t quite compare to standard upright vacuums in terms of how much dust and debris they’re able to pick up.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need a mapping robot vacuum?</h3> <p>The mapping function helps conserve battery power, which makes this feature convenient for larger homes. Mapping vacuums use their charge time more efficiently by avoiding cleaning the same areas more than once.</p> <h3>Q.

1124,snow blower,"<p>That’s a lot of information about the best snow blowers, and it might feel like your wheels are spinning on ice when trying to make a decision. The following section aims to answer the most frequently asked questions, so be sure to look for an answer to your question below.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a snow blower and a snow thrower?</h3> <p>The terms “snow blower” and “snow thrower” are used interchangeably, but there are a couple of technical differences. While both clear away snow, a snow thrower is a single-stage machine, and a snow blower can be a single-stage, two-stage, or three-stage machine. Snow blowers clear a wider swath and are better suited for heavier snows, while snow throwers work well on light snow.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a snow blower?</h3> <p>For the best results, use a snow blower just after the snow has stopped falling when it’s still light and fluffy. Make uniform passes down and back on the sidewalk or driveway, adjusting the discharge chute as necessary to toss the snow off of the surface.</p> <h3>Q. How do you start a snow blower?</h3> <p>You may have to pull a manual recoil cord to start a gas snow blower, although many start by push button these days. Cordless and electric models start at the push of a button.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a snow blower carburetor?</h3> <p>A dirty carburetor can keep a gas-powered snow blower from starting or cause it to emit dirty, smoky exhaust. A carburetor cleaner will dissolve the gunk and debris so your machine will run more smoothly. To clean the carburetor, you’ll need to remove its cover, which may come off differently depending on the make and model. Consult your owner’s manual to find out how to reach the carburetor.</p> <h3>Q. How do you store a snow blower?</h3> <p>The best spot to store a snow blower is either in a garage or storage shed during the summer when it’s not in use. If you don’t have the extra space, you can store it outside under a waterproof tarp.</p>",347

This section will try to nail them down, as it’s a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about hammers. Be sure to check for an answer to any of your most prying questions listed below.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best brand of hammer?</h3> <p>Carpenters and tradespeople can be oddly specific about their hammers, but Estwing is one of the most well-regarded and used hammer brands. The Rockford, Illinois, company has been manufacturing hand tools for almost 100 years.</p> <h3>Q: What hammer weight is the best?</h3> <p>In general, the best all-around hammer weight is 16 ounces. It can do a bit of framing as well as a bit of light work. However, for light-duty work, hammers as light as 10 or 12 ounces will do the trick. Heavy-duty framing hammers weigh 22 to 24 ounces, and framing hatchets weigh nearly 30 ounces.</p> <h3>Q: Are heavier hammers better?</h3> <p>Heavier hammers are not necessarily better. A 16-ounce hammer in the hands of someone who knows how to wield it is far better than a 20-ounce hammer swung by someone without the same degree of skill.</p>",207
1126,wet dry vacuums,"<p>Investing in a wet/dry vacuum simplifies cleanup for a variety of messes, but before buying, consider the vacuum’s intended use, where it will be stored, and whether it should be portable. For those thinking about buying a wet/dry vacuum for the first time, a few questions are to be expected. Here are answers to some of the most common questions.</p> <h3>Q. Is a shop vac the same as a wet/dry vac?</h3> <p>The terms are often used interchangeably, but some shop vacs might not feature wet-suction capabilities.</p> <h3>Q. Is a shop vac more powerful than a regular vacuum?</h3> <p>That depends on both the quality of the regular vacuum and the quality of the shop vac. In general, however, a shop vac is more powerful than a household vacuum.</p> <h3>Q. Can I vacuum water with a shop vac?</h3> <p>Many shop vacs (not all) also are wet/dry vacuums, and users can suck up water as well as dry messes.</p> <h3>Q. Can a wet/dry vac clean carpets?</h3> <p>A shop-type wet/dry vacuum is often the tool of choice for sucking water out of a flooded carpet. It is not, however, a carpet cleaner.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a wet/dry vac?</h3> <p>Figure out what type of messes you need to vacuum. Then, select a wet/dry vac with the power and capacity to easily tackle those messes.</p> <h3>Q.

1127,work gloves,"<p>Work gloves have been around for decades, but they have become more popular as glove design and construction has improved to incorporate better stitching, different materials, and cold-weather protection like that found in insulated or heated gloves. With so many options, there may be some lingering questions. Find answers below to some of the most commonly asked questions about work gloves when selecting a new pair.</p> <h3>Q. Which type of work gloves last the longest?</h3> <p>For their durable, thick constructions and ample safety features, leather work gloves are considered to last the longest out of all types of work gloves available.</p> <h3>Q. Which gloves do mechanics use?</h3> <p>The most common types of gloves that mechanics use are nitrile and some kinds of leather. These options are durable and flexible, and they offer abrasion and vibration resistance while also providing enough dexterity to hold small tools and parts.</p> <h3>Q. What is the toughest material for work gloves?</h3> <p>For completing heavy-duty tasks, two of the toughest materials are nitrile latex and leather. These two materials are hard enough to resist abrasions, cuts, and punctures while also keeping out harmful materials and liquids.</p>",190
1128,sawhorse,"<p>Sawhorses are often a lot more complex than just somewhere to rest a piece of lumber for cutting, sanding, or drilling. We hope the comprehensive explanation of available features has answered many of your questions. If not, below we respond to the most common queries.</p> <h3>Q: How tall should sawhorses be?</h3> <p>A height between 26 inches and 32 inches suits most average people, but those taller than 6 feet might want something taller.</p> <h3>Q: What angle should sawhorse legs sit at?</h3> <p>Anywhere between 15 and 25 degrees from the vertical provides a good, stable angle. The wider the angle, the more space the sawhorse takes up, but the more stability it provides.</p> <h3>Q: Should you always use two sawhorses?</h3> <p>With basic sawhorses, yes. Two sawhorses give better workpiece support, which helps keep material stable and level. It makes working more comfortable and often frees up both hands. Heavy-duty models with a clamp to hold the workpiece may work on their own, though for large sheet material two are still better than one.</p> <h3>Q: What can I use instead of a sawhorse?</h3> <p>Any kind of stable surface may work: a pair of solid boxes, strong wooden chairs, or tables. It’s important both for safety and working accuracy that they don’t move around or flex. However, it really is best to use sawhorses whenever possible. If budget is an issue, it is relatively easy to make your own.</p>",236
1129,random orbital sander,"<p>Power sanders make quick work of smoothing rough trim, decks, railings, and virtually any other type of wood project, and random orbital sanders figure among the most popular types of sanders due to their ability to smooth wood without leaving telltale cross-grain marks. Those who are expanding their power-tool collection to include random orbital sanders will likely have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q. How do random orbital sanders work?</h3> <p>Random orbital sanders employ two different types of motions: spinning and oscillating (moving in an elliptical fashion). The combination of these two sanding movements keeps the sander from leaving marks on the wood.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between orbital and random orbital sanders?</h3> <p>Orbital sanders simply spin. Random orbital sanders spin in addition to the entire sanding head moving in an elliptical pattern. Try holding a random orbital sander and then turning it on—your entire hand will want to move in an elliptical pattern. That’s due to the orbital force of the sander.</p> <h3>Q. What are random orbital sanders used for?</h3> <p>Random orbital sanders are used for primary sanding steps, such as removing coarseness or roughness from the wood surface. They are often followed up by sanding either with a finish sander or by hand with a fine-grit sandpaper.</p> <h3>Q. Are random orbital sanders finishing sanders?</h3> <p>No, but using a random orbital sander will help remove most of the roughness. A finishing sander can be used afterward to create a very smooth surface.</p>",241
1130,hammer drill,"<p>Even after selecting a new hammer drill for your workshop, you may have additional questions. Take a look below to find the answers to several commonly asked questions about the capabilities of a hammer drill, the difference between a hammer drill and a regular drill, the average life of a hammer drill, and more.</p> <h3>Q. What is a hammer drill best used for?</h3> <p>Hammer drills are primarily designed for light masonry work. The added hammer function allows them to impact harder materials, like mortar and brick, while the rotational force drives a neat drill hole through the material.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a regular drill and a hammer drill?</h3> <p>The main difference between a regular drill and a hammer drill is that a regular drill can only rotate the drill bit. A hammer drill, as the name indicates, has a hammering motion that impacts the target material with the tip of the drill bit. At the same time, the drill bit is rotating, allowing the combination of forces to drive through tough mortar, brick, and concrete.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a hammer drill bit with a regular drill?</h3> <p>A hammer drill bit or a masonry bit can be used in a regular drill, though you may have difficulty drilling large-diameter holes through concrete and other tough material with a regular drill.</p> <h3>Q. Can a hammer drill go through rebar?</h3> <p>With the right drill bit, you can use a hammer drill to drill through rebar, though it may take some time. If you are regularly dealing with rebar, it may be better to consider using a rotary hammer drill.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a hammer drill last?</h3> <p>A hammer drill will typically last about 5 to 10 years, depending on the frequency of use and the level of care taken during routine maintenance.</p>",304

Although it will have answered the majority of questions that occur to potential buyers, some users might have more general-use questions. Some of the most popular questions have been answered below.</p> <h3>Q. What do I need to use a table saw?</h3> <p>Apart from protective goggles or safety glasses and a stand of some sort, everything you need should come with the saw. In addition to providing some basic tips for using the table saw above, there is a more in-depth beginner’s guide here.</p> <h3>Q. Can a 10-inch table saw cut a 4×4?</h3> <p>A few 10-inch table saws will cut a 4×4 in a single pass, but not many. Bear in mind that 4×4 refers to dimensioned lumber that is actually closer to 3½ inches square. A common maximum for 10-inch table saws is 3⅛ inches, though the cut can usually be completed by turning the material over and running it through the saw again.</p> <h3>Q. Can I put a table saw on a miter saw stand?</h3> <p>It might be possible, but it is not recommended. Miter saw bases are fixed differently, so the result would probably be unsafe.</p> <h3>Q. What can I use for a table saw stand?</h3> <p>A sturdy bench can work, and it isn’t difficult to find plans for DIY table saw stands. You could also consider investing in a purpose-built stand.</p> <h3>Q. Where should you stand when using a table saw?</h3> <p>You should usually stand behind the saw table and to the left of the blade. Make sure you are comfortable and not stretching. If working with large sheet material, it’s a good idea to have someone support it on the out-feed side.</p>",307
1132,jigsaw,"<p>Even with ample background on the best jigsaws, some additional questions might be popping up. This section, a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about jigsaws, aims to answer those queries, so check for the info you need below.</p> <h3>Q. What is a jigsaw best used for?</h3> <p>Jigsaws excel at making circular or rounded cuts for decorative woodwork and crafts. However, they’re also handy for making square cuts where a circular saw might not work, such as toe-kicks for cabinets and stringers for stairs.</p> <h3>Q. Can you cut straight with a jigsaw?</h3> <p>You can, but straight cuts are not as easy as they are with a circular saw. The skinny blade is more likely to curve, but clamping a straightedge to the workpiece will help allow the user to cut straight.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a jigsaw and a reciprocating saw?</h3> <p>Both jigsaws and reciprocating saws have reciprocating motions, but they are different types of saws. Jigsaws use small, thin blades with short strokes, while reciprocating saws have larger, thicker blades with longer strokes. Reciprocating saws are heavier duty, so they’re often used for demolition, cutting pipes, and other tough materials.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a jigsaw?</h3> <p>Choosing a jigsaw comes down to a few factors:</p> <ul><li>Compatibility with your existing battery system</li><li>Built-in features like LED lights, dust blowers, and orbital cutting</li><li>Budgetary constraints</li></ul>",228
1133,angle grinder,"<p>Even with ample background on the best angle grinders, you might have some additional questions. Here, we answer some of the most common queries about angle grinders, so check for the info you need below.</p> <h3>Q: What kind of tasks can I use an angle grinder for?</h3> <p>The most common uses for angle grinders are metal grinding and cutting, such as steel for welding or metal piping. However, they’re also useful for wood carving, refinishing, and other projects. Some farriers even use them to trim hooves.</p> <h3>Q: How does an angle grinder operate?</h3> <p>After attaching the correct disc for the job, hold the angle grinder in two hands for safety and security (the tool’s initial torque will cause it to jump). Push the trigger down or hit the power switch, and the disc will start rotating. Move the grinder until the rotating disc contacts the material you want to cut or grind.</p> <p>When finished, release the trigger or switch off the power button and wait for the disc to stop rotating completely before placing it in a safe location, keeping in mind that the disc is still hot due to the friction caused during operation. Unplug the power cord or detach the battery and allow the tool to cool down.</p> <h3>Q: How much does an angle grinder cost?</h3> <p>An angle grinder can range in price from just $30 to over $200, though it’s more common for these tools to cost about $80 to $100.</p> <h3>Q: How do you cut metal with an angle grinder?</h3> <p>Use a metal cutting disc on an angle grinder to cut through lead, iron, copper, and other metals without a problem. The rotating blade slices easily through metal, but it’s important to wear safety glasses and gloves because a significant amount of sparks are produced during the grinding process.</p> <h3>Q: How do you cut pavers with an angle grinder?</h3> <p>Angle grinder equipped with masonry discs can be used to cut through paving stones without much difficulty. Measure and mark where you want to cut the paver, then position it on a workbench. Turn the grinder on and start to slowly cut into the paving stone. Once you have started the cut it will be easier to accurately finish cutting through the paver.</p> <h3>Q: How are the discs on an angle grinder changed?</h3> <p>First, unplug the grinder or remove the battery. Then remove the nut that holds the disc in place, using the factory spanner included with the angle grinder. Replace the disc and tighten the nut bolt using the factory spanner.</p> <h3>Q: How can I remove the disc with vise grips?</h3> <p>Grinder discs are secured with a specialized nut that is usually tightened or removed with an included spanner. However, if you lose the spanner the nut can still be removed with a set of vise grips. Simply tighten the vice on the grinder blade, locking it in position, then use your hand or a screwdriver to turn and remove the locking nut.</p> <h3>Q: How do you properly recycle an old angle grinder?</h3> <p>Instead of tossing your old angle grinder in the trash, take it to a local electronics recycling location. Typically, the municipality or town will have a program for recycling electronic tools and other devices, though some home improvement stores, like Home Depot, also offer tool recycling programs.</p>",554
1134,heat gun,"<p>Learn more about using a corded or portable heat gun by taking a look at some of the most commonly asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q: Is a heat gun hotter than a hair dryer? </h3> <p>Even a mini heat gun can reach significantly higher temperatures than a hair dryer. Typically, a hair dryer will have a maximum temperature of about 140 degrees Fahrenheit, while many electric, gas, and cordless heat guns have a minimum temperature of around 120 degrees.</p> <h3>Q: Can you weld plastic with a heat gun? </h3> <p>Plastic can be welded with a heat gun. These tools are commonly used to weld high-density polyethylene and polypropylene plastic, because these plastics are difficult to effectively glue.</p> <h3>Q: How long can you leave a heat gun on?</h3> <p>The exact length of time a heat gun should be left on varies depending on the product. However, it isn’t recommended to use a heat gun for longer than 15 to 20 minutes continuously before allowing the heat gun to cool.</p>",165
1135,glues for plastic,"<p>For best results, it’s wise to fully understand how to properly use glues designed for bonding plastic. Find answers to some of the most common questions about these adhesives below:</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between plastic glue and Super Glue?</h3> <p>Plastic glue is a broader category of glues that Super Glue (cyanoacrylate) belongs to because of its ability to bond with some plastics. Epoxies, model cement, and multi-purpose glue (polyvinyl acetate) could also be considered plastic glue.</p> <h3>Q: Does Gorilla Glue work on plastic?</h3> <p>According to the manufacturer, Gorilla Glue can work well with many types of plastics, but it’s not recommended for use with polypropylene or polyethylene plastics, or with rubber that has a high oil or plasticizer content. The company does make specific products for these materials, however.</p> <h3>Q: What should I do if I get plastic glue on my hands?</h3> <p>If you get plastic glue on your hands, soak them in warm water and massage the skin to try to remove the glue. If this fails, apply acetone (nail polish remover) to remove the glue, making sure to wash well after use and apply lotion, as acetone is drying to skin.</p>",195
1136,router bits,"<p>If you still aren’t entirely confident about which kind of router bits you need, take a look at these popular questions and their answers below.</p> <h3>Q: How do I use router bits?</h3> <p>To use a router bit, you need to properly attach it to a router and work on the material and project that the bit is intended for to ensure the best results. Using a router requires precision and patience to adequately align the router and slowly feed it through the material, allowing the rotating router bit to operate at its optimal power.</p> <p>Forcing the router through the material may get the cut done faster, but you risk snapping the router bit off due to excessive force, and you are likely to char the material and give it an uneven edge that will need to be sanded or smoothed. Instead, use shallow, slow passes to get the best cut, working your way deeper into the material with each pass.</p> <h3>Q: How can I clean router bits?</h3> <p>Router bits can quickly become coated in resin when working with woods, like pine, that is naturally very resinous. You are also likely to get tar, dust, and other miscellaneous debris baked-on to the bits, interfering with the router’s operation and the finish on the wood.</p> <p>Regular cleaning of the bits takes care of this issue. Begin by picking up a router bit and resin cleaner online or from your local hardware store. The solution should be properly prepared according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and then sprayed or brushed liberally all over the cutting edges of the router bits. Let the bit stand for 10 to 15 minutes with this coating, then proceed to scrub the bit clean with a toothbrush or brass wire brush under a stream of warm water. After washing, dry the bits properly and consider using oil to coat the bits and protect against corrosion.</p> <h3>Q: How do I sharpen router bits?</h3> <p>To give your router bits the best edge to get the job done, you should take them to a professional sharpener. They will be able to maintain the proper cut and shape of the bit while returning it to like-new sharpness.</p> <p>However, if you cannot take the bit to a sharpener, you can use diamond hones to remove a thin layer from the cutting blade’s two edges. Lubricate the diamond hone with water and lay the flat side of the bit against it. Stroke the bit back and forth across the hone, removing thin layers of the bit with each pass until the cutting edge is returned. To keep the bit balanced, be sure to stroke both sides of the bit an equal number of times.</p>",449
1137,electric screwdriver,"<p>If you still aren’t completely confident about which kind of electric screwdriver you need, take a look at these popular questions and their answers below.</p> <h3>Q. Is an impact driver the same as an electric screwdriver? </h3> <p>Impact drivers and electric screwdrivers share some similarities, but they are different tools. Think of an electric screwdriver as a smaller, lighter, and less powerful version of an impact driver. An electric screwdriver is designed for occasional use, while an impact driver can withstand frequent, prolonged usage. An impact driver is built for heavier-duty tasks—basically a mid-point between an electric screwdriver and a power drill.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose the right electric screwdriver? </h3> <p>Think of the tasks you’ll take on with the screwdriver. For light- to medium-duty tasks, like assembling furniture and hanging wall decorations, 3 to 7 volts are sufficient. Heavy-duty jobs involving high-density material like hardwood require 8 volts or more. The force produced by an electric screwdriver, or torque, ranges from 1 N.m on the lighter side up to 27 N.m for heavy-duty models.</p> <p>Battery life for electric screwdrivers varies from 0.5 Ah and 2.5 Ah, with higher values amounting to longer run times. Consider which of the following forms you prefer: fixed pistol grip, featuring a small handle and trigger operation; variable grip, allowing you to bend, rotate, and reposition the grip for enhanced maneuverability; and inline, featuring a straight grip that more closely resembles a manual screwdriver.</p> <p>Beyond these essential considerations, there are additional features you may prefer, such as variable speed, torque adjustment, built-in LED lights, and included screwdriver bits.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between mAh and Ah ratings in batteries?</h3> <p>1000 MilliAmp hours (mAh) is equal to 1 Amp-hour (Ah) and both are measurements of how much electrical current is discharged from a battery over a period of one hour. Higher numbers equate to a longer battery runtime for electric screwdrivers, with shorter lifespans being measured in mAh and longer lifespans measured in Ah.</p> <h3>Q. How can you make the battery life last longer in electric screwdrivers? </h3> <p>To make the battery life last longer in your electric screwdriver, always ensure that you charge the battery to full then use the screwdriver until the battery runs out. Don’t leave the battery charging longer than necessary and do not remove the battery from the charger if it only has a partial charge.</p> <p>When storing the electric screwdriver, store away from high heat or freezing temperatures. Also avoid storing the battery near magnetic objects and metals, as these materials can seep power from the battery.</p> <h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>For furniture assembly, home repairs, and other DIY jobs, electric screwdrivers are the Goldilocks of power tools. They’re more powerful and convenient than a manual screwdriver, yet lighter-duty compared to impact drivers and drills. Electric screwdrivers offer more precision and cost efficiency than impact drivers and drills. As such, they’re just right for many household applications.</p> <p>Electric screwdrivers vary in power, torque, battery life, and speed to suit different applications. With features like variable speed, adjustable grip, LED lights, built-in screw holders, and more, these tools are quite easy to use. By paying attention to these nuances, users can find their ideal tool and get the most out of it.</p>",539
1138,socket set,"<p>It’s important to know how to use and maintain a socket set in order to ensure that your new tools last as long as possible, so take a look below at the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about socket sets.</p> <h3>Q: What is in a regular socket set?</h3> <p>A traditional socket set will usually have two different ratcheting socket wrenches, one or two extension bars, a variety of basic sockets and specialty sockets for each wrench, and screwdriver bits that fit the smaller of the two wrenches.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use regular sockets with an impact wrench?</h3> <p>You should never use regular sockets with an impact wrench because regular sockets have a thinner wall that is susceptible to shattering when used with an impact wrench.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between black and chrome sockets?</h3> <p>Chrome sockets tend to be regular sockets that should be used with a standard socket wrench, while black sockets are usually made for impact wrenches. However, even if the socket is black, you should always check the product information or manufacturer’s information to ensure that it is rated for use with an impact wrench. Sockets that are not made for impact wrenches may shatter while in use.</p> <h3>Q: Do sockets rust?</h3> <p>Even quality tools will rust if they aren’t properly stored in a tool kit, and sockets are not an exception. That’s why it’s a good idea to look for socket sets that come in water-resistant plastic cases that can help to prevent the tools from getting damaged, even if you get caught in the rain.</p>",265
1139,track saw,"<p>That’s a lot of information about the best track saws, and it may seem a bit overwhelming. Don’t let a few nagging questions derail your shopping; the following section aims to answer the most frequently asked questions about the best track saws. Be sure to look below for an answer to your question.</p> <h3>Q. Is a circular saw the same as a track saw?</h3> <p>Track saws are based on sidewinder-style circular saws, but they’re not the same. Circular saws have smooth bases that glide along the workpiece. Track saws have grooves that snap into a track to allow for straight cuts.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a track saw without a track?</h3> <p>Yes, you can, but they’re not as easy to use without a track. The pressure it takes to hold the saw in the plunged position can affect accuracy.</p> <h3>Q. How deep can track saws cut?</h3> <p>Most track saws can cut just over 2 inches deep; however, some of the larger track saws can cut up to 2½ inches deep.</p> <h3>Q. How do you change the blade on a track saw?</h3> <p>Track saws usually have blade-change settings that lock the plunging action in place. Once it’s in the blade-change mode, the user simply loosens the arbor nut holding the blade in place and replaces the blade.</p>",216
1140,heated gloves,"<p>Heated gloves have been around for a couple of decades, but they have become more popular as glove materials have improved and batteries have gotten less bulky while being able to hold longer charges. It’s not unusual for shoppers to have a few questions.</p> <h3>Q. Are heated gloves machine washable?</h3> <p>Some are machine washable. A tag sewn into the glove’s lining (just inside the wrist) indicates whether you can launder the gloves without damaging them. Some can be hand washed, while others should only be wiped down with a damp cloth. Some can be machine washed in a separate “delicates” bag. When you clean them, avoid wringing out any excess water. That action can damage the heating wires.</p> <h3>Q. How long do heated gloves last?</h3> <p>The warmth from chemically heated gloves can last 8 to 10 hours, depending on the strength of the chemical packets. Battery-heated (electric) gloves generally stay warm for up to 6 hours before needing a recharge. Many have lifetime warranties. Over time, all batteries will eventually run down and hold less of a charge. You can charge a typical lithium-ion battery an average of 300 to 500 times before you need to replace it.</p>",198
1141,drill bit sharpener,"<p>If you wish that you knew about drill bit sharpeners a long time ago, you’re not alone. Many have wasted money on new bits when the old became dull. Now that you do know a bit about the best drill bit sharpeners, you might have some more questions. Below are the most frequently asked questions and answers about drill bit sharpeners. If you don’t find your answer here, contact the sharpener’s manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q: Are drill bits worth sharpening?</h3> <p>All bits are worth sharpening if you already have a sharpener. However, it’s not worth buying a sharpener to put an edge on a 1/8-inch steel drill bit.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a drill bit sharpener?</h3> <p>Each sharpener is different, but you, or the jig, hold the bit at a specific angle relative to a grinding wheel. The grinding wheel removes metal from the tip of the drill bit until the edge is sharp.</p> <h3>Q: What is the right angle to sharpen drill bits?</h3> <p>The two most common angles are 118 degrees and 135 degrees, though there are bits that use other angles.</p> <h3>Q: Can you sharpen Titanium drill bits?</h3> <p>You can, but they’ll never be quite as effective again. Titanium bits have a coating that the grinding wheel will remove when sharpening. That’s not to say the bits are no good; they just won’t have the hard coating that makes them so useful.</p>",233
1142,needle nose pliers,"<p>There can be a bit of a learning curve with needle-nose pliers, and shoppers may want further info about their new pair. Here are some commonly asked questions about these tools and their answers.</p> <h3>Q. How is wire stripped with needle-nose pliers?</h3> <p>Place the wire between the cutting jaws and lightly squeeze the grips to penetrate the wire’s coating (without cutting the wire). Then spin the pliers around the wire to cut through the entire jacket, and pull the jacket off with the serrated jaws of the pliers.</p> <h3>Q. Can broken needle-nose pliers be repaired?</h3> <p>It’s frustrating when tools fail, but we don’t recommend trying to fix broken needle-nose pliers. They’ll never work as well as they did from the factory. Worse, they could also become somewhat dangerous, causing blood blisters or cutting into skin if they fail again.</p> <h3>Q. Are long-nose and needle-nose pliers the same?</h3> <p>“Long-nose” and “needle-nose” pliers are technically the same, though true needle-nose pliers tend to be thinner than long-nose options. Today, however, the two terms are fairly interchangeable.</p>",174
1143,cordless screwdriver,"<p>There is a lot to consider when selecting a new cordless screwdriver, so there may be some lingering questions. If you’re still wondering about the ins and outs of cordless screwdrivers, check out these answers to some commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. What is a cordless screwdriver?</h3> <p>A cordless screwdriver is a battery-operated tool that tightens and loosens screws with a motor and a trigger instead of using the user’s hand power to operate a manual screwdriver.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a cordless screwdriver and a cordless drill?</h3> <p>Cordless drills accept several drill bit sizes with adjustable chucks, while cordless screwdrivers only accept ¼-inch bits. Also, cordless drills tend to have more adjustability in terms of speed to allow drilling into different materials accurately and efficiently.</p> <h3>Q. How do you operate a cordless screwdriver?</h3> <p>There are a few slightly different methods to operating a cordless screwdriver, but here is a general usage guideline:</p> <ol><li>Choose the right bit and place it in the chuck.</li><li>Adjust the direction you want to drive the screw (tighten or loosen) with the switch on the screwdriver.</li><li>Seat the bit completely into the head of the screw.</li><li>Maintain pressure on the fastener and squeeze the trigger.</li></ol>",197
1144,wood chisels,"<p>Those who still want more information about these versatile woodworking tools may find it below in the answers to some of the most common questions about chisels.</p> <h3>Q. How do you chisel wood for a door hinge?</h3> <p>After marking out where the hinge will go, use an adequately sharp 1¼-inch mortise or bench chisel to make several shallow cuts the same depth as the hinge. Follow up with horizontal slices to remove the notched-out area.</p> <h3>Q. How do you sharpen a wood chisel?</h3> <p>Use a sharpening stone, sandpaper, or a bench grinder to sharpen your wood chisel.</p> <h3>Q. What size chisels should I buy?</h3> <p>While the answer depends on intended use, ¼-inch, ½-inch, ¾-inch, and 1-inch bench chisels can handle most jobs.</p> <h3>Q. How do you store wooden chisels?</h3> <p>When not in use, chisels can be kept in a pouch or a case or on a storage rack or magnetic tool holder.</p>",152
1145,cobalt drill bits,"<p>Are you still wondering if cobalt bits are the best tool for the job? Read on for answers to the most common questions about cobalt drill bits.</p> <h3>Q. Can cobalt drill bits be sharpened?</h3> <p>While cobalt drill bits will hold up better against heat than other drill bits, they will need to be sharpened from time to time. Sharpen dull cobalt drill bits using a bench grinder.</p> <h3>Q. Are cobalt or titanium drill bits better?</h3> <p>Titanium drill bits are durable and will hold up much longer than standard high-speed steel drill bits, but they are not as strong as cobalt alloy, which will drill through hard metals, including titanium.</p> <h3>Q. What are the hardest drill bits?</h3> <p>M42 cobalt drill bits, which have 8 percent cobalt, are the hardest drill bits you can buy.</p>",133
1146,cordless hammer drill,"<p>If you’ve never used a hammer drill before, you might have some questions about the drills and how they work. You’ll find some of the most frequently asked questions and their answers listed below to help point you in the right direction.</p> <h3>Q: Can a hammer drill be used as a chisel?</h3> <p>You can use a rotary hammer as a chisel, but you can’t with a hammer drill. Rotary hammers have a mode that doesn’t spin the bit while hammering, making it ideal for chipping and chiseling.</p> <h3>Q: Can I turn the hammer drill part off and use it as a regular drill?</h3> <p>Yes, all hammer drills function as a drill driver, though they might be overkill for most projects around the house.</p> <h3>Q: Why is my hammer drill not hammering?</h3> <p>Here are a few reasons why your drill may not be hammering;</p> <ol><li>You’re not putting enough pressure on the bit. The drill needs to feel some resistance from the bit to hammer it into the material.</li><li>Your drill isn’t in hammer mode. There might be a dial on the side of the drill or a collar at the top of the machine that allows you to switch the drill into and out of hammer mode.</li><li>Your hammer gear might have broken. Most likely this is due to age or misuse, but it’s best to check into a new one if this is the case.</li></ol>",233
1147,torque wrench,"<p>Take a look at these helpful answers to some of the most common questions about torque wrenches.</p> <h3>Q. What is a torque wrench used for?</h3> <p>A torque wrench is a specialized tightening tool commonly used in the automotive industry. Despite ‘wrench’ being in its name, a torque wrench should never be used to loosen nuts, only for tightening them.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a torque wrench?</h3> <p>You can use a torque wrench to tighten nuts, but never for loosening. If the wrench you are using is a type that needs the torque to be set, then set the torque using the physical dial on the handle or the digital keypad. Place the drive bit on the nut or bolt and tighten until you reach the appropriate torque, which will be indicated differently for each type of torque wrench.</p> <h3>Q. How do you calibrate a torque wrench?</h3> <p>To calibrate a torque wrench on your own, you will need a bench vise, a 20-pound weight, a thin rope or string (capable of holding at least 20 pounds), and a measuring tape.</p> <ol><li>Measure the length of the torque wrench from the square drive on the head to the exact point on the handle where you grip the wrench. This line is commonly marked already on a torque wrench, so you shouldn’t have to estimate based on your average usage.</li><li>Put the square drive of the torque wrench into the vise and tighten it.</li><li>Set the torque wrench using the measurement you took in step one, and multiply it by 20.</li><li>Tie a loop through the 20-pound weight with the string and hang it from the end of the handle where you took your first measurement.</li><li>If you hear a click, lift the weight and move it towards the head of the wrench. Each time you put the weight down, if it clicks continue moving it until the clicking stops.</li><li>If you don’t initially hear a click, tighten the spring in the wrench by turning the screw clockwise, lift the weight and lower it again to test it, repeating the process in step five.</li><li>If done correctly, you should end up with a very precise area on the torque wrench where the weight can hang without causing the wrench to click.</li><li>Measure the length of the torque wrench from the square drive to the point where the weight is hanging and multiply this finding by 20 pounds.</li><li>With the information you have gathered, you can now calculate the applied torque of the wrench using the formula Ta = Ts x (D1/D2). Ta is applied torque. Ts is torque setting. D1 is the distance measured in step 1. D2 is the distance measured in step 8.</li><li>Using this number, you can multiply your intended torque by the difference to give you the correct torque setting for your specific torque wrench.</li></ol> <h3>Q. What are foot-pounds of torque?</h3> <p>A foot-pound is a unit of measurement used for measuring torque. One foot-pound of torque is equal to 1 pound of force operating at a perpendicular distance of 1 foot from the torque wrench’s pivot point.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a foot-pound torque wrench for inch-pounds? </h3> <p>Yes, you can. If you want to use a foot-pound torque wrench for inch-pounds just multiply the wrench’s foot-pounds by 12 to convert it to inch-pounds.</p>",545
1148,cordless impact wrench,"<p>A cordless impact wrench can be a considerable investment, so it’s natural to have some questions. Since there are many factors to consider and options to choose from, discovering the answers to these common questions might help bring more clarity to the decision.</p> <h3>Q. What is a cordless impact wrench used for?</h3> <p>A cordless impact wrench is used for loosening and tightening nuts and bolts, especially those that are too difficult to adjust with a manual socket set.</p> <h3>Q. How does a cordless impact wrench work?</h3> <p>It applies short bursts of intense twisting force to loosen or tighten.</p> <h3>Q. Which voltage should I choose for a cordless impact wrench?</h3> <p>That depends on what you’re going to use it for. If you’re mostly going to be working in tight spaces, a 12-volt impact wrench should be sufficient. On the other hand, if you’re working with 1-inch drive sockets, you’ll probably need a 20-volt impact wrench. For general-purpose use with the greatest versatility, an 18-volt impact wrench is probably your best bet.</p> <h3>Q. Will a cordless impact wrench remove lug nuts?</h3> <p>Absolutely! You can easily remove lug nuts with a ⅜-inch or ½-inch anvil.</p>",192
1149,benchtop planer,"<p>Alongside other popular power tools, such as band saws, table saws, and wood lathes, benchtop thickness planers are a boon in a woodworking shop. If this is your first planer, you will probably have questions about the tool’s best use and operation. Ahead are answers to some of the most common questions about benchtop planers. If you still want more information about your benchtop planer, refer to the user’s manual or contact the manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q. What is a bench planer used for?</h3> <p>Benchtop planers reduce the thickness of a board. Woodcrafters can use them to create consistent thicknesses on several boards for woodworking purposes or to uncover the beauty hidden underneath reclaimed wood.</p> <h3>Q. How is a benchtop planer used?</h3> <p>With the benchtop planer turned off, place a board in the intake feed slot. Lower the roller carriage (the top part of the planer) using the hand crank until it just touches the board. This is the starting point. Remove the board, and then use the crank to lower the roller carriage to the desired cutting depth (typically between 1/64 and 1/8 of an inch). The woodworker can use the ruler gauge to determine the cutting depth or use the crank rule of thumb—one full revolution of the crank equals 1/16 inch. Once the cutting height is decided, turn the planer on and slowly feed the board into the intake slot. The planer will do the rest—users don’t have to push the board.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a jointer and a planer?</h3> <p>Planers reduce the thickness of a board by shaving a uniform amount of wood off its surface. Jointers make the board flat by shaving away only the high spots, not the entire surface, as a planer does.</p> <h3>Q. How much does a planer weigh?</h3> <p>Wood planers can be some of the heaviest tools in your shop. Benchtop planers weigh an average of between 60 and 100 pounds, so it may be wise to keep it on a benchtop rather than moving it around.</p>",337
1150,oscillating tool,"<p>If you still have some questions about the best oscillating tools, that’s understandable. These tools serve so many purposes that it’s tough to know everything about them. Below, you’ll find a collection of the most common questions about oscillating tools and their answers. If you still have questions after reading this section, reach out to your oscillating tool manufacturer’s customer service department.</p> <h3>Q: How does an oscillating tool work?</h3> <p>Oscillating tools swing blades back and forth in very small arcs. These arcs allow the teeth of a blade or grit on a piece of sandpaper to dig into surfaces while remaining very easy to control.</p> <h3>Q: What is an oscillating tool used for?</h3> <p>Oscillating tools have a range of applications. You can use them to cut lap joints on woodworking pieces, make plunge cuts in cabinets for plumbing, cut holes for electrical boxes, remove grout, sand woodwork, and for many other projects.</p> <h3>Q: Can an oscillating tool cut nails?</h3> <p>Yes, although cutting nails with an oscillating tool requires a metal blade, which is usually carbide. These blades can easily cut through nails and other metal objects like pipes and fittings.</p>",190
1151,hand saw,"<p>If you still have questions about your new hand saw, check out these common questions.</p> <h3>Q: How do you start a saw cut?</h3> <p>Use your thumb to help line up the saw blade with the cut line. Start with the teeth nearest to the handle. Make sure to start the cut next to the line, on the waste side. Make a few back cuts until you create a defined opening in the wood. Position the saw at a 45-degree angle with the material. With your elbow close to your body, start with a few short forward strokes to deepen the cut. Then, begin making longer strokes.</p> <h3>Q: How do you sharpen a hand saw?</h3> <p>To sharpen a handsaw properly, clamp the saw’s blade in a vice between two scrap wood pieces with the blade side facing up. Make sure the clamp grips the blade close to the cutting edge. Use a double-cut metal file to file the teeth until they are uniform height.</p> <h3>Q: How do you lubricate a hand saw?</h3> <p>To prevent rust, lubricate your saw after every use. You can use a variety of lubricants, including WD-40, gun oil, or paste wax. In addition to preventing the metal from oxidizing, the lubricant will also help the blade slide through the wood.</p>",213
1152,ratcheting screwdriver,"<p>If you’re still a little twisted up about buying the best ratcheting screwdriver, the following section will help. It includes some of the most frequently asked questions and answers about ratcheting screwdrivers.</p> <h3>Q. How does a ratcheting screwdriver work?</h3> <p>Ratcheting screwdrivers use a gear and a pawl to allow the shaft to rotate independently on the backstroke and engage the shaft on the forward twist. As the handle rotates backward, the pawl skips over the teeth, allowing the shaft to remain still. As the handle rotates forward, the pawl grabs the gear, engaging the shaft and rotating it with the handle.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a ratchet screwdriver and a standard screwdriver? </h3> <p>Standard screwdriver shafts are permanently fixed to the handle, so every twist of the handle twists the tip. Ratcheting screwdrivers engage and disengage from the shaft, allowing you to twist the handle back and forth while only driving the fastener in one direction.</p> <h3>Q. How do you remove a bit from a ratchet screwdriver?</h3> <p>Most ratchet screwdrivers use ball detents or magnets to hold their bits in place. In either case, removing the bit simply requires pulling the bit straight out of the shaft.</p>",199
1153,hand tools,"<p>If you’re just getting started collecting hand tools for your workshop, you likely have some questions about which ones are essential and how to care for them.</p> <h3>Q. What are essential hand tools?</h3> <p>Essential hand tools are those that let you make home or auto repairs and complete around-the-house projects. While a lot of specialty tools are out there, the most commonly used tools include screwdrivers, hammers, ratchet sets, utility knives, and tape measures.</p> <h3>Q. Which tool material is hardest? </h3> <p>In hand tools, that’s probably S2, an alloy that contains carbon, silicon, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, and manganese. Most hand tools, however, are made from other types of steel, including carbon steel and case-hardened steel.</p> <h3>Q. What are the factors affecting tool life?</h3> <p>Moisture is the natural enemy of metal hand tools, and leaving tools outside in the weather will reduce their useful life quicker than anything.</p> <h3>Q. How do you keep hand tools in good condition?</h3> <p>Good tool maintenance practices will keep your hand tools in top working condition. Keep them dry, clean, and stored in a dust-free environment. Additionally, use your tools only for their designated use—if you use a screwdriver in place of a chisel and hit it with a hammer, it likely won’t hold up to the abuse.</p>",211
1154,portable workbench,"<p>If you’re wondering which qualities to look for in a workbench, keep reading for some of the most frequently asked questions about the top portable workbenches.</p> <h3>Q. What makes a good portable workbench?</h3> <p>A quality portable workbench should be durable enough to handle the rigors of a home workshop or pro job site. It should have a sturdy base that prevents it from wobbling while you work. It should include clamping features to hold materials securely in place. A portable workbench also should break down in seconds into a shape that’s compact and light enough for one person to manage.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the optimal height for a workbench?</h3> <p>Unlike dining room tables or kitchen counters, no standard workbench height exists. Workbench heights can range from 28 inches to 38 inches. Workbench heights on the high end are suitable for assembling items and to function as outfeed tables for table saws, while lower workbench heights allow for more leverage for such jobs as sanding. If you’re not sure which height you need, use this literal rule of thumb—the benchtop should meet the same level as the knuckle in your thumb when standing with your arms hanging at your sides.</p> <h3>Q. How much weight can a portable workbench handle?</h3> <p>The weight capacity of workbenches varies. Lighter-duty workbenches can handle a weight of around 250 pounds, which is adequate for most home workshops, while a heavy-duty workbench may have a weight capacity as high as 1,000 pounds.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a portable workbench last?</h3> <p>Most portable workbenches use plastic in their design. While this makes them much lighter than a permanent workbench, plastic isn’t as durable as wood or steel. Plus, portable workbenches have movable joints that allow them to collapse, making them weaker than a standard workbench with no moving parts. With that in mind, most portable workbenches should last many years when properly maintained.</p>",314
1155,band saws,"<p>Now that you know more about band saws and the most important features to consider, you may still have questions about the tools. Below you’ll find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about how band saws work. If you still have questions, reach out to your saw’s manufacturer and speak to a customer service representative.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a band saw to cut metal?</h3> <p>Yes, you can cut metal with a band saw. In many cases, band saws are actually the best way to cut metal. When cutting metal, it’s important to fit the saw with a metal saw band.</p> <h3>Q: Do I need specific saw blades for different cuts?</h3> <p>You might need a different saw band for different materials and different types of cuts. Resawing chunks of hardwood into usable boards might require a ripping band, while you can make most other cuts with an all-purpose blade.</p> <p>Blades meant for cutting metal have many more teeth per inch than those meant for wood or woodworking, so it’s essential to match the right blade to the right material.</p> <h3>Q: How do I sharpen band saw blades?</h3> <p>The easiest way to sharpen band saw teeth is with a file. Hold the file parallel to the saw’s cutting edge and make a few careful passes to put a fresh edge on the front of each tooth.</p> <h3>Q: What is the teeth per inch (TPI) on a band saw?</h3> <p>Teeth per inch (TPI) refers to the number of teeth within 1 inch of the blade’s length. Blades meant for metalworking will have higher TPI ratings from 6 to 24 TPI. Blades for cutting wood will have lower TPIs from 3 to 6 TPI.</p>",284
1156,work boots for men,"<p>A pair of quality work boots is an investment in your health, safety, and comfort that can help you be more productive at work and less fatigued at the end of the day. Get the most from your investment by taking care of your boots. Read on for a few helpful tips.</p> <h3>Q: How long does it take to break in your boots?</h3> <p>It takes two to three weeks, or up to 100 hours of wear, to break in a new pair of boots. During the break-in period, apply boot oil to the areas of the boot that need a little stretch, like the vamp/toe area, but not to the areas that provide support, such as the ankle.</p> <h3>Q: How do you maintain your work boots?</h3> <p>When boots get dirty, clean them with a nylon brush and water-based cleaner. Apply leather conditioner periodically to keep leather parts supple. Loosen the laces, spread the opening, and allow them to dry thoroughly after wear. Eliminate any odors by sprinkling the insides with baking soda and letting them sit overnight.</p> <h3>Q: How long does a pair of work boots last?</h3> <p>Depending on the work environment, the life span of a pair of work boots averages between six and 12 months. Long hours in wet, muddy, rocky, and other harsh environments may wear them down faster.</p>",222

If you still have questions about which light best suits your needs, check out these frequently asked questions and their corresponding answers.</p> <h3>Q. What type of LED work light do I need?</h3> <p>The best LED work light will depend on your task, your location, and the current lighting in your environment.</p> <h3>Q. How many lumens do I need for a work light?</h3> <p>While estimates vary, a general rule of thumb is 130 to 150 lumens per square foot of workspace, but personal preferences, eye health, and the wall colors in your environment will have an impact.</p> <h3>Q. Are LED work lights durable? </h3> <p>Durability varies by brand and price point, but LED work lights are generally made to be durable for expected use on construction sites. Look for items that are protected by shields and rubber that prevents damage if you drop the light.</p>",162
1158,benchtop jointer,"<p>Benchtop jointers are one-trick ponies, so it may seem that only serious woodworkers and DIYers would own one. It would be understandable if you had some questions about how they work or what they do. These tools don’t have to be so intimidating if you have the right information. Below is a list of the most frequently asked questions about benchtop jointers.</p> <h3>Q: What is a benchtop jointer?</h3> <p>A benchtop jointer is a scaled-down version of a floor-standing jointer. These tools sit on your workbench and allow you to mill warps, twists, and bows out of your lumber or hardwood by removing material until it’s completely flat.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between a jointer and a planer?</h3> <p>A planer removes thickness, allowing users to peel off layers of wood until the workpiece is of the appropriate thickness. Jointers remove material in order to flatten the board.</p> <h3>Q: How big of a jointer do I need?</h3> <p>For most home shops, a 6-inch benchtop jointer will work quite well. It’s large enough to pass most DIY project-related boards through but small enough that you can remove it from your bench when you’re not using it.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a benchtop jointer?</h3> <p>Jointing is a labor of love, and it takes a bit of patience. To start, ensure that the infeed side of the table is just slightly lower than the outfeed side with the height adjustment knob. Turn the machine on and feed the board over the spinning cutter head using the paddles and push sticks that your jointer came with. Continue making several passes, checking the board between with a straight edge.</p>",274
1159,biscuit joiner,"<p>While you may be excited about getting started with your new tool, if you still want more info, refer to the answers to these frequently asked questions about biscuit joiners and how they work. If you don’t see the information you need here, reach out to the manufacturer’s customer service department and speak with a representative.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a plane, a jointer, and a biscuit joiner?</h3> <p>There are planes, jointers, and biscuit joiners, and they each work differently. A plane is a handheld tool that comes in different sizes and is used for flattening high spots or removing material from a board’s surface. A jointer is typically a floor-mounted power tool (though there are benchtop models as well) that’s used to create a perfectly flat and square board. A biscuit joiner creates slots for biscuits within a joint, creating extra glue surface and perfect orientation for joinery.</p> <h3>Q. What speed should I look for in a biscuit joiner?</h3> <p>To ensure that your biscuit joiner can handle hardwoods, look for one with a 9,000 rpm or higher top speed.</p> <h3>Q. How deep does a biscuit joiner cut?</h3> <p>Most biscuit joiners can cut as deeply as 3/4 inch, providing more than enough room for a #20 biscuit.</p> <h3>Q. How many biscuits should I use to join wood?</h3> <p>A good rule of thumb is to use a biscuit every 6 to 12 inches. For weight-bearing projects like shelves and countertops, 6 inches is best to provide support.</p> <h3>Q. What materials can a biscuit joiner work with?</h3> <p>You can use biscuits with a range of wood-based products: hardwoods, softwoods, plywood, MDF, and even laminated particleboard can work with a biscuit joiner.</p>",281
1160,cordless ratchet,"<p>Continue reading below to find the answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about cordless ratchets.</p> <h3>Q: How does a cordless ratchet work?</h3> <p>A cordless ratchet uses a battery to drive a motor which in turn rotates the ratchet head. This automatic function is used with a socket to remove nuts and bolts without having to use any manual force beyond pushing the power trigger.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a cordless ratchet?</h3> <p>A cordless ratchet is used by attaching a compatible socket to the ratchet head and lining it up with the nut or bolt you want to tighten or loosen. Once the socket is sitting securely over the nut or bolt head you can press the power trigger to begin applying pressure to the socket, forcing the nut or bolt to turn. Typically you will have a variable speed trigger that allows you to control the speed without designated power levels.</p> <h3>Q: How long does a cordless ratchet last?</h3> <p>On average, a cordless ratchet will last five to 10 years with regular use and proper care.</p>",180
1161,crimping tool,"<p>Those new to crimping tools may still want more info on how to shop for and use them. Check out the answers to commonly asked questions below.</p> <h3>Q: What is wire crimping? </h3> <p>Crimping securely attaches electrical connectors to relevant cable. Types and sizes can vary enormously, from those on computer circuit boards to mains (the high-voltage cables that bring power to your home).</p> <h3>Q: Is soldering better than crimping? </h3> <p>It’s not a matter of better; it’s about doing what’s appropriate for the project. Soldering is largely used for attaching wires permanently, whereas crimping is common for connections that can be disassembled.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a crimping tool? </h3> <p>The most important considerations are ensuring the tool can handle the type of terminal you need to attach as well as the appropriate wire sizes.</p>",134
1162,sledgehammer,"<p>Read on to find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about sledgehammers and how to use them in your next demolition and renovation project.</p> <h3>Q. What is a sledgehammer used for?</h3> <p>Sledgehammers are primarily used for demolition work, like breaking concrete, removing walls, or taking down cabinets. However, they also serve as a heavy-duty tool for more constructive purposes, such as building a fence or getting in a good workout, especially when paired with a large tire.</p> <h3>Q. How heavy should my sledgehammer be?</h3> <p>This depends on the work being completed, though a sledgehammer can range in weight from just 2 pounds to as much as 20 pounds. Choose lightweight sledgehammers when the object being struck is smaller or requires a higher degree of control.</p> <p>Heavy-duty sledgehammers are a force of destruction when used correctly. Use these tools for breaking concrete, walls, or working out. A full-size sledgehammer will not fit inside a tool box, so place it inside the workshop or garage cabinet for safe storage. Have a lightweight handheld sledgehammer that can travel in the tool box as well.</p> <h3>Q. Can a sledgehammer break concrete?</h3> <p>Yes, a sledgehammer can break concrete. In fact, breaking concrete is one of the main purposes tool companies design a sledgehammer to accomplish.</p> <h3>Q. How do you swing a sledgehammer?</h3> <p>To use a lightweight sledgehammer, simply swing it in the same way that you would a normal hammer. However, to use a heavy-duty sledgehammer, the grip and process are more complex.</p> <ol><li>Grip the sledgehammer with one hand positioned on the handle, and one positioned near the head of the tool.</li><li>Pick the hammer up over the head, and as the hammer is lifted up, slide the hand positioned near the head toward the handle.</li><li>From this overhead position, the user can swing the head of the hammer downward with significant force to break concrete or tear down drywall.</li><li>After impact, slide one hand back down to the head of the sledgehammer and raise it again.</li></ol>",332
1163,router table,"<p>If you’re still wondering which characteristics to look for in a quality router table, read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best material for a router tabletop?</h3> <p>The best material for a router tabletop is cast iron. This is the flattest, sturdiest, and most durable material. It’s also the most expensive and is therefore used only in professional shops. Cast aluminum and phenolic resin are the best affordable options for home woodshops.</p> <h3>Q: How thick should a router table be?</h3> <p>A good router table should be at least 1 inch thick to prevent sagging. Material is also a factor when it comes to thickness. While a metal or high-quality resin tabletop can be thinner than 1 inch and still be sturdy, MDF must be thicker to resist bending.</p> <h3>Q: Will my router fit the table?</h3> <p>Most router tables include multiple base plates that accommodate all major brands of routers. It’s important to check a specific table’s list of compatible routers before purchasing it.</p> <h3>Q: Can a plunge router be used in a table?</h3> <p>A plunge router can be used on a router table and is just as safe as a fixed-base router.</p> <h3>Q: How do you set up a router table?</h3> <p>Begin by attaching the baseplate of the router table to the router using the mounting screws. For a freestanding table, once the router is installed, it’s ready for action. A benchtop router table requires a steady base. Set the benchtop router table on a sturdy workbench or table, and use clamps to clamp the router base to the table to prevent it from sliding while in use.</p>",277

The following is a collection of some of the most frequently asked questions about low profile floor jacks. Be sure to check for an answer to your question listed below.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a floor jack and a trolley jack? </h3> <p>While some may claim that there are differences between floor and trolley jacks, there really aren’t. They’re essentially the same tool under a different name.</p> <h3>Q. How do you jack up a low profile car?</h3> <p>Jacking up a low profile car involves a few steps:</p> <ol><li>Ensure the emergency brake is engaged and working, or use wheel chocks to keep the vehicle from rolling.</li><li>Slide the low profile floor jack underneath the vehicle and place the saddle under the jacking point.</li><li>Pump the jack handle until the saddle is touching the jacking point, and then position the jack where it’s comfortable to use but out of the way while working.</li><li>Standing beside the vehicle, pump the handle until the vehicle is up off the ground to a sufficient height.</li><li>Be sure to lift the jacking handle back into the upright position to avoid tripping and accidentally adjusting the jack while it’s engaged.</li><li>Place jack stands under the vehicle to ensure it can’t fall while you’re working on it.</li></ol> <h3>Q. What is the proper placement on a car for a floor jack?</h3> <p>The manufacturer’s manual will have the jacking points clearly listed, but you can also jack from the control arms by each wheel or anywhere they’re a structural frame member. Be sure not to crush any wiring, brake line, fuel lines, or other components with the saddle.</p>",284
1167,shop stool,"<p>For additional information about choosing and using the best shop stool for your garage or workshop, check out the answers to some commonly asked questions about these products.</p> <h3>Q. How do pneumatic stools work?</h3> <p>Pneumatic height adjustment shop stools use pressurized air to lift and lower the seat. The more pressurized air in the pneumatic tube, the higher the seat sits. Lowering the stool pushes out air.</p> <h3>Q. How tall should a shop stool be?</h3> <p>The ideal height of the shop stool depends on both the height of the user and the height of the workbench or project. A stool shouldn’t cause you to bend over the top of projects or stretch upward just to properly see your project. For the best results, consider a shop stool with an adjustable height setting.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the best place to store my shop stool?</h3> <p>Consider your shop setup to find a location where you can store the stool safely out of the way, but within easy reach. A few good places include a free corner of the workshop or garage, tucked under a raised workbench, or right next to the workbench.</p>",189
1168,wood router for beginners,"<p>With the main criteria in mind for choosing the best wood router for beginner woodworkers, plus a list of top picks to choose from, you might be ready to go. However, wood routing is a complex subject, so it’s quite possible that a few questions remain. Here are answers to some additional common queries.</p> <h3>Q. How do I choose a wood router?</h3> <p>It’s important to think about the tasks you want to perform. A 1/4-inch model often works best for beginner woodworkers because they are light and easy to maneuver. However, if you regularly need to make heavy cuts, a 1/2-inch router will be a better choice.</p> <h3>Q. How deep can a wood router cut?</h3> <p>It depends on the capability of the router and the size of the bit. Generally, somewhere between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 inches will suffice. However, many router cuts are done on the side of material or for molding purposes, so maximum depth is seldom the most important consideration.</p> <h3>Q. What speed should my wood router be?</h3> <p>Precise speed isn’t a key issue unless you have a large router cutter with a particular rating. Type is more important. Fixed speed routers can cope with most jobs, but when using large cutters, a variable speed model is invaluable. Another consideration is that a variable speed router gives the beginner more versatility—and hence more opportunity to learn—than a fixed speed model.</p> <h3>Q. How do I use a wood router for beginners?</h3> <p>The key issue is stability of the tool and workpiece. If you approach a loose piece of wood with a router cutter spinning at 20,000 rpm or more, the risk of an accident goes way up. Make sure the workpiece is clamped securely. Until you have gained some experience, work horizontally and keep a firm grip on the router with both hands. Get some practice with scrap pieces before tackling a “real” job.</p>",317
1169,back saw,"<p>Having read through our considerations and taken a close look at some of the top-rated options, you’re now in a much better position to choose the best back saw for your needs. That said, you may have questions that are as yet unanswered. The following section covers many of the most frequently asked queries.</p> <h3>Q. Can a back saw cut metal?</h3> <p>In general, a back saw is a woodworking tool, though you could occasionally use it to cut soft metals like aluminum, brass, and copper. If you need to cut metal regularly, especially steel, you should buy a hacksaw.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to sharpen my back saw?</h3> <p>If you frequently use a backsaw, it is likely to need sharpening eventually. Fortunately, doing so is not difficult. For practical help, you can refer to the article here. Back saws with induction hardened teeth cannot be sharpened as they’re too hard. However, they do last much longer than blades with stamped teeth.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain my back saw?</h3> <p>Keeping your back saw in peak condition is relatively easy. Giving the blade an occasional wipe with paste wax will help prevent rust. You could use light machine oil, but it might transfer to your workpiece. If practical, give the back saw its own storage area so the teeth don’t bang against other tools. If the saw has a wooden handle, as many do, keep it as dry as possible and occasionally wax it.</p> <h3>Q. How long will my back saw last?</h3> <p>A back saw should last at least several years, even with heavy use. Some of the best dovetail and gent’s saws can be considered “heirloom” tools. With a bit of care, they can last a lifetime.</p>",287
1170,detail sander,"<p>Sand, smooth, shape, and finish fine furniture, doors, and more with a detail sander. If you aren’t completely sure how to use a detail sander or what grit of sandpaper would be best, take a look at the answers below to these and some other commonly asked questions about detail sanders.</p> <h3>Q. What is a detail sander used for?</h3> <p>A detail sander can be used on a range of different woodworking projects, like refinishing a door, table, cabinet, or dresser. The purpose of this type of sander is to sand corners, tight spaces, and any detailed patterns or designs that you may want to sand into the wood.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a detail sander?</h3> <p>To use a detail sander, first equip it with a piece of sandpaper, and then connect the battery or power cord. Turn on the sander and lower it to the material. You don’t need to force the sander down into the wood. Take it slow and allow the detail sander to remove the top layer of material to expose a smooth surface. Move the sander over the entire piece or the desired area. Next, turn off the sander and clean up the dust.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know which sandpaper to use?</h3> <p>Sandpaper is organized by grit. Sandpaper that has lower numbers like 40- to 50-grit indicate coarse sandpaper, while high numbers begin at about 120-grit and exceed 220-grit. These higher numbers signify fine or extra-fine sandpaper. Coarse sandpaper is used to remove a lot of material at a fast pace, but it can leave some roughness behind. Fine sandpaper can’t remove a lot of material, but the finish is soft and smooth. Choose the sandpaper that best suits your goals.</p> <h3>Q. Why won’t sandpaper stick to my sander?</h3> <p>If sandpaper won’t stick to your detail sander, it’s likely that the sander pad needs to be cleaned or replaced. Sander pads can get dirty during use and may just need to be cleaned. If the pad is damaged or worn out, it will need to be replaced.</p>",343
1171,cordless finish nailer,"<p>The in-depth look at the technical specifications of cordless finish nailers above explains many aspects of these versatile tools. However, there may be some specific areas that need clarification when it comes to different types of nailers. The following provides answers to questions that crop up regularly.</p> <h3>Q: Can a finish nailer be used for framing?</h3> <p>No, it’s not recommended. Framing nails are longer and thicker than finish nails to provide a stronger fix. A 15-gauge cordless finish nailer comes close, but you’re better off using a framing nailer.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a finish nailer?</h3> <p>It’s basically as easy as resting the tip of the tool against the workpiece and pulling the trigger. Check out the helpful article here to improve technique and results.</p> <h3>Q: Can a finish nailer use brad nails?</h3> <p>No. The nails for a brad nail gun are thinner at 18-gauge. Finish nails are 15- or 16-gauge with a more prominent head. As a result, brad and finish nails are not interchangeable.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain my cordless finish nailer?</h3> <p>Regular cleaning will reduce jamming caused by trapped dirt. Lubrication should ensure the mechanism functions properly. Manufacturers provide maintenance instructions, and following them will extend the working life of your tool.</p>",207

Wood and metal blades are for cutting their respective materials, but construction or demolition blades offer a combination of both.</p> <h3>Q: Can I use a reciprocating saw to cut tree branches? </h3> <p>Yes, a cordless reciprocating saw fitted with a wood blade is an excellent tool for cutting tree branches.</p> <h3>Q: How do you use a reciprocating saw? </h3> <p>To use a reciprocating saw:</p> <ol><li>Don your safety gear (gloves, safety glasses, and eye protection).</li><li>With the battery disconnected, open the blade clamp and insert the appropriate blade.</li><li>Connect a battery.</li><li>Assuming a stable position, put one hand on the foregrip and one on the handle (for one-handed models, this might not be possible).</li><li>Place the blade on the material you’re preparing to cut.</li><li>Slowly squeeze the trigger, and allow it to cut a groove into the material.</li><li>Slowly increase the speed.</li><li>Release the trigger when you’ve cut through the material.</li></ol> <h3>Q: How long will my reciprocating saw last? </h3> <p>Older corded reciprocating saws have been known to last for decades, but professionals can get several years out of cordless reciprocating saws.</p>",290
1173,combination square,"<p>This guide provides a comprehensive description of the key features in the best combination squares. However, given the variety of tools available and the various uses for them, a number of questions may remain. The following answers address those frequently asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. How do I use a combination square?</h3> <p>The versatility offered by a combination square is one of its main attractions. You can use the ruler to check length or the handle as a base for checking height or depth recesses. Use the “square” portion to mark or check 45- and 90-degree angles, and the bubble, if included, checks level.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain a combination square?</h3> <p>As with any tool, dirt is the main problem. Periodically disassemble and clean the components with a nonabrasive scourer and a little spirit or rubbing alcohol to remove deposits. After it dries, give the blade slide a light wipe with paste wax to lubricate it.</p> <h3>Q. How accurate are combination squares?</h3> <p>Accuracy depends on the model and its age. Many are manufactured to tolerances of 0.001 inch; however, friction can eventually impact the screw threads and guideways, which become looser over time. Quality tools will last many years, but budget models must be replaced more frequently.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know if a combination square is accurate?</h3> <p>To test the square’s accuracy, use a piece of board with a flat, machined edge, such as plywood or MDF. With the head set at one end of the ruler, place the tool against the edge of the board as if checking for square. With a sharp pencil, draw a line along the blade. Flip the combination square over, so the head creates a mirror image. Place the base at the bottom of the first line and draw a second line along the blade. The two lines should be parallel. If they form a shallow “V,” the square is not accurate and should be calibrated.</p> <h3>Q. How do I set or calibrate a combination square?</h3> <p>Loosen and remove the blade. Check that the groove in which the blade runs is clean; even a tiny particle of dirt can force the blade out of square. Reassemble and check it again following the procedure in the previous answer. If it still doesn’t align properly, adjust the blade groove with fine metal sandpaper wrapped around the blade itself or a fine needle file. Think carefully about which side to work on to correct the angle. Work slowly and check it frequently until the issue is resolved.</p>",420
1174,jigsaw blades,"<p>The information above is intended to provide a thorough understanding of how to choose the best jigsaw blades for particular tasks. The inclusion of these top picks has supported that understanding with a comprehensive selection of real-world examples. Nevertheless, for those who still have questions that remain unanswered, the following section seeks to answer some common queries about jigsaw blades.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between T-shank and U-shank jigsaw blades?</h3> <p>The letter—T or U—describes the shape at the top of the blade where it clamps inside the jigsaw. Almost all manufacturers now use T-shank blades. U-shank blades may still be required for older tools.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between an orbital jigsaw and a regular jigsaw?</h3> <p>On a regular jigsaw, the blade moves straight up and down. On an orbital model, it also moves forward and back, following an elliptical path that makes for a more efficient cutting action.</p> <h3>Q. Is more teeth on a saw blade better?</h3> <p>Not necessarily. More teeth result in a smoother finish, but fewer teeth produce a faster cut. The material being sawed also factors in.</p> <h3>Q. Can I cut curves with a jigsaw?</h3> <p>Definitely. One of the benefits of a jigsaw is its versatility. A jigsaw can cut freehand curves, or accessories are available to cut accurate circles.</p> <h3>Q. Can I cut a straight line with a jigsaw?</h3> <p>Yes. For accurate lines, use a guide rail clamped to the workpiece. Check out this useful guide to using a jigsaw here.</p> <h3>Q. How do I change a jigsaw blade?</h3> <p>It’s advisable to wear a glove after recent usage of the tool because the old blade may be very hot. The blade is clamped either by an Allen screw or a tool-free mechanism that is part of the jigsaw, and a couple of turns loosens it. Though it may require turning 90 degrees, the blade is easy to pull out, depending on the mechanism. Then, insert the new blade into the slot and retighten the clamp.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean a saw blade?</h3> <p>If a saw blade becomes gummed up with sap, resin, or glue, a quick wipe down with spirit or rubbing alcohol will often clean it off. Some people dip blades in a solution of laundry detergent; others use oven cleaner, and commercial saw-cleaning products are also available. That said, many users treat jigsaw blades as disposable items that they can simply replace rather than cleaning them.</p>",406
1175,screw extractor,"<p>If you have additional questions about how to use a screw extractor, read on for answers to some common queries about these handy tools.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the use of the drill bit on the extractor?</h3> <p>The drill bit is a crucial part of the extractor that is used to bore a hole in the head of the damaged bolt or screw, creating a place for the extractor to penetrate and grip the screw head so you can remove it.</p> <h3>Q. What’s a screw extractor’s ideal length?</h3> <p>There really is no standard length for a screw extractor. In fact, short and long extractors work equally well at removing damaged screws and bolts. It’s more important to choose the correct diameter drill bit and extractor to suit the damaged fastener.</p> <h3>Q. How do I know which size extractor to use?</h3> <p>To determine the proper extractor size, begin by choosing the proper drill-bit size. The drill bit should be about half the diameter of the screw head. For example, to remove a 0.375-inch screw, begin by drilling a hole in the head with a 3/16-inch drill bit. Once the hole is drilled, use an extractor that’s slightly smaller than the drill bit—most kits conveniently match the bits on the kit to the extractor. The slightly smaller extractor should fit inside the hole but still be tight enough that its threads can lock into the hole’s contours.</p>",233
1176,air impact wrench,"<p>The information provided here is a comprehensive overview of these tools and should help you find the best air impact wrench for your needs. We back the information with a host of real-world examples of the top tools available. However, a number of questions crop up frequently, so yours may be answered below.</p> <h3>Q: What does “impacts per minute” mean, and why is it important?</h3> <p>Impacts per minute (IPM), also referred to as “blows per minute” (BPM), is how fast the tool’s internal hammer action works to help loosen tough fixings. However, as explained, it’s just one factor to consider.</p> <h3>Q: Are air impact wrenches adjustable?</h3> <p>The best air impact wrenches contain a “power regulator” (also called an “air pressure flow switch”) to adjust the air supply independently of the compressor. This effectively allows more precise control of torque. It’s sometimes referred to as speed control, though technically, that’s not an accurate term.</p> <h3>Q: Are electric impact wrenches as good as cordless models?</h3> <p>It depends on the task. The best cordless impact wrenches are powerful but convenient tools, particularly for light-duty tasks. However, some struggle with higher torque demands, and runtimes can be modest. Corded electric impact wrenches often compete with their air-powered rivals. In many cases, although an electric impact wrench may be a good choice for a home garage or the job site, most automotive and engineering professionals choose an air tool, perhaps in part because a compressor is usually available.</p> <h3>Q: Is drive size an important feature?</h3> <p>Drive size describes the size of the socket that the impact wrench uses. Most measure either ⅜ inch or ½ inch. If you already own impact-compatible sockets, this is important. Adapters are available, but using one is not an ideal solution. If buying both an air impact wrench and sockets, a ½-inch drive model is generally the more powerful.</p> <h3>Q: What size impact wrench do I need to remove lug nuts?</h3> <p>Removing lug nuts requires around 100 ft.-lbs. of torque, so it’s a good idea to have an impact wrench that offers at least 150 ft.-lbs. While some electric impact wrenches might struggle to achieve this, most air impact wrenches can do so comfortably. Never put lug nuts back on with an air impact wrench, because you can easily overtighten them or strip the threads. Use a manual torque wrench to set them to the tightness recommended by the vehicle manufacturer.</p> <h3>Q: What is the optimum psi required for an air impact wrench?</h3> <p>Each tool has its own demands. Air wrenches need anywhere from 80 to 150 psi, so it’s a figure that should be checked like air consumption.</p>",439

1178,corded circular saw,"<p>The information above provides a close look at how these tools function and highlights a number of key features. Further detail comes from the top picks for the best corded circular saw in a number of different categories. That said, it’s possible there may still be a few unanswered questions. The following addresses those that come up often.</p> <h3>Q: Is it hard to maintain a corded saw?</h3> <p>Not at all, though there is an easy routine that will help extend the working life of both blade and saw:</p> <ul><li>Clean the saw when you’re finished for the day and store it away from humidity to prevent rust.</li><li>Change the blade immediately if there are any signs of damage or when it fails to cut effectively. A dull blade puts excess strain on the motor.</li><li>If you’re cutting sappy lumber, clean residue from the blade with mineral spirits or acetone.</li><li>Depending on the type of circular saw, there may be brushes in the motor that will wear out eventually. However, they can last several years and are not difficult to change when necessary.</li><li>Worm drive and hypoid gears need regular lubrication.</li></ul> <h3>Q: Do corded saws consume a lot of electricity?</h3> <p>They are not the least power-hungry of tools, though it depends on size. The wattage rating of the motor tells you the actual consumption. For a circular saw, 1,200 watts is considered average. None in this group dropped below 900 watts; neither were there any that exceeded 2,000 watts.</p> <h3>Q: How long should the cord extension be to move freely?</h3> <p>Even the best corded circular saw only has a cord 6 or 8 feet long, and this can feel restrictive. Most woodworkers plug into an extension to allow more freedom of movement. Just 12 or 15 feet should be plenty, though you can use up to 50 feet if an outlet isn’t nearby. A useful tip for cord safety is to loop it over your shoulder so that it trails behind you. That way you never risk getting it in the way of the blade.</p> <h3>Q: Are corded saws childproof?</h3> <p>No. They should be kept out of children’s reach even when unplugged. The blade guard might catch inquisitive fingers, and if it pushed back, it would reveal teeth that could be sharp enough to cut flesh.</p>",380
1179,rotary hammer drill,"<p>The article above contains a lot of valuable information that explains the technical aspects of these tools and can help you choose the best rotary hammer drill for your needs. However, during our research we found a number of common questions that are of concern to potential buyers. The following section addresses those questions.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a rotary hammer and a demolition hammer?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, a demolition hammer is even more powerful than a rotary hammer. It is focused on demolition and does not have a drill function.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between a rotary hammer drill and an SDS drill?</h3> <p>Largely they are the same thing. SDS describes the type of chuck. These are SDS, SDS-Plus, or SDS Max. The majority of rotary hammer drills are fitted with one of these, and a few use what’s called a spline chuck instead.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a rotary hammer drill last on average?</h3> <p>It is impossible to say how long a rotary hammer drill will last, because it is dependent on the amount of use it gets and how hard it works. For light DIY use, a rotary hammer can last many years. Used every day in a tough job site environment, then it may last perhaps 2 or 3 years.</p> <h3>Q. How do I maintain my rotary hammer drill?</h3> <p>Rotary hammer drills are rugged tools that don’t need much maintenance. Some need periodic lubrication of the hammer mechanism, though others are sealed. Those with brush motors will eventually need to have the brushes replaced. On average this is required every 7,500 hours. Check the manufacturer’s instructions for a specific tool’s maintenance requirements.</p> <h3>Q. What does SDS mean?</h3> <p>Some say SDS means Slotted Drive Shaft. However Bosch, who invented it, calls it the Slotted Drive System.</p> <h3>Q. What does 1-inch SDS mean?</h3> <p>The SDS dimension is the maximum recommended drilling diameter in concrete, though the actual maximum will depend on material. So 1-inch SDS means that the rotary hammer drill in question is capable of drilling a maximum 1-inch diameter hole. The biggest generally available is 1 9/16-inch diameter.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use an SDS drill bit in a regular drill?</h3> <p>No. A regular drill probably doesn’t have the power to use an SDS drill bit efficiently, but the main reason is that the regular chuck won’t hold them securely. Using them would be unsafe.</p>",398
1180,circular saw blade,"<p>These sections cover the important technical aspects of buying a circular saw blade, followed by a wide range of high-quality examples to choose from. Next, find answers to some of the most common questions that arise concerning the day-to-day use of circular saw blades.</p> <h3>Q. How do I change a circular saw blade?</h3> <p>First, unplug it or disconnect the battery. Find the arbor lock button to stop the blade from rotating, and press it down. Use the provided blade wrench to release the arbor nut. Lift the blade guard to remove the old blade. Place the new blade over the arbor, replace the nut, and tighten.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean a circular saw blade?</h3> <p>Unplug the saw, remove the blade, and place the blade in a bowl or tray. A variety of general-purpose cleaning solutions are available, but a 50/50 solution of water and laundry detergent is a popular choice. Remove stubborn spots with a toothbrush. Don’t use oven cleaners; they can harm tungsten carbide.</p> <h3>Q. Are circular saw blades interchangeable between brands?</h3> <p>Absolutely. If the diameter and arbor size are correct, you can use any brand you prefer.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a circular saw blade and a miter saw blade?</h3> <p>Circular saw blades are usually smaller in diameter. Most miter saw blades measure 10 to 12 inches, while circular saw blades typically measure 7¼ or 6½ inches. Miter saws are generally used for wood, plastics, and, occasionally, for nonferrous metals, but rarely for steel or masonry.</p> <h3>Q. Which saw blade makes the smoothest cut?</h3> <p>The more teeth a circular saw blade has, the smoother the cut. However, the tooth grind should be appropriate for the material you’re sawing.</p> <h3>Q. How long do circular saw blades last?</h3> <p>Blade life varies considerably because it depends on the material you’re cutting, the quality of the blade, and its frequency of use. A professional could wear out a blade in 20 or 30 hours, but an occasional DIY user might use the same one for years.</p> <h3>Q. Is it worth sharpening circular saw blades?</h3> <p>Many low-cost circular saw blades are treated as disposable, but high-quality products are worth resharpening. However, sharpening carbide blades is a specialist job, so you will need to find a local service.</p> <h3>Q. Can a 7¼-inch circular saw cut a 4×4?</h3> <p>No. Although 4×4 dimensioned lumber actually measures only 3½ by 3½ inches, a 7¼-inch saw has a maximum cut of about 2½ inches. Thus, it can cut a 2×4, but not a 4×4.</p>",419
1181,miter saw blade,"<p>The sections above contain a wealth of technical and practical information to help you decide on the best miter saw blade (or blades) for your needs. However, during our research, we found a number of questions from potential buyers that crop up quite often. You can find the answers to the most common ones below.</p> <h3>Q. How do I clean and maintain a miter saw blade?</h3> <p>Remove the blade and place it in a bowl or tray. Use a diluted all-purpose household cleaner and a cleaning pad (not a scourer). Use a toothbrush around the teeth. Work slowly so you don’t slip and cut yourself. Avoid oven cleaners; they can damage carbide tips.</p> <h3>Q. How many teeth should a miter saw blade have?</h3> <p>It depends on what you want to use it for, which is why it’s common to have several different saw blades. The article above answers this question in more detail.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use a 10-inch blade on a 12-inch miter saw?</h3> <p>If the arbor is the same size, it can be done. However, we wouldn’t recommend it. A 10-inch saw blade is usually designed to rotate faster, so the slower motor of the 12-inch saw may not power it efficiently. Also, the smaller diameter blade will descend in a different position, reducing cutting capacity.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use my miter saw to cut metal?</h3> <p>You can, but there are limits. You will certainly need a metal-cutting blade. Nonferrous blades cut aluminum, brass, and copper. Steel-cutting blades are available, but they’re not really suited to the majority of miter saws. If you need to cut steel regularly, then a dedicated metal-cutting miter saw is recommended.</p> <h3>Q. What blade should I use to cut hardwood flooring?</h3> <p>We would suggest a blade with 80 or more teeth for a smooth finish. Our top pick or a plywood blade would suit the task.</p> <h3>Q. Are more teeth on a saw blade better?</h3> <p>Not necessarily. The number of teeth affects the speed of cutting and the quality of finish as discussed above.</p>",341
1182,portable table saws,"<p>If questions remain about choosing the right portable table saw, keep reading to find answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these tools.</p> <h3>Q. Which portable table saw has the best fence?</h3> <p>All the portable table saws in this list have good fences, but DeWalt’s 10-inch table saw’s rack-and-pinion fence is both sturdy and accurate.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the lightest portable table saw?</h3> <p>At 46 pounds, the DeWalt 8¼-inch table saw is the lightest of the models available, but it’s a benchtop unit. At 51.2 pounds, the Skil 10-inch table saw is the lightest with a stand or legs.</p> <h3>Q. How dangerous are portable table saws?</h3> <p>Using a high-speed blade always presents some risk of an accident, but if operated properly with the guard in place at all times, a table saw is not a dangerous tool. Read more about how to safely use table saws here.</p>",149
1183,glue for metal,"<p>There are many technical aspects involved in gluing metal. While the sections above may have already answered many of the questions that arise, you may still have others. The following answers address the most common issues we found in our research.</p> <h3>Q. How long does it take for a glue for metal to dry?</h3> <p>Dry time depends on the type. Cyanoacrylates provide an initial bond in seconds, though they take longer to cure fully. Other products require anything from 30 minutes to 24 hours. Never make assumptions. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.</p> <h3>Q. Is metal for glue toxic?</h3> <p>Although most are nontoxic when fully cured, many are toxic while in use. They might give off harmful vapor and/or irritate skin. It’s important to read the product safety label.</p> <h3>Q. How do I glue metal to glass?</h3> <p>Either cyanoacrylates (superglues) or two-part epoxies are typically recommended. Cyanoacrylates are good for small pieces and can be less obvious than epoxy, though the latter has more strength if covering a large area is required.</p> <h3>Q. How do I glue metal to wood?</h3> <p>Several glues can be effective. Construction adhesives, cyanoacrylates, and two-part epoxies all work. It’s important to consider the environment where the glued components are used. Consider whether the adhesive needs to put up with temperature variations and whether it needs to be waterproof. The information in the article above can help.</p> <h3>Q:Does PVA stick fabric to metal?</h3> <p>No. It might provide a weak temporary hold, but PVA relies on porous surfaces for proper bonding. It will glue fabric, paper, and wood, but does not glue metal. Once again, epoxy resin is the best choice here.</p>",275
1184,drywall sanders,"<p>In the sections above, we looked at the technical aspects of the best drywall sanders and offered a selection of the top models currently available. While that information will have answered many questions, during our research we found a number of others that crop up often. Those are included below.</p> <h3>Q. Is a drywall sander worth it?</h3> <p>For small drywall repairs, a finishing sander can do a reasonable job. For large areas, particularly if involving more than one room, a drywall sander is faster, and most offer much better dust control.</p> <h3>Q. Can you use a hand sander to sand drywall?</h3> <p>You can. Any good hand sander can be used, though the job will take considerably longer, and most have no kind of dust control.</p> <h3>Q. Should I use ear protection when using drywall sanders?</h3> <p>It is advisable. Noise levels above 80 decibels (dB) may cause hearing loss, and in work situations, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) requires hearing protection for sound levels above 85 dB. Many drywall sanders are around this level, but even when quieter, prolonged exposure can be uncomfortable.</p> <h3>Q. Can drywall dust make you sick?</h3> <p>Yes. According to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), drywall dust can cause eye, nose, throat, and respiratory tract irritation. Long exposure can lead to coughing, phlegm production, and breathing difficulties similar to asthma. Using some kind of mask while sanding is absolutely vital. We recommend a half-mask respirator with replaceable filters.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best way to get rid of drywall dust?</h3> <p>Drywall dust is very fine and flies everywhere. Damping it down with a water spray helps it stick together and makes for easier cleanup. Any spray bottle that produces a reasonably fine mist will do. You don’t want to soak things; just make them damp. Next, use a soft broom to sweep up as much dust as possible. Finally, vacuum. Drywall dust can easily clog household vacuums, so a shop vac is recommended.</p>",329
1185,tool subscription boxes,"<p>If you’re wondering how much tool subscription boxes cost or how much of a commitment you have to make to this type of service, then read on for answers.</p> <h3>Q. How do tool subscription boxes work?</h3> <p>The user pays a monthly, a quarterly, or an annual subscription fee, then receives a box of typically four to seven tools on a monthly or a quarterly basis. The service includes useful tools and supplies in the box that they curate.</p> <h3>Q. How much do tool subscription boxes cost?</h3> <p>Tool subscription boxes vary in price from around $30 a month to $70 a month depending on the type and number of items included in the subscription box and the service.</p> <h3>Q. What if I want to cancel my tool subscription box?</h3> <p>Most tool subscription box services allow you to cancel at any time if you are paying a monthly subscription. If you pay for a quarterly or an annual subscription, you are locked into that time period.</p> <h3>Q. Can I pick the tools for my tool subscription box?</h3> <p>No. These tool subscription boxes curate their own items to go into each box.</p> <h3>Q. Do I get new tools in a tool subscription box?</h3> <p>Yes. All tools in the tool subscription box are new, and the box does not overlap with the same type of tools from month to month.</p>",226
1186,woodworking tools,"<p>In the article above, we have discussed some of the key aspects of the best woodworking tools and provided a selection of high-quality examples.

How many tools do I need for my woodworking projects?</h3> <p>It very much depends on the project, though many can be accomplished with fewer than you might expect. A lot can be done with just a saw, a drill, and a screwdriver. With a half dozen well-chosen woodworking tools, you can potentially make hundreds of different items.</p> <h3>Q. Do woodworking tools need to be maintained and cleaned from time to time?</h3> <p>Absolutely. Cleaning and maintaining your tools stops rust, prevents damage, makes woodworking tools and machinery more pleasant to use, and increases their working life. It is seldom hard work, and it doesn’t take very long if done regularly.</p> <h3>Q. When is the time to replace my woodworking tools?</h3> <p>When they no longer perform as originally intended; they cannot be repaired economically; and the performance is impacting accuracy, speed, ease of use or safety, it is usually time to replace the tools.</p> <h3>Q. What tools are not that essential for woodworking?</h3> <p>What’s not essential is different for every woodworker. Some will seldom use a router, while others will find it indispensable. Some will never use a hand plane. Others feel that using a hand plane is a real test of a carpenter’s skill. Focus first on the type of woodworking you want to begin with, and build a tool set that fits your needs and budget. Anything else is not essential unless your needs change.</p>",294
1187,welding gloves,"<p>If you’re wondering how TIG welding differs from MIG welding or what other dangers a welding glove will protect you from, then read on for more information about this specialty handwear.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between MIG and TIG welding gloves?</h3> <p>MIG welding gloves are thicker and provide more heat protection and coverage to suit MIG welding applications. TIG gloves, in comparison, are thinner to allow for the feel and dexterity required by TIG welding jobs.</p> <h3>Q.

1189,mig welders,"<p>This information should have answered many of the questions about MIG welder specifications and features. During our research, we came across a number of queries of a more general nature, so we have gathered those here along with their answers that should prove useful.</p> <h3>Q. What is a MIG welder best used for?</h3> <p>MIG welders are versatile tools, and they’re ideal for beginners. While they can weld a variety of metals, they work best with steel.</p> <h3>Q. What’s the difference between MIG and TIG welding?</h3> <p>Generally speaking, MIG uses a metal filler wire, which melts and becomes part of the two pieces being joined. TIG uses a non-melting electrode to fuse the two pieces directly into each other. MIG is faster, but TIG is neater.</p> <h3>Q. How do I set up a MIG welder?</h3> <p>Consider several elements, including voltage, wire-feed speed, and gas supply, if required. Actual settings vary depending on the metal being welded and the capabilities of the machine.</p> <h3>Q. Which metals can I meld with a MIG welder?</h3> <p>Some MIG welders only weld steel, but better models can weld most metals successfully. However, professionals often prefer the greater precision offered by TIG welding for so-called “exotics” like magnesium and titanium.</p> <h3>Q. What is flux-core wiring, and can my welder use it?</h3> <p>Flux-core wire creates its own shield around the weld, so you don’t need a separate gas supply. Whether your welder can use it depends on its specifications. The label should clearly state whether it’s gas, gasless (flux core), or both.</p> <h3>Q. Why should I avoid live torches?</h3> <p>Always be aware of welding safety. A live MIG torch can produce a strong electric shock, along with temperatures in excess of 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Looking at a live weld without a face mask can damage the cornea, a condition commonly known as arc eye or welder’s flash. Though usually temporary, it can painfully irritate for a day or more.</p>",321
1190,tig welders,"<p>The information above provides a comprehensive look at the many features offered by these machines and suggests the best TIG welders to suit different users or tasks.

1191,milwaukee impact drivers,"<p>This comprehensive rundown of specifications and features should make you better equipped to choose the best Milwaukee impact driver for your needs. However, a few questions may remain, and the following section tackles some of the more common queries.</p> <h3>Q. What is the torque on a Milwaukee impact driver?</h3> <p>It depends on the model. Milwaukee tools range from 450 in.lbs. on their hydraulic impact drivers up to 2,000 in.lbs. on the M18 Fuel.</p> <h3>Q. Can you adjust the torque on an impact driver?</h3> <p>Not normally. Drive speed is usually adjusted by varying the trigger pressure. However, some of Milwaukee’s best impact drivers have four modes, which offer greater control than most competitors provide.</p> <h3>Q. Do impact drivers have a clutch?</h3> <p>No. Impact drivers are designed to deliver high torque for rapid driving of large fixings. If more delicacy is required, you should use a standard drill driver, which has a clutch. The addition of a clutch also means the impact driver is considerably larger, making it difficult to access tight spaces.</p> <h3>Q. Where should you not use an impact driver?</h3> <p>The power delivered by an impact driver can damage small fixings. While plenty of control is available, it’s not really the tool for precision tasks.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use regular bits in an impact driver?</h3> <p>An impact driver has a ¼-inch hexagonal collet rather than a chuck, so it can’t use round-shank bits. Adapters are available; however, standard bits may be damaged by the extra torque, so it’s better to invest in a good set of hex impact driver bits.</p>",260
1192,dewalt drills,"<p>When shopping for a DeWalt cordless drill, choose one that meets your needs without overpaying for one that has more power than you’ll ever use. Below, learn more about the size and power you may need and other important factors to consider when shopping for one of these DeWalt tools.</p> <h3>Q. What are power drills used for?</h3> <p>Power drills are used for two main applications: drilling holes and driving in fasteners.

1193,table saws for beginners,"<p>Adding a table saw to a power tool collection opens up a whole new realm of woodcutting possibilities, mainly offering the ability to make straight lengthwise cuts (rips) on the material. Those shopping for the best saw for beginners likely will have some questions.</p> <h3>Q. How many horsepower does a 15-amp table saw have?</h3> <p>Horsepower is relative to the saw’s motor and the amount of electricity the saw draws. A 15-amp table saw that plugs into a standard 120-volt outlet can only produce a maximum of 2.4 HP, which is based on the 120-volt outlet producing 1,800 watts of electricity.</p> <h3>Q. Can I rip a 2×4 board on a table saw?</h3> <p>Yes, but use a push block to guide the wood through the blade to ensure your fingers don’t get too close to the blade.</p> <h3>Q. What should you never use a table saw for?</h3> <p>Never use a table saw to make curved cuts; table saws are designed for straight cuts only. Trying to feed the material into the blade at an angle increases the risk of the blade catching the material and sending it flying. In addition, don’t feed material into the saw from the back end, which also increases the risk of kickback. Don’t use a table saw to cut plastic, PVC, or ferrous metals—it’s not designed for that.</p> <h3>Q. Can you cut against the grain on a table saw?</h3> <p>Yes, you can make crosscuts with a table saw. For best results, use a crosscut blade.</p> <h3>Q. What are five safety rules for a table saw?</h3> <ol><li>Read the operator’s manual and familiarize yourself with the saw before making any cuts.</li><li>Wear safety glasses and hearing protection.</li><li>Use a push block to feed material through the blade rather than your fingers.</li><li>Start the blade before feeding material into it—never position the material against the blade and then turn on the power.</li><li>Always unplug the table saw before changing blades.</li></ol> <h3>Q. What are the most important features on any table saw?</h3> <p>The most critical features on a table saw are the blade, safety guard, rip fence, and miter gauge.</p> <h3>Q. How do I properly use a table saw?</h3> <p>Always study the operator’s manual and follow all safety precautions. Cut only wood or wood-fiber products and keep children, pets, and others out of the immediate area while working. Table saw injuries are high on the list of power tool injuries, but most can be avoided by following good safety techniques.</p>",405
1194,dewalt impact drivers,"<p>Understanding what jobs a DeWalt impact driver can handle is key to choosing the right model. Ahead, learn about what a DeWalt impact driver can and can’t do.</p> <h3>Q. Are DeWalt 20V batteries much more powerful than 18V models?</h3> <p>No. In fact, the batteries are identical. An 18-volt battery produces a burst of 20 volts when it first starts up before dropping into a steady stream of 18 volts. Some tool manufacturers, including DeWalt, use this 20-volt peak to label the battery, while others use 18 volts.</p> <h3>Q. Can a DeWalt impact driver remove lug nuts?</h3> <p>Yes. A DeWalt impact driver is strong enough to remove most lug nuts from cars and trucks. Most lug nuts are torqued to 100 foot-pounds, which is the same as 1,200 inch-pounds. All of DeWalt’s drivers are capable of reaching or exceeding 1,200 inch-pounds, which is why they can remove most lug nuts.</p> <h3>Q. Which is the most powerful DeWalt impact driver?</h3> <p>The DeWalt 20V MAX XR Impact Driver, which produces a max torque of 1,825 inch-pounds, is the most powerful impact driver that DeWalt produces.</p> <h3>Q. How many foot pounds of torque does a DeWalt impact driver have?</h3> <p>DeWalt’s impact drivers are rated in inch-pounds. Its most powerful impact driver produces 1,825 inch-pounds, which is equivalent to about 152 foot-pounds.</p> <h3>Q. How many pounds of torque do I need to remove lug nuts?</h3> <p>Since most lug nuts are torqued to 100 foot-pounds, which equals 1,200 inch-pounds, you need an impact driver that produces at least 1,200 inch-pounds of torque to remove lug nuts.</p> <h3>Q. Can I use an impact driver for drilling holes?</h3> <p>You can use an impact driver for drilling holes; however, they are not good at precision drilling. They should only be used to drill through material that a standard drill is not powerful enough to drill through, including metal, some masonry, and very dense or knotty wood.</p>",317
1195,welders for beginners,"<p>The information above provides a wealth of information to help beginner welders choose the right equipment, and it will have answered many of the questions that arise. However, during our research, we did find some queries of a more general nature that might benefit from further explanation. These are dealt with below.</p> <h3>Q. What is the easiest welding job?</h3> <p>The easiest type of welding for beginners to learn is MIG, and the easiest type of metal to weld is mild steel.</p> <h3>Q. Can I get shocked by a welder?</h3> <p>There is always some risk of electric shock, so it’s important to understand proper safety precautions when welding. Some welders have a “cold start,” where current doesn’t flow until the trigger is pulled; this reduces the risk considerably.</p> <h3>Q. What is the strongest type of weld?</h3> <p>TIG provides good penetration and weld consistency, so it’s arguably the strongest in terms of pure weld structure. Stick would be the better choice for welding outdoors. However, any welding process done well provides excellent strength.</p> <h3>Q. What size welder should I buy?</h3> <p>A lot depends on the thickness of metal you will weld most often, although more powerful welders will weld thicker metal. The comprehensive information above should help with your choice.</p> <h3>Q. Is arc welding stronger than MIG welding?</h3> <p>Arc welding is a general term covering all four processes discussed above. Weld strength depends on both the process and the material being welded. For example, stick welding is often considered stronger than MIG when welding very thick metal, but it could easily burn through thin metal; in that case, MIG would be stronger.</p> <h3>Q. Can I plug a welder into a regular outlet?</h3> <p>It depends on the model. Many of the best welders for beginners that we selected can plug into a regular outlet. Some welders can run off a 110-volt or a 220-volt supply, and some professional models will only run off 220 volt.</p>",322

1213,packing tape,"<p>Before you choose the best packing tape for your projects, consider the answers to the following commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q: What is the difference between packing tape and shipping tape?</h3> <p>Packing tape has a long-lasting adhesive that works in both hot and cold temperatures and works best when cartons are sealed for moves, delivery, or storage. Shipping tape manufacturers use a hot melt adhesive that makes it more durable over the short term. The adhesive is strong enough to withstand multiple touchpoints but may fail when exposed to frigid temperatures.</p> <h3>Q: Is duct tape stronger than packing tape?</h3> <p>The two types of tape have different purposes, so it is difficult to say which is stronger. Duct tape is intended to form a tight seal across air ducts and has a certain amount of built-in stretch. Packing tape is more rigid, which means that it would not stretch under the same force as duct tape. However, this same rigidity would likely prevent the packing tape from absorbing sudden force, such as if a package is dropped.</p> <h3>Q: How thick is packing tape?</h3> <p>You measure the thickness of packing tape in Mils. One Mil is equivalent to 1/1000th of an inch. On average, packing tape is between 1 to 6 Mil, though this varies by manufacturer and quality.</p> <h3>Q: What is the best tape to use on cardboard?</h3> <p>For short-term strength, such as when you mail a package, use shipping tape. However, for long-term storage, or if the cardboard is exposed to a wide range of temperatures, packing tape ensures lasting adhesion.</p>",260

From these factors, you can estimate the approximate size for the tool backpack that you’ll need to carry your tools.</p> <h3>Q. Are backpacks available that can carry a cordless drill?</h3> <p>Yes, many tool backpacks are designed with enough space to hold a cordless drill. In fact, some backpacks have an individual storage space for your drill.</p> <h3>Q. Are tool backpacks waterproof?</h3> <p>Yes, some tool backpacks are waterproof. Water-resistant materials are used in their construction, such as heavy nylon with a rubber base for the backpack to sit on. However, not all tool backpacks are waterproof or even water-resistant.</p> <h3>Q. How do you wash a tool backpack?</h3> <p>You can wash most tool backpacks in your washing machine on a “light” wash setting—of course, after you remove all the tools, fasteners, or debris from the bag! If you prefer to hand-wash it, then use a cloth, soapy water, and stain remover.</p> <h3>Q. Can a tool backpack hold a laptop?</h3> <p>It depends on the tool backpack, but yes, most tool backpacks are large enough to carry a laptop. Some tool backpacks have a specialized compartment for a laptop or a built-in charging system, so you always have power for your devices.</p>",259

Chalk lines with auto-rewind mechanisms often cost more than other models.</p> <h3>Q. Does the weather make a difference in chalk lines?</h3> <p>Yes. Rain can erase lines drawn in less durable chalk. Cold weather can make the chalk stick to the thread, which might result in less visible lines. And humidity can harden the chalk inside the box, making for an uneven distribution of it on the reel.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a chalk line?</h3> <p>Snapping a chalk line is easy. First, shake the box to properly coat the line with chalk. Secure the hook on one end of the working surface, and unwind the reel to the desired length.

Effectively, this means you’re cutting across the grain. A ripping chain is designed to cut with the grain along the length of the trunk, so it’s better when using a chainsaw mill.</p> <h3>Q: What are a chainsaw mill’s limitations?</h3> <p>Each chainsaw mill has a maximum depth of cut and a maximum width. How the mill clamps the chainsaw blade has an impact, so check the chainsaw mill’s specifications carefully.</p>",412

In professional environments, colors are often used to define particular roles (see above for more info).</p> <h3>Q. Which class of hard hats does not protect from electrical shock?</h3> <p>Class C. The C stands for “conductive,” so these hats provide impact protection only.</p> <h3>Q. How much should I pay for a hard hat?</h3> <p>It very much depends on intended use. Lightweight HDPE models can be $10 to $15, and full-brim carbon fiber models can top $150.</p> <h3>Q. When do I need to replace my hard hat?</h3> <p>Manufacturers usually recommend every 5 years, though some say as frequently as every 2 years. If cracks or dents are noticed, the hard hat should be replaced immediately. A visual inspection should be carried out every time the hard hat is about to be worn.</p> <h3>Q. Can I wear my hard hat backward?</h3> <p>Only if there is a “reverse-donning arrow” marked inside the hat, which looks like two arrows following each other in a circle. This indicates it can be worn either way. Without that mark, safety will likely be compromised if the hat is worn backward.</p> <h3>Q. Do hard hats expire?</h3> <p>There is no firm expiry limit for hard hats, but safety organizations and most manufacturers recommend that hats be replaced after a maximum of 5 years. Some of the best hard hats have the date of manufacture stamped inside.</p>",278

1247,chainsaws,"<p>Having studied the features and benefits of these tools, you may still have some more questions. The following are among those that chainsaw buyers ask most often.</p> <h3>Q: How lightweight do chainsaws come?</h3> <p>Small chainsaws can weigh anywhere between 6 and 20 pounds. The weight depends on their power source, how many batteries they use, and their construction materials.</p> <h3>Q: How do I choose a chainsaw size?</h3> <p>When it comes to the best chainsaws, a general rule of thumb is that they should be at least 2 inches longer than the thickness of the tree or limb you are trying to cut. With that in mind, when shopping for a chainsaw, consider what types of jobs for which you’ll be using the chainsaw.</p> <p>If you’re planning on using the chainsaw primarily for pruning and removing young trees, a 10- or 12-inch chainsaw should suffice. For larger jobs, consider purchasing a 16-inch or 18-inch chainsaw.</p> <h3>Q: Are electric chainsaws safer than gas chainsaws?</h3> <p>Electric chainsaws are safer than gas chainsaws due to the slower chain speeds, reducing the odds of dangerous kickbacks, and they run only while cutting. They also have shorter bars of no more than 18 inches, while some gas chainsaws have 20- or 24-inch bars.</p> <h3>Q: Can electric chainsaws cut trees?</h3> <p>While electric chainsaws are best suited for cutting limbs and pruning, larger 16-inch electric chainsaws also can handle smaller trees.</p> <h3>Q: How do I start a gas chainsaw?</h3> <p>The procedure is usually to prime the carburetor, giving a couple of gentle pulls on the cord with the motor off. Then turn it on and pull it again to fire it up. Modern gas chainsaws normally make this quick and easy. However, it’s important to read the owner’s manual. Common complaints about starting difficulties are often because the owner hasn’t checked the instructions.</p> <h3>Q: What fuel do I need for my gas chainsaw?</h3> <p>Regular unleaded gas is fine. Chainsaws aren’t particularly fussy, but premium gas is probably a bit rich. If you have a two-stroke gas chainsaw, oil must be added to the fuel before use. Check the owner’s manual for correct proportions. Four-stroke gas chainsaws contain oil in a separate reservoir.</p> <h3>Q: How do I maintain a chainsaw?</h3> <p>There are several measures you should follow to maintain a chainsaw:</p> <ul><li>Check the bar oil regularly. Lubricant is necessary to keep the chain smoothly rotating around the bar and through the wood. Nothing will thwart your chainsaw job more than a dry blade, which will cause the chain to derail, bind in the wood, or kick back.</li><li>Keep the chain sharp. A sharp chain not only improves the cutting power of the chainsaw but also prevents dangerous kickbacks.</li><li>Clean the saw blade after each use. Make sure to remove any debris or sawdust. Built-up debris can easily clog the oil hole, preventing lubricant from reaching the blade.</li><li>Tighten loose nuts, bolts, and screws. Chainsaws vibrate a lot. All of that vibration can shake fasteners loose, negatively impacting the chainsaw’s operation</li></ul>",498

Avoid operating the saw where the blade might contact soil, rock, metal, or concrete. Also use extreme caution when working near utilities like gas, electric, and waterlines.</p>",177
1251,gas hedge trimmer,"<p>If you’re wondering about how to use a gas hedge trimmer, read on for answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about these powerful landscaping tools.</p> <h3>Q. Are gas hedge trimmers more powerful than electric or battery-powered ones?</h3> <p>Most gas-powered engines are more powerful than electric motors. For hedge trimmers, this means a gas-powered trimmer can cut through larger branches and denser vegetation more quickly than electric models.</p> <h3>Q. What kind of oil do I need to use with a gas hedge trimmer?</h3> <p>Gas hedge trimmers, like gas chainsaws and line trimmers, take two-stroke (also referred to as two-cycle) engine oil. Gas hedge trimmer fuel typically consists of 3.2 ounces of two-stroke oil mixed with a gallon of gas. Check the owner’s manual for the correct fuel ratio.</p> <h3>Q. How long can a gas trimmer run on a full tank?</h3> <p>A gas trimmer can run for about an hour on a full tank of gas, depending on use. Remember that hedge trimmers with larger engines will burn through gas more quickly than those with smaller engines.</p> <h3>Q. How do I start a gas hedge trimmer?</h3> <p>To start a gas trimmer, begin by priming the bulb on the gas tank. This will pump gas into the carburetor to allow it to start more quickly. Find the choke lever and set it to “choke.” The choke limits the amount of air intake into the engine, which allows a cold engine to start more easily. Holding the hedge trimmer on the ground, pull the start cord until the engine starts. Then move the choke lever to “run.”</p> <h3>Q. How do I store a gas hedge trimmer?</h3> <p>Store the hedge trimmer in a clean, dry place that is protected from rain and moisture. If the trimmer is in storage for the season, add a fuel stabilizer to the gas tank to prevent deposits from forming in the carburetor that can prevent it from starting in the spring.</p>",325

1253,atv snow plows,"<p>If you’re wondering what size snow plow you need to clear your driveway or if your ATV is capable of pushing a plow, then read on for answers to these and other commonly asked questions.</p> <h3>Q. What size ATV do I need to plow snow?</h3> <p>A suitable ATV for a 48-inch or 60-inch snow plow would be a 500-cc quad ATV, which produces enough power to plow through snow. Large side-by-side ATVs are heavier and can therefore produce more push power in snowy conditions than standard ATVs.</p> <h3>Q. Can a 300-cc ATV plow snow?</h3> <p>Yes. However, since this smaller ATV is lighter, you might need to add weight to the back rack and potentially put chains on the tires to ensure the ATV will produce enough traction to push snow.</p> <h3>Q. How do I attach a plow to my ATV?</h3> <p>Begin by activating the float feature on the plow controller. Then line up the ATV with the snow plow and pull forward until the lower pin on the plow contacts the pin receiver on the ATV. Set the parking brake, then turn the coupler on the plow levers to the attach position. Connect the plow’s wire harness to the vehicle and push the coupler upward until it snaps into position.</p> <h3>Q. Do you need a winch for an ATV snow plow?</h3> <p>While you don’t necessarily need a winch for an ATV snow plow, using one can make adjusting the height of the plow much easier and safer than making manual height adjustments while in the field.</p> <h3>Q. Are snow plow mounts universal for ATVs?</h3> <p>Most snow plow mounts for ATVs are universal, and many manufacturers claim to be compatible with about 90 percent of ATVs. Since the claim is not a guarantee, it’s still important to determine if a snow plow is compatible with your ATV before purchasing it.</p> <h3>Q. How do you stack snow with an ATV plow?</h3> <p>It is possible to stack snow with a snow plow if you plan ahead. When plowing, make sure to push the snow well off the driveway. This will give you more room to pile on more snow as the season progresses. An ATV will not be powerful enough to move a bank of snow once the snow has frozen over.</p>",379
1254,chainsaw bar oils,"<p>After reading up on our picks of the best chainsaw oil options, you may have a few questions about using them. Read on to learn more.</p> <h3>Q.

However, there are a few cardinal rules:</p> <ul><li>Never expose the fuel source to direct heat, as it can cause the butane to explode.</li><li>Never leave an auto-start propane torch in a place that is accessible to children.</li><li>Check for leaks. Like other natural gases, butane contains a sulfur additive that has a distinct, easily detectable smell.</li><li>Wear gloves when refilling a butane torch because butane gas can cause chemical burns.</li><li>Avoid inhaling butane gas, and store canisters in a well-ventilated area.</li></ul> <h3>Q: Is a butane torch hotter than propane? </h3> <p>Butane torches reach a maximum temperature of about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, which is suitable for most welding projects. Propane is capable of reaching temperatures of around 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <h3>Q: Can I solder with a butane torch?</h3> <p>Butane torches are the preferred tools for soldering because they produce a narrow flame, which is better for the detail that soldering requires. The ability to solder with fine detail makes butane torches useful for such applications as jewelry making.</p> <h3>Q: How do you refill a butane torch?</h3> <p>Begin by making sure the burner and gas-flow control knob are both in the off position. Turn the torch upside down and locate the refill port. Shake the butane bottle to warm up the fluid. Insert the nozzle into the canister, then press and hold. The butane torch should refill in a few seconds. Remove the butane refueling canister.</p>",270
1259,sharpening stone,"<p>If you still have questions about sharpening stones and how to maintain them, read on for answers to the most commonly asked questions about these tools.</p> <h3>Q. How long do you soak a wet stone?</h3> <p>Soak your sharpening stone in water for five minutes before using it for fine stone. Ten minutes should be long enough for coarse stones to soak through thoroughly.</p> <h3>Q. How do you use a sharpening stone?</h3> <p>Begin by laying the blade across the stone at a 20- to 25-degree angle. Grasp the knife by the handle with one hand and the dull side of the blade with the other. Pull the blade toward you while making a sweeping motion across the block. Then flip the blade and make the same motion across the block in the other direction. Make ten strokes on each side, and then test the blade’s sharpness by cutting the edge of a piece of paper. Continue this process until the edge is sharp and slices through paper easily.</p> <h3>Q. How do you clean a sharpening stone?</h3> <p>It depends on the type of sharpening stone. To clean an oil stone, rub a small amount of oil in a circular motion down the stone. For water stones, use water. This will cause the stone to release the tiny metal particles you’ve sharpened off your blades from its pores. Rinse the stone with water, and wipe down with a paper towel.</p> <h3>Q. How do you flatten a sharpening stone?</h3> <p>Depending on the type of stone, wet the stone with oil or water. Use 100-grit sandpaper to remove any inconsistencies until flat. Then use 400-grit sandpaper to remove any scratches created by the coarse sandpaper. You can also purchase a flattening plate, which is designed for this purpose.</p>",293
1260,soft close cabinet hinges,"<p>If you still have questions about how soft-close hinges work or how to install them, read on for answers to these and other questions about this type of hinge.</p> <h3>Q. Can you put soft-close hinges on old cabinets?</h3> <p>Yes, it’s possible to put soft-close hinges on old cabinets. To do so, you must drill a cup 35 millimeters in diameter and 11 millimeters deep in the back of the cabinet door to mount the new soft-close hinge. The best way to accomplish this is to use a jig, such as this model from Kreg.</p> <h3>Q. How many soft-close cabinet hinges do I need per door?</h3> <p>In general, one soft-close hinge is enough to provide dampening for cabinet doors. Heavier cabinet doors may require two to handle the added weight.</p> <h3>Q. How do I adjust soft-close cabinet hinges?</h3> <p>Soft-close hinges have three points of adjustment on the hinge, each of which is changeable using a Phillips head screwdriver. The horizontal adjusting screw moves the cabinet door left to right or right to left depending on which way you turn the screw. The vertical adjuster screw moves the cabinet door up and down while the third screw moves the door closer to or further from the cabinet frame.</p> <h3>Q. What is the difference between a soft-closing and a self-closing hinge?</h3> <p>When you close a cabinet with a soft-closing hinge, the hinge catches the cabinet door a few inches before it closes so it shuts slowly. A self-closing hinge has a mechanism that snaps the door shut when it is a few inches from being completely closed.</p>",264

1264,drywall anchors,"<p>There is a lot of useful information in the article above to help consumers choose the best drywall anchors for a variety of different tasks. That said, during our research, we did come across a number of general questions that cropped up frequently. For convenience we have covered those here.</p> <h3>Q: How are drywall anchors installed?</h3> <p>How someone installs drywall anchors depends on the type. The easiest to use are known as self-drilling because they create their own hole. Others need a hole to be drilled. The drill bit for this may be provided with the fixings, but it’s not always the case.</p> <h3>Q: How much weight can drywall anchors hold?</h3> <p>The weight a drywall anchor can hold varies enormously. Lightweight plastic drywall anchors can support 10 or 15 pounds, whereas the strongest bolts can support more than 200 pounds. However, it is generally recommended that only a quarter of the maximum weight is used per anchor. Often two or more drywall anchors are used (for shelves, for example) so DIYers will want to do a little math to find a fixing with the appropriate capacity.</p> <h3>Q: Can drywall anchors be hammered in?</h3> <p>No. DIYers would either create too large a hole, thus ruining the grip, or would break the drywall. Users can give self-drilling types a light tap with a wooden or rubber mallet to get the point embedded up to where the thread starts. They can also tap in expansion-type drywall anchors, but only after the correctly sized hole has been drilled.</p> <h3>Q: How are drywall anchors removed?</h3> <p>How consumers remove drywall anchors is something else that depends on type.</p> <ul><li>Self-drilling plastic wall anchors can be screwed back out again. The neat hole is easy to fill.</li><li>Ribbed plastic anchors can be removed by inserting a screw and then using pliers to pull the combination out. Users might also use a flat-blade screwdriver for extra leverage. Bear in mind the hole can be a little ragged.</li><li>Molly bolts can sometimes be removed by inserting the bolt halfway, then tapping with a hammer to attempt to straighten out the flared part in the wall. This isn’t always successful, and it may be easier just to knock the whole fixing through into the wall cavity where it will do no harm.<br/> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2JVJE2With toggle bolts, users just back out the screw, and let the winged anchors fall inside.</li></ul>",395
