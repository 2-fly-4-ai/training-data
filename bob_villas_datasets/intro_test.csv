A dark, unmissable carpet stain can ruin the look of a lovely living space, yet the more you rub and try to remove some stains, the more noticeable they can become. Even everyday dirt tracked into the home from outside can dig in and become challenging to vanquish.

102,carpet cleaner,"<p>Carpeting can hold a whopping four times its weight in dirt and even the best vacuum can only penetrate so far, leaving all kinds of gunk and odors trapped within the fibers.

106,mop for vinyl floors,"<p>Popular budget-friendly vinyl flooring is attractive, durable, and comfortable underfoot. It’s water-resistant and holds up well to daily wear and tear, but it still requires regular care and cleaning to stay in good shape.</p> <p>The best mop for vinyl floors cleans away dust, dirt, grime, and spills while maintaining the protective finish, be it a glossy shine or flat matte. There are a variety of products available, so use this guide to pick one that suits your cleaning style and learn why the following are among the best mops for vinyl flooring.</p> <p>Vinyl floors are durable and water-resistant, so most mop types will be safe and effective to use on them. However, damp mopping is the best cleaning approach because sitting water can get into seams between the vinyl planks, which could lead to peeling and warping of the floor. Steer clear of hot steam and abrasive brushes and cleaners as well to avoid damaging adhesives or protective coatings. To choose the ideal mop for your home, consider the mop type, material, wringing mechanism, and handle design.</p> <p>Residential mops come in a range of types to suit a variety of home flooring. The most popular mop types include string, strip, flat, spray, sponge, and steam mops.</p> <p>Mop head material can affect the absorbency, texture, and cleaning power. For vinyl flooring, a gentle mop head is usually best because overly abrasive brushes or scrubbers can damage the finish. Common mop head materials include cotton, synthetics, microfiber, and sponge.</p> <p>Classic cotton, often used for traditional string mops, is highly absorbent. The strands can suck up a good amount of water, spills, and dirt from messy floors.</p> <p>Synthetic materials such as microfiber and nylon are often selected because of their absorbency and gentle scrubbing power. Synthetic mop heads often dry faster than cotton, so they are less prone to mildew and musty smells. Microfiber is a popular option because it’s durable, affordable, and easy to clean.</p> <p>Sponge mop heads are also highly absorbent, and their texture offers great scrubbing power for dirt and stuck-on messes.</p> <p>Vinyl flooring should be cleaned with a damp mop head, not a sopping-wet one. Vinyl itself is waterproof, but vinyl flooring is only water-resistant. Water damage can occur if moisture makes its way into the seams between vinyl planks. Because of this, a sturdy wringing mechanism is an important aspect of many mops to prevent oversaturating the floor.</p> <p>The mop-wringing mechanism is generally located on the mop handle or the mop bucket. Handle wringers include levers or twist mechanisms that compress the mop head to squeeze out excess water. Bucket wringers include a wringer that often needs manual pressure to force excess water from the mop head.</p> <p>There are also spin mops, which feature a convenient type of bucket wringer. Most spin mops have string or strip heads and a spinning mechanism in the bucket that quickly spins the mop head, wringing it out. The mechanism is usually controlled by a hand or foot pedal.</p> <p>Mop handles are usually made of plastic, stainless steel, aluminum, or wood. A sturdy handle will help with deep cleaning because it can take the pressure of vigorous scrubbing without bending or breaking. That’s why most high-quality mops eschew plastic handles in favor of sturdier stainless steel, aluminum, or wood.</p> <p>Plastic, however, is often used to add an ergonomic handgrip or for buttons, levers, and spray triggers. A handle with ergonomic features will be more comfortable to use. Many mops feature curved handles or soft foam grips for added comfort.</p> <p>An adjustable handle adds to the ergonomics and comfort of a mop. Stooping over while mopping can cause back pain, and a too-long handle can be difficult to control. An adjustable handle can be positioned to suit any user and minimize these concerns.</p> <p>A height-adjustable handle is a particularly useful feature for multipurpose mops. Some mops include a range of cleaning heads to double as dust mops or dusters. A telescoping handle helps tackle other household jobs such as dusting walls or ceilings. Whether for daily mopping or a deep clean, an adjustable handle makes cleaning more comfortable.</p> <p>A highly maneuverable mop makes it easy to clean every nook and cranny of a room. For thorough cleaning, consider a mop that can reach into corners and under furniture.</p> <p>Lightweight flat mops and spray mops have a thin profile that makes them easy to maneuver under furniture. Most of these mops have rotating heads that allow the user to smoothly change direction and swerve around obstacles. String, strip, and spin mops can also easily swipe across smooth vinyl floors. They often have thick fibers that can reach into corners and under cabinets and furniture.</p> <p>Electric mops are larger and heavier, and it can be difficult to get them into tight spaces. Although electric mops are the least-maneuverable option, their extra scrubbing power makes them a competitive pick for extremely dirty floors.</p> <p>Multiuse mops, extra mop heads or dust pads, and washable mop heads are common extra features. Some models use disposable mop heads for convenience, but many others have reusable, machine-washable mop heads, which makes them cost-saving and eco-friendly picks.</p> <p>Some mops can handle other household cleaning tasks such as dusting floors and even walls and ceilings. Microfiber mops are a popular pick for cleaning vinyl and other types of hard flooring. These mops can be used for both dry dusting and wet mopping floors. Combined vacuum and mopping devices offer a two-in-one clean with minimal effort.</p>",913

Or stated another way, the screw should be approximately two to three times the thickness of the thinner, upper piece.</p> <p>Steel wood screws are a good, general purpose choice for woodworking and interior DIY projects, but other types are available as well. Deck screws are wood screws that are either made of a corrosion-resistant material (like stainless steel) or are coated with a material (like silicone bronze) to make them resistant to corrosion from weather and chemicals in pressure-treated lumber. They are useful for most outdoor applications. Other wood screw materials commonly include bronze, brass, and aluminum.</p>",293

175,paint stripper,"<p>Paint prep is a necessary but sometimes tedious step. Some types of paint prep are easier than others. On a piece of furniture with only a few isolated peeling patches, you can simply scrape, sand, and prime before repainting. But if you’re tackling a project that has already been painted several times—and likely shows widespread chipping, cracking, or blistering—you’ll need to remove the existing finish entirely before pressing on with your project.</p> <p>You could do this manually with a hand sander and a whole lot of elbow grease (not an option with lead-based paint). Or you can use a paint stripper, which will take care of the task at hand in far less time and with far less effort on your part.</p> <p>Before you set out to purchase a paint stripper for your project, know that not all are suitable for all types of paint and surfaces, and some include harsh chemical ingredients that require you to take special safety precautions.

That’s why it’s important to understand how disinfectants play a vital role in the ongoing effort to keep our homes clean and germ-free. Unlike other household cleaners designed to remove grime, grease, and stains, disinfectants destroy disease-carrying pathogens (the germs that can make you sick) on site.</p> <p>Disinfectant products are available as sprays for treating large areas; liquids that can be diluted or applied directly to surfaces (via sponges, mops, and brushes); and convenient wipes for on-the-go applications.

180,broom,"<p>One of the most relied-upon household cleaning tools is also one of the simplest.

Brooms have evolved by leaps and bounds since then, but their basic purpose remains the same: to sweep up dust and debris and keep your floor surfaces clean.</p> <p>Of course, not all brooms are created equal. The effectiveness of any given broom depends on its design and construction, and whether or not it’s suitable for how you plan to use it.

184,concrete cleaner,"<p>Some cleanup chores are tougher than others—and among the most challenging are oil stains on the driveway, paint spills on the garage floor, and mildew marking the foundation. That’s because most stains on concrete are created by tough materials like petroleum products, paint, and living organisms such as mold, mildew, and algae. What’s more, concrete is porous and tends to soak up these substances, so once they penetrate deep into the surface they’re especially difficult to dislodge. Choosing the right concrete cleaning method is key—as is using the right cleaner for the job.</p> <p>The best concrete cleaners, both liquid and dry applications, attack stains deep below the surface. However, the variety of materials that cause concrete stains requires matching the cleaner to the type of stain.

187,brass cleaner,"<p>The look and durability of brass has made it popular for generations. It’s in everything from jewelry and ornaments to bathroom fixtures.

360,sous vide machine,"<p>Sous vide, translated to English, means ‘under vacuum.’ This sounds complicated, but is actually a new and largely hands-off way of cooking meat, eggs, fish, vegetables, and more. The food is sealed inside a ziploc or vacuum-seal bag and immersed in a pot of water. The sous vide coil and pump are placed in the water and attached to the pot, then turned on, where they circulate the water using convection currents or a pump.</p> <p>The sous vide coil and pump heat the water to maintain a consistent and even temperature as the food cooks. This reduces the likelihood of hot and cold spots in the cooking water and reduces mess: when the food is finished cooking, remove it from the water, cut off the bag, and serve. The result is evenly cooked meat with a tender consistency, well-poached eggs, and vegetables that are tender-crisp with all of the nutrients still inside instead of rinsed away—sous vide is a healthy way to cook that doesn’t require constant attention.</p> <p>Sous vide machines vary across the market, with different temperature ranges and noise levels to consider. You may be interested in a machine with additional features such as a timer and wi-fi programming, so you can control the temperature and time with your smartphone. Keep your budget in mind, as well as the size that is best suited for your cooking tasks and available storage space.</p>",234

As indicated by their name, saucepans are often used to cook sauces, though they have a range of other applications like boiling rice and vegetables, sauteing, making puddings, soups, and more.</p> <p>Good quality saucepans are durable, heat quickly and evenly, and cool rapidly. These pans are made of a number of different materials, the most common being durable stainless steel or aluminum for even heating, and ceramic models are also available. Many of these saucepans have firmly riveted handles for added stability and don’t transfer heat to the cook’s hands, as well as a lid for simmering and steaming. The best saucepan for your kitchen depends on your preferred material, the range of recipes you cook, and what quantities you plan on cooking with.

470,bread boxes,"<p>While bread cannot be preserved indefinitely, a bread box is an effective method for extending shelf life and quality. Placing baked goods from the oven or bread maker in the fridge is a common mistake: counter to popular belief, lower temperatures actually make them go stale faster.

Today’s juicers provide the opportunity to enjoy the natural flavors of your favorite fruits without the distraction of artificial sweeteners and additives that are included in prepackaged juices.</p> <p>While most blenders can turn chunks of fruit into fruit juice, a juicer is different.

484,kitchen towels,"<p>Paper towels are among the most frequently used paper goods in North America. The Norwex Movement (an initiative led by the “green” cleaner manufacturer of the same name) estimates that 51,000 trees are cut down daily to sustain Americans’ paper towel consumption—even with plenty of sustainable alternatives at many people’s fingertips. Switching from traditional one-time-use rolls to reusable paper towels can not only save trees but can also help conserve water, as manufacturing paper towels tends to be a water-intensive process.</p> <p>When choosing the best kitchen towels, consider natural resources needed for materials as well as style and durability.

485,vegetable peeler,"<p>The vegetable peeler is a staple in the home kitchen. This simple but useful tool makes preparing veggies quick and easy.

On a Y-peeler, the blade is perpendicular to the handle. There is no better choice between the two styles—what’s best depends entirely on your preference.</p> <p>Vegetable peelers come in a range of designs and materials. The most popular blade materials include stainless steel, carbon steel, and ceramic. Stainless steel is durable, less prone to rust, and is usually dishwasher-safe. Carbon steel can stay sharp for longer than stainless steel, but is more prone to rusting. Ceramic is lightweight, rust-resistant, and sharp, but it is more fragile and likely to chip.</p> <p>Peelers’ handles are typically made of plastic, wood, or stainless steel and sometimes have ergonomic rubber grips. A rubber grip can prevent the peeler from slipping and cutting you. When shopping for a vegetable peeler for your kitchen, one of the most important things to think about is whether the handle is comfortable to hold. You might also consider whether the peeler is made of dishwasher-safe materials, has extra safety features, and can be used on a variety of vegetables.</p>",217

491,beverage fridge,"<p>Standard kitchen refrigerators are great for storing perishable foods and even a small number of canned beverages, but often the bulk of the space in a regular fridge is taken up with fresh veggies, leftovers, and drinks such as milk and OJ, leaving little room for canned beverages. Worse yet, pouring a drink over ice waters down the taste, leaving it cold but diluted and unsatisfying. The solution is a beverage fridge that’s dedicated solely to chilling canned and bottled drinks.</p> <p>The best beverage fridge for you will depend on the space available, how many drinks the cooler should hold, and whether it’s a freestanding, built-in, or portable model.

591,masticating juicer,"<p>Also known as slow juicers or cold press juicers, masticating juicers are a popular tool for making fresh, nutrient-rich fruit and vegetable juice. Traditional juicers, sometimes referred to as centrifugal juicers, use high-speed blades and operate at 1,200 revolutions per minute (RPM) to extract juice from fruit and vegetables. This process produces heat, which may negatively affect temperature-sensitive nutrients. Masticating juicers use a rotating auger and operate at slower speeds of 60 to 100 RPM.

594,turkey fryer,"<p>While the smell of roasting turkey wafting through a home can be wonderful to many, deep frying a turkey or any other whole bird like a goose, chicken, or duck brings new and delicious flavors to the table. Many cooks avoid this method, however, because it requires intimidating-looking special equipment—and because immersing such a heavy bird in gallons of hot oil can be kind of dangerous.</p> <p>Turkey fryer fires and explosions—which can be seen on the internet—usually result from user error and beginner misunderstandings. Frying a turkey outdoors over a propane flame requires placing the frame and burner on a very smooth surface. Grass and soil can be unstable and are not good options because if there is any imbalance, the stockpot of boiling oil can unexpectedly tip when the weight of a bird is added. When we tested those styles, we placed them on the concrete deck near our pool, given the stability of that area (not because of the proximity to the water).</p> <p>Electric and infrared (oilless) styles also need a level playing field to keep the cooking even, because they also use propane to fuel them and/or oil for cooking. Through our testing, we discovered that they’re a better option on patios or driveways built with pavers or bricks. If they’re indoor styles, they can be safely used on a counter in a well-ventilated space. Because of the setup, before deciding on the kind of turkey fryer to buy, consider where it will be used.</p> <p>The type of food and quantity also has an effect on which fryer is best. While they’re billed as turkey fryers, any bird can cook in these babies, ranging from Cornish game hens and quail to ducks and geese. Plus, the biggest fryers can handle whopping 25-pound Thanksgiving birds. We tested several different kinds of poultry beyond just turkey, including game hens, chickens, and duck, and had delicious results with crisp skin and succulent flesh each time.</p> <p>Turkey fryers aren’t limited to cooking just the fowl category, either. Depending on their size, many of these appliances can handle side dishes as well as holiday hams and briskets, game-day pulled pork shoulder, and pretty much any other cut of meat. In one of the smaller pots, we made sweet potato fries that turned out amazing.</p> <p>Finding the best turkey fryer can be a challenge, but learning how to find and purchase the best turkey fryer for you and your family can help. Below are important features to consider and hands-on reviews of some of the best turkey fryers on the market organized by category.</p>",431

597,wireless meat thermometer,"<p>Just about any meat thermometer can help a chef determine when a steak, turkey, or roast is ready—without committing the culinary sin of cutting into the meat to check the internal temperature—but wireless meat thermometers take this ability to the next level.</p> <p>Wireless meat thermometers use a transmitter that can connect up to six probes. These probes can monitor the internal temperature of an oven, the temperature of the meat, or multiple types of meat all at once. The transmitter then sends this information to either a remote control or a smart device, allowing the chef to carefully monitor the temperature of the main course even from as far as 500 feet away. These devices also feature programmable alerts to let the user know when the meat is ready.</p> <p>This guide explains the most crucial features to consider when shopping for the best wireless meat thermometer and reviews some of the top models on the market, so you can make an informed purchasing decision.</p>",164

603,dishwasher brands,"<p>While dishwashers aren’t strictly a necessity in a kitchen, many homes include these helpful appliances. Instead of standing over the sink to scrub dishes clean, then drying them by hand or leaving them in a rack to air dry, a dishwasher streamlines the process so users only need to place dishes into the pull-out racks, add detergent, and choose a wash cycle.

607,vacuum sealers,"<p>A vacuum sealer removes most of the air from food packaging to extend the food’s shelf life while preventing freezer burn.

668,squirrel trap,"<p>People and squirrels usually live in peace, with squirrels minding their business in the trees while we go about the daily grind in our homes. But on occasion, squirrels might take an interest in your home, chewing through its insulation, electrical wiring, PVC pipes, and even the wood framing. Using a squirrel deterrent is one solution, but sometimes, you may need to resort to more extreme measures and remove the squirrel with a squirrel trap.</p> <p>Squirrel traps are available as humane versions that consist of a wire cage with a spring-loaded door that snaps shut when the squirrel enters.

670,artificial grass for dogs,"<p>While a beautiful natural lawn is certainly a wonderful asset to a home, it’s not easy to attain. Lawns require constant mowing during the growing season, regular weed treatments year-round, and annual overseeding to stay lush. Even after all that work, dogs can quickly ruin a perfect yard with their grass-killing urine and damaging digging.</p> <p>For those who don’t want to spend hours and hundreds of dollars trying to achieve the perfect natural lawn, an artificial lawn is an alternative. Artificial lawns stay green year round and can stand up to a dog’s abuse. They drain well and have antimicrobial treatments that prevent pet waste odors from lingering. They’re also low-maintenance, requiring no regular chemical treatments.</p> <p>Keep reading to find out more about the factors to consider when shopping for artificial grass, and check out the following list with some of the top artificial turf for dogs on the market.</p>",150
671,grass seed for shade,"<p>If the lawn in a sunny front yard is thriving but no grass seems to grow under the large shade tree, odds are it’s because the grass isn’t suitable for a shady spot. Most grasses are sun-oriented plants that develop to their maximum potential only when they receive 8 or more hours of direct sunlight per day. Fortunately, a few types of grass seed germinate and grow in medium to light shade, and a few more can survive even in dense shade.</p> <p>Be aware, however, that even grass designed to grow in dense shade still requires at least 2 hours of direct sunlight or up to 6 hours of filtered light every day, such as dappled light through tree leaves. Ahead, learn what to look for when choosing the best grass seed for shade and find out why the following types of grass seed are suitable for various shady situations.</p>",150
672,inflatable water slides,"<p>Those dog days of summer can make it hard to get kids away from their screens and into the great outdoors. A backyard water slide could lure them away from their devices. Inflatable slides amp up the standard backyard kiddie pool or slip and slide to create a backyard water park complete with 5-foot slides, integrated water guns, bounce houses, and splash pools.</p> <p>The massive inflatables can cover a 15-foot by 20-foot space, reach heights of up to 10 feet, and accommodate up to five kids at a time.

674,skunk repellents,"<p>Although skunks may be a less common nuisance to homeowners than other pests, when they do come calling, they bring with them a unique threat—the ability to spray a foul-smelling liquid that’s detectable up to 3 miles away. In addition to engulfing one’s home in a cloud of stink, skunks can also build nests in crawl spaces and under decks, causing structural damage.</p> <p>Fortunately there are ways to get rid of skunks without having to engage them directly. Some repellents use natural chemicals, such as essential oils and predator urine, to ward away skunks. There are also electric repellents that can scare them away with ultrasonic frequencies.</p> <p>Ahead, find out what to look for when shopping for the best skunk repellent, learn about the different types of skunk repellents, and find out why the products below are some of the best skunk repellents on the market.</p>",146
675,lawn fungicides,"<p>Even the best-tended lawn can develop a fungal problem, which can show up as visible brown patches, rusty-looking or yellow spots, rings of dead grass, and slimy areas. Fungi and their spores occur naturally outdoors and are found virtually everywhere, but they rarely wreak havoc with lawns unless they start reproducing rapidly. Certain situations, such as living in a humid region or experiencing a rainy season, can increase the risk of a fungal infestation in a lawn. Other potential causes include overfertilizing, overwatering, growing turfgrass that’s poorly suited to the area, or mowing the grass too short.</p> <p>Today’s best lawn fungicide options are made with biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms that kill parasitic fungi and/or their spores; for the most part, they will not affect weeds or desirable plants (though there are exceptions). Some products are formulated to stop an active fungal infestation, while others may be preventive to keep a healthy lawn looking great. Many fungicides also work to eradicate fungus on trees, shrubs, and ornamental plants, although, depending on the formulation, some may injure specific types of plants or trees. Ahead, learn about the different types of fungicides and find out why the following products are among the best antifungal options for keeping grass healthy and free from imperfections.</p>",212
676,fences for dogs,"<p>For many pet parents, a dog fence is an absolute necessity. Whether you want to keep your furry friends safe in your own yard or prevent them from getting into trouble in the kitchen, a good fence is key to maintaining peace of mind.

677,invisible dog fence,"<p>Installing a traditional fence may help to keep your pup within your yard, but the thought of them wandering around your neighborhood may call for more diligent measures. Luckily, there’s another option: the invisible dog fence.</p> <p>Attractive alternatives to privacy fences, dog houses, or dog pens, invisible dog fences interact with a special collar and fencing system to keep your canine in your yard. The collar vibrates as your dog approaches the boundary, and then gives an electrical correction when the pup has gone too far. Invisible fences do this while maintaining an open backyard with a clear view.</p> <p>Keep reading to learn about some of the best invisible dog fence systems and more on this humane containment method. Each of the top picks below was selected after an in-depth review of the market and thorough product vetting.</p>",138

680,gas grills under 300,"<p>A gas grill is essential to complete any outdoor living space, but these outdoor cooking appliances don’t come cheap. A good gas grill can approach $1,000 or more, making adding one to the patio or deck a considerable investment. Luckily, there are plenty of quality gas grills for under $300. And while they may lack the aesthetics and the bells and whistles of higher-end models, they offer surprisingly similar performance. Grills at this price point range from large four-burner models to small portable gas grills for tailgating and camping. Ahead, learn about what factors one should consider when shopping for the best gas grills under $300 and find out why the models below are some of the best options on the market.</p>",122
681,deck cleaner,"<p>Outdoor decks are favorite spots for entertaining and relaxing, but like all exterior surfaces, they eventually get dirty. Left that way, they can become dingy and drab before their time. To keep your deck looking great, it’s recommended to clean it annually—ideally in spring or early summer—and then follow up with a sealer for extra protection from the elements. But with dozens of deck cleaning products available, choosing the best one can be a challenge.</p> <p>That’s why I set out to personally put a host of popular products through their paces. I selected the top-selling deck cleaners on the market and used each one to tackle actual decking boards that had been stained with dried-on mud and grease splatters from the grill. To my surprise, some products that I expected to do well failed to earn a space in this lineup. Keep reading to learn more about selecting the best deck cleaner for your needs, and find out how the following products performed in my tough deck cleaner tests.</p> <p><strong>ALSO TESTED</strong>: Mold Armor and Citra-Shield</p>",175
682,grill cleaner,"<p>When sunny skies and warm weather call for cookouts, your grill can quickly get gunked up with grease, fat, sauce, and rust, giving food an unappealing taste or even causing problems in your intestinal tract. Save your stomach the trouble and invest in a grill cleaner that removes rust and baked-on food residue from the grill grate, side burner, hood, and exterior.<br/> While most grill chefs will have one or two grill brushes that can quickly clean off most fat or sticky globs of sauce, the best grill cleaner can remove even the most cooked-on grease from your grill grate.</p> <p>Unfortunately, some grill cleaners leave behind their own residue that makes users cautious about using them. Others have unpleasant odors. And many just don’t work well, requiring you to scrub just as hard with a grill brush.</p> <p>We tested these grill cleaners in real-life situations after cooking a variety of proteins and plant-based dishes. In addition to simply cooking, we deliberately made some messes. We splashed around extra marinade on grill grates to get a nice sticky char. We melted cheese and caramelized sugar in grill baskets to leave crusty coatings. We grilled fat by itself to generously coat drip pans. And we casually flung barbecue sauces, oils, honeys, mustards, ketchup, and other condiments on grill exteriors, the inside of hoods, and side burners. In short, we made it as challenging as possible for any heavy-duty cleaner.</p> <p>Where appropriate, we also tried these cleaners on grill accessories like kabob skewers and fish baskets, other outdoor appliances like turkey fryers and smokers, and indoor appliances such as microwaves and ovens. We also tested them on stainless steel surfaces, ceramics, porcelain, and other materials when the makers indicated it was safe to do so.<br/> These grill cleaners below have been proven effective against this stuck-on grease and baked-on food residue, making them among the best on the market and essential for keeping a grill clean.</p>",323
683,pool supplies,"<p>A backyard pool can be an invaluable asset, providing much-needed relief during those scorching months, but not if the water is murky and green algae is growing on the walls. Keeping a well-maintained pool is key to enjoying clear and inviting water all through the summer, but doing so requires the right tools.</p> <p>Pool skimmers, brushes, and vacuums can take care of leaves and debris, while the right chemicals can keep bacteria and algae at bay. This guide will examine what pool supplies are essential to keeping the water crystal clear through those dog days of summer and list some of the best pool supplies to consider.</p>",107
684,pool algaecides,"<p>Backyard pools are a great place to exercise, relax, and have fun with family and friends. However, algae can get in the way of that fun. Some types of algae are simply an annoyance, while others can cause rashes, illness, or even worse.</p> <p>If algae is a problem in your pool, algaecides are among the best algae removers for pools. They can kill algae, and some types also can prevent algae growth. To help maintain proper water balance and safety, an algaecide is typically used alongside shock treatments, chlorine, and other pool chemicals.</p> <p>Pool algaecides can break up, suspend, and kill different types of algae to keep pool water clean and usable. The best pool algaecide helps keep your pool clean and ready for a quick swim. However, the pool type, the type of algae that’s present, and the other chemicals and products that are used in the pool all help determine the type of algaecide that works best.</p> <p>Keep reading to find out what to consider when choosing the best pool algaecide, and check out some of the top options on the market.</p>",184
685,suction pool cleaners,"<p>Although it is possible to use a brush and manual vacuum to clean your pool, it’s not a task many pool owners have the time or desire to complete, especially given that a pool should be cleaned at least twice a week during the in-season.</p> <p>A good suction pool cleaner makes pool maintenance easier by automating the cleaning process. This type of pool cleaner attaches to the pool skimmer via a 30- to 40-foot hose. It automatically moves around the pool bottom and walls, removing sediment, small leaves, and other debris, which is then sent to the pool filter and pump skimmer basket. Read on to learn what features one should consider in this type of pool cleaner, and find out why the models below are some of the best suction pool cleaners on the market.</p>",136
686,gardening gloves,"<p>Behind every beautiful, bountiful garden is a great deal of dirty work. Fortunately, a pair of rugged, reliable gloves makes yard tasks faster, safer, and more manageable. Whether you’re planting seeds, pruning thorny bushes, pulling stubborn weeds, or spreading chemicals, such as herbicides, pesticides, or synthetic fertilizers, gardening gloves may make these tasks simpler, cleaner, and more pleasant.</p> <p>Gardening gloves of all sizes and styles line the shelves of garden centers, and they are widely available online—but how much do they actually help? We wanted to know the real benefit of the most popular gardening gloves, and the only way to find out was to personally test each pair. We got them wet, dug with them, pulled weeds, and truly gave them a proper workout.</p> <p>Not all gardening gloves are alike—some are designed to provide a nonslip grip on tools, while others serve to protect fingers and hands from poking thorns and wires. Still others feature clawlike fingertips that allow the user to dig without the benefit of a hand trowel. Keep reading to learn what to look for when shopping for the best gardening gloves, and check out how each of the following pairs earned a spot in this lineup.</p>",201
687,gardening tools,"<p>From perennial flower beds to privacy hedges, backyard landscapes require regular upkeep.

An in-depth review of the market and thorough product vetting went into assembling the list of top picks.</p>",99
688,wheelbarrow,"<p>If you spend a good amount of time gardening or landscaping, a dependable and capable wheelbarrow can help lessen your load. While these humble helpers may look pretty similar to one another, they’re not all designed to accomplish the same tasks.</p> <p>The best wheelbarrow for hauling relatively lightweight twigs and fallen leaves may not stand up to the strain of concrete-mixing in its tub. We put these carts through the paces during 2 days of yard work to see just how worthy they are. If you’re in the market for one, read on to learn what to look for when shopping, and find out how these wheelbarrows performed for real yard and garden tasks.</p>",114
689,weed killer,"<p>Whether they crop up on your lawn, in a flower bed, or along a fence, weeds are the gardener’s age-old enemy. They make your yard unsightly and your walkway unkempt, and they compete with neighboring plants for sunlight, water, and nutrients, which can weaken your cherished plants. Weed species can even spread and disrupt natural habitats. Worst of all, weeds just seem to keep coming back no matter what you do.</p> <p>Read on to learn what to look for in a weed killer and find out why the ones below are our top picks among the best weed killer options available.</p>",101
690,weeding tool,"<p>Herbicides control weeds, but they pose serious health risks to humans and wildlife. Manual weeding, on the other hand, gets the job done without harm to you or the environment. With a well-made weeding tool and some vigilance, you can control weeds.</p> <p>Weeds proliferate seemingly overnight, and it’s easiest to remove them when they’re young.</p> <p>Some weeds, like dandelions, develop a single taproot that grows deeper into the soil as the plant matures. The longer the taproot, the more difficult it becomes to eradicate. Though some weeds release without a fight, others will have you wondering if a jackhammer would be more appropriate. Just keep in mind, with all weed removal, timing and soil conditions matter. After a rainfall, soil is softer and more willing to release roots.</p> <p>Consider these recommendations for the best weeding tool and the following tips for selecting one that suits your needs.</p>",147
691,raised garden bed,"<p>Raised-bed gardening is a popular option for many backyards. It allows users to put a garden practically anywhere, even if the yard isn’t suitable for installing a traditional ground-level garden. Raised beds are touted as back savers since they reduce the distance the gardener needs to bend to tend to the plants. But how helpful are they, really? Without personally testing the beds, we couldn’t tell whether they contained quality materials, were designed for optimal plant growth, or if they would be overly challenging to assemble.</p> <p>So, we decided to test them. We assembled nearly a dozen raised garden beds (no, they don’t come assembled), and then we put them through a battery of gardening-specific tests. Unfortunately, not all the raised garden beds survived our stringent testing; you can find out about one that didn’t make it just ahead.</p> <p>In general, we discovered that raised beds offer several advantages. They provide better drainage than ground-level gardening. They also are less prone to soil compaction, but this depends on the soil mix used to fill the raised bed.</p> <p>Since every garden can be different, there is no “standard” when it comes to raised garden beds. Picking the best raised garden bed will depend on space limitations, physical comfort, design, and the type of plants grown. Keep reading to learn how to pick the best raised garden bed for your backyard, and find out why the following models all earned a spot in this lineup of some of the best raised garden beds for backyard plants.</p>",254

694,hose nozzle,"<p>Using your thumb to direct the flow on an open-ended garden hose is hardly an effective way to water plants. A good hose nozzle provides superior control and helps prevent the wasteful overwatering that can harm plants. However, with so many options out there, it can be challenging to decide which hose nozzle to choose. We wanted to know whether today’s top-rated nozzles are all they’re cracked up to be, so we tried them out.</p> <p>We attached the nozzles to garden hoses and cranked up the water pressure, noting how easily they connected, whether they dribbled (no one likes that!), and how well each of the spray functions performed. We watered grass, potted plants, and raised beds in our quest to determine which nozzles would earn a spot in this lineup of the best hose nozzles.</p> <p>Keep reading to learn some essential tips for choosing the best hose nozzle, and find out the best (and worst) aspects of each of the following products before selecting the right one for your yard and garden this year.</p>",175
695,watering can,"<p>Whether your green thumb involves caring for houseplants or young seedlings that prefer not to be drowned by a blast from a garden hose, it’s important to deliver the right amount of water. A watering can helps make it easier to adjust the amount of water delivered, and it’s a handy way to carry water to indoor plants and outdoor containers that require regular watering.</p> <p>A suitable watering can will have the right capacity, construction, weight, and water delivery system to make caring for your plants as easy and comfortable as possible.</p> <p>Read on for tips on choosing the best watering can for your home, and to find out why these models are some of the best on the market.</p>",120
696,pruning shears,"<p>Keeping a garden and landscape in top shape requires care and maintenance, including regular pruning. Whether you need to trim back dense branches or gather herbs for dinner, the job will be faster and more efficient with a good pair of pruning shears.</p> <p>Though they resemble household scissors, hand pruners are made to cut through stems, shrubs, and branches instead of paper and fabric. We tested the following pruning shears in our backyard landscape to find out how each would perform in real-life gardening situations. Later in the article, read our reviews to learn why we consider the top selections to be the best pruning shears in each category. But first we share the shopping criteria we used to narrow down our list.</p>",123
697,landscape fabric,"<p>Whether we like it or not, weeds are part of every landscape, competing with your trees, shrubs, and flowers for vital nutrients. Landscape fabric could be your golden ticket to a weed-free landscape.</p> <p>By acting as a physical barrier between the soil and the sun, landscape fabric prevents seeds from seeing the light of day, while still allowing air and water to penetrate to the roots of the plants you do want. Here are some important features to consider when selecting the best landscape fabric, as well as our top weed barrier picks for your landscape.</p>",96
698,compact greenhouse,"<p>Extend your vegetable harvest into fall or get a jump on spring planting with a compact greenhouse. The protective environment in a greenhouse shields tender plants from temperature swings, harmful pests, and high winds while offering diffused sunlight for optimum plant growth.</p> <p>You don’t need a large backyard to take advantage of the benefits a greenhouse offers; don’t let the small size of these compact greenhouses fool you. Each one offers plenty of protection for seedlings and tender plants. We’ve rounded up some of the best compact greenhouse options that won’t take up too much room but offer the benefits of a larger structure.</p>",104
699,pots for succulents,"<p>Succulents store water in their leaves, making them drought-friendly and low-maintenance houseplants for those who work odd hours, frequently travel, or have little interest in fussing. You can still bring home a colorful cactus or a vibrant Crown of Thorns only to find the plants change color, get mushy, and die. Although it’s true that succulents are generally easy plants to maintain, they certainly need some care.</p> <p>To keep your succulents healthy and growing, start with choosing the right pot for each individual plant. That doesn’t just mean a pot that adds visual interest to your home, though you likely want that, too. The best pots for succulents must have proper drainage and just enough space for the plants to grow. When you take the time to choose the correct planter using these shopping tips and recommendations, your succulents can lead long, fruitful lives.</p>",144
700,snake repellent,"<p>Some people handle sudden and unexpected encounters with serpents surprisingly well, while others not so much. Most human snakebites happen when people tamper with snakes to move them. No matter the case, a snake repellent can help.</p> <p>Snake repellents, combined with proper landscape maintenance, help people and snakes avoid unwanted encounters. Repellents use scent or sound to create an uncomfortable environment for snakes. But not all snake repellents are equal or provide the same results. If you’re looking to avoid snake encounters this season, read our suggestions to find the best snake repellent for your lawns or garden.</p>",98
701,insecticide for vegetable gardens,"<p>Insects are part of a healthy garden ecosystem. Bees and other pollinators ensure a plentiful harvest from herb and veggie gardens and fruit trees, while ladybugs and praying mantises help control plant-damaging pests. When fruit worms, aphids, Japanese beetles, roaches, and their destructive ilk gain a toehold in a garden, they can quickly ruin your crops. A targeted insecticide can help prevent this.</p> <p>The best insecticides for pest control in vegetable gardens are fast and effective at killing destructive bugs without harming their beneficial brethren—or pets and humans. They’re even better when they’re easy to apply without specialized equipment.

702,fertilizer for tomatoes,"<p>Sweet, juicy homegrown tomatoes are the epitome of backyard garden produce, and they don’t happen by accident. It takes a healthy combination of diligence, patience, sunshine, and soil fertility to grow tomatoes successfully.

703,fertilizer spreader,"<p>Whether seeding a new lawn, feeding an existing garden, or treating a yard for bug infestations, a fertilizer spreader is an invaluable tool. Sure, seeds and fertilizer can be spread by hand, but it takes longer, produces inconsistent results, and it puts the user in contact with potentially dangerous chemicals.</p> <p>A fertilizer spreader may be used to apply any lawn treatment, including grass seed, lime, insecticide, fungicide, and of course, fertilizer. These machines apply products evenly so that the entire yard can be treated, resulting in less product waste and less time and effort. A fertilizer spreader may also be used in the off-season to spread salt on icy walkways and paths.</p> <p>We researched and tested some of the highest-rated fertilizer spreaders available. Just ahead, our results and the shopping considerations we’ve outlined will help narrow the field and help you find the right kind of spreader.</p>",147
704,hummingbird feeders,"<p>Hummingbirds add a fun, sometimes comical element to a landscape with their high-speed aerial acrobatics. And because bird-watching can be a peaceful pastime, it’s no wonder that feeding hummingbirds is immensely popular. But if you want to attract hummingbirds, you’ll need to use a hummingbird feeder that works.</p> <p>Hummingbird feeders come in all shapes and sizes, and it can be challenging to know which one is the best. Since hummingbirds are highly mobile, curious birds, a suitable hummingbird feeder should be attractive and functional.

The best mosquito repellent can come in many different forms, like lotion, wipes, spray, or even technology that is designed to </span><span>repel mosquitoes</span><span> from a given area, instead of applying repellent to your body. </span></p> <p><span>You also can choose all-natural, child-safe, and even sunscreen-infused mosquito repellents to keep your skin safe from harmful UV rays and insect bites alike. The products below consider these and other factors when recommending mosquito repellent according to type, efficacy, and overall quality.</span></p>",92
707,potting soil,"<p>Unlike soil amendments that mix into natural soil for gardening, potting soil is an all-in-one mixture for container plantings that contains everything potted plants need to thrive. It’s an essential ingredient for indoor and outdoor container gardening with two major roles: to store and release water and nutrients that plants use; and to provide a stable base for plants to structurally anchor themselves. As an anchoring system, the soil must have a porous structure that allows the roots to penetrate deeply. As a moisture reservoir, it balances water-holding capacity and drainage, so the roots remain damp but not soggy.</p> <p>Potting soil (also called “potting mix”) ingredients are similar among all types and brands, but not all potting soils are the same. Companies formulate specific ingredient proportions for different growing conditions and plant types. Additives like fertilizer make big differences in overall performance.

720,humidifier for plants,"<p>Indoor plants offer an aesthetic appeal, plus they remove allergens from the air and oxygenate the space. The key to keeping your indoor plants thriving all year round is maintaining humidity levels that are specific to the plant types. And often, simply watering your plants isn’t enough to keep moisture levels optimal.

Moreover, they are good for starting seeds indoors to transplant outside later. Grow bags also make a good alternative for gardeners who live in areas with poor soil quality. These garden helpers are planting pots made of fabric. Gardening in these “pots” minimizes the need to weed or use gardening tools.</p> <p>Grow bags can be used to cultivate herbs, fruits, vegetables, and flowers.

727,weed torch,"<p>Weed management is rarely at the top of anyone’s list of desirable to-dos. Bending over and pulling weeds is a lot of work, and it’s rarely a permanent solution.

728,organic fertilizer,"<p>All plants need nourishment. In nature, plants cooperate with microorganisms like fungi and bacteria to scavenge nutrients from a variety of sources, including the organic and mineral content of the soil and gases in the atmosphere. Under cultivation, these systems are not as robust. Domestic plants, from lawn grass to houseplants, need a little help to grow their best. That’s where fertilizer comes in.</p> <p>Organic fertilizers stimulate and support the natural processes plants use to feed themselves.

732,fertilizer for peppers,"<p>Few things are as satisfying as growing vegetables and picking them at their ripest, healthiest, and tastiest. As vegetable plants grow, their roots extend deep into the soil, absorbing the nutrients necessary for vegetable production.</p> <p>While most soil types—except heavy clay—are suitable for growing vegetables, the soil should drain well and carry plenty of nutrients. By adding a fertilizer designed to produce vigorous plants, plentiful blossoms, and large specimens, gardeners can maximize their vegetable harvest.</p> <p>The best fertilizer for peppers and other veggies will vary depending on the current soil conditions, garden location (ground level, raised bed, or container-grown), and how much time the gardener has to tend the plants.

733,rooting hormone,"<p>Gardeners use multiple methods for growing new plants, including starting them from seeds, bulbs, and rhizomes. However, when the goal is to produce a plant identical to an existing plant, taking a cutting is usually the simplest way. A cutting is a 4- to 8-inch section of stem taken from a healthy plant and then put in water or a growing medium to root.

Even those who aren’t familiar with advanced gardening concepts and are just trying to clone a favorite plant from a planter can often be successful with cuttings.</p> <p>Cuttings from some plants, such as ivy and Dieffenbachia, root easily in plain water. Others need a little encouragement, and that’s where rooting hormone comes in. Rooting hormones are chemicals that stimulate the growth of new roots on cuttings.

736,citrus fertilizer,"<p>Like other fruit trees, citrus trees thrive when they have the nutrients they need to develop healthy root systems, strong trunks, and branches. The healthier the tree, the more large, delicious fruits it produces. Trees absorb many of the nutrients they need through their roots, but not all soil is ideal for fruit production. That’s where citrus fertilizers come in—they provide an optimal blend of nutrients citrus trees need to flourish.</p> <p>The best citrus fertilizer for one tree grower is not necessarily the best one for another. Factors such as current soil quality, the tree’s specific needs, and the type of fertilizer all play a role in determining the best choice for your situation.

737,brush killer,"<p>Depending on which area of the country you call home, a variety of brushwood species could be waiting to spread along your fence lines or grow into impassable thickets in your yard. Left to their own devices, brush—a combination of saplings, conifers, young trees, and invasive vines—can quickly encroach on little-used parts of the yard until you can ignore it no longer. Trying to chop and dig the weeds out is a labor-intensive task, and many brush varieties will regrow if any of the roots are still in place.</p> <p>That’s where brush killers come in.

These lights can also range in brightness from just 10 lumens, which is about as bright as a cell phone flashlight, to over 200 lumens.

Take a look at the products below for help in finding the best solar post cap lights for your home.</p>",173

741,pond pump,"<p>Moving water is enchanting. Any backyard pond helps create a calming atmosphere and adds visual value to the landscape, but when water bubbles, trickles, or emits a spray that captures a rainbow prism of hues, the effect can be nothing short of magical. While attractive, nonmoving water is likely to stagnate, adding a pump to recirculate the water in a backyard pond or create a fountain helps keep the water fresh and free of mosquitoes.</p> <p>The best pond pump varies by the type of water feature and the desired effect.

744,fertilizers for hydrangeas,"<p>A perennial favorite in the landscape, hydrangea is hardy in a wide range of growing zones and is a relatively easy keeper. While hydrangeas vary in form, color, and bloom time, they are known for the large flower heads that cover the plants—so large, in fact, the blooms often weigh down the stems.

746,greenhouse plastic,"<p>Abundant light is essential for healthy plant growth. While some greenhouse gardeners are fortunate enough to have greenhouse walls made from glass panels, the vast majority of greenhouses feature either rigid plastic panels or plastic sheeting. Compared to glass, plastic is inexpensive, lighter in weight, and, simply put, using plastic to build a greenhouse is easier. The greenhouse offers growers a chance to save money by raising seedlings to later transplant to the garden or provides a spot where tropical plants can survive cold seasons while still receiving ample light.

Most of these situations can be a nuisance when you bring out your equipment again the following season—an expensive nuisance if it means a trip to a small engine shop for repairs.</p> <p>Adding a fuel stabilizer to a gasoline storage tank can circumvent these problems. It’ll keep gas fresh and gunk-free and also help retain the fuel’s ignition vapors, necessary for easy starting. Let those vapors dissipate and you’ll be yanking the pull-start in frustration. Pour one of the best fuel stabilizers directly into the tank of your ride-on mower, tractor, or a fuel jug that you store for your snowblower.</p> <p>Though fuel stabilizer formulas can be a bit complicated, mixing needn’t be a challenge. Most manufacturer directions will call for 1 ounce of stabilizer per a certain number of gallons of gas: this is the stabilizer-to-fuel ratio.

A stump killer, which is an herbicide specially designed to kill a stump and its roots. Stump killers eliminate the need to chop or dig up stubborn stumps, and they prevent new shoots from forming. Read on for tips on how to choose the best stump killer for your yard and find out why the following products are among the best options for getting rid of troublesome stumps.</p>",166

919,room humidifier,"<p>Heating and air conditioning strip your home’s air of its natural humidity.

Then, use one of these powerful units to eliminate wrinkles in minutes.</p>",139
924,dryer,"<p>Purchasing a new dryer can be an overwhelming prospect. While all dryers serve the same purpose—drying your clothes using hot air—they vary in how well they accomplish that task. Some of the best dryers come with a dozen or more drying cycles and up to four different temperatures, allowing you to skillfully dry many different fabrics. Others include sensors that can determine the optimal time and temperature to dry your clothes without causing shrinkage or fading.

925,dryer vent,"<p>Replacing an old dryer vent may not be high on your list of home repairs, but it’s an issue you shouldn’t ignore. A failing dryer vent will hurt your dryer’s efficiency at best and, at worst, cause it to overheat and become a fire hazard. Because dryer vents are recesses between your home’s interior and exterior, they can potentially allow animals, insects, and cold air inside.</p> <p>These devices vent the hot, humid air generated by your clothes dryer through a hose and out to the exterior of your house. Dryer vents and hoses are made of durable, flame-retardant materials that can stand up to the intense heat created by your dryer.

928,quiet fan,"<p>Strategically placed fans help reduce home energy costs as they circulate air to assist overworked air conditioning systems. Alternatively, fans provide a cooling function when air conditioning is not available. Fans do not actually cool the air in your home. Instead, they create airflow that moves across your skin to generate a cooling sensation due to moisture evaporation and body heat dissipation.</p> <p>The best quiet fan for a peaceful night’s sleep cools bedroom occupants while maintaining a serene environment for uninterrupted slumber. In our guide below, discover essential considerations and product recommendations for high-quality, quiet fans that transform a bedroom into a relaxing haven for comfortable snoozing.</p>",107
929,evaporative air cooler,"<p>Evaporative air coolers are a type of air conditioner that employs evaporation. A fan inside the machine pulls hot, dry air in through a wet media pad. The hot air quickly warms the top layer of moisture on the pad, causing the water to evaporate and dropping the temperature within the air cooler by up to 20 degrees. This cool, moist air is then expelled from the unit by the same fan that draws the hot, dry air in, creating a constant airflow through the wet pad and into the immediate area.</p> <p>These devices don’t consume as much energy as a traditional air conditioner because they only operate a fan. The water for the pad is provided by an internal tank that needs to be refilled when the level gets too low to properly cool the air. If an evaporative air cooler seems like a smart, money-saving solution for your home, read on for important shopping considerations and to check out some of the best models on the market.</p>",169
930,humidifier for large room,"<p>A humidifier adds moisture to a home’s dry air. While a small humidifier is ideal for bedrooms and nurseries, big rooms may need a larger humidifier.

This guide offers tips and identifies the options to consider when shopping for the best humidifier for a large room.</p>",98
931,places to buy a washer and dryer,"<p>Regularly doing laundry is a big part of being an involved, contributing member of society. You can only wear dirty, stained, and sweaty clothes for so long before people start to take notice, take offense, and then become concerned about your health—and possibly their own. So, when the washer or dryer breaks down (or you’re just ready to upgrade), it’s important to be able to replace them quickly and reliably.</p> <p>However, not every big-box store carries washers and dryers, and those that do may not have high-quality options. Instead of defaulting to the first available set you find, take some time to check these common retailers to find the best place to buy a washer and dryer.</p>",117
932,standby generator,"<p>The purpose of a generator is to provide power to appliances, electronic devices, and lighting in remote locations, like campsites or in an RV, but when the power goes out at home, a portable generator isn’t going to have the necessary output to supply the entire house. If power outages are a regular occurrence or they are a significant concern for you and your family, then consider investing in a standby generator.</p> <p>These large devices become semipermanent fixtures in your home with a line that runs directly to the electrical system, ensuring that when the power goes out, the standby generator will automatically start up and get your power back on within minutes.

933,air conditioner brands,"<p>A failing air conditioner in the blistering summer heat isn’t something one can wait to replace. While there are plenty of options to choose from, knowing which brands are the best choices can be a confusing process. Selecting an air conditioner from one of the well-known top AC manufacturers is a great choice for those who can afford it, but not everyone can.

934,personal air conditioner,"<p>Air conditioners can be bulky energy hogs, with even the smallest versions weighing upward of 50 pounds. Taking them on the road is inconvenient to impossible. While there’s no replacement for a good air-conditioning unit, there is a chance for some relief from the heat with a personal air conditioner.</p> <p>These small devices, which weigh around a pound, lack the powerful refrigerant other air conditioners use to cool air. However, they can create a cool mist by using ice water instead to offer some relief on a scorching summer day.</p> <p>In addition to using far less power than a standard air conditioner—many can run for hours on a rechargeable battery alone—they’re much smaller and portable. These personal cooling machines can make ideal companions for camping trips, a day at the beach, and other outdoor excursions.</p> <p>This guide will delve into the world of personal air conditioners to cover how they work and the features that are important to look for in the best personal air conditioner.</p>",166
935,energy efficient air conditioners,"<p>Air conditioners are essential on those hot and humid summer days, but that relief can come at a price. An AC can quickly drive up a utility bill. The average window air conditioner uses 900 watts of energy per hour, while a central air conditioning unit can use upward of 3,000 watts per hour on hot days. At the average utility rate of 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, a central AC unit can add as much as $90 to your monthly utility bill.</p> <p>Fortunately, there are energy-efficient models that can slash those utility expenses.

936,portable air purifiers,"<p>Portable air purifiers filter out pollutants and allergens like their larger counterparts. However, they’re so small that you can carry them from room to room, use them in the car, or even wear them. Portable purifiers often have different filter types to target specific particulates.</p> <p>Depending on the filter and portable air purifier design, the air purifier can filter allergens, odors, or air pollutants. Many models contain a combination of filters to remove more than one type of air particulate. Once the filter has trapped and removed the contaminants, the air purifier recirculates clean air into the breathable air space. Take a look at some of the most important portable air purifier features in our shopping guide, along with the best portable air purifiers on our list.</p>",127
937,stick vacuums,"<p>Thanks to its smaller motor, a stick vacuum is thinner and far more lightweight than its upright and canister cousins.

941,stain remover,"<p>Stain removers and laundry detergent aren’t the same thing, although they work hand in hand. The best laundry detergents remove dirt and odors and the occasional light to moderate stain. Stain removers, on the other hand, pack a more concentrated punch and are typically applied directly to the problem area.</p> <p>Although most people can live with a light stain or two on the garments in their wardrobe, what happens when you get ketchup on your favorite white shirt? Running it through the wash alone won’t solve the issue, and dry-cleaning or replacing the shirt entirely are options that are often out of budget.

950,creosote remover,"<p>Creosote is a by-product of burning wood, coal, pellets, or oil, which create gases as they burn. These gases rise through the chimney, coating the inside of the chimney liner as they do. Today’s fireplaces are designed to allow maximum airflow, which reduces the problem of creosote buildup, but still, this design doesn’t completely eliminate the issue.

Floating shelves require wall-mounted installation and come in various sizes, materials, and designs. They can be invisible, fitted into corners, hold picture frames, or be used for bathroom storage.

An invisible floating shelf can make a stack of books look like an intriguing sculpture. A floating shelf used as a spice rack can make spices more accessible while also adding visual interest to a kitchen.

1162,wardrobe,"<p>Years ago, homes were built with closets as an afterthought, if they existed at all. The solution to housing clothes, shoes, and other apparel fell to the clothing wardrobe. Sometimes known as an armoire or chifforobe, the wardrobe was often a stately piece of furniture, made of sturdy wood and designed to last a lifetime. In fact, there are many antique wardrobes passed down through generations today.</p> <p>When choosing the best closet systems, there are numerous options for the modern shopper. Many wardrobes are still constructed with sturdy wood; but while some have ornate or elaborate designs, there are also minimalist options that provide smooth, sleek lines for bedroom storage.

1167,locks for storage units,"<p>In just the past 5 years, more than 250 million square feet of self-storage space has been built in the U.S. Suffice it to say that more and more people are turning to self-storage to hold their belongings. And while storage units might be a great solution for reducing clutter in the home, they require a good lock to ensure those belongings stay secure. Though many storage unit facilities require tenants to use a cylinder lock that the company provides, some leave it up to their tenants to provide their own lock. If you have your own backyard unit, you also want a secure lock handy. Finding the right padlock for the job is not an easy task.

1174,stud finders,"<p>If you’ve ever had to install shelving or hang a mirror, you’ve more than likely had to find out where the studs were located behind the drywall. That’s because attaching anything heavy to drywall itself could eventually lead to the item crashing to the floor. Drywall is not strong enough to hold considerable weight, so to hang hefty items, it’s best to drive nails or screws into the studs that run up and down behind the drywall. There are a few tricks for locating wall studs, but these methods are not foolproof. Generally, it’s quicker and more reliable to use a tool specially designed for the purpose—a stud finder.</p> <p>A wide variety of stud finders are on the market, and we decided to test a slew of them to help readers find one that suits their needs. I tested magnetic and electronic models in my quest to find the best stud finder options out there. Which one is right for you will depend on the type of projects you tackle.

1175,caulking gun,"<p>Caulking guns are designed for one thing: to deliver a continuous bead of caulk in order to seal joints between two surfaces like gaps between window frames and jambs. The majority of the caulking guns used today are manual, meaning you squeeze a hand trigger to dispense the sealant. Others are powered caulking guns and are the new kids on the block. They are growing in popularity because all you need to do is guide the tip of the gun to create a smooth, continuous bead of caulk.</p> <p>The right caulking gun depends on the type of caulk that will be applied, as well as the overall scope of the project and budget.

1176,axe for splitting wood,"<p>The enjoyment from the glowing ambiance of a wood-burning fireplace is priceless to many, but buying firewood has a cost. It can run as much as $400 per cord (a measurement of 4-feet by 4-feet by 8-feet or 128 cubic feet), depending on where you live. You may be able to avoid this cost if you’re lucky enough to have access to a stand of oak, maple, or ash trees, and know-how to harvest and split your own firewood. Still, you need to know how to select the right tool for the job.</p> <p>Axes can be, and most often are job-specific in nature. Some of the best axes are very specific for certain jobs, while a few offer multiple uses. In order to help narrow the field to the best for specific tasks, we evaluated many and the axes on our list went through rigorous testing. We used them to split rounds of cedar and cottonwood trees. Many of these axes function as multipurpose tools, so we tried splitting, making kindling (small shards of wood used to start a fire), pruning, and general clearing as well.</p> <p>More than one person tested these axes. We had a 5-foot-11-inch and a 5-foot-4-inch tester take a swing with these axes since handle length and weight influence effectiveness and ease of use based on the user’s height. During testing, we noted the blade’s sharpness, weight, the axe’s overall balance, and the material quality, too. These were all taken into account in accordance with the axe’s designed purpose. We made sure to note that in our testing and evaluations.</p> <p>If you aim to split your own firewood, keep reading to learn what to look for in an axe. You’ll also find out why we’ve chosen the following axes (and hatchets) as some of the best for most DIY lumberjacks.</p>",304
1177,multimeter,"<p>From testing batteries to determining the amount of voltage in an electrical circuit, the multimeter is a standard diagnostic tool often found in electricians’ tool kits. But multimeters also come in handy for DIYers who want to test their home’s wiring or repair electrical appliances. They’re also practical for hobbyists—folks who like to tinker with electronic circuits in the building of things like pedometers, motors, and humidity sensors.</p> <p>Prior to the development of multimeters (also called multitesters), individual meters were necessary to test circuits for voltage (voltmeter), resistance (ohmmeter), and current (ammeter). Today’s multimeters combine those testing capabilities into a single tool, letting you perform a variety of electrical tests with one device.</p> <p>A wide variety of multimeters are available, designed for both basic and advanced circuit testing and geared toward different projects or specialties. While a DIYer can usually get by with a no-frills tool, electricians and HVAC pros will benefit from some of the advanced options found on professional models.</p> <p>We performed hands-on testing with some of the best multimeters, so keep reading to learn about what we found.</p> <p><strong>Also Tested:</strong></p>",183
1178,tape measures,"<p>The “measure twice, cut once” adage is the key to success in all kinds of craft and construction projects.

We personally tested the best tape measures on the market to see if they lived up to their manufacturer claims.

1179,snow shovel,"<p>Removing snow from your driveway the old-fashioned way might not be fun, but it’s a good-for-the-earth way to clean up those wintry messes. Not all methods of ice and snow removal are quite so eco-friendly as using a snow shovel.</p> <p>Recent studies have shown that chloride contamination due to salt treatments is toxic for wildlife, agriculture, and people—long after the snow has melted. Shoveling snow by hand causes no harm to the environment—and heck, it’s great exercise. Plus, thanks to the high-quality, well-designed snow shovels of today, driveways and paths are cleared quicker than ever, and more safely, too, so users can avoid being among the more than 11,500 people injured shoveling snow every year.</p> <p>We carefully researched top snow shovel models and then tested them on a driveway (75′ x 8.5′), a deck (12′ x 8′), and a walkway (150′) with about 4-5 inches of snow. For the driveway, we drove a vehicle over to pack down the snow. Read on to see how each performed and to understand the features that make for a good snow shovel.</p>",179

1181,ice scraper,"<p>Removing frost and ice from your windshield or driveway is a straightforward task. Just grab an ice scraper and get to work, right? Well, not all scrapers offer the same results.

1182,impact driver,"<p>If you plan to tackle jobs involving larger or longer screws and fixings—like those used for decking or framing up a house—you’ll want to add an impact driver to your tool collection. They are specifically designed for heavy-duty screw-driving tasks, where an ordinary drill driver would struggle.</p> <p>In the past few years, more impact drivers have appeared on the market than ever before. I wanted to know which ones were worth the money—and which ones were basically duds—so I personally tested the most popular sellers, and I didn’t go easy on them.</p> <p>The best impact driver for your individual needs should pack enough power to handle the types of projects you plan to tackle. Read on to learn about how these souped-up screwdrivers differ from regular drills and which ones performed the best (and the worst) in my hands-on tests.</p>",140
1183,wood filler,"<p>Cracks, divots, holes, or rot can crop up on wooden surfaces due to ordinary wear and tear, accidents, and during DIY projects.

1185,extension cord,"<p>A length of insulated wire with a plug at one end and a socket at the other, an extension cord comes in handy to connect an appliance, a power tool, or another electrical device to a power source beyond the reach of the item’s own cord. Yet helpful as they are, extension cords can be dangerous.</p> <p>According to the Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI) about 3,300 home fires are started annually by extension cords, killing or injuring hundreds of people each year. These fires occur because of overheated wires, which happens when too much electrical current passes through wires that are inadequate for the job.</p> <p>Replacing old extension cords can keep a home and its occupants safe. Read on for tips on selecting the best extension cord (or multiple cords) for indoor and outdoor use, and see why the following options are winners in their categories.</p>",146
1186,screwdriver set,"<p>Screwdrivers are simple, slender hand tools that, with a few forceful twists, push screws into surfaces to fasten materials together (and, with the reverse action, remove screws).</p> <p>Basic as they are, screwdrivers are not a one-size-fits-all tool. Nor does one type of screwdriver fit all situations. If you’ve only got one or two screwdrivers at your disposal, you may be out of luck if they don’t match the screws that come with your new bookshelf or kids’ playhouse kit.</p> <p>That’s why screwdriver sets are so handy. A good-quality screwdriver set comes with all the screw heads you need to tackle many different repairs and projects, from tightening up a loose door handle to assembling a piece of flat-pack furniture.</p> <p>To learn more about screwdriver sets, their key features, and what to look for when shopping for the best screwdriver set, keep reading below.

1187,miter saw,"<p>Today’s miter saws are a significant improvement over the manual miter boxes of the 1960s. For anyone who does any type of carpentry work, a miter saw usually becomes essential. Mitering is the process of fitting two boards together at an angle, and with trim work requiring so many of these cuts, miter saws are sometimes called “trim saws.” Still, they’re invaluable for making other types of crosscuts as well, such as end cuts on hardwood flooring strips or angle cuts on roof rafters.</p> <p>Selecting the best miter saw depends on the type of projects a woodworker or carpenter does.

1188,circular saw,"<p><div><noscript></noscript></div></p> <p>The words “versatile” and “tool” are combined so often these days that it’s hard to tell if it’s the truth or just an easy marketing ploy. But a quick tour of a professional construction site will certainly prove that a circular saw—a handheld electric saw that uses a round spinning blade to cut materials—is the real deal when it comes to versatility.</p> <p>A good home workshop also warrants a reliable, powerful saw that can make short work of a variety of tasks, from breaking down a sheet of plywood to making quick, repetitive cuts on a stack of framing lumber. Circular saws, when set up correctly, can even cut grooves and dadoes.</p> <p>Almost every power tool company sells a circular saw, so choosing the right power tools for a workshop can be challenging. Whether you’re a DIYer seeking a lightweight battery-powered option or a pro in the market for the most reliable, feature-loaded model, this guide will help shoppers get a handle on what to look for among the best circular saw options.</p> <p><div><noscript></noscript></div></p>",175
1189,palm sander,"<p>The finishing touches on a woodworking project can transform decent work into stunning craftsmanship. Using just the right sanding and finishing techniques can make all the difference. For this reason, some DIYers spend hours slowly sanding down wood projects by hand to achieve the perfect finish—a method that is time-consuming and tiring.</p> <p>Whether the type of sander needed is a sheet sander or a random orbit sander, investing in the right kind of palm sander for your woodworking needs can help save both arm fatigue and time. Just attach a sandpaper to the bottom of a palm sander and the foot of the sander will vibrate rapidly in tiny orbits to efficiently sand down wood to a consistent finish, doing most of the work for the DIYer. Sanding can also open up the grain on a piece of wood so it accepts a finish coat more evenly.</p> <p>Purchasing a high-quality palm sander is key to getting the woodworking results you want to achieve. We’ve researched and field-tested some of the most popular palm sanders on the market and narrowed the list to the following top-rated models in their individual categories.</p>",190
1190,staple gun,"<p>The best staple gun could be just what you need for jobs where a nail gun would be overkill. Staples can penetrate and fasten weaker materials like plywood, sheathing, screen, or fabric without tearing it apart. Whether you’re hanging outdoor holiday decorations, installing house wrap, laying carpet, or mounting delicate moldings, a staple gun can be indispensable for plenty of projects.</p> <p>To help you choose the best staple gun, we performed hands-on testing with several models. We found the DEWALT DWHTTR350 Heavy-Duty Aluminum Stapler/Brad Nailer to be the best choice overall, with the Bostitch 18-Gauge Crown Stapler being a handy choice for finish work and light-duty projects. Here’s our official ranking:</p>",111
1191,ratchet,"<p>If you’ll be doing repairs around the house or on your car, you’re likely going to need a ratchet—a wrench with a fastener component used to tighten or loosen nuts and bolts. A ratchet has a rotating gear inside its head and two levers (known as pawls) that catch the gear’s teeth. One pawl, when engaged, tightens the nut or bolt, while the other pawl is used to loosen a fastener, as the user turns the handle.</p> <p>Basic as these hand tools may be, they’re definitely not one size fits all, so a DIYer will want to reach for the ratchet (aka socket wrench) most appropriate for the task at hand. Plus, as any professional builder or mechanic will tell you, there’s a big difference between a high-end ratchet and a low-quality model. This shopping guide will give you the lowdown on these essential tools and detail why the models here are our top favorites among the best ratchet tools available.</p>",161
1192,mechanic tool set,"<p>A basic tool kit with the DIY essentials—a hammer, screwdriver, and measuring tape—can see you through any number of straightforward household projects. But when you’re undertaking more complex jobs, such as automotive work, you most likely need a solid mechanics tool kit. These sets typically include more than 100 different tools, including wrenches, screwdrivers, sockets, extension bars, and ratchets.</p> <p>If one tool in a poorly-made kit can break easily, then 100 can as well. Investing in the best mechanic tool set with components of high-quality chrome vanadium or stainless steel will save you a lot of frustration. Whether you’re working on the car or around the home, this selection of auto mechanics tool sets can point you in the right direction to durable options.</p>",124
1193,home air compressor,"<p>An air compressor pulls air from the surrounding environment and jams it into its storage tank. It stores the air under pressure until it’s released through a pneumatic tool—like a nail gun or paint sprayer—in powerful bursts or a steady stream.</p> <p>Air compressors can range from small, portable models—great for inflating sports equipment, bike tires, or car tires—to large 60-gallon tanks for continuous air pressure for spray-painting projects. For the best home air compressor for large projects, check out our top picks in their respective categories.</p>",86
1194,miter saw stand,"<p>Miter saws are designed for making simple, accurate, quick cuts in trim, lumber, and some other materials. But use one without a proper stand—like on the ground or on a regular table—and some of that simplicity, accuracy, and speed can go by the wayside. The best miter saw stands do away with this compromise, giving the user something to quickly attach a saw to at a comfortable height.</p> <p>With so many miter saw stands on the market, though, which is the best? We performed hands-on testing with the following miter saw stands to see which ones came out on top. Keep reading to find out what we learned.</p> <p><strong>ALSO TESTED:</strong></p>",110
1195,ladder,"<p>In any home, you eventually have to change the light bulbs, hang art, and keep the gutters clean. The right ladder means you won’t have to borrow one from a neighbor or use a piece of furniture (not a good idea, safety-wise).</p> <p>But you don’t want to go for the first ladder you see. You might end up with one that’s too short, can’t support your weight (and that of your tools), or isn’t up to the task at hand. Use the guidelines below to navigate the most important considerations and choose the best ladder for your needs.</p>",98
1196,moisture meter,"<p>Moisture meters can test the moisture content of many different materials, including drywall, paneling, and wood studs. Furniture makers and other woodworkers use them frequently to ensure they’re working with a quality product, and flooring contractors use the meters to determine ideal moisture conditions when installing a laminate or wood floor over a concrete slab or subfloor.</p> <p>For home and building inspectors, a moisture detector is necessary for verifying the condition of a home. Similarly, you can use this tool to verify that your home is moisture-free or ensure the quality of materials during DIY projects. A moisture meter can help you determine if there is too much moisture or your home needs a dehumidifier.</p> <p>This guide features hands-on testing of the top-rated moisture meter options available. Some passed with flying colors, while others didn’t make the cut.</p>",138
1197,level,"<p>In almost any home renovation, achieving the best results requires some type of level. Whether you’re trying to hang cabinets or determine how sloped the floor is, having the best level on hand is key to a successful project.</p> <p>Some projects won’t work well if they’re out of level or plumb (the vertical term for level). For instance: Hanging a new door in a rough opening. If the door jamb isn’t plumb, the door won’t shut correctly, or at all in some cases. Consider building a DIY workbench: If it’s not level, screws and tools may roll off the sides—a real nuisance and hindrance to your workflow.</p> <p>Whether you’re building a deck, trimming table legs, or painting stripes on an accent wall, starting with a level reference is the only way to achieve consistent and accurate results. There’s a perfect tool for each of these scenarios, and this guide will help you choose the best level for your project.</p>",159
1198,soldering station,"<p>Fixing electronics—such as a television, computer board, or even a drone—can be intimidating. But a reliable soldering station makes successful home electronics repair possible.</p> <p>With a soldering station, you can adhere computer chips, wires, resistors, and transistors together. Small enough to sit on a desktop, soldering stations pack enough power to melt away thick layers of solder. Just set the tip’s temperature to suit your precise needs. Available in several different styles, the following soldering stations rank among the best in their categories.</p> <p>Note: Soldering irons are not designed for home electrical wiring repairs. These tools are for electronics only.</p>",100
1199,framing hammer,"<p>A standard household hammer—weighing an average of 12 to 15 ounces—is indispensable for simple tasks like tapping a nail into a wall to hang a piece of artwork. But it’s not the best choice for erecting the skeletal structure of a home, garage, or other building—a task known as “framing.” When it comes to assembling wall studs, floor joists, and rafters, reach for a framing hammer.</p> <p>These specialized tools look like traditional hammers for the most part, although the claw in back is straighter and elongated as opposed to curved. But the biggest difference is in weight. In many cases, a framing hammer is literally a heavy hitter, weighing more than a household hammer—up to 2 pounds more, in fact. This extra weight provides the power needed to drive the long nails used in framing.</p> <p>We wanted to know more about the top contenders in the framing hammer market, so we tested them. We drove large framing nails while noting handle vibration, grip comfort, and overall balance. We pulled out nails using the hammers’ pry bar-like claws and even used the claws for a bit of demolition work. We rated each hammer’s performance in multiple categories to give our readers a good idea of the pros and cons of each model.</p> <p>Whether you’re a carpenter or a DIYer, if you’re going to frame a building, you’ll want a hammer designed for the job. Keep reading to learn what to look for when shopping for the best framing hammer and find out how the following hammers earned a spot on this lineup.</p>",261
1200,winter work gloves,"<p>Work doesn’t stop just because the temperature drops, but getting jobs done in the cold can be downright painful without the right pair of gloves. Frigid tools and stiff fingers won’t be a problem thanks to the insulated layers, waterproof coating, and improved dexterity found in the best winter work gloves. So keep your digits toasty and tackle those projects with these great gloves:</p>",64
1201,power tool set,"<p>When you find yourself in need of some new power tools, consider buying an entire corded or cordless tool combo kit. Not only will this save you money, but you’ll also get needed tools from quality power tool brands that you might not have otherwise considered.</p> <p>Most power tool sets come with a drill driver, reciprocating saw or circular saw, a flashlight, and even an impact driver. You should also consider how the tools are powered. Some of the best power tool sets come with at least one battery to share among the tools; others may have more, and some have none.</p> <p>That leaves you to find and purchase your own battery before you can use your new cordless tools. Read on to find the best power tool set for your workshop.</p>",132
1202,respirator,"<p>Some DIY activities can send irritating particles or vapors into the air. Having to work around airborne particulates is annoying, but sometimes it’s even unsafe. According to the New York State Department of Health, some particularly noxious vapors can make their way into your bloodstream via your lungs and poison you. Activities like sanding, welding, painting, or even repairs can decrease your workshop’s air quality, possibly putting your health at risk.</p> <p>Instead of allowing harmful airborne irritants to make their way into your mouth, nose, throat, or lungs, you should use a respirator and other protective gear. Respirators fit over your nose and mouth to form an air filter to reduce the number of particles and vapors you inhale. The best respirator for your project will vary, but this guide will help you choose one for your workshop needs.</p>",139
1203,small flashlight,"<p>If you’ve ever struggled to find your keys or fumbled with them in a lock, then you likely understand the importance of having a small flashlight on hand. A smartphone flashlight can be a quick fix in a hurry, but phone flashlights can only produce 20 to 100 lumens. In comparison, the average small flashlight is capable of 500 to 1,000 lumens, illuminating an entire area instead of just a tiny bubble of light.</p> <p>The best small flashlight has a compact but durable frame that you can conveniently carry in a pocket or a bag. Extra features like a belt clip, carabiner, or water-resistant casing may be necessary additions to a quality flashlight if you plan to use it for physically challenging activities, like hiking, boating, climbing, or camping. Read on to learn what to look for in a small flashlight and why these recommendations rate as some of the best in their respective categories.</p>",155
1204,whittling knife,"<p>Whittling is similar to wood carving in that they both form wood into a new, creative shape. However, wood carving uses chisels and gouges, and might rely on power tools to carve the wood, while whittlers perform their craft solely with a piece of wood and a knife. The simplicity of this hobby allows just about anyone to start whittling with little to no experience. Just pick up a relatively inexpensive whittling knife and a piece of wood and get started.</p> <p>A new whittling knife is always an exciting addition for new and experienced craftsmen alike. You get to try out the cut of a new blade and the grip of the handle. Ideally, the best whittling knife will sit comfortably in your hand and have a curve to the blade to enhance your whittling ability. Though some whittling knives are designed for a special purpose, like a scorp for concave whittling of a wooden spoon, most knives have a generalized shape that handles a variety of whittling ventures.</p> <p>Product efficacy and overall quality join comfort as key shopping considerations. The products below are recommended to help you find the best whittling knife to enjoy your hobby.</p>",197
1205,rubber mallet,"<p>Rubber mallets are excellent additions to many toolboxes. They give you the ability to adequately address specific tasks, like banging out dents in metal, hammering wooden dowels, or nudging flooring tiles into place. Think of a rubber mallet as a padded hammer. Avoid using this type of hammer on metal nails because it will damage the mallet’s soft rubber head. A rubber mallet comes in handy when you need a little extra force, but you don’t want to damage ceramic flooring, tiles, or other fragile materials. When you shop, consider the size and weight of the mallet you plan to swing and choose one according to the task. If you aren’t certain how you will use this tool, find an average-sized mallet, around 16 ounces.</p> <p>The best rubber mallet for you will also have an appropriate head, grip, and handle material. The head of a rubber mallet can be made entirely of the same soft rubber, but it may have a soft rubber on one side and hard rubber on the other. Manufacturers typically make mallet handles from wood, steel, or fiberglass, with fiberglass having the edge on weight and vibration absorption. The type of grip it has is a personal choice. Some people prefer a smooth grip on their mallet, while others want a rubberized grip to absorb any residual impact force that reverberates through the handle.</p>",228
1206,pocket hole jig,"<p>More than just challenging, wood joinery requires a degree of expertise that practically rises to the level of art form. Besides precision and patience, most types of joinery call for expensive tools. There is an exception: pocket hole jigs.</p> <p>These handy tools make joinery easy and affordable. Even a newbie DIY woodworker can create professional-looking joints without investing hundreds of dollars in tools. Ranging from basic jigs for casual DIYers, to large bench-mounted jigs for experienced woodworkers, to power jigs for professional workshops, the following picks rank as some of the top pocket hole jigs you can buy.</p>",98
1207,corded drill,"<p>Despite the advancements in cordless drill battery technology, the best ones aren’t powerful enough to do the job. Drilling 1/2-inch holes in hardwood, burrowing through steel: those feats require the power of a corded drill.</p> <p>While the top cordless drill maxes out at 300 watts and requires a periodic battery charge, the best corded drill will produce nearly 900 watts, generating significantly more torque. The best corded drill is a useful tool for home projects and an essential in the workshop. Below, you’ll discover why these picks are some of the best on the market.</p>",95
1208,right angle clamp,"<p>When it comes to woodworking, it can be frustrating to hold two pieces of wood together at a 90-degree angle to join them. It’s a process that could benefit from an extra set of hands. A corner clamp, or right-angle clamp, is a better option for these projects.</p> <p>A right-angle clamp consists of an L-shaped arbor that pushes against an L-shaped frame via a handle that attaches to a spindle. The vise holds two pieces of wood at a 90-degree angle with the ends perfectly aligned, which frees your hands to join the two pieces together either with glue or fasteners.</p> <p>This guide will review the top picks for some of the best right angle clamp for DIY projects.</p>",119
1209,reciprocating saw,"<p>Also known as a “recip saw,” a “saber saw,” and a “Sawzall,” the hand-held reciprocating saw is the tool of choice for demolition work. Reciprocating saws cut through a variety of materials, including wood and metal. .</p> <p>The best reciprocating saw depends on the type of material you need to cut, how often you intend to use it, and, most importantly, the quality of the product you choose. Read on to find out what to look for when shopping for a reciprocating saw and to find out why the following models are top choices for a variety of demolition purposes.</p>",100
1210,work pants,"<p>Work pants, designed to take more wear and tear than other trousers, must be tough enough to withstand the constant bending, kneeling, and climbing required on active job sites. They should be made from highly durable fabrics to resist rips and sewn together in ways that make them stronger and more resilient to splits. The best work pants should not only be up to the physical demands of your projects, they should be comfortable enough to work all day in without binding, pinching, or scratching. Ahead, learn what to look for when shopping for work pants, and find out why the following are among the top choices for DIYers and pros alike.</p>",112
1211,wood burning tool,"<p>If you’re looking to express yourself creatively in a new way—to add an extra touch to your projects or perhaps to start a small craft business—pyrography might be your inner artist’s new outlet. Pyrography is the art of writing and/or drawing on wood, leather, and other materials with an extremely hot metal pen, and the results can be quite impressive.</p> <p>To practice pyrography, purchase the best wood-burning tool for your specific needs. There are products from stand-alone tools to well-stocked kits, some for beginners and some for seasoned pros. This guide will help you sort through them and describe why the following products are considered among some of the best wood-burning tools available.</p>",113
1212,jointer,"<p>A jointer is a woodworking machine that smooths and flattens the face and edge of stock lumber to make it perfectly square. Instead of running a tool against wood like one would do using a hand planer, with a jointer, the wood is pushed against the tool.</p> <p>A jointer consists of a long flat surface bisected by a cutting head with a cast-iron guide fence. As the wood runs through the jointer, the cutting head’s blades remove a layer of the wood’s surface to create a perfect square. If you’re in the market for a jointer, keep reading to learn what factors you should consider when shopping for one of these powerful tools.</p>",113
1213,bench grinder,"<p>Whether it’s mowing the lawn or chiseling some wood, many household and DIY projects require the use of a bladed hand tool or power tool. At some point, you’ll need to sharpen those blades—or you’ll need to remove rust and corrosion, whether on the blade or elsewhere. Those are the instances in which a bench grinder proves its utility.</p> <p>The best bench grinders sharpen steel and remove rust much more quickly than an old-fashioned whetstone, and without significantly less effort. Bench grinders typically feature two grinding wheels, often with different grits. On many models, the grinding wheels can be swapped out for metal brush wheels— a boon when cleaning metal connectors and spark plugs—or for buffing wheels, designed for putting a fine shine on metal or plastic surfaces.</p> <p>Besides being well made and easy to use, many of the best bench grinders also protect the tool user’s eyes against sparks and fine metal shards generated during the grinding process. (You should always still wear eye protection when using a bench grinder, though!)</p> <p>While bench grinders are straightforward power tools, DIYers and pros prefer certain models based on their ease of use, power, and speed (measured in rotations per minute, or RPM). These factors have been taken into consideration in selecting the following eight bench grinders as the best available for specific situations and users. Any of these bench grinders would be a good addition to your workshop.</p>",237
1214,airbrush compressor,"<p>An airbrush is a specialized tool that uses pressurized air to spray paint, ink, dye, or other liquid mediums. It’s essentially a delicate form of spray painting used in crafting and art projects like decorating cakes, applying makeup, or painting on vehicles and interior walls.</p> <p>An airbrush gets its power from an airbrush compressor. An airbrush compressor provides the airflow that propels paint, ink, or dye out of the tip of the airbrush. Simply put, the compressor gives an airbrush its mojo, so it’s important to buy the right one.</p> <p>The best airbrush compressor for you will depend on the kinds of projects you do and how much power you need. Read on for reviews of some of the best airbrush compressors.</p>",122
1215,framing nailer,"<p>There was a time when neighbors could tell a crew was framing a house by the sound of metal-on-metal-on-wood, since hammering nails was the only way to connect large dimensional lumber. These days, that sound is a thing of the past, replaced by the repetitive “pop!” of framing nailers. These powerful tools operate by using combustion, electricity, or compressed air to create enough force to fire nails up to 3½ inches long into wood.</p> <p>A huge boon to the construction industry and ambitious DIYers alike, framing nailers speed up what was once only possible through tedious manual labor. But just as the framing nailer is a specific type of nail gun, there are also different categories of framing nailers with varying features and functions geared to specific uses.</p> <p>For anyone in the market for the best framing nailer, this guide will provide information to help make the right decision by describing why the following are among the best framing nailer options available.</p>",162
1216,heated vest,"<p>When temperatures drop, working outdoors can become downright uncomfortable if you don’t have a way to stay warm. You need to move freely in some outdoor occupations, including construction, surveying, and landscaping, so piling on constricting clothing layers isn’t an option. That’s where heated vests come in. These typically lightweight garments, which fit easily over a shirt or under a jacket, feature battery-heated panels that help keep your core warm so you can continue to work.</p> <p>I’d heard a lot about heated vests in the past few years, but I wanted to know if they lived up to the hype. Are they cumbersome? Do they really keep your core warm enough to stave off a bitter chill? Will they survive snow, rain, or sleet? These and other questions were on my mind as I tested several of the top sellers available today. I put these vests through their paces, tested all of their functions, and noted how long they stayed warm on a single battery charge.</p> <p>The best heated vest for you depends on the outdoor temperature and how much additional heat you need to stay warm and comfortable. Ahead, learn what to look for in a heated vest, and find out how the following models fared in my extensive testing.</p>",211
1217,contour gauge,"<p>Whether you’re installing flooring, siding, tile, or some other material, you may eventually run into a door frame, set of pipes, or odd-shaped trim that you’ll need to work around. Rather than using a piece of paper and pencil to trace the shape, or applying an obscure equation from high school trigonometry, consider using a contour gauge.</p> <p>These simple but invaluable tools resemble a comb with a long row of thin pins. When pushed against an object, the pins conform to the object’s shape, creating a mold that you can use to trace cut-lines on flooring, tile, or other material.</p> <p>If you need a contour gauge to help you work around irregular shapes in your next project, read on to learn about the features to consider when shopping for one of these handy tools. And check out our list of some of the best contour gauges for woodworking that you can buy.</p>",152
1218,drill presses,"<p>A hand drill is controlled by the user’s hand and arm, so human error can create a hole that’s slightly off-center. A drill press produces perfectly aligned holes of equal size every time, depending on the model. There are many different kinds of drill presses, including magnetic, a floor model, and a mounter or workbench design.</p> <p>When choosing the best drill press for you, factor in the thickness of the material—average drill depth is around 2 to 6 inches—and the type of material you’re working with: Dense wood and metal require more power to drill through than softwoods and plastic. The list of top picks below was assembled after a thorough review of the market and in-depth product vetting.</p>",119
1219,tile saw,"<p>When setting out on a tile project, it’s as important to give as much consideration to the tile saw used as the tile itself. The best tile saws use diamond blades to cut glass, ceramic, and other materials, though they differ in beds, power, and water reservoirs―all factors to keep in mind when selecting the right saw for the work.</p> <p>That’s just the beginning. Many (but not all) tile saws also use water on the spinning blade to reduce friction, noise, and dust while also increasing the blade’s longevity. Don’t forget to weigh the option of sliding beds, which many believe make it easier for you to accurately and safely slide a tile under the blade. With all of these available features, you can wind up with the wrong tile saw if you don’t carefully consider your project’s details. Start your project by reviewing the shopping tips and recommendations in this guide.</p>",152
1220,wire stripper,"<p>A wire stripper boosts productivity for professional electricians, budding apprentices, and DIYers, but with a variety of models on the market, the best one depends on the wire the user is working with. We wanted to know how today’s top wire strippers perform in real-life projects, so we tested them. We cut and stripped a wide range of wire types and sizes, awarding points based on how well each tool functioned.</p> <p>Wire strippers can be more versatile than folks might think. Their primary purpose is to cut and remove the rubber coating that encases wire (known as the jacket), but some of the best models slice thick cables, cut screws to size, and crimp terminals onto the end of cables or wires.<br/> Whether the user needs a basic or professional-grade wire stripper, there is an array from which to choose. Ahead, learn what to consider when shopping for the best wire stripper and find out how the following tools earned a spot in this lineup based on our hands-on tests.</p>",170
1221,pocket knife sharpener,"<p>Any professional chef will tell you that a sharp knife is a safe knife—and that goes for your trusty pocket knife as much as any kitchen utensil. Trying to muscle a dull knife through an object is how people get hurt. When you consider a pocket knife’s small grip size, overpowering a blade’s edge can lead to disastrous consequences. We tend to use pocket knives in challenging, relatively dynamic circumstances, like cutting rope, opening packages, or carving a clean tip on a stick for a marshmallow roast; these activities only become more difficult with a dull knife. The best pocket knife sharpeners will keep your blade honed and fresh, making short (and safe) work of a carving or cutting project. Plus, most are small enough to carry in your pocket along with your knife for convenience on the go, while others can easily stow away in a hiking pack.</p> <p>Pocket knives tend to be very personal to their carrier with some families handing them down from generation to generation, more like family heirlooms than tools. So when it comes to keeping a perfectly honed edge on a prized possession, only the best pocket knife sharpener will do. You’re sure to find yours among the eight sharpeners reviewed here, selected for quality, price, and customer satisfaction.</p>",215
1222,dovetail jig,"<p>For DIYers looking to increase their craftsmanship during woodworking projects, dovetail jigs could be the answer. These jigs allow users to create strong and accurate dovetail joints for boxes, drawers, and furniture without fasteners. In fact, some craftspeople consider a dovetail jig an essential tool for any woodworking shop.</p> <p>The best dovetail jigs clamp workpieces in place, allowing users to run a router along a template. This creates an interweaving joint that looks like a series of bird’s tails, just as the name implies. A dovetail joint is a very strong, stable joint with plenty of surface for gluing. This guide will help shoppers choose the best dovetail jig for any workshop.</p>",112
1223,ratcheting wrench set,"<p>You’ll find many kinds of wrenches and sockets in millions of garages across the country. They are indispensable for working on your car, your lawnmower, your kids’ bikes, and more. A ratcheting wrench set is a particularly worthwhile investment; it’s an affordable choice, yet it can also offer considerably more functionality depending on the model you choose. Some ratcheting wrenches can work at angles that just aren’t possible with a standard wrench, for example, while many also work with a far wider range of modern fasteners.</p> <p>Before you decide to purchase a wrench, take a look at some of the best ratcheting wrench sets on the market today. They are tremendously versatile, with the simplicity of an open-ended wrench plus the effortless action and solid hold of a socket. If you buy a wrench set, it’s likely that sooner or later you’ll want to purchase a socket set as well (or vice versa). With a ratcheting wrench set, you’ve covered your bases, and you could save money, too. Below are some of the top picks for you to consider while shopping for the best ratcheting wrench set for your needs.</p>",190
1224,woodworking clamps,"<p>Between gluing materials, building picture frames, assembling cabinetry, or doing other shop activities, having the right clamp for each job can be critical. Woodworkers use clamps for any number of jobs around the shop when an extra pair of hands is needed. Depending on your use, the best woodworking clamp for your project may be one of several varieties. Keep reading to learn about some of the best woodworking clamps that you can choose for your workshop.</p>",77
1225,telescoping ladder,"<p>If you find yourself tired of lugging heavy, traditional ladders around, you may want to look into the best telescoping ladders. Made from aluminum, they extend up to 10 feet or more and then retract to a size small enough to carry under one arm. Telescoping ladders are popping up everywhere but are they really sturdy enough to use safely? We wanted to know how durable these ladders are, so we decided to test the most popular ones on the market today.</p> <p>We didn’t pull any punches with our tests; we put the ladders through their paces with our main focus being on safety and stability.

The latter makes for fast material removal when cutting mortises, particularly when used in a drill press. Forstner bits are also popular with woodturners, allowing large, deep holes to be cut on a lathe.</p> <p>While available singly, Forstner bits are usually sold as boxed collections of eight or more.

Though these require a little more effort, both DIYers and professionals prefer them because they can use them in the field.</p> <p>To find the best chainsaw sharpener for your needs, keep reading to learn which features are most important and some of the best chainsaw sharpener options out there.</p>",104
1269,pin nailers,"<p>There are certain situations in finish carpentry and woodworking where a big finish or brad nail just won’t do. These fasteners often act like wedges through thinner pieces of wood, causing them to split or crack. And when they don’t crack, they leave behind large holes that require going back with wood putty to fill them. The good news is there’s another option: the stealth, compact pin nailer.</p> <p>Pin nailers, also known as micro pinners, drive very thin fasteners that are actually just sturdy wires. The pins themselves come in stacks similar to those inserted into finish or brad nailers, but they don’t have a head, meaning a pin nailer can drive one without leaving a noticeable hole. Although they don’t offer a ton of holding strength, the best pin nailers can be a huge asset for trim, woodworking, and crafts.</p>",141
1270,jointer planer combos,"<p>Buying rough lumber can save a lot of money and offers the opportunity to find and use interesting varieties. However, proper preparation is vital, or the finished result may be poor. Before anything else, one side needs to be flattened and is called the face. Another edge is machined at 90 degrees to the face side in order to have true surfaces as a starting point for accurate measurements.</p> <p>A jointer is the tool used to create a flat face and square up the edge. It can also bevel the edge if necessary. Once that is done, a planer (often called a thickness planer) can be used to make the second face parallel to the first and bring the wood down to the required thickness.</p> <p>Jointer planer combos are both of these machines in one tool. They are convenient and can be a space-saving alternative, but they’re sometimes misunderstood. Keep reading to find out the pros and cons, the key features, and some suggestions for the best jointer planer combo for a variety of needs.</p>",175

Keep reading to learn more about the important features, and consider transforming your patio or backyard into a smart outdoor space with one of the following outdoor smart plug options.</p>",113
1272,portable air compressor,"<p>Pneumatic tools that run by a portable air compressor can be a huge help and time-saver on a range of projects and at the construction site. Nail guns, for instance, drive fasteners with the pull of a trigger rather than pounds of a hammer. Impact wrenches can apply tons of torque and twisting power in seconds. Filling a truck tire will go from a nearly impossible task to a cinch with a tire inflator. All of these tools use the pressure and volume created by an air compressor.</p> <p>A portable air compressor squeezes air into a metal tank, which it then releases through a hose in order to power a tool. Portable air compressors must be fairly lightweight and compact so one person can pick them up, wheel them around, or lift them into the bed of a truck with ease. To create a small footprint (typically between about 25 and 70 pounds), manufacturers keep tanks small and use lighter-duty motors. While this is great for portability, it often comes at the sacrifice of volume and serviceability.</p> <p>The best portable air compressors are small, handy machines that help make short work of a to-do list, improving accuracy, workflow, and efficiency. Read on to learn what to look for in a portable air compressor and why the following models are among the best in their respective categories.</p>",226
1273,quiet air compressors,"<p>If you think that air compressors are just tools for auto mechanics and house builders, think again. From inflating tires and balls to cleaning electronic devices, powering air tools, painting, and more, quiet air compressors can help make chores easier around the house.</p> <p>While all air compressors pressurize air by pumping it into a storage tank until the operator releases it for a wide variety of purposes, not all are designed for the same tasks. And because so many air tool applications exist, there are a wide variety of compressors with different ratings for air pressure, volume, flow rate, noise level, configuration, and more.</p> <p>When shopping for the best quiet compressor, it is important to think through the ways it could be used in order to know which model has the right combination of specifications.

1275,ph meter,"<p>Whether you’re an amateur gardener, a flower enthusiast, or you’ve got a yard full of fruits and veggies, a pH meter is a valuable, must-have tool for any gardener. A soil pH tester or pH meter can tell you if your soil is acidic or alkaline, which means you’ll know exactly what you can and cannot grow in your yard or indoor garden before you plant it.</p> <p>Most plants do best in soil with a pH of 7, but this isn’t true for every plant. Hydrangeas, for example, like a pH of 5 or 6, whereas okra can do well in soil with a pH of up to 7.5. Finding the best pH meter for your outdoor or indoor garden can help you grow healthy, lush plants.</p>",127
1276,trenching shovels,"<p>An all-purpose shovel will surely come in handy for all sorts of digging projects, but having the best trenching shovel is the ideal go-to when you need to dig deep, narrow holes and the narrow, straight-sided channels known as trenches. Trenching shovels are not made for scooping up piles of dirt and gravel or for digging wide ditches, but their design makes them good at their specific purpose.</p> <p>The blade on a trenching shovel is deep but slim—sometimes only 3 inches in width. Trenching shovels are designed with a sharp point at the tip, which allows the user to drive the blade into the ground better than using a shovel that has a rounded or a blunt blade. While all trenching shovels are similar in style, some offer features that better suit them to targeted tasks. Ahead, learn what to look for when shopping for a trenching shovel, and find out why the following models all scored a spot in this lineup.</p>",162

Be that as it may, there’s no rival or replacement for a good hammer, which is still—and forever will be—a handy person’s must-have. Aside from the screwdriver, a hammer is likely the most frequently reached-for tool, whether it’s for driving nails in or pulling them out.</p> <p>It pays to know what to look for in a quality tool. The right hammer feels good in the hand and makes jobs easier. The wrong hammer can be hard on the wrist and palm, put fingers at higher risk of a smash, or even break during heavy use. Below, read our tips for choosing the best hammer for your needs, and see our roundup of top-favorite picks.</p>",126
1282,wet dry vacuums,"<p>Workshop and DIY projects create piles of sawdust, sanding dust, and all sorts of tiny bits of debris that add to general clutter and chaos. Wet/dry vacuums, sometimes called “shop vacs” because they’re often found in construction and workshop settings, make quick work of cleaning up both liquid spills and dry messes.</p> <p>Another variety of vacuum that cleans up both wet and dry messes is available for in-home use. These vacuum mops perform as traditional vacuums with the added ability to clean up liquid spills and wash flooring.</p> <p>To help on your vacuum-shopping journey, we performed hands-on testing with some of the best wet/dry vacuums on the market.

1287,table saw,"<p>Table saws top the wish lists of both DIYers and seasoned woodworkers. These powerful saws cut with more accuracy than circular saws, and they can cut larger pieces of material, including wood, plastic, and aluminum sheeting, better than miter saws. Some cut certain types of material better than others, so we put some of the best table saws through side-by-side, hands-on testing.</p> <p>Essentially, a table saw’s main function is to perform rips, or cuts along the length of a board. While you can make rip cuts (lengthwise cuts), crosscuts, and angled cuts, and can even create a bevel cut along with dadoes, ripping remains this power tool’s primary purpose.</p> <p>Whether you’re building bookcases, framing a garage, or even making your own trim for a feature wall, having a table saw in your workshop can speed the project along. Read on to learn more about this useful saw and to find out the results of our hands-on tests. One of the following models may be just right for your workshop, whether you’re a pro or a hobbyist.</p>",176
1288,jigsaw,"<p>As an electric saw with a vertically plunging blade, the jigsaw tends to be underappreciated. True, it’s not as powerful or fast as a circular saw, and it can be a little tricky to master. Still, savvy carpenters, woodworkers, metalworkers, and even DIYers know to reach for one of these capable tools to make various cutting tasks a breeze.</p> <p>The jigsaw’s main purpose is to cut curves, but it can also cut lumber to length with ease and create holes and other shapes in materials such as plywood and plastic.

Each of the top picks below was selected after an in-depth review of the market and thorough product vetting.</p>",121
1290,heat gun,"<p>A heat gun is one of the best-kept secrets in an avid DIYer’s toolbox. These handy tools resemble hair dryers by pulling in air with a fan and then pushing it across a heating element and through a nozzle to produce superheated air.</p> <p>Remove product labels or old bumper stickers, strip paint, heat-shrink plastic, soften Super Glue, and apply vehicle decals. You can even use the best heat gun options to bend plastic piping, defrost frozen pipes, or loosen solder joints. As with any tool, quality tends to dictate results, so be sure to choose a well-made product like those below.</p>",101
1291,glues for plastic,"<p>One formula definitely does not fit all when it comes to glues for your DIY projects. Adhesives are chemically designed to work with certain materials. Wood glue, for example, is great for carpentry but won’t be effective on metal. Even Super Glue—possibly your default option for just about anything—has its limits, as cyanoacrylate, which is its active ingredient, doesn’t adhere well to smooth surfaces.</p> <p>Trickier still, gluing plastic depends largely on the target material. A glue that works well bonding plastic to plastic may be a poor choice to adhere plastic to metal or wood. Most DIYers maintain a collection of adhesives to get the job done right the first time. So don’t get stuck using the wrong product. Read on to better understand the properties of the glues on the market and why the choices below rate as the best for all your plastic bonding needs.</p>",147
1292,router bits,"<p>A router is a powered cutting tool that uses different bits to cut various grooves, angles, and shapes into wood.

Or, there are also specialty sets, like a spark plug socket set. The products below represent some of the top socket and tool sets available in their respective categories. Each product underwent thorough vetting and an in-depth review to make it on the list.</p>",136
1295,track saw,"<p>For ripping sheet goods or cutting long lengths of lumber to width, a track saw can often be easier to work with than its counterpart, the table saw. Track saws make fast, accurate, repeatable cuts on sheet goods like plywood, lumber, and medium-density fiberboard.</p> <p>Track saws are not a replacement for table saws; they’re a companion. While they have a bevel capacity of up to 47 degrees like a typical circular saw, they’re purpose-built for precise cuts in heavy hard-to-manage material and are mainly used for square cuts. Probably more precisely referred to as a plunge cut track saw, the saw plunges into the work to begin the cut.</p> <p>They can be quickly clamped in place and provide incredibly accurate cuts, even in dense materials. And the best track saw can be the go-to saw for many jobs. We have field-tested some of the best track saws on the market so we can deliver a solid list of top-quality track saws that are fast, reliable, and powerful enough to get the job done.</p> <p>Keep reading to find out what to consider when selecting a new track saw, and check out the hands-on reviews for these top picks below.</p>",198
1296,work light,"<p>A surefire way to hinder progress is by trying to work in the dark. It fatigues your eyes and your mind. Plus, when you have to do something twice because you couldn’t see well the first time, it can add to your body’s workload. Instead, install the best work light for your workshop or job site. Whether you place a light under a cabinet, on the hood of a car, or in a dimly-lit corner of a room, a good work light is always a welcome work companion.</p> <p>The best work lights come with stands or hooks while some are designed for handheld use. They shine in spots where you can’t see, helping you to complete a project correctly and efficiently. This guide will help you choose the best work light for your needs.</p>",134
1297,heated gloves,"<p>If your hands feel like blocks of ice when you shovel snow, ski or enjoy other outdoor sports, have an arthritic flare-up, or work in a chilly office, you may have wondered if a pair of heated gloves would help. Manufacturers design traditional winter gloves to keep cold temps away from your hands, but they’re only effective if your hands start out warm and your body temperature stays warm. As a helpful alternative, heated gloves (and mittens) are becoming increasingly popular. When I got the chance to test various gloves from popular brands personally, I was happy to do so.</p> <p>Heated gloves come in an array of sizes and styles. Unlike traditional gloves, heated ones have elements that generate heat, usually through tiny electrical wires and small rechargeable batteries. Most “electric” gloves require the user to press a button to start the warmth. Some heated gloves can be heated in the microwave, and other types are chemically heated with warming packs containing iron and other components that generate heat when exposed to oxygen.</p> <p>I tested many types from different brands in my quest to find the best heated gloves. Each pair of gloves was tested for comfort and durability and then awarded points based on how well they heated and how long they remained warm. The gloves were also tested for ease of use and to see if they stood up to manufacturers’ claims, such as being waterproof. Ahead, learn which features are among the most important to consider when choosing a pair of heated gloves, and find out how each of the following pairs fared in my hands-on tests. Spoiler: Some are deliciously warm!</p>",275
1298,drill bit sharpener,"<p>Drill bits aren’t cheap, but they do seem to dull quickly.

These tools can help put a sharp point on an older drill bit, grinding the tip at the perfect angle. The result is a fast-drilling, clean-cutting drill bit that works as well, if not better, than new.</p> <p>Whether you choose an electric benchtop sharpener or a grinder attachment, there’s a solution for your dull drill bits. Your drill bits will last much longer if you choose the best drill bit sharpener for your needs from this guide.</p>",134
1299,needle nose pliers,"<p>Needle-nose pliers have long, pointy jaws for reaching into narrow or tight spots, such as the backs of electrical outlet boxes or crevices in car engines. They can also help users get a grip on tiny objects at awkward angles. These spiked grasping tools are a go-to when faced with small jobs that require precision. But which models perform the best? That was our question, and the only way to get an accurate answer was to test today’s top contenders ourselves.</p> <p>So that’s what we did. We selected the best-selling needle-nose pliers on the market and put them through their paces. We didn’t pull any punches and we didn’t give them any slack. We grasped frozen nuts and exerted as much twisting force as we could muster. We jabbed the needle noses into impossibly tight spots, and we used them to bend and twist wires and cables. When we finished testing, we examined the tools to determine whether the jaws were still in alignment.</p> <p>Ahead, learn what to look for when shopping for the best needle-nose pliers, and find out how the following models earned a spot on our lineup.</p>",190
1300,cordless screwdriver,"<p>Whether working on a bicycle, replacing kitchen outlets, putting batteries in a child’s remote control car, or completing another DIY project, a cordless screwdriver can come in handy to tighten and remove screws quickly and efficiently. Think of a cordless screwdriver as a less powerful alternative to a corded (or cordless) drill.</p> <p>Cordless screwdrivers don’t have the power to drive through a lot of dense material, so don’t plan on building an entire storage shed with one. However, they can be a good option for light to medium jobs like running screws to hang pictures on walls, tightening cabinet door hinges, and removing outlet covers and switch plates. We’re big fans of power tools that make DIYers’ lives easier, and cordless screwdrivers rate right up there at the top.</p> <p>With so many brands and models of cordless screwdrivers to choose from, it’s important to know which ones would be real assets in a DIYer’s tool collection and which ones didn’t live up to the hype. We tested several of today’s top models to determine their torque power, overall design, and how effectively they functioned in multiple situations. We put them through their paces, and we didn’t pull any punches—the testing was rigorous and we pushed the tools to their limits.</p> <p>Don’t guess at how well today’s most popular cordless screwdrivers perform.

This guide will discuss key considerations when shopping for the best cobalt drill bits and highlight our top recommendations.</p>",72
1303,cordless hammer drill,"<p>Drilling through concrete, tiles, and stone requires extra force from a drill, and the most powerful corded drill drivers lack it. These types of projects call for the best cordless hammer drill.</p> <p>The best cordless hammer drills do two things simultaneously: they spin a drill bit while a small gear inside the drill forces a weight forward, striking the back of the chuck. The force carries through to the tip to chip away small bits of concrete, stone, or brick while the grooves in the bit remove the resulting dust. Read on for some tips and top products.</p>",98
1304,torque wrench,"<p>A torque wrench is a specialized tool prominent in automotive repair that addresses various parts of a car. For example, to ensure a vehicle operates correctly, you must tighten the wheels to a specific torque level, following the manufacturer’s directions. The torque wrench sets the torque limit so you don’t accidentally overtighten the fasteners.</p> <p>However, a torque wrench should not be used for loosening fasteners. This can cause the torque wrench to become uncalibrated, meaning you may not reach (or you might exceed) your desired torque level. Thankfully, you can take your wrench to a local home supply store to have it calibrated, or attempt to calibrate it yourself. The products below have been chosen as some of the best torque wrenches in their respective category based on product efficacy and overall value.</p>",133
1305,cordless impact wrench,"<p>There are few things more frustrating than struggling with stubborn nuts and bolts that don’t want to budge. A handheld ratchet wrench has its well-deserved place in every garage, but sometimes something with real moving and twisting power is necessary. That’s where the impact wrench comes in.</p> <p>These power tools have the capacity to loosen or tighten even the most stubborn fasteners with minimal effort. Though they used to be available only as air-powered (pneumatic) options that required an air hose and compressor, technological innovations have led to the creation of cordless options that can go practically anywhere. So, if it’s time to replace those air hoses with batteries, read on for tips on finding the best cordless impact wrench.</p> <p><strong>ALSO TESTED:</strong></p>",122

These large storage systems offer far more space than tool boxes, in the form of multidrawer tool storage, but that usually makes them heavier and harder to transport.

Climbing up and down repeatedly to switch out tools is exhausting, and possibly dangerous, as the risk of injury by falling increases with fatigue.</p> <p>When looking for the best electrician tool belt, keep in mind that comfort is key. Make sure it fits correctly; you don’t want to be holding your breath to close the belt or pulling it up every two minutes to keep it from falling off.

Leather and nylon have comparable durability, but polyester carries a price advantage. You should also note the type of storage the belt has and how much is available.

1394,impact sockets,"<p>If you’ve spent any length of time working on automobiles, you’ve likely come across the benefits an impact wrench offers over a handheld ratchet wrench for loosening lug nuts and stuck-on bolts. Greater torque and power translates into greater tightening and loosening force, allowing you to work on stubborn nuts and bolts with greater speed and reduced manual effort. However, trying to use a standard socket set that’s not designed to withstand these higher levels of torque can easily damage or destroy your precious sockets.</p> <p>That’s where impact sockets come in. They are made from either chrome-molybdenum or an impact-grade chrome vanadium instead of the less durable chrome vanadium that standard sockets are made with. Then, they’re “carbonized” to make them even more rugged, and it’s this process that gives them their characteristic black color. And their use isn’t limited to just impact wrenches; they can also be used in an impact driver with a socket adapter or in a handheld ratchet wrench—making them incredibly versatile. Read on to learn about the characteristics of the best impact sockets, and discover some of the highest-rated products on the market.</p>",188
1395,milling machine,"<p>During the milling process, metal, wood, or plastic is fed through a rotating, multipoint cutter on a table that moves to the left and right as well as forward and backward. The milling cutter can be raised or lowered to adjust the depth of the cut, similar to the vertical movement of a drill press. The tool’s three axes of control allow for precision cutting over the entire surface of the material.</p> <p>Milling machines can be used for a variety of purposes, including machining flat and contoured surfaces, creating external and internal threads, and cutting gears and slots. When looking for a milling machine, consider key factors, such as the size and cutting capacity, that your projects require. Below find a list of some top options and details about milling machine features to help you find the best option for your workshop.</p>",142
1396,titanium hammer,"<p>Hammers have been an essential carpentry tool for centuries and are found in practically every household tool chest. For as long as they’ve been around, most hammers have had steel hammer heads. As effective and rugged as steel is, it has some drawbacks. For one thing it’s pretty heavy, which can make wielding a hammer with a steel head fatiguing as well as a noticeable weight on your tool belt.</p> <p>Steel is also not very good at transferring energy, which means a lot of the vibration produced from striking a steel hammerhead will transfer to your hand instead of the surface you’re striking. Steel’s lack of shock absorption can also contribute to fatigue. Fortunately, there’s a better material from which to make quality hammers: titanium.</p> <p>Titanium hammers are more efficient than steel at transferring energy. In fact, a titanium hammer transfers up to 97 percent of energy to a nail (or other striking surfaces), whereas steel transfers about 70 percent. Titanium’s energy transfer rate also means less recoil: These hammers produce just 3 percent recoil, compared to a 30 percent recoil from steel hammers.</p> <p>Perhaps its biggest advantage is that titanium is 45 percent lighter than steel. All in all, its lighter weight and efficient transfer of energy means that using a titanium hammer translates to greater striking power and reduced fatigue. Whether you seek a new general-purpose hammer or framing hammer, read on to learn more about how to choose the best titanium hammer for your needs.</p>",248

1398,compact circular saw,"<p>Circular saws are important tools for many workshops, capable of custom cuts in a wide variety of materials including metal, concrete, wood, and plastic.

1401,anti fog safety glasses,"<p>Safety gear is required on job sites for a variety of professions, and DIYers are strongly advised to follow that lead when tackling projects. Depending on the task, this may mean hearing protection, knee pads, and—whether in a home workshop, at a construction site, or in a medical facility—anti-fog safety glasses.

1405,electric hand planers,"<p>Despite painstakingly perfect measurements and perfect cuts, there are times when wood just doesn’t cooperate. Whether it’s a door in an old home that sticks as it closes, a joist that is level but somehow still too tall compared with the others, or a glue-up of boards that ended up just a bit too wide, experienced DIYers see these frustrations happen all too often.</p> <p>Although it’s possible to make many of these repairs with circular saws or other tools, it can be tough to achieve accurate results.

If you plan on using the carabiner for walking your dog, securing items, or camping, go with a medium-purpose product. You won’t be able to use it for climbing, but it should cover just about everything else.</p> <p>Also consider the color of the carabiner.

The best EDC (everyday carry) knife is relatively small and lightweight, so it’s easy to slip into a pocket or purse and ready whenever you need it.</p> <p>The most common type of EDC knife is a folding knife, often called a pocket knife, that features a 2.5- to 5-inch blade paired with a 3- to 5-inch handle. Non-folding knives can also qualify as EDC knives, but they usually include a sheath that attaches to a belt or a boot.</p> <p>When shopping for an everyday carry knife, look for quality over a fancy design. The best EDC knife will have a razor-sharp, durable blade, often made from carbon steel or stainless steel and combined with a hardener, such as vanadium. A good locking mechanism is also important because it keeps the blade from folding onto your fingers while busy whittling a work of art.

1416,gas hedge trimmer,"<p>Hedges and bushes are assets to any home’s landscaping, providing much-needed privacy around patios and along property lines—until they get overgrown and require trimming, which can be a laborious chore.

1420,chainsaw bar oils,"<p>Before starting a chainsaw, be sure to top up the bar oil.

Instead, bar oil works on the exterior moving parts of the saw, keeping the chain, guide bar, and sprockets properly conditioned to cut efficiently.</p> <p>With dozens of options available, it can be difficult to sort out which bar oil is right for your chainsaw and working conditions.

1424,pry bar,"<p>Wrecking bars, crowbars, and pry bars are often combined in the same category, but important differences exist.

A butane torch creates a flame that can reach a maximum temperature of about 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit. These high temperatures—coupled with butane’s long flames, which can reach up to 6 inches long—make these torches capable of melting and soldering metals like copper and silver.

1426,sharpening stone,"<p>Having a set of dull kitchen knives isn’t just inconvenient—it can also be very dangerous. Blunt blades require more pressure to cut through food.

1428,soil for herbs,"<p>Whether for cooking, creating aromatic blends, or mixing natural medicines, herbs—the leafy plant parts typically harvested for their seasoning and health benefits—add a certain zing to life.

1431,drywall anchors,"<p>Drywall—comprised of compressed gypsum (a soft sulfite mineral)—creates wonderfully smooth walls. Yet insert a nail or screw into it and it’s likely to crumble, often resulting in the fastener working loose and the hung item falling to the floor. The solution is to use drywall anchors, which are designed to spread within or behind the drywall panel, creating pressure that locks the anchor in place.</p> <p>Rather than just picking up a random drywall anchor, users need to think carefully about the amount of support needed for the item intended to hang on the wall.
