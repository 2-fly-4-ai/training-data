0,car lifts for home garages,"<p>Despite being lifelong gearheads, putting together a list of the best car lifts for home garages was no small task. We had to put together all of our experience wrenching on project vehicles and repairing daily drivers to come up with some of the most important features to look for in a car lift.</p> <p>Once we knew what to look for, we performed extensive product research to find models that met our needs. We compared these models based on their capacities, abilities, and prices, ensuring that we were suggesting car lifts that provide real value despite their cost. The models that didn’t make it were tossed to the side while those that passed were given awards based on their strengths.</p>",120
1,space heaters for basements,"<p>Basements or basement rooms come in a variety of sizes and are used for a variety of functions. Finding a single best space heater that will meet all these demands is practically impossible, so we wanted to offer a variety of devices, each of which has certain strengths. It’s not just about finding the most powerful basement heater—it’s about finding models that meet the needs of as many different people as possible.</p> <p>Quality and value were also priorities. Cheap space heaters are widely available, but performance can be disappointing, and many lack the reliability we would expect. Nevertheless, our top picks do include some very affordable models, so there should be something for all budgets.</p> <h2>Safety Tips for Using Space Heaters for Basements</h2> <p>Any source of heat has the potential to cause a fire. While many space heaters have built-in safety features like tip-over sensors, there are a few simple steps you can take to make sure your home is safe.</p> <ul><li>The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National Fire Protection Association both recommend a minimum 3-foot gap between the space heater and any other object.</li><li>Turn off and unplug the space heater when not in the room. Many space heaters produce rapid warmth so there’s little need to leave them on when the basement is not occupied. Turning them off will also save money.</li><li>If the space heater has a hot surface that could burn people or pets, situate it away from places that get a lot of passing traffic. Alternatively, choose a wall-mounted model that can be raised out of the way.</li><li>Only plug space heaters directly into wall sockets, not into an extension cord or power strip, as these may overheat.</li><li>Ensure that there’s a functioning smoke alarm in the room.</li></ul>",290
2,car vacuum,"<p>Given that we have several different types of car vacuums among our top picks, we used criteria that encompassed a variety of characteristics.</p> <ul><li>Performance: A shop vac has a bigger motor than even the best cordless handheld vacuum, but each suits different users. What is important is that each device has appropriate power for its size. Lack of suction is hugely frustrating, so models that underperform were not considered.</li><li>Ergonomics and versatility: While weight alone is seldom a problem, poor balance can make a car vacuum awkward to use. Although our main focus was on car vacuums, we considered those that can also be used for household tasks, such as sucking up minor spills or accomplishing heavy-duty cleaning.</li><li>Brand and value: The quality and reliability of cheap car vacuums can be inconsistent. We chose tried-and-tested models that have sold in large numbers, thus ensuring a proven track record.</li></ul>",146
3,dehumidifiers for basements,"<p>The important features to be considered when buying a basement dehumidifier are discussed in detail above, and these formed a key part of our selection criteria. However, most of the leading models share similar feature sets regardless of size, so it can be challenging to choose between them.</p> <p>When making our choices we have tried to offer as wide a selection as possible. Brand reputation is another crucial factor. Generally-speaking, buying from the leading manufacturers ensures reliability and durability. Cost was another consideration, and the resulting list should offer something for different property sizes and budgets.</p> <h2>Basement Dehumidifier Brands to Consider</h2> <p>To get a better sense of the dehumidifiers on the market today, here are a few of the most trusted brands we recommend:</p> <ul><li>Aprilaire creates reliable dehumidifiers, humidifiers, thermostats, air purifiers and filters, and more. Though some products are on the expensive side, this company values innovative, reliable designs in small and large spaces. Founded in 1954, this ENERGY STAR-certified brand includes digital control panels and corrosion-resistant coils on their products for long lifespans and durability. When it comes to this brand’s dehumidifiers, each one comes with a built-in drain and only requires yearly maintenance and filter replacement. Plus, this brand offers models that are compatible with 2,200 to 7,200 square foot spaces.</li><li>Honeywell is one of the most well-known brands for air filtration and quality with humidifiers, heaters, thermostats, and more in their inventory. With 11 different dehumidifier models available, there is a range of options for spaces of 2000 to 4000 square feet at affordable price points. Many of these ENERGY STAR-certified models also come with 30-70 pint tanks, pumps, wheels, and handles for portability and ease of use. Finally, each of the dehumidifiers in their inventory come with glossy white constructions that look good in any room.</li><li>Homelabs offers 10 different dehumidifier models intended for commercial and residential use. Though they also carry HEPA air filters, refrigerators, air conditioners, kitchen appliances, and more, their dehumidifiers are some of the most popular products sold in their inventory. With tank sizes ranging from 16 ounces to 50 pints, this brand offers dehumidifiers for small and large spaces and most models have built-in wheels and handles for maneuvering. For added convenience, this brand has select models that are ENERGY STAR-certified and all of the dehumidifiers are budget-friendly.</li><li>FRIGIDAIRE offers high-tech dehumidifiers with ENERGY STAR-certifications and WiFi connectivity included. Though some of their dehumidifiers are on the pricey side and there are only 6 models to choose from, some of their large picks can remove over 60 pints worth of humidity per day. For smaller spaces, there are also 22-pint constructions available. Digital control panels, ionizers for airborne particles, and the convenience of washable, reusable filters also makes this brand’s dehumidifiers convenient and easy to use.</li><li>LG carries a single, smart dehumidifier that comes with built-in wheels, a large digital control panel, and an ENERGY STAR certification. As LG constructs many types of household appliances and tools, this brand has a stellar reputation and dedicated customers. Its dehumidifier offers the same reliability and ease of use as many of its appliances, as it has a safety standby, thermal resistance, and sturdy metal construction. It also drains continuously, has humidity auto control, a washable filter, and automatic restart.</li><li>Haier offers 4 different types of dehumidifiers ranging from 20 to 50 pint tanks. Though this brand is well-known for kitchen, laundry, and air quality appliances, their dehumidifiers come with smart technology including smart dry, an empty bucket alarm, built-in pumps, and filter reminders. Each of their dehumidifiers is also ENERGY STAR-certified, affordable, and come in glossy, white constructions with wheels to fit in any space.</li><li>Toshiba is a well-known brand for cooking appliances, air conditioners, and, of course, dehumidifiers. With 20 to 50 pint tanks included, each of these models comes equipped with automatic and manual humidity settings, change filter and full tank alerts, and ENERGY STAR ratings. Select picks also have built-in wheels, and a continuous run option. Though these dehumidifiers are reliable and affordable, none of them come with a drain hose.</li></ul>",676
4,garage cabinets,"<p>We researched the most sought-after garage cabinets in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, size, materials, ease of installation and use, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best garage cabinets available, the most popular types among users were the storage systems, wall-mounted, modular, rolling, freestanding, and overhead units with their ample storage capacity and durable powder-coated, alloy, and heavy-gauge steel constructions. Many of these models are adjustable, have high weight capacities of up to 800 pounds, and come with the mounting hardware required for installation.</p> <p>For added convenience, some of these cabinets come with magnetized or lockable doors, work surfaces, or even gridded designs for hanging bikes, tools, and other objects.</p>",125
5,gas can,"<p>We researched the most sought-after gas cans in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their construction, included safety features, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While researching the best gas cans available, we found that plastic constructions were among the most popular for their compact, lightweight, and ergonomic designs. While less popular, the metal gas cans are a good alternative as they are more durable and include extensive safety features. Regardless of construction, the above picks range from 1 to 14 gallons in capacity depending upon your fuel needs.</p> <p>Most of the above picks also come with spouts included for easy refueling, with some coming with automatic shutoff or ventilating capabilities. Some of the best options we researched also included flame arresters, spill-proof designs, built-in wheels and handles, siphoning hand pumps, and integrated fuel gauges.</p>",143
6,drain cleaner,"<p>To curate this list, we researched each drain cleaner product and analyzed the various chemical compounds and byproducts. Additionally, we considered the type of drain cleaner, the suitability of each product, and the average or expected working time of the product.</p> <p>Generally, we chose drain cleaners with short working times, though we gave enzymatic products some leeway in this category because they are environmentally friendly, safe for septic systems, and won’t damage plumbing.</p> <p>Caustic and acidic selections usually work within minutes, but the effectiveness of each product depends on its formula. Some can be used in standing water, septic systems, and garbage disposals, while others are limited to partial clogs. Additionally, we preferred products with features that make them more effective, such as a clinging gel instead of a liquid.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Drain Cleaner</h2> <p>Follow these guidelines to use drain cleaners safely and effectively.</p> <ul><li>Always read and follow the directions, adhering to specific amounts and dwell times. Never leave any type of drain cleaner inside drains for longer than the maximum dwell time. Chemical cleaners, in particular, can produce enough heat to melt pipes or crack porcelain toilet bowls if left too long.</li><li>Use caustic or acidic cleaners only in well-ventilated rooms. Turn on exhaust fans and/or open windows to increase air circulation.</li><li>Always stand outside of tubs or showers when pouring drain cleaner.</li><li>With the drain stopper removed, pour the drain cleaner as slowly and steadily as possible into the clogged drain.</li><li>If using a caustic cleaner, avoid exposing it to any natural stone surfaces surrounding a drain (such as a granite sink) to avoid etching it. For the same reason, don’t let acidic cleaners contact non-acid-resistant surfaces (like a marble shower floor or stainless steel sink). Some chemical cleaner manufacturers recommend applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the metal surface area around the drain to stave off discoloration or damage.</li><li>Never mix drain cleaners with other homemade or commercial cleaners; the chemical reaction that ensues could produce toxic gas or an explosion.</li><li>Flush any remaining cleaner with water at the temperature recommended in the manufacturer’s instructions.</li></ul>",345
7,rv sewer hoses,"<p>We used several criteria when making our choices for our list of the top RV waste hoses. Ease of use and versatility were key. We chose hoses that the user could set up and break down easily, minimizing the time spent at the dump station. And since no two dump stations are alike, we favored models that could capably reach distances both short and long and work with a variety of sewer drain types. To make our list, the kit’s fittings needed to be easy to attach and detach without the need for special tools. They also needed to have translucent elbow adapters that would allow the user to easily monitor the flow of wastewater. Since sewer hoses tend to take a beating, we also chose thicker hoses made from durable materials. Portability is also crucial, so we only chose hoses that would condense to a small enough size to be easily stored.</p>",153
8,showerhead,"<p>The best shower head will provide what you’re looking for in terms of how you want to feel. Do you want a lot of pressure, or do you prefer a massage? Our list of recommendations aims to provide options that cover all of these needs. Many of our top picks also come in multiple finishes—since for those replacing an existing shower head, it should probably match the current bathroom fixtures. We also made sure to recommend products that help the environment and reduce water flow while also providing decent water pressure.</p> <p>Choosing between fixed and handheld shower heads can make a difference in your shower experience. As such, our research has gathered several of the best products in their categories, providing a list of handheld and fixed options, as well as 2-in-1 combo units. Ultimately, the shower is a place to relax and even hide out sometimes, so consider all your options carefully so you can have the best shower experience.</p>",161
9,toilet bowl cleaner,"<p>We researched the most sought-after toilet bowl cleaners in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, ease of use, cleaning power, and longevity.</p> <p>In researching the best options available, automatic toilet bowl cleaners were among the most popular for their ease of use, while liquids, gels, cleaning systems, and brushes were also viable alternatives. While all of the above top picks are effective at cleaning the interior of a toilet, each also requires limited labour or maintenance to work correctly.</p> <p>Whether getting hands-on in the cleaning process or allowing the product to work for you, this list provides options that tackle limescale, soap scum, rust, stains, hard water deposits, and calcium based on your cleaning needs. Finally, the toilet bowl cleaners included are meant to last for weeks at a time, with some keeping your toilet clean for over 12 weeks.</p>",148
10,toilet plunger,"<p>When we set out to put together a list of the best toilet plungers, we knew the job would be tough—we were going to have to draw on our experience with plumbing repairs and drain stoppages to think of the features we needed most from a plunger.</p> <p>We performed extensive product research to compile a list of plungers that we felt fit our criteria. Then we compared pricing, ability, and materials to ensure we were only suggesting the best toilet plungers. We threw out the models that ultimately didn’t make the grade, and assigned awards to the ones that did. Those awards are based on their strengths and the features or styles shoppers are most likely to be looking for.</p>",120
11,shower curtains,"<p>The best shower curtain will give your bathroom a minor face-lift by adding a clean new look to the room. The above picks were selected for their stylish designs as well as the materials used and the sizes offered.</p> <p>The above picks prioritize ease of use and convenience which is why many are made with high-performance polyester and come with sturdy, rustproof grommets. Some of the above picks also come with reinforced top headers and moisture-treated materials for a quick-drying effect. For safety, some of our picks are also PVC-free.</p> <p>Though some of the above curtains do not come with liners and hanging hardware, some of these top picks double as liners for convenience. Additionally, there are several machine-washable options, and some come with the availability to purchase them in different sizes.</p> <h3>Material/Fabric</h3> <p>Shower curtains can be made of both synthetic and natural materials. These fabrics each have their own benefits and drawbacks, particularly when it comes to durability and ease of cleaning.</p> <p>Synthetic materials like polyester and plastic are durable, waterproof, and wrinkle resistant. They perform especially well in bathrooms that experience a lot of wear and tear—for example, if you have small children. One drawback with synthetics is they can look and feel a bit stiffer and cheaper than natural fabrics.</p> <p>However, these shower curtains clean up easily: Simply spray with a shower cleaner or toss into the washer and dryer. Polyester is one of the most popular curtain options. It resembles natural fabric in softness but is more water- and mildew-resistant. You can wash a polyester shower curtain in cool water in the washing machine and dry it on the gentlest setting.</p> <p>Natural fabrics like canvas, cotton, hemp, and linen are both eco-friendly and luxurious looking. These fabrics are easily laundered according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Keep in mind, however, that natural fabrics are not waterproof, so you must have a good-quality liner to keep the rest of your bathroom dry.</p> <h3>Size</h3> <p>In general, standard shower curtains measure from 70 to 72 inches in both height and width, but sizes can vary. To determine the correct curtain size for your shower, specific measurements are required.</p> <p>For width, measure the curtain rod, then add 12 inches to include the curtain folds to ensure complete coverage. For height/length, measure from the bottom of the curtain rod to the floor. The bottom edge should just touch the threshold to keep the curtain as free from dirt and moisture as possible.</p> <p>If you have a bathtub, subtract up to 10 inches from the curtain length. Alternatively, add several inches of length if you intend to swag the curtain to one side using tiebacks since the curtain will appear shorter when tied back.</p> <h3>Solid vs. Pattern</h3> <p>A shower curtain takes up a lot of visual space in the bathroom. The current decor can contribute to whether you choose a solid or pattern print.</p> <p>A solid color that blends in might do the trick for those who already have different patterns—like pictures and prints—elsewhere in the bathroom. Conversely, for a bathroom with only one or two existing solid colors, you may want something livelier, like a patterned, colorful shower curtain, to act as a focal point to the room. A white shower curtain can create a peaceful, calming feeling and also give off a clean and welcoming vibe.</p> <p>When remodeling a bathroom, you can look for the “perfect” neutral or decorative shower curtain and have fun designing the entire theme around that idea.</p> <h3>Additional Features</h3> <p>Some shower curtains offer additional features like pockets that face the inside or the outside of the tub for storing shower and other bathroom essentials. Just keep in mind the overall weight of the items if the rod isn’t bolted into the wall.</p> <p>Other features include a detachable and waterproof lining that comes with the curtain, so you don’t need to buy a separate one. Extra-wide shower curtains are beneficial for oddly shaped bathtubs or showers or when looking for a curtain for a soaking tub.</p> <h3>Hardware</h3> <p>A shower curtain hangs from the rod using hooks or hookless grommets. Hooks are the most traditional and popular method of hanging and are available in various metal finishes as well as plastic. Metal is the more durable choice; opt for aluminum, stainless steel, or brass, which are the least susceptible to rust.</p> <p>Hookless shower curtains are quicker to install using grommets that simply snap open and shut around the rod. Unlike metal or plastic hooks, these grommets also slide across the rod more smoothly, creating less noise.</p>",757
12,bidet,"<p>We combed through dozens of the top products available to compile our list of the best bidets. During our in-depth research, we evaluated the design and usefulness of each option to make sure we recommended products that adhered to criteria that matter.</p> <p>Some of our top considerations include:</p> <ul><li>Ease of use: Use of every bidet on our list is quite intuitive. Even our more luxurious picks have a clear and comprehensive remote or side panel for easy control.</li><li>Lifespan: Some bidets can be very pricey, so we selected products with longevity to make dollars stretch further and get more years of use out of your investment.</li><li>Brand: We only chose products from reputable companies. We prefer brands that have decades of experience making bidets in a North American market.</li><li>Design execution and bidet features: We understand that some households only require a simple bidet, while others want all the bells and whistles. For simple bidet seats and attachments, we selected products that do simple design well and without cutting corners.</li></ul>",167
13,toilet seat,"<p>The recommendations for the best toilet seats include a variety of options that meet the range of needs required by typical users who need a toilet seat for elongated or round toilets. When evaluating the products on the market, we looked for toilet seats that are made well and can withstand regular use. Other important factors that narrowed the field of possible toilet seats include ease of cleaning, comfort, ease of installation, color options, and additional features like heated seats, massage streams, drying features, water temperature control, a quiet-closing feature, and built-in bidet systems.</p> <p>Our favorite models include both wood and plastic seats that are easy to install and resist staining. Some offer the helpful feature of a quick-release seat, which makes cleaning much easier. Both low-tech affordable toilet seats and a high-tech bidet toilet seat with advanced features ranked high on the list. While most are standard sizes, one of the favorites is for higher weight capacities.</p>",158
14,shower faucet,"<p>We researched the most sought-after shower faucets in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, flow rate, size, number of handles, materials and finishes, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best shower faucets available, the most popular types among users were the panel and single-tap mixers with water pressures of 1.4 to 5 GPM. Most come with rain shower heads, handheld shower heads, or standard shower heads. These picks are available in small and large sizes to suit your shower space, with 1 to 3 handles for adjusting nozzles, handheld showerheads, and standard showerheads.</p> <p>These shower faucets also come in various materials and finishes including matte black, gold, nickel, chrome, stainless steel, and bronze. Some of these models also have pressure-balancing systems, a shower hose, digital LED screens, holders and handles, and rough-in valves.</p>",147
15,shower filter,"<p>We researched the most sought-after shower filters in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, filtration effectiveness and stages, materials, ease of installation, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best shower filters available, the most popular types among users were the KDF, vitamin C, showerhead, in-line, or showerhead/in-line combo options with 1- to 15-stage water filtration. While each of our top picks is made for certain contaminants, most are capable of removing chlorine, fluoride, heavy metals, dirt, odors, hard water, rust, sand, and more, protecting dry skin, hair, and nails. Select picks can also regulate the pH levels and bacteria of shower water.</p> <p>Most of these filters are made with durable stainless steel, ABS plastic, or chrome and have standard fittings that install easily into your current shower or shower head. Some of these picks also come in multiple finishes, provide water-saving features, and don’t hold back water pressure.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Shower Filter</h2> <p>Disinfectants in our water supply kill microbes and bacteria that could make you sick, but those disinfectants come with some risks. They can interact with naturally occurring organic compounds found in water and create what’s called disinfection by-products, or DBPs.</p> <p>There’s a limit as to how much can be in the water supply—about 50 to 100 parts per million (ppm). Small quantities probably won’t cause damage, but large amounts pose real risks. That’s why some people just don’t want DBPs in their water at all.</p> <p>Exposure to DBPs and other contaminants through water is especially intense. They can get into the lungs and skin. The steam that billows out of the shower is full of tiny particles. Since the lungs have such a large surface area, they can grab up these tiny particles from the air during and even after a shower. (In that respect, a shower filter can even improve the air quality in your home.) The pores in skin—the body’s largest organ—also soak up water. A shower exposes skin to between 10 and 20 gallons of water, which is far more than anyone could possibly drink in a day.</p> <p>Research published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology suggests that unfiltered bath water, especially hard water, may contribute to dry skin, hair loss, and nail problems. The best shower filter for your water supply can help.</p> <ul><li>The best shower filters help remove remaining DBPs and other contaminants from shower water.</li><li>Filtered shower water may improve the health of dry skin, hair, and nails.</li><li>Shower filters can improve the air quality in your home.</li></ul>",431
16,toilet flush valve,"<p>For those that want to implement water-saving hardware, need an update for your existing toilet flush pump, or need to repair the pump you currently have, many of the top picks above are reliable and versatile options.</p> <p>After researching the key qualities that should be included in a toilet flush valve, each of the options above caters to whatever kind of toilet you currently have in your home and some even have special features for personal preferences.</p> <p>Many of the options above also come with repair kits and hardware to ensure your new flush valve lasts. Finally, many of the options above have water-saving features for a lower ecological footprint, are made with durable hardware, and come with installation manuals.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Toilet Flush Valve</h2> <p>The flush valve is one of the most important parts of your toilet because it prevents the continuous flow of water into the toilet bowl. By stopping the flow of water after the toilet has been flushed, the valve prevents excess water from being used. A faulty toilet flush valve will allow water to continue to seep through, costing you money in water bills.</p> <p>A faulty flush valve can also cause water to intermittently turn on to fill the tank, leading to an ongoing flowing water sound that can be a real nuisance. What’s more, replacing the faulty fill valve means the toilet won’t have to work as hard, lessening ongoing wear and tear and potentially extending the life of the entire toilet.</p> <ul><li>With a new toilet flush valve, you can reduce water consumption and save money.</li><li>A replacement toilet flush valve will make your toilet quieter, allowing you to live in your home in peace.</li><li>Replacing a faulty toilet flush valve can extend the life of your toilet.</li></ul> <h2>Toilet Flush Valve Replacement Guide </h2> <p>A toilet flush valve is likely to wear out faster than the toilet itself. So if the time comes when you must replace it, consider the following installation guidelines, but always refer to the manufacturer’s recommendations for specific product differences.</p> <p>1. Empty the toilet and remove the toilet flush valve</p> <ul><li>Turn off the water supply feeding the toilet using the shut-off valve located at the back of the toilet. Flush to drain the bulk of the water from the tank.</li><li>Use a sponge or cloth to soak up the remaining water from the tank so you can work with a dry tank.</li><li>Disconnect the water supply hose and the flapper, making sure to disconnect the flapper chain from the overflow tube.</li><li>Loosen the nuts underneath until the top of the tank can be lifted off the base, and remove the thick rubber seal from the bottom of the tank.</li><li>Loosen and remove the plastic nut on the bottom of the toilet flush valve so you can take the flush valve out of the toilet tank.</li><li>Clean the hole where the flush valve was sitting and the area around it with a basic noncorrosive bathroom cleaning solution and cloth to remove leftover debris.</li></ul> <p>2. Replace the toilet flush valve.</p> <ul><li>Replace the rubber seal in the base of the toilet. Ensure that it forms a complete seal in the bottom of the toilet to prevent leaks by inspecting the edges of the seal to ensure it is sitting flat against the porcelain without gaps or spacing.</li><li>Connect the new valve in the same way the old valve was installed, ensuring that the toilet flush valve is positioned correctly and the plastic nut is tightened adequately.</li><li>Return the tank to its position on the base of the toilet, and tighten the bowl-to-tank nuts so the tank is secure and sitting in the correct orientation.</li><li>Adjust the length of the chain on the flapper to the correct level—there should be a little slack in the chain to allow the flapper to close.</li><li>Connect the chain to the overflow tube and the flapper to the toilet flush valve.</li><li>Finally, reconnect the water-supply hose and get ready for the first leak test.</li></ul> <p>3. Test the new toilet flush valve.</p> <ul><li>Once the new toilet flush valve is in place, turn on the water at the toilet’s shut off valve and allow the toilet tank to fill up.</li><li>Check the bottom of the tank for leaks using a flashlight and some paper towels, which will quickly show whether any moisture is leaking from the tank.</li><li>Once the tank is full, listen for the sound of water leaking through the seal, or wait to see whether the tank will begin filling again on its own. These are both signs that the flush valve has not been replaced correctly.</li><li>If a leak occurs or the valve is passing water into the toilet bowl, then repeat Steps 1 to 3, ensuring that the valve is positioned correctly and tightened adequately before testing again.</li></ul>",790
17,toilet paper,"<p>Buying toilet paper that meets your needs can make a big difference when it comes to environmental impact as well as your home septic system. Selections for the best toilet paper on the market depended upon thickness, quantity, septic compatibility, and environmental impact.</p> <p>Many of these picks come in varying quantities to satisfy large or small households, from 6-packs to 36-packs. Thickness being the biggest aid of comfort while in use, the above options vary between 1 and 3-ply thickness for your personal preference. This also aids in the type of septic system you have to avoid clogging or damage.</p> <p>Some of these choices are also compatible with RVs, boats, and composting toilets for the safety of smaller septic systems. Plus, with recycled, bamboo, quick-dissolve, and other sustainable toilet paper options, the environmental impact of these picks is minimal.</p>",139
18,shower squeegee,"<p>While a squeegee seems like a relatively straightforward cleaning tool for around the house, there is a deceptively wide range of features that shoppers may wish to consider before purchasing one. Our extensive list of options come with a range of useful features, including varying blade lengths and storage options, to suit a variety of user preferences. We also made sure to include several picks made from different materials, from soft and lightweight silicone to durable stainless steel.</p> <p>We found longevity to be an issue with some squeegees on the market, so those on our list of recommendations are made from durable materials, and most even have the ability to replace the rubber blade to keep your squeegee in top condition for several years.</p>",124
19,shower curtain rod,"<p>The best shower curtain rods are easy to install—and stay there without constantly slipping. They are made from durable materials and come in the right finishes to match existing fixtures and the bathroom decor. Our list of top picks covers the main types of shower curtain rods for shoppers and offers a range of options in terms of shape, material, and type of installation.</p> <p>We made sure to include plenty of products with adjustable rods since shower areas come in a multitude of sizes, so most of our recommendations are able to cater to most sizes. All of our top picks are also available in at least two finishes to match the most common bathroom fixture finishes including chrome, nickel, brass, black, and more.</p> <p>In our research we also made sure to look at installation and materials to round up a range of products made from high-quality materials that are also easy to install, with options for tension rods as well as more permanent mounted rods.</p>",166
20,soap scum remover,"<p>We researched the most sought-after soap scum removers in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their ingredients, compatibility with multiple surfaces, form, certifications, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best soap scum removers available, we included concentrates, sprays, and cleaning pads that are capable of removing mold and mildew, calcium, calcium carbonate, iron, rust, stains, scum, limestone, magnesium, and even grout stains. While most of these cleaning products have chemical-based formulas that include bleach and surfactants, select picks are made with all-natural ingredients like citric acid.</p> <p>These ingredients are all safe to use on bathroom and kitchen areas that are made of stainless steel, fiberglass, acrylic, ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, glass, porcelain, chrome, and other bathroom surfaces. Plus, many of these products are safe to use in homes with children and pets, leave fresh scents behind, and have been certified by the EPA, the Environmental Working Group, and the USDA.</p>",162
21,shower drain hair catcher,"<p>We researched the most sought-after shower drain hair catchers in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, materials, compatibility with different drains, and special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best shower drain hair catchers available, the screen-style options were most popular among users for their versatility, ease of use, and easy clean-up. While not as popular, in-drain hair catchers are also a viable option for those that prefer a heavy-duty catcher. The above picks are made with durable materials like silicone and metal, designed for multiple drain sizes and shapes.</p> <p>Most of the leading picks can accommodate 1.4- to 2-inch drains, while others work with drains of 4.75- to 6.25-inch diameters, making many of these catchers suitable for shower, bathtub, and kitchen sink drains.

23,toilet paper holder,"<p>When choosing bathroom fixtures, the humble toilet paper holder is easy to overlook. But it’s important to find the right pick that blends nicely with your bathroom decor and is comfortable to use on a daily basis. Through extensive product research, we chose the best toilet paper holders according to a few straightforward but necessary features: ease of installation, durability, and style.</p> <p>A toilet paper holder shouldn’t be hard to install, so we chose products that include instructions and mounting hardware. Most products on this list are made of metal, a durable option that is worth the minor splurge. And since you’ll look at your toilet paper holder every day, we also made sure to choose products that are simple and stylish to suit most bathrooms.</p>",126
24,towel warmer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after towel warmers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, style and size, capacity, ease of installation and use, as well as other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best options available, the most popular type of towel warmer among users were the electric models for their ease of use and installation. While not as popular, the hydronic models are also viable for their effectiveness and ability to heat the bathroom if needed. To fit in a variety of bathroom sizes and designs, our featured picks include bucket, rack, and cabinet-style towel warmers that reach temperatures of 122 to 176 degrees Fahrenheit.</p> <p>Most racks are capable of fitting at least 1 bath-sized towel or multiple washcloths, while others can hold up to 3 bath-sized towels, a bathrobe, clothing, or a blanket. For ease of installation, many of these units simply need to be placed on a bathroom floor and plugged in or wall-mounted to save space.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning A Towel Warmer</h2> <p>With the best hot towel warmer, you’ll always have a warm towel for a spa-like experience. More practical than a dryer, towel warmers keep towels warm just steps from your shower. These appliances add a luxurious last step to your shower routine, especially during fall and winter. Beyond keeping your towel toasty warm, a heated towel rack also helps towels dry faster, which keeps them cleaner for longer and reduces odor, bacteria, and mildewing that can come with dampness.</p> <p>Best of all, the right towel warmer aids in a range of tasks. A freestanding warmer can gently dry delicate items or swimwear or warm clothes, bathrobes, and bedding. Use one in a mudroom to heat gloves, socks, or coats; in a laundry room to dry delicate items; or in the bedroom to make blankets extra cozy before bed. In short, a towel warmer is a worthy addition to your home for the following reasons:</p> <ul><li>A towel warmer can help dry bath linens more quickly and keep them free of mildew and foul odors, too.</li><li>A quality warmer can go beyond the bath: Use a warmer in the laundry room for delicate items you’d rather not put in the dryer or in the pool house for drying wet swimsuits. You can also use it to warm robes and bedding to a cozy temperature.</li><li>There’s something incredibly posh about using a warm, fresh towel every time you step out of the shower or bath.</li></ul>",419

We researched the top bathroom lighting brands and vanity designs with high customer satisfaction and positive testimonials.</p> <p>We gathered our top picks in a range of styles to match several popular bathroom looks—from glamorous modern with sleek chrome finishes to antique brass for a vintage aesthetic. Naturally, since we’re talking about bathroom lighting, the recommended products also feature a degree of moisture resistance and should comfortably stand up to the occasional splash.</p> <p>Shoppers differ in terms of their preferred color temperature and brightness for their bulbs, so we made sure to include options for a wide variety of bulb types, colors, and brightness levels—many of our top picks are also dimmable.</p>",139
27,light bulbs for bathroom,"<p>The best light bulbs for a bathroom can provide enough illumination for users as they go about their business, casting a pleasant color temperature that is not too harsh, yellow, or blinding. Our list of recommendations features a wide range of styles, shapes, brightnesses, and color temperatures to suit multiple style choices. We made sure to provide options for shoppers looking for simple no-frills lighting with dimming capabilities for added convenience. We also included high-tech options for those looking to upgrade their home to function with their smart-home devices such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home.</p> <p>We’re aware that energy efficiency is always high on the list of priorities for shoppers, so our top picks all boast excellent energy saving characteristics.

29,toilet paper for septic,"<p>Toilet paper is a surprisingly varied product that, when comparing brands, will feel almost completely different from one roll to another. Our research looked at the best options in the market for toilet paper specifically designed to dissolve more quickly than the ultra-thick, almost towel-like options that some shoppers gravitate towards. For delicate septic systems that don’t fare well with clogs or blockages from 3- or 4- ply rolls, shoppers need to consider sacrificing some softness and thickness for a product that will dissolve quickly and avoid clogging.</p> <p>Our list of recommendations gathers the top products in this category, offering a range of choices that are suitable for RVs, boats, camping, and other delicate septic systems. We made sure to include both 1- and 2- ply options, depending on how much users are willing to sacrifice comfort for dissolvability. We also included options for family-sized packs with up to 36 rolls, as well as smaller packs for those with less storage space.</p>",162
30,vanity mirrors with lights,"<p>Years of experience covering home products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 40 lighted mirror options and weighed a number of practical considerations before choosing our recommendations.</p> <p>While there are mirrors on the market that require incandescent or fluorescent light bulbs, we focused on models that use LED bulbs because of their energy efficiency and ability to mimic different lighting conditions. Most high-quality lighted vanity mirrors include dimmable lights, allowing the user to operate them at full brightness to create the effects of bright natural or artificial lighting, or dim them as needed.</p> <p>The best lighted mirror for applying makeup allows the user to control the color temperature of the bulbs. Color temperature is measured in Kelvins (K), with higher numbers (in the 6,000K range) mimicking cool daylight and lower numbers (around 3,000K) creating a warm candlelight effect.</p> <p>Some of the lighted mirrors making this list offer smart features, like phone charging, which might be important to a user’s morning routine. Anti-fog properties also are good features to consider when selecting a bathroom mirror with lights.</p>",185
31,soap subscription boxes,"<p>Through product research and perusing consumer reviews, we chose a variety of soap subscription boxes that deliver high-quality products.The selected subscription services all have characteristics that set them apart from products typically available at stores, such as handmade craftsmanship, unique scents, eco-friendly practices, or niche items for a specific audience.</p> <p>Across the board, we looked for subscription boxes that offer a satisfying user experience. We selected subscriptions with a straightforward ordering and cancellation process and clear pricing structure so subscribers know exactly what they’re getting into.</p> <p>An attractive, easy-to-navigate website and inviting packaging were also considered since for many shoppers, subscription boxes are just as much about the experience as the products. Sustainable practices were also a plus that earned some subscription boxes a spot on this list.</p>",128
32,walk in tubs,"<p>We used several criteria when selecting models for our list of the best walk-in bathtubs. Considering that the most important feature of a walk-in tub is accessibility, we chose models designed for easier entering and exiting, including low door thresholds, wide doorways, and multiple grab bars. Sitting for many minutes while waiting for the tub to fill and empty can be tedious and uncomfortable, so we opted for models with fast-fill faucets and power drains. We also favored units with spa features such as whirlpool and air jets for massage. While cost was not a major factor, we looked for models with reasonable prices for the features provided and sought to include a range that includes affordable basic models as well as walk-in tubs loaded with high-end accoutrements.</p>",128
33,bamboo toilet paper,"<p>The average person uses around three rolls of toilet paper per week. This habit creates a lot of waste, so what you wipe with matters. When choosing the best bamboo toilet paper, the primary considerations we looked for were eco-friendliness and user experience.</p> <p>Through extensive product research, we chose bamboo toilet paper products that make a good effort toward sustainability through better manufacturing processes (including less chemical use, closed-loop systems, and sustainable farming practices). A third-party certification, such as FSC certification, earned brands a place on our list.</p> <p>It’s hard to switch to a more sustainable toilet paper if it’s scratchy and thin, so we prioritized brands with excellent user reviews that mention comfort. Shoppers have a range of concerns, so we chose a variety of toilet paper types, from organic to septic-safe products, to cater to different consumers.</p>",139
34,shower benches,"<p>It’s important to choose a high-quality and durable shower bench, designed with safety in mind. When choosing the best shower benches, the main criteria we looked for was a well-made and functional design.</p> <p>Features we looked for included adequate drainage and waterproof or very water-resistant materials that are easy to clean. While some benches feature simpler, more stylish designs, we also included options on this list with additional safety features, like handles, removable backrests, and transfer seating.</p> <p>For many, a shower bench is a necessity, so we included several affordable options on this list. Others choose a shower bench to upgrade their shower routine. Since style is important for these shoppers, we also kept aesthetics in mind, choosing several attractive and modern options that are a far cry from a medical shower seat.</p>",133
35,water saving shower head,"<p>The best water-saving showerheads save on the bills while not skimping too much on water pressure. No one wants a disappointing shower that can’t provide a relaxing blast of water. As such, we have gathered our top picks in this category to provide shoppers with a range of options to choose from according to their preferences.</p> <p>When curating our list of recommendations, we looked at showerhead types—such as fixed, handheld, and combination heads—and suggested our top picks in each category, which will ensure users get the best experience, no matter what type of head they’re looking for.</p> <p>We made sure that our list includes only products that boast high-quality and durable materials, are easy to install and maintain, and have the ability to both save water and still provide a decent shower experience.</p>",133
36,raised toilet seats,"<p>We chose these products by weighing design, comfort, and ease of use. Because an elevated toilet seat is something that gets used every day, the main considerations aside from safety are stability and comfort. Other factors we considered were how easy or difficult they are to install, how portable they are, and how sturdy or durable they are.</p> <p>For people recovering from injuries, or those who have mobility issues, a raised toilet seat can provide privacy, dignity, and independence. Not only do you want to avoid falls, but you want to remain independent as long as possible when caring for yourself. Toilet seat risers with cushions, handles, and anti-slip coatings are all things that can increase safety and confidence while maintaining privacy for the user.</p> <h2>Tips for Installing Raised Toilet Seats</h2> <p>While many raised toilet seats don’t require tools for installation, removing your old toilet seat might. Having a screwdriver and an adjustable wrench handy is a good idea for DIY installation. Making sure that you have the right size going in is also something that will save you time and aggravation. Most toilet seat risers aren’t returnable for health and safety reasons, so once you buy it, it’s yours. The shape of most American residential toilets is either standard, which has a round bowl, or elongated, which is more of an oval shape. If you’re not sure, it’s a good idea to ask the manufacturer or retailer for exact measurements.</p> <p>An important safety tip is to make sure all the hardware is properly installed and tightened. Read the directions that come with the raised toilet seat to make sure that everything will be securely attached. If the seat shifts or slips off the toilet, it doesn’t help create a safer bathroom.</p> <ul><li>Measure carefully before you buy</li><li>Keep a wrench and screwdriver handy</li><li>Follow all the manufacturer instructions</li></ul>",306
37,whirlpool tubs,"<p>Purchasing and installing a whirlpool tub may be a big investment, so shoppers will want to choose the best fixture for their space. To suit different bathrooms, we selected a range of whirlpool-tub types, including a stylish freestanding tub, a roomy two-person version, and even a walk-in option for those with mobility issues.</p> <p>Among all the different types, we looked for a few key features: attractive design; comfortable shape; and effective, adjustable jets. We also paid attention to materials, choosing durable options that should last upwards of a decade. For extra comfort and relaxation, we prioritized whirlpool tubs with additional features, like safer nonslip floors, ambient lighting, air bath jets, and extra-comfortable seating.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Whirlpool Tub </h2> <p>Whirlpool tubs share many of the same benefits as an outdoor hot tub. Soaking in warm water delivers a variety of physical and mental benefits, relaxing muscles while helping users unwind mentally for both tension and stress relief. The addition of massaging jets in a whirlpool tub greatly enhances the therapeutic experience. Reducing stress and muscle tension can have positive impacts down the line, including better sleep, improved exercise recovery, and pain relief.</p> <p>The best jetted tub options bring all these benefits home, making it easy to access this relaxation from the coziness of the bathroom. This proximity is appealing for those who don’t have the space or resources to install an outdoor hot tub—or who simply prefer an indoor experience. Unlike a hot tub, a whirlpool tub doubles as a practical bathtub, making it an even more appealing choice. In short, a whirlpool tub can provide the following benefits:</p> <ul><li>Muscle-tension relief</li><li>Stress relief</li><li>Easier access than a hot tub</li><li>Practical and luxurious</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Installing and Maintaining Whirlpool Tubs </h2> <p>Many whirlpool tubs are designed to fit in the same space as a standard tub, making them almost as easy as installing a standard tub. For homeowners looking to upgrade to a whirlpool tub, the procedure is similar. Start by taking accurate measurements of the bathroom, making sure to note the appropriate tub type, drain and plumbing location, and suitable electrical receptacle to power the pump. Consult a contractor, especially for heavier tubs, to ensure that the bathroom floor can support the weight of the new tub. Installing a whirlpool tub is usually a job best left to the professionals due to the plumbing and wiring expertise required.</p> <p>Since they’re a jetted tub with an internal pipe system, whirlpool tubs require more maintenance than standard tubs. It’s important to clean the tub frequently to prevent mold and mildew in the pipes. Most times, the tub itself can be cleaned like a regular bathtub. Consult the manufacturer’s directions for the process and frequency for cleaning the jets and interior piping.</p> <ul><li>Measure accurately and consider the suitable tub type.</li><li>Ensure the bathroom structure can support the weight of a whirlpool tub.</li><li>Professional installation is often recommended.</li><li>Whirlpool tubs need frequent cleaning.</li><li>Follow the maintenance schedule and process recommended by the manufacturer.</li></ul>",492

While all of the above top picks are effective at cleaning the interior of a toilet, each also requires limited labor or maintenance to work correctly whether they are chemical-based or 100-percent natural.</p> <p>Whether getting hands-on in the cleaning process or allowing the product to work for you, this list provides options that disinfect and deodorize while tackling limescale, soap scum, rust, stains, hard water deposits, and calcium based on your cleaning needs. Finally, the toilet cleaners listed above come with scents including lemongrass and citrus, ocean mist, tea tree and peppermint, and rain clean.</p>",149

Wet mopping and dry vacuuming models or just wet mopping options are the most popular models available as many come with carpet-sensing technology that increases suction and water tanks for marble, tiled, or hardwood floors. Plus, they can cover 200 to 2,580 square feet.</p> <p>Long runtimes are also prioritized in this list as most of these robot mops can clean for 75 minutes to over 3 hours. As for special features, some models are compatible with Alexa and Google Home or have a remote control, have programmed cleaning schedules and spaces, and voice activation.</p>",175
52,mop,"<p>With an array of models on the market, the best mop for you depends on your cleaning tasks and personal preference. Many of the above picks were selected for materials used, mophead type, ease of use, and their special features.</p> <p>The above list prioritizes variety when it comes to mop types. Sponge mops are the go-to for heavy-duty jobs and scrubbing. A flat mop and cleaning pad are more suitable for light-duty jobs and everyday upkeep, especially hose models with integrated spray functions. Meanwhile, steam mops disinfect floor surfaces while they clean and usually come with reusable and machine-washable pads.</p> <p>If you’re willing to pay more, a vacuum mop or iRobot mop offers high-tech features that make cleaning a breeze such as smart home compatibility and an automatic turn-on feature. Some of the above picks also come with LED lights for visibility and cleaning solutions for their built-in reservoirs.</p>",149
53,laminate flooring,"<p>We researched the most sought-after laminate flooring options in their respective categories and discovered that the best picks are determined by their AC rating, dimensions, number of finishes offered, ease of installation, and other special features included by the best laminate flooring brands.</p> <p>The above list prioritized quality while finding the best laminate floors, which is why our picks have AC ratings of AC3 to AC4 and each option has an ideal thickness, length, and width. While some options run thin at 7 to 10 millimeters thick for low-traffic areas, most come with 12 millimeter thicknesses which provide durability in high-traffic zones and absorb sound.</p> <p>To match your home and personal preference, each laminate flooring option comes with a range of finishes, most with individual textures per plank, and have click-in technology for easy installation. To ensure this list includes the best options, we also ensured that the majority of our selection were waterproof and stain, dent, scuff, scratch-resistant.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Laminate Flooring</h2> <p>Although traditional hardwood flooring certainly has its appeal, there are quite a few advantages of choosing laminate floors. Because laminate flooring consists of pressed wood that resists dents, scratches, and moisture, it’s more durable than standard hardwood. Some laminates are even waterproof, allowing you to use this product in areas that may get wet such as laundry rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms.</p> <p>Laminate flooring is also easy to clean with a broom and a damp mop and there’s no need to buy special wax or other floor cleaning products.</p> <p>Laminate flooring is significantly cheaper than hardwood flooring and easier to install. Most wood floors cost between $12 and $20 per square foot installed, compared to $2 to $8 a square foot to install laminate flooring, according to FIXR.</p> <ul><li>Laminate flooring is resistant to dents and scratches.</li><li>Some laminate flooring is waterproof, making it a good pick for bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms.</li><li>Laminate floors are easy to clean.</li><li>Laminate flooring is significantly cheaper than hardwood flooring.</li></ul>",327
54,vacuum for tile floors,"<p>What makes a vacuum great? In the end, the best vacuum is one that meets the needs of the user, and vacuuming a tile floor calls for some different qualities than vacuuming a deep-pile carpet. We started by examining basic features that all users could compare, including the suction and filtration of the vacuums along with the capacity of the dirt collection component. While cordless is more convenient, we found that in general corded vacuums are more powerful for longer—but a longer cord makes vacuuming an easier task than it would be with a shorter cord. We also took noise level and unique or individual features into consideration when choosing the best overall vacuum for tile floors. However, each user’s needs are different, so we evaluated multifunctional tools and special features so that each user can choose the tool that best handles their vacuuming chores.</p>",145
55,vacuum for stairs,"<p>The best vacuum cleaners for stairs can reduce the amount of dust, allergens, and pet hair on wooden or carpeted staircases. Selections for the best vacuum for stairs depended upon type, adjustability, wattage, attachments included, filtration type, and other special features included.</p> <p>The above list includes stick, handheld, or combination vacuum types to satisfy your preferences or be compatible with your space. Each of these models also come with adjustable speeds, wattages, wands, and spinning brushes depending upon how much power and precision you require.</p> <p>Attachments included with these vacuums also include crevice tools, pet hair brushes, dusting brushes to tackle small spaces and specific dirt types. Plus, some of the above stick vacuums come with wall mounts for storage.</p> <p>For those with allergies, HEPA filtration is also integrated in select vacuums to catch dust and particles. Large dust bins and canisters are also included, with some options offering easy dust and dirt ejection buttons. Finally, many of the above top picks are cordless vacuums that are lightweight and battery-powered for ample portability.</p>",173
56,spin mops,"<p>A high-quality spin mop can make cleaning messes and mopping floors more convenient. When selecting the best spin mops, user-friendliness was our top priority. Along with ease of use, we also looked at material durability, prioritizing spin mops made with high-quality plastic and rust resistant and durable stainless steel parts.</p> <p>Through extensive product research and considering shopper reviews, we chose spin mops that are intuitive and comfortable to dunk and wring using a sturdy hand-wringing mechanism or foot pedal—the less bending or fiddling with the mop, the better.</p> <p>Additional ease-of-use features scored a spin mop extra points. Some features we looked for included wheeled buckets, 180- or 360-degree mop-head maneuverability, and inclusion of a bucket drain hole, a splash guard, or a mop head agitator. We included several spin mops with these extra features to offer more bang for your buck.</p>",141
57,laminate underlayment,"<p>We researched the most sought-after underlayments for laminate floors in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, thermal rating, thickness, sound absorption, compatibility with multiple surfaces and floor types, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best laminate underlayments available, the most popular type among users was the standard foam for their versatility and affordability. While not as popular, the cork and combination options offer ample soundproofing capabilities, thermal insulation, and are easy to install. The featured options have 0.15 to 0.59 R-values and 2 mm to 6mm thicknesses for concrete and/or wood subflooring or floating floors.</p> <p>For ease of installation, the above underlayments come with built-in self-adhesive tape, ample square footage provided, built-in vapor and moisture barriers, as well as mold resistance.</p>",135
58,chair mat,"<p>We researched the most sought-after chair mats in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, compatibility with multiple surfaces, size, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best chair mats available, we found that the most popular types are plexiglass, polypropylene, tempered glass, polycarbonate, polyethylene, and PVC plastic. Each of these constructions provides ample durability to protect low-, medium-, and high-pile carpeting as well as vinyl, marble, and hardwood floors.</p> <p>For those offices that have carpeted floors, some of these options have cleats or studs built-in on the undersurface to keep them in place and smooth surfaces for easy rolling. Most of our picks also come in multiple sizes for small and large offices.</p>",126
59,lightweight vacuum,"<p>We researched the most sought-after lightweight vacuums and focused on tools produced by the top vacuum cleaner brands. Weight contributes to how easily a vacuum can be maneuvered and carried, with the featured picks ranging from light weights of 1 pound to 17 pounds.</p> <p>The favored options are stick and upright models since they cover larger surface areas easily. However, handheld and canister options are also included for smaller messes, stairs, or upholstery. Though most options are corded, the power cord on each tool is long enough to cover one to three rooms.</p> <p>While select lightweight vacuums are made purely for hardwood or carpets, many of the above picks can also be used on furniture, countertops, drapes, in cars, and on area rugs. Attachments like crevice tools, pet hair and spot cleaners, and dusting brushes are also included for hard-to-reach cleaning needs. Additionally, large dustbin capacities allow for less frequent emptying.</p>",151
60,mop for laminate floors,"<p>We researched the most sought-after mops for laminate floors in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, mop head material, ease of use, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best mops for laminate flooring, we found the most popular types among users were the spray, flat, spin, electric, and wet/dry combo options with microfiber pads. Many of these picks are suitable for laminate, but most can also be used on hardwood, tile, vinyl, ceramic, linoleum, stone, and other sealed hard floors.</p> <p>Though the majority of these picks do not have hands-free wringing mechanisms, select picks come with large mop heads, manual hand triggers, 180- to 360-degree mop heads, additional accessories or scrubbers, telescoping handles, and refillable bottles for ease of use.</p>",138
61,hardwood floor cleaner machine,"<p>Hardwood floor cleaning machines are able to get tough, stuck-on grime, grout haze, and dirt and select models can kill 99 percent of bacteria and germs. To narrow down the top hardwood floor cleaner machines on the market, we searched for functionality, ease of use, and versatility for a variety of cleaning tasks.</p> <p>Hardwood floor cleaner machines are made to be wet/dry mop and vacuums, steam mops, robotic vacuums, spin vacuums, and classic vacuums. While the wet/dry mop and vacuum and robotic models are convenient for those that need all-in-one cleaning, the steam mops and spin vacuums are meant for task-specific mopping or vacuuming.</p> <p>With this range in hardwood cleaning types and capabilities also comes added special features including disposable mop pads, dual-tank functionality, smart home connectivity, and even cleaning solutions and attachments for specific tasks.</p>",136
62,carpet cleaner for pets,"<p>The right carpet cleaner can lift pet stains and odors without the elbow grease of scrubbing or buying multiple cleaning solutions. We researched the most sought-after carpet cleaners in their respective categories and discovered that the best options include high power outputs, multiple cleaning modes and attachments, and easy-to-use features.</p> <p>The above carpet cleaners include upright models for cleaning whole spaces or large carpets, handheld options for small spaces, and portable models for stairs or spot cleaning. Each corded or cordless option offers powerful wattages or battery life with most ranging from 800 to 1,500 watts of power.</p> <p>As for tackling your pet’s worst messes, attachments like brushes and power tools with multiple layers of bristles, steam cleaning, heated drying, and automatic cleaning are included in select carpet cleaners listed above. Included cleaning solution and dual or singular water tanks also aid in odor removal and easy aftercare.</p>",148
63,vinyl plank flooring,"<p>I am something of a DIY enthusiast, and vinyl planks are one of my favorite flooring systems. I have used them in numerous locations, so I have a good understanding of their structure and how to install them. This, combined with extensive product research, resulted in the following selection criteria.</p> <p>Composition: The various materials used to make vinyl flooring are clearly an important component. When selecting these top picks, we made sure that each was fully waterproof, not just water resistant.</p> <p>Brand: Nobody wants to be re-laying flooring every few years. All the best vinyl plank picks come from manufacturers with an established reputation for excellent product quality and high durability.</p> <p>Value: Most vinyl plank flooring is affordable. We nevertheless took into account a range of prices in order to offer solutions for every budget.</p> <div><div><noscript></noscript></div><p>Photo: homedepot.com</p></div> <h2>Tips for Installing Vinyl Plank Flooring</h2> <p>While some vinyl plank flooring has a peel-and-stick backing, and others need to be glued down, by far the most popular installation option is as a floating floor. When properly installed, the combined weight of the planks and the confines of the room prevent any floor movement. Each manufacturer should provide specific instructions on how to install their product, but the following gives good general guidance.</p> <ul><li>Although rigid-core vinyl plank flooring is relatively forgiving and can hide minor imperfections in the subfloor, those imperfections can become more obvious with flexible, glue-down LVP. In any case, it’s a good idea to make the subfloor as smooth and level as possible at the outset. Sweep or vacuum the floor before starting to clear up any dirt or grit.</li><li>For comfort while working, it is well worth investing in some good knee pads.</li><li>Decide which direction you want the vinyl planks to go; usually this is along the length of the room rather than the width. The click-lock edges are on the right, so you need to work from the left.</li><li>Remove baseboards if present. If an underlayment is being used, lay a strip across the entire length of the room. It doesn’t need to be glued; it will be held in place by the vinyl planks. Don’t add further strips until you’ve nearly covered it with planks. If you try to do it all at once, it just gets in the way.</li><li>Take a few boards from a pack and practice interlocking them in the middle of the room with plenty of space around you, so you understand how they work before you start laying for real.</li><li>It’s normal to lay in a “brickwork” pattern, so every other row needs to start with a half board. Cut as required. Retain the other half, which can often be used to finish on the right-hand wall. The “tongue” of the plank should be laid against the wall so the grooves that interlock are facing you as you work backward.</li><li>When you reach the far wall, it may be necessary to reduce the width of the planks.Don’t try to make them a tight fit against the wall; leave a small gap to allow for the floor settling. Actual gap size should be recommended by the manufacturer.</li></ul>",518
64,engineered wood flooring,"<p>We researched the most sought-after engineered wood floors in their respective categories and discovered that the best choices are determined by their veneer thickness and offered finishes, core layer, ease of installation, and other special features included by the top brands.</p> <p>To ensure our options are versatile and last for years to come, we featured engineered wood floors with veneer wear layers of 1.2 to 3 millimeters that have an aluminum oxide coating for durability. Almost all of the options also come in multiple colorways to match your current space and have sturdy plywood, lumber, or fiberboard cores. As for how to install engineered hardwood flooring, most options come with an easy lock-and-click design or require nailing and gluing to stay in place.</p> <p>Depending on the look you want for your floors, the above picks vary in plank lengths between irregular and long for an authentic, real wood floor aesthetic or a clean, modern style.</p>",155
65,peel and stick floor tile,"<p>In selecting the best products for this lineup, we looked at dozens of peel and stick flooring options to determine which products were likely to offer the best results. We looked at individual tile thickness—in general—vinyl tiles should be around 0.2 to 0.5 mm thick to ensure they wear well and form a durable flooring surface.</p> <p>We also looked at pattern and design, and we opted for tiles that would complement a wide range of interior design styles. We avoided fad-type tiles that came with loud colors or non-traditional patterns because they can be dated nearly as quickly as installed. Instead, we opted for tiles that would stand the test of time and serve as a visual backdrop for all types of furniture.</p> <p>We also looked at customer satisfaction—good quality tiles equal happy customers. While everyone has their own design style, and no two homes are identical, most DIYers agree that they want good products at reasonable prices. Our lineup has something for everyone.</p>",164
66,water based polyurethane for floors,"<p>We researched the most sought-after water-based polyurethanes for floors in their respective categories. We discovered that the best options are determined by their coverage, finishes, ease of application, curing time, and the other special features included with top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best water-based polyurethane for floors, the most popular products among users provided 62 to 600 square feet of coverage areas in matte, flat, ultra-flat, crystal clear, semi-gloss, and gloss finishes. Moreover, our top picks are easy to apply with a brush, roller, or staining pad.</p> <p>While most of these top products require multiple coats, each has a fast curing time of 2 to 24 hours (although one takes 7 days to fully cure) for a scratch-, abrasion-, and scuff-resistant finish, even in high-traffic areas. Plus, select picks are safe for indoor/outdoor use, contain UV blockers, are no-odor or low-VOC formulas, or are eco-friendly.</p>",146
67,robot vacuums for hardwood floors,"<p>Modern robot vacuums have become more affordable and more reliable—there’s never been a better time to try one of these dirt-banishing machines. We researched dozens of robot vacuums and scrutinized product specs to find the best picks for hardwood floors.</p> <p>When it comes to cleaning, every home has different needs. To cater to a variety of shoppers, we included different vacuums to suit a range of common desires, like picking up after pets or dual-purpose vacuuming and mopping.</p> <p>We looked at the vacuum design, runtime, capacity, and additional convenience features, like mapping capabilities, cleaning modes, smart connectivity, and more to find well-rounded and practical vacuums. Each product on this list has a standout feature that sets it apart from the rest and makes it a worthwhile buy, whether it’s excellent battery life or a super-slim design.</p> <p>There are a lot of robot vacuums on the market today. To ensure reliable picks, we chose options from reputable brands like Roomba and Roborock that have built their own brand authority. These brands have gained consumer trust due to their focus on research and innovating new products, so you know their products are intentionally designed and reliable.</p>",194
68,garage floor tiles,"<p>In selecting the floor tiles for our list, we considered several important factors. Since a floor tile needs to hold up to extreme conditions, durability ranked high. With that in mind, we only chose floor tiles that could endure the weight of a vehicle as well as the heavy machinery and tools one would commonly find in a home workshop. Garage tiles also need to resist staining from water, oil, gas, and other chemicals that might come into contact with them, so we only chose products that were water resistant. Installation was also key. We chose floor tiles that are easy to install and require no special tools or expertise. Since the cost of garage floor tile can vary considerably, we selected options that suit a variety of budgets.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Garage Floor Tiles</h2> <p>Garage floor tiles improve both the form and the function of a standard cement garage floor. They create a finished look that makes a garage more inviting to spend time in, whether tinkering under the hood of a car or constructing a set of shelving. In addition to improving the aesthetics of a garage, floor tiling can also make a garage safer by adding tread that improves the traction on the floor, preventing slips and falls that can lead to injury. Foam and rubber floor tiles add a layer of cushioning that prevents damage to the floor or to a tool should it fall off a tool bench or slip out of one’s hand. These softer floor materials can also make long hours working in the garage easier on feet and knees.</p> <ul><li>Improves aesthetics</li><li>Adds traction</li><li>Certain types add a layer of cushioning</li><li>Protects the garage floor from damage</li></ul>",284
69,underlayments for vinyl plank flooring,"<p>Years of experience covering home improvement as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 underlayment options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: The best underlayment depends largely on the type of flooring used and the subfloor present. Because of that, we included underlayments made from a variety of materials in order to offer options for most shoppers.</li><li>Thickness: Though thickness isn’t necessarily an indicator of quality when it comes to underlayments, we still opted to only include models with a minimum thickness of 2 millimeters.</li><li>Versatility: We prioritized recommending underlayments that offered a combination of moisture protection, thermal insulation, and sound insulation.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Installing Underlayments for Vinyl Plank Flooring </h2> <p>Now that you’ve chosen the perfect underlayment to pair with your vinyl plank floors, it’s time to consider installation. Most products will come with clear manufacturer instructions, and it’s essential to follow these as closely as possible to ensure the product is installed correctly. Here’s how to install underlayment for vinyl plank flooring:</p> <ul><li>Follow the manufacturer’s instructions</li><li>Clean the subfloor thoroughly</li><li>Lay out the underlayment from wall to wall, cutting pieces to fit</li><li>Ensure there are no gaps between pieces</li><li>Use an adhesive to connect the various pieces</li></ul>",206
70,floor scrubber,"<p>When shopping for a floor scrubber, it helps to consider floor type and choose the best scrubber for your flooring. Most of the scrubbers on this list can clean multiple floor surfaces. We also analyzed a scrubber’s power to note whether it was corded electric, cordless, or manual, and included some of each.</p> <p>We also looked at scrubbing action. Those who want to use their scrubber often but on easy messes might look for different scrubbing features than they would for the heavy grime and large floor surfaces that the professional scrubber from Oreck can tackle. We considered a scrubber’s maneuverability as well, since the mops need to reach into corners and under or around furniture. Finally, we noted helpful accessories, like included mop pads.</p>",125
71,moth repellents,"<p>Finding moths in the closet or pantry can be an annoying and sometimes costly discovery. The best moth repellents can help protect cherished clothing and pantry staples from these destructive critters. When choosing the best moth repellent, we considered effectiveness, ease of use, scent, and affordability. We included both moth-repellent and moth-killer products since they go hand in hand, catching small problems before they become a big issue and banishing infestations.</p> <p>Through extensive product research, we considered materials and formulations, only choosing products that contain ingredients with proven efficacy. We also paid attention to the application method, selecting products that were straightforward to use.</p> <p>Since closets and pantries are used daily, we made sure to include plenty of natural choices without harsh scents. Lastly, replacing moth-affected items can already be expensive enough, so we kept value in mind when choosing our top products, looking for affordable or reusable products.</p> <h2>Tips for Moth Prevention and Elimination </h2> <p>There are two ways that moths can wreak havoc in a home: They can leave holes in clothes or munch on dry goods in pantries. Since the closet and the kitchen are two different environments, there are different ways to prevent and eliminate moths in each area.</p> <p>As is the case with many other pests, keeping your home clean can make a difference. Cleaning closets and pantries decreases the amount of dust and grime, which can draw moths in, and gets rid of any possible larvae or adult moths that hitch a ride on clothes or in food. In both the closet and the pantry, using moth repellents can help make these areas less attractive to moths. Products with lavender, mint, or cedar repellents can help repel moths—they don’t enjoy the smell of these fragrant items.</p> <p>To prevent pantry moths, store dry pantry staples in containers with airtight seals. Unfortunately, if moths do make their way into the pantry, it’s necessary to dispose of nonairtight containers and do a deep clean to get rid of pantry moths. Using airtight containers can prevent moths from getting into the food in the first place and reduce the amount that needs to be tossed if moths do find a way in.</p> <p>Use moth-repellent products to prevent closet moths. For moth-prone homes, clothes can also be stored in airtight containers. If clothes show signs of moths (like small holes in the fabric), clean the closet, wash clothes in hot water, dry using high heat, and freeze unwashable items for at least 24 hours to kill off any larvae.</p> <p>For stubborn moth infestations, consider contacting a pest control service; the professionals should be able to treat a problem that keeps coming back.</p> <p>In short, to prevent or eliminate moths:</p> <ul><li>Keep closets and pantries clean</li><li>Regularly check closets and pantries for signs of moths</li><li>Store items in airtight containers</li><li>Use moth-repellent products to dissuade moths from settling in</li><li>If moths keep coming back, consider hiring a pest control service</li></ul>",484
72,rechargeable batteries,"<p>In making selections for our list of the best rechargeable batteries, we considered a variety of criteria. Among the most important is that rechargeable batteries need to provide ample power, extending the time between recharging. With that in mind, we chose AA batteries with at least a 2,000-mAh rating.</p> <p>One should be able to recharge a rechargeable battery hundreds of times before it will no longer hold a charge, so we stuck with models with a long lifespan. Since batteries often spend a significant time in storage before they are needed, we also favored those rechargeable batteries that could retain the majority of their charge while sitting in a drawer or closet for a year or more. Finally, we considered price. A rechargeable battery can help mitigate AA and AAA battery replacement cost, so we chose those that offered tangible savings over disposable batteries.</p> <h2>Our Top Picks</h2> <p>The following list includes some of the best rechargeable batteries. They are among the most popular and widely used for a variety of electronics because these rechargeable batteries are high quality and priced competitively. Many brands with excellent options for AA sizes offer some of the best rechargeable AAA batteries, too.</p> <article><header><h4>Best AA<div></div></h4><div><div>1</div><h3>  Panasonic Battery Charger Pack with 4 AA Batteries </h3></div></header> <div><div><noscript></noscript></div></div> <div>Photo: amazon.com</div><div> Check Latest Price</div><section><p> The highly regarded eneloop battery may have switched manufacturers—Panasonic instead of Sanyo makes these batteries now—but nothing has changed when it comes to their superior performance.

Those looking for a more affordable option may want to consider Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries, which provide great performance at a budget price.</p> <h2>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Rechargeable Batteries</h2> <p>You’re likely familiar with the range of battery sizes available, as a number of gadgets still require batteries. Battery nomenclature—how they are named and organized—is complex, but the letters on batteries also indicate their size. (For example, AA means 50.5 mm by 14.5 mm.) But the letters aren’t the only labels to look for when shopping for rechargeable replacements. Before switching to rechargeable batteries, pay attention to these additional four features.</p> <h3>Chemistry</h3> <p>There are four main types of rechargeable batteries for home use that differ in terms of the chemicals that produce their charge: nickel cadmium (NiCD or NiCaD), alkaline, lithium-ion, and nickel metal hydride (NiMH). Each has its strengths and is useful for different purposes.</p> <p>If picking up a couple of varieties for different uses around the house, be careful not to confuse them. Never mix batteries of different chemistries in the same device.</p> <ul><li>NiCD batteries are often used in power tools.</li><li>Alkaline batteries are the best batteries for regularly used, low- to mid-drain electronics, like digital clocks and remote controls.</li><li>Lithium-ion batteries are designed for smart technologies (phones and laptops) and solar panels as they can withstand extreme temperatures.</li><li>NiMH rechargeable batteries are the most common variety for household uses. They have a high energy capacity (see below) and are excellent for high-energy electronics like flashlights, toys, and digital cameras.</li></ul> <h3>Capacity</h3> <p>A battery’s energy capacity describes its electric power over time and is measured in milliamp hours (mAh). The higher the mAh, the longer a battery will last. Disposable NiMH AA batteries have an mAh range between 1,200 to 1,900. In comparison, rechargeable NiMH AA batteries have an mAh range between 1,700 and 2,500. Do not mix batteries of different capacities within the same device, or else one will drain faster than another and negatively affect performance.</p> <p>There is also a difference in capacity with AAA versus AA batteries. While most AAA batteries will have around 900 mAh, most AA batteries have around a 2,500 mAh capacity. The longest-lasting rechargeable batteries have capacities as high as 2,800 mAh.</p> <h3>Charge Time</h3> <p>The amount of time it takes for a battery to charge depends on its capacity (mAh). Fast-charging NiMH AA batteries can take 3 to 4 hours to charge fully. When purchasing new rechargeable batteries, they should come charged and ready to use.</p> <p>Another important factor is the length of time a battery can hold a charge. Quality rechargeable batteries can hold 75 to 90 percent of their total charge for up to a year in storage.</p> <h3>Lifespan</h3> <p>A rechargeable battery’s lifespan is measured in the number of recharges it can cycle through. The best rechargeables on the market boast between 500 and 2,000 recharges per battery.</p> <p>Be aware that NiMH batteries offer fewer recharges than some of the other types of batteries. However, they also need to be recharged less often, so they still typically last longer.</p> <h3>Charger</h3> <p>Rechargeable batteries use a charger to refresh them once they’ve been drained. These chargers range in capacity from as few as four batteries to as many as 40. They also vary in sophistication. Most models have indicator lights that change color when the batteries are fully recharged. More advanced chargers provide more detailed info, allowing the user to see exactly how much juice is remaining in a battery.</p> <p>A quality charger will also switch to a trickle mode when the battery nears a full charge to prevent damaging the battery and ensure it charges fully. More advanced chargers allow the user to set different charge rates, refresh batteries by discharging and recharging them, and test the battery capacity.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Rechargeable Batteries</h2> <p>There are several ways to get the most out of your rechargeable batteries while extending their lifespan. First and foremost, don’t be chintzy on the charger. A “smart” charger will charge your batteries without undercharging them or overcharging them. Avoid using super-fast chargers, which can overheat batteries, decreasing their lifespan from 500 charges to fewer than 100.</p> <p>Don’t leave your batteries in the charger for more than 24 hours to avoid damaging them. When a battery in a device is drained, remove it from the device immediately or make sure the device is off. A device that continues to drain a discharged battery could reverse its polarity, causing it to stop working. Be patient with new rechargeable batteries, as it can take three to five charge cycles for them to reach their full capacity.</p> <ul><li>Use a quality charger</li><li>Do not use a fast charger</li><li>Avoid leaving batteries in a charger for more than 24 hours</li><li>Be patient with new batteries</li></ul>",2419
73,grout removal tool,"<p>For the purpose of finding the top grout removal tools available by reputable manufacturers and sellers, it was necessary to research each potential option thoroughly in order to determine which tools were the best for removing tile grout.</p> <p>The variety of tools that can be used to remove grout made it easy to find potential products, but difficult to narrow them down. To help choose the top tool it was necessary to consider the weight of the tool, whether it comes with a blade, the type of blade, the type of tool, and the suitability of the tool for grout removal.</p> <p>Preference was given to lightweight products that came with one or more grout removal blades. Stainless steel blades were acceptable, but products with carbide or tungsten steel blades stood out from competitors. In addition, a product was dropped from consideration if there was any indication that the tool would be unable to adequately remove grout.</p>",156
74,pocket knife,"<p>To put together this list of the top pocket knives, it was necessary to research over 40 different products, each with benefits and drawbacks that were important to note and fully understand before the best options could be selected. During the selection process, several key factors needed to be considered, including the blade material, blade length, knife length, locking mechanism, blade shape, weight, balance, and purpose.</p> <p>Stainless steel and carbon steel blades are equally effective, though stainless steel is the preferred material for wet environments, while carbon steel tends to remain sharp for a longer period of time. The length of the blade and the length of the knife were relatively consistent across most products. This was to be expected because the best folding knife has a short closed length allowing it to slide easily into a pocket or purse where it can be retrieved quickly in case of emergency. However, non-folding knives can be just as useful. Just make sure that the knife has a decent sleeve or holster to safely carry the knife without damaging yourself or the blade.</p>",181
75,jump starter with air compressor,"<p>As we researched the market of jump starters with air compressors, we gathered our top picks and showcased each recommendation based on their standout features for certain categories. Users looking for high power output have plenty of options available on our list, as well as those who have heavy-duty tires to maintain. We made sure to include options for a range of budgets too, with impressive upgrade picks for those looking to splash out on a power house unit, to more budget-friendly options for occasional users.</p> <p>All of our picks come from reputable brands and each model comes in a relatively lightweight and portable frame, usually with a carry handle. Utility was an important factor for us to consider, so we made sure that all of our recommendations include multiple outlets for charging devices, from USB ports to actual 12-volt outlets that power almost any device.</p>",146
76,hand trucks,"<p>Many of us have used a hand truck at one time or another, such as when moving to a new house, helping friends move, or transporting supplies for work. However, while personal experiences are certainly valuable, they seldom give a full picture of the available products on the market. The Bob Vila team researched leading manufacturers and their products, looking at materials technology and taking into account the feedback from large numbers of buyers.</p> <p>In order for our top picks to be helpful to as many people as possible, we established which were the most popular categories and then searched for the best solution within that group. This involved looking at weight capacity, ease of use, durability, and value for money. These aren’t necessarily direct comparisons. A folding hand cart can’t be expected to have the same handling ability as a heavy-duty hand truck. However, each should have a capacity appropriate to the expectations of the particular use. The results represent some of the best hand trucks for the widest range of needs.</p>",173
77,outdoor light bulbs,"<p>When selecting the light bulbs for this guide, we considered the most important factors: brightness, energy efficiency, and durability. For an outdoor light bulb to be effective, it must be bright enough to provide adequate illumination for the driveway, patio, front porch, or whatever is tasked with lighting. With this in mind, we stuck with bulbs that produced at least 700 lumens for entryway lights and at least 1,200 lumens for floodlights. The one exception was our entry for decorative lighting.</p> <p>Since energy efficiency is paramount these days, we eschewed incandescent bulbs entirely, instead sticking mainly to highly efficient LED bulbs. LED bulbs also last much longer compared to incandescent bulbs—about 50,000 hours versus 1,200 hours. Although LED bulbs are significantly more expensive, they make up for that cost difference with a lower electric bill (they’re about 90 percent more efficient than incandescent bulbs) and longer lifespan, often lasting many years longer than an incandescent bulb.</p>",156
78,paint stripper,"<p>A good paint stripper is one of the easiest ways to remove paint and varnish to prep an old piece of furniture or other material for refinishing or painting. When gathering our top picks for paint stripper, we paid attention to what types of coatings each product will remove as well as its compatibility with metal, wood, plastic, and other types of materials. Our list of recommendations features a wide range of products to suit a variety of requirements, from the ability to remove multiple paint layers to avoiding harsh chemical odors for sensitive indoor applications.</p> <p>We also made sure to consider the active ingredients used in the strippers we recommend. As such, we chose mostly green products that don’t use harsh chemicals such as methylene chloride or NMP, which are toxic to humans and harmful to the environment.</p>",139
79,grout sealer,"<p>The best grout sealer is easy to apply, leaves no strong and lingering odors after application, and lasts for several years. Our research looked at several aspects to find the top picks on the market, including cement-based and epoxy-based options to suit shoppers’ needs.</p> <p>We also made sure to include a range of options in terms of how the grout sealer is applied; from simple spray bottles for non-penetrating solutions that provide moisture and stain protection, to more heavy-duty products that provide a penetrating protection against a range of issues like mold, humidity and heavy stains. We even included an option for shoppers to tackle spot maintenance of their white-colored sealer with a handy pen.</p> <p>In terms of price points, our research helped us gather a range of products to meet a variety of budgets. So whether you’re looking for a quick fix or a long-lasting solution, our list of recommendations can cater to both preferences.</p>",156
80,rust remover,"<p>We spent several days on research before arriving at the selections above. It was important to understand the variety of products available and how the different kinds of rust remover work.</p> <p>Where possible, we tried to select environmentally friendly products that are as safe to use as possible, though in some cases, we had to step outside those boundaries. What we have done is make a representative selection across the market and have included relevant information so buyers can use their own judgment.</p> <p>Value is another important consideration. While rust removers aren’t particularly expensive, overall cost depends on the area of rust that needs to be treated. Balanced against this has to be convenience. Aerosol rust converters are more expensive, but they are quick and easy to use. We also stuck with well-known brands that have a proven track record.</p>",140
81,concrete cleaner,"<p>We researched the most sought-after concrete cleaners in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by the type of stains they can resolve, cleaner type, compatibility with multiple surfaces, form, working time, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>To satisfy a range of preferences, we included liquid and dry options that have pH neutral, alkaline, peroxide, microbe, sodium hypochlorite, and water-based formulas to tackle a variety of stains and surfaces. Though each cleaner is formulated for specific stains, many of these concrete cleaners work on oil, dirt, mold, mildew, grime, moss, algae, and grease stains immediately or within a few weeks.</p> <p>While these cleaners are more than capable of cleaning concrete, many are also capable of being used on stone, wood, composite, metals, brick, fabric, and many more. For added convenience, some of these cleaners do not need to be scrubbed to work effectively, while others may require a pressure washer, sponge, or mop. Finally, some of these top products are recognized by the USDA and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Safer Choice Program certified.</p>",180
82,ash vacuum,"<p>The best ash vacuum cleaners are the perfect fireplace tools to prevent excess soot, dust, and burnt materials from cluttering up your flue, hearth, and its surrounding area. Selections for the best ash vacuums depended upon motor power, cord and hose length, portability, tank size, and versatility.</p> <p>Each of the above picks has ample suction power for excess ash and dust with 4 to 10-amp motors. There is also an impressive range of cord and hose lengths to maneuver small or large fireplaces or spaces, most having at least 30 to 50-inches of cleaning reach. For portability and maneuvering, many of the above picks are lightweight and compact. For those that do have large, heavyweight constructions, built-in wheels and handles are included.</p> <p>As for storage of the ash collected, the tank sizes of the above models range from 2-16 gallons for small or large cleaning needs. For added convenience, many of these models also double as handheld vacuums, or detachable blowers, while others have drainage ports and/or wet/dry capability to be used for sawdust, leaves, or dirt.</p>",177
83,tower fan,"<p>We researched the most sought-after tower fans in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, airflow capabilities, functionality, size, ease of use, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best options available, the floor-standing tower fans were the most popular type among users for their ample airflow capabilities. While not as popular, the bladeless, desktop/portable, and smart fans are viable options for their ease of use, safety features, and airflow settings.</p> <p>To ensure our list included the best options on the market, we included fans with high cfm ratings of 720 to 1,271 and additional functions including oscillation, air purification, ionization, and heating capabilities. Many models are compact enough to fit on a desk, while others take up little space in corners or next to furniture. For added convenience, many of these fans have LED/LCD screens; remote controls; are compatible with apps, smartphones, and tablets; have automatic timers and sleep modes; and are lightweight enough to move or transport if needed.</p>",173
84,bike repair stand,"<p>Choosing the best bike repair stands for this list took a multi-angled approach. First, as a mountain biker, I leaned on my experience, looking for features that were important to riders and mechanics (such as adjustability and weight capacity). Also, a universal clamp that could handle a variety of bike styles was critical.</p> <p>Beyond the features, I considered materials, design, and affordability. Some models might not have all the features or the most advanced design, but they do offer quite a bit of value. Others might have everything anyone could ask for but might tip the affordability scale just a bit.</p> <p>With all that in mind, I put this list together by balancing those specifications and features. The result is a list full of high-quality products with something for bikers of all varieties.</p>",133
85,heated socks,"<p>After consulting numerous expert sources online and carefully perusing the product descriptions for 16 options, we assembled our list of recommendations for the best electric heated socks. We focused on the best rechargeable heated socks, as the convenience of rechargeable batteries contributes to the value of the heating socks. Battery life and remote control features came to the forefront of our investigation as well.</p> <p>Additionally, we considered the materials that go into the battery-heated socks. We gave preference to products made from stretchy, breathable, and moisture-wicking materials, as these qualities contribute to comfort. We also considered the durability of electric socks with extra built-in padding, as these provide comfort for the wearer over longer periods of time.</p> <h2>Safety Tips for Using the Best Heated Socks </h2> <p>It’s wise to consider safety when using any electric-powered products. Therefore, people may wonder if it’s safe to wear heated socks that are battery powered.</p> <p>Heated socks are designed to be worn safely, even when wet. A waterproof membrane separates the heating-element wires, making them safe to wear while damp. However, the socks should never be submerged in water while in operation.</p> <p>Always remove the batteries before laundering heated socks. Some manufacturers indicate that their heated socks are machine washable and others recommend the socks be washed by hand.</p> <p>When recharging the batteries for heated socks, always use the charger that came with the product. The lithium-ion batteries could overheat, melt, or ignite if they are charged with a charger other than the one included by the manufacturer with the purchase of the socks.</p> <ul><li>Do not submerge the socks in water while they’re operating.</li><li>Always remove the batteries before laundering the socks.</li><li>Use the charger that came with the socks.</li></ul>",283
86,yarn winders,"<p>We considered more than 25 products to narrow down the best yarn winders for most crafters. Through extensive product research, we found the best smooth-operating and sturdy options for knitters and crocheters.</p> <p>We looked at the winder design as well as shopper reviews and included winders that are easy to set up, pleasant to use, and reliable, paying mind to features such as easy-crank systems, simple directions, and nonslip and nonscratch clamp design. To ensure a durable construction, we prioritized winders from reputable brands.</p> <p>Since preferences can vary from user to user, we chose a range of yarn winder types, from compact to portable to heavy-duty to large-capacity. Lastly, a yarn winder shouldn’t break the bank, so we also paid attention to price when choosing the top yarn winders.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Yarn Winders </h2> <p>Although hand-winding yarn can be meditative, it’s hard to match the convenience of using a good yarn winder. Using a yarn winder is faster than hand-winding and easier on the hands and wrists. Yarn winders tend to create a more uniform yarn ball than hand-winding can, all with minimal effort.</p> <p>A yarn winder not only simplifies the winding task but also creates a center-pull yarn cake (where the yarn feeds from the center of the ball), which is one of the easiest yarn ball types for knitters to work with and keep organized. Since yarn winders are also affordable, with some options starting at around $20, they’re a must-have tool for crafters who frequently wind yarn.</p> <ul><li>Faster and easier than hand-winding</li><li>Places less strain on the hands and wrists</li><li>Creates a uniform yarn cake</li><li>Affordable</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using the Best Yarn Winders</h2> <p>Using most yarn winders is fairly straightforward. If the yarn winder has a table clamp, start by attaching it to the edge of a table. Placing a piece of cloth between the clamp and the table can help prevent damage (but make sure the fabric isn’t slippery). Pass the yarn through the feeder and attach it to the winder at the top of the spool. Once the end of the yarn is secure, it’s time to crank.</p> <p>It’s best to start slowly when winding the yarn to ensure it is winding correctly. Users can speed up the process as they get more comfortable, but should take care not to go too quickly to prevent the yarn from getting caught on any part of the winder. Use one hand to turn the crank and the other to control the tension of the yarn going into the feeder. Try not to tense the yarn too much: This can stretch out the yarn fibers and affect how the material performs when it’s time to knit or crochet.</p> <ul><li>Clamp the yarn winder securely to the side of a table; a nonslip layer can be used to ensure the clamp doesn’t damage the table.</li><li>Start slow and steady when winding the yarn.</li><li>Use one hand to crank and one hand to feed the yarn.</li><li>Make sure not to stretch the yarn too much while winding; too much tension can affect the performance of yarn.</li></ul>",510
87,silicone spray,"<p>We researched the best silicone spray lubricants in their respective categories and discovered that the top options are determined by their quantity, temperature resistance, drying time, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best silicone spray lubricant options available, we included products that come with ample 8.5- to 14.4-ounce quantities which last through multiple uses or projects on rubber, wood, vinyl, metal, plastics, glass, and fabrics. Many of these silicone lubricants are able to tackle high temperatures of up to 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit on hot appliances or vehicles, while select picks can be used to lubricate garage door components, doors, hinges, and household appliances.</p> <p>For added ease of use, these silicone lubricants dry immediately or take 24 hours to cure for long-term protection against moisture, rust, grime, dirt, and other debris. Plus, select picks are colorless, non-staining, odorless, and come with multiple spraying methods.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Silicone Spray</h2> <p>Spray lubricants are a great addition to the garage or workshop with many different applications. You can easily apply the spray to the surface you want to silence squeaky hinges, lubricate stuck metal parts, protect against rust, and prevent moisture damage. When you set out to apply silicone spray, keep these tips in mind:</p> <ul><li>Avoid spraying walking surfaces with silicone spray. The mist creates a slippery coating that can quickly become dangerous.</li><li>Do not use silicone spray on painted surfaces. The paint tends to absorb the spray, making it very difficult to apply a new coat of paint over the silicone-infused layer.</li><li>Focus the silicone spray on the mechanical parts. Even in the situation of loosening a lock on a car door handle, you won’t want the spray to coat where you grip, because it will make the surface slippery and hard to grasp. This is the case for any items you may need to handle― fishing rods, chainsaws, guns, and more―so that they do not slip out of your hand while using them.</li></ul>",330
88,epoxy resin,"<p>There are many different features to consider when selecting the best epoxy resins. However, the main factors that were explored during extensive product research include the curing time of the epoxy resin, durability factors like UV resistance and anti-yellowing, and the intended purpose or use of the product.</p> <p>Casting epoxy resin for jewelry, mold, and miniature creation isn’t necessarily subject to the same situations as coating epoxy resin, so these differences were taken into consideration when determining the suitability and functionality of the products.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Epoxy Resin</h2> <p>Epoxy resin can be used for a wide range of projects and, like paint, the drying, setting, and curing times of different products can vary.</p> <p>So, when you are trying out a new product for the first time, make sure to mix a small amount of the epoxy resin in order to determine how long it takes to dry to the touch, harden, and cure. This will help you avoid mistakes on the actual project.</p> <p>Also, make sure to store the epoxy resin at a moderate room temperature. If the epoxy resin gets too cold or dry it can hinder the adhesive ability of the product, while very high temperatures can prevent proper bonding.</p> <p>After applying one coat of epoxy resin, you may find that the finish isn’t thick enough or doesn’t have the right appearance. Check the manufacturer’s directions to find out how long the first coat should dry before a second coat is added.</p> <ul><li>Before starting, mix a small amount of epoxy resin to get a better idea of drying, setting, and curing times.</li><li>Store epoxy resin in a room-temperature location and avoid extremely cold or dry places.</li><li>Refer to the manufacturer’s directions to determine how long to wait before applying a second coat of epoxy resin.</li></ul>",296
89,car wax,"<p>We researched the most sought-after car waxes in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, ease of application, longevity, versatility, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While looking for the best car waxes on the market, we found that the carnauba and paste car wax options were among the most popular for their ease of application, longevity, and the convenience of having applicators or microfiber cloths included.

We also understand that ability levels can vary regarding assembly and installation, so we chose doors that were ready to hang out of the box and unfinished models that can be tailored to meet specific designs.</p> <p>We also included a mix of different styles to suit preferences, ranging from the classic rustic barn door to modern models with metal frames, glass panes, and mirrors. Size is critical with barn doors, so we leaned toward models that offer multiple size options to suit entryways of varying sizes. For doors that require assembly, we stuck with models that require minimal tools and time.</p>",139
124,rugs for dining rooms,"<p>With so many options on the market, shopping for dining room area rugs can feel like a big task. For many shoppers, style is a priority, so we chose a variety of attractive rugs that can fit with many interior design styles. Since rugs are often seen as a budget-friendly way to upgrade home flooring, we also stuck to affordable options with a few premium picks thrown into the mix.</p> <p>Beyond their looks, two key functional features were important for dining room rugs to make the list: easy-to-clean materials and a low to medium pile. We stuck to stain-resistant materials with a reasonably low pile to make sure the rugs can hold up to high-traffic and mess-prone dining rooms. We also mainly stuck to patterned rugs which tend to be the best option for dining rooms as they are better at concealing messes so the rug will look nicer for longer.</p>",151
125,entryway rugs,"<p>There are several features that are a must when it comes to entryway rugs, the most important being durability, ease of maintenance, and style. We kept these factors top of mind when evaluating candidates for the best rugs for entryway use, choosing lower-pile rugs made of resilient and easy-to-clean materials.</p> <p>Style is subjective, so we chose a variety of rug types, colors, and shapes, choosing rugs that look attractive and are high quality. We prioritized rugs with a decent size range as well, to make it easier to fit various foyer dimensions. Entryway rugs sometimes also need to be replaced because of dirt and foot traffic, so we made sure to include several budget-friendly options on this list.</p> <h2>How to Measure for Entryway Rugs</h2> <p>When it comes to styling a rug, sizing can be as important as the rug design. Before shopping for an entryway rug, it’s important to measure the foyer.</p> <p>Start by removing any objects that will get in the way of taking measurements. Use a measuring tape to measure the length and the width of the floor area in the entryway. The usual rule of thumb for area rug sizing is to keep 6 to 18 inches of bare floor around the rug. Use this guideline to determine the maximum size of your entryway rug.</p> <p>To further narrow entryway-rug options, shoppers should decide on a preferred look by considering how much flooring they want to show. Entryway rugs can range from a stylish indoor doormat to large area rugs. They can be placed under entryway furniture such as console tables and coat racks, or sit in the middle of the room. Also consider rug shape. Decide whether you want to match the foyer shape or go for an irregular design. In short, to measure for and choose an entryway rug:</p> <ul><li>Remove any obstacles.</li><li>Measure the room length and width to get the maximum area rug size.</li><li>Consider stylistic choices to narrow down your preferred rug size.</li><li>Remember to take room shape into account.</li></ul>",333
126,cabinet hardware,"<p>Style is one of the most important features shoppers look for in new cabinet hardware, so we put a lot of weight on aesthetics, choosing hardware that looks attractive and approachable to fit a wide range of homes and applications.</p> <p>Beyond looking nice, cabinet hardware should feel pleasant to use (you will use it every day, after all). Through product research and reading online reviews, we chose hardware that would feel comfortable in hand—no overly sharp corners or unfinished edges on this list.</p> <p>Switching up cabinet hardware is often taken on as a DIY project, so ease of installation was another important feature we considered. Each option on this list includes mounting hardware for easier installation, taking the hassle out of finding the right screws. We also looked for options where each piece is individually packaged. Although this uses a little more packaging, it greatly reduces scratches and dings in transit to make sure the hardware arrives ready to install.</p>",160
127,dishwasher cleaners,"<p>At minimum, a good dishwasher cleaner must offer better performance and convenience than traditional cleaning methods, like a cup of vinegar or a scrubbing sponge. To make sure the dishwasher cleaning products in our lineup were worth purchasing, we considered performance, ease of use, and value.</p> <p>We evaluated performance by researching each product’s ingredient list and dishwasher cleaner reviews. We chose products with an effective and safe combination of active ingredients. The ingredients work together to clean away main dishwasher concerns, including grime, food residue, limescale deposits, and hard-water stains.</p> <p>User-friendliness was another major criteria point, and we prioritized products that were very straightforward to use, including several that can be used in a regular dishwasher load. Last, we considered affordability. Keeping the dishwasher clean shouldn’t be expensive, and for even better value, we included a few bulk-size options.</p> <h2>Tips for Cleaning Dishwashers</h2> <p>A dishwasher-cleaning routine is key to maintaining appliance performance and longevity. Those looking for a shortcut may wonder: Can you use dish soap in the dishwasher? Absolutely not! Using dish soap will create a sudsy mess that will flow out of the machine. Plus, unlike dishwasher cleaners, regular dish soap and dishwasher detergents don’t have the ingredients to actually break down residue, so they’ll fail to clean the machine adequately.</p> <p>Instead, reach for a dishwasher cleaner, most of which are intended for once-a-month use. Follow the manufacturer’s directions, which usually involves running a full cycle using the hottest water temperature. Though dishwasher cleaners are powerful, they aren’t magical, so follow these tips to prepare the machine for cleaning.</p> <p>Remove any visible pieces of food from the tub and racks. Ideally, food bits should be cleaned at least a few times a week to keep odors at bay. At least once a week, and before and after using a dishwasher cleaner, empty and rinse the dishwasher filter as well.</p> <p>About once a week, clean the dishwasher exterior and any outside parts, including the gasket, the door, and the handle. Use hot, soapy water and a toothbrush or a paper towel to remove any gunk from the rubber seal. Warm, sudsy water or a gentle cleaner can be used to wipe down the door, control panel, and handle as needed.</p> <p>Even in the cleanest dishwashers, the water itself can leave unsightly spots on dishware. To tackle these aesthetic marks, these great dishwasher rinse aids will help.</p> <ul><li>Use a dishwasher cleaner monthly for interior cleaning.</li><li>Remove visible pieces of food frequently.</li><li>Empty and clean the filter at least once a week.</li><li>Clean the rubber door seal at least once a week.</li><li>Wipe down the door, control panel, and handle as needed.</li></ul>",437
128,oven cleaner,"<p>We researched the most sought-after oven cleaners in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are easy to use, take little time to work, can be used on multiple surfaces, and have additional special features included.</p> <p>Based on the above list, the best oven cleaners are chemical or natural sprays and foams which take little time to clean and can usually be used on oven racks, doors, and walls as well as cookware, broilers, and other kitchen appliances. Though not as popular, pastes and wipes are also an option as they are fast and efficient when it comes to spills and grease.</p> <p>No matter the type, most oven cleaners work on contact or take up to 40 minutes to break down grease and baked-on food residue. The best oven cleaners also emit no toxic fumes or leave a light lemon or lemongrass scent after use. For the eco-conscious consumer, some oven cleaners are even vegan and cruelty-free.</p>",159
129,granite sealer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after granite sealers in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, form, quantity, formula, ease of use, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best granite sealers available, the most popular types among users were the penetrative, enhancing, and topical granite sealers in spray, wax, or liquid form. These top picks come with enough quantity for multiple uses, many ranging from 18 ounces to 1 whole gallon. While some of these picks are made with chemical compounds, some picks are natural, water-based, and/or biodegradable making them safe for use near food, children, or pets.</p> <p>Plus, since many of our top picks have spray-on applications, most are easy to use and cure in under 34 hours. Finally, some of these top picks come with built-in cleaners, polishes, and sealers to prevent stains while repelling water and other liquids.</p>",153
130,offset smoker,"<p>Selecting the top offset smokers from a range of options was difficult, but with extensive research into each product, it was possible to put together this highly selective list of options. Before beginning the selection process, we determined the weight, portability, cooking area, material construction, and fuel type of each product.</p> <p>Weight and portability were linked since heavier grills become more difficult to manage, even when they are equipped with wheels. The cooking area averaged more than 500 square inches, though some products were highlighted because they sacrificed cooking area for a high level of portability. Other options had a much larger cooking area, making them ideal for large get-togethers, gatherings, and parties. Most of these offset smokers have powder-coated steel construction, though some products did use stainless steel as an alternative.</p> <p>It was also important to note the type of fuel, especially if the offset smoker used charcoal because the temperature of these grills needs to be manually controlled by adjusting intake and exhaust dampers. While some people have the experience necessary to work with charcoal offset smokers, they can be difficult for inexperienced users, so these products were not viewed as beginner-friendly.</p>",194
131,guide best refrigerators,"<p>Years of experience covering home care and appliances as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 40 options for the best refrigerators on the market and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <p>We included models with multiple fridge door configurations in varying sizes and capacities to provide options for a variety of shoppers. We prioritized fridges with desirable added features like built-in water and ice dispensers.</p> <h2>Tips for Using and Maintaining Your Refrigerator</h2> <p>Although refrigerators are one of the most frequently used appliances, many people don’t know how to properly use and maintain them. Use these tips to ensure your fridge operates at peak performance for as long as possible.</p> <ul><li>Monitor the temperature: The interior of a refrigerator should maintain a temperature between 37 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit to keep food fresh, while the freezer should stay at a consistent 0 degrees Fahrenheit.</li><li>Ensure the doors seal properly: Check the seals regularly and clean them twice a year to remove any dirt and residue.</li><li>Keep coils clean: If the coils at the back of a refrigerator are covered in dirt or dust, they can’t help it get rid of warm air.</li></ul>",200
132,garbage disposal,"<p>We researched the most sought-after garbage disposals in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, horsepower, materials, ease of installation, operation volume, and other special features included by the top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best garbage disposals on the market, the continuous feed models were unanimously the most popular among users for ease of use and consistent operation. Our featured garbage disposals range from ½ to 1.25 horsepower motors and have durable stainless steel and nylon constructions for a long lifespan and durability.</p> <p>Our top picks also have easy twist and lock, 3-bolt, or snap and lock installation and are compatible with existing assemblies. For added convenience, many of these garbage disposals have noise-deadening features, pre-installed power cords, and compatibility with septic systems and wall switches.</p>",134
133,cutting board,"<p>Years of experience covering home and kitchen products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 40 cutting board options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: We included various types of cutting boards in the guide because plastic, bamboo, marble, and wood boards all have advantages, and many cooks keep a board of each type on hand.</li><li>Versatility: For those with limited kitchen space, having a versatile cutting board is essential. Because of that, we largely recommended plastic, wood, and bamboo cutting boards, which work well for most kitchen tasks.</li><li>Value: Cutting boards vary widely in price, so we aimed to feature products that offered excellent value regardless of their material and price point.</li></ul>",125
134,under cabinet lighting,"<p>We performed hands-on testing of each product in this guide. We did so by closely following rubric and testing guidelines to help ensure each product met certain standards of quality and ease of use, as well as to keep our results fair and equitable. We looked at a variety of factors for testing, including the versatility of the light, the output each lighting set provided, whether the light was controllable (such as through a dimmer), and the ease of installation. We even looked at how easily the on/off switch or dimmer moved to produce the desired lighting result, as well as the warmness (or not) of the light, thus reflecting whether it was designed for task lighting, ambient lighting, or both.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Under-Cabinet Lighting</h2> <p>Installing under-cabinet lighting can lower energy bills by allowing you to use high-efficiency lights to illuminate one area at a time. This will provide more light for cooking and food prep while reducing the energy output of your lighting system. In addition to illuminating tasks such as food preparation on countertops, under-cabinet lighting can highlight a backsplash pattern that might otherwise be lost in shadow and/or enhance a mood—low brightness during dinner, for example, to create a relaxing atmosphere. Under-cabinet lighting can also enhance the home’s interior value by reducing shadows that make a room look small.</p> <ul><li>Under-cabinet lighting is an easy-to-install, affordable way to update a kitchen.</li><li>It can lower a home’s energy consumption and save money on the electric bill.</li><li>It enhances the home’s interior value by focusing on unique style points and reducing shadows.</li></ul>",261
135,electric grill,"<p>The best electric grills allow users to enjoy barbecue dishes like steak, burgers, and sausages in a unit that can be used outdoors when the sun is shining or indoors out of the rain. Users won’t have to worry about harmful fumes, like those produced by propane and charcoal grills, though an extension cord may be required to set up an outdoor electric grill.</p> <p>Our list of recommendations features several options across the wide range of electric grill types, offering our top picks for freestanding, tabletop, built-ins, smokers, and combos. Our top picks stand out from their competition in terms of quality construction, reliability, and ease of use—not to mention cleaning, which our research showed us is a vital part of a shopper’s consideration, since no one wants a grill that’s impossible to keep clean.</p> <p>Portability is also an important factor, so our picks cover the range of grill sizes while also making sure that each product can be moved from one place to another without great difficulty.</p>",168
136,deep fryer,"<p>Deep fryers take some getting used to, so one of the first considerations we made was the ease of use. We asked questions like, how easy is it to drain the oil? How long does it take to get the oil to temperature? Are there presets to help you find the right oil temperature?</p> <p>Our next consideration was if the fryer could heat the oil quickly and efficiently. A fryer should hold the temperature fairly well, even when users are putting the food into the oil.</p> <p>The final two considerations were oil capacity and cleaning ease. Some models cook only enough for two, while others make enough for a crowd. Deep fryers can be messy, so cleaning ease played a big role in which models made the list. Features like dishwasher-safe components and a removable basin got bonus points.</p>",139
137,counter depth refrigerator,"<p>We researched the most sought-after counter-depth refrigerators in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their size, type, finish, capacity, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While most counter-depth refrigerators must be under 37 inches to fit most counter widths, each of the above picks ranges from 31 to 36 inches in width to fit the average kitchen space. For their convenience and ergonomic designs, the french door and side-by-side are considered the favorite types of counter-depth refrigerators among users, all of which have stainless steel finishes.</p> <p>As for capacity, many of the above models have 20 to 22 cubic feet of interior space with adjustable shelving and additional drawers included. While searching for the best options available, we also featured a few counter-depth refrigerators with ice makers, water dispensers, touchscreens, door-in-door designs, and even smart connectivity for remote adjustability.</p>",147
138,water filter pitcher,"<p>While it’s easy to assume that all water filter pitchers offer similar performance, a number of factors affect their functionality. Several years of experience covering home goods and kitchen essentials as well as extensive product research went into choosing our final curated selection. We reviewed more than 25 water filter pitcher options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <p>We prioritized models that feature certifications from the NSF and ANSI to ensure their filtration claims were accurate. We aimed to include pitches of varying sizes to provide an option to suit most households. Preference was assigned to models that are compatible with long-lasting filters to reduce the frequency with which they must be replaced.</p> <h3>The Advantages of Owning a Water Filter Pitcher </h3> <p>Clean water is essential to your health. It’s recommended that the average person drinks at least eight glasses of water per day, and fresh-tasting water makes it easier to reach this goal. Fortunately, you don’t need to spend a lot of money on a whole-house water filtration system in order to have great tasting water. Instead, water pitcher filters make it convenient and affordable to have clean, healthy drinking water in your home.</p> <p>Water filter pitchers remove common contaminants found in tap water. They will also make tap water smell and taste better by removing the chlorine used to disinfect tap water. Best of all, water filter pitchers are portable and small enough to fit on countertops and most refrigerator shelves.</p> <ul><li>A water filter pitcher provides effective filtration of common contaminants found in tap water.</li><li>A water filter pitcher is a low-cost alternative to having a water filtration system in your home.</li><li>A water filter pitcher is easy to use, portable, and will not take up much countertop or refrigerator space.</li></ul> <h3>How To Change a Water Filter Cartridge</h3> <p>Water filters have a lifespan. How often you change the water filter depends on the level of contaminants in your tap water and how often you filter water. Changing a water filter is easy and takes only a few minutes when you follow these steps:</p> <ul><li>Open a new filter cartridge and soak it in a clean glass of water according to the manufacturer’s directions. This activates the filter media and removes any carbon dust.</li><li>After the soaking process, remove the filter from the water and allow excess water to drain.</li><li>Remove the old filter and insert the new one. Reset the filter change indicator or make a note on the calendar of the date you placed a new filter in your water pitcher.</li></ul> <h2>What Contaminants Does a Water Filter Pitcher Remove?</h2> <p>Officially, there are no federal regulations for water pitcher filters. However, most manufacturers follow the NSF/ANSI protocols to establish minimum requirements for the safety and performance of filters used in water pitchers.</p> <p>These are the main certification standards commonly used for residential water filtration systems and filters for water pitchers:</p> <h3>NSF/ANSI 42</h3> <p>Filters with NSF/ANSI 42 certification reduce specific aesthetic-related contaminants from your water that affect taste and odor, such as chlorine and chloramine, which is a group of chemical compounds that contain chlorine and ammonia. Chlorine and chloramine are added to drinking water for disinfection purposes. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the small amounts of chlorine and chloramine in drinking water do not cause harmful health effects. However, they can be unpleasant to smell and affect the water’s taste.</p> <h3>NSF/ANSI 53 </h3> <p>Filters with NSF/ANSI 53 certification remove health-related contaminants from water, such as lead, mercury, Cryptosporidium, VOCs, chromium, and more. Many carbon-based filters have this certification. It’s common to find water filters with both NSF/ANSI 42 and NSF/ANSI 53 certifications.</p> <h3>NSF/ANSI 401 </h3> <p>Filters with NSF/ANSI 401 certification remove incidental contaminants and emerging compounds. These contaminants are often pharmaceuticals or chemicals not yet regulated by the EPA. Some of these contaminants include over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen and pesticides like DEET that make their way into the public water system.</p> <h3>NSF/ANSI 244 and 231</h3> <p>Filters with NSF/ANSI 231/244 certification remove microbiological contaminants from water. These filters protect against intermittent microbiological contamination of safe drinking water, usually for water sources in remote areas or when there is accidental or irregular contamination of the municipal water supply. They use reverse osmosis or ceramic components to remove microbes, such as bacteria, yeast, mold, fungi, virus, prions, protozoa, and more. Most filters used in water filter pitchers hold NSF/ANSI 244/231 certifications.</p>",730
139,mini fridge,"<p>Extensive research into a wide number of mini fridge products, as well as significant time spent examining the top features of these products, helped to select the top mini fridges based on the size, capacity, type, style, and overall quality. Mini fridges fall into four categories that each have distinctive sizes, capacities, and styles, so it was necessary to inspect and find top options that could represent each type of mini fridge.</p> <p>The size and capacity of a product related directly to the installation of the mini fridge but also to the items that could be kept cool inside the mini fridge. The limitations of some models, like bulky exteriors or disorganized interiors, dropped their overall appeal to the average person, while some interesting style choices, like bright, vibrant colors or retro handle designs, helped other mini fridges stand out from the crowd. Our final consideration was the quality of the products; there is no point in having a fridge if it fails to keep the contents cool.</p>",168
140,over the range microwave,"<p>We researched the most sought-after over-the-range microwaves in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their size and capacity, wattage, ventilation, cooking settings, and other special features included by the top brands.</p> <p>While they are not suitable to use as countertop microwaves, each of the over-the-range microwaves included in our list is compact enough to fit into the average kitchen’s range while their capacities range from 1.1 to 2.2 cubic feet. Wattage between 950 and 1,100 also allows these models to cook veggies, popcorn, and full meals with the help of 300- to 400-cubic-feet-per-minute fans.</p> <p>Preset and customizable cooking options as well as sensor cooking technology allow for proper cooking, reheating, and defrosting. Plus, some over-the-range microwaves on this list have fingerprint-resistant finishes, voice control with Alexa and Google Assistant, child locks to keep small fingers safe, as well as removable racks for multiple food items to cook at a time.</p>",156
141,range hoods,"<p>For those who love to cook, adding an efficient range hood is one of the best upgrades you can make to a kitchen. Kitchens come in all shapes and sizes, and so do range hoods. To suit a variety of kitchen layouts and designs, we chose range hoods from several categories, so you can find an option whether you’re looking for a wall- or ceiling-mounted model. We also included a mix of ducted, ductless, and convertible options to suit different needs.</p> <p>Through extensive product research and reading consumer reviews, we chose efficient range hoods that are pleasant to use—which to us means reliable and reasonably quiet. We prioritized range hoods from trusted brands and included products at different price points to make sure there’s an option for any kitchen.</p>",129
142,kitchen sinks,"<p>We researched the most sought-after kitchen sinks in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their style, materials, mounting type, size, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While researching the best kitchen sink options, farmhouse or apron front-style models are among the most popular for their ergonomic design and durability. Though not as popular, the single and double basin sinks are also viable for their ample working space and they are easy to clean. Our top picks also vary between stainless steel and 16-gauge stainless steel, fireclay, granite quartz, and cast iron to accommodate your personal preference.</p> <p>Also featured is a selection of either top-mounted or undermount sinks with undermounts being more popular for their ease of installation. As for compatibility with your kitchen, most of the above picks have the perfect dimensions to fit into the average kitchen. Finally, in the interest of including the best options available, we selected picks that include additional cutting boards, soundproof capability, grids, drying racks, drain covers, and basket strainer sets.</p>",175
143,convection oven,"<p>We researched the most sought-after convection ovens in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their size, type, cooking settings, temperature range, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best options on the market, it appeared that portable convection ovens were the most popular among users for their ease of use, wide temperature ranges, and included features. While not as popular, the wall-mounted option included is large enough for bigger meals and reaches a higher temperature than the portable units. No matter the type, each of the above options is compact enough to fit in the average kitchen and comes with 7 or more cooking presets included.</p> <p>With most options ranging from roughly 120 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, some provide slightly lower or higher temperatures based on your cooking needs. In the interest of searching for the best convection ovens on the market, we also included picks that featured auto turn-on and shutoff, automatic temperature adjustment, additional accessories, rotisserie options, crumb trays, LED displays, and adjustable racks.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Convection Oven</h2> <p>The difference between convection ovens and regular ovens means that certain types of food do better in convection ovens than conventional ones: meat, vegetables, and anything that you cook covered works well in convection because of the even, consistent heat. Convection also speeds up the dehydration and toasting processes because the circulating air evaporates moisture.</p> <p>There are distinct advantages to owning a convection oven rather than a conventional model:</p> <ul><li>Food cooks faster in a convection oven.</li><li>The convection maintains a consistent temperature throughout the oven for more even cooking.</li><li>You don’t need to rotate trays and pans in a convection oven.</li><li>Convection saves energy because it cooks food faster at lower temperatures.</li><li>Convection crisps and browns food because it helps sugars dry and crystallize during the cooking process.</li></ul>",308
144,electric range,"<p>We considered several criteria to narrow the more than 20 electric ranges we reviewed down to the top models. Heating power is crucial for an electric range, so we chose models that can reach the higher heat levels needed to offer such features as power boil. Versatility is also important, so we leaned toward ranges with dual burners and fifth burners.</p> <p>Oven capacity determines a range’s ability to cook multiple dishes at once or large roasts and turkeys. With that in mind, we chose models with capacities of 5.3 cubic feet or more. Finally, we also chose models that offer premium cooking functions such as air-frying and convection baking and roasting. Finally, an electric oven should be easy to clean, so we stuck mainly with those that have self-cleaning functions.</p>",130
145,gas range,"<p>Having enough cooking space, burners, and temperature ranges in a gas range can make cooking small and large dinners faster and more convenient. Selections for the best gas ranges depended upon size, BTUs provided, number of burners, and other cooking features included in select models.</p> <p>Though freestanding models are the most popular on the above list, these options as well as the slide-in gas ranges come with 4 to 6 burners for cooking multiple foods at once. Both also offer ample oven space of up to 6 cubic feet which can hold multiple pots and baking sheets if necessary. As for temperature range, most models have at least 5,000 BTUs and the highest temperature offered is 21,000 BTUs.</p> <p>With high temperatures offered, select gas ranges also include fast preheating, included broilers, drip pans, and conversion capabilities to cook with either conventional or convection oven settings.For added convenience, some of these picks come with a steam and/or self-cleaning feature or a door lock for homes with small children. For exterior cleaning, most of the above models are made with stainless steel or porcelain for easy clean-up after cooking.</p>",187
146,water filter,"<p>To create our list of top-rated water filters, we looked at the wide range of options available on the market to provide a comprehensive list for shoppers to choose from. From simple pitchers that fit easily into the fridge to more permanent fixtures that install either on the counter, under the sink, or hook up to the water system for the entire house, our list of recommendations provides suitable options.</p> <p>When gathering our top picks, we looked at a range of water filter reviews to ensure we were only including reputable brands that use top-quality materials. Most of our picks use long-lasting filters that—depending on household water consumption—will need to be replaced anywhere from every 3 months up to an entire year.</p> <p>Our research also showed us that filtered water dispensers vary widely in terms of price. As such, we made sure to include both top-of-the-range filtration systems for shoppers looking for an upgrade and more budget-friendly options that provide clean filtered water without breaking the bank.</p>",167
147,electric can opener,"<p>The best electric can openers are a hassle-free way to open soup cans, dog food, and even soda cans without the hassle of hand-cranking. Many of the above picks were selected for their safety measures, cut type, design, size, and special features.</p> <p>With safety being the most important consideration for opening cans, each of these can openers ensures safe operation through one-touch or hands-free control. Many of the above picks also include magnetic lid lifters to safely dispose of sharp-edged lids and automatic shut-offs to avoid unnecessary cutting.</p> <p>The above selection predominantly incorporates stainless steel cutters for durability and long-term effectiveness. The size of the above picks is also a factor as many are small enough to store in your kitchen or do not take up ample counter space. Finally, some of the electric can openers above come with additional tools like bottle openers, knife sharpeners, and scissors for added convenience.</p> <h2>Our Top Picks</h2> <p>From countertop can openers to models that tuck into a drawer, one of the following picks may be the next handy addition to your kitchen.</p> <article><header><h4>Best Overall<div></div></h4><div><div>1</div><h3>  Hamilton Beach Smooth Touch Automatic Can Opener </h3></div></header> <div><div><noscript></noscript></div></div> <div>Photo: amazon.com</div><div> Check Latest Price</div><section><p> Here’s an electric can opener that handles most cans effectively and safely, and looks good while doing it.

This side-cut opener has the length to handle larger cans with a sleek finish that makes it attractive enough to leave on the counter. If you prefer a top-cut model, the Cuisinart Deluxe can opener is a great alternative with a magnetic lid lifter and lower price tag, but it doesn’t work with larger cans.</p> <h2>Types of Electric Can Openers</h2> <p>The first electric can openers debuted in the 1930s, but they didn’t catch on until improved versions appeared in the ‘60s. Today’s models have come a long way and primarily fit into two main categories: top-cut and side-cut openers.</p> <h3>Top Cut</h3> <p>The most common type of can opener, a top-cut model, features a sharp rotary wheel with a blade that cuts along the inside of the can’s top rim. This style of opener usually includes a magnet to hold the lid in place and keep it from falling into the can once it’s severed. While many cooks rely on this tried-and-true can opener style, it does leave a razor-sharp edge on the lid.</p> <h3>Side Cut</h3> <p>As a safer alternative to the top-cut can opener’s sharp lid, consider a side-cut model. It works by cutting away the lid just under its rim, resulting in a smooth edge that cannot cut your fingers. Unfortunately, side cut can openers don’t work on cans with reinforced rims that are designed to hold plastic lids, such as coffee cans.</p> <h2>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Electric Can Opener</h2> <p>All the best electric can openers are easy to use and won’t take up a lot of countertop space, but several different factors and features may make one type better suited to your kitchen and lifestyle.</p> <h3>Design </h3> <ul><li>Upright versions plug into a standard household outlet and are usually kept on the countertop, pushed toward the back until needed. If countertop real estate is at a premium, however, you might consider a handheld model. Upright electric can openers are available in both top-cut and side-cut models.</li><li>Handheld models are gaining in popularity because all you need to do is position the small device on the top edge of the can, push a button, and let it work its way around the can. Handheld models are most often battery operated, requiring either AA, AAA, or 9-volt batteries, although you can find an occasional plug-in model. Battery-operated, handheld electric can openers are easy to stow out of sight in a drawer. The downside to these devices is the chance that the battery could die right when you most need to use the opener, so consider keeping backup batteries on hand.</li></ul> <h3>Cutting Mechanism </h3> <p>Top-cut electric openers punch a hole in the top of the can and then cut away the lid with a sharp rotating blade. The can is held in place by the cutting mechanism itself through pressure. This works well for removing most standard can lids, but if a can is extra hefty, the opener may not be able to support its weight while cutting.</p> <p>The cutting mechanism on a side-cut model works similarly by attaching to the can’s rim and holding it securely while cutting around the side. Handheld models are more likely to feature side-cutting mechanisms, while upright openers are more likely to feature top-cutting mechanisms.</p> <h3>Durability </h3> <p>Electric openers come in various qualities, and parts on the least expensive ones may not be as durable as more expensive models made from higher-quality materials. For example, a stainless steel lever on an upright electric can opener will likely outlast a plastic lever on a similar type of opener. Handheld models have a reputation for not being quite as durable as uprights.</p> <h3>Ease of Use</h3> <p>The handles on some manual can openers can be difficult to hold, and the crank can be a challenge to twist. Electric can openers avoid these issues, making them well-suited for those who have arthritis and find a manual opener difficult.</p> <p>Many of today’s upright electric can openers come with an automatic shut-off that stops the cutting process when the lid is severed. This is a handy feature for busy cooks because they can stir a pot or take cookies out of the oven rather than monitor the progress of the can opener.</p> <h3>Special Features</h3> <p>Though all of the above features are important to the functionality of a can opener, some also include special additives to make your cooking process easier and efficient.</p> <ul><li>Lid lifters are incorporated in some upright can openers. This tool lifts the removed lid from the can after opening so it can be disposed of safely.</li><li>Automatic shut-off stops the cutting process once the can has been opened. Found mostly on top-cut, upright models, this feature ends cutting when complete for safety in homes with young children.</li><li>Additional kitchen tools like handheld can openers, bottle openers, multi-tools, knife sharpeners, and scissors are included on the body of the can opener or in attached compartments.</li></ul>",1809
148,meat tenderizers,"<p>When it came to selecting the top products, it was necessary to first examine many types of meat tenderizers and any specialized variations on these products. This ensured that we had a comprehensive idea of the available products within this category. Our knowledge was furthered through extensive research into individual products and helped to determine the best meat tenderizers within their given categories.</p> <p>Key factors that contributed to this selection included the type of meat tenderizer, the material each tenderizer was made from, the type and form of the handle, and whether the products had any features that made them stand out from similar products, like a unique dishwasher-safe design without any concern about premature material failure.</p> <p>In general, products that demonstrated a high degree of durability and reliability were considered top options, given that repeatedly hitting cuts of meat puts significant physical strain on these tools.</p>",147
149,potato masher,"<p>Potato mashers are a simple cooking tool, but like any other basic kitchen item, a high-quality one will be much easier to use. Through extensive product research and analyzing user reviews, we chose the best potato mashers keeping a few criteria in mind.</p> <p>Most importantly, the potato masher should mash soft foods easily and effectively. We chose potato mashers with effective mashing heads and comfortable handles. We prioritized mashing heads that were appropriately spaced to create smooth potatoes without being so fine that they were difficult to clean. Ergonomic and nonslip handles were also two important features.</p> <p>Potato mashers are a kitchen necessity for many, so we also kept affordability in mind when choosing the top picks. To cater to a range of users, we chose both wire and perforated-style mashers. Our list of top picks includes a masher suitable for almost anyone, from those with weak hands to aspiring chefs to young kids.</p>",154
150,knives for cutting meat,"<p>We researched the most sought-after meat knives in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their materials, blade type, size and weight, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best knives for cutting meat, the most popular types among users were the plain-edge, Granton, and hollow-edge knife blades with stainless steel, high-carbon steel, and food-grade steel. Many of these knives also come with rubber or triple-tempered fiberglass nonslip handles, while others have wooden handles for a pleasing aesthetic.</p> <p>As for ease of use and maneuverability, we incorporated chef’s knives ranging in length from 8 to 14 inches and in weight from 1 ounce to 1.9 pounds for different cutting tasks. For added convenience, select knives on our list are made with hanging holes, are sharpened or made by hand, or have been heat treated or tempered for maximum durability and longevity. Moreover, select options require minimal sharpening and maintenance.</p>",159
151,saute pan,"<p>For avid cooks, a high-quality saute pan is a must-have kitchen essential. The best saute pans are ideal for browning, frying, and even baking. The ample capacity of 4-5 quarts means many of the featured picks also aid in cooking large cuts and group meals.</p> <p>The best saute pans are also compatible with multiple cooking surfaces, allow for the heat to be evenly distributed, provide nonstick cooking, and ensure clean-up is easy. The above selection is made from predominantly sturdy stainless steel and aluminum with many options including nonstick coatings.</p> <p>With these constructions, many of the above pans can be used in the oven or broiler and can go in the dishwasher. These picks also come with the advantage of stay-cool or riveted handles, tempered glass or shatter-resistant lids, side helper handles, and tapered edges for easy maneuvering during the cooking process.</p>",141
152,coffee percolators,"<p>We researched the best coffee percolators in a variety of categories from reputable brands with high customer satisfaction. The featured list takes into account the type of coffee maker, brew method, brew capacity, material, and special features included by top brands.</p> <p>In selecting the top coffee makers, we made sure to include both stovetop and electric options that produce coffee using either the gravity or pressure method. We chose coffee makers containing stainless steel or aluminum for durability and longevity. The top picks range from 8-cup to 12-cup models to accommodate different user needs. Additionally, we prioritized models with convenient features like easy-pour spouts and heat-resistant handles.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Coffee Percolator</h2> <p>There are numerous reasons to brew your java with a coffee percolator. These coffee makers have some shared benefits, and others depend on the type or brewing method:</p> <ul><li>Percolators let you enjoy coffee at a fraction of the cost compared to a coffee shop.</li><li>They produce a stronger, more full-bodied brew than a drip coffee maker.</li><li>Higher brewing temperature removes some of the impurities in ground coffee, enhancing the aroma.</li><li>They can easily be cleaned by rinsing with water or using the dishwasher.</li><li>Pressure percolators (Moka pots) allow you to brew espresso-style coffee without buying an expensive espresso machine.</li><li>Stovetop percolators can be used on a variety of heating elements, so they’re great for camping, hiking, and travel when there is no access to electricity.</li></ul>",235
153,carbon steel wok,"<p>Choosing the best carbon steel woks required examining a blend of features ranging from the materials and manufacturing to the accessories included with the wok. We looked at more than 50 woks from various manufacturers to find the best of the best.</p> <p>Manufacturing/construction: Traditional woks are hand-hammered, so we wanted to make sure to include models made in the traditional style for a truly authentic cooking experience. However, machine manufacturing doesn’t lag behind. We also looked for high-quality machine-made woks with precision in the design.</p> <p>Handle design: A wok’s handle plays a vital role in the cooking experience because of the tossing motion used in traditional Asian cooking. Long, heat-resistant handles that balance the wok made the list. We also looked for models with two handles to make it easier for cooks to move the wok.</p> <p>Accessories and extras: Nonstick coatings, spatulas, and lids can all broaden the wok’s uses and make cooking easier.</p>",154
154,french fry cutter,"<p>We researched the most sought-after french fry cutters in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their materials, the number of blades, cutting size, size and weight, ease of use, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best french fry cutters available, the most popular options among users were made with stainless steel blades, cast-iron stainless steel constructions, plastic, and BPA-free plastic with one to three blades included. These cutters can make 0.375-, 0.5-, 0.25-, 0.167-, and 0.125-inch cuts into potatoes to make french fries, while select picks can take on harder vegetables like sweet potatoes and beets.</p> <p>While these tools can be dangerous if used incorrectly, almost all of them are easy to use with a simple push or ratchet-style mechanism. For added convenience, most french fry cutters on our list come with nonskid bases, suction-cup feet, rustproof constructions, and are even dishwasher-safe. Plus, most of these french fry cutters are compact and lightweight enough to store in existing kitchen space.</p>",172
155,large air fryer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after large air fryers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their capacity, wattage, presets and cooking settings, temperature range, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The above picks were selected based on their ample capacities ranging from 0.6 to 20 quarts in capacity with 1,500 to 1,800-watts of power. With this in mind, each is capable of air frying effectively, while some models are also capable of rotisserie, baking, roasting, proofing, dehydrating, broiling, toasting, and more. To help perform all of your cooking tasks, many of these large air fryers come equipped with 5 to 13 easy-to-use presets.</p> <p>While not every product lists its temperature range, select options can be set between 104 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit for your preferred cooking temperature. In the interest of making sure this list contained the best large-capacity air fryers, our top picks also included models with additional accessories, patented cooking features, built-in timers, recipe books, adjustable racks, and auto-shutoff features.</p>",170
156,mini freezer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after mini freezers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by type, storage capacity, temperature range, adjustability, and other special features included by the top refrigerator brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best mini freezers on the market, the most popular type among users were the upright models for their ease of use and reversible freezer doors, which is why we included ample options in this category. While not as popular, the chest and portable models are also viable options for those that need ample storage space or a freezer that can fit in a vehicle or RV.</p> <p>To ensure that our picks had ample space, we included 1.1- to 3.5-cubic-foot models for your storage needs, each ranging between -11.2 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Many models also come with adjustable or removable shelves, in-door storage, and pull-out drawers. Some models also come with special features like LED displays, manual temperature controls, USB chargers, and adjustable legs.</p>",164
157,grill mats,"<p>The best grill mats should be able to withstand high temperatures, easy to clean, and reusable, all while still allowing the food cooked on them to acquire the classic grilled taste. Our top picks stood out in our research for their high level of durability, nonstick properties, and how easy they were to keep clean and reuse. Our list of recommendations feature a range of choices, all of which are able to withstand temperatures up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (in compliance with FDA regulations) and is more than enough to still get those trademark grill lines on your meats and veggies (without worrying about juices dripping into the grill and making a mess).</p> <p>We are aware that price is always a top consideration for shoppers, so we made sure to include budget-friendly options that typically come with multiple grill mats in a pack, as well as premium-priced options that tend to last a little longer per grill mat.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Grill Mats</h2> <p>Post-meal cleanup is one of the least enjoyable aspects of grilling, but a grill mat makes this task a lot easier. A grill mat sits on top of the grill grates, protecting them from the fat, oil, sauces, and other liquids that typically stick to the grates before falling into the grill and filling up the grease trap. The grill mat eliminates the need to clean the grates, the inside of the grill, the grease trap, or having to use a grill brush at all. Instead, you just have to hand wash a single flat mat.</p> <p>Grill mats are great for packing away with camping gear or taking to the park for a family barbecue. Because a grill mat covers grill grates, you can use public grills safely and feel confident that your cooking surface is sanitary.</p> <p>Having a grill mat is also beneficial in expanding your culinary repertoire. Many foods that chefs commonly cook on the stove or in the oven can be prepared on the grill. The foods’ flavor and consistency is very different on the grill—it’s like experiencing a whole new meal and not settling for the same old dish.</p> <ul><li>Cleaning up is much easier when oils, sauces, and other liquids are collected on a grill mat rather than splashed on grill grates.</li><li>Take a grill mat to the park or a campsite to ensure your cooking surface on public grills is sanitary.</li><li>With a grill mat, there are many foods that can be prepared on the grill that would otherwise fall through the grates, introducing a great new way to enjoy some old favorites.</li></ul>",432

Our list of recommendations offers a selection of products from the best brands on the market, which stand out for their quality, longevity and compatibility. We made sure that our top picks come with robust NSF testing and verification, and some of these filters boast several certifications and ratings to provide the highest water quality possible.</p> <p>In our research we noted that a vital consideration for shoppers is replacement frequency, so we made sure to include options for filters that last longer than the average 200 gallons—one of our picks can last for a whopping 500 gallons—to help reduce the number of times per year that the filter needs to be replaced.</p>",137
159,small cooler,"<p>When researching cooler brands on the market, we focused on a selection of the most reputable manufacturers known for high-quality, durable materials.

As such, we took care to include the best options for shoppers looking for a certain cooler size. Many of our picks are also available in multiple colors and patterns to suit individual styles.</p>",134
160,reusable k cup,"<p>We researched the most sought-after reusable K cups in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their quantity, capacity, materials, mesh size, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>To ensure our list included the best reusable coffee pods on the market, we included options that include 1 to 6 K cups per order to ensure your coffee maker is covered for years to come. Each of the options included in our list makes a standard cup of coffee with a 2 teaspoon capacity, while select options can make larger coffees with a 3- or 4-teaspoon volume.</p> <p>All of the above reusable K cup pods are made with BPA-free plastic and fine-mesh stainless steel for durability, safety, and proper filtration. Plus, each can be put in the dishwasher for easy clean-up. As for special features, select K cups included above are made with recessed bottoms, thumb-controlled lids, and compatibility with Keurig coffee makers as well as other brands.</p>",164
161,dishwasher rinse aid,"<p>We researched the most sought-after rinse aids in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their form, quantity, compatibility with dishware and water types, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best rinse aids available, the most popular type among users were the liquid options as they are easy to use and dissolve quickly. While not as popular, the powdered options are also viable options that not only clean the dishes but also the dishwasher itself. Each of the rinse aids included in our list last through many washes with their 8- to 23-ounce quantities per bottle for cloud- and streak-free results on glassware, plates, cutlery, and even plastics.</p> <p>For added convenience, select options are capable of cleaning dishes while using hard water while being completely septic- and greywater-safe. While some of these rinse aids are chemical-based, select options are made with all-natural ingredients or are 100 percent biodegradable.</p>",159
162,small air fryer,"<p>The best small air fryers make it a pleasant task to reheat leftovers, cook crispy frozen fries, or fry up chicken wings for game day. With their recent boom in popularity, it can be overwhelming to shop for an air fryer that lives up to its culinary promises. We conducted thorough product research to find our top picks, choosing them based on performance, functionality, and ease of use.</p> <p>When narrowing down our top choices, we looked for highly rated fryers from top brands. The air fryers on our list boast user-friendly designs (with effective crisper baskets and adjustable temperature settings) to get foods hot and crisp.</p> <p>In terms of functionality, we looked for fryers with adjustable temperature, timers, and safety features like overheat protection, auto shutoff, and cool-touch exteriors. Extra functions or presets were also features we prioritized, as air fryers should work as a versatile countertop appliance. Last, we checked that the air fryers were easy to clean (and choose many with dishwasher-safe parts) to make cleanup as easy as the cooking process.</p>",174
163,epoxy for countertops,"<p>When gathering our list of recommendations, we made sure to look at odor and VOC content to avoid highly toxic brands that leave behind odors for long periods of time. Our top picks are made without any VOCs and can be used safely around the home. We made sure to also include several options that are completely food safe for added peace of mind.</p> <p>Since curing time is a major factor for shoppers to consider depending on the needs of their specific project, we have included products whose curing times vary from just 3 days up to a full 30 days to become fully heat resistant. In addition, our recommended brands are all easy to use, most with a simple 1:1 ratio and with self-leveling mixtures that are suitable for both DIY beginners and professionals.</p>",135
164,smokeless indoor grills,"<p>We tested each grill with a variety of protein, vegetable, and other typical barbecue products, examining each feature. We gave these elements scores ranging from one to four, with four being the highest. Factors included temperature, amount of cooking surface, ease of setup and cleanup, durability, portability, storability, cord length, and price. We also reviewed customer satisfaction with both product and service and considered the learning curve for each appliance.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Smokeless Indoor Grill</h2> <p>Those living in an apartment with no means of grilling outdoors or looking for a way to continue grilling when the weather outside is frightful will find plenty of reasons to own a smokeless indoor grill. First and foremost, it allows a cook to grill inside while still taking advantage of all that a full kitchen has to offer. Electric smokeless grills might not have the max temperatures offered by charcoal and gas models, but they allow for more precise temperature control and cooking food to temperature easier. Smokeless indoor grills, with their grease-management systems, ability to break down into separate parts, and significantly smaller size, are easier to clean and maintain.</p> <ul><li>Precise temperature controls</li><li>Easy to clean and maintain</li><li>Grill in the comfort of a full indoor kitchen</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using the Best Smokeless Indoor Grills</h2> <p>There are a few tips to keep in mind when using a smokeless indoor grill. As with outdoor grills, give the grill some time to preheat. Most electric smokeless grills take about 10 minutes to reach their full temperature. This is especially important for searing burgers or steaks. Help reduce smoke by properly preparing your meat, fish, or vegetables. If the item is marinated, remove excess marinade and small particles of herbs or garlic, all of which will burn at lower temperatures, creating smoke.</p> <p>Ventilate the kitchen and turn on your range’s fan to circulate air. When grilling, resist the urge to fiddle with the items. Leave steaks, chops, burgers, fish, and plant-based proteins alone for the recommended time on each side to ensure you get those perfect grill marks. It’s much easier to remove charred food when the grill is hot versus when it’s cold. Make cleanup easier by scraping the grill grates with a brush while the grill is still hot.</p> <p>Finally, don’t forget to read the directions and follow them to ensure you’re using your electric smokeless grill properly. Many of them require you to fill a well with water that traps the smoke before you begin.</p> <ul><li>Preheat the grill before cooking</li><li>Remove sugary marinades that can burn at low temperatures</li><li>Ventilate kitchen</li><li>Give food time to cook before turning</li></ul>",434
165,freezer containers,"<p>All the criteria discussed in detail above went into the selection of the freezer containers described in this guide. Safety, versatility, and convenience are all key considerations when it comes to freezer containers. We ensured that our recommendations had airtight lids to deter freezer burn and keep food fresh. We looked for products that are easy to use, clean, and store.</p> <p>Brand recognition was also a factor, so offerings from reliable manufacturers like Snapware, Rubbermaid, and Ziploc were valued. Customer reviews, both the number of reviews as well as high ratings, held significant weight as well.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Freezer Containers</h2> <p>Freezer containers help avoid food waste, saving consumers money. They allow you to safely freeze both leftovers and full meals prepared in advance. Some are lightweight and portable, ideal for taking lunch to work, while others are large enough to hold dinner for the family—which can be a real blessing during busy times when cooking isn’t an option. Freezer storage containers allow a convenient way to have fresh-tasting food on hand, and they come in such a wide variety of sizes, shapes, and materials that there should be ample options for any household.</p> <ul><li>Reduce food waste</li><li>Save money</li><li>Save time</li></ul>",202
166,bar sink faucets,"<p>We used a variety of criteria while reviewing dozens of bar faucets for our list. Size is crucial when it comes to finding the right bar faucet, so we chose models that provide ample clearance under the spout for cleaning various-size barware while maintaining a short enough reach to suit smaller sink sizes. Keeping functionality in mind, we made sure to include models with detachable sprayers that make it easier to rinse and fill glassware.</p> <p>Design is also important, so we selected a variety of different styles to suit different bar looks, favoring models with multiple finish options. In an effort to meet the needs of various budgets, we included high-end models from some of the most well-known faucet manufacturers as well as budget options from boutique-sized companies.</p>",128
167,dual fuel ranges,"<p>Given the many different configurations possible with dual fuel ranges, we set out to offer the widest possible choice. We applied the following criteria:</p> <ul><li>Burners and BTUs: We not only looked at the number of burners or the stove’s maximum power output but also the versatility that the range offers.</li><li>Ovens: Capacity is always important, but a 48-inch dual fuel range doesn’t always have much more interior space than a 30-inch model. We looked at functionality and cleaning as well as at overall capacity.</li><li>Features: Anything that makes the cook’s life easier is a valuable bonus, so we looked for user-friendly feature sets.</li><li>Brand and value: Some brands are known for their value-for-money, and cost is always an important factor. However, we also included premium brands that focus first on performance.</li></ul>",128
168,whirlpool refrigerators,"<p>With so many brands and models to choose from, buying a new refrigerator can be overwhelming. Even after you’ve decided to purchase one from the reliable Whirlpool brand, the variety of models can make your head spin. We considered more than 20 refrigerators to find our top picks, choosing among popular types to narrow down the best Whirlpool refrigerators.</p> <p>Performance was the most important metric when choosing our top picks. Through researching the available products and considering consumer reviews, we selected refrigerators that are highly rated for maintaining a consistent temperature to keep food safe and fresh. Each fridge in the lineup also has humidity control features or filter options that help slow spoilage.</p> <p>Aside from great performance, a good refrigerator should also be pleasant to use. We looked for user-friendly design features, including smart shelving configurations (adjustable shelves or bins earned extra points), comfortable lighting, easy-to-see contents, and glass wall-to-wall shelving to maximize capacity.</p>",155
169,whirlpool dishwashers,"<p>Compared to some other household appliances, choosing a dishwasher is rather straightforward. Dishwashers tend to have fewer fancy features than refrigerators or washing machines, but their relative simplicity makes performance all the more important—the best dishwashers get dishes sparkling clean with little effort on your part.</p> <p>We considered 15 Whirlpool dishwashers, judging each model based on performance. Through researching product specifications and reading reviews from trusted sources and consumers, we evaluated dishwashers based on ease of use, design, and cleaning performance. When it came to ease of use, we took ease of loading, capacity, and noise level into consideration. Design encompassed aesthetics, performance, and durability. Lastly, the dishwashers on our list have a good track record of cleaning and drying dishes; no prewashing or additional cycles needed.</p>",127
170,ductless range hoods,"<p>Ductless range hoods serve a niche sector in kitchen appliances. They’re a good choice for small homes, apartments, and kitchens without an existing duct system. When compiling this list, we considered the CFM, the installation type, finishes, filters, and extra features.</p> <p>We looked for models with a CFM between 200 to 600. Fans within that range can move a good deal of air to remove smoke and grease. We looked for easy installation but also how well the installation type fits with the hood’s overall effectiveness and design.</p> <p>Models that came with extra finishes got bonus points because they add versatility. Washable, reusable filters reduce the overall cost of the hood, but we also considered how well the filters work with the overall hood design. Finally, the extra features, such as heat sensors, touch screens, and lighting, played into our final choices.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Ductless Range Hood</h2> <p>Ductless range hoods have some distinct advantages. They’re versatile because they can be installed in a number of places. They can fit under cabinets, on a wall, or above an island. These ductless models clean and recirculate the air, putting clean air back into the kitchen. This process removes harmful particulates from the breathable air. A ductless design also provides versatility. Should you decide to remodel, the ductless range hood can move to a different location; whereas, a ducted model must stay with the duct system.</p> <h2>Tips for Maintaining and Cleaning a Ductless Range Hood</h2> <p>Read through the owner’s manual as soon as the hood is installed to learn the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions and tips. Maintaining the filters and filtration system regularly helps keep the hood in good working order, including cleaning the hood’s exterior and checking the filters. Filters need replacement or cleaning at least every 6 months and more often for frequent cooking.</p> <ul><li>Clean the filters at least every 6 months.</li><li>Keep extra bulbs on hand for models with built-in lighting.</li><li>Clean the exterior of the hood with an appropriate cleaner.</li></ul>",331
171,undercounter ice makers,"<p>Since undercounter ice makers are built into your cabinets, put as much thought into choosing one as any other major appliance. When choosing the best undercounter ice makers, we researched products based on a few important criteria. We considered more than 25 built-in ice makers and narrowed down the top picks according to their performance, durability, ease of use, and price.</p> <p>We looked at production rates, storage capacities, and factors that contribute to ice quality, such as filters or proprietary technology. We prioritized ice makers constructed with durable materials, favoring stainless steel over plastic. Ice makers with additional ease-of-use features (self-cleaning settings, timers, and LCD controls) earned extra points.</p> <p>To accommodate the needs of a wide range of shoppers, we also chose several budget-friendly units. Lastly, since reputable kitchen appliance brands usually manufacture more reliable products, we stuck to recognizable brands.</p>",141
172,dual zone wine fridges,"<p>We considered more than 25 dual zone wine fridges to narrow down the best options for most homes. Personal wine collections vary almost as much as types of wine, so we chose a mix of freestanding and built-in fridges with a range of capacities and sizes to suit different needs.</p> <p>However, just cooling the wine isn’t enough, so we chose fridges with a range of protective features to maintain wine in optimal storage conditions. We chose wine fridges from reputable brands to ensure the fridge can reliably maintain a stable temperature and environment. Other features we looked for included a useful temperature range, double- or triple-layered UV-protective doors, adjustable shelving, and a sleek design to store wine in a unit that’s as fashionable as it is functional.</p>",127
173,dinnerware set,"<p>Selecting the best dinnerware sets available depended upon the variety of dishes offered in each set, the materials used, the colorways offered, and the versatility of the designs. Most dinnerware sets listed above come with dinner plates, salad plates, bowls, and mugs to provide 4-6 plate settings. Select sets also come with utensils for added convenience.</p> <p>Many dinnerware sets offered are made with stoneware, melamine, glass, bone china, and plastic, all of which offer durability and stain-resistance for long lifespans. To match your current fixtures and cookware, many of these picks are offered in multiple colorways from neutral tones to colorful patterns.</p> <p>Though the melamine picks are not dishwasher or microwave-safe, almost all of the dinnerware sets above can be used in the oven, freezer, microwave, and dishwasher. Plus, some picks are made without the use of chemicals, BPAs, and lead for added peace of mind.</p>",146
174,water cooler,"<p>Whether at home or at the office, a water cooler will likely attract a lot of use, so you’ll want to choose the best one for your needs and budget. We researched product specifications and considered consumer reviews to narrow down our top picks, selecting water coolers with good specifications and great real-world performance.</p> <p>The best water coolers are pleasant to use and easy to maintain. We chose water coolers with user-friendly buttons or spigots, multiple temperature modes, and hot water safety lock features to ensure both convenience and safety. Extra features like night lights, adjustable temperatures, and an attractive design earned coolers extra points.</p> <p>A good water cooler should also be easy to maintain, so we searched for features like removable and dishwasher-safe drip trays, or even entire self-cleaning systems. Lastly, to cover most shoppers, we included water coolers at a range of price points, so you can stay hydrated within your budget.</p>",154
175,steak knives,"<p>Similar to a good kitchen knife, top-rated steak knives are sturdy, sharp, and comfortable to hold. We conducted thorough product research and considered shopper reviews to find the best steak knife sets for most homes. When evaluating steak knives, we considered performance first, looking for knives with a sharp blade, well-balanced design, and comfortable-to-hold handle. With a few exceptions, we prioritized knives with a straight-edge upswept blade, which glides through meat easily for nice, clean cuts.</p> <p>Since many steak knives are meant to look impressive, we also sought sturdy and handsome handle materials (choosing a range to suit different tastes) and an attractive design overall. To ensure quality, we chose knives from top brands, including those with a long legacy and good reputation, like Wüsthof, Victorinox, and Zwilling.</p>",128
176,pole saw,"<p>We used the pole saws in this guide to trim up encroaching branches from a backyard’s natural area. The area included a mix of green hardwoods and evergreens, as well as hardened dead branches. We did our best to push each tool to its operable limits in terms of working height, difficulty of reach or angle, and branch diameter.</p> <p>We based our considerations and comments on the tools’ physical measurements, as well as the ways they performed and felt. We assumed that most readers would not require an expensive pro-quality tool for daily use but would still be interested in high-quality equipment capable of occasional long work days. Therefore, we based our top picks on a combination of functionality, durability, and price point.</p>",123
177,stump grinders,"<p>In reviewing more than a dozen stump grinders, we used a variety of criteria to narrow the field to produce our list of the top options. Grinding stumps requires a significant amount of torque, so we limited our search to those grinders with powerful engines of at least 14 horsepower. This engine size allows grinders to reach depths of at least 8 inches and as much as 16 inches, which is enough to handle small- to medium-size tree stumps. Stump grinders are heavy by nature, but they shouldn’t be so heavy that a single person can’t safely operate the machine. With that in mind, we stuck with stump grinders with manageable weights as well as models that feature hitch options that allow them to be towed to and from the job site. Finally, durability was a key factor in our selection process. Grinding out stumps puts tremendous strain on machinery, so we stuck with models made from heavy-gauge steel that can endure repeated use without falling apart.</p> <h2>Tips for Using the Best Stump Grinder</h2> <p>A stump grinder can make quick work of that ugly stump in the middle of the yard, but only if it’s operated correctly. Stump grinders are dangerous machines. First and foremost, take the necessary safety precautions by wearing safety goggles, ear protection, and clothing that covers exposed skin. While the machine has safeguards to protect the operator, such as guards that block debris and auto-shutoff bars, they won’t prevent harm to bystanders. Cordon off the area around the stump removal area to prevent people or pets from getting too close. Stump grinders are made to grind stumps, not rocks. Remove any stones, rocks, or debris from around the stump that may damage the grinder’s blades. A stump grinder may do the job of grinding up the stump, but you’ll need other tools to assist, including a rake, shovel, and chainsaw.</p> <ul><li>Wear the appropriate safety gear</li><li>Put boundaries around the area to keep people and pets at a safe distance</li><li>Remove rocks and debris from around the stump</li><li>Have a rake, shove, and chainsaw handy</li></ul>",345
178,weed eater string,"<p>We researched the best trimmer lines in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their materials, shape, thickness, the quantity provided, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best string trimmer lines on the market, the most popular types among users were made with gatorline, nylon, polymer, and colymer and had round, square, twisted, and multi-sided designs, each with their unique durability, cutting power, and noise- and vibration-reduction. We also included weed wacker strings of varying sizes for light- to heavy-duty yard work, ranging from .080 to .155 inches, making them compatible with a range of residential and commercial weed wacker heads.</p> <p>For added convenience, these top picks range from 140 to 1,447 feet long for effective cutting, all season long. Plus, some of these weed wacker strings were made with durable inner cores, protective outer layers, and even storage cases for ease of use.</p>",155
179,mole repellent,"<p><span>For the purpose of selecting a list of the </span><span>best mole repellent</span><span> products, it was necessary to have a firm understanding of the various methods for treating mole infestations, like </span><span>ultrasonic repellents</span><span>, </span><span>natural repellents</span><span>, or chemical repellents. It was also important to know how to apply each treatment to the </span><span>mole tunnels</span><span> and the surrounding area, as well as how the </span><span>repellents work</span><span> to end </span><span>mole activity</span><span> in your yard before the </span><span>mole tunnels</span><span> can extend into the garden.</span></p> <p><span>Extensive research into over 25 different mole repellents helped to form the basis for this selection. Products were chosen based on the type of repellent, coverage area, ease of use, and compatible pests. Also, any additional features that helped a product stand out from competitors were taken into consideration, like a dustless formula, ready-to-use container, or a resistance to rain.</span></p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Mole Repellent</h2> <p>Taking care of a pest problem in your yard may mean turning to traps or poisons, but a repellent is a much less hands-on solution. Repellents encourage moles to move along to a different location on their own, instead of a poison that can leave bodies to clean up or traps that must be checked and emptied frequently. If you prefer humane traps, then you will also have to properly relocate the moles whenever they are caught.</p> <p><span>If that sounds tiring, it is. </span><span>Getting rid of moles</span><span> is harder once they have moved in and begun building their subterranean labyrinth. So, if you know that your area is prone to mole problems, then invest in an ongoing mole repellent, like ultrasonic stakes, so that you never have to deal with a full infestation in your yard.</span></p> <p>Mole repellent products come in a wide assortment of options that are safe for you, your kids, your pets, and the environment, so that you don’t have to feel guilty about getting rid of a pest that is damaging your yard.</p> <ul><li>No dead or trapped moles means that you won’t have to worry about clean up or relocation.</li><li>Moles are much harder to get rid of than to prevent, so having an active mole repellent is the best way to keep your yard mole-free.</li><li>Most mole repellents are either all natural or ultrasonic, meaning that you won’t have to worry about harming the environment while treating your pest problem.</li></ul>",388
180,sleeping bag,"<p>Though there are many sleeping bags on the market, selecting ones that are exemplary and made for your camping adventures can be difficult. Selections for the best sleeping bags depended upon their type, design, materials and warmth provided, and special features included.</p> <p>With rectangular and mummy-styled designs, the above list contains picks that are suitable for winter, three-season, and summer use. The mummy design of many of these picks offers concentrated heat in cool temperatures plus hoods and footboxes, while the rectangular designs offer roomy interiors for restless sleepers.

Including interior pockets, multiple colorways and sizes offered, connectors for sleeping pads and air mattresses, and double-filled designs for added coziness.</p>",171
181,grass seed,"<p>We researched the most sought-after grass seed in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, suitable season(s), intended use, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The most popular types of grass seed among users is Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, and fescue for their suitability in multiple climates and their ability to grow thick, durable grass. While not as popular, Bermuda and zoysia grass types are also viable options for those who live in southern areas with a lot of sun. What’s more, these mixes can cover small or large yards depending on your needs.</p> <p>Many of the grass seeds are also capable of fixing patchy areas on existing grass or growing new plantings for your whole lawn. Plus, many of these options are mixes, which makes them easy to maintain without intense labor. For added convenience, select grass seeds included in our list come with protective coatings to protect them from disease and to aid in water retention or have fertilizer built in.</p>",171
182,cornhole board,"<p>Cornhole sets and bags are an easy to use, fun, and budget-friendly way to have tons of fun with your family and friends, year after year. Selections for the best cornhole boards depended upon size, portability, materials, and accessories.</p> <p>With small and large options represented, the above list is curated for every preference or space limit. Each set of boards is also made to be light enough to carry and many come with handles or carrying bags for easy portability. These boards are also multifunctional as some can double as tables, a ladder toss set, and other lawn games.</p> <p>The sturdy wood, aluminum, polyethylene, and melamine constructions also ensure that each of these sets has a long-lasting lifespan. Many are also made to be weather and scratch-resistant so you can play rain or shine without needing an umbrella. Finally, each of these boards comes with pre-filled bags and select options also have plastic rings or bolas for ladder and ring toss.</p>",161
183,artificial grass,"<p>Extensive research into each product, including a thorough examination of the durability, style, color, texture, backing, and overall construction, was necessary to select the top artificial grass products. Durability was one of the most important factors because artificial turf is regularly subjected to human and animal foot traffic, which can quickly destroy substandard artificial grass.</p> <p>Additionally, the appearance and texture of the artificial grass were key components in the selection process because most users are looking for an artificial product that closely mimics natural grass. The material and style of the artificial grass were considered for both the appearance and durability of the product, while the pile height and product material also were necessary for determining foot traffic suitability. Artificial grass products that had built-in drainage holes or a multilayered backing to improve durability were typically considered superior to similar products that lacked these features.</p>",145
184,flea spray,"<p>We researched the most sought-after flea sprays in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, compatible insect types, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and working time.</p> <p>When searching for the best flea and tick home sprays on the market, the chemical sprays appeared to be the most popular for their immediate or quick effectiveness, their ability to kill ample types of insects, and, in some cases, an integrated insect growth regulator.</p> <p>Though less popular, the natural remedies are ideal for the eco-conscious consumer and are safer for use directly on pets. No matter the type, the above picks focus on many insect types including Fleas, ticks, bed bugs, cockroaches, ants, flies, spiders, mosquitoes, earwigs, and silverfish.</p> <p>While select options are meant for spraying on pets directly, many are made for use on furniture, carpeting, pet tools, plants and lawns, and even in the garage. While some may take a few minutes to kick in, most of these flea sprayers kill on contact and keep pests away for weeks or months per application.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Flea Spray</h2> <p>There are many factors to consider when choosing the best flea spray, depending on your needs and those of your household members, including pets. Pay attention to the listed ingredients, the pest(s) you’re trying to eliminate or prevent, and the types of applications on the market, how long they take to kick in, and how often you need to use them.</p> <ul><li>To eliminate fleas and other pests together, look for an all-in-one option.</li><li>If you have pets, get a treatment that can be used directly on your pet as well as on surfaces inside and outside your home.</li><li>Watch for chemical sensitivities—natural products are always an option.</li><li>Though buying in bulk gives you the best value, don’t invest in a large quantity of a new product until you know it will work—start with the smallest size to ensure you like the formula before buying more.</li></ul>",325
185,picnic baskets,"<p>We researched the most sought-after picnic baskets in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their size, materials, capacity, and other special features.</p> <p>The insulated models were the most popular type among users because of their temperature-regulating designs and ease of use. Alternatively, the traditional wicker picnic baskets provide ample capacity, lightweight constructions, and a classic look. Many of these baskets are made with durable wicker, fabric, stainless steel, and aluminum for longevity and portability.</p> <p>Some of these picks are suitable for small amounts of food and drink, while select picks can hold over 65 pounds of food, wine, beer, and dishware. Plus, some of these picks come with utensils, plates, wine glasses, cutting boards, wine openers, and cheese knives.</p>",125
186,cordless blower,"<p>Choosing this top selection of the best cordless blowers was possible after researching all the key considerations users may have when selecting a leaf blower. Many of the above picks are made with different specifications like powerful batteries and airflow, thoughtful features, and lightweight designs.</p> <p>Some of the key unique features that are included in these products are the trigger-locking features, comfort-grip handles, and airflow attachments that can assist in the types of jobs you have in your yard.</p> <p>One of the other versatile features that some of the options above have is two-in-one functionality as both a blower and vacuum. However, some of the options above come without their respective chargers or batteries, and this should be taken into consideration before purchase.</p>",123
187,tick sprays for yard,"<p>We researched the most sought-after sprays for repelling ticks in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, application method, coverage area, compatible insect types, ingredients, and other special features included by the top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best pest solutions on the market, the most popular type among users were the concentrates with their easy application and wide area coverages of 5,000 to 5,334 square feet. All of the tick sprays included in this list can be attached to garden hoses for easy application with most options including a built-in garden hose attachment for killing ticks.</p> <p>For added convenience, each of these tick sprays repels and kills ticks and other pests, some reaching hundreds of other pest varieties. Finally, the list includes both pesticides and natural plant-based formulas for homes with kids and pets.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Tick Spray in Your Yard</h2> <p>Before spraying the yard, always check the manufacturer’s directions to make sure that you know how to use the product properly. For best results, users should avoid spraying the yard during or shortly after rainfall because water can dilute the poison and reduce its efficacy. Begin treating your yard in the spring after any snow has melted, and continue treating it regularly throughout the summer months. Make sure to use proper personal protective equipment (PPE), like gloves, a mask, and long pants and long sleeves, when using pesticides.</p> <p>Ticks are found primarily in wooded areas, deep foliage, gardens, tall grass, and under piles of mulch. For this reason it’s important to keep the yard well maintained, and rake up grass mulch after mowing. Take away their favorite spots, and you’ll have fewer ticks to deal with. These pests also like piles of brush and wood because they prey on mice and other rodents that live in these cool locations.</p> <p>It’s important to remember that some tick sprays contain dangerous active ingredients that are strictly regulated by local and state laws. Before choosing the best tick spray for yard infestations, always check local and state laws in your region to make sure that the product is approved for use.</p> <ul><li>For best results, begin spraying the yard after any snow has melted and the ground has dried out.</li><li>Use tick spray in wooded areas, gardens, dense foliage, tall grass, and other areas where ticks are likely to live and feed.</li><li>Local and state regulations for tick spray products vary. Always check regulations in your area before choosing a tick spray.</li></ul>",416
188,grass seed for overseeding,"<p>Extensive product research went into selecting this roundup of the best grass seeds for overseeding. While grass seeds are limited to just a few well-known producers, today’s hybridized seeds and revolutionary seed coatings are capable of producing lush, resilient lawns.</p> <p>We selected the above products based on brand reputation, the quality of the seeds—including the percentage of weed seeds in the mix—and how well each performed in its stated category or region. We opted for seeds that will strengthen and enhance existing lawns without the need for frequent watering. Being drought and disease resistant topped our list of requirements.</p> <h2>Tips on How to Overseed a Lawn</h2> <p>Overseeding an existing lawn is much simpler than putting in a new lawn from scratch because the grass is already established, and there’s no need to till or rake the soil. For the best germination results, consider the following tips.</p> <ul><li>Mow the lawn first and bag the clippings. Shorter grass will allow the new seedlings to receive more sunlight.</li><li>Rake the yard to remove leaves or dethatch if a heavy layer of thatch (organic matter that forms a mat) is present at ground level.</li><li>Add soil amendments before overseeding if necessary. The best way to do this is to have the soil tested by a local extension agency to determine if it lacks certain nutrients and then apply them before overseeding.</li><li>Add seeds to a drop spreader or a broadcast spreader and set the distribution rate to match the package’s recommended spread rate.</li><li>Water daily to keep the seeds moist—but not so much that the ground is soggy or water is pooling.</li></ul> <h2>Benefits of Overseeding</h2> <p>The most significant result of overseeding is the ability to grow a lush, dense lawn, but there are some other benefits as well.</p> <ul><li>Dense grass is less susceptible to soil erosion because the additional grass roots hold the soil in place.</li><li>Overseeding with today’s improved seed varieties will boost lawn health and make the grass more resistant to disease and insects.</li><li>A healthy lawn boosts curb appeal and is a strong selling point if a house is on the market.</li><li>The healthier the lawn, the less likely weeds are to get a foothold. This reduces the need for frequent applications of chemical herbicides, which is more beneficial for the environment.</li></ul>",374
189,rope for tree swings,"<p>We used several criteria when making selections for the best rope for swings. Safety is the most important factor to consider when selecting a rope, so strength was our number one priority: We only chose rope with a high enough tensile strength to support the weight of the rider, keeping in mind that a rope’s tensile strength declines as it ages and wears.</p> <p>Hanging a tree swing typically requires the user to tie the rope in knots, so the best rope for a swing is flexible enough and narrow enough in diameter to hold a strong knot. Since tree swing rope will spend its life outdoors, it must be able to endure harsh weather conditions, so we chose mainly weather-resistant synthetic materials.</p> <h2>Tips for Tree Swing Safety</h2> <p>Tree swings are capable of carrying the rider well up into the air, especially if hung from a high branch, so it’s crucial to take precautions to ensure safe operation. It matters little how strong the rope is if it’s tied to a weak branch. Choose a suitable branch from a healthy, mature hardwood tree. Avoid evergreens and fruit trees, which are weaker and prone to breaking. Hang the swing so that the seat is about 24 inches off the ground to ensure adequate clearance for the rider’s legs.</p> <p>The best rope for a rope swing is synthetic, so choose polypropylene when possible. It’s stronger than natural rope and better resistant to the weather. If opting for a natural rope, plan on replacing it every 2 years as it will absorb water and rot. Regularly inspect the swing seat and rope for wear and rot.</p> <ul><li aria-level=""1"">Attach the swing to a hardwood tree branch</li><li aria-level=""1"">Use synthetic rope or replace natural rope every 2 years</li><li aria-level=""1"">Inspect the rope and branch periodically for damage or rot</li></ul>",301
190,grass seed for northeast,"<p>Planting the right grass seed matters, especially in the Northeastern United States, where seasonal weather extremes and drought a part of daily life. Choosing the right grass variety can mean the difference between a lush, green lawn and a brown, patchy yard. When selecting our top picks for the best grass seed for the Northeast, we took grass variety into account, choosing grass varieties and grass seed mixes that grow fast and stand up well to the Northeastern climate.</p> <p>Several popular grass types are suitable in the Northeast region, so we researched product specifications and consumer reviews to narrow down our top picks. We chose grass seeds from reputable companies who built a brand off of creating reliable grass and garden products, so you know your lawn will be off to a healthy start.</p>",134
191,bermuda grass seed,"<p>Growing Bermuda grass from seed is relatively simple and will result in a lush and affordable lawn in the right conditions. A good lawn always starts with high-quality seeds. Through product research and consulting consumer reviews, we chose Bermuda grass seed products that are reliable and easy to grow.</p> <p>We noted coverage area, germination time, and maintenance expectations. Most homeowners want a beautiful lawn relatively quickly, so we chose hulled seeds. Many of the products we chose have beneficial coatings, which give gardeners the satisfaction of fast germination plus the benefits of the added coating, such as better water retention, disease control, and added nutrients for growth. To ensure good coverage and satisfaction year-round, we included a few different grass types and blends, which gives more flexibility in color, texture, and growing time.</p>",133
192,squirrel trap,"<p>We applied a variety of criteria when selecting the best squirrel traps for our list. A squirrel trap must be effective, so we chose models with proven designs that yield results, as well as those with mechanisms that work reliably. We also included a range of different types of traps to serve different purposes, including humane box traps along with lethal snap and tube traps.</p> <p>All the humane traps we selected have sturdy handles for safe-and-easy transportation of the animals once caught. Since squirrel traps are usually used outdoors, we chose traps made of durable galvanized steel that won’t rust or corrode when exposed to the elements. In addition, single-squirrel traps aren’t enough to deal with a bigger squirrel problem, so we included a model capable of catching multiple squirrels at once.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Squirrel Trap</h2> <p>After purchasing a trap, there are several ways to maximize the chances that the trap will successfully capture a squirrel. First, consider trap placement. Position the trap in a place along a squirrel’s usual travel path. The path typically is at the base of a tree, along a fence near a bird feeder, or along a wall near a part of the house that the squirrel is damaging.</p> <p>The best bait to catch squirrels is one they can’t easily steal, such as peanut butter. If it’s a solid bait, make sure it’s larger than the cage’s mesh. Position the bait so the squirrel must step on the pressure plate to get to it. When using a humane cage, check the trap frequently, since a squirrel will quickly become anxious and dehydrated once trapped.</p> <ul><li>Place the trap in an area that squirrels frequent</li><li>Use bait that squirrels can’t easily steal</li><li>Check the trap often</li></ul>",289
193,above ground pool steps,"<p>We reviewed 24 sets of pool steps to narrow the field to the top models on the market. To do so, we used a variety of criteria. Safety is the most important factor, so we only chose stairs with ample handrails, anti-slip treads, and barriers that prevent anyone from swimming behind them. When possible, we favored models with lockable gates that block access to the ladder when the pool is not in use.</p> <p>Durability and stability are also crucial shopping criteria, so we chose steps made from durable plastic resin that can withstand pool chemicals while maintaining a high weight capacity of around 300 pounds. A ladder should not move when someone is using it, so we chose models that would remain stable while in use, leaning toward those with brackets or flanges that allow them to be mounted to a deck.</p>",142
194,artificial grass for dogs,"<p>We used several criteria to evaluate the 25 different artificial grass products for pets. Artificial grass needs to look as close to the real thing as possible, so we chose grasses that used multiple colors and other features such as imitation thatch to add realism.</p> <p>Since artificial grass for pets is designed to handle pet waste, we only chose models with plenty of holes for quick drainage to prevent dog urine from pooling on top of the grass and causing unpleasant odors. Artificial grass also needs to be comfortable and durable, so most of our selections feature blade heights of around 1.5 inches and densities of 60 ounces or more.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Artificial Grass for Dogs</h2> <p>There are a number of benefits to installing artificial grass for dogs. Not only is artificial grass easy to maintain and clean, but it also helps keep your home clean as it produces no mud or grass clippings for Fido to track into the home. Simply hose down the turf to remove urine and remnants of solid waste.</p> <p>Artificial grass also helps reduce the pest population on a property. Unlike real grass, it does not allow bugs such as fleas, ticks, and ants to nest and multiply. Plus, unlike natural grass, your dog won’t be able to harm artificial grass by digging in it or killing the grass with its urine.</p> <ul><li>Artificial grass is easy to clean.</li><li>It doesn’t produce mud and clippings that a dog can track into a home.</li><li>Insects won’t breed in it.</li><li>It isn’t susceptible to damage from digging or pet urine.</li></ul>",261
195,inflatable water slides,"<p>We reviewed more than two dozen options, and a variety of criteria figured into our choices for the best inflatable water slides. Since a blow-up pool with a slide should support multiple children at once, we chose models that could occupy four to five kids with multiple play stations. Safety was also key, so we only considered models with safeguards to prevent falls and injury. Although the water slide is the main attraction, we favored those that offered a variety of attractions, including climbing walls, soaking pools, water cannons, basketball hoops, and bounce houses.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning an Inflatable Water Slide</h2> <p>Although inflatable water slides are somewhat of an investment, many advantages make them worth their sometimes steep price tags. First and foremost, a backyard water slide helps get kids outside in the heat of the summer. It eliminates the need for trips to crowded neighborhood pools and trumps backyard kiddie pools or vinyl slip-and-slides by a long shot. Larger inflatable water slides make a great activity for a backyard kids party. For this use, they practically pay for themselves by eliminating the need to reserve space at a local bouncy gym or water park.</p> <p>To recap, backyard inflatable water parks are:</p> <ul><li>A fun and engaging way to beat the summer heat</li><li>An excellent attraction for birthday parties</li><li>A great way to avoid crowds at the local pool</li></ul> <h2>Safety and Maintenance Tips for an Inflatable Water Slide</h2> <p>Inflatable slides provide hours of backyard entertainment. To get the most out of yours, make sure you adhere to the following guidelines to prevent damage to your slide and injury to its users.</p> <ul><li>Keep sharp objects away from the slide to prevent tears and other damage.</li><li>Stick strictly to the slide’s weight and occupancy limits to avoid damage and injury.</li><li>Never leave children unattended on the slide. Kids can drown in less than 2 inches of water.</li><li>Don’t allow roughhousing on the slide, which can lead to accident, injury, and damage.</li></ul>",324
196,inground pool slides,"<p>We used several criteria while reviewing more than 25 slides to narrow the field to the best pool slides. Slide construction ranked high since it’s critical to the durability and safety of the slide. With that in mind, we only chose rigid slides with rotomolded plastic, which is strong enough to support high weight capacities, those that can endure the elements and those that are smooth enough to promote sliding. For the best inflatable pool slides, we stuck with those made from thick vinyl that won’t easily puncture. We also stuck with models with ample handrails and nonslip treads to prevent falls. Of course, slides are also supposed to be fun, so we went with models steep enough to ensure a zippy ride while still being safe.</p>",127
197,skunk repellents,"<p>To make our selection of the top skunk repellents, we used several criteria. First and foremost, a skunk repellent needs to not harm animals or the environment in order to make our list of top picks, so we considered sprays and granules that are nontoxic and biodegradable as well as electronic repellents.</p> <p>A top-pick skunk repellent also doesn’t repel the home’s occupants, so we chose those that use either pleasant-smelling active ingredients, are placed away from areas used by people and pets, or those that would cease to emit odors detectable by humans shortly after application. Since many skunk repellents must be reapplied fairly often, we mainly chose products that come in either spray bottles or shakers that can be applied with minimal preparation.</p> <h2>Tips on How to Use a Skunk Repellent</h2> <p>There are a few strategies that help when using skunk repellent to get the most out of the product’s effectiveness. First, be strategic about where you place it. Identify how skunks are coming onto your property, then spray the area so they come into contact with the repellent.</p> <p>Common areas to treat include garbage cans, trees, and gardens, all of which commonly attract skunks. If necessary, create a perimeter around the property with a spray or granules to provide comprehensive protection. Reapply regularly. While it may be a hassle, remember to reapply liquid or granular repellents every few weeks or after it rains to keep skunks at bay.</p> <ul><li>Treat areas that skunks commonly frequent</li><li>Create a perimeter of repellent around the home</li><li>Retreat the area regularly</li></ul>",256
198,fences for dogs,"<p>Not everyone has the time, budget, or even the option to install permanent fencing in their yard. So during our extensive product research for the best fencing for dogs, we wanted to find solutions that would work for renters and homeowners alike as well as for those with large or small yards.</p> <p>Height is obviously a major determining factor when it comes to fences. After all, the taller the fence, the harder it is for dogs to escape. Invisible fences and large playpens offer an alternative for dog owners who don’t want to deal with the installation of a physical fence.</p> <p>We also took into account the overall durability of the fences and whether they required any type of maintenance or upkeep. We only included products that were made from high-quality materials and received positive reviews from other pet parents who value longevity and security, the two most sought-after features of a high-quality fence.</p>",154
199,invisible dog fence,"<p>Having peace of mind when it comes to the safety of your dogs requires a reliable invisible dog fence system. Our top picks for the best options depended upon the coverage area, ease of installation, compatibility with multiple dog sizes, and levels of static.</p> <p>The above picks are all made with ample coverage areas of ⅓-acre to 10 acres for full or partial property coverage. With ample wire or wireless installation, many of these options may take minimal effort to implement and may only take 1-2 days to set up.</p> <p>Plus, many of these options come with waterproof collars with long battery life or can be recharged. Plus, each comes with multiple static settings for the most unruly of dogs. Finally, some of the above picks have training remotes for on-demand control.</p>",132
200,dog repellents,"<p>Years of experience covering home goods as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 dog deterrent options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Type: There are many types of dog repellents on the market. In order to make this guide as comprehensive as possible, we included a wide variety of products designed to prevent and discourage different behaviors.</li><li>Reviews: We included only well-reviewed products on this list, regardless of format, to ensure that they actually perform well and hold up to the manufacturer’s claims.</li><li>Safety: For this piece, we only considered dog repellents that were safe and nontoxic to ensure that they could be used around humans and pets without inadvertently causing any harm.</li></ul>",125
201,pond liners,"<p>Years of experience covering home improvement as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 pond liner options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: The best material for a pond liner varies depending on different factors and consumer preferences, so we included products made of a host of materials among our recommendations.</li><li>Thickness: Though thickness isn’t necessarily an indicator of quality when it comes to pond liners, we still opted to include only models with a minimum thickness of 14 mils.</li><li>Flexible vs. preformed: Both flexible and preformed pond liners have their own advantages, so we included options for both types in this guide.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Installing Pond Liners</h2> <p>Once you’ve designed your pond, dug it out, and chosen a liner, it’s time for the installation process to begin. Here are some tips for installing pond liners:</p> <ul><li>Place a layer of sand down before installing the liner to protect it from sharp rocks and roots.</li><li>Consider using an underlay to add further cushioning.</li><li>Drape the liner over the pond, ensuring an equal overhang on all sides before securing the edges with bricks, rocks, or other heavy materials.</li><li>Fill the pond with water, allowing it to fill the contours of the shape dug for it naturally.</li><li>Once the pond has been filled, trim the excess liner and anchor the edges by burying them or holding them down with stones.</li></ul>",235
202,gas grills under 300,"<p>Since a grill must endure the weather, extreme temperatures, and greasy food, build quality is important when considering any gas grill. Despite their low price point, many of the grills under $300 use similar materials as higher-priced grills. We only chose grills with porcelain-coated iron or stainless steel construction. Since aesthetics are important when it comes to gas grills, models with stainless steel lids and bodies ranked higher than those with painted cast iron. We also limited our selections mainly to grills with cast-iron grates, which offer the best cooking performance.</p> <p>Since heat flux is part and parcel to a gas grill’s ability to cook food evenly, we chose mainly grills with heat flux ratings between 80 and 100. We also favored grills with additional features, such as electronic ignitions, side burners, grill tool storage, and integrated thermometers.</p>",138
203,pool algaecides,"<p>We researched the different types of algaecides and each type of algae it targets. We also considered ease of treatment, frequency of retreatment, and price. Other criteria included the concentration of the algaecide, the ratio of algaecide to gallons per water per treatment, and the frequency of the required treatments.</p> <p>Above all, an algaecide must kill or prevent the targeted algae. While effectiveness is the biggest consideration, non-foaming, non-staining, pool-safe, and swim-safeness are also qualities important to this list of final picks.</p> <h2>Tips for Protecting Your Pool Against Algae</h2> <p>Algae can be a persistent problem; however, you can stay ahead of it. But algaecide is just one factor in algae control. The best way to keep algae from starting is to maintain the pool regularly.</p> <ul><li>Test the pool water weekly. Test and balance the pool water to keep it in the 7.2-to-7.8 pH range.</li><li>Check and maintain the filtration system. Water circulation and filtration are very important. When testing pool water, also check the filtration. Algaecides must circulate throughout the pool to fully coat pool surfaces and tackle all the algae.</li><li>Brush the pool. Algae can start on any surface in the pool. Regularly brush the pool’s bottom, sides, and steps to loosen any algae beginning to grow.</li><li>Perform a weekly shock treatment. Shock treatments reinvigorate the chlorine in the pool and help clear the water. They can alter the chlorine levels for a short while, so wait until the chlorine level stabilizes before adding an algaecide.</li><li>Maintain a regular algaecide treatment schedule. Follow a regular schedule for algaecide treatments. Some algaecides require a weekly treatment, while others may need it only every other week or even longer.</li><li>Keep an eye on everything that enters the pool. Algae can get into the pool through debris or clothing. If swimmers, clothing items, and accessories previously have been in a natural body of water, wash them before they enter the pool.</li></ul>",314
204,suction pool cleaners,"<p>We used several criteria to narrow the field of the more than 20 suction pool cleaners we researched. A good suction pool cleaner should make pool maintenance easier by automating it to some degree. With that in mind, we chose models with proven designs that prevent them from flipping over or becoming hung up on obstacles such as ladders, corners, and steps. Since pool walls make up a significant part of pool cleaning, we stuck with suction pool cleaners that are capable of cleaning the wall as well as the pool bottom. Understanding that budget is always a concern, we included a mix of affordable suction pool cleaners as well as high-end models for those willing to pay for better performance. Finally, our list covers pool cleaners for both inground and above-ground pools.</p> <h2>Suction Pool Cleaner Use and Maintenance Tips</h2> <p>In order for that new pool cleaner to do its job, it’s crucial for it to be maintained properly. Make sure to remove it after each cleaning cycle. The chemicals used to treat pools can damage the pool cleaner if it’s exposed to them for too long. Make sure to clean the pool cleaner after each use. Clean any dirt that accumulates inside, and check to make sure that any wheels or moving parts aren’t clogged with debris. It’s also a good idea to rinse the cleaner with fresh water to prevent pool chemicals from damaging it. Any algae growth on the walls will prevent your pool cleaner from being able to climb. To get the most out of your pool cleaner, control algae growth by making sure your pool chemistry has the proper pH and chlorine levels.</p> <ul><li>Remove the pool cleaner from the pool after each use.</li><li>Regularly remove any debris from the pool cleaner.</li><li>Control algae growth in the pool to ensure the pool cleaner can climb.</li></ul>",307
205,weed killer,"<p>These recommendations for the best weed killer include a variety of products to meet the weed-killing needs of typical users who want to maintain a residential landscape. We narrowed our research to focus primarily on liquid weed killers, as those are some of the most popular on the market due to their ease of use. However, we found that one granular weed killer ranked highest in the pre-emergent category.</p> <p>We also evaluated the weed killers based on how long each product stays in the ground and whether it has pre-emergent or post-emergent action, is selective or nonselective, and works on contact or systemically. While there are broad weed killers ranked on our list that can work quickly and have long-lasting effects, others are designed for killing either a targeted weed type or for targeted placement with little effect on the surrounding landscaping.</p>",142
206,weeding tool,"<p>When selecting the best weeding tools available, we made sure to thoroughly assess each product and only chose tools with high customer satisfaction. The list of top picks takes into account the type of weeder, material, weight, handle and blade design, and other features included by the top brands.</p> <p>To cater to a range of weeding tasks, the list includes both handheld and standing tools. The blades on each tool vary based on purpose, from a handheld garden knife to a long-handled hoe. We prioritized tools with durable steel and fiberglass components, with some options in aluminum. The majority of the weeders on the list have comfortable grips and a lightweight build that make it easier to perform the tasks at hand.</p>",122
207,watering can,"<p>A durable material and strong build ensure that a watering can holds its water and doesn’t leak after a few uses. We looked at material for watering cans that can be used indoors, outdoors, or both. Plastic works indoors or out, but steel holds up better to the elements.</p> <p>Of course, some materials weigh more than others, and a can that holds 3 gallons of water or more can get heavy, so we considered that balance between capacity and heft for various garden uses. And the can should not leak!</p> <p>Handles and spouts matter plenty, not just in how a watering can looks, but also in how easy it is to carry, pour, and control flow of water. For indoor gardens, we looked at cans with long, narrow spouts to direct water only where it’s needed, and we considered the handle design for ergonomics and control. Long-handled and two-handled cans are easier to maneuver.</p>",154
208,landscape fabric,"<p>Extensive research that covered more than 30 different landscaping fabric products helped form the basis for the selection of the best landscape fabrics. However, in order to properly assess each product, it was necessary to take into account the size, material, thickness, and overall quality of each landscape fabric.</p> <p>The size of each landscape fabric product was crucial information to have because the size is the primary factor that influences the price. The larger the landscape fabric, the higher the price. Given that landscape fabrics are separated into three different types, the material was the next aspect to consider. Most products were made with woven fabric, though there were a few standout nonwoven fabric options as well.</p> <p>The durability of the product often comes down to the thickness, so for more heavy-duty jobs, it is necessary to find a thick landscape fabric that can hold the weight without tearing. Some preference was given to products that were made for specific jobs, like increasing stability on a gravel path or serving as an underlay for artificial grass.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Landscape Fabric</h2> <p>When you are adding landscaping fabric to a garden bed, it’s important to take the time to remove all weeds and mix in any compost or soil nutrients that you want to add to the soil before installing the landscaping fabric. Once you have pinned down landscape fabric, it is best not to pull it back up.</p> <p>In addition, you should use a rake or hoe to properly smooth the soil so that the landscaping fabric lays completely flat. Otherwise, it can become difficult to fully cover the fabric with mulch or gravel due to peaks and folds in the fabric.</p> <p>Landscaping fabric is typically secured with pins that pierce the fabric and hold it to the ground, like stakes for a tent. Install these pins once every foot or so to help ensure that the landscape fabric will not be pulled up by scavenging animals or washed out of place in heavy rain.</p> <ul><li>Add compost and soil nutrients before laying down landscaping fabric.</li><li>Smooth the soil to properly install the fabric.</li><li>Install one pin for every foot of landscape fabric.</li></ul>",360
209,compact greenhouse,"<p>We researched the most sought-after small greenhouses in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their design, size, materials, shelving and storage, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best small greenhouses on the market, the most popular types among users were the walk-in, pop-up, vertical, and horizontal models with PCV plastic covers, steel frames, and wire shelving. Not only do these models provide ample durability as well as water and UV resistance, but most also come with 4 to 8 shelves with high weight capacities of up to 27 pounds.</p> <p>While many of these small greenhouses can stand on their own without needing support, select brands provide rope and metal pegs to ensure the unit stays in place. Plus, most of these units have tool-free assembly and are small enough to fit on a porch, in a backyard, or even inside a home.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Small Greenhouse</h2> <p>Mini greenhouses allow gardeners with limited outdoor space to protect their plants from cold weather and overexposure to the sun. The best compact greenhouses serve the same purposes as standard greenhouses within the confines of a small yard, patio, or even a balcony.</p> <p>Standard greenhouses tend to be large and permanent, while mini greenhouses are often portable and offer easy setup, takedown, and storage. Small greenhouses:</p> <ul><li>Protect plants from pests and critters</li><li>Extend the growing season and let you start seedlings earlier</li><li>Shelter plants from the elements</li><li>Allow gardeners to create a controlled microclimate</li><li>Prevent your potting soil from erosion and overwatering by preventing precipitation from reaching your plants.</li></ul>",266
210,pots for succulents,"<p>Growing succulents is easy and rewarding, and choosing the best pots for your succulents increases the chance of success. This starts with proper drainage, a must for making sure the soil around the succulent dries out between waterings.</p> <p>You have to catch that water, too, so an included saucer or tray helps. The pot’s material also can contribute to succulent health, and terra cotta or ceramic pots help the roots breathe and the soil dry. Plastic or resin comes in handy when growing big succulents to cut down on weight.</p> <p>It’s best to select a size only slightly larger than the nursery pot your succulent comes in, so this list includes some small pots for cute little rosettes and medium choices for larger succulents. Finally, design enhances the look of these prized plants. For example, a trailing succulent like String of Pearls shines best in a hanging pot.</p>",148
211,snake repellent,"<p>We researched the most sought-after products to repel snakes in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, coverage area, strength, longevity, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>To ensure each of our top picks could get rid of snakes around homes, pets, and children, the powerful odored and ultrasonic snake repellents listed above are all-natural and safe. Each odored product is made with essential oils like cinnamon, geraniol, castor, peppermint oil, cedarwood, clove oil, rosemary, and more to irritate and repel snakes. Some options even leave a pleasant scent behind for humans. Alternatively, ultrasonic repellers will not irritate your ears or your pets.</p> <p>These picks repel snakes out of 1,200 to 2,100 square feet areas for a few weeks to a month at a time before needing to be reapplied, and most are capable of withstanding light rain. Plus, some of these options have time-release odors, come in easy-to-use spray bottles or pour bags, and some begin working immediately.</p> <h2>Tips For Using Snake Repellent </h2> <p>Snakes are an essential part of the natural world as they help to keep pest populations in check. But most people would rather not be surprised to find them in the backyard or inside the house. Although venomous snake bites are quite rare, they are very serious and sometimes deadly when they do occur. Even a nonvenomous snakebite is painful and can lead to infection or illness. If there is a concern about snakes or snake holes on the property, the first course of action is to eliminate what attracts them.</p> <p>Like other predators, snakes spend most of their lives either pursuing their next meal or resting. Places that commonly attract snakes are ones with food or a sheltered resting place. The most effective way to minimize the risk of snake encounters is to eliminate the habitat that supports snake prey like small rodents and large insects, and areas that snakes can use for shelter.</p> <p>Tallgrass, shrubs with dense foliage to the ground, piles of leaves and sticks, and fallen fruits and nuts make a perfect home for mice and rats, causing these areas to attract snakes. Snakes will come around to find them. A water source such as a decorative landscape pond, or even a low spot that holds water after rain, seals the deal. This is the perfect backyard habitat for snakes.</p> <p>Practice proper yard maintenance to eliminate shelter and food sources that attract snakes and rodents. Mow regularly, remove landscape debris promptly, and clean up fallen fruit and nuts beneath trees.</p> <p>Feed pets indoors, limit bird feeding, and cleanup pet and bird food spills. Don’t keep a year-round firewood pile that can also shelter snakes. Burn up all firewood before snakes become active in spring. Consider eliminating decorative landscape ponds and bird nest boxes, both of which can attract snakes. After removing snake habitat, snake repellent can help keep them away.</p> <ul><li>Snake repellents can get rid of snakes that are still in the area after cleaning up the landscape.</li><li>Snake repellents keep snakes out by creating an unpleasant, unwelcome environment for them.</li><li>It’s nice to get peace of mind, knowing that your home is now a snake-free zone after a few simple changes in habitat and a straightforward application of snake repellent.</li></ul>",546
212,insecticide for vegetable gardens,"<p>Healthy plants are resilient to minor insect infestations. Sometimes, though, outside influences lead to big bug problems, and gardeners may need a little help. When garden ecology gets out of balance, it may be necessary to spray powerful insecticides. The best insecticides may have either synthetic or organic formulas, are long-lasting and effective, and work on an array of noxious pests.</p> <p>The above list includes natural and chemical formulas that are made to target specific pest types or a variety of insects at once. Many are also odorless; leave no residue; and are safe for multiple plant, lawn, and houseplant types. Plus, some select options can be used indoors or outdoors.</p> <p>The above bug killers also avoid damaging beneficial insects while being safe to use around people, children, and animals. Be advised that some do not come with sprayers and require dilution before use.</p>",144
213,mosquito repellent,"<p>Whether you are looking for a light-duty mosquito repellent for the backyard or need a heavy-duty, all-insect protectant for camping, finding the right insect repellent can help to prevent pesky bug bites and contracting potential diseases. Selections for the best mosquito repellents depended upon type, ingredients, quantity, application, and longevity.</p> <p>Chemical, natural, and technological repellents are tried and tested methods for deterring mosquitos, with the chemical options being the most popular. These formulas are infused with DEET and IR3535 for effective pest control, while the natural options include castor, lemongrass, rosemary, cedarwood, and peppermint oil, some of which are safe for young children.</p> <p>As for size and quantity, each of the above options comes with enough insect repellent to last through multiple daytime trips or camping adventures. All these repellents are also easy to use with spray nozzles, disposable wipes, or replaceable repellent mats. Finally, most of the above chemical and natural picks are made to last for 2-10 hours, while the technological offers over 15 hours of insect-free time.</p>",170
214,potting soil,"<p>After researching the correct nutrients for successful potted plant growth, the types of soils offered, and the considerations that every successful plant owner should have, the above list could satisfy any and all plants in their growth from seed to bloom.</p> <p>Based on the thoughtful ingredients included in every mix, including Canadian sphagnum peat moss, perlite, and wetting agents, the slow release nature of many of the plant foods within, and the trustworthiness of these well-known brands in the eyes of their life-long customer base.</p> <p>Many of these mixes are also made to be used in both indoor and outdoor environments for maximum versatility, while the lightweight nature of some of the soils helps for portability when pouring or re-potting. Overall, each of these options was selected due to user-friendliness and all-around reliability in growing potted plants.</p> <h2>How to Use Potting Soil</h2> <p>Potting soil is an all-in-one growing medium, so gardeners don’t need to add other types of soil or amendments to improve it. To repot a plant: Place a small amount of potting soil in the bottom of the new container, add the plant so the upper surface of its root ball is about ½ inch lower than the top of the pot, and firm in additional soil around the root ball until the soil is level with the root ball surface. Water thoroughly to eliminate air pockets, and it’s good to go.</p> <p>Potting soil comes in different-size bags, typically in quarts or cubic feet. Common sizes are 4, 8, and 16 quarts, as well as 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cubic feet. For the sake of comparison, there are approximately 30 quarts in a cubic foot. Below is a list of standard pot sizes and the amount of potting soil it takes to fill each size. The measurements reflect the pot diameter inside the rim. Since pot volume changes with shape, consider this a guideline only.</p> <ul><li>4-inch pots use about 0.5 quart of soil.</li><li>6-inch pots use approximately 1 quart of soil.</li><li>8-inch pots use about 3 quarts of soil.</li><li>10-inch pots use around 5 quarts of soil.</li><li>12-inch pots use approximately 12 quarts of soil.</li><li>14-inch pots use about 18 quarts of soil.</li></ul>",360
215,rose fertilizer,"<p>Rose lovers should look at the type of fertilizer and determine how they prefer to apply the food to their plants. We considered type and ease of use for each product we analyzed. The NPK ratio measures the three macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), and we looked for balanced formulas or those with a little more phosphorus to encourage blooming.</p> <p>All of the products in this list have organic ingredients to provide balanced nutrients and improve overall soil health. Most of these formulas include microbes, which help rose shrubs use the nutrients that fertilizers provide.</p> <h2>FAQs About Rose Fertilizer </h2> <p>Are you looking for quick and concise answers to your rose fertilization questions? If so, check out the FAQs below.</p> <h3>Q. How do you fertilize roses?</h3> <p>Depending on the type of fertilizer used, you either “scratch” into the soil beneath your plants, pour it into the soil at the bases of those plants, or spray it on their foliage. If you opt for fertilizer spikes, you dig and drive the spike into the ground near the root.</p> <h3>Q. How do you know if roses need fertilizer?</h3> <p>If your plants appear stunted with yellowish, purplish, or burnt-looking leaves, they may be suffering from lack of nutrients.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you fertilize roses?</h3> <p>It varies from once every week to once every two months, depending on the type of fertilizer used.</p> <h3>Q. What is the best time to fertilize roses?</h3> <p>Begin fertilizing in early spring and conclude six to eight weeks before the date of your usual first autumn frost.</p> <h3>Q. What nutrients do roses need most?</h3> <p>Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are considered the most essential nutrients.</p>",275
216,pitchforks,"<p>When it comes to choosing the best pitchfork, we relied on extensive product research to ensure we’re suggesting the best of the best models. Here’s how we did it:</p> <ul><li>First, we looked for pitchforks made from the best materials. We looked for products made from steel, fiberglass, and other high-quality materials.</li><li>Then, we looked for pitchforks that utilized ergonomic designs to ensure they’re easy to use.</li><li>Finally, we broke the contenders up into several categories to offer only the best of each type.</li></ul> <p>The result of all this research is a complete list of some of the best pitchforks on the market.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Pitchfork</h2> <p>Pitchforks are highly useful and versatile tools when put to work on the lawn or in the garden:</p> <ul><li>Pitchforks can aerate your soil. If your garden’s soil becomes too compacted, water and oxygen won’t make their way into the soil, which could cause your plants to suffer. A pitchfork can plunge into the soil and provide a little wiggle room for moisture and air, increasing the quality of the soil.</li><li>A pitchfork can be a big help when it comes to turning and spreading compost as well. The flat tines of digging forks make it easier to turn large piles over while also allowing you to pick up and spread the compost over a garden. Very fine compost might require a five- or six-tine fork, however.</li><li>These tools can simply loosen soil for digging. When it comes to digging trenches for pipes or wires in hard-packed soil, a pitchfork can be indispensable. By plunging the tines into the ground as you go, you’ll be able to loosen the dirt quickly, making digging a much easier process.</li></ul>",280
217,gardening books,"<p>With thousands of gardening books to choose from, stretching back many, many years, we set a few criteria to limit our choices. The best gardening book to improve your green thumb should cover either broadly relevant gardening basics that any prospective grower should learn, or they should offer solutions to gardening problems. Some may offer both. In either case, the information must be scientifically accurate and up to date.</p> <p>We reached out to dozens of gardeners to find out which books they found most helpful as they were starting out, especially their picks as the best gardening books for beginners. Next we scoured the New York Times best sellers lists for the past three decades. We also checked in with a local librarian to find out what’s on the shelves and which titles see the most action. After compiling our master list, we eliminated anything out of print, outdated, or unrelated to our criteria.</p> <p>There were still more books than we could list here, making it difficult to narrow down the best gardening books of all time. Our final picks favored organic growing practices because the literature emphasizes an ecosystem approach to gardening that gives the reader a fuller understanding of gardening’s big picture. If you want to learn more about things like beneficial microbes in soil or garden predator-prey relationships, the best resources come from the organic realm at this time, making them good options for those interested in backyard gardening books.</p>",243
218,soil for raised beds,"<p>We researched the most sought-after soil for raised beds in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their ingredients, quantity, versatility, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best garden bed soil, we found that the most popular types among users were the ones made with organic materials including peat, coir, perlite, worm castings, compost, and more. Many of these mixes are formulated to provide drainage and aeration and select options can be used for indoor and outdoor plants, vegetables, fruits, flowers, and herbs.</p> <p>Whether you need 1 cubic foot or over 15 gallons of soil, the above list includes options that resist compacting, are pH-balanced, and can be used on existing soil with grown plants as well as seedlings.</p>",130
219,mulch,"<p>The best mulch is durable, long lasting, and able to keep weeds and invasive insects away. We looked at the wide range of mulch types available and provided our top picks for the most popular types, including straw, wood chips, coco coir, and rubber, as well as the best landscape fabrics, in order to cover a broad spectrum of intended applications.</p> <p>Our research found that certain shoppers prefer organic mulch to help add nutrients to the soil as they slowly break down over time, but we are aware that longevity is also a major consideration for other shoppers, who prefer inorganic options that will stand the test of time. Our list of recommendations spans these two preferences to provide several options for each category.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Using Mulch </h2> <p>Why use mulch? There are many advantages to using this material in your garden and landscaping beds. Here’s why you should consider adding mulch to your gardening tool kit:</p> <ul><li>Conserve water. Water loss is inevitable in a garden, especially at the peak of the hot weather with the sun beating down on your beds. Adding mulch can help conserve moisture and prevent water loss that occurs due to evaporation. You won’t have to deal with rapidly drying soil as much if you use mulch, and you can save some water.</li><li>Regulate temperature. It can be hard to manage soil temperatures throughout the season, especially as the weather fluctuates. Adding mulch around the root zones of your plants can help regulate soil temperature. In the hot weather, mulch cools the soil, and in the cooler months, mulch keeps plant roots warm.</li><li>Add nutrients and improve soil. Adding organic mulches can help improve the nutrient content of soil over time. Organic mulch breaks down slowly and improves the condition and texture of soil.</li><li>Prevent disease. A lot of beneficial organisms live in the soil, but so do a bunch of nasty ones. Many fungal diseases find their way onto and into plants because of splashing water. Mulch acts as a barrier between plant foliage and contaminated soil.</li><li>Beautify your garden. Mulch also helps tie landscaping spaces together. Wood chips, rubber mulch, and rocks or gravel are most often used for aesthetic purposes. They are available in several colors, from natural to red.</li></ul> <h2>FAQs About Your New Mulch </h2> <p>Do you still have questions about landscaping mulch? Here are some answers to frequently asked mulch questions.</p> <h3>Q. Is all mulch organic? </h3> <p>No, not all mulch is organic. Some mulches are made of inorganic materials. These synthetic mulches have their place in gardening and agriculture, though, and have many benefits. They’re easy to apply, effective, and sometimes cost less per square foot than some organic mulches, like wood chips.</p> <h3>Q. What are the types of mulch? </h3> <p>There are two main types of mulch, organic and inorganic. Here’s a full list of all the kinds of mulch you can use in your garden:</p> <ul><li>Compost</li><li>Straw</li><li>Hay</li><li>Coco coir</li><li>Shredded newspaper</li><li>Cardboard</li><li>Shredded leaves</li><li>Pine needles</li><li>Stones, pebbles, rocks</li><li>Sawdust</li><li>Crushed seashells</li><li>Grass clippings</li><li>Wood chips</li><li>Tree bark</li><li>Landscaping fabric</li><li>Black or red plastic mulch</li><li>Rubber mulch (sometimes called rubberwood chips)</li></ul> <h3>Q. What type of mulch lasts the longest? </h3> <p>Inorganic mulches are the longest lasting, which makes them good for permanent garden plants, beds, or paths. Rubber and landscaping fabric won’t break down like other types of mulch. Landscaping fabric eventually needs replacing, though, but not for years.</p> <p>The longest lasting of them all? Stones, rocks, and pebbles by far. Just know that rocks have disadvantages. They’re heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to remove if you decide to change your garden around.</p> <h3>Q. Does mulching grass make it grow faster? </h3> <p>Mulching grass can help improve the nutrient availability for your lawn and help it grow healthier. Hold on, though. Grass mulching doesn’t involve just any type of mulch. It specifically requires finely chopped-up grass clippings or an organic compost. In addition to adding nutrients, mulching your lawn can help with moisture retention, which, in turn, can help you reduce your water use and save money on your water bill.</p> <h3>Q. Do I need to pull weeds before mulching? </h3> <p>You don’t need to, but it’s a good idea. You’ll get better results if you weed before applying mulch. Weeds are considered garden intruders for a reason. They’re hard to get rid of. While you might get lucky, pulling them up helps keep them from popping up again in the future. When pulling weeds, you have to get them by the taproot. Simply cutting them at the soil line won’t permanently kill them.</p> <h3>Q. How often should you remove old mulch?</h3> <p>According to lawn-care company Reddi Lawn Care, you should reapply mulch every five or six years. You might need to replace mulch sooner or add some depth for various reasons, such as if an area has heavy foot traffic.</p>",789
220,plant food,"<p>The best plant foods are capable of producing visible results in a relatively short period of time and avoid burning or overstimulating the plant. This list of recommendations strives to span the wide range of plant varieties and their needs, both as indoor and outdoor plants, to provide shoppers with concise choices they can make, depending on their individual needs.</p> <p>Our research took into consideration the various forms of plant food to provide our top picks for continuous release, liquid, and water-soluble plant foods. We have also made sure to include both organic and synthetic options with varying longevity. Since certain shoppers prefer a product they can add to every watering session, while others would rather apply a slow-release capsule that works over long periods of time, we have included options that can meet all these different needs.</p> <h2>FAQs About Your New Plant Food</h2> <p>Check out the frequently asked questions below to answer any questions you still have about plant food, and learn more about using plant food to help your plants grow.</p> <h3>Q. What helps plants grow faster? </h3> <p>An inorganic fertilizer can help plants grow quickly. These treatments release nutrients into the soil immediately, which will help encourage plant growth. Organic fertilizers are a good option for creating healthy soil, but they don’t release nutrients into the soil as quickly and may not foster fast growth.</p> <h3>Q. Is plant food the same thing as fertilizer? </h3> <p>No, plant food is not the same as fertilizer. Plants are able to create their own food from carbon dioxide, water, and energy from the sun. Fertilizers include nutrients that can help plants stay healthy, produce chlorophyll, break down carbohydrates, grow, and so much more.</p> <h3>Q. Should I feed my plants every time I water them? </h3> <p>You don’t need to feed your plants each time you water them, but you may choose to do so. Consult your plant food’s packaging for the manufacturer’s application recommendations.</p> <h3>Q. What time of day is best to feed plants? </h3> <p>Many experts recommend feeding plants in the morning. Typically, during the morning hours there is less wind to blow away any food you’ve put in the soil. If you wait until the hottest part of the day, your plants may be stressed from the heat, which means they may not be able to absorb as many nutrients.</p> <h3>Q. How long does plant food take to work?</h3> <p>The amount of time it will take plant food to work can vary based on a few different factors. These factors include the type of plant you’re growing, the type of plant food you’re using, and the other growing conditions, such as sunlight and water.</p>",442
221,planters,"<p>Planters come in a large selection of styles, shapes, colors, materials, and sizes. Shoppers are spoiled for choice when it comes to planters, so choosing the right one can feel overwhelming.</p> <p>For most shoppers, aesthetics is a top priority when choosing a planter. A planter should double as a decor piece while also keeping your plant healthy. Style is very individual, but we made sure to choose attractive and versatile pieces that will suit various decor types.</p> <p>Through product research, we also examined the planter materials, construction, and functionality. We chose planters with sturdy and thick materials (flimsy planters look cheap and won’t last). When needed, most of the products on this list included any necessary parts and hardware, like mounting hardware or drip trays.</p>",125
222,garden trowel,"<p>When preparing our list of recommended garden trowels, we took note of selling points to look out for, as well as the pitfalls to avoid. To that end, we came up with a list of tools that cover the range of needs that we identified, namely comfort during use and their ability to resist bending.</p> <p>Some users will be stronger than others, so we made sure to provide options for those who need a tool that puts up a good fight against tough roots or hard soil.

The plethora of different shapes and material options can overwhelm even the most dedicated gardener. This list contains some considerations to keep in mind when choosing a quality garden trowel.</p> <h3>Material </h3> <p>Trowel blades are made of stainless steel, carbon steel, or aluminum.</p> <ul><li>Stainless steel blades often are made in a single piece, which makes the blade strong and more resistant to bending, breaking, or rusting.</li><li>Carbon steel, one of the strongest materials, doesn’t rust and is virtually impossible to break.</li><li>Aluminum is lighter, which makes it better suited to light tasks, such as potting, rather than digging into rocky ground.</li></ul> <p>Garden trowel handles are manufactured of wood, plastic, or fiberglass.</p> <ul><li>Wood handles are sturdy, and if the wood is high quality and kept out of the elements, they can last a long time.</li><li>Plastic handles comprise a plastic-layered metal blade or a separate plastic blade. Over time, plastic handles and parts can break off the trowel.</li><li>Fiberglass handles are made with tough fiberglass resin. Unlike wood, this material doesn’t shrink or expand with changes in humidity.</li></ul> <h3>Blade </h3> <p>The shape of the blade, which may be flat, curved, or scooped, helps gardeners complete various garden tasks. Blade styles include traditional, transplanting, potting, digging, and planting.</p> <ul><li>Traditional blades have a rounded or slightly pointed end.</li><li>Transplanting blades are longer and narrower so they can get deep enough to remove a plant and its roots.</li><li>Potting blades, which have a pronounced concave curve, help transfer soil from one location to another.</li><li>Digging blades generally have a wider trowel blade with a scoop shape for digging up plants or digging holes.</li><li>Planting blades traditionally have a pointier tip for digging and planting in tighter places.</li></ul> <h3>Handle</h3> <p>The best garden trowels incorporate a good length and decent grip, and they offer an ergonomic design to provide the best performance in every type of soil condition.</p> <ul><li>Handle length affects how the tool feels in the hand and can contribute to or decrease pressure on the palm. Too short, and the handle causes pressure on the hand and less room to grip. A handle should be a minimum of 4 inches, but closer to 5.5 inches provides the best ergonomic benefits.</li><li>The grip makes the trowel more comfortable and easier to hold. Handles with cylindrical or oval shapes instead of flat edges typically offer the best grip.</li><li>Ergonomic handles help gardeners perform repetitive tasks easier and safer and help reduce muscle injury or strain. Ergonomic handles minimize flexing, extending, and radial deviation of the wrist (bending or twisting of the wrist toward the thumb) by creating a neutral wrist posture.</li></ul> <h3>Additional Features </h3> <p>Some additional features affect garden trowel capabilities, including weight, handle holes, and sharpening.</p> <ul><li>Trowel weight affects how gardeners use the tool. Look for a trowel that weighs 3 pounds or less, but optimally, a trowel should weigh less than 1 pound.</li><li>Some trowel handles have holes at the bottom for storage that make it easy to hang the trowel on a hook in the garden shed or garage.</li><li>The metal construction of most trowels makes it easy to sharpen, so gardeners can keep them in working order when the edges start to dull.</li></ul>",1241
223,grow bag,"<p>For grow bags to do their job, they must come in a material that lets in air and lets out some moisture so water doesn’t pool at the roots. Of course, with these features, grow bags can be a little floppy, so we looked at bags that should be sturdy enough to support the weight of soil and plant. Portability can come into play for those who might need to move a plant in a grow bag. Most of the choices in this list include reinforced handles.</p> <p>Size matters, and it really depends on plant preferences and space available. We noted whether a bag is too small for growing large vegetables, but big enough for transplants or annual herbs. As a bonus, some bags, like these 7-gallon bags from Nicheo, have a window. Although not a necessity, this is a great feature when growing root crops like potatoes and carrots so growers can see if they’re ready to harvest. It also can help keep kids interested in gardening; they can peek at what goes on beneath the soil.</p>",178
224,weed torch,"<p>Weed torches are a valuable part of maintenance in your garden, yard, and even in other parts of your outdoor spaces. Finding one that has high-power, is lightweight and portable, requires little assembly, and is safe to light and use is key if you want to get the job done right.</p> <p>After looking at many of the best weed torches available, our picks offer thoughtful and effective features and designs such as self-igniting triggers, gripped handles, lightweight materials, and even bells to protect your delicate plants while you kill those pesky weeds.</p> <p>One other factor that comes into play is a weed torch’s ability to be eco-friendly. Many of the picks above are fueled by propane canisters that can be refilled for less waste and convenience.</p> <p>Those looking for a safe and effective way to eliminate weeds from their yard or garden can benefit from the ergonomic, safely-designed weed torches listed above.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Weed Torch</h2> <p>In general, a quick blast of heat will break down the cells that weeds need to grow, even if they don’t turn completely black. The best time to use a weed torch is on a wind-still day after a good soaking rain. While weed torches are safe if used properly, the soaked terrain will help reduce the risk of an accident and low wind speeds help keep the flames controllable.</p> <p>Always keep a hose or a bucket of water nearby while burning weeds, and remove leaves and debris from the area before torching the weeds. Leaves and debris will burn much faster than weeds, and passing over them with a lit torch can lead to an unintended fire in no time.</p> <ul><li>A quick pass of heat is often enough to kill a weed without charring it to embers.</li><li>Wait for days after rain with low winds before setting out to torch weeds.</li><li>Keep water on hand and remove leaves and debris before torching weeds.</li></ul>",320
225,organic fertilizer,"<p>We narrowed our results for the best organic fertilizers based on the variety of ingredients, effectiveness, application method, and ease of use. Some are made with animal byproducts, which are known to provide excellent fertilization benefits, and others are made with minerals or microbial ingredients. Purists might prefer the animal-based products, but the smell may be too much for some, which is why our top recommendation is a granular fertilizer. It’s easy to apply to many kinds of outdoor plants.</p> <p>We also considered the type of application: dry, liquid, or foliar application. Buyers should be comfortable applying their preferred fertilizer, so we’ve included options to suit most preferences. Certain fertilizers are easy to apply once each season, while others require bimonthly application for best results, which may appeal to green-thumb gardeners.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Using Organic Fertilizer</h2> <p>Organic fertilizer supplies the nutrients that plants need in a naturally slow-release form, at a rate at which plants can use them. The plant food is made available through the biological action of beneficial microbes that work together with plants. Microbes consume the organic fertilizer ingredients and release the nutrients in a form from which the plants can benefit.</p> <p>Plants shed leaves and roots that become soil organic matter that microbes can colonize. A healthy soil ecosystem includes a diverse array of life that helps manage this organic matter. Earthworms and beetles consume and break down dead plant material at the soil surface and carry it to the plant root where the microbes complete the cycle.</p> <p>A residual effect of the beneficial microbes is their ability to reproduce and work within the natural nutrient cycling system. When managed well, an organic system increases the carbon content of the soil over time. The increased soil carbon, in the form of humus, enhances fertilizer efficiency by absorbing water and nutrients that would otherwise runoff.</p> <ul><li>Organic fertilizer feeds plants at a naturally slow, steady rate.</li><li>Organic fertilizer supports healthy, diverse soil ecology.</li><li>Organic fertilizer increases fertilizer efficiency.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using Organic Fertilizer</h2> <p>The key to effectively using organic fertilizer lies in understanding how it works. It takes time and warm temperatures for soil microbes to consume the product and then release plant-ready nutrients. In cool weather, it may take up to 6 weeks to see results, but 2 weeks is typical during the growing season.</p> <p>Once applied, these naturally slow-acting products continue to feed through the whole gardening season. Get an early start by fertilizing at the time of planting seeds or 2 weeks before planting seedlings. The microbes that make these fertilizers available live within the soil.</p> <p>Incorporate the fertilizer into the top 3 to 6 inches of the soil where they can access it. Use liquid organic fertilizer to supplement granular fertilizer when crops need a boost of nutrients, as when cabbage plants begin to form heads or when tomatoes begin to set fruit.</p> <ul><li>Incorporate organic fertilizer into the soil for best results.</li><li>Apply granular organic fertilizer once at the beginning of the season.</li><li>Use liquid organic fertilizer when plants need more nutrition.</li></ul>",505
226,fertilizer for peppers,"<p>To grow robust peppers and other types of vegetables, the plants need a little help. We analyzed fertilizer types and contents to determine which offered various benefits and at what stage of plant growth. Some formulas help plants get a good start, and others feed slowly over time. We also looked at the form of fertilizer and included a mix on this list, including a liquid, granular, water-soluble, and spike pick. Each has benefits and drawbacks, depending on gardener preference. We also noted whether products contained chemical-only or natural ingredients, including a few that are certified organic.</p> <h2> FAQs About Fertilizer For Peppers</h2> <p>Fertilizers add vital nutrients to the soil and encourage high vegetable production. Still, new gardeners likely have some questions about which type of fertilizer to use and how often to apply it.</p> <h3>Q. When should I fertilizer my peppers?</h3> <p>This varies by the specific fertilizer; in general, fertilizer can be added at transplant time and then every few weeks afterward throughout the growing season.</p> <h3>Q. What nutrients do pepper plants need?</h3> <p>Peppers, like tomatoes and other veggies, require nitrogen for robust plant growth, phosphorus for increasing the plant’s ability to store energy, and potassium to help the plant resist disease. Depending on the soil content, peppers also might need a fertilizer that contains calcium, magnesium, or iron.</p> <h3>Q. Can you overfertilize pepper plants?</h3> <p>For the best results, carefully follow the feeding instructions on the package. While peppers thrive with fertilizer, mixing it into too strong a formula can burn leaves if applied to foliage, and feeding too often can lead to yellowing of the lower leaves, dropped leaves, and slow growth.</p>",273
227,soil for roses,"<p>Drainage and nutrients top the must-have list for soil to support indoor-grown roses. We looked at the type of soil and ingredients to ensure good drainage and feeding. In particular, roses need nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium in the soil or through fertilizing. The addition of organic matter like compost also contributes to nutrition for indoor roses.</p> <p>Soil also needs to let air reach the roots, so perlite, coir, or other light materials help keep soil from compacting around roots. Aside from good drainage, the soil should not dry so quickly that drought affects the roses, so moisture control is an important feature to consider. Some potting mixes are more susceptible to fungal growth in the bag or once in a pot, but those that boast good drainage are less prone to fungus and gnats.</p> <h2><b>FAQs About Soil for Roses</b></h2> <p>Once you’ve found the best soil for growing roses indoors, it’s time to start planting. But first, check out some of the most frequently asked questions about potting soil for indoor roses.</p> <h3><b>Q. What type of soil does a rose grow best in?</b></h3> <p>Roses thrive in soil that drains well and is properly aerated, which makes ingredients such as coir and peat moss useful.</p> <h3><b>Q. How do I make soil acidic for roses?</b></h3> <p>Adding compost to soil is an excellent way to make it more acidic for roses. It’ll also help provide roses with more of the nutrients they need to flourish.</p> <h3><b>Q. Do roses like acidic or alkaline soil?</b></h3> <p>Roses prefer soil with a pH of around 6.5, which is slightly acidic but close to neutral soil.</p> <h3><b>Q. Why is my indoor rose plant dying?</b></h3> <p>There could be several reasons. It may not be receiving enough light; indoor roses need about six hours of full sun each day. You may be watering it too much or too little. Another possibility is that you may need to repot the plant to ensure the soil still contains enough nutrients—annual repotting is recommended by some soil manufacturers.</p>",334
228,citrus fertilizer,"<p>Citrus fertilizers are formulated to address the specific needs of orange, grapefruit, and lemon trees, which differ from other types of trees. The tree’s age, how recently it was planted, and the soil’s natural nutrient content are all important to think about when selecting the best citrus fertilizer. We considered nutrient content, whether formulations were organic, and the form in which the fertilizer comes to compile this carefully curated list of the best citrus fertilizers. Form is a matter of convenience for some citrus tree growers, so we included different types.</p> <p>In addition, gardeners should be aware of the best time to fertilize citrus trees in their growing region, which might affect fertilizer choice. When used as directed, these fertilizers should give citrus lovers the result they desire—robust root development, healthy foliage, and ample fruit production.</p>",136
229,brush killer,"<p>Brush, poison ivy, weeds, stumps, and other harmful plants can damage the integrity and aesthetic of your outdoor space and plants. The right brush killer can remove all noxious plants with the aid of potent ingredients, long working times, and water resistance.</p> <p>Many of the above picks are made with triclopyr, glyphosate, 2,4-D, or mixes of these chemicals for effective weed killing. Some are also made with weed-preventing chemicals to keep noxious plants from regrowing. Though most of these options do not come with spray nozzles or wands, each is potent and comes with rainproof abilities to last through most weather conditions.</p> <p>The above selection is also versatile, as most mixes are able to kill a variety of harmful plant types simultaneously and the effects can last for up to 1 year after application. Many of the above picks require dilution before using so most come in lightweight quantities, but many are also offered in multiple size options.</p>",158
230,dandelion killer,"<p>Having the perfect lawn comes with using a strong and effective dandelion and weed killer. All of the above top picks are made to successfully kill weeds and prevent new growth, are easy to use and spread, and even aid in healthy grass growth.</p> <p>Made with selective herbicides, nitrogen-rich mixes, or natural vinegar, each of our top picks kills hundreds of known weed types. Some also incorporate fertilizers that aid in growing new grass. Though some of these mixes are meant to be applied with a spreader, seeder, or sprayer, each is easy to use and some only require one or two applications for long-term weed prevention.</p> <p>Plus, most of these mixes are made to be compatible with many types of grass. Be advised, however, that some of these mixes are not suitable for use on certain grass types and contain chemicals that may not be safe for pets and children.</p> <p>Additionally, some of these top picks can kill all vegetation they come in contact with, so careful application is recommended.</p>",171
231,solar post cap lights,"<p>Solar lights can add safety and ambiance to entryways, gardens, patios, and other outdoor spaces with no cords or wiring required. To work well, they need to charge within typical daylight hours and last as long as you need them to, hopefully up to 8 hours. Aside from battery and charging time, we looked at brightness, which is measured in lumens, to offer a range of choices. You might want one bright light or a set of several that add just enough light to provide some safety while still allowing you to see stars.</p> <p>Since these lights sit outside in the sun and rain or snow, they need to hold up, so we analyzed materials and weather resistance when choosing the best solar post cap lights. Most cap lights are designed to fit over a fence top or deck post, so check measurements when deciding. Finally, this list offers several aesthetic choices to match modern, garden, or vintage styles.</p> <h2>FAQs About Solar Post Cap Lights </h2> <p>Before investing in a new solar post cap light, take a look at these frequently asked questions and their answers to learn more about how solar lights function and how long they will last before needing to be replaced.</p> <h3>Q. Do solar post lights work if it’s cloudy all day?</h3> <p>While direct sunlight is the best way to quickly charge a solar post cap light, indirect daylight, even when it’s cloudy, will also charge the solar battery, just not at the same speed.</p> <h3>Q. Do solar post lights come with batteries?</h3> <p>While you won’t have to worry about regularly replacing disposable batteries, a solar post light still comes with one or more rechargeable batteries inside.</p> <h3>Q. How long does a solar post cap light last?</h3> <p>A solar post cap light can last between 2 and 8 years, depending on the frequency of use, the replaceability of the battery, and whether it’s somewhat sheltered or completely exposed to any and all weather conditions.</p>",327
232,oriole feeder,"<p>Attracting orioles can be easy with the best oriole feeders, but enjoying songbirds comes with a little effort. We looked at capacity and types of food a feeder could hold to cut down on refill and cleaning time when possible. The material needs to hold up to oriole traffic and sun, rain, and wind, so coated metal and weather-resistant wood typically last longer. Plastic feeders cost less but vary in quality.</p> <p>The type of feeder can make a difference since bird lovers must refill either jelly, oranges, nectar, or mealworms (when orioles are feeding young). Several of these picks support more than one of these feed types. Sticky jelly, nectar, or orange juice drips lead to frequent cleaning, so ease of cleaning was a top consideration when evaluating oriole feeders. Most of these choices come in bright orange to attract these birds instead of wasps.</p>",145
233,slug killer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after products for slug control in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their form, ingredients, coverage area, ease of application, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best slug killers available, the most popular type among users was the granular options for their effectiveness and ease of use. Made with powerful iron phosphate, sulphur, ferric EDTA, and spinosad, these formulas are able to deter slugs, and even snails, within 1,000 to 17,000 feet and within a number of days.</p> <p>As for ease of use, select products included in our list come with precision applicators. Plus, many of the above formulas are safe to use in homes with children and pets.</p>",125
234,bird feeders for cardinals,"<p>Cardinals are a medium-size bird, so finding the right-size bird feeder for them is important. These recommendations include feeders that easily accommodate these birds and many others their size or smaller. Our favorites include the most popular designs like platforms, hoppers, window feeders, tubes, and houses that can hold suet cakes. Some designs prevent excess spillage on the ground, while others allow it; this attracts other larger birds that don’t mind feeding on the ground. Each feeder has a water draining system to prevent moisture from spoiling the birdseed when it rains, which is helpful for preventing waste.</p> <p>We researched products that had squirrel-proof designs to prevent extreme competition for resources, and we looked for styles that had plenty of access for cardinals’ preferred safflower seeds. Additionally, we narrowed our choices to include different size capacities, materials, and feeding ports. We included bird feeders at several price points as well.</p>",150
235,fertilizers for hydrangeas,"<p>To keep hydrangeas growing and blooming bountifully, you need a fertilizer or soil amender that’s made specifically for these acid-loving plants. Our recommendations include a variety of options to help improve the health and beauty of these plants. We’ve selected traditional water- soluble fertilizers that help stimulate root growth, granular fertilizers with microbes and fish meal, and soil amenders that help increase the soil’s acidity to achieve blue flowers. As a bonus, we also included an all-in-one product that is an effective pesticide and fertilizer that also helps plants resist common diseases.</p> <p>We’ve included some low-cost options, too; however, they may require frequent application for effective fertilization all season. Our favorite options effectively increase the bloom rate of hydrangeas, and gardeners can choose between organic and non-organic products.</p>",128
236,soil for monstera,"<p>Our top picks for the best soil for monstera plants encourage plant health. The best soil should retain moisture but still drain well so the plant will thrive. Some of these soils contain fertilizers, but if they don’t, it’s easy to add additional fertilizer if needed. To determine the best soil for monstera plants, we focused on ingredients such as coco coir, peat moss, vermiculite, and perlite since these ingredients encourage optimal growth and root development. Additional factors include added nutrients, how well the soil drains and stays aerated, how well it retains moisture, and since monsteras like slightly acidic soil, the pH level. Our picks for the best soil for monstera plants will encourage healthy leaf and root growth while maintaining optimal moisture retention and drainage.</p>",127
237,seed starting mix,"<p>We researched the most sought-after seed starting mixes in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their ingredients, form, quantity provided, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best seeding mix available, the most effective and popular types among users for outdoor and indoor plant growth were potting soil mixes, pods, and sponges. These mixes included coconut coir, sphagnum peat moss, perlite, fertilizer, wetting agents, and even compost.</p> <p>The seeding mixes allow for drainage, water-retention, root cutting, and transplanting while young seeds begin to grow. Many come with large quantities of up to 16 quarts or 50 pods or sponges. Plus, the majority of these picks are 100 percent certified organic seed starters.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Seed-Starting Mix</h2> <p>Use a seed-starting mix rather than soil or potting mix to increase seed germination and get tiny seedlings off to a healthy start. Employ these tips to simplify the process and increase success.</p> <ul><li>Empty dry mix in a large bowl and stir in water to moisten the mixture before filling a seed flat or seed pots with the mix.</li><li>If the tap water is high in mineral content, consider using distilled water to avoid creating a high alkaline pH environment.</li><li>Consider wearing a dust mask when working with a dry seed-starting mix since some contain powdery, fine elements that can become airborne.</li></ul>",228
238,grub killer,"<p>These recommendations for the best grub control products include a variety of products to meet the grub-killing needs of typical users who want to maintain an insect-free residential landscape. We narrowed our research to focus primarily on granular grub killers, as those are some of the most popular on the market due to their versatility and effectiveness. However, we found that one liquid grub killer ranked highest for ease of use.</p> <p>We also evaluated the grub killers based on how long each product stays in or on the ground and grass and if they kill on-contact or systemically, as many kill grubs on-contact and continue to last all season long. Plus, some of these products are capable of covering 5,000 square feet or more, killing grubs throughout lawns and gardens and simultaneously fertilizing the space.</p> <p>While there are a broad number of grub killers ranked on our list that can work quickly and have long-lasting effects, others are designed for killing insects such as ticks, Japanese beetles, crickets, ants, and many more to reduce grub damage and crate an overall insect-free landscape.</p>",182
239,weed barrier,"<p>There are several important features to consider when choosing a weed barrier, but most gardeners would narrow it down to a couple of features: effectiveness and durability. The weed barriers on this list are made from materials (like polypropylene) that do an excellent job of providing weed control. Durability is also important to home gardeners; no one wants to spend time installing a weed barrier just to have it tear or degrade after only one season.</p> <p>Based on thorough product research, brand reputation, materials, and online reviews, the weed barriers on this list are durable enough to last several seasons—and some even come with anywhere from 5 to 30 years of guaranteed weed protection. We also included a variety of sizing, barrier types, and UV-protected options on this list to better enable you to find a suitable choice for your garden.</p> <h2>How to Install a Weed Barrier</h2> <p>Installing a weed barrier is relatively straightforward. First, measure the area where you intend to lay the weed barrier in order to calculate the number of rolls you need—and as with most home projects, it doesn’t hurt to buy a little extra. Make sure to choose a weed barrier that is suitable for your intended use; for example, choose a thicker and impermeable barrier for under pathways compared to a thinner, permeable barrier for a garden bed. Once you’ve purchased your weed barrier, preparation is an important step. To prepare the area and install the weed barrier, follow these steps:</p> <ul><li>Clear the area of weeds, grass, and other vegetation for the most effective coverage (aside from any plants you intend to keep, of course!).</li><li>If applicable, add any chosen soil amendments (like compost manure or peat moss) to nurture the soil under the barrier—it is less effective to add them after the weed barrier is placed.</li><li>Level the soil with a rake; remove sharp objects, rocks, and roots; and lay down the weed barrier according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</li><li>Use pegs or garden staples every few feet to pin the barrier in place for a sturdy hold, reliable protection, and a more seamless look. Sandbags or rocks are another option.</li><li>Optionally, spread a layer of mulch, rocks, or gravel over the barrier. This decorative layer can improve your garden’s appearance, cut down on UV damage on the barrier, retain soil moisture, and further block weed growth.</li></ul>",389
240,plant mister,"<p>In making our selections for the best plant misters on the market, we considered various factors to suit different needs. First and foremost, a good plant mister must create a fine mist to perform its job. We also considered functionality. While misters that use triggers or pumps to spray are perfectly fine, we leaned toward those that didn’t require the user to repeatedly pull a trigger to get the job done. We also favored versatile misters with adjustable nozzles that allow the user to alter the spray pattern. While function is important, we also considered that many plant enthusiasts prefer to display their sprayer with their plants. With that in mind, we also included misters that could perform their duties and look good doing it.</p>",125
241,plant subscription boxes,"<p>Years of experience covering home and gardening products as well as extensive product research and testing went into creating this guide. We explored more than 30 plant subscription options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <p>Variety: We aimed to include subscriptions that offered a unique selection of houseplants every month without repetition for at least a year.</p> <p>Flexibility: Each plant subscription service has a policy regarding the flexibility of its subscriptions. We prioritized companies that allowed users to pay month-to-month without requiring a long-term commitment as well as brands that offer the option to pause or cancel without incurring a financial penalty.</p> <p>Value: Plant subscriptions vary widely in price, but we aimed to recommend options that are affordable and offer great value based on what is included with each box.</p> <p>Quality: In testing, we examined how well the plant was packed and how it fared in shipping. Upon arrival, we thoroughly inspected it to see if there were pests or any other damage to the plant.</p>",171
242,gardening subscription boxes,"<p>Years of experience covering home and gardening products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 gardening subscription options and weighed a number of practical considerations before choosing our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Variety: We included subscriptions that offer unique seeds or plants every month with no repetition for at least a year.</li><li>Flexibility: Gardening subscriptions vary widely in flexibility. We prioritized options that allow subscribers to pay month to month without requiring a long-term commitment, as well as brands that offer the option to pause or cancel without a penalty.</li><li>Value: Since gardening subscription boxes are available at a wide range of price points, we recommended those that offer excellent value based on the contents of each box.</li></ul>",122
243,wasp traps,"<p>In reviewing dozens of wasp traps for our list, we considered several important criteria, including ease of use, effectiveness, and even aesthetics. A wasp trap should not be difficult to set up or dispose of once full. With that in mind, we only chose traps that one could set up in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>For disposable traps, we chose models that the user could easily remove and place in the trash. All the reusable models we chose included traps that could be opened and emptied without having to directly come into contact with the victims. Wasp traps need to attract wasps, so we only selected traps that incorporated baits that were effective at luring wasps to the trap. Although aesthetics were not paramount, we know that many traps can detract from landscaping. With that in mind, we included some traps with an ornamental look that blends well with landscaping.</p>",150
244,soil for snake plants,"<p>We extensively researched dozens of types of potting soil and grow mix before choosing the top picks in this lineup. For a soil product to make the cut, it had to drain well yet retain enough dampness to give the snake plant’s roots a little moisture in the event the grower misses a watering.</p> <p>In addition, we looked for potting soil that was free from harsh chemicals and that contained most or all-organic ingredients. We looked only at soils that resisted compaction because snake plants don’t like heavy, compacted soil.</p> <p>We didn’t judge the soil as to whether it includes fertilizer, although we noted that it helps get the plants off to a good start. Fertilizer can (and should) be added later, so the exclusion of fertilizer in the mix was not an excluding factor.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Using the Best Soil for Snake Plants</h2> <p>When plants grow in an optimal medium, they thrive, which, for snake plants, means soil that is lightweight, drains well, and contains natural ingredients. Avoid the temptation to fill a pot with dirt from a garden or outdoor raised bed. Snake plants develop the tallest leaf spikes with the richest colors when planted in quality soil. The best soil for snake plants:</p> <ul><li>Drains well, so the roots don’t have “wet feet”</li><li>Remains loose and light to allow roots to develop</li><li>Helps protect the plant even if you forget to water occasionally</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using the Best Soil for Snake Plants</h2> <p>Once the snake plant is in optimal soil, it’s also crucial to use good indoor potting and growing methods to get the plant off to a good start and keep it healthy.</p> <ul><li>Select a pot at least 2 inches in diameter larger than the snake plant’s root ball.</li><li>Create a drainage layer of clean gravel at the bottom of the pot to help keep the drainage holes free from clogs.</li><li>Fill the pot two-thirds of the way with the soil, add the plant, and then fill in around the sides of the root ball with more soil.</li><li>Water from the tap can leave salt deposits in soil that can slow the snake plant’s growth, so consider repotting and refreshing the soil every 3 to 4 years.</li></ul>",366
245,fertilizer for potatoes,"<p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 40 fertilizer options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <p>We aimed to include fertilizers with a high number of nutrients and made sure to feature options with a variety of NPK blends for different times in the growing cycle. We took customer reviews into consideration when making our recommendations, ensuring users had a positive experience with the fertilizer in terms of performance, ease of use, and ultimate yield.</p> <p>Additionally, growing your own vegetables should save money for your household. We aimed to include fertilizers that offered excellent value based on their quality and quantity.</p>",122
246,soil for orchids,"<p>In putting this guide together, we extensively researched dozens of orchid-specific growing mixes—from both well-known garden-product companies and smaller operations—to determine which products were best suited for these tropical plants. The most critical factor in orchid mixes is the ability to drain rapidly, since slow-draining and compacting soil is a death knell for orchids. So, while we also evaluated all-purpose indoor mixes, they didn’t make our final cut because of their tendency to retain too much moisture.</p> <p>To determine the best potting mix for phalaenopsis orchids, we looked for soil that offered some structural stability, such as the inclusion of lava rocks. This helps to provide a firm foundation and keep a lanky stem from dislodging the roots from the soil.</p> <p>We gave special attention to certified organic mixes, but we didn’t exclude quality soils that were not 100 percent organic if they were made from natural ingredients.</p>",148
247,fertilizer for indoor plants,"<p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 40 fertilizer options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Nutrient mix: We aimed to include fertilizers with a variety of micronutrients and macronutrients and feature options with a variety of NPK blends for different types of houseplants.</li><li>Type: Many different kinds of plant fertilizer are on the market, and we tried to showcase the breadth of options available by including both organic and traditional options as well as a variety of formula types.</li><li>Value: Fertilizers vary widely in quantity and concentration, but we considered overall value for the cost when making our recommendations.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using the Best Fertilizer for Indoor Plants</h2> <p>The following tips help ensure your plants thrive without risking overfertilization.</p> <ul><li>Since all fertilizers are different, follow the instructions on the manufacturer’s label.</li><li>Avoid overfertilization—reduce your fertilizing schedule if your plant’s leaves droop or begin to look burnt at the edges.</li><li>Know how to recognize nutritional deficiency based on leaf color: Browning leaves lack potassium, yellow leaves indicate a nitrogen deficiency, and purple leaves often mean the plant lacks phosphorus.</li><li>There’s no need to fertilize most houseplants during their dormant season if you live in an area that experiences standard seasonal temperature changes.</li></ul>",218
248,soil for pothos,"<p>We extensively researched dozens of indoor potting mixes to select some of the best soil choices for pothos. To qualify for consideration, the potting mix had to contain the components necessary for pothos to thrive. Mixes, such as orchid and cactus mix, were excluded, because they drain too rapidly and don’t contain the ingredients required to retain moisture for pothos roots.</p> <p>Mixes that did not contain the ingredients necessary to keep the soil from becoming compressed over time also were excluded. We considered the manufacturer’s reputation—Miracle-Gro is widely recognized as producing high-quality products—but we also looked at lesser-known brands if they contained the right soil components. Our recommendations include a variety of soil options at different price points and quantities to meet the needs of most pothos gardeners.</p>",128
249,soil for strawberries,"<p>We extensively researched dozens of potting soil blends to come up with the products for this lineup. To make the cut, a potting soil product had to drain well, since strawberries don’t like sitting in water, but it also had to retain a bit of moisture between waterings and resist compaction.</p> <p>In addition, we considered the manufacturer’s reputation. While Miracle-Gro, nationally known for producing high-quality gardening products, is highly regarded, we also included some smaller companies that create high-quality premium mixes. We eliminated soil mixes that retained too much or too little moisture. The result is a lineup of top-notch products that can grow flavorful strawberries.</p> <h2>Tips to Prepare Soil for Strawberries</h2> <p>Whether planted in a garden, raised bed, or container, it pays to prepare the soil for growing strawberries in advance and make provisions for drainage.</p> <ul><li>When growing strawberries in a container, place 1 or 2 inches of gravel at the bottom of the pot. Then fill the container with your chosen grow mix.</li><li>Test the soil pH in a garden or raised bed to determine if it’s within the optimal range of 5.5 to 6.8 on the pH scale. If not, follow the amendment recommendations that come with the tester to improve the acid/alkaline balance.</li><li>Add a balanced all-purpose fruit-and-vegetable fertilizer to the soil before planting if not using potting soil that contains nutrients or added fertilizers.</li></ul>",227
250,soil for jade plants,"<p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 20 soil options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <p>Since a fast-draining soil is the primary consideration for jade plants, we made sure every formula we recommended included ingredients to ensure that plants never became waterlogged. When choosing formulas to include in our list, we prioritized those that included natural and organic ingredients.</p> <p>We aimed to feature potting mixtures that contained ingredients to increase drainage and lightly fertilize the plants. Additionally, plant soil is sold in a wide variety of quantities, so we considered overall value for the cost when making our recommendations.</p>",121
251,fertilizer for strawberries,"<p>Strawberries are a popular choice for home gardeners because they’re relatively simple to grow and maintain. Using a fertilizer helps maximize their fruit yield, but choosing the right one can feel overwhelming.</p> <p>Luckily, strawberries are hardy fruits and many fertilizer types will work, which means you can often use the same fertilizer for strawberries as for other plants. This is why we chose a variety of products, from all-purpose fertilizers to those made for growing berries. We selected several different types of fertilizers—including granules, liquids, and powders—to suit different gardeners’ preferences.</p> <p>Through product research, we chose fertilizers with high-quality ingredients and good overall performance. We also took consumer reviews into account to ensure the fertilizers on this list are effective and easy to use.</p>",124
252,fertilizers for cucumbers,"<p>To make the cut for this lineup, the fertilizer first had to provide an NPK analysis that was either balanced or had less nitrogen (N) than phosphorus (P) and potash (K). Any products with a higher nitrogen content were eliminated right away because cucumbers don’t produce well in soil with high nitrogen levels, tending to make all leaves but few, if any, blossoms.</p> <p>We also looked at brand reputation. It’s hard to beat brands like Miracle-Gro based on reliability and quality. However, we didn’t eliminate fertilizer products if they met our guidelines but were manufactured by smaller (or niche) companies. In addition, the fertilizer product had to be well-liked by other consumers who used them and found them beneficial. Plus, the fertilizer had to be simple to use.</p>",128
253,fertilizers for corn,"<p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 20 fertilizer options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Organic vs. inorganic: Since there are advantages to both organic and inorganic fertilizers, we included both types in this guide.</li><li>NPK ratio: Since corn has unique needs in terms of macronutrients, we include both formulas for pre-planting fertilization and side-dressing.</li><li>Value: Plant fertilizers vary widely in type and quantity. We ensured that each recommended product offered excellent value, regardless of the format.</li></ul> <h2>Tips on How to Fertilize Corn</h2> <p>While you may have now chosen the best corn fertilizer for your crop, there are still some important tips when it comes to how to use it. The following pointers should ensure that your corn plants are properly fertilized and that they produce a bountiful harvest.</p> <ul><li>Each fertilizer has specific application instructions; be sure to follow the directions on the label.</li><li>Avoid spraying fertilizer on the corn’s leaves, especially if it contains a high percentage of nitrogen.</li><li>After planting, fertilize corn using a side-dressing technique.</li><li>When using granular fertilizers, ensure they’re thoroughly mixed into the soil.</li><li>Always water the plants when applying fertilizer.</li><li>Stop fertilizing corn when the ears begin to show silk.</li></ul>",211
254,fertilizers for succulents,"<p>Years of experience covering home and garden products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 fertilizer options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Nutrient mix: We prioritized products featuring a mix of key macronutrients and micronutrients. We primarily featured fertilizers with a balanced NPK ratio that are suitable to the widest variety of succulent types.</li><li>Type: Since plant fertilizers come in a variety of formats, we aimed to feature an array of options with varying application methods.</li><li>Value: Fertilizers vary widely in quantity and concentration, so we considered overall value for the cost when choosing our top picks.</li></ul> <h3>Tips on How to Fertilize Succulents</h3> <p>The following tips help ensure that your succulents will thrive without risking overfertilization.</p> <ul><li>Every fertilizer has specific application instructions; be sure to follow the directions listed on the label.</li><li>Research the nutritional needs of your specific plant, and choose a fertilizer with an appropriate NPK ratio.</li><li>Look for signs of overfertilization; drooping and burned leaves may indicate that the plant is being overfertilized.</li><li>Avoid fertilizing succulents during their dormant season, which typically takes place between fall and spring.</li><li>If you have pets, opt for a natural fertilizer, which won’t cause any adverse effects if ingested.</li></ul>",207
255,fertilizer for watermelon,"<p>In making our selections, we relied on our writer’s considerable experience covering gardening products and also conducted extensive research into the science behind fertilizing watermelons. From a variety of fertilizers, we selected both organic and synthetic, granular and liquid, quick release and slow or controlled release. We considered several factors, including the quality of the ingredients, value for the quantity of product, brand reputation, and positive consumer reviews.</p> <h2>Tips for a Watermelon Fertilizer Schedule</h2> <p>Always follow the instructions on the product label for the amount of fertilizer (rate) to apply and how often to apply it. When buying fertilizer, it’s smart to consider the cost per pound. Large containers and fertilizers with more than 30 percent of total available nutrients (such as a 15-15-15) generally are less expensive. For example, a 50-pound bag of 10-20-10 may not cost any more than a 50-pound bag of 5-10-5 fertilizer, but the 10-20-10 bag contains twice the nutrients.</p> <ul><li>Organic fertilizers can be more expensive up front, but because they remain in the soil for long periods (unlike synthetic fertilizers that can wash away through leaching), organic fertilizers can end up being more cost-effective in the long run.</li><li>Mix dry fertilizers into the top 2 to 4 inches of soil; then water it thoroughly. For best results, apply fertilizer in a band along the planting row.</li><li>To give the soil a chance to renew its nutrients and to minimize pest and disease problems, avoid planting watermelons and other cucumber family crops (melons, squash, pumpkins) in the same spot 2 years in a row.</li></ul>",257
256,outdoor faucets,"<p>In reviewing more than two dozen outdoor faucets for this list, we considered a number of criteria. Since outdoor faucets come in a variety of types, we included entries on our list for standard compression outdoor faucets as well as frost-free, anti-siphon, ball valve, spigot, and yard hydrants. Within these categories we looked at durability, limiting our picks to those with brass construction. Since outdoor faucets require periodic maintenance, we also leaned toward models with stems that can be accessed in a few minutes with simple tools. Outdoor faucets should be easy to operate, so we selected models with handles that allow the user to get a firm grip.</p> <h2>Tips on How to Fix a Leaky Outdoor Faucet</h2> <p>Although outdoor faucets are designed to be durable, eventually most will require maintenance to prevent leaks. The good news is, most leaky outdoor faucets are easy to repair. To fix a leaky outdoor faucet, remove the handle and tighten the retaining nut with a pair of pliers. If that doesn’t do the trick, you’ll likely need to replace the washer assembly. Washers are made of soft rubber, which eventually dries out and cracks. To change the washer assembly, remove the stem and remove the screw that holds the assembly together and trade out the washer with a new one. The leak may also be caused by the vacuum breaker at the top of the faucet (if your faucet has one). Pop the cap off the faucet using a flat head screwdriver and inspect the parts. If they’re dirty, clean them off and reassemble the breaker. If damaged, replace the parts.</p> <ul><li>Tighten the retaining nut with a screwdriver.</li><li>Replace the washer assembly on the stem.</li><li>Clean or repair the vacuum breaker on the faucet.</li></ul>",289
257,weed killers for gravel,"<p>Gravel is a common material for creating rustic walks and driveways, but it’s not impermeable, so weeds can blow in and sprout or spread inward from the sides of the area. It’s common to put a weed barrier, such as a plastic liner, between the soil and the gravel, but weeds can still get a foothold over time.</p> <p>Gravel walks look terrific when clean and weed-free, but even a few weeds can ruin their good appearance. We researched dozens of weed killer products to determine which were well suited for use in gravel beds or sanded areas. We considered brand reputation, with Roundup and Ortho products having earned a reputation for efficiency, but didn’t automatically eliminate products made by smaller companies if they performed well.</p> <p>Chemical herbicides are the most effective, but some users are willing to spray more often with a natural weed killer to avoid ingredients that can remain in the ground for up to a year. The products that made the final cut in our lineup are effective and user-friendly.</p>",173
258,fertilizers for zoysia grass,"<p>Lawn fertilizer products are straightforward, and most contain high nitrogen levels, which is the most critical nutrient for greening up a lawn and boosting growth. We looked extensively at dozens of lawn fertilizer products before selecting the ones in this lineup as being among the best for zoysia grass.</p> <p>In general, most lawn fertilizers will be good bets for applying to zoysia grass because zoysia has the same nutritional needs as other turfgrasses. We looked at nationally known companies with stellar reputations for making quality lawn and garden products, such as Miracle-Gro and Scotts. Still, we didn’t automatically eliminate fertilizers from smaller or niche manufacturers if they contained quality ingredients.</p> <p>Finally, we looked at how satisfied customers were with different lawn fertilizer products. In the final analysis, we considered products containing additional ingredients, although our focus was still on ensuring that the product had adequate nitrogen.</p>",146
259,liquid lawn fertilizers,"<p>We researched dozens of lawn fertilizers before deciding on the products for this lineup. To qualify, the fertilizers had to contain the nutrients necessary for healthy grass growth. They had to contain nitrogen, the top nutrient choice for beautiful lawns. Depending on the stated purpose of the fertilizer, however, it could also include additional nutrients designed to treat specific types of nutrient depletion in soil or boost new seed germination.</p> <p>While we considered the brand—Scotts is a well known and highly respected manufacturer of lawn products—we didn’t automatically eliminate products from smaller or niche manufacturers as long as they contained the ingredients lawns need.</p> <p>The products we selected are made for various lawn situations, but will boost grass health and improve lawn color.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Liquid Lawn Fertilizers </h2> <p>Both liquid and granular lawn fertilizers can supply the grass with the nutrients needed to grow healthy and strong, but liquid fertilizers offer some specific benefits.</p> <ul><li>The best liquid fertilizer is absorbed quickly, and benefits can be seen in 2 to 4 days.</li><li>Diluting liquid fertilizer is often less complicated than calibrating a drop or broadcast spreader, making the application of liquid lawn fertilizers more user-friendly.</li><li>Liquid fertilizers can often be applied during periods of light rain or drizzle, so there’s no waiting to feed the lawn.</li><li>The best liquid lawn fertilizer concentrate can be diluted to cover a large lawn area.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using Liquid Lawn Fertilizers </h2> <p>Applying liquid lawn fertilizer is usually straightforward; a few tips can make it even simpler and enhance the results.</p> <ul><li>Use a liquid hose-end sprayer if possible. While using a pump-type garden sprayer is possible, users will have the extra work of stopping to pump up the pressure in the sprayer and adding more solution each time they run out. With a hose-end applicator, all that’s necessary is to attach the sprayer to the end of the garden hose. The solution is automatically diluted while being sprayed.</li><li>Walk backwards when using a spray fertilizer. It’s the simplest way to apply the solution uniformly—plus, you won’t be walking through grass that’s already been saturated with fertilizer.</li><li>Consider marking out lawn areas with stakes to help you track where you’ve already fertilized. By creating workable areas, say 15 feet wide, it’s easy to apply the fertilizer spray uniformly. Using flags or stakes to mark the areas can help.</li></ul>",387
260,weed killers for bermuda grass,"<p>In choosing the best weed killers for Bermuda grass lawns, we focused on ingredients that are known to kill a variety of weeds, such as 2,4-D, while leaving Bermuda grass unharmed.</p> <p>We also looked at products that prevent weed seeds from sprouting, known as pre-emergent herbicides. These products form a barrier on the surface of the soil that lasts anywhere from 2 to 4 months. The downside is that while pre-emergents stop weed seeds from germinating, they also prevent beneficial seeds from germinating, so they should not be used before reseeding a lawn.</p> <p>When choosing the products, we placed a lot of value on reputable brands, such as Ortho. Still, we didn’t automatically exclude smaller or niche brands if they contained ingredients known to be effective and if former buyers had good experiences with them.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Weed Killers for Bermuda Grass</h2> <p>Treat the lawn with a selective weed killer at the first sign of weeds. When caught early, weeds don’t have time to spread, so they’ll do less damage to the lawn. In addition:</p> <ul><li>Choose a product such as 2,4-D that won’t damage Bermuda grass.</li><li>Consider applying a pre-emergent before common weeds, such as dandelions, go to seed in your region.</li><li>If you spot one or two rogue weeds that escaped the weed killer, spray them individually with a ready-to-use selective weed killer safe for use on Bermuda grass.</li></ul>",229
261,hori hori knives,"<p>The best hori hori knives are practical, durable, and comfortable to use. We kept these three criteria top of mind when choosing the top picks for our list. We considered more than 15 models and made our top picks based on extensive product research.</p> <p>All of the knives on this list feature a straight edge and a serrated edge for better versatility. We prioritized knives made from high-quality materials, including sturdy stainless steel with wood or bamboo handles. We did include a few knives with decent plastic handles; these were affordable picks. A hori hori knife earned more points for a full-tang blade, which will hold up better through tough gardening tasks.</p> <p>While material is important, it’s not the only factor that affects use. We also looked for balanced and ergonomic designs, so the knives feel comfortable in hand.</p>",139
262,vole repellents,"<p>Years of experience covering home goods and gardening supplies as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 35 vole deterrent options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Type: There are several different types of vole repellents on the market, and we aimed to include options of each variety to appeal to the widest array of shoppers.</li><li>Reviews: Many vole deterrents make impressive claims but don’t actually hold up to user testing, so we included only well-reviewed products on this list.</li><li>Safety: When choosing a vole repellent, opt for a product that’s humane and won’t cause harm to pets or neighborhood animals. We chose only humane and nontoxic repellents for this guide.</li></ul>",121
263,fertilizers for apple trees,"<p>We conducted extensive research into dozens of today’s best-selling brands of fruit-tree fertilizers when considering the top picks for this list. We looked closely at national brands with stellar reputations, such as Jobe’s and Miracle-Gro. Still, we didn’t automatically eliminate smaller or niche brands if their products contained the nutrients known to boost apple tree health.</p> <p>We looked at both synthetic and natural formulations, and we considered price as well as buyer satisfaction.</p> <p>To make our final cut, the products also had to be straightforward and relatively easy to apply. We allowed for some measuring and mixing, but we didn’t select products that required calculating complex formulas or those unsuited to both young and mature apple trees.</p> <h2>Tips for When to Fertilize Apple Trees</h2> <p>It’s a rare soil that naturally provides all the nutrients an apple tree needs to produce a bountiful harvest. Knowing when to fertilize fruit trees is key. The following tips can help.</p> <ul><li>Fertilize an apple tree right after transplanting it to help it develop a robust root system.</li><li>Fertilize young apple trees that have not yet reached their mature height in the spring and again in the fall after the leaves have dropped.</li><li>Mature apple trees only need one feeding per year, in spring.</li></ul>",206
264,seed starting trays,"<p>Years of experience covering home improvement and gardening as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide on the best seed starting trays. We explored more than 25 seed tray options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Material: Both plastic and biodegradable seed trays have their own advantages, so we opted to include examples of both among our recommendations.</li><li>Capacity: Seed starting trays vary widely when it comes to their capacity. We included both large and small trays in our top picks in order to provide options for most home gardeners.</li><li>Cell size: Cell sizes on seed starting trays vary, but we opted to exclude any trays with depths of more than 3 inches because they tend to drain poorly.</li></ul> <h2>Advantages of Using Seed Starting Trays</h2> <p>While it’s possible to germinate seeds in nearly any kind of container, using a seed starting tray makes the process simpler, tidier, and easier to maintain. Here are some advantages of using a seed starting tray.</p> <ul><li>Seed trays line up the seedlings in rows, making them easier to heat or water evenly.</li><li>Seed trays are easy to move around and can be brought outdoors once the weather is favorable.</li><li>Seed trays feature drainage holes, which allow the soil or seed starting mix to drain effectively.</li></ul>",214
265,solar path lights,"<p>Solar lights don’t come with many functions, but consumers want to know that they’re getting well-made lights that won’t rust or die after a rain shower. We tested each set of lights and noted their intensity, how long their batteries lasted, and whether they were made from durable materials.</p> <p>We awarded points for real glass and metal components, but we also included well-made plastic models because they’re more affordable and offer similar illumination. We noticed that the more lumens the light produced, typically the shorter they remained alight at night. The exception to this rule was the Aityvert torches that stayed on until the sun rose.</p> <p>The solar lights were also awarded points for providing something extra, such as creating exciting light patterns on the ground or featuring color-changing LED bulbs.</p>",131
266,lawn fertilizer,"<p>The lawn fertilizer industry is flush with specialty products for every conceivable need. Unique formulations abound for winterization, spring green-up, summer maintenance, weed and feed, lawn starter, northern and southern grass formulas, and so much more. We wanted to cut through the noise and recommend lawn foods that would be broadly useful for the widest range of lawns, including warm and cool-season grasses and acid-loving lawns.</p> <p>Effective fertilizers provide for the ongoing needs of the targeted plant. For most lawn grasses, without considering the existing soil chemistry, an NPK ratio of about 4-1-2 is necessary for healthy growth. However, since most soils in North America hold an adequate amount of P, we decided to start our search with 4-0-2 equivalent fertilizers (8-0-4, 12-0-6, etc). This was not an absolute, but more of a guide.</p> <p>As for formulations, we leaned into organic and natural products for a couple of reasons. Organic fertilizers are non-burning, promote healthy soil ecology, minimize nutrient runoff, and provide an extended, steady feed. Non-organic fertilizers can do these things as well, but as a category, organics do so with a high level of consistency from product to product. Plus, it’s rare that a lawn actually needs a quick burst of plant food, even more so with lawns that have been consistently fed.</p> <p>Our final list included organic selections for regular maintenance and repair, along with non-organics for unique situations where their targeted use solves specific problems.</p> <h2>Tips for How to Fertilize Your Lawn</h2> <p>The first and most important step in fertilizing the lawn is to find out what the lawn is lacking. By testing the soil chemistry, you quickly uncover nutrient imbalances that can be corrected with targeted applications. Otherwise, you risk overapplying nutrients that are already present or neglecting a nutrient deficiency. Once you have the test results in hand, then match the results to the best available fertilizer.</p> <ul><li>For even coverage, apply with a fertilizer spreader.</li><li>With the spreader calibrated at half the recommended rate, apply in parallel lines going one direction, then again in lines running perpendicular to the first application.</li><li>Avoid broadcasting fertilizer onto pavement or landscape beds.</li><li>Blow or sweep fertilizer off of pavement immediately after application.</li><li>Apply fertilizer ahead of rain or run sprinklers within 24 hours after application.</li></ul>",374
267,greenhouse heaters,"<p>When considering the best heater for greenhouse use, we chose greenhouse heaters suitable for compact greenhouses—the types typically owned by home gardeners. Very large greenhouses and commercial greenhouses may have different needs. To suit different gardeners, we chose a few different heater types, from propane greenhouse heaters for small greenhouses to larger ceiling-mounted units.</p> <p>The heaters in this lineup are suitable for different-size backyard greenhouses and were selected with hobbyists in mind. They are easy to set up and use, energy efficient, and low maintenance.</p> <p>Robust safety features earned several heaters a spot in our roundup. We prioritized heaters that gardeners will feel safe to leave in the greenhouse while they’re not on the premises.</p> <h2>Tips for Keeping a Greenhouse Warm</h2> <p>Using a greenhouse heater isn’t the only way to keep a greenhouse warm. Thoughtful gardeners can conserve heat naturally with the practices described below, and even in cold climates where a heater is necessary, these tips can lower the amount of additional heat needed.</p> <p>Insulation can do a great deal in helping a greenhouse trap heat. Some air circulation is necessary in a greenhouse, but make sure to seal unnecessary air leaks. One popular and inexpensive way to add extra insulation to a greenhouse is with Bubble Wrap. Installed across greenhouse walls and ceilings, its small air bubbles help keep heat in the building.</p> <p>A heat-retaining thermal mass can also help the greenhouse maintain a higher temperature. Large barrels filled with water are a commonly used, cost-effective option. The sun heats the water throughout the day and some of that warmth is retained after the sun goes down. Heat sinks made of cinder blocks, stone, bricks, and cement are other options. A well-tended compost pile can also generate a good amount of heat, so consider moving the compost pile into the greenhouse through winter.</p> <p>If these methods cannot create and maintain the desired temperature, a greenhouse heater is a reliable option for gardeners.</p> <ul><li>Insulate the greenhouse by sealing air leaks and using Bubble Wrap to line the walls and ceiling.</li><li>Add a thermal mass to retain heat from the sun.</li><li>Utilize a greenhouse heater as needed.</li></ul>",355
268,outdoor furniture cover,"<p>Covers for outdoor furniture are a worthwhile investment to protect your outdoor patio set. To determine the best, we focused on furniture covers that are available in various sizes, offer the best in UV protection and water resistance, include easy-to-use straps, and have additional features such as reinforced seams or padded handles.</p> <p>These recommendations for the best outdoor furniture covers include options that are for furniture of various shapes and sizes, as well as for grills and furniture cushions. Our picks for the best outdoor furniture covers will help protect your hardwood table, wrought-iron chairs, brightly colored cushions, and wicker dining set by safeguarding and preserving their brand-new appearance for years to come.</p> <h2>Tips for Maintaining Outdoor Furniture</h2> <p>The best patio furniture covers do most of the work when it comes to protection—but there are additional measures that enhance their performance, and ones you can take for when the patio set <i>isn’t</i> covered. Refer to the tips below on how to maintain outdoor furniture, both covered and uncovered.</p> <h3><b>Rain Protection</b></h3> <ul><li>When it rains and you forget to put covers on, or simply don’t use them, make sure to wipe down wood and wrought iron furniture afterward.</li><li>If you live in a sunny climate and prefer not to use furniture covers, treat wood, wrought iron, and colored fabric with a UV protection spray.</li><li>Waterproof sprays are also available for outdoor furniture pieces and fabric; however, covers are a more effective, long-lasting option for areas with frequent rainfall.</li></ul> <h3>Seasonal Storage</h3> <ul><li>Clean patio furniture before storing it long-term, and use a light-duty cover to prevent dust build-up.</li><li>When storing furniture in a garage or shed for the winter, and this season involves freezing temperatures, turn each item upside down; this will remove any leftover water, which can damage furniture upon freezing.</li><li>If you opt for a tarp rather than a designated cover, elevate chair and table legs to allow for air circulation.</li></ul> <h3>Routine Cleaning</h3> <ul><li>Wipe furniture and cushions with a cloth or use a scrub brush, paired with mild dish detergent and water.</li><li>Before cleaning outdoor cushions, dust them off to remove pollen, dirt, or other debris on the surface.</li><li>Use a remover specifically formulated for stains or mold and mildew when handling these issues, and make sure the product is compatible with the furniture material or cushion fabric.</li></ul> <h3>Appearance</h3> <ul><li>Apply dedicated wood oil or varnish to protect furniture finishes and restore color.</li><li>Use car wax to maintain plastic or aluminum furniture, and dedicated wax for wicker pieces.</li><li>Treat wrought iron furniture with a rust-inhibiting spray, which also acts as a sealant.</li><li>Use an outdoor paint spray or apply with a brush to refresh wrought iron and wicker furniture.</li></ul>",437
269,patio chairs,"<p>The right patio chairs can aid in relaxation during a day in the sun and double as indoor furniture. The top picks above highlight some of the best features available if you’re set on finding new furniture for your patio.</p> <p>Many of the featured chairs are made with sturdy steel frames to remain functionable and tarnish-free, in addition to supporting an average of 250lbs. Our top picks also go above and beyond in durability by being waterproof and UV-resistant for use during the summer months. Some of these sets also come with cushions and accompanying tables, saving you the need to shop for accompanying furniture pieces.</p> <p>Need more luxury? Many of our top picks come with the versatility of cup holders, device holders, headrests, and foldability for easy storage and transport. Finally, some of the recommended picks are reclinable, offering extra back support and relaxation for time spent outdoors.</p>",149
270,outdoor sectionals,"<p>A good outdoor sectional is comfortable, practical, and durable. We considered more than 30 sectionals when narrowing down this list. To suit a range of different households, we chose outdoor sectionals in various sizes and styles and at different price points. Since the main attraction of a sectional is its modular design, we also chose several types of layouts (including a few flexible modular options) to fit differently sized patios and porches.</p> <p>We looked for durable materials that are easy to clean and maintain. Through extensive product research and consideration of online reviews, we also prioritized comfort by choosing cozy sectionals for hosting and relaxing. Lastly, an outdoor sectional is often a statement piece, so we chose stylish pieces that fit a range of decor aesthetics.</p>",126
271,outdoor bar stools,"<p>There are several features to consider when choosing an outdoor bar stool, and with so many options available, picking the right one can feel overwhelming. Like any other furniture piece, shoppers want a stylish option, so we kept aesthetics in mind when choosing the best outdoor bar stools. An attractive bar stool doesn’t need to come at a high cost, so we made sure to choose several affordable options.</p> <p>Durability is top of mind, especially when choosing outdoor furniture. A good bar stool should last several years, so we made sure our top picks were durable. Through extensive product research, we chose outdoor bar stools made of sturdy materials, made to withstand water and sun exposure, season after season.</p> <p>Lastly, what good is a bar stool if it’s uncomfortable to sit in? Comfort was our last major criteria point. While we did choose a couple of simple bar stools, we mainly stuck to bar stools with extra comfort features, like backrests, armrests, cushions, and swivel bases.</p>",166
272,cat repellents,"<p>Years of experience covering home goods as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 cat deterrent options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Type: Many types of cat repellents, all of which have different uses, are available. To make this guide as comprehensive as possible, we included products designed for both indoor and outdoor use as well as products that purport to correct a variety of behaviors.</li><li>Reviews: Many cat deterrents make impressive claims but don’t actually hold up to user testing, so we included only well-reviewed products on this list, regardless of format.</li><li>Safety: When choosing a cat repellent, opt for a product that’s humane that won’t cause harm to pets or neighborhood animals. We chose only nontoxic and safe repellents in this guide.</li></ul>",136
273,storage shed,"<p>We reviewed dozens of the best storage sheds on the market. In our research, we evaluated certain criteria that helped inform our top picks.</p> <p>In our product review, we assessed:</p> <ul><li>Quality craftsmanship: Each of our recommendations is built to last (providing the climate is suitable for the material). We typically selected products with anchoring solutions built into the design with high-quality materials and construction, security features such as locking doors and windows, and more.</li><li>Design: Even small storage sheds take up a fair amount of space. We also looked for aesthetically pleasing designs.</li><li>Brand reputation: We selected storage sheds from companies known for their quality, experience, and customer rapport. We recommend products from brands with a stellar reputation.</li><li>Ease of assembly: We erred on the side of selecting products that are straightforward for a seasoned DIYer to put together.</li></ul>",136
274,hedge trimmer,"<p>We researched the best hedge trimmers in a variety of categories and chose models with high customer satisfaction. The top picks include corded electric, cordless electric, and gas-powered tools to suit different preferences and job types. The list factors in cutting capacity, blade size, weight, battery life, and special features offered by the top brands.</p> <p>The chosen hedge trimmers cut branches ranging from ⅜ to 1 inch in diameter with blade sizes between 18 to 24 inches. We prioritized relatively lightweight tools with runtimes over 40 minutes for cordless electric and gas tools. Some models come with a battery and a charger included to get you started with landscaping right away. Additionally, the list prioritized models with features such as dual-action blades, a comfortable grip, and anti-vibration systems.</p>",128
275,mulching blades,"<p>We researched the most sought-after options in their respective categories and discovered that the best mulching blades are determined by their size, weight, mounting type, compatibility with multiple mowers, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>Our top picks range from 21-inch to 54-inch blades with varying thicknesses to tackle small or large outdoor projects and work with multiple mulching lawn mowers available. While some have thin constructions that are meant for grass clippings and leaves, others are made thick to withstand collisions with stumps or rocks and have powder-coated steel finishes for long lifespans. This also coincides with the weight of each mulching blade as some are lightweight for small jobs or mowers while the heavier options are suitable for mowers that come with ample torque.</p> <p>From universal, bow-tie, five-star, and six-star mounting holes, many of the above picks have serrated teeth and high lift for leaves or dry to wet grass clippings, making them compatible with baggers. Finally, select picks come with multiple blades included to keep your grass and lawn in good shape for years to come.</p>",181
276,self propelled lawn mower,"<p>The best self-propelled mowers are innovative machines that can be either front- or rear-wheel drive, propelling the lawn mower while the user simply directs the mower where to go. Our list of recommendations includes a range of choices for users depending on their preference—from lightweight battery units that are easy to maneuver, to power-house gas units that can cut through almost anything.</p> <p>Our top picks of self-propelled lawn mowers can match the pace of the user to avoid the constant starting and stopping that creates uneven patches in the lawn. We made sure to look at speed control in our research, to provide options for shoppers looking for a mower that can match their individual pace instead of feeling like the machine is running away from them.</p> <p>Several of our options also feature adjustable cutting heights and innovative battery and charger units, which can handle large yards without needing to stop halfway through to recharge.</p>",155
277,hose reel,"<p>You’re meticulous about your lawn and garden, and all is in its place. That’s why you need a sturdy and reliable hose reel that can hold the length of your hose neatly and does not break down over time.</p> <p>Many of the above options are made with aluminum or steel construction with powder-coated finishes for a long-lasting, waterproof lifespan. While some of the options are best kept in the garage over the winter, each of our top picks is able to hold over 100 feet of hose length with the added benefit of hose leads and guides for no tangles or warping.</p> <p>Some of the above options are meant to be portable by including wheeled frames, while others have hand cranks or automatic retraction for easy cleanup after your yard work. For added features, some of the top picks also include storage racks and trays as well as spray nozzles for convenience.</p> <p>Note that not all of these models are safe for year-round use, and some may require additional mounting or assembly before use.</p>",174
278,zero turn mower,"<p>For the purpose of selecting the top zero turn mowers, it was necessary to conduct extensive research into each product to determine the positive and negative aspects, along with any outstanding features that a mower may have. Due to the complexity of these machines, there were several important factors to consider when deciding on the best zero turn mower in each category, including the size of the cutting deck, mower speed, weight, fuel capacity, runtime, and power source.</p> <p>With so many product specifications to consider, it was essential to have separate categories for top performers in both the gas-powered and electric groups. Similarly, the weight, fuel capacity, and runtime helped separate products that were best for small yards from those that were more suitable for larger yards. Some thought was also given to extra features, like built-in headlights and cup holders, though these only improved the standing of a product if the primary features were similar to competitors.</p>",158
279,metal detector,"<p>We researched the best metal detectors in a variety of categories and chose options with high customer satisfaction. The list factors in the type of metal detector, weight, maximum search depth, operating modes, special features, and accessories included by the top brands.</p> <p>VLF and waterproof metal detectors were among the most popular options and the list focuses on these types with one PI detector included. We focused on lightweight units that are easy to handle, weighing between 6.3 ounces and 6.84 pounds. The chosen metal detectors have maximum search depths between 3 to 8.7 inches and target a variety of metals. The list prioritizes models with all-metal and discrimination modes, frequency and sensitivity adjustment, and target depth indicators. We also chose metal detectors that come with accessories such as headphones and a shovel.</p>",133
280,compost tumbler,"<p>Keeping a compost tumbler in your backyard, on your patio, or in your shed can help to eliminate waste from your home and landfills. Each of the above options comes with varying sizes and constructions for different household and garden sizes, while many also come with aeration holes, deep fins, handles for turning, and/or rotation locks for safety and convenience.</p> <p>For different preferences and required capacities, the above picks include ground-rolling, central axis, or hand-crankable options with capacities between 19 and 47 gallons. Many of these options are made with BPA-free, UV-resistant materials or galvanized steel construction to ensure pest-free capability and durability.</p> <p>Finally, many of the above top picks are made with dual-chamber functionality for convenience and double sliding doors for ample compost treatment. However, do note that some of these options require assembly before use.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Compost Tumbler</h2> <p>Composting at home reduces landfill waste. It also eliminates the need for a truck to drive around picking up materials for off-site composting. Plus, you get to use your own compost to promote a healthy garden, landscape, and houseplants. It also helps avoid the traditional downsides of composting: the amount of work involved, the mess and odors associated with it, the fear of attracting animal pests, and more. Compost tumblers eliminate these objections.</p> <ul><li>Compost tumblers fully enclose the composting process, eliminating the mess and attraction to animals.</li><li>Tumblers make it much easier and faster to aerate the compost, eliminating odors and reducing processing time by as much as 50 to 70 percent compared to a compost pile.</li><li>The tumblers can process smaller quantities of waste more efficiently than can compost piles.</li></ul>",273
281,smoker,"<p>For the master griller or the beginner, the right smoker can make all the difference when cooking ribs, pork shoulder, or brisket. We researched the most sought-after smokers in their respective categories and discovered that pellet, charcoal, vertical, electric, and offset models are favored for their large cooking surfaces, portability, and special features.</p> <p>The above list includes effective smokers with 30 to 1,890 square inches of cooking space and heavy-gauge and porcelain-enameled constructions for ampe cooking and long lifespans. Most of these options also come with built-in wheels, temperature gauges, and durable racks for cooking. For the charcoal and pellet models, many brands include removable ash pans or fireboxes for easy post-use cleanup, or convection fan systems for ventilation.</p> <p>Smoker grill combos are also included in the above list as they can smoke, grill, bake, roast, braise, and barbecue. While select models come with sturdy feet, most of the above picks come with built-in wheels for portability. For added convenience, some brands also include adjustable racks, digital control boards, or even Bluetooth connectivity.</p>",173
282,electric fence charger,"<p>The size of the area that needs to be properly electrified is a primary factor for choosing the best electric fence charger. To accommodate a range of needs, we included a number of products that can cover 2 to 50 miles, which helps livestock owners and pet owners alike. The amount of power or joules that the electric fence charger puts out is also important, since a low-power unit won’t affect a horse or a bear. Our list has several units that have low output and several with powerful output to keep any wandering creatures in or out as needed.</p> <p>We narrowed our research to also include standard electrical chargers and some solar chargers. In regions with plenty of sun, solar electric fence chargers are cost-effective, and they include a battery to operate for several cloudy days. It’s also a helpful method for remote areas without electricity. Finally, we chose several units that work with any type of electric fencing and some that work best with steel as opposed to poly wires.</p>",172
283,gas chainsaw,"<p>These recommendations for the best gas chainsaw span a variety of sizes to suit the range of needs of the average user, whether those needs include pruning a few trees or felling a number of trees on a wooded property.</p> <p>We narrowed our research to focus primarily on chainsaws with two-stroke engines—some of the most popular options on the market because of their size and weight, maneuverability, and versatility to tackle light-duty or general tasks, depending on the motor’s power output.</p> <p>Our favorite models feature bars spanning anywhere from 12 to 24 inches in length to accommodate a range of tree diameters. While not all two-stroke gas engines meet environmental standards, the team prioritized models with compliance to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and (California Air Resources Board) CARB emission standards.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, a number of the most reliable chainsaw makers were on our radar. Always remember that the right gas chainsaw for you will depend on what you’re using it for.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Gas Chainsaw</h2> <p>Electric chainsaws remain a viable choice for small urban gardens, particularly in areas with noise restrictions. Additionally, while small chainsaws do a good job pruning small trees, they can’t stand up to everyday wood cutting.</p> <p>Gas chainsaws make the best choice to deal with sizable tree limbs, woodland or forestry management, or even a large log pile. Professionals favor them because they offer:</p> <ul><li>Unrestricted movement: With a tank of gas and a can of oil, the user can go anywhere. There’s no power cord to worry about and no need to charge batteries.</li><li>Unrivaled performance: Gas powered chainsaws invariably outperform electric chainsaws when it comes to power.</li><li>Durability: Although difficult to generalize, a properly-maintained, high-quality gas chainsaw usually outlasts a battery-operated chainsaw.</li></ul>",288
284,gas string trimmer,"<p>The recommendations for the best gas string trimmers include a variety of engine types to suit many typical users who want to tidy landscaping around a home. We narrowed the field of research to include tools that deliver both the required power needed for home use and the ease of string changing, as well as options that have straight and curved shafts. While weight can be a factor for some users, there are tools on this list that range from 13 to 21 pounds.</p> <p>We also evaluated the trimmers based on their cutting width, fuel efficiency, speed, ease of use, safety features, and attachments. Some of the tools on this list include extras like safety equipment or attachments beyond the basic tool. Others that ranked high in our research are able to work with multiple attachments and even other brands’ accessories (sold separately), increasing the flexibility of the tool’s uses.</p>",150
285,lightweight garden hose,"<p>We researched the most sought-after lightweight garden hoses in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their weight, materials, length, ease of use, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the most popular lightweight garden hoses available, the most popular types among users were the expandable, coiled, soaker, and flat models for their ease of use and durable materials. Each of these lightweight hoses was made to last with brass, PVC, vinyl, latex, rubber, and fabric constructions, most of which range from 25 to 150 feet in length and weights of under 4 pounds.</p> <p>As for user-friendliness, select options come with multi-position spray heads, built-in shut-off valves, and protective covers. Select options are also safe to use for drinking water.</p>",129
286,watering wand,"<p>The best watering wand is functional, sturdy, and can include a range of adjustable features to make it easier to water lawns and gardens. We looked at whether a wand has adjustable spray patterns and curved, adjustable, or pivoting heads so that it can meet multiple lawn and garden needs. We also looked at the wand’s materials; metal is the most durable material, but it’s heavier than plastic.</p> <p>Wand weight and shaft length matter for those who are prone to arm, hand, or wrist fatigue. Shorter wands typically weigh less and work best in small spaces where a longer 30-inch wand gets in the way. But a longer wand helps when gardeners have to reach under or behind plants. Handle design and the control lever also are important features for durability, ease of use, and ergonomics.</p>",136
287,cordless lawn mower,"<p>Two key factors in choosing the best cordless lawn mowers are the amount of runtime and motor power the unit has. The recommendations we selected have great runtimes overall for average lawns, and most of them come with two batteries for extra power or extra runtime.</p> <p>While most lawn mowers have a standard 21-inch cutting deck, we also included a model with a smaller 14-inch deck that works well for smaller yards or yards with lots of trees and landscaping to navigate. All the mowers in our list also include height-adjusting levers.</p> <p>Since none of them are oil or gas lawn mowers, there are no fumes to worry about—only battery-charging time. Some mowers take longer than others to recharge, which may not be a problem for average-size yards. Our recommendations also include self-propelled and traditional push mowers from some of the most popular brands on the market.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Cordless Lawn Mower </h2> <p>One of the best ways to get the most out of a cordless lawn mower is to invest in some extra power. Whether a lawn mower uses one, two, or three batteries, having some extra batteries charging can turn a user into a nonstop lawn-mowing machine. For those with large lawns, shoppers may also want to consider an extra charger or a multi-battery model.</p> <p>For users who already have a cordless power tool lineup, it makes sense to look for a lawn mower from the same brand. Very often, the batteries will be interchangeable between tools, allowing users to swap in a high amp-hour battery from a lawn mower for use in a tool such as a weed whacker or a reciprocating saw, getting two or three times the amount of runtime.</p> <p>Another benefit of cordless lawn mowers is they don’t contain oil and gasoline reservoirs, which can make them much handier to store in a shed. In fact, since these mowers don’t contain any liquids, they can be stored vertically if the handles fold.</p> <ul><li>Make sure you store battery-powered lawn mowers in a ventilated, dry place after mowing season, as any moisture could result in problems with the battery.</li><li>Frequent cleaning will ensure that battery-powered lawn mowers will run correctly, as dust and debris can get into the inner workings of the mower.</li><li>Ensure there are no rocks or hard objects on your lawn before mowing to ensure you don’t damage the blades and motor.</li></ul>",398
288,gas lawn mower,"<p>We researched some of the best-selling gas lawn mowers from such major retailers as The Home Depot, Amazon, and Tractor Supply Co. in order to produce our list of the top gas-powered lawn mowers. Our research focused on three major attributes: deck size, engine size, and cutting functions. Gas lawn mowers are a rather broad classification, so we broke the mowers down into smaller, manual push-behind models suitable for smaller yards; self-propelled lawn mowers for medium-size yards; and riding lawn mowers for large yards in order to get a suitable comparison.</p> <p>Engine size was crucial to our selection process. While a 125 cc engine is capable of powering a gas mower, mowers with these smaller engines can struggle to power broader cutting decks through thicker grass. The best gas lawn mowers have engines large enough to power their respective mowing decks. We selected mowers with at least 140 cc engines for mowers with 21-inch decks. Having the options to mulch and bag are also crucial. When possible, we leaned toward models that offer at least two out of the three cutting options (side discharge, mulching, bagging).</p> <p>Our rankings also took into account the reputation of the brand. We selected well-regarded brands that have been in the business for decades such as Toro, Honda, and Cub Cadet. All of the brands represented on our list have well-established reputations for producing quality gas lawn mowers.</p>",233
289,lawn mowers,"<p>All of the mowers included in our list exceeded quality standards established in our shopping criteria and proved worthy through testing. We selected each of the above mowers based on our previously mentioned shopping considerations. After sourcing the mowers and assembling the mowers according to the manufacturer’s instructions, we tested them in an average yard in order to gauge capabilities in several key areas. The most critical aspects we observed included general quality and durability, mowing power and cut quality, and operator comfort and convenience.</p> <p>We also tested each according to its claimed abilities. Riding mowers were used for larger and sometimes rougher areas and were assessed for power, speed, and comfort. Walk-behind and push mowers were mostly restricted to testing on well-established and well-maintained lawn spaces and closely monitored for cut quality and user convenience. We actually pre-mowed the grass ahead of testing the robot mower since it is intended to maintain rather than reduce grass height.</p>",158
290,mulching lawn mowers,"<p>We researched some two dozen lawn mowers with mulching capabilities to produce our list that shows the best mulching lawn mower for each of several categories. Since mulching requires more power than standard cutting, we selected mowers with ample power. For gas lawn mowers, we selected models with at least a 140-cc engine. For battery-powered models, we chose models with at least a 40-volt battery.</p> <p>Since deck and blade design is also important, we selected mowers explicitly designed to produce the fine grass clippings needed to effectively provide nutrients to a lawn. These included mowers with technologies designed specifically for mulching, including multiple blades, special venting, or integrated rakes. Since most owners don’t mulch their lawn with every cutting, we also chose mowers that offer versatility with side-discharge and bagging cutting options.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Mulching Lawn Mower</h2> <p>You can do a few things to get the most out of your mower’s mulch settings. First and foremost, mow at the proper height. Only cut a third of the height of the grass blade. This will ensure that the clippings are small enough for your mower to mulch them effectively. Mower blades need to cut the clippings multiple times, so keep the mower blade sharp. Also, it’s easier for a lawn mower blade to cut dry grass, so only mulch when the lawn is dry. Finally, if you’re mulching your grass clippings instead of bagging them, you’re returning nutrients to your yard. That means you can use less fertilizer.</p> <ul><li>Only mow a third of the height of your lawn.</li><li>Mow when it’s dry.</li><li>Keep the mower blades sharp.</li><li>Use less fertilizer.</li></ul>",268
291,zero turn mowers for five acres,"<p>Relying on the shopping considerations outlined earlier, we scoured the internet for medium to large zero-turn mowers built with homeowners in mind. We quickly homed in on the right-sized combination of a 60-inch three-blade deck and 24-hp engine. Finally, we settled on six industry-leading brands to choose from, each offering its own nuanced approach to designing and manufacturing zero-turn mowers. These brands also happen to be widely available through nationwide retailers and dealer networks.</p> <p>We included high-quality picks at a variety of price points without sacrificing reliability or durability. The value-priced models in our lineup offer excellent power and performance, but they may not deliver top end comfort or efficiency. Our higher-priced suggestions offer more in terms of comfort, speed, power, or styling. If you are serious about buying a new zero-turn mower, we believe that these recommendations will help narrow your search.</p>",143
292,commercial zero turn mowers,"<p>Our first intention was to show what makes commercial zero-turn mowers different from, and significantly more expensive than, their residential counterparts. Then we wanted to provide a list of top models that both large-acreage homeowners and business owners would find helpful. To illustrate the full spectrum, we included a few top-end residential machines and highlighted the best true commercial mowers available.</p> <p>We sourced these picks by consulting with commercial and residential landscapers, social media groups, and Google rankings. After compiling a starting list of 46 mower models, we lumped together models from the same brand and series to develop our final listing. Then we compared the manufacturer specifications for each series and/or model to determine the award winners.</p> <h2>Safety and Maintenance Tips for Commercial Zero-Turn Mowers </h2> <p>A commercial zero-turn mower can upgrade your yard-maintenance program. It will do the job much more quickly than either a riding mower or residential-grade zero-turn mower, possibly save on fuel costs, and produce a higher-quality finish. The increased power and precision will set you back as much as twice the price of standard homeowner equipment, but with regular maintenance, you should expect a satisfactory return on that investment. Protect yourself and your equipment by following these safety and maintenance guidelines:</p> <ul><li>Protect yourself from flying debris by wearing eye and ear protection while mowing.</li><li>Keep the ROPS, if equipped, in the upright position while mowing.</li><li>Allow a safe zone of two mower widths around hazards, like water, retaining walls, and drop-offs.</li><li>Avoid driving on steep slopes in excess of the mower’s capability. Consult the owner’s manual for details.</li><li>Blow debris off the deck after every use.</li><li>Sharpen the blades, grease the spindles, and inspect the belt after every 25 hours of mowing. Save time by keeping a second set of blades ready to go.</li><li>Change the air filter every 50 hours.</li><li>Change the motor oil every 100 hours.</li></ul>",306
293,stand on mowers,"<p>We considered several criteria when narrowing the field of stand-on mowers to our list. A good stand-on mower should have ample power to get the job done, so we chose models with at least an 18-hp engine. These mowers should also be comfortable to ride over long periods, so we favored stand-on mowers with suspension systems and cushioned bars. Since stand-on mowers come in a variety of sizes, we included smaller models capable of fitting through narrower gates as well as larger mowers that can handle several acres of land. Wheel size determines how well a mower can handle rougher terrain, so we selected models with larger wheels. Finally, we chose mowers made by manufacturers with a well-established reputation in the lawn mower business or tool industry.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Stand-On Mowers </h2> <p>Although the best stand-on mowers are certainly an investment, they make sense for professionals and some homeowners. The speed and wide cutting decks that stand-on mowers offer make them ideal for those who need to mow several acres of lawn. Since the operator stands on this type of mower, it’s a good choice for those who may suffer from back pain after long periods of sitting. The standing position also puts the operator at a higher vantage point, allowing them to see the surrounding terrain easily. Stand-on mowers are also simpler to maneuver through tight passageways.</p> <h2>Fast cutting speeds</h2> <ul><li>Good for those who suffer from back problems</li><li>Higher vantage point makes it easier to see terrain</li><li>Easy to maneuver around obstacles</li></ul>",251
294,rain barrels,"<p>To choose the best rain barrels, we evaluated each product’s features, price, materials, and capacity. We evaluated the design of the barrels, including filter screens, overflow spouts, and spigots to determine which models were the easiest to use while still holding up to the elements.</p> <p>Although aesthetics weren’t a priority when evaluating front-runners for the best rain barrels, they were a consideration since rain barrels are often outdoor components located in plain sight. Overall, the highest-rated products with the most convenient features and the best durability were chosen for this list.</p> <h2>Tips for Rain Barrel Use and Maintenance </h2> <p>Rain barrels are designed to be outside and to weather the elements. However, most manufacturers suggest keeping a rain barrel inside and turned upside down during the off-season. Consider storing a rain barrel in a shed or garage during the winter to protect it from freezing temperatures if it’s not being used. Always clean a rain barrel before storing for best results.</p> <p>In addition, when connecting a hose to the spigot of a rain barrel, be sure the hose is below the water level of the rain barrel for the water to flow properly. Users also have the option of not using a hose and instead filling a jug or watering can with the collected water.</p> <ul><li>Always install a rain barrel on a stable, flat surface.</li><li>Connect a rain barrel to the downspout for overflow to prevent water pooling.</li><li>Never use collected water for potable (drinking or cooking) purposes without filtering it first.</li><li>Drain barrels before freezing temperatures are expected.</li></ul>",255
295,honda lawn mowers,"<p>Buying a lawn mower is an investment in the care and maintenance of your lawn, so it’s worthwhile to take some time and consider which mower best suits your needs.</p> <p>Honda mowers are among the top options on the market today—with good reason. They have powerful engines and feature a range of user-friendly features. In choosing the models in this lineup, we focused on featuring a variety of models from different Honda mower series. We chose only one push-type model since many folks appreciate the self-propulsion function on a mower. Still, professional landscapers may prefer the simplicity of a push-type model, believing that these basic workhorses are less likely to have functional frailties.</p> <p>We ended up with more models from the HRZ series since they offer more user-friendly options. Still, Honda employs the same care and reliable engine in all its models, so users should choose based on their individual needs.</p>",151
296,john deere lawn tractors,"<p>In choosing the tractors for this lineup of John Deere-specific lawn tractors, we focused on what we felt were among the most common residential yard-care needs. We selected models from a range of prices because no two yards—or budgets—are identical.</p> <p>We looked for models that offered standard John Deere features, such as hydrostatic transmissions and easy-to-see fuel gauges that make mowing more user-friendly. Then, we hunted down models best suited to specific needs such as the need to mow tight radiuses around multiple trees or to cut closely along the edge of a fence or structure.</p> <p>The result is a lineup with an array of John Deere lawn tractors within a range of power levels and price tags. Still, each of the chosen models is suitable for use with multiple John Deere attachments to extend each one’s versatility.</p>",138
297,riding lawn mowers for two acres,"<p>Putting together a list of the best riding lawn mowers for 2 acres started with extensive research into a wide range of products. It was necessary to research the engine, mower type, fuel capacity, battery capacity, deck size, safety features, transmission, wheels, and more in order to gain a clear perspective on which products stood out from the competition.</p> <p>Product selection was limited to riding mowers that were suitable for 2-acre lawns, but otherwise there was a significant variety of potential choices, including options in both the gas and electric riding mower categories. The final selection was based on providing top-quality options that could handle the required task. Some products made the list because of outstanding features or impressive specs, while other lawn mowers stood out for reliable operation and affordable pricing. Availability was another deciding factor because it’s difficult to research and review products that you can read about but cannot find.</p>",153
298,outdoor wood sealers,"<p>Wood sealers are designed to provide a waterproof exterior layer in order to protect the wooden structure, furniture, or object to which the sealer is applied. For the purpose of putting together this list of the best outdoor wood sealers, it was necessary to conduct in-depth research into a wide range of more than 40 products.</p> <p>The type and transparency were primary factors in the final decision because they affected the application, drying time, and resistances. Water isn’t the only hazard for exterior wood objects and structures. Opaque or semitransparent sealers provide UV protection and help to prevent the wood from drying and cracking.</p> <p>Water-based sealers are easier to apply and clean up, though they don’t cover as well as oil-based sealers, so you may need more than one coat. Additionally, low-VOC or zero-VOC products were preferred over high-VOC sealers that could have a serious impact on the environment. Color selection, price, and quantity were also taken into consideration to choose the best outdoor wood sealers for exterior furniture and wooden structures.</p>",172
299,garden tractors,"<p>Putting together a list of the best garden tractors wasn’t a small task. After all, this is a category with very loosely defined criteria. First, we had to define our own parameters for the category before we could consider the best models.</p> <p>Once we had criteria to choose from, we called upon our team’s experience with lawn care and power equipment to pick out the most important specs and features. We then performed extensive product research to develop a pool of some of the best garden tractors on the market. Finally, we compared the models to ensure that they offered enough value and met our criteria, tossing away those that didn’t cut it and giving the ones that did awards based on their strengths.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Garden Tractor</h2> <p>Garden tractors are faster and generally have larger mower decks than standard ride-on mowers. These features allow DIY lawn-care pros to cut their lawns faster and with fewer passes, letting them move on to other projects or simply get back to weekend relaxing.</p> <p>The best garden tractors can handle a variety of attachments and add-ons to improve their usability. Add-on tools or attachments like snow blowers, snow plows, seed spreaders, wood chippers, backhoes, and pole-hole diggers make getting the job done faster and more efficiently.</p> <p>Garden tractors are generally more over-built than a typical ride-on mower. This allows them to handle rougher terrain, heavier-duty work, and longer days without feeling the strain. Lighter-duty machines may experience more frequent breakdowns, slipping belts, tire failure, and other issues resulting from light-duty construction.</p> <ul><li>Garden tractors are fast and have wide mowing decks for faster work.</li><li>Users can purchase additional attachments to improve functionality.</li><li>Garden tractors are more over-built than light-duty riding mowers.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using and Maintaining Your Garden Tractor </h2> <p>One way to ensure a garden tractor’s mower deck lasts as long as possible is to clean it after each use. Most decks have a garden hose adapter that the user can hook a hose to. With the mower deck engaged and the water running, the blades will kick water all over the underside of the deck to loosen clippings.</p> <p>It’s also important to service the engine at regular intervals. In general, change the oil, oil filter, fuel filter, and air filter every 50 hours or at least once every summer. The spark plugs should also be changed as frequently.</p> <p>Here’s another helpful tip: Be sure to keep the garden tractor’s user manual in a safe but easily remembered place. These manuals will have all of the parts and their identifying numbers listed, allowing users to quickly order replacement parts without guesswork.</p> <ul><li>Clean grass clippings from the deck after every use.</li><li>Service the engine regularly.</li><li>Keep the owner’s manual handy.</li></ul>",454
300,lawn mower snow blower combos,"<p>Choosing a list of the best lawn mower snow blower combos wasn’t a small task. We had to draw upon all our experience with lawn equipment, lawn mowers, snow blowers, and snow removal. This allowed us to pick out the features we felt were most necessary in a lawn mower snow blower combo.</p> <p>Next, we performed extensive product research to find models we felt met our criteria. With a pool of eligible models to choose from, we started comparing the features, functions, prices, and quality to ensure that we were recommending models that offered actual value. Lawn mower snow blower combos that failed were discarded, while those that remained were given rewards based on their strengths.</p> <p>Note: Although there are lawn mower and snow blower combination machines available in one kit, none of them made our list. They were often underpowered or far too expensive. We found that a DIYer should know and trust their tractor or lawn mower before adding the snow blower attachment to their yard equipment arsenal.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Lawn Mower Snow Blower Combo</h2> <p>Even with a traditional snow blower, removing snow from a long driveway can be an arduous task. Using a lawn mower snow blower attachment allows the user to sit down and steer the machine, which is much less work than pushing the snow blower down the driveway.</p> <p>Lawn mower snow blower combos are able to remove more snow than standard snow blowers. By using the tractor’s more powerful mower, the snow blower won’t bog down as easily, allowing it to handle heavier snow accumulations. Some models can handle more than 20 inches at a time.</p> <p>Lawn mower snow blower combos are more versatile than traditional snow blowers or snow plows. They’re able to go places snow plows cannot, such as walkways and sidewalks, but they have much more power and they’re easier to use than traditional snow blowers.</p> <ul><li>They’re easier to use than traditional snow blowers.</li><li>Lawn mower snow blowers can clear more snow than traditional snow blowers.</li><li>Lawn mower snow blower combos are more versatile than plows or snow blowers alone.</li></ul>",350
301,wind chimes,"<p>Adding a soft tune to your front porch, lawn space, or porch can provide calm and ambience, day or night. Many of the wind chimes in our top picks are made with different sound preferences in mind with the added benefit of strong construction, different aesthetic styles, and weather-resistant capabilities.</p> <p>Some of the featured chimes are made with aluminum or wood that can withstand high winds, rain, and light abrasions with ease while also creating your choice of soothing sounds or tunes. Some of these picks also have light seashell construction or are made with sustainable bamboo for the eco-conscious consumer.</p> <p>Finally, some of the above options come with hanging hardware included or additional attachments like birdhouses. However, please be conscious of the length and weight that some of these chimes are when hung, as some reach up to 48 inches long and over 6 pounds in weight.</p>",148
302,christmas inflatable,"<p>Several years of experience covering products for the home as well as extensive product research went into choosing our final curated selection. We reviewed over 30 Christmas inflatables and weighed a number of practical considerations when making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Theme: We aimed to include inflatables that would suit a number of different holiday themes by featuring products with classic Christmas motifs—like Santa and elves—as well as more winter-themed inflatables featuring animals or snowmen.</li><li>Reviews: Since so many Christmas decorations are only available seasonally and change from year to year, it can be difficult to find products with a significant number of ratings or reviews. Still, we did give priority to products that were well reviewed, and when reviews weren’t available, made sure to showcase decorations by reputable brands that consistently put out high-quality products.</li><li>Value: We took into consideration the fact that Christmas inflatables are only on display for a few weeks each year so sticking to a budget is a priority for many shoppers. We only included products that offered great value and were durable enough to last for years.</li></ul>",179
303,solar christmas lights,"<p>With a sea of options to choose from, it can be tough to narrow down the best solar Xmas lights to illuminate your home. We narrowed down this list from more than 30 options, making sure to include a diverse selection in our top picks. We considered the different types of Christmas lighting and their function. To suit a vast array of Christmas displays, we chose a range of lighting to match, paying mind to style, size, and colors.</p> <p>Through product research and consumer reviews, we chose reliable and beautiful solar-powered lights. We prioritized lights that are affordable, have good charging and runtimes, and are easy to install and use. For many, Christmas lights are the highlight of outdoor holiday decor, so aesthetics were also a priority in our selections. We chose a range of festive and fun designs and colors to create beautiful holiday lighting.</p>",146
304,flower subscriptions,"<p>For this somewhat unusual consumer guide, we assigned a writer with years of experience covering home products. We put in extensive product research, exploring more than 30 flower subscription options and weighed a number of practical considerations when making our recommendations.</p> <ul><li>Sustainability: We prioritized companies that are committed to eco-friendly and ethical farming practices in product sourcing.</li><li>Flexibility: Flexibility is key to any kind of subscription service, so we focused on companies that allow you to cancel without a financial penalty and that also offer the option to pause floral deliveries as needed.</li><li>Value: Floral subscriptions can be pricey, so while we included a couple of high-end picks, we prioritized companies that offer affordable options or bouquets at a range of price points.</li></ul>",121
305,kids picnic tables,"<p>In selecting our top picks in kids picnic tables, we performed extensive research. We started by reading articles explaining the desirable qualities of kids picnic tables and detailing specific recommendations. We took note of high-quality products that stand out from the rest. Next, we read product descriptions for more than 30 kids picnic tables to find the most desirable features. These products are available on the market from more than a dozen manufacturers and retailers.</p> <p>As we researched products, safety was our top consideration. We looked for nontoxic materials and child-friendly designs, such as rounded edges on tables and benches. Next, we looked for durable models that can withstand hard wear and tear. Additionally, we searched for kids picnic tables that are easy for adults to assemble and disassemble. Desirable features that made the cut include umbrellas for shade as well as units designed to fold flat for storage or transport.</p>",151
306,solar birdbath fountains,"<p>The best solar birdbath fountains are good-looking as well as eco-friendly and economical to run. We considered a few criteria when narrowing down the top solar birdbaths, including the design, materials, and solar power features.</p> <p>Solar birdbath fountains are appealing for their convenience and easy installation. To ensure the solar fountain works as promised, we considered shopper reviews to find options with reliable solar power functions. We also chose a few options with battery backup and one with an AC adapter for those that want to operate the fountain on cloudier days.</p> <p>Birdbaths aren’t just for the pleasure of our feathered friends; they’re also a garden decor piece. With this in mind, we prioritized birdbaths with attractive designs. To suit different tastes, we chose a range of styles, including plenty of charming traditional birdbaths, a colorful glass birdbath, and a more modern option. To keep the birdbath performing and looking its best for years, we stuck with options made from durable and easy-to-clean materials.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Solar Birdbath Fountains </h2> <p>Setting up and maintaining a solar birdbath is quite simple. To attract more birds, place the birdbath in a semi-shaded area with enough sunlight to power the unit, but not so much that the water evaporates too quickly. Some branches and plants nearby will be appealing to birds, but don’t place them too close to areas where predators can hide. Avoid placing the birdbath near windows or directly under plants or a bird feeder. Windows are a collision hazard, and plants or feeders will drop debris into the birdbath.</p> <p>Once the birdbath is set up, maintenance mainly comes down to regular refilling and cleaning. Avoid letting the birdbath run dry, as this can damage the pump. Frequent cleaning is crucial, both for the health of birds and the appearance and operation of the birdbath. Ideally, the birdbath should be cleaned two or three times a week (although once a week may be enough for some), or whenever you notice the water is becoming dirty or discolored. A dirty birdbath isn’t just unpleasant for birds, it can also spread disease and encourage pests. Make sure the solar panel is also clean for optimal operation.</p> <p>During cold winters, it’s best to bring the birdbath inside or use a birdbath heater or bird-safe anti-freezing products to prevent the water from becoming ice.</p> <ul><li>In most gardens, a semi-shaded spot close to bushes or trees is the best area to place a birdbath.</li><li>Avoid placing birdbaths directly under or beside trees and bushes, near windows, or too close to areas where predators can hide.</li><li>Refill the birdbath frequently and avoid letting it run dry.</li><li>Clean the birdbath one to three times a week.</li><li>Take steps to prevent damage or frost in the winter.</li></ul>",454
307,grill tongs,"<p>To ensure that this list of grill tongs included a balanced selection of top products, it was necessary to have a foundation of grilling experience. Additionally, we undertook extensive product research to determine the key product factors that impacted the convenience and practicality of each product.</p> <p>We considered the length, material, style or type, and any unique features that made a product stand out from similar options. The length was necessary for determining the appropriate grill size for the grill tongs, while the material indicated whether a set of tongs was useful in high-heat situations or if they were better suited for sensitive surfaces, like nonstick and enameled cast iron.</p> <p>This top list includes standard grill tongs, hybrid grill tongs, and bundles with more than one type of grill tool. The products were selected to give users more choices while highlighting the benefits of each grill tool. However, products with special features were given some preference, like those with built-in hanging hooks or custom designs.</p>",165
308,finish for kitchen table,"<p>We researched the most sought-after wood finishes for kitchen tables in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, ease of application, curing time, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best finishes for wood tables, the most popular types among users were the urethane, polyurethane, wax, and wipe-on options with their easy to moderate application and quick drying times. While many options require multiple applications, many of these top picks fully cure in 2 to 24 hours and last for years between applications. Multiple wood finishes and quantities are offered for select finishes like satin and semi-gloss, with options that are suitable for untreated and softwood tables and materials.</p>",125
309,gas grills under 1000,"<p>We considered several criteria when choosing our top grills under $1,000. Durability is vital when it comes to gas grills, and a grill that costs upwards of $1,000 should be able to endure the elements for many years. With that in mind, we primarily chose grills with thicker gauge steel construction both in the body as well as on the burners and interior heat distributors.</p> <p>A grill at this price point should also have additional features that make it easier to cook, including sear burners, side burners, and specialized cooking kits, such as a rotisserie or smoking box. We also favored grills with cutting-edge technology, such as smart temperature monitoring systems. Brand is critical in grills, and no brand dominates the under-$1,000 market like Weber, which is well-known for build quality and performance.</p>",133
310,small dehumidifier,"<p>We used several criteria to narrow the field of dehumidifiers down to the top picks for our list. A dehumidifier should be capable of removing a significant amount of water vapor from the air. With that in mind, we chose models that had the capacity and dehumidifying power to remove enough moisture to lower the humidity in at least a 150-square-foot room.</p> <p>Since dehumidifiers have basins with a limited capacity, we chose models with auto-shutoff features that turn the unit off when the water tank is full, preventing overflows. The dehumidifier’s dimensions were also an important factor when making our selections. We chose full-size dehumidifiers for basements and living areas and compact models for small spaces, such as in an RV, crawl space, closet, or bathroom.</p>",126
311,smart thermostat,"<p>We researched the most sought-after smart thermostats in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their connectivity, size, voice control capability, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The above models can connect to Google Home, Amazon Alexa, SmartThings, Apple HomeKit, and Wink to be compatible with your home’s current smart home system. Many are compact enough to fit on a wall or shelf without taking up space and most are easy to install without professional help. Some of these smart thermostats also come with room sensors, voice control, and intuitive control panels for ease of use and convenience.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Smart Thermostat</h2> <p>Convenience and reduced utility bills top the list of reasons to install a smart thermostat, but those are not the only reasons. Here’s a few more:</p> <ul><li>Users turn the heat (or AC) up or down remotely.</li><li>The device programs the HVAC system to run less when no one’s home for added energy savings.</li><li>Some smart thermostats provide energy use tracking and analysis to help users understand where loss occurs.</li></ul>",179
312,air purifier for pets,"<p>The right air purifier can cleanse the air pollution in your home of pet odors like dander and kitty litter. Each of the above picks was selected for its effectiveness, size, noise level, and user-friendliness.</p> <p>The above picks are effective at removing particles, toxins, and odor in rooms of 200 to over 1000 square feet with HEPA, activated carbon, or UV air purification. Many of these units also have multiple layers to their filtration to remove 99% of the noxious material from the air.</p> <p>These air filters also run quietly as they work with the loudest option being 40 decibels. Select filters also have a sleep mode that operates silently through the night. Additional special features included in these models are a child-lock feature, color-coded air quality monitor, auto-adjustment based on changes in the environment, and washable and reusable filters.</p>",140
313,air purifier for allergies,"<p>Those who suffer from allergies know that the right air purifier can ease respiratory problems while creating peace of mind. Selections for the best air purifiers for allergies depended upon their filtration type, square feet covered, noise level, airflow and filtration settings, and added special features included by select brands.</p> <p>We researched the most sought-after air filtration systems in their respective categories and discovered that activated-carbon, UV, and HEPA air purifiers were among the most popular filtration types on the market. Not only do these types reduce the dust, pollen, and volatile organic compounds in your home’s air, but select models are also capable of reducing odors and eliminating toxic particles of 0.1 microns in size.</p> <p>With this efficiency, keep in mind that many of the above picks are made for a certain size of space, ranging from 185 to 1,060 square feet depending upon where filtration is needed. Most also come with noise levels under 59 dB (which is the volume of a typical conversation) and as low as 17 decibels (which is nearly silent). For added convenience, many air purifiers come with multiple modes or settings including an automatic or night mode.</p> <p>Finally, some of the above air purifiers are made with multistep filtration, are compatible with mobile apps, have built-in air pollution sensors, or are portable air cleaners that can be moved from room to room.</p>",229
314,portable air conditioner,"<p>These recommendations for the best portable air conditioner cover a variety of types and styles to suit different user needs. Our curated selection was developed based on extensive product research. We weighed a number of practical considerations when making our recommendations.</p> <p>We included options to suit a variety of room sizes, narrowing our selection to ACs that feature multiple fan settings and operating noise levels under 57 decibels. We also gave preference to models that offer additional features like a dehumidifier setting to help save shoppers money in the long run.</p> <h2>Our Top Picks</h2> <p>In keeping with the criteria outlined above, the following list features some of the best portable AC units on the market today.

Those with small spaces and budget-minded shoppers may appreciate the BLACK+DECKER model, which offers excellent performance at a lower price point.</p> <h2>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Portable Air Conditioner</h2> <p>Take some time to think of the various features and functions available in portable air conditioners before deciding on a specific product. Factors like single- or dual-hose configurations, energy consumption, cooling capacity, room size, and even the noise produced by the portable AC should be considered before making a purchase.</p> <h3>Single vs. Dual Hose</h3> <ul><li>Single-hose AC units pull warm air from the space around it, cool the air, and dispose of heat and moisture through a hose that leads outside. These models are typically cheaper than their dual-hose counterparts but have one significant drawback: Since the unit relies on already-cooled air to bring down the temperature of the condenser, considerable energy goes to waste.</li><li>Dual-hose AC units have both an intake and outtake hose. The intake hose draws in outdoor air to bring down the temperature of the condenser. The separate outtake hose disposes of the heat, humidity, and used air from the indoor space. While pricier, dual-hose units are more efficient and generally the wiser option, particularly for larger spaces.</li></ul> <h3>Functions</h3> <p>Portable air-conditioning units have several different functions available depending on the product, including standard AC, evaporative air coolers, heaters, air purifiers, and humidifiers/dehumidifiers.</p> <ul><li>Standard AC units function by pulling in stagnant air from the room and pumping it over cold coils to cool the air. Warm air and excess moisture are expelled to the outside through a hose. This function rapidly cools the air in the room.</li><li>Evaporative air-cooler models typically use ice or cold water to cool the air in the room. The portable AC uses a fan to pull warm air in through a wet sponge or bucket of ice, then the same fan pushes the cool air out through the front of the portable air conditioner to cool the room. However, this function does not have the same level of cooling power as a standard AC.</li><li>Heaters can sometimes be built into portable air conditioners, giving the user the ability to switch between heating and cooling and enabling use throughout the warm and cold months of the year.</li><li>Air purifiers are designed to pull in dust, dirt, hair, and other contaminants, trapping them in a filter and pushing out cleaner air. While some portable ACs include an air purifier function, this is a relatively rare and high-end feature.</li><li>Humidifier/dehumidifier models increase or decrease the moisture in the air. Many portable AC units can act as dehumidifiers to pull in moisture and push out drier air, though it’s less common for a portable air conditioner to have a humidifier mode. Evaporative air-cooler ACs act as humidifiers while also cooling the air, so a specific humidifier setting isn’t as necessary.</li></ul> <h3>Room Size</h3> <p>The size of the room matters when choosing a portable air conditioner, so be sure to select a unit with the appropriate output for cooling the space. Portable air-conditioner manufacturers will often provide the output of the device in British thermal units (BTUs), with each BTU equal to the amount of heat that the AC unit can remove from a room.</p> <p>The output of a portable air conditioner ranges from about 3,000 BTU to 15,000 BTU, though evaporative air coolers do not measure output in BTUs. The cooling ability of these devices is directly connected to the temperature of the water or ice in the cooling sponge or bucket.</p> <p>Typically, the cooling area of an evaporative air cooler is measured in cubic feet per minute (CFM). Calculate the necessary CFM for the target room by multiplying the length, width, and height of the room to find the volume, then dividing the total by 2: CFM = (L x W x H) ÷ 2.</p> <h3>Energy Efficiency</h3> <p>Air conditioners with a BTU rating of 10,000 or higher are typically the most efficient at cooling a room, but the higher the BTU, the louder and heavier the model. Most AC units also come with an energy efficiency ratio (EER). A higher EER rating equates to greater efficiency; EER indicates the ratio of the air conditioner’s BTUs per hour to its power input, measured in watts.</p> <p>In other words, cooling a larger space requires more BTUs, and some units are built with greater energy efficiency than others. The EER weighs output and input against each other to show how effective and efficient the unit will be. Many portable air conditioners have EER ratings between 8.5 to 10; any rating higher than 10 is ideal.</p> <h3>Portability</h3> <p>If the intent is to regularly move the AC unit around, consider investing in a smaller portable AC that’s easy to pick up. These devices range from just 2 pounds to up to 80 pounds, so size does make a big difference in portability.</p> <p>Look out for portable air conditioners with handles on the side or back of the unit, which can make it easier to pick it up and adjust the positioning. Some portable ACs have wheels on the bottom of the unit as well. This is an especially helpful feature to move the air conditioner over a flat surface without needing to lift it off the ground.</p> <h3>Noise Level</h3> <p>In the past, air conditioners, fans, and heaters were known to produce very high noise levels due to the hum of the motor, fan blade rotation, and the force of the expelled air. Today, product advancements have significantly reduced the noise produced by these devices through intelligent engineering and enhanced insulation that dampens the sound.</p> <p>The average AC unit now produces about 50 to 60 decibels (dB) of sound, while the quietest portable air conditioner options may only be 40 to 45 dB. For perspective, the sound of a person whispering is about 30 dB, a normal conversation is 55 to 65 dB, and ambient noises in a busy office or restaurant range from 70 to 80 dB.</p> <h3>Additional Features</h3> <p>Standard portable air conditioners are easy to use, allowing the user to circulate cool air throughout the home. That said, some products come with extra features that can make them more convenient and user-friendly:</p> <ul><li>Timers keep the portable air conditioner on for a set period of time. Once it reaches the end of this period, it will automatically shut off instead of running all day, which helps keep electricity costs low.</li><li>Programmable settings on a portable air conditioner can include fan speed settings, set temperatures, temperature ranges, sleep mode, and more. These settings are meant to provide complete control over the unit. A smart portable air conditioner can even integrate with smart-home systems like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant to control the AC unit using voice commands.</li><li>Night-lights are a good option for those who walk around a fair amount at night, since the added illumination helps prevent injury (like accidentally kicking the air conditioner).</li></ul> <h3>Installation and Maintenance</h3> <p>One of the main benefits of choosing a portable air conditioner is its typically easy installation. Standard portable AC units need an available power outlet and a place for the hose to filter out excess moisture and hot air. This is accomplished by running the hose through a custom frame that sits inside an open window, creating a seal around the window and around the hose to prevent leaks.</p> <p>Alternatively, evaporative air coolers don’t have a hose that has to run outside, but they do need cold water or ice in the sponge or bucket to cool the air that passes through the unit. Both styles require regular cleaning and may need to be drained if they have a dehumidifier function that collects water from the ambient air.</p>",2778

The above water filters also vary between 1-inch and ¾-inch inlets or connections to be compatible with your home’s current water system.</p> <p>Cartridges are also key in whole-house water filtration systems, which is why most last anywhere between 3 month and 1 year depending upon water consumption and filtration type. Finally, each of the above water filtration systems is easy or moderately difficult to install. But, most come with informational guides and kits which should make the process easier.</p>",190
316,lunchboxes for construction workers,"<p>Beyond the considerations above, a few additional aspects affected our picks.</p> <h3>Variety</h3> <p>A construction worker’s lunch isn’t always a simple sandwich or flask of soup. There’s nothing wrong with those things, but many people have more varied tastes or more complex dietary requirements. What we tried to do was find solutions for all needs, hence the wide range of lunch boxes for construction workers featured.</p> <h3>Practicality</h3> <p>Construction sites are rugged and sometimes dangerous places, so any lunch box that’s used on-site must be tough. We also considered the durability of each model that made the list and even sought out one that’s robust enough to function as a seat.</p> <h3>Value</h3> <p>While we wanted to offer a range of prices, we eschewed cheap lunch boxes for construction workers that wouldn’t live up to the demands of the job. Low cost isn’t good value if the lunch box falls apart after a couple of weeks. Sometimes it’s worth investing a little more.</p>",160
317,dual fuel generator,"<p>The best dual fuel generators provide reliable backup power to the home with either gasoline or propane and ensure your home can keep running if the electricity goes down in the area.

323,stump killer,"<p>We extensively researched dozens of products for this lineup. Brand reputation played a role—reputable manufacturers with well-vetted products that were high on customer satisfaction were given top consideration. Still, we didn’t automatically eliminate lesser-known or niche brands as long as the products contained ingredients known for killing stumps.</p> <p>We kept in mind that stump-killing needs vary. Some users want to get rid of old, seasoned stumps, so we included products that help dead stumps decompose faster. Others are looking to stop volunteer trees from growing where they shouldn’t be growing, and we also considered that need.</p> <p>To make our lineup, products had to be effective and reasonably simple to use. We allowed for some dilution because many users prefer a concentrated product. We also included products that require drilling holes in a stump before application, as that may be the best way to kill a stump.</p> <h2>Do You Need a Stump Killer?</h2> <p>Unwanted trees and shrubs do cause problems; their roots can penetrate drainage lines and they can ruin the look of a well-manicured landscape. That said, you might want to consider some nonchemical stump-remover solutions.</p> <ul><li>Grinding: Professional stump-removal companies use large machines to grind away tree stumps below the level of the yard, and then the roots of the stump can be covered with soil and planted with grass to match the rest of the yard. The cost of having a stump ground down will vary, but expect to pay in the ballpark of around $150 to $450, depending on the stump’s diameter.</li><li>Natural stump killer: Vinegar and Epsom salt will both kill a green tree stump and keep it from coming back up from the roots, although it will take longer than a chemical stump killer. Plan to drill holes in the stump’s surface and fill them with white vinegar or Epsom salt. You may need to retreat the stump a couple more times if shoots appear.</li><li>Try composting: Eventually, a dead stump will decompose, but it could take years. You can hurry the process along by creating a compost pile right over the stump. Construct a cage around the stump using something like chicken wire and then fill it with dry leaves and vegetable food waste. Water occasionally to keep the compost damp. As the material biodegrades, it will encourage the stump to decompose more quickly.</li><li>Incorporate the stump into the landscape: Upcycling a tree stump to support a small bench or table (depending on height) can add a whimsical touch to the yard, and no chemicals are needed. Use your creativity—a taller stump could even serve to hold a bird bath or squirrel feeder.</li></ul>",435

As a bonus, we added a combination smoker and grill for those who prefer to smoke their food no matter where they are.</p>",121
327,washer and dryer,"<p>To select the best washer and dryer sets available, it was necessary to conduct extensive research into more than 30 products to compare the highlights, drawbacks, and detailed specifications of each washer and dryer set. We narrowed down the potential choices by contrasting and comparing the various types of washer and dryer sets, including front-load, top-load, stacked, stackable, side-by-side, and combo units that were capable of both washing and drying.</p> <p>The size and capacity of each machine was also important for determining whether the product was better suited for a house, apartment, dorm, or even an RV. Products that featured a wide variety of wash cycles or helpful smart technology were typically preferred over more basic models, though energy efficiency was also a key feature to keep in mind during the selection process.</p>",133
328,quiet fan,"<p>The quietest fans can help to create white noise while you sleep, or run all day in your home office while you work. Selecting the best quiet fans depended upon their noise levels, design, adjustability, power, and portability.</p> <p>Each of the fans above runs under 60 decibels which is about the noise level of a regular conversation.

Though you are looking to regulate and control the humidity in your home, always be aware of your humidifier’s settings to avoid adding too much moisture in your space. It is recommended that you keep a room under 50 percent moisturized as anything more can cause mold and mildew to grow.</p> <p>Another thing to be aware of when using a humidifier is the type of water to use in your tank. A good practice is to always use distilled water rather than tap water as this prevents unsavory particles from filtering through the humidifier and into the air. Finally, always be sure to clean your humidifier properly so it can maintain proper functionality. Here are a few more tips to keep in mind for operating a humidifier correctly:</p> <ul><li>Before refilling your humidifier’s tank, be sure it is completely dry and empty to avoid standing water and mold.</li><li>If your humidifier requires a filter, be sure to monitor when it needs to be replaced.</li><li>It is recommended that you leave a door open in the room where the humidifier is placed to avoid over-humidifying a room.</li><li>Warm mist humidifiers that boil water can become hot to the touch. Please exercise caution if you live in a home with pets or animals.</li></ul>",424
330,standby generator,"<p>Trying to choose the best whole-house generator from the wide range of available products isn’t an easy task. It was necessary to conduct extensive research into over 30 different generators to put together this list of the top standby generators for your home. The key factors we considered during the selection process included wattage, fuel source, transfer switch, and physical dimensions.</p> <p>Low-wattage and high-wattage generators were chosen for this list because smaller homes don’t have the same power requirements as larger homes. Similarly, dual-fuel generators were preferred because it’s always better to have a generator that can run on more than one type of fuel in an emergency.</p> <p>Typically, standby generators either come with a transfer switch or need to have one installed to transfer power to the home. Generators with automatic transfer switches make this process easy instead of needing to rely on the user to switch the power manually. Additionally, any standby generators with special features, like wireless monitoring or a liquid-cooled cooling system, were considered superior to similar products that lacked these features.</p>",176
331,portable air purifiers,"<p>When researching air purifiers, we considered not only their features, but how those features interact within the design. We considered noise levels, filtration stages, size, and weight.</p> <ul><li>Noise levels: Not all manufacturers provide the decibel levels of air purifiers. However, for those that did, we looked for an optional low-decibel setting.</li><li>Filtration stages: The most common filtration stages are a mechanical HEPA filter and an activated carbon filter. We considered the effectiveness of each and how well they worked to remove particulates and odors.</li><li>Filter maintenance: We looked at the ease of replacing filters and how often they need replacing. We noted models with difficult-to-replace filters.</li><li>Size and weight: A portable air purifier needs a small footprint and low weight.

333,robotic pool cleaner,"<p>To put together this list of top robotic pool cleaners, it was necessary to extensively research more than 30 products to determine the standout features and shortcomings of each pool vacuum. We paid close attention to the cable length and pool type as these two factors could be used to determine the situations a product was best suited to tackle.</p> <p>Overall cleaning time of a standard cleaning cycle, as well as the ability to schedule or remotely control the cleaning cycle and function of the pool vacuum also were considered. Any products with special features that improved efficiency or user convenience were preferred over similar models that lacked these qualities or functions.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Robotic Pool Cleaner</h2> <p>Regularly cleaning your pool is a must, though it’s a time-consuming and tiring chore.

You must prepare your home for the treatment, apply the treatment, vacate your home to let the product work, and then clean up after use.

For instance, not all listed products are dust collectors, but every product on the list can be used to make dust collection easier, such as the Rousseau 5000 Dust Solution.

If the damage is bad enough, it might be best to call in a professional upholsterer. However, for light to moderate repairs, a leather repair kit could be just what you need to do the repairs yourself.</p> <p>Aside from the money you save by fixing furniture yourself, having a leather repair kit on hand enables you to regularly maintain your furniture so that it can be yours for years without looking shabby and worn.

A desk needs to have enough surface area for a gamer to connect multiple accessories or peripheral devices that are essential for gaming. It also needs to be able to support the weight of the computer, monitors, and any other equipment that will be sitting on the desk. As long as a product fulfilled these requirements, it was considered for selection.</p> <p>Extensive research into over 40 gaming desks provided additional information, like height-adjustment settings, cable management, construction material, and any add-ons that could help a product stand out from similar options, such as a built-in mouse pad, cupholder, or headphone hook. The dimensions and shape of each product were also considered because it was necessary to note if a desk was too small, too large, or shaped in such a way that made it difficult to set up in the average home office or gaming room.</p>",165
351,kneeling chair,"<p>To offer ergonomic benefits, a kneeling chair must fit the user. Though most kneeling chair types offer good back-pain relief, some are not adjustable, so it helps to know the average heights a chair will accommodate. In addition to adjustability, durability and weight limits mattered while choosing these picks, as did a chair’s angles. Seat comfort is also essential and requires good padding, upholstery, and distance from the seat to the shin pad.</p> <p>We considered the mobility of sitters while using a kneeling chair, along with the chair’s ability to roll on caster wheels. Finally, some chairs are easier to store, and a few chairs on this list, like the Varier Variable Balans Original Kneeling Chair, look so nice that there is no need to hide them.</p>",127
352,l shaped desks,"<p>When researching L-shaped desks to find our top picks, we took the most common features into consideration. We looked at materials, offering a selection of laminate, metal, wood, and glass options depending on shoppers’ preferences. We also took care to include only products that are made from durable and reliable materials—able to provide users with a perfect place for their workstation for years to come.</p> <p>Our research showed us that many users enjoy the added flexibility of height-adjustable desks, so we made sure to include a pick that can transform from a sitting desk to a standing one at the touch of a button.</p> <p>Lastly, in terms of ergonomics, we included several options for users that included footrest bars, which help users who find themselves at their desks for extended periods.</p>",131
353,kids bed with desk,"<p>Since bedrooms can often be tight on space, it can be difficult to fit everything a child needs and wants in their room. A bed with desk and storage underneath is the perfect solution to this problem, and our list of recommendations provides a range of options to choose from that will satisfy the most common requirements. Whether shoppers are looking for short desk spaces for arts and crafts with additional shelving and storage for books and toys, or they need a much larger desk area for growing kids who find themselves with plenty of homework, our top picks include the best products to choose from in terms of space and construction.</p> <p>Speaking of construction, the last thing shoppers want is a bed so shaky that they dare not climb in for fear of collapse, so our research has ensured that our favorite beds are all known for their durability and sturdiness.</p>",152
354,sit stand desk,"<p>We researched the most sought-after sit stand desks in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, construction, height adjustability, weight capacity, size, and other special features included by select brands to enhance your comfort while working in a sitting or standing position.</p> <p>The above list prioritizes variety by including rectangular and L-shaped options as well as standing desk converters, most of which come with motorized height adjustment with the push of a button. While manual options are less popular, these models are usually made for smaller homes or offices. As for height adjustment, our picks for the best adjustable standing desks offer a broad range from 5.5 inches to an ample 50.5 inches, with many picks allowing you to program your desired height.</p> <p>Many of our picks are also made with sturdy steel constructions and scratch-resistant laminate or wood surfaces for long lifespans and durability. Small and large options are also featured above with varying weight capacities ranging from 40 to 235 pounds. As for additional features, we selected options that also come with desk hooks, built-in wheels, cable management, and even built-in shelving units for ample storage.</p>",195
355,murphy bed,"<p>A new Murphy bed can be a costly purchase, and if you’re opting for a wall-mounted version, it’s even more crucial to buy a high-quality and long-lasting bed. Safety and durability were front of mind when we considered the best Murphy beds due to their high cost and the fact that they mount on the wall.</p> <p>Wall-mounted Murphy beds must be secure, and uninstalling the bed can be a big job, so it’s important to find a Murphy bed that is safe to use and built to last. We also considered ease of opening and closing, prioritizing beds with easy-to-use opening mechanisms.</p> <p>Murphy beds are usually chosen for their space-saving designs. Keeping that in mind, we selected several beds with extra features, including built-in desks, sofas, and storage, as well as some cabinet and portable Murphy beds. Lastly, design was an important aspect we considered, and we looked for classic designs with attractive finishes to suit most homes.</p>",158
356,recliners for seniors,"<p>Lift recliners can make it easier and safer for elderly individuals to get in and out of a recliner. We focused on the priorities that every person wants in a chair, so the chairs on this list needed to be comfortable, practical, and safe. We considered product specifications and consumer reviews to narrow down this list from more than 20 recliner options.</p> <p>Safety is paramount when it comes to any product, but especially when used by those with limited mobility. We looked for smooth-moving chairs with an ergonomic design and a decent weight capacity to suit most users.</p> <p>Recliners for seniors also need to be easy to control—no one should have to fiddle around with a complicated remote just to get out of a chair. To ensure these criteria were met, we chose highly reviewed products with user-friendly controls.</p> <p>We looked for comfortable and stylish designs with ample padding and a shape that envelops the body for ultimate relaxation. The lift chairs on this list also look nice, with attractive designs, textures, and colors. We chose from a range of colors and materials to suit different shopper preferences.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Recliners for Seniors</h2> <p>Lift recliners are one of the best recliners for seniors and individuals with limited mobility. They are essentially recliners that lift you up, making it easier to lower into the seat or stand from a seated position.</p> <p>Lift recliners look and feel the same as traditional recliners, so they have all the comfort perks of a regular recliner, with the added benefit of a mobility aid. Since lift recliners are electric powered, they are also very easy to use. With the press of a button or the flick of a switch, users can adjust them to their liking.</p> <p>Beyond being easy to use, lift recliners are also a safe addition. Sitting down and standing from a low seat (like many traditional recliners) can be difficult for stiff or achy joints, and it can even create a fall hazard for some individuals. A lift recliner can help seniors safely maintain their freedom and independence for longer.</p> <ul><li>Comfortable and easy to use</li><li>Include mobility aids to help seniors sit or stand</li><li>Helps maintain senior independence</li></ul>",368
357,massage chairs,"<p>We considered more than 35 massage chairs for our top picks. With so many choices at different price points, choosing a massage chair can be a stressful experience.</p> <p>To suit different shoppers, we considered massage chairs at different price points, evaluating each chair on massage coverage, types, programs, and setting variability. Through extensive product research and focusing on the best massage chair brands, we chose chairs that live up to their relaxation promises: vibrating, kneading, and rolling away muscle tension.</p> <p>Comfort can be nonnegotiable, so it’s one of the first features we evaluated. A cozy chair is the bare minimum, so we also looked for chairs with extra features like heating, reclining, and full body massage features. We also prioritized massage chairs with customizable settings (like intensity options, body scan features, and a wide program selection) so users can choose their ideal massage. With these features in mind, there’s likely a massage chair on this list to suit most shoppers.</p>",160
358,paper shredder,"<p>Paper shredders are used in homes, home offices, and professional workspaces to destroy documents that contain sensitive information. With this in mind, security was an important factor while we considered the various options for the best paper shredder. The type of shredder was also noted, with preference given to micro-cut devices due to the security offered by the increased number of particles produced from a single sheet of paper.</p> <p>Considerable research into each product helped to sift through choices that were admirable but fell short of the competition in some way, such as the page capacity, portability, or dimensions. Any products with extra features that improved the shredding capability of the device or otherwise improved on the design were favored over similar products that lacked these additional elements.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Paper Shredder</h2> <p>A paper shredder is designed for cutting through several sheets of paper at once, shredding them into small pieces that are difficult to read, sift through, or piece together. However, without regularly cleaning and lubricating the blades with paper shredder oil, the device can jam, overheat, and break down.<br/> It’s also important to avoid overloading the shredder. Each product comes with a recommended page capacity, and when that capacity is exceeded, the motor needs to work harder to ‌keep up with demand. Similarly, forcing paper into the shredder faster than it can handle will probably cause the motor to overheat. Or, at the very least, cause premature wear and tear on the machine, shortening its working life.</p> <ul><li>Regular maintenance can help improve shredding capabilities.</li><li>Overloading the shredder can result in premature wear.</li><li>Don’t force paper into the shredder.</li></ul>",270
359,cable management,"<p>With such a wide selection of cable-management solutions on the market, we set out to help shoppers by providing a list of recommendations to choose from. We made sure to include multiple types of cable management, such as zip sleeves, coiled plastic tubing, adhesive backing runners, and Velcro ties, which are sure to meet the needs of most users.</p> <p>While gathering our top picks, we wanted to make sure that most of our options came in multiple colors to ensure that they could blend easily into the wall, floor, or desk area. Reusability was also another important factor, so we chose to avoid single-use options wherever possible to avoid forcing shoppers to buy solutions continuously as they move cables and devices around the home.</p>",124
360,lunch box,"<p>We considered a broad range of criteria while reviewing dozens of options for our list of the best lunch bags and boxes. Since a lunch box is designed to go on the road, we chose lunch boxes with durable designs and materials that can endure the rigors of a construction site or school backpack. Insulation is also key if packing a lunch that needs to stay cool or warm, so we made sure to include models that could keep food cold (or warm) for at least 4 hours.</p> <p>A lunch box design should also make it easy to pack and unpack food and drinks, so we chose lunch boxes with large lids or flaps that grant full access to the lunch box’s interior. And, since style is important when heading to the workplace, we also included several of the best lunch boxes for adults that workers can proudly carry and display in the office.</p>",154
361,gun safes,"<p>For gun safety and peace of mind, the right gun safe can protect your firearms from the reach of children while offering easy access in case of an emergency. Selections for the best gun safe depended upon materials, size, lock type, security features, and other special features included.</p> <p>The carbon steel and solid steel constructions of these gun safes are able to withstand damage and tampering with added pry-prevention capability. For handguns or long guns like rifles and shotguns, there are also multiple size options available with select models also including small shelves or lockboxes for ammunition or accessories.</p> <p>Many of the above options are made with biometric or password-protected locks for peace of mind and security, some of which are compliant with the FBI, TSA, OR CA DOJ. For added security features, some of these models are integrated with locking bolts, interior lights, foam-lined interiors, or even mounting hardware.</p>",150
362,ant killer,"<p>The best ant killer can ensure that your home or garden has ample ant and pest control. Many of our above top picks are made with formulas that are safe for homes with pets and children while also lasting for weeks or months at a time. Chemicals in these picks such as borax, bifenthrin, indoxacarb, and zeta-cypermethrin are proven to be effective at killing ants and other insects for all-around prevention.</p> <p>The above picks are also fast-acting with the full effects being delivered immediately or within 72 hours. These ant killers are also easy to apply or set up by pouring dust, spraying with a hose, or laying 1 or multiple bait stations in your home. Many of the outdoor formulas are also made waterproof for more lasting effects. Conveniently, some of these formulas also attach themselves to ants and then carry poison back to the colony, killing the queen and all ants within.</p>",154
363,laminating machine,"<p>Years of experience covering home and office products as well as extensive product research went into creating this guide. We explored more than 25 laminating machine options and weighed a number of practical considerations before making our recommendations.</p> <p>One of the specs that differs from machine to machine is maximum paper width. We included a variety of options for those who need to laminate small household documents as well as larger posters and display items. Two important factors to consider when choosing a laminating machine are warm-up speed and laminating speed.</p> <p>We gave preference to models that are ready to use in just a few minutes and operate at speeds of at least 9 inches per minute. Laminating machines vary in price, with some professional models costing thousands of dollars. We aimed to ensure that everything we included in our recommendations offered excellent value based on the price.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Laminating Machine</h2> <p>Choosing the right laminating machine is just the first step when it comes to ensuring documents are properly laminated. The following tips will help ensure that everything you laminate will be safely preserved for years to come.</p> <ul><li>Be sure to carefully center the item you’re laminating within the pouch.</li><li>Check that you’re using the right pouch size; there should be at least 3 millimeters of laminating material around the edges of the item.</li><li>Prevent air bubbles by ensuring the temperature of the machine is high enough.</li><li>Before laminating items that have great monetary or sentimental value, do a test run with an object of a similar size and shape.</li><li>Never laminate an empty pouch.</li></ul>",264
364,soft pastels,"<p>These recommendations for best soft pastels include several inexpensive beginner sets as well as more professional sets at a higher price point. The quality of the beginner sets is quite good and meets most expectations in terms of vibrancy, blending ability, and use on several mediums. Furthermore, we chose sets of pastels that offered a variety of colors to choose from, depending on how many shades buyers prefer to experiment with. All of these soft pastels are dry chalk based rather than oil based, though some are a little harder than others.</p> <p>We further narrowed down our selection by the size of the sticks to include regular and small pieces that may work better for detailed art. Several top art brands were also included to ensure our list contains products with a track record of quality.</p>",136
365,carpenter ant killer,"<p>A good carpenter ant killer should be an effective and safe way to eliminate these wood-destroying insects from the home. With that in mind, we selected products that use active ingredients that are proven to kill ants without harming the home’s occupants. To be effective, an ant killer needs to have an impact on more than just the ants taking the bait, so we chose products that are capable of destroying entire colonies. Moreover, we chose ant killers that may take longer to start working but will ultimately eliminate the ant problem more effectively than those products that kill on contact.</p> <p>In terms of safety, the user shouldn’t have to come into contact with the bait, so we selected products that limit the exposure of the active ingredient to the person applying it. Where possible, we chose eco-friendly products containing all-natural ingredients that are nontoxic to people and pets.</p> <h2>Tips for Keeping Carpenter Ants Away Naturally</h2> <p>Although there are plenty of products that use chemicals to take out carpenter ants, there are also many ways to keep carpenter ants at bay without having to use a pesticide. Carpenter ants are attracted to wet and rotting wood. Those who keep their homes well maintained and who repair any damage as soon as it’s spotted won’t attract carpenter ants.</p> <p>Carpenter ants also like heavily wooded areas, so keep brush and tree limbs away from the home’s exterior. Likewise, make sure mulch and soil do not come into contact with the wood parts of the home. Cracks and crevices around the home’s foundation can serve as an entryway for carpenter ants. Sealing these gaps will make it harder for carpenter ants to find a way in.</p> <ul><li>Repair leaks and water damage immediately.</li><li>Keep brush and tree limbs off of the home.</li><li>Don’t allow landscaping to come into contact with wood parts of the house.</li><li>Seal cracks and crevices around the home’s foundation.</li></ul>",316
366,paint for glass,"<p>We researched the most sought-after paints for glass in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, form, durability and longevity, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>To ensure our list was as broad as possible, we included chalk, water-based, translucent, and acrylic paints that come in bottled, spray, and pen forms. The majority of these options are permanent to ensure they are heat and dishwasher-safe, while the temporary options offer versatility for seasonal holiday decorations or storefronts.</p> <p>Plus, many of the paints in our above list come in various colors and can be used on multiple surfaces including glass, ceramics, wood, paper, and canvas. Finally, select paints listed above are safe for children to use and are U.S. ASTM D-4236 and European EN71-3- compliant.</p>",137
367,fabric dye,"<p>We researched the most sought-after fabric dyes in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, form, compatibility with multiple fabrics, quantity, ease of application, colorways, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>To ensure we included the best fabric dyes on the market, we included liquid and powdered direct, fiber-reactive, and acid dyes that are compatible with synthetic, acrylic cellulose, protein, blended, and natural fabrics.</p> <p>While many appear to come in small quantities, each of the above products can dye 1 to 2 pounds of fabrics using vat, tub, tie, airbrush, dip, shibori, printing, painting, and batik dyeing techniques. As for colorways, the fabric dyes listed above come in 12 to 34 colors. Plus, some of the options included in our list are vegan, cruelty-free, non-toxic, and safe for septic systems.</p>",139
368,wax melts,"<p>We researched the most sought-after wax melts in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, quantity, scent options, compatibility with multiple warmers, and other special features.</p> <p>While searching for the most popular wax cubes, paraffin and soy wax options were among the most popular for their ease of use and strong scents. Many of our featured wax melts come in multiple fragrances and packs. Moreover, some options can burn for over 180 hours.</p> <p>To limit the amount of chemicals in your home, the selected melts contain 100-percent natural essential oils. These melts work with electric, non-electric, and light-bulb warmers. They can eliminate odors in kitchens, bathrooms, bedrooms, and living spaces.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Wax Melts</h2> <p>Both scented candles and wax melts introduce pleasant fragrances into the air. For safety, wax melts have advantages over scented candles.</p> <p>Whereas candles have open flames and should never be left unattended, many wax warmers operate on electricity for a safer alternative. Non-electric wax warmers require tea lights for heat, but these tiny candles are contained in fireproof tin cups in partially enclosed areas of the heat-proof wax warmers. Even non-electric wax warmers offer greater peace of mind than scented candles when considering fire safety.</p> <p>The sensation of scent, fragrance, or odor is perceived through stimuli on the olfactory system. Research indicates that these stimuli are processed in the brain according to emotional content, which explains why scents have both positive and negative emotional associations. Pleasant scents may elicit calmness, relaxation, well-being, fond memories, and other positive emotions.</p> <p>For this reason, wax melts provide additional advantages for individuals who want to enhance ambiance and create a fragrant indoor environment. Depending on the scent associated with a positive emotional response, wax melts may elicit a variety of pleasant feelings. They can:</p> <ul><li>Eliminate unwanted odors from cooking, pets, and other sources</li><li>Promote relaxation</li><li>Create a clean, fresh environment</li><li>Elicit positive memories and pleasant associations</li></ul>",322
369,heat press machines,"<p>After exploring dozens of heat-press machine options, we considered several criteria before choosing our picks. The top models are made well and designed to apply HTV or sublimation ink effectively and efficiently. We based our choices on brand reputation as well as each machine’s durability, performance, and price.</p> <h2>How to Create a Quality Print With Your Heat Press</h2> <p>Picking the right heat press depends on the type of items it’s intended to customize, the size of the surface area, and the frequency with which it will be used. The best-quality heat-press machine has the ability to heat evenly and apply consistent pressure across the transfer, as well as built-in safety features. On any heat-press machine, making a quality print requires the same steps.</p> <ol><li>Choose the right heat transfer paper to match the heat setting on the press.</li><li>Use quality ink, and remember that sublimation transfer requires sublimation ink.</li><li>Set the heat press controls.</li><li>Lay out the item to be pressed, eliminating creases and wrinkles.</li><li>Position the transfer on the item.</li><li>Close the heat press.</li><li>Use the correct amount of time.</li><li>Open, and remove the transfer paper.</li></ol>",179
370,wood chipper,"<p>These recommendations for best wood chippers span a range of models that are built to chip, shred, or mulch branches and yard debris. We’ve included several electric models that work well for the average yard that typically includes small branches and some leaf debris. Several more powerful gas-fueled wood chippers on the list will handle larger branches of up to 3 inches in diameter. This variety offers buyers more options to meet their specific needs.</p> <p>We included models with optional attachments that enhance the range of possible applications, such as vacuum attachments to collect leaves for mulching or tow bars to attach the chipper to a riding lawn mower. Several units come with mulching bags, while others feature a directional debris chute without a bag. These wood chippers also come in a range of weights (23 to 139 pounds), but wheels and handles make them fairly easy to maneuver.</p> <h2>How to Use a Wood Chipper Safely</h2> <p>Not for nothing, wood chippers make frequent appearances in horror films. This incredibly dangerous yard tool should only be operated by an experienced user who is sure to take the following safety precautions:</p> <ul><li>Read the manufacturer’s instructions thoroughly before use.</li><li>Use hearing protection, eye protection, hand protection, and a hard hat.</li><li>When feeding branches into the wood chipper, do not force stubborn branches into the blades. Let the chipper pull them in while you stand to the side to avoid flying debris.</li><li>Keep hands and any other body part away from the wood chipper when it is connected to a power source. A simple accident could result in severe injury or death.</li><li>Always disconnect the power and the spark plug before performing maintenance on your wood chipper to ensure that it does not start up while you are vulnerable to the blades.</li></ul> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Wood Chipper</h2> <p>Having your own wood chipper comes with many advantages, but the most obvious benefit is the yard waste disposal it provides. Old trees may give out at any time, and yearly trimming is necessary. This can leave you with a substantial pile of wood and yard material to remove. With a wood chipper, you still need to take the time to feed the material into the chipper, but you can easily dispose of or use the wood chips that are produced.</p> <p>Wood chippers are also a useful tool to reduce the potentially harmful emissions produced by burning chemical-treated wood. Instead of releasing these toxic fumes and unpleasant odors into the air, you can mulch the wood and use it to protect your plants.</p> <p>Besides mulch, you may also create pressed wood for carpentry projects or biofuel for fuel certain cars or other machinery.</p> <p>To recap, a wood chipper:</p> <ul><li>Quickly removes unwanted waste.</li><li>Provides an environmentally friendly means of disposing of yard waste.</li><li>Produces useful materials like mulch, pressed wood, and biofuel.</li></ul>",470
371,electric snow shovel,"<p>In selecting the best electric snow shovels and snow blowers for our list we considered specific criteria as they pertained to the unit’s intended use. For power shovels designed to handle walkways and small driveways, we favored models that are lightweight with ergonomic handles–making them easier to maneuver in tight spaces–with a snow clearing width of around 12 inches and a depth of around 6 inches. For larger driveways and heavier snowfalls, we chose small single-stage electric snow blowers with the ability to clear a swath of about 20 inches wide at a depth of at least 10-inches.</p> <p>For cordless models, we considered snow shovels and blowers that would provide enough run time to allow them to clear a walkway, for smaller snow shovels, or small driveway, for snow throwers. With that in mind, we chose snow shovels with at least 25 minutes of run time and snow blowers with at least 45 minutes of run time. We also favored models with rapid chargers that could get the shovel or blower back online in about 30 minutes.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning an Electric Snow Shovel</h2> <p>Electric snow shovels are easier to use than a manual snow shovel and less expensive than a full-size snow blower. They expedite snow removal so you have more time for sledding, snowball fights, or staying warm indoors.</p> <ul><li>Reduces back, arm, and shoulder pain and fatigue associated with shoveling snow.</li><li>Quickly removes fresh snow to an average depth of 6 to 8 inches.</li><li>Lightweight and easy to handle (most weigh under 15 pounds).</li></ul>",255
372,camping lantern,"<p>We tried to cover all the bases when choosing the best camping lanterns. First, we called upon our experiences as campers and adventurers to select the most important features campers need in a lantern.</p> <p>Next, we performed extensive product research, comparing features like runtime, output, battery source, and weather resistance, which helped us narrow the field. We then assigned awards based on each lantern’s strengths to help streamline the shopping process.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Camping Lantern</h2> <p>Proper lighting on a campsite helps keep everyone safe. Campsites are rarely perfectly flat, and most have roots and rocks that create serious tripping risks. The best camping lanterns illuminate these hazards in the dark.</p> <p>The best camping lanterns can extend the day for friends and loved ones even after the sun goes down and the fire goes out. Lanterns light the way to prepare food, play games, or relax and swap stories. They’re even useful in the backyard at home.</p> <p>A camping lantern can also make a great emergency lantern. Since these lanterns are rugged enough for the great outdoors, they can serve as backup lights and power sources during major storms and other natural disasters.</p> <ul><li>Camping lanterns illuminate rocks and roots on a dark path.</li><li>Lanterns extend the day on a camping trip.</li><li>A camping lantern can act as a backup energy and light source during a power outage or storm.</li></ul>",229
373,tent heater,"<p>When the sun goes down and the temperature drops even further, a tent heater can help you sleep comfortably throughout the night and wake up nice and warm. We researched product specifications and consumer reviews to gauge the best tent heaters for each respective category, and discovered that the best models have ample heat distribution, lightweight constructions, long runtimes, and added special features.</p> <p>Most models are powered by propane, butane, or electricity, each type offering ample heat distribution. While electric options emit 700 to 1,500 watts of heat (roughly 95 degrees Fahrenheit), propane and butane heaters emit 2,890 to 9,000 BTUs for large or small tent sizes. As these heaters are meant for portability, most picks weigh between 1 and 10 pounds and either have small constructions or can be disassembled while on the move.</p> <p>The tent heaters in the above list can also run for 1 to 28 hours depending on how long you need the heat, and some designs are constructed with 360-degree heat distribution, tip-over protection, and automatic shutoff. But, keep in mind that both propane and butane give off fumes, so the tent needs to be well ventilated while you use models with this fuel source.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Tent Heater</h2> <p>When used safely and correctly, tent heaters are an excellent piece of camping gear that allows outdoor enthusiasts to pursue their passions in cold weather. Follow these essential tips when buying and using a tent heater.</p> <ul><li>Consider a tent heater that shuts off automatically when it tips over, overheats, or detects low oxygen levels.</li><li>Gas heaters should be used only in tents with proper ventilation. Consider having a carbon monoxide detector on hand to monitor oxygen levels.</li><li>Always keep heaters at least 3 feet from tent walls, sleeping bags, fabrics, and other flammable surfaces.</li><li>Carefully read the user manual of any tent heater for specific manufacturer safety tips and recommended uses.</li></ul>",314
374,gas grill,"<p>Our top picks included in this list of recommendations take careful consideration of the major aspects shoppers look for when buying a new grill. In terms of size and weight, these needs will vary widely from user to user, so we made sure to include a range of options, from very large cooking areas for big backyard barbecues like the Weber Genesis II 4-Burner Liquid Propane Grill down to portable options such as the Pit Boss Grills Stainless Steel Portable Grill, which is a great on-the-go cooking solution.</p> <p>Naturally, a vital component to a gas grill is temperature, how well it can be controlled, and how effectively it can maintain an even temperature throughout to avoid the dreaded hot spots that will burn any food that comes near it. As such, all of our recommended options stand out for their ability to maintain even heat.</p>",145
375,home generator,"<p>The right home generator can protect you from losing food in the fridge, regulate heat in your home, or power devices in the event of an extended power outage. Each of the above home generators was selected with power output, runtime, fuel/energy type, and special features in mind.</p> <p>These generators each have a high power output of 1,000-22,000 watts with electrical charging, gas or propane, or even solar power. Many of these picks also have multiple outputs for phones, appliances, and even RVs. Runtimes of these selected generators are also very generous with some options being operational for up to 16 hours.</p> <p>These home generators include unique features on top of their obvious practical use, with some picks including wheels, folding handles, weather-resistant constructions, easy electric starts, and even wifi connectivity for alterations and monitoring.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Home Generator </h2> <p>Operating a generator isn’t complicated, but there are a few tips you should keep in mind to ensure effective and safe operation and avoid any harm to yourself or your generator when the power goes out.</p> <p>First of all, it’s important to use extension cords that are sufficiently powerful. If you aren’t using a transfer switch, running undersized cords from your generator to your appliances can present a fire risk and also damage both the generator and connected appliances.</p> <p>As a general rule, use at least 12-gauge electrical cords for larger appliances (like refrigerators) and at least 14-gauge cords for everything else. Cord length is also a concern since the voltage drop from cords that are too long can damage or destroy the appliances they’re supplying. Although you should keep a portable generator outside and away from your home, remember not to exceed a 100-foot extension cord length.</p> <p>When running a home generator, it’s best to keep it on a level surface. If a generator is placed on a slope or hill, the internal lubrication system could malfunction and lead to premature engine wear and damage. Finally, ensure the generator has cooled down before you refill it, since spilling gasoline on a hot engine can cause a fire.</p> <p>Keep the following tips in mind:</p> <ul><li>Prevent theft by securing your generator with a lock and chain if you store it outside.</li><li>Don’t run your generator with stale fuel to avoid start-up issues.</li><li>Keep extra oil and filters on hand to ensure you can maintain the recommended maintenance schedule through extended power outages.</li></ul>",401
376,flat top grill,"<p>Flat top grills make a great addition to an indoor or outdoor kitchen. The above choices offer substantially more cooking surface than a standard frying pan or even many grills. They also come in a broad range of sizes and are made in electric and gas types for your preferences and intended usage.</p> <p>Several of the above selections have large dual burners for optimal cooking convenience, and one model has a huge 720-square-inch cooking surface. Some are also made with dual textures for even more cooking capabilities. Additionally, many of the above picks are durable and long-lasting with cast-iron, cold-pressed steel, cast aluminum, and stainless steel constructions.</p> <p>The above picks are also made to accommodate a variety of cooking spaces by coming in either compact or spacious designs, many of which include easy temperature control, built-in side tables, built-in nonslip legs, and lockable wheels for portability.</p> <p>Finally, many of these options are made with portability in mind for your camping trip or outdoor picnic with lightweight constructions and built-in handles.</p>",170
377,mosquito yard spray,"<p>To suit the needs of many users, these recommendations for yard spray and foggers have been hand-picked to cover a number of common application methods for mosquito problems in yards of all sizes. Whether you prefer to keep a small mosquito barrier around your patio or spray an entire acre of land, there’s an option included to get the job done.</p> <p>We concentrated the coverage of hose sprays and aerosol canisters because their accessibility, light weight, and extreme ease of use suit most household needs. That said, we did select our favorite refillable machines for larger applications, focusing on options supported by backpack designs to increase mobility (and coverage) as well as decrease strain on the body.</p> <p>Just as important, we favor a few products that target mosquitoes and other flying insects but without negative consequences for the ecosystem. Two non-toxic options with plant-based active ingredients will not harm the environment—especially ideal for homeowners who have children and pets in the yard frequently.</p>",163
378,hose end sprayer,"<p>Our recommendations for best hose end sprayers include several options that allow users to control the dilution setting or produce a fixed amount of chemicals. This customization allows users to properly spray their gardens, trees, or acreage as needed. We’ve included products that work better in smaller areas and some that have more powerful streams to reach the tops of fruit trees. These recommendations also include variable flow adjustments for users to better control the amount of spray and the type of spray or stream.</p> <p>Each product is made of polyurethane reservoirs or jars that are designed to safely resist rusting and corrosion from the chemicals. We’ve included the more common plastic handles (some are ergonomic for extra comfort). Plastic is lighter than metal, but it’s also prone to wearing out or breaking quickly, which is why we included metal handles as well.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Hose End Sprayer</h2> <p>Hose end sprayers are an affordable way to improve the efficiency of applying pesticides, weed control, and fertilizers to yards, trees, landscaping, and gardens. Here’s a breakdown of the advantages of these handy tools.</p> <ul><li>They don’t require pre-mixing. Many hose end sprayers do the mixing for you, allowing you to add chemicals directly to the reservoir. This minimizes mess and exposure to harmful chemicals.</li><li>They don’t require pumping. Pump-style sprayers require the user to constantly create pressure inside the tank by pumping up the unit. Hose end sprayers use the pressure created by running water, eliminating the need for pumping.</li><li>They can cover a large area. Perhaps the greatest advantage of a hose end sprayer is its ability to cover thousands of square feet in a relatively short period of time. These products are the best option for treating larger areas, such as a lawn.</li></ul>",294
379,above ground pool vacuum,"<p>When it comes to pool cleaning, the best above ground pool vacuums really depend on both the budget and the expectations of the shopper. Our list of recommendations covers both ends of the spectrum, from top-of-the-line choices that allow users to fully automate their pool-cleaning chores to manual scrubbing heads that can give users more of a workout.</p> <p>Regardless of which type of above ground pool vacuum you are looking for, our top picks are proven to deliver excellent results and are made of high-quality materials that can stand up to heavy use. We also made sure to include products that suit a variety of pool shapes, since we know that not all swimming pools are rectangular. Our recommended products are able to conquer odd angles and scrub away the most stubborn dirt and stains.</p>",135
380,plugin air freshener,"<p>We researched the most sought-after plug-in air fresheners in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, size, fragrances offered, longevity, ease of setup and use, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>To ensure our list included top picks that satisfied a range of preferences, we included heated oil models, essential oil diffusers, air purifiers, and wax melts that are compact enough to fit standard wall outlets as well as tabletops and vehicles. While many options come with various fragrances, some options remove unpleasant odors with air purification and elimination without the use of natural or artificial fragrances.</p> <p>Though some options on our list provide unlimited usage, all of the other products listed above offer odor control for 4 hours to as long as 360 days at a time in small to large rooms. Each option is also easy to set up and use by simply plugging in or refilling a reservoir with water and compatible essential oils. Plus, these air fresheners are suitable for use in living room, kitchen, automotive, and bathroom spaces and their odors.</p>",185
381,indoor plant stands,"<p>We looked at stand types and sizes to select a range of top plant stands for various room sizes, decors, budgets, and plant-holding space. A large stand with multiple tiers can hold a prized collection, and some stands have wheels so you can help your plants follow the sun or tuck them out of the way if necessary. Material matters for both outdoor and indoor plant stands so they will hold up to water and look good where you place them. We also looked at style to match a home’s aesthetics and as a sign of sturdiness and safety.</p> <h2>FAQs About Indoor Plant Stands</h2> <p>Here are some answers to common questions shoppers have about indoor plant stands.</p> <h3>Q. How tall should a plant stand be?</h3> <p>That depends upon the use of the stand. Some are just tall enough to lift heavy pots off the floor, thus protecting the wood or carpet underneath. Others are tall enough that they require reaching up a bit to handle the pots on the top shelves. It’s a matter of personal preference.</p> <h3>Q. What do I put under plant pots indoors?</h3> <p>When a plant is kept inside, it’s important to protect the floor or other surface underneath the pot. Often a plant stand with a rimmed tray is suitable for this, but it depends upon the pot and the drainage the plant needs.</p> <h3>Q. How should I display plants indoors?</h3> <p>An attractive plant stand can make a single plant a focal point or can make a group of plants stand out.</p>",256
382,wax warmer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after types of wax warmers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their size, power source, wax capacity, materials, warming type, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best wax warmers on the market, the most popular type among users were ones with electrical cords for their portability and ease of use. While not as popular, wax warmers with a wall outlet power source are viable options to melt wax cubes and tarts as well as essential oils. No matter the type, each of the above options are all small and light enough to fit in any space and hold enough wax to produce a fragrant aroma wherever they are placed.</p> <p>As for aesthetics, the above options are made of metal, ceramic, glass, and wood to match your home’s fixtures and rely on either a bulb or heating element to produce warmth. But, the bulbed options emit a light glow and can double as a night light if needed. Plus, select picks come with an on-off roller or toggle switch, wax cubes or bulbs included, or removable bowls for after-use cleaning.</p>",196
383,christmas decorations,"<p>Home decor is a matter of personal taste, and your everyday decor will influence your Christmas decoration style. To suit a range of decor, we included a wide variety of Christmas decorations in different aesthetics. To dress up homes big and small, we chose items ranging from small trinkets to large inflatables. While each product might not work in every home, we prioritized style and chose products that were attractive or charming.</p> <p>Christmas decorations are only used for a few weeks a year, so we also kept price in mind. We chose affordable decorations from reputable brands to balance an accessible price point and good quality. Through product research and consumer reviews, we made sure to choose Christmas decoration products that are made to last for several seasons, so you can bring your favorite seasonal decor pieces out for years to come.</p>",142
384,outdoor doormats,"<p>A good outdoor doormat is an important but often underappreciated accessory for your front porch. We chose our top picks by conducting product research and reading consumer reviews, all with the goal of bringing you the best outdoor doormat options.</p> <div><div>Advertisement</div><div data-desktop-tablet-content=""""></div></div> <p>When narrowing down our doormat choices, we chose a variety of practical materials, all selected to withstand daily stepping, scraping, and scuffing. We looked for doormats with a simple-to-clean design, so you can shake off accumulated dust, dirt, and mud with ease.</p> <p>Beyond being functional and durable, an outdoor doormat should also be attractive since it is one of the first things guests see at your home. Since style is subjective, we chose many different colors and styles so you can find the right look for your porch. Lastly, an outdoor doormat is an essential home accessory that shouldn’t break the bank, so we also kept affordability in mind.</p> <h2>Tips for Choosing the Best Outdoor Doormat</h2> <p>Outdoor doormats are made of durable materials that trap dirt and water when you wipe your feet. Common materials include rubber, jute, coir, faux coir (synthetic materials made to mimic bristly coir), and other synthetic fibers. Nonslip options are best (and safest), so look for features like a rubberized backing to keep the mat in place. In addition to being water resistant or quick to dry, it should also be easy to clean with just a quick shake or vacuuming.</p> <p>Make sure to choose the appropriate size for your entryway. An outdoor doormat should look balanced in the doorway. For less busy households and small doorways, a smaller mat should do. Larger or double-door entryways with lots of comings and goings can likely benefit from a larger mat.</p> <p>Outdoor doormats are most often chosen for their style and color rather than their utility—and that’s perfectly fine. They are made to dress up your front door, after all. Consider the doormat’s design, color, or pattern. There are almost endless options available to suit any style.</p> <ul><li>Look for attractive, durable, and easy-to-clean materials.</li><li>Consider a nonslip backing for safety.</li><li>Keep size in mind.</li><li>Choose a design and color that complements your home.</li></ul>",355
385,room dividers,"<p>To select the best room dividers, we considered both their appearance and their functionality. Knowing that shoppers typically want a room divider not only to provide privacy but to also serve as decor, we looked at a broad array of attractive options.</p> <p>As a starting point, we read five articles detailing the qualities of optimal room dividers, as well as the product descriptions for more than 20 options. These represent more than 10 manufacturers as well as 12 online retail outlets. We focused on room dividers consisting of hinged panels that fold for portability and versatile use, which appear to be the most common type of room divider. They are available in a broad range of appealing styles, materials, and sizes. For variety, we included a shelving unit as well as a hanging macramé piece.</p>",135
386,drafting chairs,"<p>Whether it’s a chair for a traditional drafting table or the best drafting chair for standing desk setups, high-quality drafting chairs are supportive and comfortable to improve long workdays. When choosing the best drafting chairs, we placed comfort at the top of our criteria list. We conducted in-depth product research and considered shopper reviews to choose comfortable chairs, looking for ergonomic features such as contoured seats, supportive backrests, and sturdy footrests.</p> <p>Adjustability is an important factor for both comfort and ergonomics, so the more adjustable features a drafting chair has, the better. At minimum, the chairs on our list have adjustable heights, but we prioritized chairs with additional adjustable features, particularly footrest height adjustment and armrest adjustments. We also considered materials, choosing a range of upholstery types that appeal to both comfort and style. Lastly, we included several affordable options on our list, since comfortable work seating shouldn’t be expensive.</p>",150
387,utility sinks,"<p>In determining what utility sinks to include in our list of the top models, we considered what makes a utility sink useful. A utility sink is supposed to handle duties that the kitchen sink can’t, such as washing large objects (or even a pet) and filling tall buckets. With that in mind, we chose models with large capacities and deeper basins that would allow the user to fit larger items or animals in them.</p> <p>A utility sink should also withstand cleaning paintbrushes or washing tools, so we chose stainless steel and plastic models that are designed to resist chipping or cracking.</p> <p>Some people see their laundry rooms and garages as pure utility areas, while others decorate them as they would any other room in the house. Keeping that in mind, we chose a mix of more expensive sinks that add style to a laundry room and affordable models that prioritize function over style.</p>",153
388,airless paint sprayer,"<p>Airless sprayers can reduce the amount of time and stress it takes to complete a small or large paint job while delivering flawless coverage every time. We researched the most sought-after airless paint sprayers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, tip size, flow rate, weight, and ease of use.</p> <p>Based on the above list, corded models are favored among users for their high flow rates and the ability to use them for hours at a time. While less popular, the cordless models supply sufficient paint coverage, but often rely on batteries with limited paint times. Most of the above models have tip sizes of 0.015, 0.017, and 10 inches for either precise spray paint or large exterior projects.</p> <p>As for flow rate, the above picks range from 0.4 to 0.33 GPM based on your intended use and select picks are compatible with hoses of 25 to 100 feet long. Plus, many of these airless sprayers come with built-in piston pumps and reversible switch tips for reliability and troubleshooting. While some models are heavier to carry than others, most airless paint sprayers are lightweight and come with built-in handles or wheels for maneuvering.</p> <h2>Tips for Using an Airless Paint Sprayer</h2> <p>It’s important to consult manufacturer instructions when operating a paint sprayer, but in general, the process is as follows:</p> <ol><li>Make sure you have the correct filter and nozzle for the paint application.</li><li>Fill up the paint reservoir or guide the paint siphon hose into the paint bucket.</li><li>Prime the airless sprayer by adjusting it to the prime setting (if it has one) and drawing paint up into the hose with the pump. Allow some paint to drip out of the end of the hose so you know the system is fully pressurized.</li><li>Once paint is moving through the hose and into the sprayer, spray into a waste bucket to clear any air before beginning to paint your surface.</li></ol>",323
389,acrylic paint,"<p>We researched the most sought-after acrylic paints in their respective categories and discovered that the best picks are determined by their quality, consistency, number of color options, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and other special features included by select acrylic paint brands.</p> <p>While researching the best options on the market, heavy-body acrylics were among the most popular options for their ease of application and reliability while applying. Though less popular, the soft and fluid acrylics produce smoother effects for more intricate work. The above list also prioritizes the best quality paints, which is why the majority of our picks are artist-grade paint, while some are meant for beginners and kids.</p> <p>As for color options, our selection ranges from 1 to 12 tubes included for ample color options. For added versatility, these paints can be used on canvas, paper, glass, fabric, stone, and leather materials. Finally, some of these paint sets come with guides and reusable cases for long-term, practical use.</p>",159
390,interior paint,"<p>After exploring dozens of interior paint options, we considered several criteria before choosing our best interior paint picks. We based our choices on brand reputation and overall customer satisfaction. We also considered the paint’s versatility, usability, and price. The top choices feature excellent coverage and various sheen options, and many are low VOC.</p> <h2>Types of Interior Paint Finishes</h2> <p>All of our recommendations are available in various finishes, including the ever-popular eggshell and satin. These finishes are the most widely used for bedrooms, living rooms, or dining rooms thanks to how they balance durability of glossier paint finishes with the forgiveness of more matte ones—meaning they aren’t so glossy that they highlight imperfections in the wall. If you’re painting a bathroom or a kitchen, consider bumping up the sheen one level to a semi-gloss for extra resistance to water.</p> <ul><li>Flat/Matte: This finish has minimal shine. Matte/flat finishes provide excellent coverage and cover imperfections well. However, they are the least durable of all the finishes and best for surfaces that will not be touched much, like ceilings or formal dining rooms.</li><li>Eggshell: Eggshell is slightly more lustrous than flat paints. This finish covers imperfections, and they’re more durable than flat finishes. Eggshell paints are great for low to medium traffic areas, like living rooms, hallways, and entryways.</li><li>Satin: Satin is the most popular finish in interior paint finishes. This finish has a velvety sheen and is easier to clean than flat and eggshell paint finishes. Satin finish is a great choice for high-traffic areas like kitchens, playrooms, family rooms, bathrooms, and laundry rooms.</li><li>Semi-gloss: Semi-gloss finishes are shiny and reflective. This finish is extremely durable and mildew-resistant, so these paints are best used in kitchens and bathrooms.<br/> High-gloss: High-gloss paints have the shiniest and most reflective paint finish, and they are the most durable and washable. This finish is best for doors, trim, and cabinetry.</li></ul>",310
391,garage floor paint,"<p>We researched the most sought-after garage floor paints in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their type, coverage area, colorways offered, ease of application, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The above list prioritizes acrylic, latex, and epoxy paint as each offers durability by resisting scuffs, wear and tear, and stains. These above options vary between 200 and 500 square feet of coverage, offering viable options for one or two-car garages. While many who are looking to paint their garage floor usually look for a grey or white hue, select paints come in more colors such as yellow, red, or blue.</p> <p>Finally, the above garage floor paints are easy to apply with the average paint roller and dry in just a few hours.</p>",131
392,roof rake,"<p>Roof rakes are relatively simple devices used to remove snow from a first-story home without having to climb a ladder or leave the ground. With this purpose in mind, products were researched extensively to put together this selection of top roof rakes. The length, weight, material construction, and any extra features that improved the functionality of the tool, like an extendable reach, built-in slide, or wheels.</p> <p>In order for a roof rake to be selected, it needed to be long enough to comfortably clear snow from the roof without the user needing to climb a ladder. Additionally, the roof rake had to be lightweight, so that the user could hold the rake overhead and control the strokes of the tool. Preference was given to products with high-quality materials and any extra features that made a roof rake stand out from similar competitors.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Roof Rake</h2> <p>When you start to rake the snow off of your roof it’s important to begin the process by removing the snow from the edge of the roof first. If you attempt to extend the roof rake as much as possible and simply pull down any snow caught within this range there is a good chance that you will be unable to move the snow. Also, keep in mind that even if the snow does move, it isn’t a good idea to bring down that much snow at once because the weight of the snow could hurt you or someone nearby.</p> <p>While the goal of snow removal on a driveway is to clear any snow or ice that could cause the car to slip, you don’t actually need to rake every inch of snow off the roof. Leaving one or two inches of snow isn’t going to cause ice dams to form and this gap can help prevent the shingles from being damaged during raking.</p> <p>Additionally, under no circumstances should you attempt to climb a ladder or walk on a sloped roof in winter conditions simply for the sake of snow removal. The entire purpose of a roof rake is for the user to remain on the ground, so don’t take the risk of trying to rake the roof while perched on a ladder.</p> <ul><li>Start at the edge of the roof and work your way towards the center of the roof.</li><li>The roof doesn’t need to be completely bare.</li><li>Do not climb up a ladder or sloped roof in winter.</li></ul>",405
393,gutter sealant,"<p>Many DIYers have at one time or another been up a ladder cleaning a blocked gutter or attempting to fix a leak. In assessing the best gutter sealants currently available, the following criteria were considered.</p> <p>Manufacturer information is helpful, but in order to assess real-world performance and durability we felt it important to review feedback from actual buyers. Products with significant application problems or failures did not make the cut. It is not always possible to select environmentally-friendly products so wherever quality water-based products were available, they were chosen over solvent-based products.</p> <p>Value isn’t just about the cost per amount of a product. Generally speaking, even small containers could provide enough product for a single repair. So we also considered if the gutter sealer could be used for other tasks, thus offering better value for money.</p>",136
394,boot dryer,"<p>We researched the most sought-after shoe dryers in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, capacity, drying time, heat settings, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best boot dryers on the market, the most popular type among users appears to be convection/forced air dryers for their odor-control capabilities as well as their ease of use. Though not as popular, the positive temperature coefficient dryer is also viable for 360-degree drying in short shoes and boots. No matter the type, the above picks can dry 1 to 2 pairs of shoes simultaneously in just 30 minutes to overnight.</p> <p>While the majority of options come with only 1 heat setting, select picks have a heated or unheated option. Other special features we included in our featured picks include extension tubes, timers, length-adjustment, center-mounted fans and coils, and LED displays.</p>",150
395,travel backpack,"<p>We used several criteria to create our list of the top travel backpacks. A good travel backpack should be durable enough to endure the rigors of all kinds of travel, so we chose backpacks made from high-quality materials such as leather, canvas, and ripstop nylon with heavy-duty zippers. Since travel backpacks are frequently used for air travel, we chose models that are within the size restrictions for carry-on baggage while still having ample storage space.</p> <p>Organization is key when it comes to travel; we selected backpacks with multiple compartments and pockets to suit everything from clothing to laptops to keys. A travel backpack should also be comfortable, so we looked for backpacks with cushioned shoulder straps and such features as chest straps and compression straps.</p>",125
396,fireproof document bag,"<p>We researched the most sought-after fireproof bags in their respective categories and discovered that the best options are determined by their heat resistance, size, materials, versatility, and other special features included by top brands.</p> <p>While searching for the best fireproof bags available, the most popular picks among users were made with double-coated, silicone-coated fiberglass to withstand temperatures of up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Each of the above picks is large enough to fit small to large documents including legal forms, birth certificates, and passports while also being capable of holding jewelry, electronics, and cash.</p> <p>Not only do these fireproof bags defend against intense heat and flames, but many are also water-resistant or waterproof for complete protection. Plus, select picks come with shoulder straps, handles, interior pockets, and even combination locks.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Fireproof Document Bag </h2> <p>Merely sticking your documents in a fireproof bag offers a measure of protection, but don’t stop there—always store the bag in a safe spot. A few tips can help you get the most protection from your bag.</p> <p>When selecting a fireproof document bag, consider going a size larger because you’ll likely find additional items you want to store.<br/> The higher the fire-resistant rating, the safer your items will be. For optimal protection, look for a bag that can withstand at least 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.<br/> Put only dry items in the bag. Fireproof bags can trap moisture inside, making the documents smell musty or encouraging mold or mildew. Make sure all papers and valuables are dry before putting them in the bag.</p>",258
397,wallets for men,"<p>Most people grab their wallets every time they leave home, so it doesn’t hurt to have a nice one. A wallet can be as much of an accessory as a useful way to carry money and cards, so we kept both style and function in mind.</p> <p>When choosing the best wallets for men, we considered the wallets’ material, design, safety, and convenience features. Through extensive product research, we looked for wallets that keep cards and cash safe, are pleasant to carry around, and look nice.</p> <p>We looked for durable materials with leather being a popular pick because it ages beautifully. In terms of design, we included several different types of wallets, from money clips to extra-large wallets. We evaluated how well each wallet takes advantage of its space, prioritizing wallets that hold cash and cards smartly and snugly. Last, we flagged safety and convenience features, such as RFID-blocking materials and removable ID holders that offered extra peace of mind and value.</p>",161
398,ornament storage,"<p>Proper storage can help your ornaments last for years. We considered over 20 ornament storage products to narrow down our top picks, taking product specifications and consumer reviews into account.</p> <p>Different ornaments have different storage needs, so we included a range of ornament storage types made of a variety of materials, including acid-free and lined options for storing delicate ornaments.</p> <p>Regardless of the storage type, performance was the main feature we looked for. We chose ornament storage solutions with reliable enclosures, useful dividers, and a decent capacity to organize your Christmas baubles. Lastly, we kept affordability in mind, choosing both budget-friendly and high-end products so any home can take advantage of a smarter way to store Christmas ornaments.</p> <h2>Tips for Storing Christmas Ornaments</h2> <p>Whether you adorn your tree with sparkly plastic ornaments or vintage heirlooms, you’ll want to store your decorations properly so they last through the seasons. The first step is to make sure you have an appropriate container in which to store the ornaments. Look for an option with suitable dividers to ensure ornaments don’t knock around, and choose materials that are acid-free if you’re storing delicate ornaments.</p> <p>To remove any dust or dirt, ornaments should be cleaned carefully before storing. A light dusting is enough for most ornaments. While some ornaments can handle wet cleaning, avoid water when cleaning very delicate or painted ornaments.</p> <p>When the ornaments are ready for storage, carefully place them into your chosen Christmas ornament storage box, ensuring that ornaments are placed in a way that they won’t rub or hit against each other (one ornament per compartment is the best way to keep them safe). Very delicate ornaments can be wrapped in acid-free tissue paper. It’s best to store ornaments in a temperature-controlled room that remains dry and cool throughout the year. In short, take the following steps to safely store Christmas ornaments:</p> <ul><li>Clean ornaments before storing.</li><li>Wrap delicate ornaments, if needed.</li><li>Store ornaments in a box with appropriate dividers.</li><li>Place the Christmas ornament storage container in a dry, cool, and temperature-controlled room.</li></ul>",338
399,firewood rack,"<p>This group of firewood rack recommendations aims to provide the full range of features shoppers most often look for in a firewood storage rack. With airflow being a vital aspect of storage to keep wood dry and seasoned, every product on our list provides a degree of airflow. In terms of capacity, we made sure to provide a wide range of sizes to meet most needs, from small indoor spaces all the way up to huge outdoor storage operations.</p> <p>In addition to function, due consideration was also given to aesthetics—since firewood racks can add a sense of style and charm to a home, our product picks span a range of styles, from modern geometric designs for minimalist spaces to the more traditional rustic look for timeless farmhouse decor.</p> <p>Lastly, all our recommended products are either very easy to put together or require no assembly whatsoever.</p>",145
400,wardrobe,"<p>This list of recommended wardrobes is curated taking a wide variety of shoppers’ needs into account—from sturdy and lasting furniture additions to temporary storage solutions in a pinch. Our wardrobe favorites can provide a statement, high-quality piece to a home or simple and effective storage that can be easily moved around the house as needed.</p> <p>One aspect that is often sought in a wardrobe is flexibility in how the shelves and rods can be arranged. As such, most of our recommendations include modular features that allow users to create the setup that works best for them.</p> <p>In terms of style, we made sure to cover both classic and traditional looks in addition to modern and contemporary options to satisfy the range of decor choices that shoppers are seeking. Several of our top picks also offer multiple finishes to choose from, ensuring shoppers are able to match their new wardrobe to their taste.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning the Best Wardrobe</h2> <p>There are several reasons why a good wardrobe is a worthwhile investment. Let’s take a look at why it’s an excellent idea to buy one.</p> <ul><li>There’s more space for clothing. Sometimes a closet just isn’t enough, especially if the space is shared with another occupant. A freestanding wardrobe can provide a place for an individual to keep their clothing separate from others or offer room for “overflow” items. Some use a wardrobe to store seasonal clothing while not in use.</li><li>It keeps a room neat. When clothes pile up, it can be tempting to throw them into baskets, boxes, or corners—or to simply leave them in the laundry basket. A wardrobe helps organize those extra clothes and frees up space in other areas of the bedroom.</li><li>It can be converted into something else later. Though the best wardrobe will be one that neatly holds clothing, removing the clothing rod or shelves can transform the unit into something different, such as an entertainment center, linen storage, or even a kitchen pantry.</li></ul>",327
401,sheds,"<p>We used several criteria when making our selections of the top sheds on the market, including build quality, aesthetics, and functionality. A shed must be able to hold up to extreme weather and be useful for many years, so we chose only models with durable construction. While wood-frame sheds are inherently strong, we only chose resin sheds with thick walls or steel reinforcement, while the metal sheds we selected were required to have thick-gauge steel construction.</p> <p>Functionality is important, so we favored sheds with large double doors and higher ceilings that provided additional storage as well as those with windows and skylights that provided natural light for visibility. Since sheds take up a noticeable spot on one’s property, we selected models that were attractive when possible, including those with interesting rooflines, appealing colors, and architectural features such as window boxes, cupolas, and eave overhangs.</p>",144
402,christmas tree bag,"<p>We dug into the different Christmas tree bag options, from size to type. Materials played a big role in our choices. Most people need a storage bag that resists both tearing and water, and that comes down to materials. The durability of the handles and seams also factored in when we considered materials. We also considered the quality of the closures. After all, a zipper that pops the first time it’s used won’t protect the tree much.</p> <p>When it comes to types, models that lay flat are more popular. Most of our picks come from this category. However, we included an upright bag and a Christmas tree box because of the many ways trees can be stored.

411,soldering station,"<p>Our list of high quality soldering stations meets the needs and rigors of DIY electronics repairs. We started by calling on our own experience in order to determine the must-have features and settings. Then, we carried out extensive product research in order to find the best soldering stations.</p> <p>Next, we compared power output and temperature. We compared wattages and temperature ranges to ensure we’d be suggesting something for everyone, from the casual solderer who might be working with a DIY kit to an expert who bouncing from joint to joint. Finally, we compared prices in order to suggest something for every budget without sacrificing quality.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Soldering Station</h2> <p>When it comes to soldered joints, oxidation—a form of corrosion between the soldering iron’s tip and oxygen, accelerated by heat—is the issue. To help combat oxidation, soldering pros use flux: a chemical cleaning agent that helps prevent oxidation and promotes the flow of solder, allowing the solder to attach itself more easily to the joint. Your best bet: use hollow soldering wire with a rosin core; rosin helps the solder flow and reduces the effects of oxidation.</p> <p>Soldering creates fumes and smoke. While most smaller jobs don’t create an actual health hazard, the fumes can give users a sore throat and possibly a headache, so always ventilate the areas when soldering. Open a window and use a fan to extract the irritants from the room, and consider wearing an N95 mask and other protective gear.</p> <p>When soldering a wire onto a control board, one pro move is to pre-tin the tip of the wire. Simply melt a bit of solder onto the wire end before soldering it to the board. This ensures an oxidation-free wire tip, and it allows the solder to attach faster to finish with a far more reliable result.</p> <ul><li>Use a rosin-core solder to help minimize oxidation.</li><li>Keep the area well-ventilated or wear a mask to avoid fumes.</li><li>Pre-tin wire ends before soldering to a control board for the best results.</li></ul>",333

Finally, a good pocket jig should last a long time, so we chose durably constructed models that will hold up to repeated use.</p>",130
414,corded drill,"<p>We researched the most sought-after corded drills in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their speed, chuck size, weight, compatibility with multiple surfaces, and other special features included with the top power tool brands.</p> <p>Between impact drivers, hammer drills, and traditional drills, the most popular options among users were ones with a ⅜-inch chuck for their versatility, while the ones with a ½-inch chuck offered ample durability. Many of the above models also offer ample speed, ranging from 950 to 3,000 rpms for ample torque. To reduce fatigue on your hands and wrists, the picks are lightweight and some have side handles for maximum control.</p> <p>As for special additions and safety features, many of the drills include variable speed triggers, lock-on buttons, two-finger pressure-sensitive triggers, accessories and drill bits, multiple speed settings, and vacuums for cleaning dust and debris from your workshop.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Corded Drill</h2> <p>Corded drills offer a host of benefits that make it a valuable tool in the home or workshop power tool arsenal. With access to 110 volts of electricity, corded drills feature powerful motors that generate significantly more torque and speed than their cordless counterparts.</p> <p>As such, they are well-suited for heavy-duty drilling jobs. This includes tasks between cutting through a sheet of plywood wood with a 2-inch hole saw to drilling through sheet metal and steel.</p> <p>Corded drills also have the advantage of a limitless supply of power (as long as it’s plugged in). There’s no waiting for that little red light on the battery charger to turn green with a corded drill, allowing you to continue with the job. Corded drills also won’t require an expensive lithium battery replacement after a few years of use.</p> <p>Since corded drills don’t carry their power source with them, they are also lighter than cordless drills, reducing user fatigue and making them easier to handle.</p> <ul><li>Corded drills offer more power than a cordless drill.</li><li>Corded drills have a limitless energy supply and don’t require an expensive battery replacement.</li><li>Corded drills are lighter than cordless drills.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using a Corded Drill</h2> <p>As with any power tool, there is an inherent risk in using a corded drill. Wear safety glasses when operating this power tool and always unplug the drill before changing bits.</p> <p>It’s also crucial to understand the differences in drill bit shanks, which can be round or have flat sides. While round drill bits are easier to install correctly, they are prone to spinning in the chuck. Drill bits with flat shanks will not turn but can be hard to install, negatively impacting drilling performance. Proper bit installation and chuck tightening are essential for a corded drill to work correctly.</p> <p>With great power comes great responsibility. Such is the case with a corded drill. Manage the power of your drill wisely. While you may be tempted to use the drill’s maximum capacity, that strategy won’t work with some harder materials, such as metal and concrete. Sometimes using a slower speed to achieve higher torque yields better results.</p> <ul><li>Wear eyewear when operating a corded drill and unplug the drill when changing bits.</li><li>Be familiar with the proper installation of round and flat-sided drill bits.</li><li>Use the power of a corded drill wisely.</li></ul>",540

416,jointer,"<p>In researching more than a dozen different jointers, we considered a variety of factors. A good jointer should have a motor that spins the blade fast enough to make smooth cuts. With that in mind, we stuck with jointers that reach a max speed of at least 10,000 rpms. Jointers are typically used to plane larger pieces of wood, so table length is important. For that reason, we leaned toward tables that were long enough to support longer workpieces.</p> <p>In addition to a long table, a good jointer should also have a fence that easily adjusts to cut at different angles. Finally, since jointers create precision cuts, it’s crucial that they be made from sturdy materials such as cast iron that won’t warp or bend over time.</p>",127
417,framing nailer,"<p>There’s a lot riding on a list of the best framing nailers, so we knew we had to take the job seriously. The first step was to draw upon all of our experience working with these tools so we knew which features were must-haves. Next, we collected tools from all of the top brands in the framing nailer field for review.</p> <p>After performing extensive product research, we were able to narrow our group of framing nailers down a bit, discarding the models that didn’t have the features we felt were necessary. Finally, after taking price and value into consideration, we were able to put together a list of the best framing nailers and give each an award.</p> <h2>Safety Tips for Using a Framing Nailer</h2> <p>An accident with or misuse of a framing nailer could cause major, or even fatal, injury. The following safety practices are crucial to avoid harming anyone:</p> <ul><li>Treat this framing nailer as a firearm and never point it at anyone, even when it’s disconnected from its power source.</li><li>When clearing a jammed nail, always disconnect the power source from the framing nailer first.</li><li>Framing nailers produce a lot of power, which can cause both debris and the nail itself to unpredictably fly out in all directions. Wear safety goggles. To prevent potential hearing loss, it’s also a good idea to wear ear protection during prolonged use.</li><li>Be aware of others around the site, and avoid using the nailer if someone is in close proximity, as there’s always the potential for a nailer to misfire or fire through the material.</li><li>When carrying the nail gun, users should keep the tip facing away from their body and make certain their fingers are not placed over the trigger to avoid accidental firing.</li></ul>",288
418,drill presses,"<p>The right drill press can make cutting your wood or metal quick and safe. The above drill presses come in various types, power outputs, chuck sizes, rpms, and additional special features and safety features for your big or small projects.</p> <p>We researched the most sought-after drill presses in their respective categories and discovered that benchtop options are favored for their ease of use, potential portability, and effective cutting power. Magnetic and floor drill presses are also listed above. While the magnetic is suitable for metal and softwood, the floor models offer more precision.</p> <p>Though different in performance, each of the above presses has powerful rpms ranging from 210 to 3,200.

419,dovetail jig,"<p>Dovetail jigs are something of a staple in old-school woodworking shops, so putting a list together of the top models was no small feat. We had to draw upon our experiences in woodworking and DIY projects to consider the features and capacities we find most helpful just to get started.</p> <p>With a list of the most important features down, we performed extensive product research to find models that we felt might meet our needs. We then compared those products’ quality features, additional items, capacities, and prices to ensure they offered enough value. We tossed out the dovetail jigs that couldn’t cut it, and then gave the models that made it awards based on their strengths.</p> <h2>Shopping for a Used or Refurbished Dovetail Jig</h2> <p>While there are lots of great dovetail jigs on the market to choose from, it might be worth shopping for a used model. Dovetail jigs have been around a long time, and the older models were extremely durable, meaning there are probably quite a few around, and the deals can be worth the effort.</p> <p>Many older dovetail kits featured cast iron construction, making them extremely durable (though a bit heavy). While they may not be adjustable, these jigs are almost sure to be accurate as long as they’re whole (no missing or bent teeth). And older DIYers or retiring woodworkers looking to pass them onto new craftspeople may entertain steep discounts to move these heavy tools.</p> <p>The downside is that these tools aren’t always readily available on sites like Amazon Renew, Ebay Refurbished, or Walmart Refurbished. Due to their weight, they can be cost-prohibitive to ship, though it may be worth checking those sites first, anyway. Local yard sales and swap meets may be a better bet.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Dovetail Jig</h2> <p>If any play or wobble occurs in the jig or workpieces, the results won’t be as accurate. Clamp the jig base securely to the table or the workpiece to ensure the best possible joints.</p> <p>If the boards come from a home improvement store, be sure to square up their ends before placing them in the router jig. Factory ends are rarely square, and routing them in a dovetail jig will create a box that wobbles or doesn’t assemble properly. Consider running them over a jointer to ensure that all of the surfaces are perfectly square. If not, a hand plane will do the trick.</p> <p>Alignment is everything. When clamping the workpiece into the jig, ensure that everything is square and aligned properly. Take your time and make sure that this part of the process is correct. A mistake here can end with a poorly cut joint and two boards that don’t align properly. This step is even more critical when repositioning a jig for a wider board: A small mistake here could keep the joint from coming together at all.</p> <ul><li>For consistent results, be sure the jig or workpiece is clamped securely to the table.</li><li>Square the ends of the boards before milling them on the jig.</li><li>Ensure accurate alignment, especially when repositioning the jig on a wider board.</li></ul>",513

While it’s important to choose products that come from reputable sources, we don’t limit our picks to premium brands. Value-for-money is always a vital part of our thought process.</p> <p>My own experience with Forstner bits is extensive. I was the owner of a woodshop for 11 years; I’ve also renovated two homes. I use Forstner bits for precision furniture-making as well as for punching holes through support beams in preparation for cabling. Some of the best Forstner bits cut like fine chisels, but sometimes speed is more desirable than great accuracy. Durability, edge retention, and price also play a part. In my opinion, the wide range of Forstner bit sets listed above provides a solution for (almost) every demand.</p>",136
424,screwdriver bit set,"<p>The best screwdriver bit sets come with a wide variety of sizes and head types, are made of durable materials to withstand the job at hand, and are kept organized inside a durable carrying case. Our research has helped us come across the top picks for a range of specific uses.

As such, our top picks all include a convenient carry case to ensure drill bits and blades stay organized and are less likely to get lost over time.</p> <p>Our research also found that blade material and available sizes were high on the must-have list, so our suggested products cover a range of durable materials to suit the needs for a variety of projects. These include extremely tough ice-treated materials for heavy use—which comes at a price—down to more affordable options that still handle the job but are perhaps less indestructible in the long run and are best suited for occasional work. Shoppers will also find this list to only include options that offer a wide variety of blade sizes in their kits, since we know that one size certainly does not fit all in this situation.</p> <h2>FAQs About Hole Saw Kits</h2> <p>If you’re still wondering about how hole saws work, then read on for answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about these tools.</p> <h3>Q: Can you use a hole saw without a pilot bit?</h3> <p>You do not have to use a pilot bit with a hole saw; however, it is challenging to center a hole saw without using a pilot bit as a guide.</p> <h3>Q: Will a hole saw cut through stainless steel?</h3> <p>A good bimetal hole saw will cut through hard materials, such as thin-gauge steel and stainless steel.</p> <h3>Q: Can a hole saw cut metal? </h3> <p>A hole saw will cut through thin-gauge metal materials like aluminum and steel. When possible, use oil or water to lubricate the surface to prevent the bit from overheating, which can damage the bit.</p>",297
426,concrete saw,"<p>To determine the best concrete saws on the market, we looked at a variety of factors. First, we assessed how each saw cut, both in the types of materials it cut and in its power and accuracy. Specifically, we looked at how each saw and its blade cleanly cut concrete in different projects. Saws that struggled to cut concrete quickly and accurately were dismissed.</p> <p>A number of consumer-related factors were also assessed. The design of the saw was taken into consideration, as it was important to determine how easily customers could use the saw when cutting concrete. Safety features were evaluated as well to make sure users could easily access them and that they were easy to use. We also looked at the prices for the saws and determined which ones were priced fairly and gave the consumer the most value for their money.</p>",144
427,cordless framing nailer,"<p>Putting together a list of the best cordless nailers was a blast for us. We put all of our years of DIY and construction experience to the test, picking out the features we thought were most important so we knew what shoppers would be looking for.</p> <p>Once we had our list of the most important features, we performed extensive product research to round up nailers for the test. We then compared their prices, power, accessories, and overall value to ensure that we were suggesting only the best models on the market. We threw the products that didn’t make the cut to the side and then gave awards to the ones that made it based on their strengths and the categories shoppers would be most likely to look for.</p> <h2>Shopping for a Used or Refurbished Framing Nailer</h2> <p>Framing nailers can speed up a project tremendously. However, by the time that homeowner or DIYer decides to purchase a pneumatic framing nailer and a compressor large enough to run it, they’ve probably spent more than they would on a cordless nailer. For that reason, even if they only need the nailer for one job, they’ll often opt for a cordless framing nailer and then sell it after the job is done. That means the second-hand market sees its fair share of nailers.</p> <p>Checking sites like Amazon Renewed, eBay Refurbished, and Walmart’s Certified Refurbished Electronics is a smart choice when shopping for cordless framing nail guns. These models are used and restored, allowing users to save quite a bit of money over purchasing a new nailer.</p> <p>For those purchasing their cordless nailer directly from a private seller, be sure that the cordless framing nailer works properly. Also, they should expect to have to purchase a new battery relatively soon, so it’s best to negotiate the price to cover the cost.</p>",306
428,cordless brad nailer,"<p>I have remodeled two homes and have owned a couple of brad nailers. The first brad nailer taught me how frustrating frequent jams can be. The second, a high-quality tool, rose to the occasion. To support my own experience, the Bob Vila team researched recent models from manufacturers of battery-powered nailers to ensure we had up-to-date technical information.</p> <p>Each of these cordless tools fires the necessary sizes of brads or staples, so major differences lie in other features of the tools. The number of brads per charge is one key figure, but comparisons prove difficult. For example, one manufacturer may supply a 1.5Ah battery, while another offers a 2Ah. Several manufacturers don’t provide figures. Brushless motors also affect battery life. Practically maintenance-free, they last longer and make better use of energy but come at a higher price.</p> <p>We have tried to offer a broad selection. We chose models that showcase the wide variety available and, in doing so, hope to provide solutions for both DIY and professional users on all budgets.</p>",171
429,sander for furniture,"<p>Our recommendations for the best sanders for furniture come from a number of well-known brands that have a great track record for power tools. We selected products that have a variety of dust collection methods, variable speed adjustments, and rotation or orbital movement. Some are better suited for fine sanding and polishing, while others are best for heavy-duty sanding to power through the toughest surfaces. These variations are important for users who know that no two sanding projects are the same.</p> <p>We further narrowed our research by products that have the standard round sanding surface that uses traditional hook-and-loop sanding pads and products with a pointed end that reaches farther into tight spaces. In short, there’s a sanding pad for everyone on this list (at a number of price points), which makes it a truly comprehensive collection of the best sanders for furniture.</p>",143
430,dowel jig,"<p>When gathering our top recommendations for dowel jigs, we made sure to include a range of options depending on both intended use and price. To suit beginner DIYers, we have a wide selection of price-friendly options to choose from that are capable of the three most common doweling sizes (1/4 inch, 5/16 inch, and 3/8 inch). Pros are not left out in this list either. We researched high-end models built from top-quality materials that are made to last a lifetime. Features such as laser engraving for durability and ease of use, as well as precision engineered joining systems can help more experienced users produce better results.</p> <p>We also made sure to include options with self centering capabilities, as well as a pick suitable for cylindrical shapes. No matter what type of dowel jig you’re shopping for, our list of options offers the best the market has to offer in their respective categories.</p>",152
431,rotary laser levels,"<p>I have been involved with several extensive house remodeling projects, so I have hands-on experience with laser levels and measuring devices. While I have never used a rotary version, I understand the technology and was interested to see the various ways in which it was implemented. Our team also conducted extensive product research to make sure we were aware of the latest developments.</p> <p>We looked at the various performance aspects mentioned above, and because these devices often are used in harsh environments, we also noted IP ratings and physical protection.</p> <p>Brand reputation and value for money always rank high. Johnson, Spectra Precision, Topcon, and Bosch are leaders in the field, with excellent reputations for precision and durability. However, big names often come with premium prices. We also considered less well-known manufacturers who offered equipment that met our quality and performance expectations.</p>",141
432,plate compactors,"<p>I have been involved in two extensive house renovations, so while not a full-time professional I do have hands-on experience using a plate compactor. To support my own knowledge, the Bob Vila team conducted extensive research to make sure we were aware of recent developments.</p> <p>While performance is always a key issue, we were keen to look at models from across the full range of capabilities, not just high-end equipment. The result is a selection that should appeal to home users as well as landscaping and construction professionals.</p> <p>Although some of the brands chosen may not be widely known, most have a significant market presence and a reputation for durability and reliability. Price was also a factor, and we sought to select machines that offer good value even when the investment is considerable. However, we did stop short of full-on professional machinery that can easily exceed $10,000.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Plate Compactors</h2> <p>Plate compactors need not be difficult to use, but a few tips will help ensure safety and help produce the desired results.</p> <ul><li>Read the manual thoroughly so that you understand how the plate compactor operates and how to stop it quickly if necessary.</li><li>Wear ear protection, safety glasses or goggles, gloves, and strong boots during use.</li><li>Take a firm grip when starting the machine. Start on a level surface if practical to prevent it from wandering. Try a small test area to get accustomed to the handling.</li><li>Work from one corner, up and down in straight lines. Then go back to the start and work back and forwards across the area at 90 degrees to the original direction.</li></ul>",267
433,husqvarna chainsaws,"<p>In creating our list of the top Husqvarna chainsaws, we included a broad range of models to suit everything from light-duty pruning and trimming up to professional-level tree cutting. When possible, we chose models that incorporate the most useful Husqvarna options, including anti-vibration and easy-start features, as well as maintenance technologies like auto-oilers and side-mounted chain tensioners. Although Husqvarna makes predominantly gas-powered chainsaws, we also included one of its electric chainsaws for those who like the convenience of electric-powered power tools. Engine power was important, so we chose models that produce enough torque to power their respective bar lengths.</p> <h2>Tips on How to Use a Husqvarna Chainsaw</h2> <p>There are a few tips to keep in mind to make working with a Husqvarna chainsaw easier and safer. First and foremost, understand your limits. If you don’t feel comfortable with the chainsaw in your hands or if the task feels too big, then consider calling a professional. Before getting started, check to make sure the chain is properly lubricated and has the correct amount of tension. While working, be mindful of the potential for kickback. Hold the chainsaw firmly in both hands and make sure the tip of the chainsaw does not come into contact with any objects. When making cuts, keep the chainsaw steady and don’t cut anything that is above shoulder height to reduce the risk of injury. Finally, always use protective equipment, which includes a helmet, eye protection, hearing protection, and chainsaw chaps.</p> <ul><li>Make sure you feel comfortable with the chainsaw and the job.</li><li>Properly lubricate the chain and adjust the chain tension.</li><li>Hold the chainsaw firmly in both hands while cutting.</li><li>Never cut anything above shoulder height.</li><li>Use the necessary safety equipment.</li></ul>",280
434,construction work pants,"<p>When we challenged ourselves to come up with a guide to the best construction work pants, we knew there’d be a lot of work to do.</p> <p>First, we started by calling on our experiences as DIYers and tradespeople. This allowed us to choose the features that a pair of construction pants might need to make the cut. Next, we performed extensive product research on the brands we know and trust, compiling a list of products that offered the features we needed. Finally, we compared materials and prices to ensure we were suggesting value-minded products.</p> <p>With all of those boxes checked, we were able to put together a list of the best construction work pants to ease the shopping and selection process for DIYers and pros.</p>",125
435,chainsaw sharpener,"<p>Proper chainsaw sharpening tools are key when it comes to chainsaw maintenance. It’s not only important for easier tree felling, but also for woodland management. Fortunately, today’s tools make sharpening chainsaws a breeze by coming in multiple designs, being easy-to-use, and are compatible with multiple chainsaw sizes.</p> <p>The above chainsaw sharpeners come in manual, automatic, and electric designs. Though the electric sharpeners provide ease of use, adjustability, and ease of use during the sharpening process, many of them require mounting which can be difficult for some users. Alternatively, automatic and manual sharpeners may require more work and strain, but are portable and easy to bring to a job site.</p> <p>Many of the above picks also have adjustable pitches and angles to sharpen chainsaws of multiple sizes. Whether you are a weekend user building your firewood stack or a full-time professional, there’s a chainsaw sharpener for all needs and every budget.</p> <h2>Tips on Using a Chainsaw Sharpener</h2> <p>Proper chainsaw sharpening is very important. Not only does it make cutting easier, it’s also safer. Blunt chainsaw teeth are more likely to bind in a cut. It can be extremely difficult to remove and could ruin the chain. There’s also a much greater chance that the chain jumps off the bar, which could lead to serious injury.</p> <p>How to sharpen a chainsaw is covered in a separate article, but see the main points listed just below. Whichever type of chainsaw sharpener you use, preparation and patience are key. Poor setup guarantees a poor result.</p> <ul><li>Wear work gloves. Parts of the chain can still hurt your hands even when it’s blunt.</li><li>When sharpening with the chain off of the saw, make sure the chainsaw sharpener is solidly fixed to a bench or wall. Movement will affect the accuracy of sharpening.</li><li>When sharpening with the chain on the saw, make sure the chain is properly tensioned to minimize movement. Also keep the saw as stable as possible by holding the bar in a vise or having some kind of backstop. It can be a challenge when working in the field. A tailgate vise or a portable workbench can be an effective solution.</li><li>Most chains have a “master cutter”—a tooth that’s shorter than the others. Start sharpening here, so you know you’re done when you come back around to it. If you can’t find a master, mark the chain with a piece of tape.</li><li>Work slowly and carefully. Even manual sharpening with a simple chainsaw file only takes a few minutes, so there’s no need to rush. If using a manual sharpener, work on the forward stroke only. Don’t rub the file back and forth.</li></ul>",435
436,pin nailers,"<p>Choosing the best pin nailers took a lot of work. We had to call upon all of our experience in DIY projects, woodworking, and finish carpentry to choose the features we thought we’d need most.</p> <p>With the important features nailed down, we conducted extensive product research to compile a list of tools we felt might meet our needs. Once we had our list, we compared the features and the pros and cons, as well as the prices, to ensure they would get the job done while providing enough value.</p> <p>We tossed to the side the pin nailers that didn’t make it and focused on the models that did. We gave each tool an award based on its strengths, creating this list of the best pin nailers.</p>",126
437,jointer planer combos,"<p>I am an engineer by profession, and for 10 years ran my own woodshop. I understand how these machines work and have hands-on experience. To support my own knowledge, the Bob Vila team researched leading manufacturers and the current lineup.</p> <p>The range of high-quality jointer planer combos available in the U.S. is somewhat limited, so it was a question of finding appropriate solutions for as diverse a group of users as possible.</p> <p>Each of the top picks comes from a brand with a reputation for durability and reliability. We have also selected models that represent the best jointer planer combo in each of the popular sizes and are offered at a range of prices to suit most everyone from the home woodworker to the professional.</p>",125
438,portable air compressor,"<p>Because we are experienced builders and DIYers, portable air compressors are sort of our bread and butter. And putting this guide together relied heavily on our experience, allowing us to choose the features we felt mattered the most for these tools. It also took extensive product research to make this list happen.</p> <p>First, we collected the portable air compressor options available from all of our favorite brands. Then, we split them by size and power source. Next, we compared the features and power to make sure that these models could do the trick. Finally, we compared price versus value so fellow builders and DIYers would know exactly what they were getting for the price. The result is our list of the best portable air compressors.</p>",125
439,sawhorse,"<p>We carried out considerable research to ensure we were aware of all the latest developments in sawhorses. We used the following criteria to make our selections.</p> <ul><li>Fit for purpose: The capacity, or amount of weight a sawhorse supports, often headlines the product specs. While few people ever need to support 1,000 pounds plus, it does give an idea of the structural integrity and often indicates good durability. However, it’s more important that the sawhorse is appropriate for the task expected of it. Low cost, lightweight models are just as valid for some users as heavy-duty monsters. We’ve tried to ensure that there are choices for everyone among our selections.</li><li>Portability: Sawhorses get moved around frequently—often from home to the job site. Whether fixed or folding, this was a key feature in our decision-making.</li><li>Brand and value: Big name brands have often built a reputation for quality that makes them hard to ignore. However, they frequently come at premium prices. We looked at models across the price range in order to find reliable equipment for all budgets.</li></ul> <h2>Tips for Using a Sawhorse</h2> <p>Stability ranks as the most important feature of a sawhorse, particularly with long material or large sheets. Unsteady sawhorses are a safety risk.</p> <ul><li>Always make sure the ground is firm and the sawhorses are spaced to provide adequate support.</li><li>If you put a little sideways pressure on the material that is resting on the sawhorses and they rock, reposition them so that doesn’t happen. Same if the material is sagging; find a good balance point.</li><li>Material may hide the sawhorses, so make sure you know where you are cutting or you could damage the sawhorses or the saw blade. Some people fix sacrificial 2×4 or 2×6 wooden strips to the top of the sawhorses depending on what the sawhorses are made of. These may be thrown away if damaged.</li><li>Using a couple of 2x4s fixed along the edges of a sheet of plywood turns sawhorses into a temporary workbench. It may also be possible to make a shelf to fit between the legs (if not already provided), which gives workers somewhere handy to rest tools while working.</li><li>Consider drilling a hole big enough for a carabiner or cord hooks to keep your power tool cords off the ground.</li><li>Sawhorses also make effective barriers to keep people away from a work area.</li></ul>",385
440,hammer drill,"<p>There are many hammer drill models on the market, and manufacturers are regularly updating their products to incorporate the latest advancements in the industry. This means that even a single manufacturer will typically have several different hammer drill models to choose from. With this in mind, it was necessary to extensively research over 30 products to put together this list of the best hammer drills.</p> <p>To sift through the selection of products, we considered the power source, the various modes of operation, and the power output as indicated by the voltage, amperage, and top speed. Also, any products that included additional features, like a carrying bag, an accessory kit, or a removable auxiliary handle, were preferred over similar products that lacked these extra features.</p> <h2>Our Top Picks</h2> <p>Both DIYers and professionals consider these hammer drills the best in their classes based on functionality, cost, and design.</p> <article><header><h4>Best Corded<div></div></h4><div><div>1</div><h3>  Tacklife 1/2-Inch Electric Hammer Drill </h3></div></header> <div><div><noscript></noscript></div></div> <div>Photo: walmart.com</div><div> Check Latest Price</div><section><p> Built for power and versatility, the Tacklife ½-Inch Electric Hammer Drill has a variable speed dial and trigger for maximum user control.

The cordless hammer drill makes light work of drilling into tough materials like masonry. The impact driver effortlessly deals with oversize fasteners like deck screws that can sap the energy from even the most powerful standard drill/driver.</p><p>When the DeWalt hammer drill is used on concrete it offers impressive torque and power. It can drill a half a dozen holes without the hammer drill bogging down or the battery lagging. With this power, beware of your hands and wrists giving out before the hammer drill drains its 20-volt 4 amp-hour battery, as it can keep going and going. One slight downside is that the included leverage bar is made from relatively lightweight plastic—it’s durable but may feel cheap.</p><p>The impact driver comes with a compact nose and three speed adjustments. In my personal use of this tool, I was able to insert screws into soft pine wood without the impact motion kicking in. However, when adding pressure and inserting screws into ash wood, the impact motion kicked in and added power to insert the screws more quickly. The impact is smooth and rapid, similar to a well-oiled machine. All in all, it’s an excellent set for the money.</p><p>The drill has a ½-inch chuck with a durable, all-metal 11-position clutch.

First, decide whether you prefer a battery-powered or a corded model, then look for one with a variable speed trigger for better control. Even a regular drill will typically have a variable speed trigger, so the next thing to think about is the various modes of operation. The best hammer drills can be used for hammer drilling through masonry material, drilling through softer material (like wood) and driving screws. Just make sure you have the correct drill bits for the job.</p> <h3>Corded vs. Cordless</h3> <p>Hammer drills come with one of two power source options: either a heavy-duty cord or a rechargeable battery. Corded hammer drills provide a constant source of power and also tend to be somewhat more powerful than battery-operated models—two aspects that make them more effective and dependable for long days on a busy job site. They can be plugged into an extension cord if needed for a longer reach, but corded hammer drills are ultimately tethered to a nearby source of electricity.</p> <p>Conversely, a cordless hammer drill is bound to run out of juice after several hours of use, but these models do have their strong points. They’re generally lighter, smaller, and easier to maneuver than their corded counterparts (plus there’s no chance of tripping over that pesky power cord). Cordless models tend to be more popular with DIYers, who appreciate their portability and versatility for projects around the house.</p> <h3>Variable Speed</h3> <p>Different jobs often require a drill to run at faster or slower speeds to improve accuracy and penetration, while avoiding any damage to the drill itself. A good hammer drill will feature either a variable-speed setting dial or a trigger control that lets you adjust the operating speed. To determine if a drill has a variable-speed setting, look for a dial that shows the numbers from 1 to 2, or sometimes 1 to 3, with 1 being the lowest setting.</p> <p>A trigger control, which responds to the amount of pressure you apply, offers a greater degree of speed control. Some prefer this personalized control, while others want a drill to operate at the same speed all the time. A trigger control tends to be most beneficial when the user doesn’t have a free hand to adjust the speed—one reason trigger controls are preferred by professionals.</p> <h3>Hammer Mode</h3> <p>The hammer mode is a setting on all hammer drills that’s commonly marked by a symbol depicting a hammer. This mode introduces a pulsating action that helps drive masonry bits through hard materials, such as concrete, brick, and stone.</p> <p>In addition to the increased hammering force, the drill maintains its rotational capabilities to drill and punch through hard material, similar to combining an auger and a jackhammer, though to a lesser degree. Rotary hammer drills are specifically made for long periods of tough jack-hammering through mortar, brick, and stone.</p> <h3>Drill Mode</h3> <p>Hammer drills commonly have a button that allows the user to switch between the hammer mode and normal operation. This is generally referred to as drill mode and may be marked only by a variable-speed setting ranging from 1 to 3.</p> <p>Alternatively, it may be marked by a symbol that resembles a drill bit, depending on the model. This mode has more controlled torque and is intended for drilling holes through softer materials, such as wood or plastic.</p> <h3>Drive Mode</h3> <p>Some hammer drills (as well as regular drills) feature a setting called a drive mode, which is used for driving and removing screws. Drive mode eliminates the pulsating force of the hammer setting and instead engages the torque-adjustment setting for precision work like driving screws into a deck.</p> <p>This low-power setting helps ensure that the torque of the drill won’t strip the screws. A hammer drill with drive mode will often show a symbol that resembles a screw on the mode-control switch.</p> <h3>Additional Features</h3> <p>Higher-end hammer drills may offer extra features that can help the user complete a project faster or add a touch of comfort or functionality. These options can include a 360-degree auxiliary handle, a built-in flashlight, a depth gauge, a brushless motor, a carrying case, or a spare battery.</p> <ul><li>360-degree auxiliary handle for the best grip possible in complex or enclosed spaces.</li><li>Built-in flashlight to help users see what they are doing without needing to hold a separate light source.</li><li>Depth gauge to determine how deep a hole has been drilled. This simple tool just needs to be inserted into the hole and the reading on the edge of the gauge will indicate the depth of the hole.</li><li>Brushless motors, as the name implies, do not have brushes inside the motor to reverse the polarity of the electromagnet. Instead, the motor has a different configuration that allows it to reduce the heat produced by the drill while increasing the life of the tool.</li><li>Carrying cases are effective for carrying the hammer drill when it’s not in use and are also used for simple storage.</li><li>Spare batteries may not be necessary for corded hammer drills, but it’s always good to have a backup battery on hand when you are working with a cordless hammer drill.</li></ul>",2578
441,table saw,"<p>Within our team of writers, one of us is a former woodshop owner and one is a general contractor; therefore, we have extensive experience using table saws of different sizes. We understand the requirements of users and how various models provide for them. In addition, our team researched all the current tools available, so we were aware of the latest developments.</p> <p>For the updates to this test, we ran 2-by pressure-treated lumber; 1×8 finger-jointed primed pine; plywood; and composite decking through each saw looking for everything from power and vibration to dust ejection and vibration. We evaluated adjustments, switches, and fence smoothness along the rails. We also considered mobility and storage.</p> <h3>Capacities</h3> <p>While depth of cut is important, most table saws are 10-inch models and specifications are very similar. While their primary function in home workshops and on jobsites is ripping dimensional lumber—which doesn’t require a huge rip capacity—ripping capacity varies tremendously and is a key feature for those who cut large sheet material. We were careful to source solutions for all types of users.</p> <h3>Size and Portability</h3> <p>For many users, a compact, portable table saw is the ideal solution. For others, physical size is less important than capacity and stability. We made sure to include a comprehensive selection to cover those who work with these saws on-site or in small spaces at home as well as those who have a large workshop available.</p> <h3>Brand and Value</h3> <p>We avoid cheap table saws, which are often poor in terms of durability and reliability. While buying from the leading table saw brands can mean you pay a little more, this almost always results in better long-term value.</p> <h2>Tips for Using and Maintaining Your Table Saw</h2> <p>Owners will doubtless spend many hours learning how to get the best from their table saw. The following quick tips provide a useful place to start:</p> <ul><li>Read the manual carefully even if you have owned a table saw before; there will often be differences. It’s important to understand the safety features and know how to maximize performance.</li><li>By law, all table saws must have a blade guard. Never operate the saw without it in place. The riving knife should only be removed if using a dado blade.</li><li>Always wear eye protection. Ear defenders are also a good idea.</li><li>Check the blade for damage before each work session. If there is a crack, missing teeth, or unexpected vibration, replace the blade immediately.</li><li>There’s an old woodworking adage that you should measure twice and cut once. This can also apply to setting up a table saw. Adjust and then check before making each cut.</li><li>Clean the table saw after use. Disconnect the power first, then use an ordinary nylon-bristle hand brush or cordless blower.</li><li>Learning how to make featherboards, push sticks, and table saw jigs can improve safety, speed, and accuracy, particularly with repetitive tasks. It’s also very rewarding to make things yourself rather than buying them.</li><li>Blade choice can have a dramatic impact on performance, even if the diameter remains the same. You can read more about the best table saw blades in a separate article.</li></ul>",511
442,heat gun,"<p>Over 30 different heat gun products were considered for selection and only through extensive research into each product was it possible to put together this list of the best heat guns. The most important factors that were taken into consideration included the temperature controls, the type of heat gun, the temperature range, fan speed settings, and any nozzles or accessories that could improve the versatility of the tool.</p> <p>Products that came with built-in safety features, like a nozzle safety shield, or premium features, like built-in memory settings, typically stood out from competitors as long as other important factors were relatively constant. Quality heat gun kits that came bundled with multiple nozzles, accessories, and a carrying case, were also highly rated.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Heat Gun </h2> <p>Heat guns are dangerous power tools that can just as easily peel wallpaper as they can burn your skin and hair, so it’s important to always dress appropriately and wear personal protective equipment. Long sleeve shirts, long pants, and closed-toe shoes are recommended, as well as safety gloves, safety glasses, and a mask to help avoid breathing in chemicals while you work.</p> <p>You should also make sure to work in a well-ventilated space because the chemical smell produced by stripping paint or melting the glue on wallpaper can be harmful if inhaled. It can also cause eye irritation, which is why protective glasses or goggles are a good choice.</p> <p>To avoid damaging the material or burning anything, start the heat gun further away from the target material and slowly bring it closer until it can melt glue, loosen paint, or heat shrink plastic.</p> <ul><li>Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment.</li><li>Operate a heat gun in a well-ventilated space.</li><li>Start further away from the target material and gradually bring the heat gun closer.</li></ul>",295
443,socket set,"<p>Before attempting to select the top socket sets, it was important to research and review each individual product from over 30 possible choices. This extensive research helped us determine the products that stood out based on the number of pieces in the set, finish, drive size, versatility, and any special features that made a product stand out from similar options.</p> <p>When examining the number of pieces in a set, a key consideration was the quality or value of each piece. Some sets were dropped from the selection because they had a large number of miscellaneous parts and a small number of actual sockets. The chrome or black oxide finish was used to help differentiate the regular sockets from impact sockets, while ⅜ inch was the most important drive size for a set to have due to the commonality of this size.</p> <p>However, if a socket set had more than one drive size or if it had a variety of sockets, including SAE, metric, shallow, or deep sockets, then these factors counted toward overall versatility. The last component of the selection process was the special features or accessories. Socket sets with specialized tools or parts were typically preferred over similar products that lacked these accessories.</p>",204
444,drill bit sharpener,"<p>These recommendations have a range of capabilities to sharpen drill bits of varying sizes. Some drill bit sharpeners can accommodate bits as small as ³⁄₃₂ of an inch or as large as 1½ inches. Since users have unique needs, this list includes sharpeners that offer a solution for almost every commonly used drill bit.</p> <p>We narrowed our research to include drill bit sharpeners that have only a select number of angles to drill at or a range of adjustable angles—though the extra adjustments can make it tricky to operate as well. Each selection on our list has online videos that can be used to help users learn how to properly use the sharpener. Finally, we included recommendations that had a number of different price points and levels of professional quality for both hobbyists and professionals.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Drill Bit Sharpener</h2> <p>If you’re continually working in your shop or on a job site, having your own drill bit sharpener can save you quite a bit of money. Instead of throwing your old bits out, you can grind a new edge on the spot, or place them to the side and spend an hour grinding a whole set until they’re like new.</p> <p>Sharp bits drill faster and more accurately. When the tip of a drill bit becomes dull, it won’t dig in exactly where you’d like it and will also drill crooked or elongated holes. A sharp bit will bore straight down and create a perfectly round hole in almost any material. Having your own drill bit sharpener will allow you to keep your bits in top condition.</p> <p>Drill bit sharpeners can make using drill bits safer. If you’re drilling with a dull bit, you’ll have to use more force to make any progress. A smaller bit can easily snap under pressure, which sometimes sends pieces of drill bit flying. While you should always wear safety glasses, flying bits of metal are never safe. A sharpener will help ensure that you don’t need to put much power behind the bit.</p> <ul><li>Having your own drill bit sharpener will save you money on new bits.</li><li>Sharpening your bits makes them more accurate.</li><li>Keeping your bits sharp makes them safer.</li></ul>",366
445,cordless hammer drill,"<p>We researched the most sought-after cordless hammer drills in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their power output and speed, motor type, battery type, weight, and other special features included by top tool brands.</p> <p>Ranging from 1,450 to 2,250 rpms, the above brushed and brushless options deliver enough speed and power for DIY projects to heavy-duty construction. When searching for the best cordless hammer drills on the market, the most popular type of batteries among users was lithium-ion for its long-lasting lifespan and durability. What’s more, the above picks are also lightweight and don’t cause fatigue if used for long periods of time.</p> <p>For convenience, some of the special features included in the above models include pistol-style grips, side handles, battery fuel gauges, LED lights, multiple operating speeds and chuck settings, and ½-inch keyless ratcheting chucks and auto spindle locks for easy bit changing.</p>",150
446,oscillating tool,"<p>When gathering our list of recommendations for oscillating tools, we looked at the top brands to find out where they stand across a range of categories. We made sure to provide options for shoppers looking for certain selling points, from highly versatile tools with a wide range of accessories to models better suited to particular jobs such as sanding or cutting.</p> <p>We also made sure to include a cordless option for users who prefer to avoid tools that need to be close to an outlet. All our top picks also feature impressive motors, ranging from 2 amps up to a whopping 5 amps to handle all kinds of heavy-duty projects.</p> <h2>Tips for Using an Oscillating Tool</h2> <p>When cutting door or baseboard trim for new flooring, use a piece of scrap flooring as a guide. Lay the scrap piece of flooring on the subfloor and rest the blade flat on its surface. If you keep the blade in contact with this scrap piece as you cut the trim, you’ll end up with a section of perfectly scribed baseboard for your new floor to fit under.</p> <p>If you’re cutting a dowel or nail flush but don’t want to mar a finished work surface with the vibrating blade, you can fashion a guard from a piece of tissue box. Simply cut a slot or hole to fit around the piece you’re cutting and rest the blade on it as you cut.</p> <p>To get the most usable life out of your blades and minimize the noise and vibrations you’ll have to deal with, regulate your speed. Set the oscillating tool at a low setting, and work your way up until the blade is cutting well without burning the material or dulling the blade.</p> <ul><li>Use scrap flooring as a guide when cutting your baseboard and door trim for a new floor.</li><li>Fashion a blade guard from thin cardboard to prevent scratching a finished work surface.</li><li>Regulate your speed to reduce blade wear, noise, and vibration.</li></ul>",328
447,hand saw,"<p>We researched the most sought-after hand saws in their respective categories and discovered that the best models are determined by their type, number of teeth, length, handle type, compatibility with multiple materials, and other special features included by select brands.</p> <p>The above picks feature jab, panel, and hacksaw constructions that are capable of tackling light to heavy-duty jobs. The majority of our picks are made with ample teeth for more cutting power per pass, with options ranging from 8 to 24 PTI. For even more power per swipe of the blade, these hand saws come with 6 to 17-inch lengths based on your intended use.</p> <p>With these factors in mind, our selected picks also come with rubberized or non-slip gripped handles for ease of use and safety, while others are made with induction-heated blades for long-lasting durability. With these factors in mind, the above saws are capable of cutting through wood, metal, plastic, drywall, and more.</p>",156
448,work boots for men,"<p>The right work boots can make your outdoor chores at home, work on the construction site, or hunting activities a more comfortable experience. Selections for the best work boots for men depended upon durability and materials used, size options, safety features, and comfort level.</p> <p>Each of the above products is made with a durable construction of full-grain leather, polyurethane-coated leather, rubber, and textile. With these materials also comes added safety, making them puncture-proof, waterproof, slip-resistant, heat-resistant, and electrical hazard protected. Some of these picks are also made to resist compression, leaving room for your favorite winter socks.</p> <p>For added versatility, many of these boots also come in ample size options and even include wide sizes. Though it is not the most important factor when it comes to work boots, these picks also take comfort into account with layered and cushioned insoles, uppers for ankle support, breathability, odor and moisture control, and even insulation for warmth in the colder months. But, some of these products may require pairing with work jeans or thick socks for added comfort, warmth, and safety.</p>",179
449,benchtop jointer,"<p>Benchtop joints are one of the foundations to a good woodworking project, so putting together a list of the best was a challenge. First, we drew on all of our experience with woodworking and DIY projects to determine the features and abilities we thought were most important for a benchtop jointer.</p> <p>Once we knew what to look for, we performed extensive product research and came up with a pool of potential candidates. Then, we compared additional features, safety items, power, and price to determine which models truly met our criteria. We threw out those that didn’t, and the ones that did received awards based on their strengths.</p> <h2>Shopping for a Used or Refurbished Benchtop Jointer</h2> <p>There’s potential to find a benchtop jointer on the reused market. Many budding woodworkers get into the craft and then find it isn’t for them, allowing DIYers to pick up expensive tools at budget prices.</p> <p>Be sure to check places like Amazon Renew or Ebay Refurbished for benchtop jointers. While they might be expensive to ship, it may be possible to find a deal. It may also be possible to find them at estate sales, yard sales, or flea markets.</p> <p>When shopping for a used benchtop jointer in person, be sure to fire it up and listen for any loud noises or vibration. Also, make sure the bed adjusts smoothly, or it may be impossible to mill certain boards flat. It’s also worth performing a quick search using the product number to ensure the blades are still available for that particular model, else it could be worthless down the road if a blade is too far gone.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Benchtop Jointer</h2> <p>Because jointers don’t cut all the way through a workpiece, it can be hard to tell where the blade is while using one. For that reason, it’s important to keep palms and fingers away from the end of the board. The blade can sneak up quickly, causing serious injury. To reduce the risk even more, use push paddles and a push stick.</p> <p>The blade guard might seem like an inconvenience, but it’s absolutely key for workshop safety. Running thin pieces over a jointer can expose hands to several inches of spinning blades. The blade guard helps reduce this risk, so be sure that it’s operating properly, and don’t remove it.</p> <p>Personal protective equipment is essential. Jointers cut with incredible speed and have the potential to send tiny knots or chips flying, so be sure to wear safety glasses. Also, even the quietest helical jointers are very loud. Be sure to wear ear protection while milling stock or using power tools of any type.</p> <ul><li>Use push paddles and push sticks to keep fingers and hands away from the spinning blade.</li><li>Be sure that the blade guard is working properly.</li><li>Wear eye and ear protection.</li></ul>",468
450,biscuit joiner,"<p>For woodworking or at-home projects, biscuit joiners offer precise and strong joints, cuts, and flat surfaces with minimal effort. Selecting the best biscuit joiners on the market depended on power output, adjustability, added attachments and accessories, and ease of use.</p> <p>Our top picks come with powerful motors of 5.6 to 7 amps for between 10,000 and 11,000 rpm. This power output is aided by adjustable angles and depths for quick and clean cutting. Many of these above picks have 0 to 90 degree angles, with a select few topping at 135 degrees. Plus, a few of these top picks come with multiple preset depths.</p> <p>Though the cutting instruments themselves are the most important feature, these joiners also come with dust bags, blade replacements, carrying cases, and more for convenience and safe storing. Plus, the barrel grips and positive stops allow for maximum control while operating.</p> <h2>Safety Tips for Using a Biscuit Joiner</h2> <p>In general, biscuit joiners are safe power tools—but that could inspire some false confidence. As you become more comfortable using it, you might feel that you can hold the workpiece with one hand while you cut biscuits with the other. It’s best to avoid this temptation, as the front lip of the board could lift, potentially causing you to strike your hand with the running biscuit joiner. Instead, clamp your workpieces to your workbench for a stable base.</p> <p>Before you start cutting slots for biscuits, do your best to ensure that there are no nails, knots, or other obstructions where you’ll be cutting. In most cases, the blade will simply cut through these obstructions, dulling the blade a bit. However, there is potential for the biscuit joiner to send a chunk of the obstruction flying with enough speed to hurt you.</p> <p>Biscuit joiners can produce a lot of dust. While a dust collection system can help reduce the amount of sawdust you have to deal with, it can’t get it all. Be sure to wear a mask to avoid breathing in airborne dust and safety glasses to keep it out of your eyes. This safety gear is especially important when working with plywood and MDF. The glues and chemicals used in their manufacturing can be particularly irritating to your lungs and eyes.</p> <ul><li>Clamp your workpiece to your bench to avoid potentially striking your hand with the biscuit joiner.</li><li>Ensure that your workpiece is free of obstructions like nails and knots before cutting biscuit slots.</li><li>Wear safety glasses and a mask to protect yourself from sawdust.</li></ul>",415
451,router table,"<p>With so many router table options available, it can be hard to know which one can suit your needs and work correctly every time. Selections for the best and most effective router tables depended upon type, size, materials, fence type, and added special features for added precision while cutting or shaping.</p> <p>Since the type of router table greatly affects portability and intended use, the above list prioritizes both freestanding and benchtop models. Most of these portable router tables are also lightweight and compact to fit in your household workshop or on the jobsite. For added convenience, cast-aluminum and plastic constructions ensure durability and long lifespans.</p> <p>For precise cutting, many of these models come with single fence types for precise alignment. Finally, many of the above router brands have added features like adjuster handles, built-in dust collection, miter gauges, featherboards, cordless capability, foldable constructions, and some can be permanently mounted to a counter or bench.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Router Table</h2> <p>A router table adds a whole new world of functionality to a router, but it can be a little tricky to use at first. Read on for important tips regarding the proper use of a router table.</p> <ul><li>Clamp it down. Portable router tables and benches use a bench top or table for support. Before using a router bench, clamp it securely to the table or workbench to prevent it from sliding.</li><li>Use featherboards to apply down pressure. Most people will use the fence as a backstop on which to apply pressure to the board, but featherboards are just as important. These tools attach to the fence and apply down pressure to the board while it moves through the router bit. This prevents the board from coming up off the table under the pressure of the spinning router bit.</li><li>Tighten all bolts. There are two critical connections to check before using a router: the collet and router base. The collet holds a bit in place. Make sure it is tightly screwed to the router to prevent the bit from coming off while in use. Also make sure the bolts holding the router to the table are tight so the router stays in place while in use.</li><li>Use a push block for end routing. Routing the end of a board will often cause the wood fibers at the end corner to splinter as the blade passes through them. Using a push block that fits flush to the end will solve this problem and keep the wood fibers intact, preventing chipping.</li></ul>",415
452,cordless finish nailer,"<p>I’m a keen home remodeler, and for 10 years owned my own wood shop. I have used a variety of nail guns, and have a thorough understanding of their capabilities. To supplement my experience, and ensure we were aware of the latest development, we researched all the leading tool brands. We also took into account the views of other independent experts, and actual buyers.</p> <p>Although the review focuses solely on the best cordless finish nailers, there is still plenty of variety on offer. We selected quality tools that represent all the possible options in order to provide solutions for both DIY and professional users.</p> <p>Price is always a key issue, and we tried to offer something for all budgets. However, we avoided cheap cordless finish nailers from little known brands. These seldom perform up to expectations, and rarely represent lasting value.</p> <h2>Shopping for a Used or Refurbished Finish Nailer</h2> <p>Refurbished, renewed, or reconditioned power tools are becoming increasingly popular. In principal it’s a great idea. Instead of a tool with superficial scratches being dumped in the trash, it is checked for performance and offered at a reduced price. For the buyer this means either less expense, or the opportunity to upgrade to a better tool than they might otherwise have been unable to afford.</p> <p>How do I know they’re any good? It’s important to buy from recognized retailers. The tools they offer have often been reconditioned by the original manufacturer. Others simply have minor dings or scratches that don’t actually impact performance. They should have been inspected and tested. They should also have a warranty, though this may be less than the new model.</p> <p>What should I look out for? Check the returns policy, and the warranty. The two can be different. You want to know that you can get your money back if a reconditioned cordless finish nailer does not meet your expectations.</p> <p>Think about what you would want from a new cordless finish nailer (or other power tool) and then check the price if you bought it new. You should be looking to make significant savings. If a refurbished model is only $20 or $30 cheaper than the new model, you’ll want to ask yourself whether it is worth it.</p> <p>So where should I look? We found a number of renewed finish nailers on Amazon. Search results include new items in the list, which is a little frustrating, but there are some interesting deals. Walmart Refurbished is another option, though again, the search function could be better. Ebay also does refurbished tools, though the range seems limited.</p>",429
453,cordless reciprocating saw,"<p>Putting together a list of the best cordless reciprocating saws was tough work. We had to draw upon our experiences during time spent contracting and DIY projects to pick out the features we feel were need-to-haves and those we could do without.</p> <p>After coming up with a baseline of features to work with, we performed extensive product research to compile a list of cordless reciprocating saws from some of the best tool brands in the business. We then compared these models’ features, speeds, and prices to ensure we were suggesting reciprocating saws with a high return on investment. Once we threw out the models that didn’t meet our standards, we gave awards to the remaining products based on their strengths.</p> <h2>Shopping for a Used or Refurbished Reciprocating Saw</h2> <p>For folks who don’t want to invest a ton of money into a tool they might not use that often, there is always the secondary market. The used marketplace is often full of tools that DIYers purchased and have since moved on from, and they’re willing to sell some of the best reciprocating saws for a serious discount.</p> <p>Shoppers should check sites like Amazon Renew, eBay Refurbished, and Walmart Refurbished for reciprocating saws. These sites commonly carry the most popular power tools and sell them for significantly less than a shopper might pay for a new version.</p> <p>If purchasing directly from a private seller off of a classified site, there are a few things to consider:</p> <ul><li>Check that the saw actually runs by snapping the battery in and pulling the trigger (in a safe manner, of course). Listen for any strange noises or clunking.</li><li>Check that the blade chuck works correctly.</li><li>Shake the tool and listen for any rattling inside the saw.</li><li>Plan on replacing the battery relatively soon (so don’t pay top dollar).</li></ul>",299
454,corded circular saw,"<p>In addition to owning my own wood shop, I have remodeled two homes from the ground up. I have owned low cost, and premium brand circular saws so I know what to look out for. To make sure we had a full picture of the current corded circular saw market the team researched the latest products from all the leading tool brands.</p> <p>In order to underline the differences in specification discussed above, we tried to make as varied a selection as possible so we had something to meet all needs. Durability is a key issue, so while cheaper corded circular saws may be available, we stuck with tried and trusted brands. However, we are also keenly aware of how important price is, so we made sure there were tools to suit all budgets.</p> <h2>Shopping for a Used or Refurbished Circular Saw</h2> <p>Historically, most people would baulk at the idea of spending good money on a used or second hand tool, but today’s refurbished models are not the dubious equipment found at a neighborhood yard sale. For some time, reputable manufacturers and retailers have been offering refurbished or renewed products like circular saws alongside new models.</p> <p>The idea is that when a commercially viable fix is possible, it cuts down on waste—which is always a good thing. It may also offer buyers the opportunity to acquire products that might otherwise be outside their budget.</p> <p>These should not be tools that have been beaten to death for 364 days and returned on the day the warranty expires. It’s true that often they have been tried by another buyer but will have been returned within a relatively short return window. Other times, they might be tools damaged in transit or in the warehouse.</p> <p>So are refurbished circular saws any good? In our opinion, yes. There’s every chance they could represent a real bargain. There are some interesting offers on refurbished or renewed circular saws at Amazon and Walmart among others. However, care and common sense is needed.</p> <ul><li>Specify the type of saw you want first. Look at new models. Then see what you can get on the refurbished market that comes close to those specifications.</li><li>Keep a tight rein on your budget. It’s easy to get carried away. The idea here is to save money, or get better value.</li><li>You should be looking for a substantial cost reduction. If the saving is only saving 10 percent or 15 percent, it might be better to buy new.</li><li>Make sure you know exactly what is included. Cordless tools often won’t include battery or charger, for example.</li><li>Be sure to check warranty and return periods before you order. Don’t make assumptions, even if you bought from the retailer before.</li></ul> <p>While refurbished, reconditioned, or renewed tools are often excellent, there’s always a chance it could be a dud. Buy from a reputable source. Check the saw as soon as it arrives so you can get your money back if there’s a problem.</p>",491
455,rotary hammer drill,"<p>A great deal of research goes into making our selections. It is conducted by experts with years of experience and in-depth technical knowledge. I am an engineer by trade and understand the key features in determining performance. I also have undertaken two complete house renovations using this type of tool, so I know first-hand how a rotary hammer drill functions.</p> <p>I believe the most important factors are available power, recommended maximum diameter, and impact energy. These largely determine the force that can be applied to a particular task and differentiate DIY tools from pro models.</p> <p>I also have given consideration to the manufacturers’ reputations. Certain brands have long-standing reputations for reliability and durability. That said, I was careful not to overlook a bargain even if the maker is not one of the big names.</p>",134
456,portable table saws,"<p>In addition to being an engineer by profession, I have owned my own woodshop and undertaken several large remodeling projects. As a result, I have a hands-on understanding of the characteristics of a good portable table saw.</p> <ul><li>Portability: Obviously, a portable table saw’s ability to be moved is a key feature, and our selection represents each of the different transportation approaches.</li><li>Cutting capacities: This list includes a range of tools that offer different capabilities, so there’s something for everyone, from weekend DIY enthusiasts to full-time professionals.</li><li>Quality: While cheap portable table saws are available, this list includes only those brands with recognized reputations for durability and reliability. Some, however, are quite affordable.</li></ul> <h2>Tips on How to Use a Portable Table Saw</h2> <p>Although most people probably want to start working right away when their new portable table saw arrives, even experienced users should read the manufacturer’s instruction manual. Failure to do so may mean they don’t maximize the potential of their saw. For any model, some one-size-fits-all safety tips to keep in mind when using a table saw include:</p> <ul><li>Always wear appropriate safety gear: a dust mask, safety glasses or goggles, and ear protection.</li><li>Keep hands well away from the blade. Whenever practical, use a push stick to guide the material.</li><li>Always unplug the saw before making adjustments to the blade.</li><li>Follow the old woodworker’s adage to “measure twice, and cut once.” Double-checking saw setup increases accuracy and reduces waste.</li><li>The fence is for ripping, and it’s not sturdy enough to provide sufficient support for crosscutting. Use a miter gauge set at 90 degrees to the blade.</li></ul>",260
457,glue for metal,"<p>I am an engineer by profession so I have considerable experience with metals and a range of adhesives. I’m also a keen DIYer and have used several of these products at home. Added to first-hand knowledge are many hours of research into chemical composition and how that affects the way glues for metal bond with other materials.</p> <p>All of our top picks come from widely recognized brands. These are companies with vast experience that have invested heavily in their products. They also have technical know-how to back up their claims. We have also been careful to check prices in order to offer good value for money.</p> <h2>Tips for Using the Best Glue for Metal</h2> <p>While everyone should have a tube or two of glue in a junk drawer or tool box, each type of glue for metal behaves differently, so it is extremely important to follow manufacturers’ instructions to ensure a lasting bond. However, there are a few general tips that will help maximize performance from all of these adhesives.</p> <ul><li>Always think safety first, and read the product label. The glue may give off unpleasant fumes that make it necessary to work in a well-ventilated area. We recommend eye protection and lightweight nitrile work gloves.</li><li>It is important that the metal’s glue surface is free from contamination like oil and grease, rust, flaking paint, brake dust, etc. A rag soaked in mineral spirits can be used to wipe the surface. High-strength metal cleaners can also be used, as long as they don’t leave a residue.</li><li>Some glues for metal benefit from being clamped while they cure. It is often worth doing a test assembly to make sure you have everything on hand, especially if the glue starts to cure quickly and you have limited time to work.</li></ul>",295
458,drywall sanders,"<p>As an engineer, I have a good understanding of the technical aspects of these tools. As someone who has completed ground-up remodeling of two homes, I have practical experience with drywall sanding. I have also conducted considerable research into the range of tools currently available and the opinions of users and independent reviewers.</p> <p>We have been careful to cover methods of drywall sanding for all budgets. While powered models are undoubtedly more efficient on large jobs, we have included affordable manual versions that will make even relatively small tasks that much easier.</p> <p>Build quality was also a key feature, regardless of drywall sander type or cost. Drywall dust can play havoc with linkages, mechanisms, and motors, so it was important our picks could stand up to this difficult environment.</p>",129
459,tool subscription boxes,"<p>In selecting the tool subscription companies for this list, we considered several criteria. For a subscription service to be worth the money, it must deliver useful tools, so we only included well-curated boxes of tools, PPE, and supplies with minimal inclusion of useless extras. Quality is also important, so we limited our picks mainly to subscription boxes that included recognizable name brands. Finally, we considered subscription boxes that offer the best bang for the buck without lofty additional shipping fees.</p> <h2>Tips on Choosing the Best Tool Subscription Box</h2> <p>When sifting through the best tool boxes that offer subscriptions, it’s vital to consider what’s inside. Though none of these services will tell you exactly what you’ll be getting, most focus on specific items. One service may provide strictly hand tools while others may include PPE, consumable supplies like wood glue and varnish, and swag, such as T-shirts and hats. Choose the subscription box that best meets your needs. When it comes to tools, brand is paramount, so look closely at the manufacturers included in the kit. Household names such as Milwaukee, DeWalt, and Bosch indicate higher quality than boxes that include no-name brands. Frequency is also important. In addition to looking at the price of the kit, consider how often the kit is delivered as well as any delivery fees that are tacked on.</p> <ul><li>Look at the types of tools and supplies included in the box.</li><li>Choose subscription boxes that feature reputable tool manufacturers.</li><li>Consider shipping fees as well as subscription prices.</li></ul>",249
460,woodworking tools,"<p>I am an engineer, a DIY enthusiast, and for 11 years ran a woodworking shop. I have a thorough understanding of how these tools work and hands-on experience using them. Extensive product research has also been conducted to ensure up-to-date information.</p> <p>Usually we compare a range of similar tools for these helpful guides. In this case, each tool is different. Nevertheless, many of the criteria remain the same.</p> <p>First, we looked at top performers. While specifications can be impressive, we were also careful to consider cost. Some of the best woodworking tools are simply too expensive for most home users. They might also be too large for all but commercial workshops.</p> <p>Brand reputation also has a major impact. Names like Bosch, DeWalt, Makita, and SKIL have long been recognized for build quality, and each makes an appearance in our list. However, we were also careful to look at sub-premium brands (though most are still household names). In doing so, we believe we have offered the widest possible choice, with tools for woodworkers at different stages of learning and with different budgets.</p>",181
461,welding gloves,"<p>We used a variety of criteria to review more than 2 dozen pairs of welding gloves for this guide. Since protection is crucial when it comes to welding gloves, we chose models that use materials that provide excellent heat protection with heat ratings of up to 932 degrees Fahrenheit. The gloves on our list consist of thick leather with insulation, such as aluminum foil, and heat-resistant Kevlar stitching. For the best MIG welding gloves and best stick welding gloves, we prioritized heat protection over flexibility. For the best TIG welding gloves, we looked for models that offer a better feel and range of motion while still providing adequate heat protection. Durability was also a factor, so we chose models that reinforced common wear points on gloves, including the palms and area between the forefinger and thumb.</p>",136
462,makita drills,"<p>Normally Bob Vila reviews products from different manufacturers against each other in order to identify our top picks; see the best cordless drills, for example. Clearly, when looking for the best Makita drills, we’re dealing with the same manufacturer. So the tools aren’t in competition as such.</p> <p>However, as we mentioned, the Makita drills range is huge and it isn’t always easy to differentiate between the models. What we have tried to do is pick out the best performers in a variety of categories, taking into account the criteria discussed in our considerations section above.</p> <p>The resulting top picks are a variety of different Makita drills that offer solutions to all kinds of job challenges and will appeal to a wide range of users.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Makita Drill</h2> <p>Makita has been making power tools since 1958. It introduced its first cordless drill in 1978 and its first brushless model in 2004 (at the time only available to the defense and aerospace industries). The company introduced the world’s first 18V brushless impact driver in 2009. Few tool manufacturers have that kind of experience, and Makita drills invariably rank as either the best drill brand or runner-up (to DeWalt) in dozens of independent reviews for performance and reliability.</p> <ul><li>The Makita drills range is extensive, from competitively priced DIY drill/drivers models to pro-grade demolition hammers.</li><li>Makita drills have renowned reliability and durability.</li><li>Makita batteries are known for their fast charging and long service life.</li><li>Makita has had U.S. manufacturing and assembly since 1985, with highly rated customer support.</li><li>The 18/36V LXT cordless range now includes over 250 different tools, and all of them can use the same batteries.</li></ul>",274
463,mig welders,"<p>As an engineer and amateur auto enthusiast, I have hands-on experience with MIG welding. To support this knowledge, Bob Vila researchers investigated a wide variety of the latest products to make sure we had current technical information.</p> <p>While amperage and duty cycle are the headline elements when choosing a MIG welder, we didn’t look only at those that offered high performance. For example, we also chose more budget-friendly models that might be the best MIG welder for beginners or hobby users.</p> <p>Long-term reliability is a key issue, so we focused mostly on MIG welders from well-known manufacturers with an established reputation. However, we are always conscious of costs, so we included more affordable models from lesser-known makers if they provided acceptable performance and good value.</p> <h2>Safety Tips for Using a MIG Welder</h2> <p>Welding metal must be treated with caution. Following these straightforward rules will help avoid accidents:</p> <ul><li>Before starting, have a thorough understanding of how a MIG welder functions and how to set it up safely. For those new to welding, we recommend getting expert guidance such as taking classes or getting the help of a professional while learning the basics.</li><li>Sparks and spatter (molten waste metal) are inevitable, and they can burn skin and clothing. Wear appropriate protective clothing.</li><li>Always wear a welding mask. The brightness of the weld causes a condition called “welder’s flash” or “arc eye.”</li><li>Make sure the area is ventilated, particularly if using flux-core wire.</li><li>Clear the area of flammable material, and invest in a fire blanket or extinguisher.</li><li>Make sure to stay fully focused. Never weld if tired or unwell.</li></ul>",261
464,tig welders,"<p>I am an engineer by profession, and I also like to tinker with old vehicles in my spare time. I have worked with a variety of welders, and although I haven’t used TIG welding often, I understand the techniques. The Bob Vila team augmented my experience with market research to ensure we had all the relevant, up-to-date information.</p> <p>Performance is key, but rather than compare a range of high-end models, we have tried to find tools that meet all needs. We set out to find a good TIG welder for aluminum (because it is one of the materials at which TIG excels for welding), but we also looked for the best TIG welder for home use, pros, or certain features.</p> <p>Durability is a major factor, and we largely chose brands that are recognized within the industry for long-term reliability. That said, we also considered small TIG welders for those with a modest budget, provided there was sufficient user feedback to warrant their inclusion.</p>",163
465,table saws for beginners,"<p>In selecting the best entry-level table saw options for this lineup, we determined essential needs for those just learning to use this power tool. While beginner tools in other categories are often less powerful—or a lot less expensive—that rule of thumb does not hold true when it comes to table saws. Injuries from table saws, typically finger or hand amputations, are more common than injuries from other power tools, so this is not the tool to skimp on quality and safety features.</p> <p>With that in mind, we exhaustively researched dozens of today’s top table saw models to choose units that are easy to use, safe, sturdy, and accurate. We looked at models from well-known manufacturers that have earned a reputation for quality. Still, we didn’t automatically exclude models from smaller or niche manufacturers if they feature quality materials and have a stellar reputation.</p> <p>Table saws aren’t cheap tools, but a good one should last for years and provide a high level of safety.</p>",163
466,dewalt impact drivers,"<p>When making our selections, we took into account the fact that DeWalt’s line of impact drivers is designed to suit the needs of both DIYers and professionals. Most DIYers and pros tend to choose the most powerful tool when purchasing an impact driver. While an impact driver that offers the most torque certainly makes it usable in a broader range of applications, these top-end tools come with a steep price tag. Shelling out a lot of money for an impact driver that has more power than one will ever use makes no sense.</p> <p>With that in mind, we tailored our list of the top DeWalt drivers to suit DIY projects as well as pro projects. With DIYers in mind, we included DeWalt impact drivers that offered enough torque for home projects without breaking the bank. We also included professional tools that provide the high torque needed for commercial applications as well as features that appeal to professionals, such as Tool Connect.</p>",161
467,welders for beginners,"<p>I am an engineer by trade. While I now have considerable experience of welding processes, I still remember what it was like starting out and the challenges beginners face. To support my own knowledge, the Bob Vila team researched dozens of welders to ensure we had full information on any recent developments.</p> <p>While often our articles compare quite similar tools, in this case the challenge was to find a variety of models to suit beginner welders who want to try TIG or stick welding, in addition to the traditional MIG and flux core processes.</p> <p>Ease of use is key, but the best welders for beginners still need to provide sufficient performance to achieve professional welding standards. While some budget welders have been included, most come from well-known brands that offer durability and long-term value.</p>",134
468,welding helmets,"<p>I am an engineer by profession, and while not a full-time welder I have extensive experience with the processes and equipment. The Bob Vila team also researched all of the leading manufacturers to ensure they were current with the latest technologies. Feedback from hundreds of real-world users was considered too.</p> <ul><li>Performance: This pertains to how well the welding helmet does its job of protecting the welder without impeding work. It takes into account versatility, adjustability, and comfort. The factors covered in the considerations section above informed our choices, and we looked for models that were appropriate for a variety of different users.</li><li>Durability: Welding helmets should have an operating life of around 7 to 10 years, but elements can fail ahead of time. If we found significant instances of this, regardless of whether the error or component could be fixed, that model didn’t make the cut.</li><li>Value: With safety equipment like welding helmets, low price alone was not our main concern. Instead, all welding helmets chosen—including budget-friendly models—had to provide quality. That said, a more affordable welding helmet might well be the right choice for a hobbyist but may not offer all the features a professional user needs. A welding helmet that costs several hundred dollars can still be a good value for a pro. We looked for a selection of top models across the entire price range.</li></ul>",226
469,milwaukee drills,"<p>Like many experienced DIYers, I have used a number of cordless drills. I am also an engineer by profession, with a thorough understanding of how these tools function. To support my own knowledge, the Bob Vila team investigated the latest Milwaukee lineup to make sure we had up-to-date information.</p> <p>Most Bob Vila tool reviews compare devices from a variety of manufacturers head-to-head to find, for example, the best angle grinder. In this case, while individual performance is important, we also wanted to find solutions for as many different types of user as possible. While that task might seem straightforward, with over 60 different model combinations to choose from, it took many hours of research to arrive at our top picks.</p>",120
470,metal cutting saws,"<p>As an engineer, I have extensive experience with metal-cutting saws. The Bob Vila team also researched leading brands and the latest products to make sure we were aware of recent developments. While the technical aspects discussed here are clearly important, several other key factors impacted our choices.</p> <ul><li>Type: Although lots of different types of metal-cutting saws are available and chop saws are popular among metal workers and welders, they aren’t the best metal-cutting saw to trim rebar set in concrete or saw through metal piping installed in a building. Our goal was to choose models that provide solutions for a variety of different users.</li><li>Value: We tried to find metal-cutting saws for every budget, but we never base our choices on price alone. Each of these saws comes from a brand with an established reputation for reliability and durability to ensure long-term value.</li></ul> <h2>Safety Tips for Using Metal-Cutting Saws</h2> <p>Any saw that can cut metal has the potential to be dangerous, but taking a few simple precautions will help prevent accidents.</p> <ul><li>Read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Make sure you understand how the machine works and how to turn it off quickly.</li><li>Always wear protective goggles or safety glasses. Cutting metal is usually quite noisy, so wearing ear protection is also a good idea.</li><li>Metal can sometimes get hot when being sawed, and cut edges can be sharp. Experts recommend that you wear strong, heat-resistant gloves.</li><li>Make sure any guards are in place correctly. Although you may be tempted to remove them for a better view, don’t.</li><li>Sparks are often generated when cutting metal. Make sure flammable liquids are well away from the work area.</li><li>Securely clamp the item you plan to cut, and never lift a workpiece into a rotating saw blade. If the metal catches or is thrown out, it can cause serious injury. Band saws with vertical tables are an exception, as the workpiece cannot be pulled into the blade.</li></ul>",316
471,welding boots,"<p>Any time an item or article of clothing is required to keep an individual safe during a specific task, the primary factor for consideration needs to be the ability of the product to protect the user. With this in mind, we conducted extensive research to find the top choices for this list from more than 35 options. Safety was the priority during the selection process, but it was also necessary to consider the available sizes, types, construction, and any additional features that could help a pair of welding boots stand out from similar products.</p> <p>The best welding boots needed to be able to protect the wearer adequately from flame, heat, and molten-metal spatter. To achieve this level of protection, the products we selected were typically made with heat-resistant leather and had a safety toe cap. Some welding boots also came with a metatarsal guard to prevent damage to the top of the wearer’s foot.</p> <p>Laced and pull-on welding boots were both included in the list of the best boots for welding in men’s and women’s options because individuals may have different preferences based on type. While laces can pose a fire risk during welding, making the switch to pull-on boots may not be a choice some people are willing to make.</p>",211
472,work boots for electricians,"<p>Putting together a list of the best electrician work boots was no small task. We had to draw on years of experience in the trades as well as our knowledge of work boots to come up with the features we felt were most important before we could even start looking at boots.</p> <p>Once we knew which features we were looking for, we performed extensive product research to compile a list of the best shoes for electricians that met our criteria. We then dove deeper on each pair, comparing features and prices to ensure we were suggesting nothing but the best quality and value. We tossed the boots that didn’t offer enough value to the side, and then awarded the remaining boots a spot on this list based on their strengths.</p>",130
473,welding jackets,"<p>Safety was the primary factor of importance when it came to selecting this list of the best welding jackets. If a product could not keep the user safe while they were welding, then it did not qualify for consideration. During the selection process, it was necessary to conduct extensive research on over 30 different welding jackets, including cotton, leather, and hybrid options, in order to find the top welding jackets that stood out from competitors.</p> <p>As mentioned, the main consideration for selection was safety. With this in mind, the material and construction of the welding jackets served as a basis for determining how each product would hold up during different welding operations. Cotton jackets were more vulnerable to the high temperatures produced by heavy stick and MIG welding, while leather and hybrid jackets could deal with heavy stick, MIG, and TIG welding without a problem.</p> <p>Availability of sizes also factored into the final selection because it’s important to find products that fit properly. Otherwise, an oversize jacket may shift and leave your skin exposed or a welding jacket that is too small could ride up, exposing your wrists or forearms.</p>",190
474,tactical flashlights,"<p>Tactical flashlights should provide the user with a reliable light source in challenging conditions such as emergencies and outdoor adventure. To choose the best tactical flashlights of 2022, we compared the features of more than 40 tac lights for the most durable materials, the best battery life, and the brightest output.</p> <p>For our best tactical flashlight review, the factors we focused on were adaptability, weight, and brightness, and we also looked at beam distance and light modes because these tend to be features that will come in handy when you’re looking for a good tac light. We also considered price as tactical flashlights for emergency kits as well as other day-to-day use can get expensive.</p> <p>Tactical flashlights are often used for self-defense as well as recreation, so the best military flashlight might also be excellent for outdoor sports. Battery life can vary a great deal between models, so we spent some time looking for models that had good scores in that regard, too.</p>",163
475,tool belt,"<p>The following criteria resulted from in-depth research and actual hands-on experience with tool belts during extensive remodeling projects.</p> <p>Comfort. It doesn’t matter whether a tool belt carries five tools or 50; if it isn’t reasonably comfortable, it won’t serve its purpose. That’s not to say all tool belts offer equal comfort, but they need to provide a level of comfort appropriate to their design.</p> <p>Capacity. Some people need a belt that will hold just four or five tools. Some might need to carry a dozen or more. To ensure we offered choice for all kinds of users, we included a wide range of capacities.</p> <p>Durability and value. DIYers and pros seldom look after their tool belts, so good construction and quality matter. At the same time, cost matters, too. Our broad selection offers quality pieces for all budgets.</p>",138
476,attic ladder,"<p>To put together this list of the best attic ladders, it was necessary to research more than 30 products. Attic ladders are used for accessible ingress to the attic and egress from the attic, so they need to be able to support the weight of the user and provide enough space for the average person to move freely up and down.</p> <p>Convenience and portability also factor into the product design. For instance, an electric steel scissor attic ladder can fold up into the attic or fold down with the touch of a button. However, it’s more common to see manual pull-down ladders that can be released by hand or with an assist pole, then when the user is done with the ladder, it folds up into the attic space.</p> <p>Telescoping ladders may also slide up into the attic or they could be portable models that can be tucked into a closet when the ladder isn’t required. The ceiling height was also a consideration during the selection process because if the ladder doesn’t reach the ground or extends too far, it won’t work for the given space. If a product had additional features, such as textured steps to help prevent slips, it typically stood out from similar attic ladders that lacked these extra features.</p>",213
477,rolling tool box,"<p>The products selected for this list resulted from extensive product research that involved analyzing design, durability, and usefulness. We considered well-known manufacturers when compiling the list, but we didn’t automatically eliminate smaller or niche manufacturers if their products were made from high-quality materials and designed well.</p> <br/> <br/> <p>We looked at more than 30 different rolling tool boxes for this lineup and eventually whittled down the options to those that appear in the above list. Along the way, we eliminated the rest of the tool boxes if they contained substandard materials or were not easy to assemble or use. While the tool boxes on our list vary in usage, we feel we’ve selected the top-performing models available today.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Rolling Tool Box</h2> <p>Keeping the tools you need within reach makes any project go quicker. Rather than having to maneuver repeatedly between a tool chest and a project you’re working on, a rolling tool box allows you to bring the tools right to where you’re working.</p> <p>With a rolling tool box you can organize the types of tools you’ll need, such as sockets and wrenches for automotive work, and keep them within arm’s reach.<br/> When you want to rearrange your work space, you can move a rolling tool box anywhere you want in the garage.<br/> Some rolling tool boxes are also portable, which means you can stuff them full of tools and then transport everything to a different jobsite.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning a Rolling Tool Box</h2> <p>Keeping the tools you need within reach makes any project go quicker.

478,moving straps,"<p>Moving straps provide a convenient, hassle-free way to move heavy electronics and furniture without the cost of a moving company’s help. The above picks were selected based on a variety of factors including ease of use, weight capacity, materials used, and thoughtful construction.</p> <p>Some of the above options come with adjustable harnesses or arm loops which can prevent damage to your legs, back, and knees. While the harnesses offer hands-free potential for opening doors or supporting the carried object, the arm loops can offer quick height adjustments as you move. The above selections also have straps with 2-inch to 3-inch widths for added stability and comfort.</p> <p>These top picks also prioritize weight capacity with some options being able to hold 600- to 800- pound objects. Finally, some of these options come with padded straps, adjustable strap lengths, or protective/reinforced liners for comfort and security.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Moving Straps</h2> <p>Moving straps are handy in a number of situations, not just when you’re moving from one house to another. Many people benefit from having them available for unexpected moving projects around the house or even around the neighborhood.</p> <ul><li>Move the largest items in the house with yourself and a partner.</li><li>Manage heavy, awkward items without strain or injury to the back and shoulders.</li><li>Some moving strap designs allow a single user to move bulky items alone.</li></ul>",224
479,portable tool box,"<p>I am an engineer by profession, and in addition to large, work-related tool boxes, I have had several more compact models at home. To supplement my own experience, the Bob Vila team conducted extensive market research ensuring we have up-to-date information on portable tool box developments.</p> <p>The task was to find portable tool boxes that offer a wide variety of solutions. Sometimes a portable tool box will suit both DIYers and professionals, but often their needs are different. Whatever the size or style of a portable tool box, everyone is looking for value, and for us that was a key issue. That doesn’t mean a budget model is always the right solution. Sometimes spending a little more is the better long-term option.</p>",122
480,duct tape,"<p>Whether you need a quick fix for a leak or crack, or are in the market for your next crafting tape, this list of top picks includes some of the best adhesives that remain durable whether indoors or out. With the stronger adhesive tapes on this list, be advised that once they are affixed to a surface, they may be difficult to remove and leave behind a sticky residue.</p> <p>Many of the featured options are made with a multifunctional adhesive for a variety of light projects. Other products contain double-thick glue and a reinforced backing for all weather conditions to handle the toughest of outdoor jobs. Additionally, several top picks come in a variety of colorways with ample tape per roll, and will remain affixed to different surface types.</p> <h2>The Advantages of Owning Duct Tape</h2> <p>Duct tape is so popular due to its high durability, tensile strength, adhesive strength, and water resistance. It can stretch tightly while being applied to form a strong seal and once in place resists shifting, sagging, cracking, and breaking.</p> <p>The strong adhesive helps to bond the durable backing to almost any surface, including brick, stone, metal, wood, plastic, cardboard, and more. The highly weather-resistant, and sometimes waterproof, nature of duct tape makes it great for outdoor repairs.</p> <ul><li>The durability and high tensile strength of duct tape resist cracking, stretching, and breaking.</li><li>High adhesive strength helps to ensure that duct tape can stick to most surfaces without issue.</li><li>Duct tape can be used for outdoor repairs due to the water-resistant backing and adhesive.</li></ul>",255
481,scroll saw,"<p>Putting together a list of the best scroll saws takes a lot of work. We want to be sure we’re suggesting only the best tools on the market so you’re able to get right to crafting or cutting with the best scroll saw for you.</p> <p>First, we relied on our experience in working with scroll saws, as we know what to look for in these tools. Next, we conducted lengthy product research. We compared each model’s features, power, capability, and uses. We also compared materials to ensure you’ll be getting a high-quality tool that will last for years. By gathering this experience, doing the research, and making comparisons, we were able to put together this list of some of the best scroll saws available.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Scroll Saw</h2> <p>It’s better to “feed” the saw than to force a piece of material across it. This means gently guiding the material across the blade and allowing the saw to do the work. Forcing materials through the saw can jam the blade and break it, as well as cost valuable accuracy.</p> <p>If you’re cutting several pieces that are the same shape, it helps to stack them on top of each other and make all the cuts at one time. Just be sure to go slowly, as the additional surface area will increase friction.</p> <p>Scrolling often requires excellent attention to detail and small tolerances. Give yourself plenty of light so you can see your cut lines, the saw, and other details that might affect your result. If your saw comes with a work light, use it. If not, set up a small clamp light nearby.</p> <ul><li>Feed the saw, don’t force it</li><li>Stack workpieces to cut several pieces of the same shape at once</li><li>Give yourself plenty of light</li></ul>",294
482,anti fog safety glasses,"<p>In making our selections for this list of top safety glasses, we considered a variety of important criteria. First and foremost, safety glasses must be able to endure impacts from projectiles, so we only chose ANSI-rated safety glasses, and beyond that favored those with military-grade protection. Coverage is also vital to safety glasses’ effectiveness, so we chose those that offer side coverage as well as head-on projectile protection.</p> <p>Many jobs require wearing safety glasses for the entire workday, so we favored lightweight models with comfortable design attributes.

To cover a range of projects, we picked the top product for the primary use (including all-purpose glues, spray glues, and heavy-duty glues). We also considered affordability. Don’t use an expensive styrofoam glue when a budget-friendly option works just as well.</p> <h2>Tips on How to Glue Styrofoam Together</h2> <p>Gluing styrofoam together or to other materials is fairly easy with a suitable glue, which makes finding a suitable glue an important first step. Some glues don’t work very well with styrofoam, and others can even melt or dissolve the foam. Ensure the glue can hold on both styrofoam and any other surface.</p> <p>Always follow the product’s directions for the best hold, and pay attention to the manufacturer’s safety instructions. If necessary, clean and prep the surface, removing any loose styrofoam bits, dirt, and dust that can affect the glue’s hold. A thin, even coat of glue is usually enough. Since some glues expand, using too much can cause it to run out the sides. Even though styrofoam is lightweight, it can still slide and shift if the glue is not tacky enough to keep it in place. Hold the pieces firmly together until the glue has set.</p> <p>Most glue products can be used more than once. Tighten the cap on the container to prevent it from drying out and store it as directed.</p> <ul><li>Choose a styrofoam-safe glue</li><li>Follow safety instructions</li><li>Ensure the styrofoam surface is dirt- and dust-free</li><li>Use a thin, even coat of glue</li><li>Store as directed</li></ul>",337

494,lawn mower blade sharpeners,"<p>Choosing the best lawn mower blade sharpeners wasn’t an easy task. We had to draw upon all of our experience with lawn-care equipment and lawn mower maintenance in order to pick out the features we thought were most important to have in a blade sharpener, giving us a foundation to work from.</p> <p>With those features in mind, we performed extensive product research in order to round up models we felt would hit our criteria. We then compared materials, types, and prices to ensure we were suggesting options that provided actual value. The models that failed this test were discarded, and those that passed were given awards based on their strengths.</p> <h2>Tips for Using Lawn Mower Blade Sharpeners</h2> <p>Lawn mower blades don’t need to be razor-sharp to be effective. In general, grinding a 35- to 45-degree angle on a lawn mower blade will result in a durable edge that is sharp enough to avoid damaging the grass. Finer angles can dull quickly, while steeper angles will struggle to cut effectively.</p> <p>Users should be sure to wear gloves and eye protection whenever they’re grinding anything. Small metal shavings can become airborne and embed themselves, causing painful injuries.</p> <p>Sometimes, speed is the enemy. Grinders that spin too quickly can create excessive heat in the lawn mower blade. Excessive heat may cause the blade to become brittle. Also, keep the blade (or grinder) moving to prevent heat buildup in one area.</p> <ul><li>Maintain an angle between 35 and 45 degrees.</li><li>Users should wear eye protection and gloves whenever they’re grinding.</li><li>Avoid heat buildup by controlling the grinder’s speed and keeping the blade moving.</li></ul>",266
495,sharpening stone,"<p>When gathering our top picks for this list of recommendations, we focused our research on the most reliable types of sharpening stones: waterstones. Our findings showed that while oil stones are still used, the mess they create during use is not attractive to shoppers. As such, we have not included any oil stones on our list. That said, we did include an option that is suitable for use as both a water and an oil stone.</p> <p>In addition to this, we also made sure to include a range of grits, from 120 to 12,000, allowing users the flexibility to choose the right stone for their knife. Many of our top picks also come with useful accessories like a nonslip base, angle guide, and flattening stone. For the extra cautious, we even recommend a set that comes with a pair of cut-resistant gloves.</p> <h2>Tips for Using a Sharpening Stone</h2> <p>Sharpening stones can restore a set of quality knives to their former glory. To achieve that, it’s essential to follow a few crucial tips.</p> <ul><li>Assess your knives. Determine how dull your knives are and decide what grit you should use. Cut test slices through a tomato or another fruit or vegetable. The harder it is to get the knife through the fruit, the duller the knife is. Use a knife you know is sharp as a benchmark if you need to.</li><li>Soak the stone. Most stones need to be soaked in water to function correctly. If you’re using a water stone or ceramic stone, this is a crucial step. If you’re using an oil stone, you’ll need to prep the stone with cutting oil.</li><li>Know the grit. Like sandpaper, sharpening stones have different grit levels. Research which grit level you should use to sharpen a blade properly.</li><li>Find the 20-degree angle. Most blades should be sharpened at a 20-degree angle, but this angle can be a challenge to figure out. Begin by holding the edge at a 90-degree angle. Tilt it halfway to the countertop to find 45 degrees. Then halve the distance to the surface again to reach roughly 20 degrees.</li><li>Place your stone on a damp washcloth. If you have a stone with a nonslip side, you can skip this tip. Otherwise, set the stone on a damp washcloth to hold it in place while you sharpen.</li><li>Test the edge of your sharpened knife on a piece of paper. If you’re not sure if you’ve sharpened your knife adequately, hold up a piece of paper and attempt to slice down through one edge. If the blade is sharp, it should cut through the paper easily.</li></ul>",430
496,soil for herbs,"<p>To start selecting the best soil for herbs, we did a deep dive into what most herbs need for successful plant growth.

We stuck with reputable gardening brands because we believe they’re popular for a reason: They have reliable and high-quality soil products.</p> <p>Many of these soils and mixes are versatile, which means they can be used to grow herbs and other plants, both indoors and outdoors. We chose a few more specialized products as well, such as mixes made specifically for seeds, outdoor gardens, and an indoor potting soil, to cover growing herbs from start to harvest in a variety of locations.</p>",155
497,power recliners,"<p>While reviewing the best power recliners, the first factor that comes to mind is size. It’s also one of the more variable traits among the power recliners on the market. From seat widths for various hip sizes to chair widths that impact delivery, it’s a smart idea to do a lot of measuring before purchasing a power recliner.</p> <p>Price is another key factor we considered, as a power recliner can easily cost more than a large couch. Durability can drive up prices, so how much does longevity matter? A higher price tag doesn’t always reflect a more premium upholstery material (such as leather), but most leather options came with longer warranty and repair contracts through the manufacturer.</p> <p>We curated a durable group of power recliner chairs and tried to bring forward the best of what’s available today. Both typical overstuffed models as well as sleek modern designs are included in the list. There is a range of sizes included on this list, as recliners need to match the user, and one recliner definitely does not fit all.</p>",177
498,drywall anchors,"<p>Having carried out extensive remodels on two homes, we’ve used each of the drywall anchor types myself. One of us is an engineer by profession, so we understand the materials and physical properties. To ensure our information was up to date, the Bob Vila team also researched a wide range of manufacturers and suppliers.</p> <p>When choosing the best drywall anchor options for this article, we wanted to include as wide a variety as possible while still offering appropriate performance. Each of the top picks showcases a particular aspect of these devices, giving drywall-anchor buyers an overall view of the market as well as solutions to specific tasks.</p> <p>None of these fixings are particularly expensive, but price is always a consideration. We were careful to look for good value, but we avoided very cheap drywall anchors that tend to break easily, can damage the drywall during insertion, or may not provide a reliable attachment.</p>",153
