DIMENSIONS: Each frame measures 15.75x.70x23.75 inches and holds one 14x22 inch photograph or art print. QUALITY CONSTRUCTION: Each frame is constructed of durable MDF wood with a shatter resistant plexi front that helps prevent breakage. EASY TO USE: Easy to open turn buttons make adding your photograph a breeze; Frame includes pre-attached sawtooth hangers for vertical or horizontal hanging. WALL DECOR: With a passion for design, trend and functionality, MCS delivers best-in-class products that help make your house a home; Showcase your most cherished memories and favorite photographs with the Studio Gallery Frame Collection; With multiple sizes and finishes to choose from, you can create a beautiful gallery wall in your homenanThese are perfect frames. I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color. Overall I'm happy with the purchase! Doesn't look or feel like cheap frame material, so I think it's worth the price.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanHere Mitten's art really blends his work and the feeling achieved by Templesmith in the original series. There are some massive character redesigns that happened over the course of the prior book--Mitten slowly pushing Sam Keith's art out of the design palate. I talk about the art, however, because the plot here just doesn't work. Eben's motivations start to make no sense and the introduction of elder vampires has almost no consequence. Alice is neither ultimately all that important to the conclusion nor is her accident fully atoned for. Stella appears in dream/ghost form in a way that doesn't really change the Eben arc from either its rampage in the prior volume or his hero role for the rest of the series. The ending seems both rushed and tacked on.Absolutely wonderful graphics. Eben takes on an ancient vampire for control of the coven. Eben also is trying to reanimate the ashes of his dead wife. The FBI nearly gets wiped out by the vamps and everybody�s heading to LA.Did not disappoint. The continued story of the survivors of the massacre of Barrow, Alaska, going On a nationwide rampage.Really enjoyed this one, I wish it was made into a major movie soon. Can't recommend enough, really good issue.nanPro's:","Pro's:

I bought it to have an extra of the 11x14 to add to the package of 7 I bought of this same frame! They are super sleek durable and a great product, especially for the price!

You can contact us at any time and we will solve it for you in time.A frame does not have to do much, in my opinion. All it has to do, is not fall off the wall, and properly fit whichever poster you're framing.The poster I have is 18""x24"" exactly. This frame is not big enough, as it is 18""x23.75"". Therefore, I have two options: bring it somewhere to return it, or cut my poster. I should NOT have to cut my poster when I paid $30 for it. It doesn't even have the back closures that spin, only the ones that fold. It's like the ones at the dollar tree.Also, I would not be surprised if this fell off the wall. The back hanging looks like it's made of aluminum foil.How on earth does this thing have 4 stars on average?!It was exactly what I was looking for...clean simple lines.This frame was total garbage. It was well packaged, but badly warped (unusable). I tried to gently straighten it, which you can generally do with wood, but it snapped. This revealed that it was compressed fiber, not wood (please see photo).So the product description, which says ""Solid Wood"" is a TOTAL lie. Absolutely. No kidding.I think this is where my recycling has ended up. It is so much hassle to re-package and return (no easy drop-off options for this item) that I decided to write off the $47 and tell it like it is.This is a total garbage product. I went out and found very nice frames for about $75 in a bricks-and-mortar store. Anyway, I strongly recommend avoiding this product.Looks beautiful. Fit my picture perfect. Sturdy.The actual opening for the poster is only approximately 23.5x35.5, which means 24x36 posters DON�T FIT unless cut down. I had to use it anyway because it was for an event and there was no time to ship and replace� but MAJOR FAIL on the company that sells this.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: As a brand, we tend to shake things up in our industry. The status quo of women�s boxing gloves typically includes bright pink or purple variations of gloves designed for men. We�re here to change that. Finally, a glove made for women. Sanabul Easter Egg boxing gloves feature a much narrower silhouette that contours around your hand for a snug and comfortable fit. Generally speaking, women tend to have smaller hands and unisex boxing gloves are often too bulky. Far from boring, our women�s boxing gloves have an eye-catching pastel color palette only found within our brand. The outer material features a sleek, yet sophisticated, design with a matte-finish, making these gloves truly one of a kind. You don�t have to settle for less. Just because we created a fashion forward boxing glove doesn�t mean we cut corners with functionality. These gloves feature the same high quality craftsmanship, performance and durability that has made us industry leaders. Need help deciding which gloves to get? The most common recommendation is the 12 oz size (equivalent to� medium�). Young ladies or kids (over 10 years of age) should go with 8 oz boxing gloves. If you plan on using your gloves for power shots or heavy-bag use, we suggest grabbing the 14 oz sizeI purchased these after using generic gloves for years (the ones you get with your membership at kickboxing gyms) and Everlast. I noticed that the instructor had these gloves, so I figured they must be legit. These seem bulkier than my Everlast, but then again those seemed strangely small. Also, I got the 14 oz for a better workout, whereas my previous pairs were 12, so that could be why, too. I can tell these are good quality and will hold up nicely. For reference, I use them for kickboxing workout classes, not actual boxing. *I will update on durability after a few months.* I like these enough to recommend the brand to my mom, who needed new gloves because her Everlast were falling apart, too. She ordered a different color and they are so cute, I�m jelly. I particularly like that these come in so many cute colors.I have only recently taken up kickboxing but I love it and decided to get a membership and wanted my own gloves. I have small but wide hands so I wanted a smaller glove but still with weight to it. I checked with my gym and the recommended 12oz for women (that's what I was using there). I have used these about 3x now and I definitely love them. Color is fantastic, love the mesh carry bag as well (also fit my wraps in there). I would order these again, only reason not 5 stars is bc I cannot speak to durability yet. If you have very long hands/fingers these may be snug for you.Love them! They are still holding great after 7 monthsLove these gloves! I bought them for the color but they are functional as well. I am a beginner boxer and do bag work . Perfect for my class .lots of compliments too!These gloves are perfect for someone with smaller hands. They come inside/with a carrying case. The only problem I had was how long it took to ship after I purchased them. I do recommend buying wraps to wear underneath. It will help with spacing in the gloves and protects your wrists. They have the perfect amount of padding for punching/ heavy bag work. I take MMA three days a week and they haven�t shown any wear and tear so far.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Narrower silhouette for female hands
-Contours around hand for snug fit
-Eye-catching pastel color palette
-Sleek, sophisticated design with matte finish
-Same high quality craftsmanship, performance and durability as other Sanabul products

-May be too snug for women with longer fingers/hands",38

After 3 days a freak storm with very high winds blew through when we were not home. Though I had taken extra steps to secure the canopy to my deck and house, the winds got under it and pulled up and over the deck. All steel pieces were intact. The attachment points at each leg were broken in several places. The customer service staff went above and beyond in supplying me with new legs and a canopy to make repairs. Fabulous customer service! Lesson learned. Dont just lower the frame before a pending high wind storm, take off the canopy. Its so easy to take off and put back on.The Phi Villa straight Leg Instant Canopy is a pretty sweet product. It has a roll bag for easier transport and is pretty simple to set up as long as you have two people for set up. I did it by myself and it took about 15 min to do on my own.

Text: Nominal Size: 16 x 20 x 1, Actual Size: 15 1/2 x 19 1/2 x 3/4 (15.5 x 19.5 x 0.75). Measure your air filter for the exact size and compare it to our actual size to ensure proper fit.. Ideal for high efficiency air filtration and will help those with moderate allergies and asthma.. Nordic Pure MERV 12 is equivalent to MPR 1500-1900. Made in the USAIt was time to reorder some 16x20x1 filters, and I noticed that the six pack I'd normally buy was EXTREMELY expensive. While I like the performance of the other product, I figured it was worth looking into alternatives. The first problem: what's a suitable alternative? There are multiple performance rating systems for HVAC filters. MERV vs MPR? I had to find a chart online to find out that MERV 14 to 16 was roughly equivalent to the MPR 2200.So... how are the Nordic Pure 16x20x1 MERV 14 Plus Carbon Pleated AC Furnace Air Filters? My first impressions of the construction were positive. The framing is relatively rigid (when compared with lower quality filters). The filter material seems pretty substantial, and the backing carbon filter is similar to what you'll find on good, multi-stage air purifiers (4 or 5 stage).So there are a couple problems:1.) Despite the quantitative filter performance being slightly worse than the filters I'm replacing, the flow rate is lower. Using a spring gage and clip from the middle of the center pleat, I measured around a 2.5 (sig figs, natch) Nm DIFFERENCE in force from normal. Everyone's system pressure is different, but more force against the filter at the same filter performance isn't good. It goes directly into the next problem....2.) The filter is dimensionally smaller than EVERY OTHER 16x20x1 filter I've used!!! This one seems especially odd, considering that there's a standard for this type of thing. The air return filter doors I use are pretty normal, builder-grade stuff. Generally speaking, the filters are a tight fit, with the exposed screw heads providing the ""bite"" that holds the filters in place. These filters are a little over 1/4"" smaller in length and width. I had to use cardboard from the shipping box to make corner shims. This is a bigger deal than you might think. It's not just inconvenient if your filters are parallel to the floor, it's also working against the idea of having a good filter in the first place. While a good filter can deal with odors and allergens, the primary function is to keep the coil clean. The filter isn't doing that well if it's easy for air to bypass the filter. Upon installing my filters (I have 4 at this size, every replacement), I noticed whistling - which is the sound of bypass air. I really haven't had that problem before. Normally, I tape the filter into the frame, since it's just cheap insurance. In this case, it's ABSOLUTELY necessary. The low flow rate and undersized frame make the shims and tape non-optional, in my opinion.As far as the filter performance goes, it's fine. I went from some of the best (and most expensive) filters you can buy, to these - the understanding being that there would probably be some tradeoff in performance. As a filter, it seems to function pretty well (once you've addressed the fitment issues). The decrease in flow rate impacts your HVAC system pressure. I doesn't make a huge difference for me since I have enough AC units that each one is only covering about 1300sq, however YMMV. Looking over this, it probably sounds like I'm extremely critical abou the product, but I'm excited about the carbon filter. While my old filters supposedly are impregnated with carbon material in the filter fabric, the Nordic Pure approach seems more substantial. Being in a multi-dog household, it's hard to say if it's more effective, but it's at least as good, so that's a plus!I'm a huge believer in good air quality. You take at least 10 breaths a minute, after all. Quality air filters should be a priority, even though there can be some sticker shock for ""good"" ones. However, that doesn't mean that you don't hit diminishing returns and declining value at some point. If you aren't put off by the two cons listed above, the Nordic Pure filters should work for you. It's a little more messy, but you should tape your filter frames (IMO) - and it's ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY with these filters. Conditionally recommended.MERV is the international standard for rating filters like these. The MERV scale goes up to 16 (as of this review) and 13 is the highest rating for residential use. The difference between MERV12/13 for residential use is negligible and some older furnaces may have trouble with MERV 11+ filters anyways. This is because the higher the rating, the thicker the filter and the harder your furnace has to work to pass air through it. MERV 12 will filter out just about everything save for the smallest particulates (I.E Bacteria/Viruses and Smoke). With added carbon filtering to a MERV 8+ it is possible to filter out smoke/bacteria (NOT Viruses though) but the product in question (MERV 12 pleated, no carbon) does not have added carbon filtering.Overall, with the amount you're getting and the MERV rating for these filters, this value (40USD for x6) is stellar. Filtrete way over charges for their similarly rated MPR (their own unit of measurement) filters. Keep the filters in a dust free environment (in the box) before use. They are not individually wrapped. This is not a problem if they are adequately stored.I live in an apartment on the 3rd floor. The place is a you-know-what-hole and I don't plan on staying after lease is up in a few months. I was using Filtrete filters, but they were so rigid that I actually had to bend the filter slightly to get them to fit into the duct. I was also having trouble justifying the price per filter since my apartment may as well be open air it is so poorly insulated.I got a box of 6 of these filters for roughly 30 dollars from Amazon Warehouse and they are very quality and easily comparable to the Filtrete brand. I am extremely satisfied with the price per filter compared to Filtrete; almost 2 to 1.I also thought that the thick cardboard box they are shipped in was great because it is great for protecting the remaining filters in my closet until they are needed; a problem I always have when buying the #M filters, which are just wrapped in plastic when I purchase from Costco.Best home air filter you can get. It's MERV 12 so it filters out everything but cigarette smoke. But get a MERV 14 or better filter and you can (15 is hosptal grade and 16 is what they use in surgery rooms). I don't smoke in my home (I don't smoke, period) so it would be overkill for me. If you do smoke and have a 13+ you will notice a difference in the air quality even though you will still have orange walls from the nicotine. This filter gets all the danders, pollens, molds, spores, whatevers, and traps them in this filter. If you have allergies, YOU NEED ONE OF THESE FILTERS! Especially if you get congested at night. I live in a low humidity high pollen area and this air filter has been wonderful. This isn't the standard run of the mill blue screen dollar store air filter. This is high quality and sturdy. The filters come in a 6pk, and last about 2 months each. Meaning you can go 1 year breathing easy through your nose with this purchase. Like I said before, if you have allergies and you don't have a MERV 12 filter. You're living life wrong. Your home should be your sanctuary from the allergens. Yeah if you go outside, you should need your allegra but not in your home. If you buy these filters, you will not regret it. You have to breathe to live... lol Why not have the best air possible in your home and have a sanctuary you can actually breathe deeply in? Best money I've ever spent. Would give 999 stars if I could. Here's a link to a MERV rating chart so you can compare to see what best fits your needs : [...]I did a lot of research before ordering these filters. The apartment that I moved into had a filter that was so dirty, it was falling apart when I took it out of the HVAC. Nordic Pure air filters were highly recommended by a number of websites and they do not disappoint! The improvement was immediate and I am glad I purchased them.Pro's:","Pro's:

Stronger jack, but I�m sure for smaller lifting it will do just fine!I wanted to rotate my tires. The jack stands were too tall to fit my Ford Focus Electric. I had to jack the car higher than necessary. Otherwise, great price for the combination. I bought a used set from Amazon Warehouse. The jack manual was for a 2-1/2 ton jack, but it was fine for the 2 ton jack.The jack stand themselves are just fine and will work exactly how they are meant to. The jack itself is another story. The biggest problem is that the jack doesn�t lift a car high enough to fit the jack stands under. It�s a very very short jack stand and with the height of most cars it won�t be enough. If you have a truck or suv you might not even be able to get a single wheel off the ground. Would not recommend.

Actual Frame size (finished size) is 18.5x26.5 inches and the frame is 1.5 inches wide. Please Note: Actual color and wood grain may vary depending on the cut of wood and wood color.. An eye catching blue wash finish gives this frame character and a casual rustic charm that is right on trend. Slight ridges and breaks in its periwinkle rub, showcases natural wood and traditional craftsmanship that blends perfectly with any space. A lovely accent in any room, this frame pairs well with family photos, eclectic prints and is great for gifting at housewarming parties, baby showers and at family events.Nice looking frame. It says glass and it is glass. Heavy but good.Beautiful frame that works perfectly with the picture.Some said in their reviews that their frame was glass; others said plexiglass. For a little over $40 for one frame, I expected GLASS! No, I got plexiglass, which had streaks and pull marks upon arrival. Also, the wood was stained much lighter than the sample pic (green). And...the corners don�t align well. It feels really lightweight and since I bought 2, it was NOT worth over $80. I feel I could have bought something similar for $19.99. Definitely feel ripped off. I bought them because of the size I needed and it�s for kinda sophisticated prints, not a kids poster or something going in a �fun playroom.� This is actually going in a dining room and now I�m going to have to denote them to kidsRtejrk, complete with streaked plexiglass and uneven corners. Sigh.Matches the subtle, green in my Hawaiian hula prints perfectly. I am glad I searched for these.Clearly NOT 1.5� thick, in fact, it�s exactly HALF that @3/4� which was useless for us! We bought what was advertised as a blue frame, and this was gray with NO blue in it at all. It was well packed though, but even with that there was a chip along the edge of the glass� Processing a return now and shopping elsewhere� Disappointed�Pro's:","Pro's:

VEGAN PROTEIN POWDER: USDA Organic, NSF Certified Gluten Free, Certified Vegan, Kosher and Informed Choice Trusted by Sport - delicious with water or unsweetened almond milkLast year I weighed over 200 pounds, was on 8 meds, have arthritis, crushed disks and was pre diabetic, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, ugh!!! I was tired all the time. Doctor after doctor told me I was old (60), women gain weight, I had a lot of injuries, I needed to accept that I should have surgery on my neck, back and knees. They really wanted to do surgery. I almost did, but a friend of mine had back surgery with a top doctor in the country, and she came out of worse, could barely move for months! I was scared to death! I got this protien powder to make another attempt to be healthier, but I was very depressed that expensive doctors were basically telling me my life was over. I had always been so athletic when young, I did not think I could go on. I was also on tons of opiates they prescribed. A nightmare! Last June, we had five unexpected deaths in our family, and then my beloved chow/wolf dog mix died suddenly (she was very old). I could not eat, I could not sleep. Food was like sawdust. I literally lost my sense of taste! The only thing i found i could tolerate was this powder blended in milk and ice. I just drank that once or twice a day, and ate almost nothing else. This protien powder kept me from really getting sick, because I was getting enough to go on. I started to lose weight, over this whole last year. I cold turkey quit all the pain meds and got kratom, cbd oil and lettuce pills, that helped my pain without addiction or feeling weird. Then I found my knees weren't hurting anymore. I began to walk at the lake track near us every day, just to get out. I still had the protien shake with plain milk every day. Finally I went in for a check up at the doctor and my weight set off alarms, I had lost over a hundred pounds! They gave me tests for everything. My blood pressure was perfect, my cholesterol was perfect, I had no sign of diabetes. I had gone from a size 16 to a size 4. I hadn't even been hungry! The protien shake kept me from craving sugar since it had none, and I just stopped eating a lot. I felt better with a lot less in my stomach. At the lake i walked, feeling light and free for the first time in YEARS. I felt so light i started to run, i never ran, but suddenly, i found i could, it felt better than walking. It didn't hurt my back or neck, my knees felt great, i felt like crying, all this time I had listened to professionals tell me I was too old, too fat and too late to change anything. Through a series of odd events, I found some answers, and a new freedom. I've been running every day ever since. I LOVE IT! I feel like a ten year old. I feel pain free and happy when I run. Some of my childhood has returned in the feelings of hope and possibilities again.I'm training to run barefoot, my feet have strong arches again. Read the book, ""Born To Run"" and you'll discover how to stay free from injury and healthy without killing yourself or straining to be ""perfect"". To just enjoy it. If I can do this, at 60, after being told there was no hope, then maybe this will help another person to feel the same. Never, ever give up! Don't stop looking for answers and solutions, even if you are told there aren't any. Look into the healthy diets of people on Crete, dump sugar and snacks and get this powder, start feeling better! It really, really helps you get lighter and healthier without cravings. Take time and change your life a little every day. Every single day you can try again, make another effort, let go of your mistakes and start over, relax and trust that it's truly possible.I am a busy mom of two small children and a personal fitness trainer of 12 years with a degree in Exercise Science/Kinesiology. I am NOT a fan of Skakology or most other protein powders/shakes due to both quality/nutritional concerns and price. We are a dairy free family and I also do not endorse the use of zero calorie sweeteners such as Stevia. I believe in moderate use of real and natural sugars to sweeten things.I'm really excited about what I found at Wegmans this week! Garden of Life's RAW Organic Protein and Greens Powder with Probiotics/Enzymes!!! I got the vanilla kind without Stevia. I have been looking for an organic, but dairy and Stevia free option for years and now it finally exists! It mixes fairly smooth without a blender and tastes great. I personally don't find it very gritty at all. I add cocoa powder and a little honey. Or you can blend it with banana, peanut butter, and ice (my husband and kid's favorite). You have no idea how thrilled I am about this discovery. I've been having a very hard time getting enough protein and greens into my little picky eaters.Anyway, I'm currently 5 weeks out from my 3rd c-section so I'm starting to pack my hospital bag. And what was the first thing I thought about packing??? Food, of course. LOL. The food at my hospital was actually pretty tasty, BUT seriously lacking in the nutritional value I'm accustomed to. They keep you there for at least 3 days and I felt I needed much more proteins and greens while trying to nurse and recover from surgery. So here is my solution - I'm packing homemade protein shake powder and nuts with dried fruit.Here is what I did to make a super power packed shake for only about $2 per serving (that's still way less than the popular Skakology drinks).I prepped plastic baggies with the following...- 1 scoop of RAW Organic Protein & Greens Powder- 1 Tablespoon collagen powder (great for your joints & connective tissue especially when healing from birth or injury)- 1 scoop Organic Wheatgrass Power (extra veggies/nutrients can't hurt!)- 1 Tablespoon Cocoa powder (also good for you!)Then (at the hospital) I'll simply add 10 oz of unsweetened Almond Milk with calcium (the non-refrigerated kind for convenience), a little organic honey, and a few ice cubes (they make it cold and help to mix it up better), in a blender bottle and shake.Whoohoo! SO good. You have got to try this.I loved pretty much everything about it - the ingredients, nutritional content, taste - however after about a week of having consumed it I developed severe fatigue and strange aches throughout my body. Upon further research one of the ingredients have been linked to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) which include the symptoms I mentioned. This may not affect everyone but for those with more sensitive symptoms, be careful.First of i really do love Garden of LIFE protein and GREENS SHAKE or majority of there shakesONLY WHEN THEY COME FROM GARDEN OF LIFE COMPANY, THIS PRODUCT IS A CHINA REMAKE,TASTE NOTHING LIKE THE REAL ONE, SHAMEI found this powder to be quite expensive for what it was. I have a high speed blender ( 33,000 RPM ) and when doing smoothies with it - I could still taste the powdery tecture, so I limited the amount I used and could still sense a powdery texture, which is not too nice in a smoothie. I have bought Garden Of Life Products many times before and they're clearly a permium company because the ingridients are very clean.So, very expensive for what it is. Good clean ingriedients, except for the ""natrual flavours"" which is not clean. It's highly unlikey I'll be buying again.Pro's:","Pro's:

I rated it 4-star for sturdiness because the cardboard backing is thin - but we made it work. I purchased some 18 x 24 prints and these frames make the prints look like high-end art!!!Absolute trash. The backing is thin cardboard. On the first frame I checked, the metal tab gouged the cardboard.The frame has unsightly gaps in the corners which may not be fixable given the tabs are not right in the corner.The frame corners are not tight and reveal their mdf nature with some peeling and black gaps.I�ve literally never seen a frame with a cardboard backer before. Every other frame I�ve seen (even crap made in China frames) have had a hardboard backer.I�m torn whether to keep these and fix the issues or go through the hassle of figuring out how to repack them.Save yourself the trouble and pass on these frames. If you want bottom of the barrel frames there are cheaper options. If you want nice frames, these are not nice.I frame puzzles. This was perfect.**FIRST OF ALL** I�m seeing some reviews about the cardboard backing and the metal prongs on the back:1- the the cardboard is irrelevant. All it does is add protection and padding behind your art.2- you�re supposed to press the metal prongs into the cardboard backing once you insert your art, so that it stays tight and secure. Some people really need to learn how to use frames and it shows.I�ve never been into �art� or decorating my living space until recently. A few months ago, I discovered Nashid Chroma on tiktok (artists name and dot com for website) and saw these incredibly beautiful prints. I decided to get four powerhouse women for my office space, all in 16x20 size. They for sure ?? needed a frame to do them justice. ??I had heard about the cost of getting art and prints professionally framed and dreaded the expense, time, and energy of going that route. I decided to look up frames on Amazon, and was skeptical when I found these. However, despite the �cheap cardboard on the back�, these are incredibly fair-priced. I opted for the white matted frames for these prints, as the rest of my home office is mostly white/pink/gray. Worst case scenario I return them?I was blown away. They are incredibly sturdy, beautiful quality, and had instructions on how to install the wiring for hanging on the wall. Very pleasantly surprised and happy with my first attempt at self-framing. (Also I did it all solo, so you can too, independent babes.)Highly recommend. ??????????These frames are beautiful. Came packaged as described. All my parts came as well.

Consult your device specifications or look for the microSHXC logo on your host devices for compatibilityThis review is for the 256GB sd card. This card was about $10 cheaper than other cards of this size, and I've been burned before, so I decided to test it. Attached are screenshots of my tests using 2 different software (fakeFlashTest, and h2testw_1.4). I only did the quick test in fakeFlashTest, but I did the long test using h2testw_1.4. This card passed both, so i am happy with my purchase. The speeds show 10.4MB/s write and 15.5MB/s read.The SD card works fine, but the package for the product (not the shipping package) was covered in teriyaki sauce.For $8.99, this 32GB twin pack is a steal when it comes to capacity and performance. They both work without issue and are nearly identical in performance. A 1GB file transfer from PC to MicroSD card in 32 seconds is not bad for $4.50. I bought these primarily just to swap out my older 8GB cards to add storage capacity in my Roku Ultra and Samsung phone. Reportedly, Micro Center uses sub standard ""doped"" silicon in order to be a cheaper alternative to the consumer. Well, regardless, these are good cards that have consistent write speeds on large file transfers with reasonably good latency for a budget SD card. Taking HD Video and High-Res pictures on the phone is smooth with no glitches. Don't skip over Micro Center assuming their products will be junk because of the cheap price tag. I typically use SanDisk or ADATA for SDCards or USB FD, but I think I found a cheap viable alternative.

Text: Efficiently cleans and filters water. Easy to install using suction cups and/or hanging clips. Auto-start pump requires no priming, automatically restarts if power is interrupted and restored. On average, change filter cartridge every 4 weeks. Carbon Cartridge included for chemical filtration; removes odors and discoloration from water. Bioholster included to foster biological filtration which removes toxic ammonia and nitrites. Coarse Media Sponge included for mechanical filtration; removes particles and debrisI used this to make my own cat ( or dog) water bowl filter. Works great, and *WAY* cheaper than the proprietary pet bowl water fountain / bowls you can buy. I got the plastic container at Costco, but any restaurant support store will do. Just make sure it is deep enough and square in shape.I have a 20 gallon reef tank with tonsss of live rock which already serves as a filration for my tank. This is why i bought the 10 gallon version. Filtration is not why i bought this. I bought this because my phosphates were high and i the treatment i'd use for it requires a hang on back filter. My canopy does not allow hang on back filter so i had to look for a internal filter. I disliked the tetra whispers and all the other internal filters just because they were either too long/big or didn't have enough space inside to actually put in the treatment bag inside. Until i found this! Within 10 minutes of installing my water became crystal clear especially from the surface of the water (which was oily brown and dirty because of my reef tank) i love this filter, it's short but big enough to put media inside/ treatment bags. Definetly recommend! If it works amazinv in a reef tank, it'd work wonders in a freshwater tank, also flow is not too high which is perfect didn't disrupt the flow too much for my corals!!! (:nanThe review criteria is asking for this black plastic pump's ""sheerness"". Like can I see through it? No, no I cannot but I think I can potentially live with that, so five stars for its sheerness. It's also asking for me to rate ""suction power"". Can it empty a bathtub in under a minute? No, but this thing is tiny. So a generous five stars for suction power. Also I'm being asked about its noise level. Again, tiny, not much vacuum, so mouse quiet. Five stars for noise level.Sheerness... sheesh.My brother won some goldfish at the carnival and brought them home for me so I needed to throw together a fish tank very quickly. After doing a lot of research and recognizing that goldfish require very good filtration, I chose this filter. I was originally going to get one of the smaller ones, but I needed it to have mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration so I went for the filter that works in tanks up to 10 gallons. I have it in a 5 gallon tank right now. When I first put it in, it created a strong current that moved the marimo balls and made it so my fish couldn't swim. However, after letting it sit in the tank overnight, there have been no problems at all with creating a strong current.The filter is a decent size. Pretty big for a 5 gallon tank, but not so big that it takes much away from the decor or the fishs' swimming space. The important thing is it has so far done an amazing job of keeping my tank's water clean! My fish seem very happy and the water remains crystal clear every day, even under the aquarium lights. The suction cups that keep it attached to the glass are really strong and are holding up well. I haven't had to wash it yet, but just from setting it up I can tell it'll be easy to clean it and replace the carbon filter. I recommend the 10-gallon filter for anyone with a tank 5 to 10 gallons (maybe even as low as 3 or 4 gallons, but definitely no smaller than that).Pro's:","Pro's:

Basic, but made of solid wood and not cheap-looking. The �glass� is acrylic, which I was aware of before purchasing. Most ready-made frames in this size range use acrylic for reduced weight and fragility. However� I was specifically looking for a frame with a mat for a photograph that is 11� x 15� - an odd size. A custom-cut mat can cost as much as this inexpensive frame and it�s a hassle to go to a frame shop, choose the mat and possibly have to come back at a later date to pick it up. OR I could cut it myself. I have the knowledge and tools but since I only cut a few per year for the odd piece of my own work that doesn�t fit a standard size I�m not great at it. I end up messing up 1 out of 4, on average. Mat board isn�t cheap so I defer to the standard sizes when possible.So I was relieved to find a few frames here that claimed to be matted for 11 x 15�. Of the few I found this one looked to be the best quality. Disappointingly, the mat opening is too big at 11-1/4� x 15-1/8�. Not sure what size art or photo is supposed to fit in that - I assume it corresponds to a European standard size. My photo floats freely in the opening of this useless mat. It�s not worth returning so I�ll go ahead and cut my own mat, and possibly a finger (it�s happened).The frame is ridiculous. Normally I buy cheap frames for my artwork that I gift to keep it protected until the person frames it how they want. This time I wanted better presentation and went for a little more expensive frame. This frame is barely a frame. I don't care if it's glass or plexi, just as long as it covers and protect. This plexi has something similar to saran wrap. It's so thin it wants to push through. I looked at it wrong and scratched it with my fingernail. As soon as the protective cover was peeled off, it had a kind of static cling that attracted all the dust. I had to frame and unframed 5 times to get the dust off of the plastic. And the matting was 1/4 inch bigger than it was supposed to be all the way around, leaving a gap around my painting. It was supposed to be 11x15. It is a solid 11.25 x 15.25.I bought this frame for my diploma. It fits very well. Very lightweight but sturdy. I had another frame, but the glass broke when I moved to a different city after my graduation. This one is a lot better with the plastic clear cover. It looks no different than a glass cover. The downside is that there is no back support leg � it can only be leaned on something or hung on a wall. But again, I wanted a wood frame with a durable cover, this one matches my requirements. I�m satisfied.The acrylic plastic front covering is not sized properly, thin and has a crack right in the middle of the edge. Poorly painted. The frame is so light weighted and made by cheap material, solid wood can�t be that light. Overpriced. You can easily find a better one for $30 in homegoods. Not sure where the 5 stars review come from.I ordered these together to hang perfectly side by side. One frame has a single hanging point (better to tweak for level) the other one has 2? Both while hanging vertically. This was an enormous pain to hang these and they�re cheap wood and plastic instead of glass. Save your moneyPro's:","Pro's:

An industry-leading 5-year limited warranty | See official Western Digital website for warranty details.I oversee technology for an entire school and have done so for over a decade. For my professional and personal usage I only purchase the WD Black Hard Drives and I have literally never had a problem or failure with any of them during that entire 12 year period. So, that's all I continue to buy. I used to purchase another brand name drive but we had problems with them. There's nothing worse than having a hard drive crap out taking all the data with it. Granted we usually have back ups but there's always the gnawing feeling that something gets lost when restoring from backup no matter how frequent the backups. Plus there's the stress, frustration, and lost productivity while the unit is offline.Yes, these drives are more expensive than many other hard drives. However, when you factor in the dramatically improved reliability and longevity, it has been my experience that they are more than worth the extra money.To be sure, there's no doubt that there may be an occasional bad unit or one that just fails, but, so far, in my experience we have never encountered one. Plus, they have a 5 year warranty and a high MTBF rating both of which, of course, are very reassuring.Side note: if you're not backing up your data to some sort of disconnected storage device and you lose data that's not the fault of the drive or the malware that took out your data. In my experience, there are two kinds of people in the world: those who have lost data and those who will lose data.I initially purchased this hard drive for my top of the line custom PC build. I had an expert put together my PC (i9 9900K, RTX 2080TI, Two 2 TB NVMe 970 EVO SSD's, MSI MEG Z390 ACE MB). Initially when I brought the PC home, everything was fine. This WD hard drive was storing a couple TB of my gaming clips and I had no complaints.After a week or so, I noticed my HDD was no longer listed in my drive list. I troubleshot the issue and wasn't able to figure out what was wrong. I gave up for a few days and noticed that all of the sudden, the hard drive was back in my list of drives. I hadn't done anything I know of to cause this. This off-an-on appearance of the drive happened several times until I contacted the professional who put together my PC - he told me that it was a defective drive and to return it for a replacement.I did this and received the same HDD as a replacement item. Almost immediately after installing the new HDD I noticed once again that it wasn't appearing in my list of available drives. Again it began to show up sporadically.At this point I figured it must be a problem with my setup or some other faulty component. I troubleshot this issue EXTENSIVELY. It finally came to the point where I completely uninstalled everything and installed a brand new motherboard myself.I was very excited to see that after I plugged everything in and booted up, my hard drive was listed in my drives. I had thought I fixed the issue, but then the next day the drive had disappeared again.I've taken the computer to 3 different experts to help troubleshoot my issue and they've all claimed that this is a faulty drive and that all other components are functioning properly.I reached out to request a refund for the faulty drive that I have been sent (twice) and the company is now refusing to assist me with my issue.I would be VERY cautious ordering this item as from what I've seen, it's very probable that the components being sold are old, damaged, reused, or faulty in some way.Once upon a time I made the mistake of trying out the cheaper seagate sshd desktop models because it promised faster speeds and more storage for the price of wd black. Currently going through the tedious rma process of that drive which was used in a machine extremely infrequently until anything I tried to save on it kept giving me a disk read error.Switched back to wd black which Ive used for years in other desktops to replace that. Id rather stick to the 7200rpm black model and used a ssd for a boot drive than touch another seagate again. I didnt want to believe all the issues people said about seagate but wow they were not kidding.Normally I don't have issue with western digital drives. I happened to get one that was DOA. Return process seemed fine, until I got my hard drive mailed back to me indicating that they took no action. The cited reason, ""damage"". Now I don't know about you, but I handle my drives very carefully, and I followed all of their instructions. The only mark I can see is a very very small crack in the plastic that would easily go unnoticed by any one not looking for it. At the same time, the reason why I was RMAing the drive was due to the fact that IT DIDN'T WORK. I have no doubt in my mind that they could have replaced the damaged piece since its part of the board, but it was easier for them to just say, ""Nope"" and return it back to me. If i ever bother to buy these drives again, I will be scrutinizing them with a fine toothed comb because the reasons for not backing their product are in this case ridiculous.nanPro's:","Pro's:

And the nylon feet of pinch free adjustable legs protect your patio and deck surfaces no matter where you set the tent canopy/pop up gazebo.. Super strong double truss one piece frame with full awnings comes completely assembled. And the eaves can be automatically extending when open the pop up gazebo opens without any additional manual assembly. The leg-covers add a touch-of-elegance for all those special occasions.. Stay relax and safe from the sun�s damaging rays under the UPF 50+ UV protected 13x13 canopy top, made of rugged heat-reflective fabric, but also flame resistant and water repellent. 2 Grommets located on each side edge to ensure water drainage and to prevent pooling. And two tier vented top allows a great air flow to make you feel cool under tis patio gazebo.. Roller bag bonus come with this yard canopy-Storage bag features fast rolling heavy duty wheels, and webbing handles for lifting or rolling. With 55*9.64*9.64 inch dimensions, this bag easily fits in most vehicles. Specialized pocket to hold included 4 ground stakes, 4 super stakes and 4 guy ropes.ATTENTION: This canopy product is designed primarily for seasonal shade and to offer protection from damage caused by the sun, light rain, tree sap, and bird excrement.I thought I ordered a smaller size of this canopy. It turned out to be a better value for the money. It's made very well, more substantial than previous canopies, and color worked well on my patio.Easy to setup, just needed to retighten some of the screws that were loose. All in all I�m well satisfied with this purchase for now. Only time will tell if this will last at least 3 yrs. I ended up using this as my backyard shade, bolted it on the slab and once in a while pluck it out and carry it with me to the beach.The first time this was delivered by FedEx, it was actually taken to a neighboring building. Weeks later, a neighbor walked it over but prior to that, I presumed it had been stolen. The company was very responsive in helping me get another one and helping me return the original when it was discovered not stolen after all. Unusually positive customer service experience.Used for the first time in the rain last night. Easier to set up than I was anticipating. No problem with two people. Probably could do with one, more slowly but still possible. Kept us dry and even a little warm, with more than enough room to safely distance.I use the canopy for shade at our model airplane flying field. Also use it in my backyard for temporary shade. Seems to work better than the ABC canopy as I had two defective one from them. Very easy to put up and take down as it�s a one person operation.I bought this for my pop up art exhibit. It�s super easy to put up. Looks super pretty. I worry when it�s windy because the bars aren�t too thick, but so far ok. The vent helps. Overall really pleased.Pro's:","Pro's:

Please contact us freely for any question and we promise you 100% satisfaction.Wow these frames are terrible! First off I ordered two of the same thing at the same time (10 x 10 matted to 6 x 6), and I got two totally different sizes shipped in the mail (see photo). Second, the frame that was supposedly the same size as I ordered actually isn't. I ordered a 10 x 10 and what showed up was an 11 x 11 (see photo). Third, the quality is not good. The front of one of them was dinged up on arrival and the other one the little pegs on the back of the frame won't all fit in the way they're supposed to, only half of them work. The cheap frames at Walmart are better quality - just go with that if you need something inexpensive - I'm returning mine.I have no idea why they didn't just include some clips on the back that we could attach wire or string to on our own. The ""seamless"" hanger has this one tiny piece of plastic you're supposed to attach the picture to. The weight of the picture bears down directly on this ridiculously flimsy piece. The first one broke immediately, leaving this white lump of a ""seamless"" hanger nailed in by three micro nails, all embedded in the wall with no way to get them out because they were hammered flush into the ""seamless"" hanger. I will keep putting ""seamless"" in quotation marks because there was nothing seamless about this project. So in trying to pull the broken ""seamless"" hanger out of our wall, we damaged the wall (of course). And I don't see much of a way that was to be avoided. We then tried again with the second ""seamless"" hanger, which held the picture for all of 32 second before smashing to the floor with the prized work of art in it. Thanks a lot. Just please for the love of the Lord put normal hanging hardware on this thing. Sometimes the wheel works just fine -- and what you reinvented in this instance is a supreme step down. I will go back to cleaning shards off my floor now.Apparently a 10"" x 14"" inch frame is difficult to come by. I went to Michael's, Joann's, and those are really my only two go-to frame places, but they didn't have one this size. This was a problem because I had a sweet piece of art I wanted to display but couldn't because of the slightly strange size. I took out the matting, and my poster fits perfectly. The frame itself feels rather cheap, and up close isn't perfect, but for how much trouble finding the right size is and at this price, this frame did what I needed it to do.Not A4 size. I have a few A4 prints and other frames. This frame did not fit any of my A4 prints. It�s a little too small and only works if you�re willing to cut your prints, which I am not. Also, I hadn�t realized it didn�t come with a bracket to mount on the wall, so it�s also only good if you wanted to rest this on a table or other surface. Who wants to rest such a large frame on a side table/coffee table? Returning.I recently purchased a piece of original colored sketch art. The artist resides in Finland, where the typical sheet of paper is A4-sized - 8.3 x 11.7 inches. The 8.3"" isn't too far off the 8.5"" for an American letter-sized sheet, but the 11.7"" length is problematic. This holder does the job nicely, and it's versatile in being able to either hang or rest on a surface. The one slight problem was it was hard to remove the protective backings off of the acrylic, so I had to carefully shallow-cut into it with a knife to get it to start. An extremely minor thing, though. Definitely a must for displaying A4-sized art.Pro's:","Pro's:

It is an ideal companion for daily commutes and weekends with ample room and it fits up to 15.6"" laptop or tablet, files, a wallet, sunglasses, a phone, makeups and so onSo first let me say that I been searching for perfect laptop bag that will also fit my binder and personal stuff and this bag is the perfect fit! Definitely recommend to buy if you searching for a cute bag that will go with you professional outfits or even in your most causal attired!!! This bag came in with a protective cover nicely you can tell the seller takes care of his/her product. It came just as it stated in the description nothing was missing. The color is so beautiful ??!!! I�m so happy that I finally found the perfect bag to do my student teaching with and head to my college classes at night!! So don�t think about twice buy the bag you won�t regret it!!!I originally gave this product two stars because the strap broke within 2 weeks of using it. However, I was not only refunded the money, but received a brand new bag with improvements to the straps to ensure they do not break. This is what customer experience looks like. I would give 10 stars if I could. Great company and great product. Love this bag!!Update 12/15/18: I've been using this bag two days per week for work and school for the past 4 months and it's held up great. No wear or tear or issues of any kind. Highly recommended!I�m starting grad school in the fall and I wanted something I can fit an iPad, notebook, and books in, along with my phone, wallet, and everything else I usually keep in my purse, so I can use it as an all-in-one bag when I go straight to class after work. I wanted something that was classy and convenient. This is definitely the right bag! I was extremely impressed by the packaging when I received the shipment and even more impressed when I opened it. The color is beautiful and the workmanship makes this look like a bag that would cost three times as much as it does. I love the option to adjust the straps and wear this as a purse or to add the shoulder strap and carry it like a laptop bag. I am extremely happy with my purchase and can�t wait to start using this bag!I highly recommend this product. It is well-made, beautiful, sleek, and sturdy. My laptop fits nicely and securely in this bag along with personal items which are normally stored in pouches. On days where I bring minimal items, I tend to randomly toss in keys, a chapstick/ lip gloss, the work badge, sunglasses, a planner and an ID card case. I will admit, it's not easy trying to find smaller items floating around at the bottom. The interior color is the only dislike. I wish the manufacturer would have used a different interior color; either hot pink, blush pink, powder blue, silver or a pattern like polka dots. Other than that, the shoulder strap and top handles are still in good condition. The zippers pull nicely. I'm still enjoying this laptop bag!I absolutely loved my bag. It took me forever to find one that was roomy enough, but not too roomy for my work stuff. I have had it for a little over a month and today I guess it was picked up and just the right weak spot and the handle ripped right off, and I didn�t have too much in there for it to be too heavy. Like I said I loved the product but disappointed in life expectancy.Pro's:","Pro's:

Ideal for photography and videography enthusiasts and for recording and transferring content between devices and computer. Compatible with point & shoot cameras DSLR cameras standard & Advanced hd-enabled video cameras and more. Reliable & Durable: Magnet Proof, Shock Proof, Temperature Proof, WaterproofI meant to order a microSD but luckily I have card slots for both regular and microSD; this is the big boi card though! I haven't officially benchmarked this card but I was able to transfer a 500mb file through a USB-C SD hub in ~9 seconds, so even through a USB cord and SD hub it wrote at over 50MBps. I usually get about 1/5 of the read speeds for write speeds from SD so at half I'm not disappointed. This obviously isn't going to come close to a directly connected SSD for speed but it works fine for my Steam library and some video, I start backing up before I go to sleep so I'm honestly not sure how long large files take, but if you're someone who doesn't mind backing up overnight like me you really shouldn't notice anything negative about this card. At 50 MBps it theoretically should take less than an hour to fill but I have heard that larger files take longer to write relatively to smaller ones and I've never checked it once going to bed. Anyway, I recommend this card and I've considered buying only PNY products, they're dark and not flashy and pair well with my setup and they also work great. I was looking at some Corsair USB flash that looks crazy and flashy- the Corsair is faster but costs way more and looks too over the top and I honestly think only people trying to run Windows or games directly from their external memory solution would notice any sort of speed deficiency. This performs sufficiently for probably 90% of people at a good price. A Samsung T7 will get you theoretical 1gb write speeds but starts at 500gb for $130, I don't need 500gb and I don't need gig write speeds. Also, you can't use an SSD in a DSLR.I bought this during an Amazon deal to try out as a back up while on vacation, and its performance was unfortunately as bad as I expected from PNY. Despite formatting the card several times while in my camera, it would repeatedly fail to keep up while high speed continuous shooting - often causing my camera to pause after only 5-6 shots while writing. There's really no comparison to the similarly-spec'd Sandisk Extreme Pro (even the microSD version), which is only a few dollars more expensive. Sandisk's performance blows this out of the water. I won't shoot with this card again, and it will be designated for archive duties only.IN my opinion, the PNY SD card brand is the most relatable out there,All the other popular sd cards I had, failed after less than two years but never PNY.Either split into two. The lock broke, so I could not use it anymore or format.Get the PNY if you want a piece of mind.I've been in the professional tech field for most of my life, and PNY flash memory is a no-brainer. It's usually the least expensive, while still being well made and lasts longer than whatever device you put it in. You can't go wrong on this SDXC at this price and this size!It has been over a year since I bought 2 of these cards. I use a Canon Rebel T6 and a 6D Mark II to save my photos to.

[Support] Gigastone 5-year limited warrantyI have only used it with the Switch, so how it works for other devices, I couldn't tell you. In regard to the Switch, this sd card works great. No issues. I have nearly used the entire space provided on the card (only 8GB remaining), so this should tell you that it does its job. I trust and recommend it (for use with Switch).This thing is garbage. I bought it to go in my Fire TV Box but, it decided it didn't want the Fire TV to be able to read it anymore after less than a day so, I swapped it with the card I had in my phone since it seemed like my phone could read it. Well, the joke was on me because while my phone recognizes that it's there, it can't use it for anything at all.*Edit 10/16/18 - The company contacted me recently wanting to know if I was happy with my memory card and I told them about the issues I had had with it and I can only say that they have been nothing short of fantastic in trying to remedy the situation. They sent me a new card which is working great so far and they're also sending me a nice gift to compensate me for my trouble and lost files which I could not remove from the card.Given the situation as it stands now, I have to remove some of my previous comment and change my rating and recommendation, these guys are definitely worth a shot.I bought seven of these cards (128 GB), which come with a 5 year warranty. Within 10 weeks, three of them failed. I tried to contact Gigastone, only to find that the security certificate on their website had expired over a month before. I still tried to fill out the online form, only the submit button wasn't functioning. I tried in two other browsers with the same effect. So, I found an email address on the packaging and contacted the company.In a reasonable amount of time (maybe the next business day) I received a response. The email did not seem like it was written by a native English speaker, but I was able to fairly clearly determine that they wanted me to send them a picture of the cards that were not working to verify that they had not been physically abused. This seemed perfectly reasonable, so I took a picture and replied to the message I received, including an image attachment of the three cards that failed the day after that.After about a week or so, I had not heard a response from the company, so I sent another reply asking if they got my message, or if they needed any more information from me (more images, tests they wanted me to run, etc.). That was over a month ago and I still have not received a response nor any replacement cards. I ended up just buying new ones from another company. I would still like to get my replacements (the cards worked fine until they didn't, and the others still seem to be working without issue for now).I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I don't seem to hear anything from the company, so I think it's appropriate to share my experience here.Both cards in the pair worked for about a week or two, then began to go corrupt, causing a loss of data. Do not recommend. Buy a better product.**BUYER BEWARE** **RECEIVED DEFECTIVE CARD AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE**I bought these micro sd cards in July. Didn't use them right away but once I did I put the card into the adapter and into my laptop to transfer the data and it said that the card was locked. I went through all the steps... checking the card, the adapter, restarting the computer, I even researched it on Google and downloaded a few programs to unlock a locked sd card. Nothing worked. I couldn't return it because the return window had closed. I called Amazon who called Gigastone. The Gigastone rep told me to email them with pictures of the defective card. I did. I waited two weeks and didn't receive a response. I emailed again and still have not received a response after several weeks. Would NOT recommend.Pro's:","Pro's:

It is now almost 10:30. How am I supposed to recover my files if I can�t get in touch with the company?! - -I bought this on July 22, today is August 26. It lasted a month and a few days. I freelance and my computer doesn�t have the storage capacity for all the files I save and work on. Now I don�t have any of the files I created for my clients. This is a HUGE loss to my income and my clients ability to re-use or update past projects. Deeply disappointed. No computer I plug it into will recognize this devise anymore. I have 4 other external hard drives, one from 2006, ALL OF THEM STILL WORK LIKE CHAPMS.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you don�t want to take years off your life panicking from not being able to do your job properly, and missing deadlines trying to get this broken thing figured out.I am shocked that a company that is so well known could have literally no customer service! The product doesn't work on my laptop- it's a tech glitch. But when I got to Lacie site �o enter info, I got chatbots and error messages. Their tech phone number on their site is inoperational - yeah like no one home!Then I ended chatting with chatbots who referred me to Seagate inc. Too funny, that link took me to an expired web link. Then I got a real person on chat support. That person had literally no clue how to provide technical support, so I stopped chatting.True story, I get a chat message later that night from Seagate. It was from a chatbot and it referred back to an expired web page.Quite frankly. I am sure my minor glitch could have been addressed if LaCie stood behind their product. I woud caution anyone from buying this product - look elsewhere.Update: It works now- quite wellUpdate 11.7.21 without rhyme or reason it started working and i love product now but stand by my bad customer experience with this company.I waited to make a review most of these reviews below are right after purchase. These drives are faulty. You can hear them click when copying files to them. I used my on occasion only when I had to leave town. After a few months of using my hard drive a couple times a month it died. Lacie was bought out by Seagate so you have to use Seagates website to do a return then when you type in the model and serial info gives you get an error. So then you have to call Seagate to do a return which they then tell you will cost $50. I returned mine and received another one, same issue 5 months later drive will no longer open and I lost all my data again. Do not buy!This ""Rugged"" Drive didn't even survive shipping. This is the second LaCie drive I have had, and come to think of it my first one failed too. Unit would not mount on either my Mac or my PC. Drive was not visible via disk management and was beeping constantly. RMA'd and will be ordering a Western Digital drive. I am done buying these overpriced, overrated drives.I originally bought the LaCie hard drive because my MacBook was running out of storage. I rely heavily on my computer for online school as well as photography/filmmaking. Importing footage used to be a nightmare, and I was constantly deleting apps for space. My biggest worry was losing all of my essays, photographs, and short films, so I purchased the 1TB LaCie Rugged Mini. I've been using it for about 4 months now with absolutely no problems. Other than SD cards and limited space USB drives, this is my first real external storage device, and I couldn't be happier. It runs very smoothly, backs up my computer quickly, and has the space for all of my school work, imported footage, edited footage, and final projects. I've read reviews saying back ups were lost, but I have had no issues with crashing or loss of data. One of the main reasons I got the rugged mini was because I am a college student and I knew I would be carrying this around often. The size is no bigger than my iPhone, and I've noticed no damage from the few drops it has endured since purchase (about 5, 3 foot drops over the past 4 months). Another pro about this external hard drive is that it is compatible with MacOS (a feature I noticed other products didn't tend to have for some reason-mine is currently running on 10.12 Sierra). If I run out of storage again, this will be my go-to. Highly recommend. I'll post any updates if I encounter any problems down the line.Pro's:","Pro's:

Features waterproof and UV protection; can block 90% sunray, comes with ropes and stakes for added stability. Perfect for commercial or recreational use like party, wedding, graduation, flea market, small business, outdoor events, patio leisure, backyard, camping, picnics, sporting events, arts and crafts tables and much more. This party tent is meant for temporary use. Not Suit for all weather. Perfect for a calm windless dayIt was nice for my event.nanTaking into consideration all of the negative reviews my intent was to just use the tent one time for my sisters bridal shower! The wind was not in our favor that day (around 10mph) but the tent didn�t fly away or tear apart! One of the corners did have a small tear when we were putting it up but no big deal I bought the white scotch tape and it was fine! We actually taped all four corners just to make it more sturdy. We were able to fit 4 tables in the tent and the older folks really appreciated the shade it provided! For the price I would say it was totally worth it rather than paying +$500 just to rent one. I�m excited that I will get to use it again! To reiterate the wind situation does play a big role (I wouldn�t set it up if it�s going to be super windy). Also the poles were not all numbered correctly but once we started to put it together we were able to figure it out pretty quickly. Overall I�m very satisfied with my purchase! :)I got this for my birthday event and it was perfect. I actually assembled 95% of it by myself, just needed help at the very end to get everything standing. I also disassembled by myself, and I�m 5�7�, 120 lbs. it can be very sturdy if you do all the steps and make sure you stake the legs to the ground. You can�t beat it for the price I spent which was around $70 if I remember right.This 10 X 20' was exactly what we needed. Very easy to set up and has sturdy poles. I would recommend getting longer tent stakes and some more rope because it does not stand up to much wind unless you tie it down well. Overall it's a great value!Pro's:","Pro's:

PADDED KNUCKLE PROTECTION: Most starter gloves don�t fully protect your hands. S4 delivers splinted wrist support and cushioning foam to keep you properly protected while you hone your technique.. PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 pair of S4 Boxing Gloves. S4 is perfect for training, sparring, kickboxing, combat sports, taekwondo, kickboxing, MMA, muay thai, and martial arts.I go to ILoveKickboxing four times a week and punch for 45 mins each day. I have used and have different gloves from Sanabul 12 oz, Title Gel 10 oz and Sanabul 16oz. I wanted to upgrade to a premium glove since I�m using them more and read reviews for Hayabusa T3. The reviews were amazing and I�m sure they are every bit as good as the reviews mentioned; but I wasn�t ready to spend $140 on new gloves. Thankfully they came out with an entry level model!The gloves are snug and very well padded all around. I usually wear gel hand wraps with my other gloves; but with the padding on these gloves I don�t wear wraps or gloves. It had great wrist support and again the padding absorbs the hits. I have a heavy hand Especially when I�m punching the bag for power; after last nights round my hands did not feel sore. These gloves let me rebound faster and hit harder. The weight is also nice and balanced.I�m going to keep these for awhile before upgrading to the white Hayabusa T3 in the future incentive I hit my goals for this year.I expected great things from this glove given the brand name and reputation so far. I'm a decently handy boxer that just wanted some cheaper gloves that gave my hands some cushion first off right away I could tell these gloves we're too snug the 16 oz L and I'm not even that big of a guy 5'10 205 and there was not even enough cushion to go at a heavybag. I have Sanabul boxing gloves bottom of the rung ones that are falling apart and insulation flowing out of them yet they are more comfortable and have better punch absorbing abilities and my knuckles unpadded on one part. I would recommend heavier hitters and bigger guys to pass in this I wouldn't recommend this glove the 16 oz Lg ones for anyone over 165. And also getting hit with these probably hurt more than being hit barehanded handed stiff as a 2x4. I'm very dissapointed couldn't even finish my session with these had to switch back to my ancient and falling apart Sanabul boxing gloves which somehow felt betterI'm fairly new to boxing and am definitely not a subject matter expert but have used a few pairs of training gloves and these are by far my favorites. The first couple of times I hit the heavy bag with them they definitely felt tight and weird (for lack of a better term) but they broke in quickly and are now my go-to gloves for heavy bag work. These provide much more wrist support than my Sanabul training gloves and are snug but comfortable on my 5'11 male-sized hands. Honestly I cannot tell what on earth all the people who left 1 star reviews are talking about, as I have experienced none of it.That being said, I would have rated this product 2 or 3 stars had I written the review after my first heavy bag session, when they were not properly broken in. Other training gloves I've used have felt more or less ""natural"" right out of the box, while these definitely take some time.I love my new gloves! Also, for what it's worth, they look much prettier than my old ones, and the wine color is pretty baller! That being said if you are looking for a nice pair of training gloves, the Sanabul Essentials glove is also a good choice for heavy bag sessions. I believe they are considerably cheaper than these gloves, but won't do much to support your wrist so wrap your hands well :)Like many of these reviews mention, when I first got these gloves they were *snug*. Like in a concerningly, ""Do I have to return these?"", kind of way. I figured I'd at least give them a try first, and after a few good workouts (call it less than an hour on the bag) they really loosened up and are now far more comfortable. I imagine as they get some more punches in them they'll break in even further.I've only had these a couple of weeks, so can't properly evaluate durability yet, but so far I'm very pleased with these gloves! When these do eventually break down (assuming that's at least a year or two away) I'd likely want to invest in the high-end Hayabusa gloves.The gloves are AMAZING! I love the feel of them and the fact that they are so padded. The microfiber thumb is awesome for wiping off sweat. The second elastic is tight on my forearm (sadly they are a bit bigger), but I read a review that that was clipped off and it was perfectly fine. I'll try and see if it that works.The only, ONLY, downside was the fact that the package did not come with hand wraps. When I first found the listing I thought I saw that they come with set of wraps. Upon reading reviews I saw multiple pictures/ cases where wraps were included. When I received my order, and the wraps were not included, I was disappointed. Further investigation proved that the wraps were included at random and not in every order.Thankfully, I already had a set, but I was looking forward to this brand to see if I like them better. Looks like I'll have to order a set later.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Ergonomically engineered with a unique contoured and tight-fit hand compartment designed to provide a secure and snug fit.. Constructed of premium leather with the Fairtex foam system for excellent hand and knuckle protection and shock disbursement.. Genuine leather gloves with vectro straps.. All-purpose boxing gloves and Tight fit design.. Handmade in Thailand. Size: 8 - 16 oz.READ BEFORE BUYING. I've seen a few reviews of people who recieved fake gloves. To make sure you don't buy a fake, check that after you select the size and color that it says ""sold by Fairtex official, and fulfilled by Amazon."" (The sellers info won't pop up until you select size and color) Otherwise you may be buying from a 3rd party vendor and could receive knock-offs.I've heard great things about Fairtex for a while, but didn't need new gloves until recently. I was torn between the Fairtex bgv1 br (breathable model with grip bar), the Venum elites, the Twins special and the Hayabusa t3 which I've owned previously. The t3's are a great glove but I didn't feel like dropping another $140 when there could potentially be something out there of better/equal quality for less money.Glad I went with Fairtex. I'm in love with these gloves. Incredible value for under $100. Nice quality genuine leather. Solid stitching. Heavy duty velcro. They feel very well made overall. Very breathable too. They are definitely a more compact glove with a medium to high density foam that provides a lot of feedback and pop on the heavy bag. If you prefer a softer, bulkier and more ""protective"" glove these may not be for you, although with proper technique and properly applied hand wraps, the Fairtex have perfectly adequate hand protection. Note that the breathable model doesn't have any palm padding if you plan to use these for muay thai or kickboxing.The sizing/comfortability on these is kind of a touchy subject. I've seen some people claim these are a small and uncomfortable glove, that should only be worn by people with small hands. I personally don't find that to to be the case at all. These definitely require a break in period because they are leather with fairly dense foam underneath. During the break in period they may feel too snug and hurt your hands a bit, especially in the thumb area. I'm 5'11, 180 lbs, with average sized hands, and with full length wraps on the hand compartment is fine. Nice and secure and even a little room to spare.All in all these are an awesome glove. Hand made in Thailand from quality leather. Great feedback. Great ventilation. Nice and compact package. Good protection. Break them in well, always wrap your hands (as you should with any glove) and they will treat you well. If you're still on the fence, GO FOR IT.The gloves color is just as pictured, beautiful red! These gloves are for my 13yr old daughter. Our hands are the same size, she weighs 120lbs and I weigh 177lbs. These gloves fits perfectly. I believe, if your hands are any bigger, they wont fit comfortably. The 12's are perfect but the 14's padding would probably fit as well. The 16's would probably been too much for her. She's practicing Krav Maga/Muay Tai, so it's not as much punching bag work as boxing would be.Love them with all my heart! I am a woman, 5.5, 128 lbs, average sized hands for my height (for reference, my palm measured around is 8 inches. I usually wear size small in winter gloves). My trainer actually told me to get 10 oz, but because these are known to run somewhat small (the vendor says so himself), I got me a 12. They are a bit loose without hand wraps, but I wear hand wraps anyway (180 inch), so the gloves fit perfectly on top. They stabilise the wrist and help me position the fist correctly when hitting. They do have a grip bar (at least the model that I own). Love the ventilation. Love how they are made. Trainer approved. He says they will serve me for years if no one steals them (but I do not recommend trying to steal these gloves - I can literally kill for them).I have tried just about every brand in just about every size and I found the Fairtex 14 oz. ones to be the most comfortable and affordable. They also aren't ""bulky"" like most gloves.My only advice would be to use a little bit stronger material on the inside. Seems like they could tear easy after a while but so far, fantastic gloves.Gloves are solid. I can smack the crap out of the bag and it protects my wrists (have to wrap your hands, of course) and knuckles VERY well.I have Fairtex Shin Guards and they are fantastic. Overall, it's a great brand that makes quality gear.Real talk, almost all of Fairtex products are top quality and an EXCEPTIONAL value at their price point here in the USA. Fairtex gloves specifically are my preferred brand because as a clinch fighter, their smaller profile allows a greater level of maneuverability during inside fighting. That being said, the gloves that were sent are NOT the size that I ordered from Amazon. What I recieved, are absolutely a fantastic pair of Fairtex bag gloves but unfortunately, having paid the maximum price, I'm understandably unhappy to have recieved something that is of $25 lesser value. Honestly, now that they are here, I'm pretty happy to have a new pair of rad bag gloves but I must insist that Amazon gives me a return of $25 to make it right.ThxYer pal, AustinPro's:","Pro's:

Text: 20G PURE WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE- Easy to digest and with high bioavailability, our bar is a great source of protein and a quality health snack perfect for a high protein diet. With no artificial flavors like caramel, maple, matcha, smores, or sea salt.. JUST 3 WHOLE FOOD INGREDIENTS- Our clean, simple ingredients are a testament of the quality you can expect from every bar. Whether you are active and athletic or just looking for real nutritious foods on the go, this is one incredible non-GMO protein bar.. SMALL-BATCH HANDMADE- Artisanally crafted, every bar is hand-mixed and packed in small batches daily in our very own California facility. Our all-natural, gourmet ingredients have slight differences between bars so each bite is a new, delicious experience.. ENJOY ANYWHERE- Ideal for a pre-workout energy boost, post workout performance recovery, afternoon snack, or a meal replacement when you're on the go. This simple small size bar is complete creamy perfection! Eat it solo or with a healthy shake, smoothie or cup of coffee!. ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS YOU CAN TRUST- Our bars have perfectly balanced macros with high protein, natural fats, and clean carbs. We don�t use artificial sweeteners, flavors, or anything else other than our incredibly simple and clean 3 ingredient list.I purchased the almond honey off of a recommendation from a good friend. Tastes simple and good. Not too sugary like most bars on the market which is what I love about it. The texture is not crunchy or grainy. It's more like a nugget, though you can subtly taste the whey protein. We enjoy it as a family.**** If this review or the pictures helped, or if you're just bored and enjoy clicking things - could I trouble you for a ""Yes"" or a ""Helpful"" vote below? Many thanks mate! ????We received our latest order Sept. 14, and have been ordering these monthly for over a year. The product has shrunk by 1/3... price has increased from 25.99 to 26.99 a box.... Why has the product shrunk not only lengthwise but thickness wise also?Time to look elsewhere... Much too much money for The Incredibly Shrinking BarI bit into a 1/4 inch metal screw when eatting one. Needless to say this has changed my opinion about these. I emailed the company and haven�t heard back.If your looking for fine dining, keep scrolling. If your looking for something that doesn�t have that fake chemical taste (or ingredients), then consider this protein bar. I love that this bar will give me several hours of energy, and is great on the go or when I don�t have time to eat a traditional sit-down meal. I�ve tried many, many other protein bars and this one, by far, is the best quality with a mild crunchy texture. Unlike some other bars, this one doesn�t stick to your teeth like super-glue; bonus! I highly recommend these bars and the original almond honey flavor in particular. (The other flavors are just not my cup of tea). Though I�ve tried other brands, I keep going back to these. I�ve been buying these bars for the last 4-years and will keep doing so.First off, of the total of 2 orders of RiseBar almond protein bars that I've had, I have not had 1 dry or old tasting bar at all.I've been looking for a protein bar that is really healthy, clean and doesn't taste like saw dust for awhile now. I've tried various ones at health food stores including main stream health bars like Cliff and quest, I've gotten assortment packs in order to try out different companies flavors, by the way I highly recommend doing this, you never know what the taste is going to be with a protein bar. Always good to have variety to choose from.I got the assortment Risebar pack with the protein almond, the coconut energy, and assorted nut energy bar, both of the last two were actually kinda gross, so I would not recommend them.Now what this bar fulfills is important to me, I am one of those people who has those spells of walking around and having no idea what I'm hungry for, but I still want to ravenously eat things. This is a very bad thing to have when trying to eat healthy. Anyways, so that and a desire to start building muscle is why I started looking into various protein bars. This one hands down has fulfilled that insatiable hunger that I get sometimes, and it also(to me and everyone I have had try it, like 7 people) tastes pretty dang good. I'm not huge into eating the same foods over and over again, but I have to say TRY this once if you are someone who can never get full and just test it, you will soon learn what I'm talking about.In conclusion, I like that this bar is so simple, 3 ingredients is pretty simple for today's standards, and that helps me understand mentally exactly what I'm putting in my body. I love these bars, if they stay the way they are I will be buying them for a long time into the future. Hope this helps, and as always, have a nice HEALTHY day!Pro's:","Pro's:

I highly recommend, already repurchased and recommended to friends.The Detox Project found concerning levels of glyphosate in Orgain products. As much as I want to love this product, I can't as long as pesticides are found in the product. Glyphosate is linked to cancer and hormone abnormalities. For now I'm using GOLD STANDARD 100% Whey Protein Powder, Double Rich Chocolate, it's Whey but it's hormone and pesticide free. Just avoid their other flavors because they added artificial sweetners. Why is it so hard to find something healthy that is marketed as healthy?It�s costly but my daughter really likes the taste which is slightly cinnamon. But most important are the ingredients! I am so happy to replace the ensure she�s been drinking which is full of chemicals with this.I've tried HUEL before, and I liked it a lot. It doesn't taste sweet- neutral flavor. BUT, wanted to try something organic and this brand seems to have all the right stuff in it's blend. I am NOT a diabetic, however, THIS ONE IS WAAAY TOO SWEET!Nowhere in the description did I see that it contains Stevia - but it does. It's in the list of ingredients way down near the bottom. Had I known that I wouldn�t have ordered this. The product promos say: ""NO SUGAR ADDED"" and that may be true, but STEIVIA IS A SWEETNER AND A SUGAR REPLACEMENT. I am not happy with my purchase!I�ve bought other Orgain products before and really like them. This one is way too sweet. No where in the description did I see that it contains Stevia - but it does.

Shop with confidence and enjoy a 30-day, 100% money-back guarantee.I bought this chain in 2016 in 16"". It's so delicate that I was worried about its durability, however, I never take it off and it's been a trooper. I'm terribly rough on it yet it has endured. It's so dainty and doesn't take away from my beautiful jade pendant. I just bought another in a different length for a different pendant because I'm so impressed with the quality.I was happily surprised when I saw this necklace in person. It�s lightweight, doesn�t tangle and as you can see for yourself makes its own statement. The clasp is small, kinda hard to put on yourself, but somehow I managed. I�d definitely recommend this chain for quality and value.I had my doubts ordering a gold necklace online but I am pleasantly surprised! I have a slim neck so I bought the 16� and it sits just comfortably below my collarbone! It�s the perfect length to where I can tuck it under my shirt or show it off. It is beautiful and matches my pendant! The quality is great and Im honestly really glad I bought it! I never take it off and I usually have trouble with my hair getting caught in chains but there�s been no snags whatsoever, the necklace may be dainty but it�s quality. My best advise is to the size guid to get the right fit and read recent reviews!I needed a solid gold chain that would compliment the gold nugget my husband mined for me and had made into a necklace. Any lesser quality in the chain would be very visible next to the nugget. This chain is gorgeous and looks amazing with the nugget. Its dainty but so far my 2 year old hasn't broken it off my neck so it's definitely sturdy! I love it so much I never take it off. It looks beautiful in the sparkly sunshine and even in the dull clouds. I am very happy with the quality.Exactly what I was looking for.. Very thin, dainty, not too shiny, barely there, feminine gold chain that's perfect for when you want the pendant to take center stage! Or for when you have a pendant that's too loud/busy and you want to tone it down. Good chain, good price. Length of the chain in picture is 16inch.UPDATE: Nov, 2018 The chain is still going strong after 2 years. I never take it off, I sleep with it, I shower with it, even my kittens pulls on it when playing sometimes yet it�s held well. Quite impressive for such a thin chain.Pro's:","Pro's:

I will update this review in six months to verify stability.This is my second time to buy the canopy in my backyard. My first canopy was destroyed during the heavy snow in 2021 because I forgot to clear the accumulation of snow. I had need used this canopy for three years ago. Compared with previous one, this canopy has stronger structure, and the design of paulin is more reasonable and sturdy. My husband and me used around 2 hour to installed our new canopy. We feel satisfied. It look like so nice. Also, if you feel that it is not strong enough, you can built something heavy base to reinforce it slightly. It will be better.This is the best carport I�ve ever purchased. It�s super sturdy and stands up to the wind well. The stakes it came with aren�t enough for our wind, which we learned the hard way. It blew away and got stuck on the chicken house. It had no damage and we were able to flip it right side up and stake it with tposts. Now it stays where we put it no matter how bad the wind is.

A complete set of screws perfectly fit in pre-punched holes on these stools. A detailed instruction with numbered steps will guide you to install these bar stools effortlessly and save much time.Good stools for the price. Assembly was not too hard, but may pose a challenge for some people. Make sure that the holes line up the way they are supposed to before screwing the bolts in. The long support bars go on the bottom drilled holes and the short go on the top (when stool is upright). If you face them the correct direction, everything should work out -- make sure you check the alignment if they don't match up before you get upset and contact the company. Materials are decent and stools are fairly sturdy for the type of stool. The white gets dirty easy, but washes off. I'd recommend for the price.These are just what I was looking for! It took maybe 30 minutes to put together and they look beautiful under the counter and they don�t take up any floor space.I have a small counter with narrow space so these stools were just a perfect fit. Fortunately the color of the wood (a medium brown) was perfect with my refaced cabinets. They seem quite sturdy and I hope they will hold up over time. The seat material on mine is a very light beige, more of a cream and go well with my new granite counters.I needed two stools to compliment my existing ones. They worked perfectly.

Disclaimer: The digital images we display have the most accurate color possible. However, due to differences in computer monitors, we cannot be responsible for variations in color between the actual product and your screenThese drapes have really elevated the look of our new home! I have them in birch/108"" in my living/nook area and hung high. I also have them in birch 96"" in my girls' room. Then I have them in oyster/108"" in my dining. They are perfect.I hung them initially using the loops, but then I ordered the 1inch drapery pins + the round hooks and omg, that changes the game! With them being so high and the rod going through the fabric loops, it was harder to slide them without shifting the rod, due to thebdiameter of my rod. So the rings allow me to position, open and close them with the ease of a shower curtain. These are so pretty!They are definitely blackout, heavy and non see-through, which was my goal because I chose not to install blinds in our home. I also love the look it gives the windows from outside!These are well worth the investment. I bought them for every window!I ordered these curtains in oatmeal and birch after seeing them on a design blog. I wanted to compare the quality and color of these curtains to some curtains I recently bought from Crate and Barrel that were double the price. Since the reviews were so great for these curtains, I thought it would be worth ordering one panel in oatmeal and one panel in birch to compare with my Crate and Barrel curtains before we committed to them since they were pricey. I was a little bit nervous about the color of these curtains in the pictures because oatmeal looked a little darker than I wanted and birch was rumored to have pink undertones. I am so glad I ordered a couple panels to compare before returning my other curtains or buying a full order. The quality for price is top notch, but as you can imagine they don�t compare to my Crate & Barrel curtains. The oatmeal in person is a little darker than I wanted (as I expected based on the pictures), and the birch was surprisingly nice and only had subtle peach undertones when I held them up to my off-white wall. I decided to return both of the panels and keep the Crate & Barrel curtains, but moral of the story is: these are great curtains for the price. Seem to be great quality. They just didn�t have the texture and complexity that I was looking for. Also, if you were hesitant about what color would look best in your house, I 100% recommend that you order a few single panels of the colors you�re interested in and compare in your own home.These are gorgeous. I was hunting for the perfect taupe drapes and ordered oatmeal, nomad tan and mink. Oatmeal is the perfect warm gray shade, but the others are pretty too. Mink is more brown gray, nomad tan is more warm beige.nanI�ve purchased numerous drapery panels from HPD�never disappointed! First time ordering this particular style and I love them. Nicely weighted; ours hang beautifully from a ceiling track.�Blackout�: Definitely not full blackout but this room gets direct morning sun. They are room darkening; I think the color and fabric both contribute to this distinction: we have HPD velvet blackout drapes in navy and they literally keep our Master DARK (it�s fabulous).Sound Dampening: Yup! Love the difference�actually makes the room feel different... cozy.Color: After much handwringing I purchased �oyster� based upon one review indicated oyster seemed to have a teal undertone. This room is BM Narraganset green�a deep blue with a lot of green in it (or vice versa LOL). When placed in the room I did indeed seem to see a blue-green undertone (that was perfect in our room). BUT, oyster is a bit of a shifter.... took a panel into our other guest room painted BM barberry (a suggested F&B �sulking room pink� dupe) and oyster looks beautiful in there, too, and not the slightest bit of teal�super neutral, in fact. Compared to a set of Ballard design Surrey pleated drapes in �cream�, the cream looked sickly yellow and oyster was like a light warm gray (greige) but without any yellow, blue or green undertones. Color is so subjective but oyster is a versatile option with [a bit shifty, but overall] neutral undertones.Pro's:","Pro's:

EASY TO ASSEMBLE:We have detailed installation videos and instructions to facilitate your installation.We advice you to do this work with 2-5 people and it will take about 2-4 hours to finish it. YITAHOME has a professional team to provide great services for you. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact usThe build quality of the YITAHOME 10x12ft Double Roof Hardtop Gazebo is very good. It looks durable, only time will tell. It came 4 days earlier than promised. It came in two packages, each about 65lbs. I laid out all the parts on a drop cloth in my garage. I started the assembly inside the garage until step number 4 (four legs with A, B, B1, C and C1). I then moved the four partially assembled frames to my patio. There I connected part P to create two halves of the frame. At this point, I asked my wife to hold one side of the frame upright while I connected the other half of the frame using part P. This was very easy. I assembled 95% of the gazebo alone, requiring my wife�s help only couple of times. It took me about 16-20 hours (spread out over one week) to finish the assembly. You will need good quality ladders to build the gazebo. I will recommend not to use power tools. I used the supplied hex key.Make sure to follow the instructions very carefully. There is a mistake either in the instruction or part labeling for parts E and F. Swap them. They provided exact member of bolts and screws but unfortunately some of their screws came unusable. I had to get same sized screws from Home Depot. In my opinion, parts Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4 are slightly larger than they should be, they don�t fit properly. Do not tighten the screws and bolts all the way until you have inserted every single bolt.I used four large planting pots to weigh down the legs (I didn�t want to drill my patio pavers) and planted flowers in the pots. I drilled three drain holes in each pot bottom, then first filled with river pebbles, followed by sand, flowed by potting soil. The river pebbles to keep the drain holes free from clogging, the sand to filter the water so that they don�t stain my patio pavers. I will see how long the aluminum legs stay rust free.This is very nice gazebo,was tired of buying canopies for my soft top gazebo every year or 2. Went together pretty easy with my wife and son and daughter�s help. There were no reviews on Amazon for it but I took a chance and glad I did,it�s beautiful. 1 post had a litt dent in it but the company made it right. The company I bought it from is top notch. I will be more than happy to deal with them in the future.LoveWe purchased the 10 x 12 gazebo to put on our composite deck. Putting it together (2 people in their 60's, 2+ days) wasn't easy, but doable.One thing we did to fix the ""clip nightmare"" (the clips are suppose to mount on the edges of the roof panels, but they pop off easily which makes sliding the panels in place really frustrating) was to put a little epoxy on the clips right before sliding them on to the roof panels...and then a little extra once the clips were in place. We used Gorilla 2 Part Epoxy with a 5 minute set and let them set up for about 30 minutes. Yeah, it took a little extra time, but not a single clip popped off!! When we snapped the panels in the tracks, ALL the clips held!!Overall, it seems like a sturdy, good quality gazebo and customer service was great. We had a handful of pieces that had scratches and one piece that was dented (but fixable and not in a place you'd notice it) so we took pics and contacted the company. They gave us a partial refund. As far as the scratches we used a marker on the smaller scratches, but one roof panel had multiple scratches so we used a high quality black gloss spray paint (primer and paint in one) and it looked perfect!It was delivered in 5 boxes instead of 2 mentioned in older comments. Packaging 9 out of 10, basically no damage. Instructions 8 out of 10, clear enough, with some word comments in decent English. Extra pieces of most fasteners included. Assembled practically by myself, with very minor help from the wife. Metal clips on roof sheets were the most annoying parts until I figured out how to slide the roof sheets into the frame without the clips falling off. Overall, quite satisfied with the purchase.Pro's:","Pro's:

Size:10x20 Ft,Top Height 10.5Ft,Three Height Adjustment Settings by Each 3.46""Shipping was quick and it was well protected in the shipping box. The tent itself was easy to set up. Make sure that you put the canopy cover on first before you expand it fully.The pop up feature was huge for us! This canopy is a great product, but after using others there are a few luxuries that we missed. Most of those luxuries have to do the sidewalls.We finally just got to set it up now that some of the snow has started to melt. We were so excited that for the price it was listed at it came with six side walls to completely enclose it. That was a huge deciding factor in purchasing this 10� x 20� high peak canopy.The only adjustments we would make are:�The attachments for the sidewalls. They are Velcro strips. It would be nice be nice if they were alastic bands with the metal hooks like most brands on the market.�Stake hooks for the bottoms of the sidewalls. This would be to ensure that the walls are more secure and don�t balloon into the interior of the canopy.�The last modification we would make has to do with the storage bag. It does not have a pocket to store the canopy top or sidewalls. A place for the top would be perfect.Overall, this is a great product. The sidewalls allow us to accomplish what we need to with our late summer camping trips in giving us a warm place to hang out with our fire pit. Once the sidewalls are up and closed it holds heat really well. Makes this 38 degree weather very enjoyable.I love the shade this is providing us on our deck. The canopy has blown off and tore at the Velcro. I pulled out my sewing machine and repaired/replaced the Velcro. The BEST thing I did was open the center seam in 2 places and restitched 10� vents so when a breeze comes along it blows through withoutComing apart. The frame, we screwed into the deck with eye screws. I did order a back up canopy, I will vent this one before I use it!Bought these tents when the ones that we originally purchased fell apart in less than 24 hours. This tent arrived 2 days earlier than scheduled. The quality was great and very sturdy. This one was a great purchase.nanSo, I purchased this tent and used it on September 7th. The tent went up fine and worked well. The carry bag ripped when we tried to bag it up at the end of the night. The seller promptly emailed me after my 3 star review(oddly enough, that review is gone now!) and offered a replacement bag. Great, I thought! Well I finally get the ""new"" carry bag today.... and it is a used bag, with the stitching on one off the carry handles already coming loose and the rollers have been drug across asphalt/concrete or something. So I got a bag, undoubtedly that was returned to the seller. I do appreciate them offering to make it right, but a torn seam at a carry handle is not going to hold up. Guess I will use the bag until it rips and then spend more money purchasing a heavy duty carry bag!So, as far as the tent is concerned, it seems fairly sturdy. It went up easy, although it does take 4 or 5 people, but it is big, so not a huge deal. The sides seems good.HOWEVER, the carry bag is cheap. Mine tore the first night and it was replaced by the seller, with another used bagged that is surely gonna come apart because the stitching is already coming loose. This thing is heavy and needs a heavy duty carry bag!Pro's:","Pro's:

Please contact us if any issue. Items can be returned within 30 days of receipt of delivery.We will response email within 24hours.This wig is amazing for the price. This is my first wig and am so happy and it makes me feel sexy. I had to cut the bangs to fit my face. Otherwise, it is full and long with natural waves. I wanted a wig to give my natural hair a rest from coloring and give me a chance to change up my look. With no experience, I took a chance on this one and the price was inexpensive. The pic in sleeveless shirt is of the wig right out of the packaging with only a shake and finger comb. The other pic is with a good, light combing and a little styling. Definitely recommend this wig. Since there are no clips/combs other than the adjustable bands around the base, I purchased a wig grip headband to hold the wig in place. I also, recommend investing in a detangling/conditioning spray to keep the wig in good condition.Alright, for a $23 wig, this girl is actually pretty impressive. The texture is soft and smooth, for a synthetic. The color has some nice variation that adds dimension and keeps it from looking too fake. The bangs are meant to be cut down yourself, they are quite long. It looks like the pictures of the wig that the seller shows. Ignore the picture of the girl, that is definitely her real hair. The interior is wefted/track and it has a small plastic skintop at the part.I own a wig company, so I�m going to be customizing this� but its a nice color.Lovely. Feels nice. I trimmed the bangs. Husband and I are a fan of this wig.I absolutely love this wig, I will probably buy another soon. I�ve had it for about 3 months and I wear the crap out of it. The color is stunning, the style stays, and there is very very little shedding. Every time I wear this wig I get multiple compliments.The only thing that bugs me is that the hair line is a little thick. I typically wear a hat with it, but I�m sure I can get away with not wearing one.I am in love with this wig! It�s super soft for synthetic hair and with minimal shedding. The color is gorgeous and is layered well like the photo! The cap fits securely and is even adjustable for a perfect fit. The bangs also come a little long so you can style them to the side or trim them to your liking. Very comfortable wig and very gorgeous !!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Microfiber PU casing (made in Japan) for long life. Four layers of natural foam. Perforated palm: better breathability. Anatomical shape / Grip: optimized fist placement. Fully assembled and hand sewn in ThailandVenum has several lines of boxing gloves, starting with Contender and ending with Giant.They all look beautiful, but vary a great deal in term of comfort, padding, and cooling.Disclaimer: I train in Muay Thai, twice/thrice per week, mostly doing mitt work/sparring. I use different (much lighter) gloves for bag work.I would advise to stay away from Contender�So, after a year of use these gloves have not shown any signs of wear or tear. Incredibly, the paint is still as vivid and solid as the day I�ve received them a year ago.I rotate between my other gloves bi-daily, and there are times when these aren�t used for at most 2 weeks. One thing that I�m always surprised about is, after coming back to these gloves, how incredibly tailored-made they seem, despite being mass produced. They just fit so incredibly well. The construction is also superb; these don�t feel cheap. Now, I own a pair of Fairtex and Cletos, and still�I�ll gladly use these in place of those any day.Overall, the looks and feel are still incredible. However, even after a year of use, they still feel quite sturdy and stiff, which may be a problem to some with more sensitive hands. As I said in my review a year ago, these gloves aren�t really forgiving for those with heavy hands and poor form. They�re a Striker�s glove. Technical, good form is a must.I originally ordered a pair of fairtex gloves but the shipping time took too long and I needed something quick so I overnighted these venom gloves via prime. I ordered the 16oz gloves for reference. The quality, fit and finish is very nice. They don�t feel like they�re going to fall apart and they have a nice sturdiness to them. The material is not real leather but in reality it holds up and looks just as good as leather (other people won�t look down on you for having the synthetic leather). My hands fits just perfect in these gloves and I�m 190 pounds. Without wraps my hands are snug but not tight. With wraps they are tight but a perfect �tight� when nothing will move around but it won�t cut your circulation off either. The padding is really good in this glove as well. I don�t feel a thing when I hit the heavy bag many times during training with hand wraps on. I use these gloves for Muay Thai so if you�re looking for a pure boxing glove these probably won�t be the right shape. They have a lot of padding on the palm as well. Overall I�m very happy with my purchase and if you aren�t getting one of the Thai brands this is the next best thing for the price.I was waiting to write this review, as I wanted to see how well these gloves would hold up over time. I'm happy to say they have held up well. I was especially concerned with whether they would develop an odor over time and the answer is NO! (I've been very careful to dry them well after using and spraying the inside with tea tree oil.) The gloves have great padding for protection and the wrist straps are very supportive. I was hesitant to spend this much money on a pair of gloves but I'm glad I did!My hands feel like they are lightning fast with these gloves. It could be I was using m my old gloves for wayyyyy too long and they were saturated with sweat and goop making them weigh 8 pounds each. These are great gloves for the casual boxer doing workouts. That is all I can vouche for since I am not an amateur or pro boxer of any kind. I marked a 4 star for comfort because my left thumb gets pinched a bit in the thumb box of the glove. I expect this will clear up as I break the gloves in more. I'd buy again.Pro's:","Pro's:

These magnetic strips worked perfectly as an alternative to a frame. The magnets are super strong.Seal the diamond first with gloss Mod Podge to ensure the diamonds stay. The diamonds will stay sparkly after the Mod Podge dries.Make sure to leave a ""1 length of canvas at the top and bottom of the diamond painting.You can trim side edges to the painting or leave a bit of the canvas to give it a minor frame effect. If you do, I recommend using a trim tape of some type to keep the glue edge from collecting dust and hair.I will be getting more of these for my other paintings for sure.Way cheaper than a frame and allows you to see the diamonds sparkle!It's nice to let your kids put up some ""art"" as they hit around 5/6 ... and this totally helps to keep the framing/hanging on budget. They look quite nice, lending a child's room a feel that's at once playful, simple and even scholarly in a way.They are super easy to use, are not heavy though have enough weight to give the work some substance, legitimacy and class. They won't cause any damage if they fall, and at this age, kids can put them together themselves, and even swap out items if they want to.I'm not sure I'd use this for my own pieces -- unless they had a certain chart/science guide type vibe. Related to that, I think these tend to work best for items that do have that kinda geometric, even composition (see pic). My daughter has another of these that came with the hanger, and its a series of birth stones and gems. That's the kinda subject matter that I think would work well with this.Also, if the piece itself is anything of any value, I'd consider another framing mechanism if only for protection. So, as mentioned, great budget approach to give a room an aesthetic lift while keeping price in mind.This is exactly what I was looking for! I ordered a picture online from one of those Facebook ads, and of course it is a random size not usually found in frames. It is 16 inches wide though, and this frame fits it perfectly! Quick and easy to set up, I put it together in mere seconds. The esthetic of it suits the picture as well, giving it an organic feel. And can we talk about the price? So reasonable! Really very pleased with this frame and would recommend!I bought this to hang a poster I had printed, and it definitely does the job and brings a different aesthetic than a frame would. It would be nice if there were some kind of sleeve to protect the poster. If you're really concerned with protecting what you're hanging, I wouldn't say this is the product for you, but if you just like the way this looks over a normal frame, it's great. The magnets are strong and work as intended, easy use. The width is the only measurement that really matters, as the length will be determined only by your poster (nothing connects the pieces).nanPro's:","Pro's:

I read through a couple of the reviews stating that this contains high amounts of heavy metals, and I would just like to say they are outdated with their claims.The Garden of Life brand was tested by an independent lab in 2014, and they found their products contained elevated amounts of heavy metals, most likely due to the brown rice protein they use. Garden of Life responded and CHANGED THEIR METHODS. They have a self-imposed regulation of heavy metals for their products now (the USDA does not have any limit or regulation on heavy metals in food) and these are their limits :Lead limit: 250 ppbTungsten limit: 50 ppbCadmium limit: 1000 ppbMercury limit: 50 ppbEverything has some sort of heavy metal in it. Everything. These limits are phenomenal, and you can go to their website and see their recent heavy metal tests on their products.So people, stop fear mongering. This is a great product, and an excellent company.First I do not usually write reviews although I'm taking the time to maybe try to help someone else decide if they would want to spend the money and try this. Do it... what would it hurt? In January, after turning 41, I decided it was time get healthier as it seemed each year I have been gaining about 10lbs per year and lacked energy. I have a sore foot so running or walking was not an option. So I decided if I can't exercise I would try to start eating healthier. After watching fruits and veggies go bad in the fridge, I starting looking at easier ways to get that stuff in my body. Fast forward 10 months ahead, which is today, I have taken this in substitute of my breakfast every day. I am 34 lbs lighter and a lot more energy. I really believe my body was lacking all the nutrients it needed to perform everyday life. All the good stuff I'm putting in my body with just 1 glass far exceeds what I could cook in the kitchen. The night before I mix 1 scoop of the vanilla blend w water in a mason jar. In the morning I pull it out of fridge, shake up good, and drink on my way to work. I was not looking to lose weight by drinking this, I was looking at putting nutrition back in my life, but how can a woman in her 40s comp,ham about weight loss!!I have tried so many meal replacement powders for my weight loss goals. Just about everything out there has artificial sweeteners, organic stevia, monk fruit, etc. I CAN'T have anything but good old fashioned sugar, or I will be horribly sick. Out of the ones I found that offer a low amount of natural sugar only, and had all the nutritional qualities I needed....all of them have been unbearable to drink in terms of taste. Most reviews on here are all about adding milk, bananas, fruits, even peanut butter, etc. to make it taste better. Hello? I want to lose weight. Adding all those fats and calories completely contradict the purpose of this meal replacement as a weight loss supplement. I only want to consume this as directed using plain old water. No fancy blenders or gadgets, I want simple. I can only attest to this specific flavor, but WOW! I am talking about the flavor ""Lightly Sweet"". It only has a minimal amount of real sugar, and some natural vanilla. Here's what I do:I take a refrigerated 16oz bottle of water. I drink half of it to wash down my daily vitamins and supplements. Then, with the remaining 8 oz of water I use a piece of paper or paper plate folded in half to pour the scoop of powder into the narrow opening. Put the cap back on and shake briskly for a couple seconds. It mixes up perfect. Drink it down immediately, and get on with your day. It certainly has a slight texture, but nothing compared to others. The taste is a faint hint of vanilla cake batter. It doesn't linger. I find it quite pleasant, and don't need to rinse it away with more water.I find this to be a simple, fast routine as compared to other reviewers' suggestions. I stay full for 4-5 hours and replace 2 meals a day. I feel great. I actually look forward to drinking these, unlike the others that make me gag. Try it, and see for yourself!I was on my 3rd container of this product when I learned about the consumer report on dangerous levels of heavy metals. I am deeply concerned because I was consuming this product at least once a day, believing that I was using something safe and nutritious. I found that this product, along with many others, are falsely promoted as clean and I can only imagine the damage being done to our bodies when ingesting it on a daily basis. I realize that this is partly due to this being a plant based protein powder and some amounts are naturally occurring and others are due to environmental pollution. However, I do not believe that should be an excuse to mislead or entirely ignore when marketing, selling, and manufacturing a product that has alarmingly high amounts of these substances. I believe that when people seek out and buy ""RAW"" or ""Organic"" products it is to avoid things like this to their best ability, I certainly know this is the case for me. By no means am I here to bash this product but I would like more responsibility and care to be taken on the manufactures part to fix this issue, or at least have to clearly label and inform consumers. Not only do I use this brand of protein powder, but I use their vitamins as well, my entire household does. So, I take this extremely personal! I admit I could have researched this more when looking to purchase supplements, I guess I fall into the category of naive and wanted to believe that brands that portray themselves as CLEAN really are, and I take my part of responsibility in that. I am not an expert in have no background in this type of thing but I do my best to make sure I am giving my family the best that I can, heck I even pay the price for it. At the end of the day, this is a much larger issue and more there need to be stricter requirements for labeling, regulating, etc. My only intention of this review is to bring awareness to other costumers, like myself, so that they may have the chance to be more informed before making the conscious decision to purchase this product.My husband and I both love it. We were taking Shakeology but ran out so we ordered Raw Organic Meal Replacement in Chocolate. It's so good! It tastes amazing with frozen bananas and peanut-butter and some almond milk. That's my husband's favourite recipe. I like to add cold coffee and almond milk for my morning pick-me-up. I also ordered the Vanilla Protein and it's very versatile. I like both and will probably order again. Shipping was fast and the containers came sealed and listed all the ingredients on the back. The label looks nice too. I like the product very much.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanThe vampires return to Barrow, Alaska, to finish off the witnesses to the last attack. The inhabitants of the town are prepared, but not for every trick the vampires have. As it turns out, both sides have a surprise waiting for them.I am afraid that surprise was for the characters, not someone who read the middle volume of the trilogy. I still loved the book, especially when its setting was in Alaska. Niles provided a script full of colorful characters and grounded and thrilling action. Still, I felt that Templesmith�s art made the book exceptional, especially during the night battle in the Arctic winter, where he made blurs of color and cartoonish portraitures seem atmospheric.Barrow, Alaska was a scene that saw 19 people out of a population of 462 walk away physically intact and the rest - well, you know the drill. In the three years after-the-fact Barrow has also become a Mecca of sorts, with Vampires striving to erase both proof and place in the proces, the curious looking for answers, and droves of family members hoping to know what really happened on those fateful nights. There are also the people who still reisde in Barrow, knowing what they know and also knowing no one will listen. Enter a new sheriff hoping to understand what happened to his brother, a new wave of events that gather at the mesh walls now surrounding an obscure town in an obscure place, and another 30 days before the sun comes up again.Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.While I didn't think that Return to Barrow lived up to the previous outing in the series, it really had some portions that were emotionally transfixing and I have to say that I liked what Niles did overall. When I read the recount of the sheriff's brother and what had transpired, finding out about him and his family, I was touched by the pain inside the moment and the way it was described. When I saw the expressions that Templesmith etched into one of the hardened Alaska survivors, you could almost see a tinge of wilderness inside that haunted man. There were also some loose ends furthered in the piece, some vampires looking awfully cute (those kids are adorably wild), and then there were the tactile changes that made Barrow something of a Road Warrior type nightmare.That was the beautiful.There were some not-so-beautiful areas in the book, too, and some of those might be particularly bothersome depending on what you want/ need. The ""secret"" harbored in the book was one I still don't know if I really like, and the assault on Barrow has a lot of pieces that are more like footnotes from the first 30 Days. There were differences, granted, and new players in a new game that has different stakes. Still, Dark Days set the sequel bar pretty high and some might find this a bit of a letdown.If you liked the first 30 Days of Night and have followed along through Dark Days, you might want to finish the story because there are a few loose shoelaces that beg to be tied. If you didn't really like the first but enjoyed the second, you might want to use caution before proceeding. I personally liked the book a lot but this might not be the thing for everyone.It all boils down to how much the account of Barrow haunts you.After the film adaptation of 30 Days of Night received only so-so reviews, instead of waiting for the movie on DVD, I decided to take a look at the original comics/graphic novels created by Steve Niles and Ben Templesmith.Interestingly, 30 days was originally fielded unsuccessfully to studios as a screenplay before Niles hooked up with Templesmith to create the comic. Once the comic came out, even studios that had originally rejected the movie pitch were knocking down the 30 Days creators' doors to get the film rights (according to a 10/18/2007 IGN.com article).Anyway, when I looked up 30 Days at Amazon, I found that more than just one version existed. There is the original�'Return to Barrow' is the third part in the 30 Days of Night: series of graphic novels by Steve Niles and is based 3 years after the original. Brian Kitka, the brother of former Barrow police officer, William Kitka, and his young son move to the isolated town of Barrow, Alaska to investigate the deaths of his brother and the rest of the population, when he takes the role as the new sheriff. At first he is relucant to believe that the deaths were at the hands of blood thirsty vampires until he reads his brother's journal and then sees for himself when the Dark begins again and the vampires return.If you've read the first two, this will come as an absolute treat to you, returning to the original setting and with new characters and a couple of older ones such as Agent Norris and Dane (both from Dark Days). The action is heavy from the start and the storyline is as exciting and as tense as the original. Expect lots of blood and gore and plenty of surprises for the regular 30 Days of Night reader. I highly recommend this to you if you have read the first two books as it is equally as good, if not better, than it's predecessors. Well worth picking up and adding to your collection.I like itPro's:","Pro's:

I needed it for a 5 gallon bowl aquarium with a Bio-bag setup (see Dr. Novak, Youtube) & it works great. The plants & guppies aren't disturbed by a large current flow yet it's powerful enough to maintain a crystal clear bowl. Many compartments to add your desired filter media. Works as described & I also use it to gravel vac several Betta tanks.Very quiet and effective. I bought another in case I ever need an emergency replacement or if I get a second aquarium. Instructions are in ""Chinglish"" but assembly is simple and almost self-explanatory. I am very happy with the product and price!If you like water outside you tank this is the filter for you. if you like it in the tank then you might consider other options.the problem is not so much the filter or the pump, they actually look to be well designed. and the fact that you can cut your own sponges for finer filtration is a big boon.but the problem is in the flow adjusters. they leak at the back of the output...And let's talk for a moment about dumb design. you have a inlet adjustment and an output adjustment. you only need one.Cut the flow to the inlet and the output flow is reduced and since the inlet is under suction no chance of leaks. but putting one at the output is just asking for trouble since it's under pressure.Dumb design.Everything else is rock solid but it's that little drip, drip, drip of a leak that knocks it to one star.If you like you tank area wet by all means get this, if not select something else.For the money this filter works well. Built with heavy plastic, very tight seal. Well worth what it costs.BUYING TWO MOREPro's:","Pro's:

This is your product. Construction appears of acceptable quality.I was looking for sweatpants. They will be returned.I ordered a size smaller than I usually do because I was looking for a tighter fit. They were 100% in line with expectations as far as size goes.They�re just not sweats.I�m a 5�2 girl, 110 pounds and the size Large fit amazing. Super comfy becuase of the cotton. Drawstring comes in handy to secure them. Not too long either. I love that they have pockets! Two in the front and one on the back. The pockets fit my large iPhone without worrying it�ll fall out like I do if I wore women�s pants. No complaints, will buy more! Only side note they really shouldn�t advertise these as exclusively men�s. Usually clothes marketed to men are more comfortable and have a better quality (cotton and not polyester) and have bigger pockets. These really should be unisex or no gender, just comfy pants. Women�s sweat pants are typically horrible.I bought these pants for my husband and used my Cricut to iron on a design using everyday iron-on vinyl. They look super high quality and everyone who saw them thought that I had purchased them with the design on them from a store!The seams are wider than expected but not a. Issue, just makes them more noticeable.My husband wears a 34-30 pant size and these hit the floor when he doesn�t have shoes on, but not so much that he trips. I�d say they are comfortably loose. He wears them all the time!! ??The stitching all seems to be well done and the elastic isn�t too tight or loose. The added drawstring is nice for adjusting the fit. The pockets are roomy which is great since he carries everything in his pockets, Of course!Overall, these are great looking pants, high quality, and I will be back for more!! I like them so much j might have to buy myself a pair!!??I absolutely love these pants. They're really comfy, the color stays, the length could be longer, but I can live with what there is. I was always told that, You get what you pay for! And I totally believe it. These pants are AWESOME!They fit good and are comfortable, but they are so thin they are practically useless.

(I had hair down past my bra strap in the back) I bought this wig to get married in next week and I haven't cut the lace yet, but it's extremely beautiful. It is soooooo soft and just the right length to be manageable and to enhance my wedding day lewk. I'm super pleased with my purchase and they threw in a free pair of lashes to boot.

COMFORT FOODS FOR ANYTIME CRAVINGS: The Quest Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Protein bar is a sweet treat, without all the sugar, you can enjoy whenever you want to satisfy your sweet tooth.. Box contains 12 Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough flavored Quest Protein BarsI hate seeing all of the negative commends about these bars. I think they are AWESOME. I have never seen any mold or other foreign objects in my bars, such as other reviewers posted, and they are always the perfect texture. These are the best when you want a sweet treat but are on a high protein (20g protein!) or restricted carb diet (such as Keto- our family counts net carbs, and these bars only have FOUR!). The chewiness, combined with the crunch of the cookies inside, makes these seem like a forbidden treat when dieting. I highly recommend you at least give these a try if you've seen the negative reviews. These are awesome, and so are the apple pie and oatmeal chocolate chip bars!I hope you found my review helpful. If you did, please click the YES button. Thank you!Quest are the best. High in protein, little to no sugar and carbs and easily some of the best tasting bars out there.BEST FLAVORS:1) Birthday Cake2) Cookies and Cream3) Peanut Butter Supreme4) Rocky Road5) Blueberry MuffinWORST FLAVORS (do not buy):1) Vanilla Almond2) Apple Pie3) Strawberry CheesecakePRO TIP: If you have time warm them up in the microwave for a few seconds. Maybe 5-10 depending on your microwave.Okay. So I�m a bit confused. I originally tasted a store bought birthday cake quest bar and was blown away by how good it was. So I purchased a whole box online from here. When it came in, I noticed it tasted not as good, and I figured it was just me forgetting how it tasted a little bit. However, upon closer inspection, I realized there were some clear differences. First off, there�s an obvious difference in size and even colour. Secondly, the taste is a bit plasticky. Third, they�re so hard it�s almost impossible to chew. The store bought one I compared it to was soft, and tasted like birthday cake (as much as it can). The amazon bought one was hard and tasted just gross. What�s going on here? Quality control please!I have these bars on subscription and generally get through two boxes a month. From an ingredient point of view they are one of the best on the market. However just opened a box, well in date and found my bar with mold on it, not impressed - attached pic. will not buy anymore via AmazonListen to the other reviewers!!! The formula changed, and it now has poor quality that causes a lot of digestion issues. In addition, I too have experienced issues with the mold, and I have purchased the bars from many vendors other than Amazon, both online and in store. In fact, one time I found a piece of metal in the bar. When I contacted the company and sent pictures, they accused me off putting the metal in the bar, but ultimately blamed their vendors and dismissed it as an issue.One last note, if you are gluten free, they have changed many products to now be labeled with the combined facility/ equipment label. I wonder how long before they all will have it. If you're sensitive like I am, this is a big issue.For years, I used to use several quest products daily, but after all of that, I have eliminated their product from my world. With that many issues and passive concern, it is a real safety issue!Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Tastes like cookie dough
-Packed with chocolate chips
-21g protein

-People have found mold and foreign objects in the bars

SWEET WITHOUT ALL THE SUGAR: Enjoy the sweet taste of a chocolate milkshake with less than 1g of sugar. Canister contains - 45 scoops of Quest Chocolate Milkshake flavored protein powderI periodically do a Keto diet to manage my weight. This product really appealed to me for its absence of carbs. And WOW the flavor is like a vanilla bean milkshake� I drink this for breakfast and dinner and it�s helped me with my weight lossAs a person who bought this for weightloss/maintenance. I was skeptical about buying this brand due to hype of certain brands but I can assure you that the QUEST brand did not disappoint in the least. It was an easy mix with a shaker bottle. Not clumpy or or caked to the inside of the bottle once liquid was introduced. The main reason that I buy and keep going back to this brand is that it carries the slow absorbing Micellar Casein protein in its recipe. I have tried a bunch of other protein shakes but this is the one that offers me the consistency with unsweetened almond milk that I need to cure my hunger pains whether I'm having it for a meal or before bed. It sounds silly but trust me, I've tried A LOT of different proteins powders and this one isn't one that my body had to get used to, it just worked to satisfy my cravings. There was no aftertaste or grittyness for the few months that I've been buying this brand and I am extremely pleased. My only disappointment is that it chocolate milkshake has a tendency to be bought out first because it's fantastic.??3oz coconut water, then 7oz regular water, baby spinach, 2 scoops of Quest chocoloate milkshake protein powder, a scoop of chia seeds, a small scoop of cocoa powder, frozen mixed berries(from Costco), 8oz nonfat greek yogurt, and ice. This makes roughly 45oz of amazing tasting protein shake(depending on how much ice you use. The Quest protein powder blends in great, and the whole shake like this tastes amazing. You 100% can not taste any spinach as well.This is the best tasting protein shake I�ve tried. If you want low carb and no sugar and nice amount of protein this is the one for you. Very disappointed they raised their price by $14 might have to find another brand.Wish I didn't wait too long to return this didn't realize it was full of harmful chemical Sucralose.

Text: Rustic styling; gray barnwood appearance (NOT ACTUAL BARNWOOD); smooth laminate wrap finish. Frame includes: white matting, clear acrylic facing, rigid cardboard backing and wire hanging hardware kit (some assembly required). Matted frame is designed to display a 13 x 19 inch photo/print/poster (matting will overlap image by 1/4 inch on each side). Frame will display a 17 x 22 inch photo/print/poster without the matting (frame lip will overlap image by 1/4 inch on each side).. Frame moulding is 1.25 inches wide; solid MDF construction. Frame is designed for WALL HANGING only (hanging hardware allows for portrait or landscape orientation)I was so happy to find the perfect sized frame in a dark wood tone to match my other frames. I needed this one for a giant diploma of my great aunt's from 1918. I painted the mat with rustoleum 2x paint to match my d�cor and I love the final look. This will preserve a great piece of family history.This arrived(for an anniversary photo gift) on time. THAT is where the positives end. The frame was slightly damaged on one corner(crushed in like the box it arrived in). There is nothing pre attached to the frame to enable handling. No predrilled holes for screws. Nothing. Save your money, spend $20 more on something of moderate quality. This frame directly represents its low cost. 1) it�s not going to look symmetrical and looks like plastic covered particle board 2) the money you save on the purchase will cost you once you�re busy drilling and measuring for 20 mins just to attach a picture wire.My husband�s grandmother painted a beautiful picture on a 20x24 canvas and we wanted to get a frame to protect it, but thought we�d have to go somewhere to get a custom size. Thankfully we found this frame and it had the rustic look we were going for as well, and it fits his grandmother�s painting perfectly! It arrived free of damage and was a great price.I�m so glad that I purchased these frames. They already come with a mat, so I didn�t have to purchase that separately, and it looks perfect with the prints I put in them. The quality of the frames is better than I expected for the price so that was great too.

No glass so you can easily take it off the wall to add new places. Fun! You could also use it for other documents. Magnets on top and bottom holds document in place.The magnets are strong enough to hold my heavier stock poster. They even automatically align with one another so the wood pieces are flush with one another. Love this frame and I will buy more.This gives my map such a nice look to it! It looks so much better than if I were to just hang my map up on the wall. It is great quality, and came the next day after ordering it!!I've bought several of these to hang large-format artwork. And I will likely buy more, until I find a better substitute or until I have time to make my own. These would be absolutely perfect if they were either less money (say $20), or if the quality was better. I've received more than one set that were badly warped � so much that the magnets barely grab and the wood is totally out of alignment. I also doubt the ""leather"" strap will last long as it stretches significantly when the artwork is hung (and I'm using very thin, light-weight paper prints). So, either step-up on the quality control, or drop the price some. I'll start working on my own version at home someday .... until then, I just ordered another set of these overpriced, warped ones with the flimsy straps. That's the price I pay for being too lazy to find an alternative I guess.Purchased two of these wooden magnetic frames with hanger for National Park scratch-off maps (maps from another company). Order came quickly. Although it came with no directions, it snapped together quickly with husband's help. Seems sturdy. Comes in different sizes. Magnets seem strong. Poster is sized 32 by 23 inches.Pro's:","Pro's:

Emerson Quiet Kool window air conditioner was designed with Smart-Fit dimensions, meaning it will fit any 23 inch to 26 inch window you haveI'M WRITING THIS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE I HAVE TO SHOUT-TYPE OVER THE NOISE OF THIS THING SO YOU'LL HEAR ME!! I FEEL SUCKERED IN BY THE ""QUIET-KOOL"" LOGO ON IT. THIS AIR CONDITIONER IS LOUDER THAN A PRISON RIOT WHEN IT RUNS.I THREW IT IN THE WINDOW WITH EASE BECAUSE IT IS SO LIGHT. THAT IS WHEN I NOTICED I CAN SEE LIGHT THROUGH THE BACK OF WHERE THE FAN IS. THE ENTIRE INSIDE DUCTWORK IS STYROFOAM, NOT EVEN THE CHEAPEST OF RIGID PLASTICS, STYROFOAM!!WHEN I TURNED IT ON I THOUGHT IT WAS LOUD, BUT IT WAS ABOUT TO GET EVEN LOUDER. I CRANKED IT TO MAXIMUM AND THE COMPRESSOR KICKED ON WITH A BIG DRONING NOISE THAT IN NO WAY WAS ""QUIET"" LIKE THE LABEL SAYS.THEN, A MOMENT LATER, THE PLASTIC FACE STARTED TO VIBRATE AS BAD AS ONE OF THOSE CRAPPY LITTLE HONDAS WITH 1,000,000 WATTS OF BASE SHAKING ALL THE PLASTIC TRIM ON THE CAR. I DUCT TAPED THE BOTTOM TIGHTLY DOWN AND AROUND THE BOTTOM OF THE UNIT TO STOP THAT VIBRATION.NOW THE FILTER IS VIBRATING LOUDLY BEHIND THE GRILLE. I CAN'T TAPE THAT IN PLACE, SO I SLID IT OUT AND TRIED TO DEFORM IT SO IT WOULD SLIDE IN NICE AND TIGHT. I BROKE IT INSTEAD. IT SEEMS TO VIBRATE THE LEAST IF IT SLIDE IT ONLY HALFWAY IN. WE'RE DOING GREAT NOW....WE TRIED TO SLEEP WITH IT ON LAST NIGHT. TRIED. THE DRONE FROM THIS THING WAS PENETRATING MY SKULL AND GIVING ME A HEADACHE, BUT I WAS HOT, SO I PERSEVERED.EVERYTIME THE COMPRESSOR KICKED ON IT WAS SO LOUD AND ABRUPT THAT I WOKE UP, EVERYTIME.THE CONTROL GOES UP TO 7. SEVEN?? YES, SEVEN. AND THAT'S NOT VERY COLD EITHER. I'M NOT SURE WHICH PISSES ME OFF MORE, THE NOISE OR THE FACT I'M BEING KEPT FROM GETTING COOL ENOUGH. EXCUSE ME, ""KOOL"" ENOUGH.I NOT ONLY WANT TO PULL THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW, I WANT TO TIE IT TO MY JEEP AND DRAG IT AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO PUNISH IT.Excellent air conditioner. I'm over 60 years old and had no trouble installing this window air conditioner into a window that is at eye level. Cooled down a 200 square foot room in less than 8 minutes (in 90 degree heat!). It is so quiet you don't think it's running.Bought this to augment the central air in a front bedroom suite that has sun all day long. Room is 275 sq ft. Installed by one person in less than 30 minutes with just screwdriver and drill. Side louvers just need some tape to seal outside air. The unit came with some insulation and it was enough to do most of the job. Very simple unit. Does great job of cooling off this large room (in addition to central air). Price is right. Came in a sturdy box with adequate insulation. Weighs under 40 lb and is easy for one person to handle. It does help to have two people when installing. One to position unit and another working the sash. It is noisier than some other units that were much more $$. For the price it cannot be beat.Air conditioners don't add coolness they remove heat. There must be adequate hot air exhaust to remove heat from a room. Add an assist fan on the hot air side (condenser) to improve cooling. I used this in a very hot space without enough exhaust air and it blew hot air. I added an assist fan and it blows 55 degree air in a100 degree space. So far so good.I have owned this for five very muggy days, and I am more than pleased. It has worked well at night time, too, when the air outside was in the low 70's and humid. Super simple to operate. Easy to assemble the accordian style window spacer/bracket. The right size for our room (around 120 square feet). At the coldest setting, the room was 68 degrees, which is definitely more than cool enough for us. I consider it to be very quiet; my son sleeps well with it on. There is no remote, no electronic controls, just dial controls. It comes with a GFCI plug, too, as with other air conditioners. This appears to be, but I have not confirmed, the exact same air conditioner as the Haier, Frigidaire, and other 5,000 BTU models, just with a different brand name. I was pleasantly surprised that it came with a foam insert strip for filling in the air holes around its installed location. Warranty is one year parts and service, two years parts only. It does not come with a stand for supporting its weight outside the window. It may not need it because it is relatively small for an air conditioner (I have never seen one smaller, actually). I made my own support out of wood, just to be extra safe in my 4 year old's room. I would also reccomend a window stop for the lower casement window for extra safety around children.Pro's:","Pro's:

EASY TO INSTALL, NO HEAVY WINDOW UNIT TO LIFT - Our portable AC measures 17.9 x 15 x 30.7 inches and has wheels so it can be easily moved to any room that has a window accessible. Simply attach the hose and the window slide adapter, plug in the power supply and you�re good to go. Most customers are able to install in 8 minutes or less. At the end of a season or when you don�t need it, simply unhook the unit and store in your closet, basement or garage. WASHABLE AIR FILTER AND REMOTE CONTROL - Keep your air clean and your portable AC running efficiently with the included washable filter. The filter indicator light will illuminate to remind you when to clean the air filter. We recommend you clean the filter approximately once every two weeks. The unit also comes with a remote control to quickly set your desired temperature, fan speed, change cooling modes or activate the sleep featurenanOur downstairs AC went out and we needed an immediate solution for our main floor, which is roughly 1700 sq. ft.. We started with an LG that cost $100 more than this unit (from our local big box hardware store). The LG was pretty and small, but totally wonky to operate. It relied on the remote for controlling the unit (a huge negative in my opinion), and simply didn�t work. It never shut off, even with the timer.We returned it and went with this unit due to the great reviews. Plus it was $100 cheaper and a bit more powerful. We weren�t a fan of the white, but it might be perfect for certain rooms. I wish they offered a darker color... I.e., charcoal,gray.Here are some notes from our experience:- installation was simple. The corrugated tube is long, and I particularly like the way it exits the window insert as a full circle, not a narrowed oval. Its a larger tube than the LG... looks like 6� or so. That should help the efficiency. The tube is a little too flexible though... it will sag to the floor which hurts airflow. The LG had a stiffer tube that held its shape better. The window insert is simple and effective, but we had to cut one piece to make it fit our 32�W window. Kind of surprising, since that�s a common size. But I preferred this to the LG system, which was 4 pieces that were very confusing and left air leaks. I was surprised that there was no grate on the exit side of the tube... to keep bugs and birds out. We bought some window screen and glued it to the outside of the outlet, which worked perfectly.- it�s very quiet... much quieter than the LG. I don�t think it blows as hard as the LG, but it blows hard enough and I prefer quiet over air speed. It keeps our 500 sq. ft. Main room very cool and the rest of the first floor (1700 sq. ft.) plenty comfortable (we use ceiling fans to help move the air around).- IT HAS CONTROLS ON THE UNIT ITSELF. This is simply a must in my opinion. Remotes get lost, break, etc, etc, and I wouldn�t want my AC to become useless if the remote breaks. The LG had only the simplest controls on the unit itself. A negative of the Homelabs system is that when you power up the remote it completely overrides the settings on the unit itself. You kind of have to decide whether you�ll use the remote or the direct buttons... they don�t get along with each other, and the device can get confused if you try to use both (at one point we had to reset the machine because some of the controls weren�t responding after using the remote and the direct buttons together � like most electronics you can reset it by plugging it in while holding the on button down for 3 seconds or so). We favor the direct buttons and don�t use the remote.- the controls are well thought out and function well. The timer can be set for both start up and shut down (the LG could only do one or the other) and it can be set in 30-minute increments (the LG was 60-minutes). The unit will not shut off after the set temperature is reached, which I find odd. The LG was the same. Both units only slow down... perhaps only the fan is running? But I would prefer it if the entire unit shut down when the temperature is reached.- customer service is prompt, pleasant and helpful. We had a shipping issue and they were quick to offer help without hesitation. A definite plus here compared to LG (which has earned a reputation for miserable customer service).All in all were very happy ... it�s a great portable AC and notably better than an LG.UPDATE: we liked it so much we bought a second one... both are running flawlessly every day and have gotten us through the hot southern summer. We�ll get our main HVAC unit fixed in the winter when rates are cheaper.UPDATE 2: when we bought our first one there was maybe 15 reviews... by the second one there was 50 reviews. Now there�s over 300 and it�s still getting great reviews. That says something I think.I thought I�d mention one thing we had to deal with (not a negative, just something to be aware of). We live in Georgia, which can be sweltering hot and humid. If we ran this unit all day we would occasionally see evidence of a small amount of water that had leaked from beneath (we weren�t running it in dehumidify mode). I have to stress this was not a lot of water, and did no damage to our wood floors, but we decided to place the unit on a plastic tray just in case. We used a clear lid from one of those storage bins that we had lying around... worked perfectly, and actually looked like it was part of the device.Still 5 stars for both our devices... they will pay for themselves in the savings we can get from shopping around for AC service in early spring (it�s crazy competitive down here).UPDATE 3: Just bought a third, all working great. Some day we'll get that main HVAC fixed, but no time to think about it nowEdited to add: Using Internet sources for calculating cooling needs, it seems the problem with this unit is inadequate airflow. A 600 square foot room needs airflow of at least 540 CFM. This unit only flows 80 CFM (4.5"" X 5.5"" cold air output; 5.4"" exhaust). Although the BTU rating of 14,000 would be adequate up to 700 sq ft, the minuscule air flow only supports rooms less than 100 sq ft (10 ft by 10 ft). Compare this unit's 80 CFM airflow to window air conditioners with the same BTU rating -- for example, a 14K BTU window AC from GE puts out 470 CFM.Installed in my well-insulated 600 square foot garage with insulated ducting to exhaust the warm air. The drain didn't work properly, so I had to prop up the front end with a 2x4. It ran continuously for 48 hours without getting the air temp below 85 degrees on either Cool or Auto setting. It did remove moisture from the air. After propping up the front, it pushed out 12 to 15 gallons of water in 48 hours. The air temperature at the swinging outlet registers 68 degrees on my laser thermometer after the unit ran a few hours. That isn't nearly cold enough for 600 sq ft. Maybe 100? The merchant wants me to pay return shipping, which is incredible for a defective unit. I don't recommend buying this unit or any portable AC unless you have a very small room to cool.nannanPro's:","Pro's:

Easy, beautiful and elegant, this black aluminum alloy is great for home living room, bedroom, office, cafe and more.I knew I was buying just the frame but:-One star has been deducted because it came with a piece of hard plastic that actually would have made a great substitute for a glass pane adding some extra protection. But it's completely unusable because it's printed all over with the recycle symbol. I could have used this and now it seems like a waste.-The second star was deducted because the way the photo is held on place makes it extremely hard to use with command strips.The plastic face cover is marred with scratches and blotches. Although there was a protective film on one side, the other side had marks. The cardboard insert is thin so the metal grommets show under the poster. If you decide to purchase the frame, I suggest using a mounting board or some layer of padding. I regret moving ahead with framing my poster as it's now ruined.This frame is made very cheaply, a very thin piece of plexiglass, some cardboard and a flimsy frame�worth $5 at best.Perfect for the use of my completed puzzles. Love that I am able to do my puzzle in the frameI originally bought this to frame a puzzle and it fits perfectly! Highly recommend. The frame does not take away from the puzzle and isn�t too flashy!

Text: 100% high quality synthetic leather for extended service life. multi-density foam for better absorption of shocks. full attached thumb to reduce the risk of twisting. large velcro enclosure for a secure fit. Included components: Pair of Boxing GlovesI bought these gloves for combatives sparring and working a heavy bag.The price was good, the brand is well known, and they look pretty cool too. They arrived, and I strapped them on and beat on my heavy bag for a while. I'm very happy with the padding and the fit.The only gripe? The VENUM patch on the strap was installed upside down on one of the gloves. Took me a while to notice it, so it's not a glaring issue. But for the price I paid, it doesn't bother me. And if my opponent notices, it just means I'm not hitting him hard enough :)I was looking for pair of Boxing gloves for my older sister and I was looking browsing around and found these pair and like the design and the price. Read the reviews a d was very convinced to make the purchase.Bought these for my older sister that started to do boxing at her gym.At the beginning she wasn't convinced about these boxing gloves because they weren't a brand name that are more popular in Mexico.Then she started using them and love it so far and even I got her these pair on 2019,still going strong.My sister do boxing five times a week at the gym.I attached the pics on how they look now.I totally recommend this product.I haven�t been using these for very long, so I�ll have to wait and see how durability is. My first impressions are good though. The gloves fit well, feel supportive of the wrists, and the shape of the glove allows for a good natural connection to the bag while punching. I switched from Ringside because the shape of the Ringside gloves seemed to force my pinky and ring finger knuckles to connect first which was causing a lot of bloodied knuckles and poor punches. I�ve been boxing for almost a decade now and for a cheap pair of bag gloves, these are my new favorite.These are entry-level gloves from a major brand. They look very cool, but they lack padding and any meaningful ventilation.My knuckles were taking quite a beating from even not that intense work. I had to return them and get the Elite version. The Elites turned out to be twice as expensive, but also twice better with respect to padding, wrist support, and ventilation.My favorite marvel villain venom which means I had to get these. I see pros use it...it must be good. And it is. After nearly breaking my wrist with the crap everlast sent with their 100 pound bag it was clear I needed something better. 2 days later Venum!! I was so happy to go all out and make proper hooks. I lost weight using this everyday for at least 30 mins just remember to take that water break and limit sun/heat exposure it's been hot y'all.Pro's:","Pro's:

BUILT FOR COMFORT WITH A TAILORED FIT: The pre-curved ergonomic pocket, grip bar and proper thumb position ensure proper fist closure and alignment � sizes 10 oz 12 oz, 14 oz, and 16 oz.. SUPPORT YOU CAN TRUST: The single strap works in tandem with the splinted wrist support to deliver a secure, protective fit that prevents risky and damaging bends. PADDED KNUCKLE PROTECTION: Most starter gloves don�t fully protect your hands. S4 delivers splinted wrist support and cushioning foam to keep you properly protected while you hone your technique.. PACKAGE CONTENTS: 1 pair of S4 Boxing Gloves. S4 is perfect for training, sparring, kickboxing, combat sports, taekwondo, kickboxing, MMA, muay thai, and martial arts.I go to ILoveKickboxing four times a week and punch for 45 mins each day. I have used and have different gloves from Sanabul 12 oz, Title Gel 10 oz and Sanabul 16oz. I wanted to upgrade to a premium glove since I�m using them more and read reviews for Hayabusa T3. The reviews were amazing and I�m sure they are every bit as good as the reviews mentioned; but I wasn�t ready to spend $140 on new gloves. Thankfully they came out with an entry level model!The gloves are snug and very well padded all around. I usually wear gel hand wraps with my other gloves; but with the padding on these gloves I don�t wear wraps or gloves. It had great wrist support and again the padding absorbs the hits. I have a heavy hand Especially when I�m punching the bag for power; after last nights round my hands did not feel sore. These gloves let me rebound faster and hit harder. The weight is also nice and balanced.I�m going to keep these for awhile before upgrading to the white Hayabusa T3 in the future incentive I hit my goals for this year.I expected great things from this glove given the brand name and reputation so far. I'm a decently handy boxer that just wanted some cheaper gloves that gave my hands some cushion first off right away I could tell these gloves we're too snug the 16 oz L and I'm not even that big of a guy 5'10 205 and there was not even enough cushion to go at a heavybag. I have Sanabul boxing gloves bottom of the rung ones that are falling apart and insulation flowing out of them yet they are more comfortable and have better punch absorbing abilities and my knuckles unpadded on one part. I would recommend heavier hitters and bigger guys to pass in this I wouldn't recommend this glove the 16 oz Lg ones for anyone over 165. And also getting hit with these probably hurt more than being hit barehanded handed stiff as a 2x4. I'm very dissapointed couldn't even finish my session with these had to switch back to my ancient and falling apart Sanabul boxing gloves which somehow felt betterI'm fairly new to boxing and am definitely not a subject matter expert but have used a few pairs of training gloves and these are by far my favorites. The first couple of times I hit the heavy bag with them they definitely felt tight and weird (for lack of a better term) but they broke in quickly and are now my go-to gloves for heavy bag work. These provide much more wrist support than my Sanabul training gloves and are snug but comfortable on my 5'11 male-sized hands. Honestly I cannot tell what on earth all the people who left 1 star reviews are talking about, as I have experienced none of it.That being said, I would have rated this product 2 or 3 stars had I written the review after my first heavy bag session, when they were not properly broken in. Other training gloves I've used have felt more or less ""natural"" right out of the box, while these definitely take some time.I love my new gloves! Also, for what it's worth, they look much prettier than my old ones, and the wine color is pretty baller! That being said if you are looking for a nice pair of training gloves, the Sanabul Essentials glove is also a good choice for heavy bag sessions. I believe they are considerably cheaper than these gloves, but won't do much to support your wrist so wrap your hands well :)Like many of these reviews mention, when I first got these gloves they were *snug*. Like in a concerningly, ""Do I have to return these?"", kind of way. I figured I'd at least give them a try first, and after a few good workouts (call it less than an hour on the bag) they really loosened up and are now far more comfortable. I imagine as they get some more punches in them they'll break in even further.I've only had these a couple of weeks, so can't properly evaluate durability yet, but so far I'm very pleased with these gloves! When these do eventually break down (assuming that's at least a year or two away) I'd likely want to invest in the high-end Hayabusa gloves.The gloves are AMAZING! I love the feel of them and the fact that they are so padded. The microfiber thumb is awesome for wiping off sweat. The second elastic is tight on my forearm (sadly they are a bit bigger), but I read a review that that was clipped off and it was perfectly fine. I'll try and see if it that works.The only, ONLY, downside was the fact that the package did not come with hand wraps. When I first found the listing I thought I saw that they come with set of wraps. Upon reading reviews I saw multiple pictures/ cases where wraps were included. When I received my order, and the wraps were not included, I was disappointed. Further investigation proved that the wraps were included at random and not in every order.Thankfully, I already had a set, but I was looking forward to this brand to see if I like them better. Looks like I'll have to order a set later.Pro's:","Pro's: 
- Comfortable and supportive
- Pre-curved ergonomic pocket
- Single strap for secure fit
- Padded knuckle protection
- Good wrist support
Con's: 
- May be too snug for some people

We put it together with no issues. Instructions were easy to figure out, all the material was well labeled and available. It took us about 2 hours to put together, but it was my sons first build and I was letting him lead the �build,� it probably would have taken less time for someone who had more experience assembling furniture. It was an excellent piece for him to put together for his first furniture assembly. It was not complicated. It is sturdy, and has a very clean design and makes the before chaos of his hobbled together desks look so much better organized and clean. I�m very impressed with the quality of the desk and feel it was well worth the money. He is very satisfied with the desk and how much it cost him.I would definitely recommend this desk to anyone with a mid sized room.

If you are looking for something that is not too big, bulky, or busy, this is a great bang for the buck.Purchased this for a gaming set up. Turned out really good . Feels pretty sturdy . Love the built in power strip to charge my phone . Assembly was okay could be better. Some of it you had to force together, but don�t let that hold you back. I would buy it again.This is perfect for what I needed. Some reviews mentioned that it could not extend to the full length. As you can see it�s possible but you have to be VERY VERY careful when it comes to the leg braces. Unfortunately the manual is not as helpful as it should be but after careful analyzing the legs and looking at the pieces needed I was able to accomplish it.

The first day of the event there was moderate wind at 16mph for the high. The tent was secured with sandbags and ground steaks but the wind ripped 2 walls where they were attached (not happy but figured I will repair it and deal with it).The next day the fair had to rearrange locations and again moderate 16mph winds. In this location I also secured with sandbags and ground steaks and the walls were ripping more. The worst part was when my entire tent blew over and knocked over my airbrush tattoo equipment!! It also knocked into my neighbors tent!! I had a loss that day as I had to pack up and leave because my equipment is very sensitive and had to be worked on after getting knocked over by this flimsy tent!!! We left for vacation right after that and just returned and now that I am home I wanted to start the return process to find out my return WI dow closed on July 4th!!! IT IS NOT OK TO HAVE USED THIS TENT APROX 5 HOURS (3 hrs evening event and only 2 hrs the following days event) AND NOT BE ABLE TO RETURN IT FOR THE POOR QUALITY AND MY LOSS THE DAY OF THE SHOW!!I so hope the seller does right by this and will refund...btw this is my first ever amazon return from all my purchases. And I planned on using this for events through summer and fall.....We purchased this for our recent camping trip and we are so happy we purchased it!! Product quality is really top notch. Set up was so easy that three pre teenagers set the canopy up in 10-15 minutes!! The top of the canopy is very sturdy and well built. The side panels are bit thin but that was not an issue. The windows on the side panel are really a nice feature they make sure you don�t feel claustrophobic. The stands/legs are well built and finished with powder coat. It came with sand bags which we didn�t use as it was not required anyways for our purposes. This product came with stakes and they were enough to hold it down. The only thing we couldn�t validate was how would it hold up in the rain as the weather was awesome and it never rained during our camping!! I would really recommend this for anyone looking for an amazing canopy without breaking your bank a/c!!Great and easy to set up. We are using it for our wedding for me to wait in while people get seated at the ceremony since we are doing at the park.But it�s very nice and seems pretty steady. And it come with weight bags to hold it down too if you are not on grass.The best part about this tent is that rain really does run off and not pool on the top. I have had a few tents ruined with one heavy rainfall. This tent is tight; the water does not pool up. We leave it up on our deck all Summer (screw it down to keep from blowing away). We enjoy this tent every day!Found a rip in the wall first time putting up. It's easy to put up and take down. I don't think it was worth what I paid with the shoddy manufacturing.Edit: the customer service was great. They fixed my issue in a timely manner. Satisfied with my purchase.Pro's:","Pro's:

We had water droplets form all over the roof. Everything under the tent eventually got wet. For shade and privacy awesome. To use with any chance of rain NOT RECOMMENDED..UPDATE #1: I first want to say I have been in customer service for 34 years. The customer service I received from this company after writing my 1st review has been OUTSTANDING. They have gone out of their way to make things right. Today I got our replacement and we are heading out this weekend Camping and we will be using the tent again in the rain. After this weekend I will write a update on how the tent holds up it with the rain.UPDATE #2: We used the tent this weekend with a little rain. I can report that we had no rain droplets form inside of the roof.When our package arrived, we asked a son-in-law to assist us in the assembly. When he was delayed, my wife and I elected to see how far we could go without help. 20 minutes later it was completely assembled. Be forewarned - the instructions are minimal, but, with a little logic, it is more than viable. We plan to use it for socially distancing entertaining while we buckle under. Looking forward to the day when its function will be no longer necessary.Easy to put up alone, but collapse after a few days. Worked as a paint booth, but wouldn't recomend it for staying out of any type of weather.

Small or medium business NAS systems in a 24x7 environmentThe drive was shipped properly ESD covered and floating between end caps snug-fitted inside a cardboard box and enclosed in a large bubble wrap envelope. Done right. This is the biggest unknown buying drives online.Manufactured in Jan 2021, this seems to be an update to the more common and popular EFRX CMR drive relabeled Red Plus. It has 128mb cache double that of the EFRX. Not sure the performance gainin practice. This model is too new to have published benchmarks.An overnight write and read of every block before use surfaced no bad blocks/sectors. So far so good.Avoid, Please read before buying.Long time WD user, long enough that I know when something stinks.... partly due to the fact I usually buy directly from WD and know what the product looks like.I got this (1TB RED) in and the first thing I look at is the date, yes, all drives have a built on date. Received this drive on 3/28/19, but drive has a 13 Oct 2014 date on it.... first warring sign.Still not 100% against the drive, who knows... could be new- old stock. Quick look at the spindle motor (pictured side by side with a WD black purchased direct from WD) shows my next worry.... refurbished?Third strike was a quick warranty check on WD's web site (Not sure if amazon allows links here, so ask and I'll link you too it). WD shows this as an OEM product without warranty from them.Now, given the OEM status, build date and poor ""glue"" job on the motor connectors, I've got a pretty good picture of what I received.Now, I've use WD's products for years, what's going on with THIS drive, well.... I'll let you draw your own conclusions from the facts I've given.Used this drive to increase the storage on a TiVo Roamio from 1TB to 2TB. I've had flawless performance from WD hard drives in all the TiVos I have owned. The previous drive was also a WD Red Plus. This drive has a larger cache but I doubt that makes any difference.It came well-packaged and I was able to copy the old drive's contents to it using a USB3.0 dual dock and the MFSTools software. Everything worked and the drive was correctly expanded to 2TB.One note is that the drive label does not look like the one in the picture. WD apparently has changed the label but it's the correct drive that I ordered.Over the last 10 to 15 years I've had far better reliability from WD drives than that other brand that starts with an ""S"", and these drives seem very nice so far (albeit they're only a week old). Be AWARE though, that on the 12 TB model THE ACTUAL CAPACITY IS ONLY 10.91 TB -- which surprised me! (yeah I know hard drive manufacturers often take some rounding liberties with advertised capacity -- but rounding up to the next nearest even whole number is a new rounding method for me!).We had a 2TB drive that failed a SMART check, so it was time for an upgrade. Being that this was not going to be used for an OS drive, only data, I decided to go with a NAS type drive. Best decision I've ever made. These particular drives are made for long term storage and lots of reads and writes, so I can't think of a better fit for a Plex server's media data drive.One thing to remember, MBR formatted/mounted drives have a limit of 2TB so if you want Windows to see this disk at 1 continuous 4TB drive, you'll need to make sure you use GPT. You can use MBR, but Windows will force you to partition the drive into two separate 2TB drives. If this is over your head, you may just need to do a little research before doing the install, or possibly you shouldn't be swapping/installing this drive yourself and should get help from an IT friend.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 16' x 16' instant cabin tent. Sleeps 12. Fits 3 queen airbeds. Sets up in under 2 minutes. 7 fully closeable windowsI had what I thought was the exact same tent about 6 years ago, so I had a pretty good idea what I was getting. However I was shocked to find that the poles now come attached to the tent. This makes setting up the tent and taking it down much easier and I was even able to get it back in the bag.A few recomendations. Set you tent up before you use it the first time. It will probably take two people about 30 mins to set it up the first time as there is a bit of a learning curve. Once it's set up, spray it down with a silicone spray to ensure rain protection. Purchase a 20'x20' tarp that is silver on one side and black on the other. Set this up over the tent between some trees and use this instead of the rain fly. This will allow your tent to breathe much better. Also when stakeing, start with the inside corner first and work your way across the doors first. Getting the tent stretched out is key.This is an outstanding tent for the money. After reading the reviews I went ahead and prepared the tent and have some feedback. First, it is a breeze to set up. Set up the first time took about 10-15 minutes. Tear down was about 5-10 and the great thing is that after tearing down now four times I can get it to fit perfectly in the bag every time. I have set the tent up and camped in cool, warm, windy and rainy weather and have the following recommendations for you: buy a good quality tarp to fit on the ground as a base. I got a two pack from Costco for 25 dollars. Laying this out first will save your floor. Invest in some good tent stakes... I bought 10 for 12 dollars and it was well worth it. When I set the tent up I also applied seam sealer just to make sure. I had no leaks at all and I did not seal the rain fly seams either. The guy lines were just fine so no need to replace those. The pole in the very middle of the tent under the awning appears to be too short but I set/pushed it inward gently and staked down and it was great. The tent is huge... for those with the gold out queen bed cord or foldable chairs I do recommend getting some felt pads you would use for a dining room table and put those on the feet of the cots that way you won�t wear a hole into the floor. I had two adults, four kids and two dogs very comfortably in this tent. You won�t regret this purchase!We purchased this tent back in March for a camp-out that we were going to attend in July. The camp-out in July went off without a hitch and the tent folded up great for use at a later date. I pulled the tent out a couple of weeks later for my daughter's Brownie camp-out and that's when the problems began. One of the main roof poles never clicked into place...Instead, it simply became jammed or locked but never in the correct position so that the poles would actually click into place. We were able to use the tent for the evening but we knew that it wasn't set up correctly. When morning came, the entire tent collapsed. Thank goodness we were out of it by then! As we were trying to collapse the tent to put it back in the bag, we couldn't get the problem pole to collapse! So now we have a giant tent pole that won't lock into place and won't budge the other way either! After contacting the company, I was informed that there was nothing they could do to help me since I purchased it too many months ago. They were very rude and dismissive in their responses to me. They wouldn't even offer to send replacement poles so that I could attempt to fix it myself!!! Unbelievable!!!! I will NEVER purchase anything from OzarkTrail or the seller AlphaBen in the future!! What a complete and total waste of money! For the amount I paid, I certainly should have gotten more than one use out of the tent!So I bought this tent to camp with my 4 kids. We've owned an Ozark Trail tent in the past and it held up for 3 summers (probably 30 camping trips, including wind, rain and a tornado a mile away) So my expectations of this tent were high. I bought the Instant because hey, who doesn't like less hassle when putting up the tent?The set up: The directions are not clear. There are no words, just pictures you have to try and decipher. After finally getting it up we did not put the rain fly on as it was gorgeous outside.The sleep: had plenty of room for the air mattresses plus bags. Kids liked having their own entrance. We liked the extra little area outside the door that provided some shade. When I laid down and was able to look out the screened door and just see stars and lake, that was awesome. I was digging the new tent!The weather: Around 7am my phone started giving alerts to rain rolling in. I jumped up and had my oldest help me get the rain fly on. While attaching it I though ""hmmm, that's weird. Usually they attach to the pole and then you stake them down"" This rain fly attaches to the tent, in a little loop, sewed into the seam, then you stake it down. So we get them all hooked up and staked. The wind is blowing but nothing too bad. Rain comes in, so far everyone is dry. Winds about 20 mph, nothing my old tent hadn't weathered before and I had high expectations for this one! My kiddo inside says ""mom, something is hitting the tent"" I walk to the back corner and see that the stake had come loose and the rope was hitting the tent. So I grab the rope about the time a gust of wind (25-30mph) comes thru and rips 1-the rope out of my hand and 2-it ripped the tent. That weird hook for the rainfly? Yeah, it ripped right a that point, all the way up the seam. The corner of the tent just flapping in the wind.I am so disappointed. This tent was not worth the money. I expected much more, especially for the money that was spent. I strongly advise against anyone purchasing this tent! There was no reason for it to rip. The other tents around us held up well. This one is poorly designed!I do a lot of camping and this tent is a great addition to the equipment we use. It really only takes about three minutes to set this tent up once you get used to how it unfolds it really only takes three minutes it has very good inside netting so the mosquitoes are a minimal issue. This is a very solid product and it�s very roomy and spacious and has high ceilings great design I recommend it for anyone who wants to do camping during the three seasons, but please do not try to use this during the winter.Pro's:","Pro's:

When i contacted the company they said they wouldn't back up their product outside of 90 days. All the cheap Everlast gloves I've ever used have out lasted these gloves by a considerable amount of time. Save your money. This glove is worthless.Lo primero que tiene que saber es que el color no se parece en nada a las im�genes de la publicidad como se puede ver en la primera fotograf�a. En segundo lugar, los guantes son m�s ligeros que el peso indicado, en mi caso compr� de 12 oz, pero al pesarlos en la b�scula resultaron ser de 10 oz. Tercero, los guantes se sienten muy fr�giles como si no estuvieran hechos para durar. No obstante, tengo que decir que solo se trata de la primera impresi�n. Una vez aclarado todo esto y despu�s de 3 meses de uso tengo que decir que son los mejores guantes que he probado. Son muy c�modos y las molduras hacen que se ajusten perfectamente a las manos, lo cual ayuda a reducir las peque�as lesiones que se presentan en los entrenamientos. El amarre de la mu�eca es lo mejor que he probado, se siente muy seguro y tambi�n ayuda a evitar lesiones, adem�s de que el velcro doble de la correa es de la mejor calidad. Al principio ten�a dudas sobre la calidad de la piel, pero hasta ahora ha resultado muy buena. El color se ha oscurecido con los entrenamientos, especialmente en la parte que hacen contacto con el costal y en las partes donde les cae sudor por lo que ahora el tono es m�s parecido al de la publicidad como se ve en las fotos 2 y 3. He tenido guantes Cleto Reyes y de otras marcas locales de M�xico que tambi�n son muy buenas, pero definitivamente estos son los mejores. Son caros, pero lo valen. Espero, actualizar esta descripci�n cuando cumplan un a�o.Beautiful, great-functioning gloves! These are the top of the market based on quality, comfort, fit and finish... All my tools are Hayabusa, you can't do better. The only small thing is I bought large and they were just a bit loose on the hands so I bought the Hayabusa gel hand wraps. I've never wrapped before but these are easy and comfortable to use and closed the small gap inside these gloves. They fit amazingly well now with that small adjustment. If you don't mind the healthy price, these are worth the investment!Just starting boxing about 2 months ago and needed shoes and gloves. I looked at several brands and was frankly overwhelmed. After hours on boxing websites and Amazon reviews I went with the Hyabusa gloves and shoes. The gloves fit perfectly. I didn't realize that there is a second stabilizing velcro strap under the main velcro closure, genious. I can tighten the inner one and then the outer and my wrist has been completely stabilized. Although this may a positive or negative, when you hit the heavy bag you get just a little bit of bite on the bag instead of your glove just glancing off of the bag like some really cheap polyurethane gloves do. I really like this because now I actually have a much better idea of where my punches are landing and with what force. My next gloves will be the top tier of Hyabusa gloves.I read reviews and said that sound was not great when hitting bag and that they do not look like leather. I like the sound and the leather is awesome. The old fashion look is unique and everyone in the gym loves these gloves. When we were admiring these pair of gloves, we almost forgot that we are in a global pandemic. worth every single dollar paid for these gloves.Pro's:","Pro's:

It�s a must buy!Loved it, but it wasn�t long enough. It definitely seems shorter than 16 inches, but I will be ordering another I just hope it�s the right length. It�s soft and manageable. Good qualityHair is incredibly soft & looks very real! Love how it's a normal, solid headband - not the stretchy fabric one that wraps around your entire head because they always slip off - but a headband that goes on top of the crown like ones we wore as little girls. The hair piece is not a full wig, it's 3/4 wig so for someone like me who has no hair at all, I got nervous when the hair shifted forward, the back of the head becomes exposed if you're not careful. But for people who have hair & want to use it on ""bad hair days,"" it's perfect. I wore this to a reunion where I hadn't seen my friends in 6 yrs. and EVERYONE said my hair was so pretty, how great my hair looked, etc. When I told them it's a headband wig and that I'm actually bald due to alopecia, they were SHOCKED! They all wanted to touch the hair and they all want to get one, too!! Definitely a MUST BUY!!!I really like it. I rolled it up with flexi rods just to add more bounce.Pro's:","Pro's:

When i contacted the company they said they wouldn't back up their product outside of 90 days. All the cheap Everlast gloves I've ever used have out lasted these gloves by a considerable amount of time. Save your money. This glove is worthless.Lo primero que tiene que saber es que el color no se parece en nada a las im�genes de la publicidad como se puede ver en la primera fotograf�a. En segundo lugar, los guantes son m�s ligeros que el peso indicado, en mi caso compr� de 12 oz, pero al pesarlos en la b�scula resultaron ser de 10 oz. Tercero, los guantes se sienten muy fr�giles como si no estuvieran hechos para durar. No obstante, tengo que decir que solo se trata de la primera impresi�n. Una vez aclarado todo esto y despu�s de 3 meses de uso tengo que decir que son los mejores guantes que he probado. Son muy c�modos y las molduras hacen que se ajusten perfectamente a las manos, lo cual ayuda a reducir las peque�as lesiones que se presentan en los entrenamientos. El amarre de la mu�eca es lo mejor que he probado, se siente muy seguro y tambi�n ayuda a evitar lesiones, adem�s de que el velcro doble de la correa es de la mejor calidad. Al principio ten�a dudas sobre la calidad de la piel, pero hasta ahora ha resultado muy buena. El color se ha oscurecido con los entrenamientos, especialmente en la parte que hacen contacto con el costal y en las partes donde les cae sudor por lo que ahora el tono es m�s parecido al de la publicidad como se ve en las fotos 2 y 3. He tenido guantes Cleto Reyes y de otras marcas locales de M�xico que tambi�n son muy buenas, pero definitivamente estos son los mejores. Son caros, pero lo valen. Espero, actualizar esta descripci�n cuando cumplan un a�o.Beautiful, great-functioning gloves! These are the top of the market based on quality, comfort, fit and finish... All my tools are Hayabusa, you can't do better. The only small thing is I bought large and they were just a bit loose on the hands so I bought the Hayabusa gel hand wraps. I've never wrapped before but these are easy and comfortable to use and closed the small gap inside these gloves. They fit amazingly well now with that small adjustment. If you don't mind the healthy price, these are worth the investment!Just starting boxing about 2 months ago and needed shoes and gloves. I looked at several brands and was frankly overwhelmed. After hours on boxing websites and Amazon reviews I went with the Hyabusa gloves and shoes. The gloves fit perfectly. I didn't realize that there is a second stabilizing velcro strap under the main velcro closure, genious. I can tighten the inner one and then the outer and my wrist has been completely stabilized. Although this may a positive or negative, when you hit the heavy bag you get just a little bit of bite on the bag instead of your glove just glancing off of the bag like some really cheap polyurethane gloves do. I really like this because now I actually have a much better idea of where my punches are landing and with what force. My next gloves will be the top tier of Hyabusa gloves.I read reviews and said that sound was not great when hitting bag and that they do not look like leather. I like the sound and the leather is awesome. The old fashion look is unique and everyone in the gym loves these gloves. When we were admiring these pair of gloves, we almost forgot that we are in a global pandemic. worth every single dollar paid for these gloves.Pro's:","Pro's: 
- high quality leather
- world renowned wrist support
- precise dual-strap fit
- high-impact protection
- sophisticated inner lining
Con's: 
- color does not match advertisement
- gloves are lighter than indicated weight

Text: This 12""x18"" frame perfectly showcases your cherished memories or favorite photographs. Profile of each frame is 1.125"" wide with a gray woodgrain finish. Each frame is made of MDF wood with plastic styrene front to prevent breakage. Frames include pre-attached sawtooth hangers for vertical or horizontal wall hanging. Easy to open turn buttons make adding your photograph a breezenanThese are perfect frames. I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color. Overall I'm happy with the purchase! Doesn't look or feel like cheap frame material, so I think it's worth the price.Pro's:","Pro's:

First off I ordered two of the same thing at the same time (10 x 10 matted to 6 x 6), and I got two totally different sizes shipped in the mail (see photo). Second, the frame that was supposedly the same size as I ordered actually isn't. I ordered a 10 x 10 and what showed up was an 11 x 11 (see photo). Third, the quality is not good. The front of one of them was dinged up on arrival and the other one the little pegs on the back of the frame won't all fit in the way they're supposed to, only half of them work. The cheap frames at Walmart are better quality - just go with that if you need something inexpensive - I'm returning mine.I have no idea why they didn't just include some clips on the back that we could attach wire or string to on our own. The ""seamless"" hanger has this one tiny piece of plastic you're supposed to attach the picture to. The weight of the picture bears down directly on this ridiculously flimsy piece. The first one broke immediately, leaving this white lump of a ""seamless"" hanger nailed in by three micro nails, all embedded in the wall with no way to get them out because they were hammered flush into the ""seamless"" hanger. I will keep putting ""seamless"" in quotation marks because there was nothing seamless about this project. So in trying to pull the broken ""seamless"" hanger out of our wall, we damaged the wall (of course). And I don't see much of a way that was to be avoided. We then tried again with the second ""seamless"" hanger, which held the picture for all of 32 second before smashing to the floor with the prized work of art in it. Thanks a lot. Just please for the love of the Lord put normal hanging hardware on this thing. Sometimes the wheel works just fine -- and what you reinvented in this instance is a supreme step down. I will go back to cleaning shards off my floor now.Apparently a 10"" x 14"" inch frame is difficult to come by. I went to Michael's, Joann's, and those are really my only two go-to frame places, but they didn't have one this size. This was a problem because I had a sweet piece of art I wanted to display but couldn't because of the slightly strange size. I took out the matting, and my poster fits perfectly. The frame itself feels rather cheap, and up close isn't perfect, but for how much trouble finding the right size is and at this price, this frame did what I needed it to do.Not A4 size. I have a few A4 prints and other frames. This frame did not fit any of my A4 prints. It�s a little too small and only works if you�re willing to cut your prints, which I am not. Also, I hadn�t realized it didn�t come with a bracket to mount on the wall, so it�s also only good if you wanted to rest this on a table or other surface. Who wants to rest such a large frame on a side table/coffee table? Returning.I recently purchased a piece of original colored sketch art. The artist resides in Finland, where the typical sheet of paper is A4-sized - 8.3 x 11.7 inches. The 8.3"" isn't too far off the 8.5"" for an American letter-sized sheet, but the 11.7"" length is problematic. This holder does the job nicely, and it's versatile in being able to either hang or rest on a surface. The one slight problem was it was hard to remove the protective backings off of the acrylic, so I had to carefully shallow-cut into it with a knife to get it to start. An extremely minor thing, though. Definitely a must for displaying A4-sized art.Pro's:","Pro's:

The light is comparable (even a little brighter based on the lumens rating, but not enough for me to tell visually). But at about 1/8 of the power draw, I can now add more lights to the existing circuits - with the halogen 1141's (and some MR16 floods, which I also replaced with LED bulbs) the transformers were at their load limit.I've only had them in for a few days so can't speak to longevity, but if 25,000 hours is accurate, then I shouldn't have to worry about replacing them for about 10 years - I was replacing the 1141's every 1-2 years before.I replaced 2 old style filament bulbs in my RV. These LED bulbs were brighter and consume less power than the filament style. I've only had them for less than a year so far but they seem to be great. Very easy to take the old bulb out and replace with the new one.While I can't opine on longevity just yet, these bulbs are a gem. I purchased them to replace a similar LED bulb in a dock light. Exact replacement of the existing bulb could only be purchased from a distributor of the light, and the lowest cost I could find for one bulb was $37 (yes, that's one bulb - the �list� price was $50 each!) with two-week availability. These bulbs were $4 each with two-day free shipping. Highly recommended as an excellent bulb with excellent value!They use less power and run much cooler than incandescent.I had 2 burned out porch lights on my motor home and used these as part of my LED relamping project. I am very pleased with the results. Bright enough for its purpose but not obnoxious at the camp ground. Will use these elsewhere as the need arises. Good value, too!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: ADAPTABLE TO YOUR POOL OR HOT TUB - Use 16 ounces per 10,000 gallons of pool water per week by adding the pool chlorine tablets to your floating chlorinator or a inline/offline chlorinator and using the flow of your pump to dissolve and distribute the pool chemicals. EASY TO USE - Each chlorinating tablet weighs 0.5 oz. Each bucket comes with multiple bagged tablets to help reduce the chemical mess. LONG LASTING - These Rx Clear chlorine tabs are slow dissolving, 90% available chlorine, 99% Trichlor. Note: Some of the tablets may be cracked or broken within their packaging due to shipping. This breakage is normal and does not reduce the effectiveness of these tabs. LOW PRICE, HIGH QUALITY - Compared to other brands, the Rx Clear brand provides more available chlorine in each tab at a much lower cost. TRUSTED POOL SUPPLIES - Rx Clear has high quality pool chemicals and pool accessories for a great value. Trust Rx Clear to balance your pool and spa chemistry and keep your water safe and cleari used a lot of different chlorine tablets before i found these. These are the best i have ever tried for a hot tub. Everything else seemed to dissolve too quick. These last forever and my water is crystal clear. If you have a hot tub you should definitely give them a try!We purchased these at the start of COVID outbreak to place into our toilet tanks. We also dissolved a tablet into a spray bottle to use as a cleaner. Works amazing. Better then Clorox or Lysol.Clorine levels have been higher and longer lasting since using this product.Used for a hot tub,at 100 deg f.I will definitely use again.These tablets were a great buy for the price. They lasted the entire pool season. Usually Walmart's runs out in the middle of summer and I am running around trying to find tablets. I will now order a bucket of these and be done. Very happy with theseThe only reason for this bad review is that these are advertised for pools and spas. They may work in pools but not in a spa. Being that I am a new and first time spa owner I didn't understand what it meant when it has ""Stabilizer"" in it. Now I do, this product should NEVER be used in spas because there is absolutely no reason to use a Stabilizer in a spa because they are covered and are not exposed to sun light all that much. The Cyanuric Acid levels went off the charts after using this product in my spa. I had to drain half the water out and refill to reduce those levels. Yes I was ignorant and didn't understand it but they should only advertise this product for pools only.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 100% Cotton. Drawstring closureI am 6�1 and have never, and I mean NEVER bought sweats that fit my length. I put these on and still had them bunch a bit at the bottom!!!!! If you�re tall you understand my excitement. Inexpensive cozy pants that actually cover my legs are great. Highly recommend.These sweatpants are the accurate length!! I�m 5�11� it�s nice to have casual lounge pants that fit. I ordered a 34� inseam/tall; love them. I got a large this time which is more appropriate to wear around the house. I�m 173lbs and prefer mediums when I�m running errands and such.Not cotton! The photo shows the inside tag, 90% polyester!! In the photo you can see the seahorse showing through showing the brand logo. Ladies, STOP giving positive reviews just because you like it, some people want cotton and this is the major selling point, so like them all you want but please let others know that the product is not as described. I�m printing my return label ASAP.I had ordered the black slim fit previously in large and although they fit, they were tighter than I wanted--closer to leggings--so I returned them in hopes of getting an xl but they were not in stock. So I ordered the light grey in loose fit L and they are perfect! I also ordered the dark grey, thinking they were slim fit, in XL. But when I got them and the receipt, it also said loose fit. So that part is a little confusing. They still fit great--slightly looser than the L. Both are 34"" Long--did shrink a bit in the dryer--I am 6' tall so they are at the bottom of my ankle. The material is thinner than I had anticipated, they are cotton--so no fuzzy stuff on the inside. More like a thick cotton t-shirt. Great for fall and since they are looser there is room for leggings underneath. But to be clear--I have super skinny legs. So if you are at all thicker in the thigh go for a bigger size if you want room, otherwise be prepared for a legging-type fit.I just received these sweatpants today. Let me tell you, if you are a very tall lady, you know the struggles of finding ANYTHING long enough: jeans, pants, sweats, jackets, whatever. I was skeptical to try these because the price was so good, but I took a chance, based on the reviews. So glad I did!!! For reference, I am 6'3"" (yes, it's true :) ) and I'm about 185-190 lbs. I wear a 36"" inseam, if the jeans are straight/bootcut or 34"" inseam if the legs are tapered or joggers. I ordered the large 34"" inseam, and all I can say is: THESE FIT GREAT!!!! You WON'T be able to find anything else like this on the web, especially at this amazing price! I've looked! Old Navy, Long Tall Sally, etc., it's IMPOSSIBLE!These arrived today, a whole week earlier than predicted, and as soon as I put them on, I KNEW! Tall ladies, you know that feeling when you try something on and it's just IT? That's the feeling I had! The waistband is comfy! Not too tight or too loose, and it has a drawstring to adjust. It's soooo long! They actually bunch up around my ankles a bit, which is soooooo rare for me! The pockets are deep and fit my iPhone 8 plus fine without it slipping out! I drop my phone a lot, so this is a plus for me! It also has a zippered pocked, on the left side, for a key or something small. And they're 100% cotton! Not only do I have to be unusually tall, I have very sensitive skin. I can't wear the tight leggings that are all spandex and nylon or my skin itches all day long. These are COTTON! How is that even possible??? They are so SOFT and feel AMAZING! I haven't tried washing them yet, but I'm going to wash them on cold and hang them to dry so they won't shrink (shrinkage: a tall lady's worst nightmare!).Anyway, if you read nothing else, read this: Don't hesitate to order them! You will NOT be sorry! I'm going to see if they have these in other colors. I ordered the gray, and I want some in black. If they don't, I will get on my knees and beg this company to make them in more colors, LOL! Now quit reading reviews and go order these! :DPro's:","Pro's:

I haven�t even properly hung them yet (they�re draped on the crown molding) and I�m in LOVE! I purchased the 108 linen. Make sure you select the correct color - I think this is why some people are disappointed. Also they�re obviously not room darkening lol. If you are looking for farmhouse, linen, light, and airy for a good value then these are it!! I actually had just purchased another brand for 40 dollars a panel!! YUCK!! I quickly cancelled for these because I was sick at the price of the others. I need 10 panels because I have 3 huge window bays in my dining/living/kitchen. So this was WAYYY better! I HIGHLY recommend these. I�ve been shopping for drapes for 6 months and the price and style cannot be beat! I�m in LOVE!!These curtains are way better than I was expecting for the price. They are lightweight and a perfect length for my 9� ceilings. I did end up using a seam ripper to make the rod pocket one large pocket. I purchased the natural color and it�s a lovely soft, off white neutral.The curtains are exactly what I was looking for! They are perfect and the price is amazing! I looked for months for quality curtains that didn�t cost a fortune! I almost spent nearly $600 on curtains that looked just like these from west elm! The curtains are light weight, but not sheer. They filter light perfectly! They are the perfect shade. Not super white, but not that nasty looking yellowish off white either. The color is very nice. The quality Is exceptional! I ordered 108�. I did not wash, iron or anything. I hung them right out of the package. The length on all of them were pretty even. I do think if I ironed them that would help. I added a pic to show what I mean, the edges seen to be a little uneven but it�s not super noticeable. I do not shut them because I have blinds. I would not recommend these if you are looking for privacy at night unless you add a lining to them. I used 2 sets of curtains on my windows for fullness. I absolutely recommend these curtains! The rod I used is called the Cappa curtain rod (brushed black) can be found at Bed bath and beyond or amazon. The color on my walls is �Alabaster� by Sherwin Williams. Hope this helps:)Absolutely perfect! Changing over my decor and these were perfect for the farmhouse look I am working on!I just hung these curtains and I am so pleased I had to write this review! If like me you are tired of a lace or polyester sheer curtain, these are a welcome change. The fabric has a nice drape, it is not flimsy or stiff. It is a linen/polyester blend that is semi-sheer - not room darkening and not complete privacy. I chose ivory and it is a off or antique white - not a bright white. These curtains are well tailored - both the same exact length and they are not stingy in width. I used the 50 by 84 on a 36"" window. As I like mine to puddle slightly I put the rod in the very top with no edging above. Another plus: Even though they are made in China, there is no chemical ordor. (I have had odor problems with items from China). They are nicely packaged in a plastic zippered bag. I cannot comment how they wash or wear as I just hung them. If they wear well I plan to buy another pair.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Comes with Regular Glass and a sawtooth hanger for wall mounting. Made of MDF - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it. For other colors and standard sizes in this frame style search 'WOMFRBW26079-4x6' on amazon.com. Fits 11x15 inch Photos, Actual Frame size (finished size) is 13x17 inches and the frame is 1.25 inches wide. This black satin frame is our favorite gallery frame. This is our most versatile frame, photographs posters prints diploma's and certificates look amazing in this smooth and sophisticated frameAlmost really nice...So they package this as if it's glass. So the packaging is great! My poster looks much more prominent in this. The frame has no nicks or dings.However... I think they intended to cover both sides with a thin removable sheet of plastic to protect it from scratches. Mine had the back side only half covered and there's a few visible marks. And what really sucked is they stuck an awful to remove sticker on the front that says ""both sides peel off!"" except... Their was no plastic on the front. So they stuck the sticker right to the acrylic. In my attempt to remove all of the sticker, their is now a big ugly dull/faded area on the acrylic.This product is nice. Just make sure they package it right. And careful on their stupid sticker if you run into my situation.I needed a frame to display my new ""Temple of the Dog"" show poster (12X36) but didn't want to spend crazy money on it. After reading both positive and negative reviews for this frame I decided to roll the dice and grab one based solely on cost.... I'm so glad I did; the frame I received is fantastic for what I spent! Once you take the protective film off the plexi glass (both sides as displayed on the product) it's super clear. My package also included mounting hardware including a wall hook. The only thing that I can see to complain about is the frame backing which is cardboard but who cares??? The cardboard had no issues holding my concert poster in place and I'm the only one that will ever see the back. I'll be ordering more to complete our ""Wall of Concert Flyers""Really excited to get this but disappointed when I found that it doesnt actually fit a 19x23 picture... at first I thought I had mis-measured but measuring the inside it is actually for a 18x22 print (see pictures). So annoyed that I now have to repack and return such a large item. I measured multiple times and read the description (which says it would fit pictures 19x23) to avoid this.This frame was purchased to fit an inexpensive, oddly-sized print, and I was happy to find that such an unusual size was available for purchase without having to resort to a customized framing order. The product shipped quickly, and it was easy to assemble. It also looks fine on the wall. The problem, however, is the price. The product is very flimsily made, and for the price, the quality should be better. The seller either needs to improve the quality to match the price or reduce the price to match the quality. I've purchased better frames for lower prices at art stores, though, of course, it often is difficult to find nonstandard sizes.I don�t usually write amazon reviews as I typically agree with what�s been previously posted. Before I bought this I saw a lot of mixed reviews and was hesitant to purchase because of some of the negativity being brought on by others. Yes the clear solid that comes with it that allows you to view your framed object is Plexiglas. This is sort of funny because the box it ships in is glass. Yes it just has a cardboard back with those little metal bendy things to hold it in pace. And yes the frame itself is made out of some compressed particle board material. For my purposes though it worked great. I got what is pretty much a custom sized frame shipped to me in a few days through prime. There was a myriad of size choices and color choices. The packaging was great and the frame came out unscathed. It even came with a hanging kit although I did have to use a drill to attach the hooks to the frame itself. The Plexiglas is a little extra reflective but as other users have pointed out making your own custom cut glass isn't that hard if you really need it. For me though this worked. The object I am displaying is more than nice looking in this frame and that�s all I needed for it (the ability to put it on the wall and call attention to it). The cardboard functions well and I didn't pay an arm and a leg for a custom frame job at a crafts store with a 'museum quality' frame, not to mention the quick shipping time. Last I checked they were $100+ with a coupon. So if you�re hanging some great family heirloom or something you might want to go to the crafts store but if you�re hanging that finger painting you�re 5 year old did in art class these are perfect.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Brand New Black Wood 12x17 Picture Frame with Mat. Fit For: One 12x17-inch Photo (without Mat) or 8x10 (1) and 5x7 (2) Pictures (with Mat). Includes: One 12x17 Black Colored Wood Frame with White Mat. Features: Real Wood Molding, Bevel Cut Mat, Real Glass, Swivel Tabs, Saw Tooth Hanger for Wall Mounting, Collage Frame. Suitable for any home or office d�cor! The look of this wooden frame is sure to brighten up any room. It is a great way to show off a collection of photos and pictures for your family, friends, and guests.Perfect size!I was so disappointed to receive this 12 x 24"" frame today with a chipped corner! It probably happened during shipping as it was not securely packaged. When I first opened the box, there was only a thin piece of styrofoam resting on one corner (not taped to the corner!) which broke as soon as I removed it. There were other styrofoam pieces at the other end of the box. The frame itself seems pretty sturdy and probably would have worked well for my odd-sized print if it hadn't been damaged. Hope I can return this.Nice product. I purchased it for the specific matte sizes.My only complaint is that the sample picture sheet, AKA ""cheat-sheet"", that comes in the frame doesn't precisely fit the matte cut-outs. When using this type of frame & matte, I use two-sided photo tape to attach my photos over the sample pictures on the cheat-sheet, and usually that puts my pictures exactly where they need to be to fit the matte cut-outs. Unfortunately the sample pictures are over-sized, so I had to move pictures around a bit to find the proper placement in the cut-outs. It's a silly complaint, but yes, it's a bummer when the cheat-sheet gives you the wrong answers and you actually have to do the work yourself! :) Otherwise, nice product.What a solid and sturdy frame! This thing was heavier than expected and is quite sturdy! It came well packaged and secure in the box with corner guards. The divider popped out for use as a full frame easily and the glass was cut well and clean. It was a vast improvement over the previous frame I used and will look fantastic in my home for ears to come!The frames are just a little smaller than my actual pictures, so the edges do get cut off, but I love the layout. It's sturdy and well made.Pro's:","Pro's:

Really easy to carry and transport for your family party and friends gathering.Pretty good canopy for the price (paid about 169 when purchased, 5-19), easy to unpack and figure out, reasonable ""clicking mechanisms"" for height and locking in place. Not going to be the most durable of the offerings out there, as I have owned and destroyed over 20 of these things - I find that the ""decent"" ones live as long as the ""good"" ones when doing what we do with them (events every weekend) - the good ones are for folks who need sturdy and don't have them up and down all the time. - This - is the one for everybody else - it's pretty darn good. (Fabric is a little light, we'll see how long it lasts)Product is well worth the money. I did purchase 6 weights for the legs as I have it on my patio and being that it can be very very windy, I lower the legs all the way down and recently was extremely wind and I just removed the top. Again, need 4 people to pull apart and once that is complete, TENT IS WORTH THE MONEY.Bought this to aid in our business outside worked great until it rained. Found out had several small holes. But never fear gorilla tape to the rescue. Overall love this product. Size is amazing. Maybe think about extending up just a little more.I put it up myself. Don�t do that. Trust me. I love it though. Covers up my patio and furniture. First night it was up we had a huge rain storm. Not a drop got thru my furniture stayed dry and so did my chickens that hung out under aciujch. Could be used for any number if things.I am a 63 year old experienced hostess who had to move the party outside when COVID hit and then drug on and on.

Text: A Revolutionized Training Glove: You need a glove that checks all of the boxes, from protection and comfort to durability and fit. T3 Boxing Gloves do just that, with a decade of sports science & research to back it up. This modern training glove offers world-renowned protection with patented technology of a new era.. Built For Comfort With A Tailored Fit: Interior fabric feels smooth and cool on your hands and helps to regulate your hand temperature. Two interlocking velcro wrist straps adjust to fit your hands perfectly for Boxing, Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), Kickboxing, and Muay Thai.. World Renowned Wrist Support: The dual wrist straps and splinting system work together to keep your wrists aligned with each punch. It locks your wrists in place when you strap up, preventing risky and damaging bends.. Ultimate Knuckle Protection: Premium foam technology absorbs impacts, dispersing energy for unparalleled knuckle protection during training.. Recommended Use: 10oz -12oz for bags/pads | 14oz, 16oz and 18oz for bags/pads, partner drills, and sparringI've been boxing for about six months now, starting from group classes and now taking one on one training and also doing Muay Thai. I started with cheap $30 Everlast 12 oz gloves and they were fine for starting out, but as my training frequency has increased, I decided I needed a more sturdy pair of gloves with better wrist protection.While working with my instructor, I sprained my wrist and could not follow through with my punches. After trying out my trainer's higher end gloves, I realized how much more protection and stability better gloves offered. So I did my research and decided on the Hayabusa 16 oz T3s and absolutely love them! Gloves are made to protect your hands not your opponent. I am 5'9"" and 193 lbs and opted for the 16 oz gloves which provides a great fit and training to strengthen my endurance during heavy bag workouts while providing good protection for the hand and the wrist. For speed workout, I actually use my MMA gloves on the bag.The thumb area is lined with sweat absorbing material which is convenient to wipe away the sweat in between training as well. The only downside is the double velcro closure if there is no one around to help you secure the glove, but you'll get used to it. Besides, the double velcro closure provides a secure clasp to protect your wrist and I prefer the stability of the clasp over the inconvenience of strapping the velcros.I�ve been trying to find the perfect glove for months for kickboxing. They were either too soft, too rigid, cuff length too long, you name it. I decided to spend the extra money on these as nothing else had worked out. For starters it�s a beautifully designed glove. It just looks amazing. The double wrist strap provides great support and it�s very comfortable to wear. They feel broken in already. Nice and firm over the knuckles, but also able to open and close my fist. The microfiber thumb for wiping sweat is the icing on the cake. I�m super happy with my purchase and will never go with another glove again.My first product review. I think understanding the reviewer adds value to the review. I have been training almost 6 years and started with an off the shelf 30$ pair of gloves. Typical gonna give this a try glove. My gym is a hybred, more than a fitness club but not a hard core fighters gym. Perfect for some hard bag workout with some light sparring sprinkled in. Gradually stepped up my glove, wore out a pair of Titles. I recently upped my training To 4 days and the Ringside pair I had was nice but just did not offer the wrist support I needed, plus they ran small and I had a hard time getting wraps in.Spent a little more money on this pair 16 oz. 1 week in..... I could definitely feel a quality upgrade from what I had. The wrist support was very good. My hands have enough room for wraps, but do not feel like I ""have"" to have them. Double Velcro was not overly hard to figure out. I see little difference in the ""Engineered"" leather.That was a concern. You can easily get a pair of leather gloves for that much money. I was hesitant to buy a pair without trying them on. The price was a little on the high side of the spectrum for me, but so far worth it. I don't have to pull some punches for fear of sore wrist, makes training a bit more fun. This glove is as advertised.These are the best gloves that I've personally used or owned. I use them for sparring and for bag work. I bought the 16oz. They feel totally secure and safe. My wrist, knuckles, and hands feel SUPER protected. You can hit really hard with these with minimal impact to your fists or wrists. The splints make it practically impossible for your wrists to bend, especially in addition to your hand wraps, and the double straps allow you to tighten it to your desired level. These things are awesome, really. The black and gold looks super bad@ass too. I would recommend these for advanced level and beginner level as well. Beginners don't have their technique and fundamentals down yet, so these would protect them and allow them to train and learn safely. If they're going to take it seriously, you might as well get gloves that are legit, instead of messing around with flimsy cheaper beginner gloves that allow the possibility of injury. For advanced trainers, these gloves have all the comfort and safety functions needed to train as hard as you want, whether it be sparring or hours of bag work. The thumbs allow you to wipe sweat also, which I've quickly realized is a huge underestimated added bonus. They are well worth the price. You can tell that as soon as you open them. Only one little minor ""gripe"", or ""suggestion"", is that I wish they came with their own carry bag, so I didn't have to just throw them in my training bag with everything else, but I will purchase one. The quality of these is top notch, but whenever they do wear out I'll be buying another pair for sure.Thought they were going to be too small when i first put them on. I almost returned them before even trying them. I am so glad i didn't. These gloves are amazing. I bought these to replace a pair of RDX Elites i bought 9 months ago that were beginning to come apart.This is a compact glove, which means dense foam so you can tell which knuckles are striking the bag/your opponent.It is possible to fasten the wrist incredibly tight, Like truncate levels of tightness , so don't do that. If you do that its your fault not the gloves fault. (I did that and blamed the gloves at first).Tip - use the velcro straps to fasten them around a tower fan to air them out after your work out.Pro's:","Pro's: 
- World renowned wrist support

Lightweight and stylish design suits men ,women,student,or college to use at business trip, travel, work, school and more occasions.This spacious 15-15.6 inch laptop bag is well-built, and the main compartment easily fits my OMEN HP 15 Gaming Laptop. FYI, my laptop dimensions are: 14.17 x 10.35 x 1.02in (W x D x H). Additionally, it has enough room to comfortably fit the following gear:1). A fairly large A/C power adapter;2). A full-sized corded Logitech G500s gaming mouse;3). A USB-C cable that's more than 6 feet long;4). The included shoulder strap that came with this sleeve;I was then able to easily fit the loaded laptop bag into a regular size JanSport school backpack. I can probably fit my cell phone in it and a few other small items as well.The build quality material on the Voova Laptop Bag is excellent and appears to be durable and tough enough to last for many years to come. In my opinion, this bag is sufficiently padded to withstand and protect my laptop from accidental drops and falls.With the added feature of converting to a shoulder carry bag, this sleeve is a very good value for the price. This laptop bag has all of the features and functionality that I was looking for, and I heartily recommend it.This case is sewn well and made from acceptable quality material, but unfortunately it does not afford great protection. There is ample padding for the two large flat computer sides, but little to no padding for the edges and corners. There is also no material built in to prevent the zipper from scratching the computer (though a neoprene sleeve would help in this regard). There is insufficient room to tuck a piece of 1/4"" foam (that is dense enough to afford protection) in the pocket formed by the outer zipper which makes the bag expandable.The case is a good value if all you need is a carry bag that does not offer better protection, or an expandable bag is a priority, but it falls a little short where protection is concerned.The VOOVA LINE of Laptop, Bag/Soft Case/Briefcases, However you want to name them, In ALL SIZES!, IF YOU VALUE YOUR LAPTOP, THERE IS NO OTHER LINE!, THAT CAN MATCH THIS ONE---HANDS DOWN!!.

It was reasonably priced and came in a lovely shade of plum. So far, I have only good things to say about it; however, if I had one thing to �improve,� I would probably recommend the designer add a bit more padding around the area that a laptop goes. I am moderately careful how I treat my computers and so I�m not overly worried about it traveling in this bag, but life happens and a little more padding would go a long way.

Looks very pretty, but extremely light weight. I figured it must be hollow. I took it to my local jewelers to have the end worked on to fit the bale of a newly purchased diamond pendant. The jeweler would not work on it, because it is hollow. He stated that I should not wear any pendant on a hollow chain, because it will wear very quickly. I don't think the cost justifies a hollow chain. I am returning the chain and going to purchase something that better fits my needs.Buyers, please beware and avoid being disappointed or frustrated. I purchased the thirty-inch version of this chain. It broke the third time I wore it. I am a careful kind of person and DID NOT yank the chain or apply inappropriate force or weight to the chain.

The installation pieces that come with the frames are super helpful too!I ordered these frames because wing made of solid wood they seemed like a good value given the price. Well, they are made of wood alright, so the manufacturer isn�t lying about that. How solid they are is another question. The wood used to make these frames is like a half a step above balsa wood. As I unpacked them I felt I had to treat them with kid gloves or they�d fall apart right there in my hands. The manufacturer literally sends each frame (I purchased a three-pack) with a small plastic item to repair corners that have come apart. You can scratch through the paint and hit raw wood with a fingernail. One of my three frames actually came scratched right from the manufacturer. I opted to touch it up myself rather than go through the hassle of a return and subsequent wait for a replacement. Opening the frames to insert my artwork was fairly straight forward. Everything fit as it was supposed to. I managed to get all three up on the wall without damaging them, and they do look nice, but I doubt I�ll order these again. I think I�ll opt for something more sturdily put together.Glad I got the white frames. Really makes these colorful posters pop!UPDATE: The seller reached out, apologized and insisted on giving me a refund. While it was not necessary as I still did use the product, it was very professional and appreciated -- I was assured future products would be triple checked (which was really the only outcome I needed).

A slim, lightweight, durable golf bag for easy carrying plus 4 head covers to keep the clubs protected on the go.. GOLF ON YOUR TERMS. Adult golf clubs designed with thoughtful touches to make your game a breeze. A bigger sweet spot means straighter, cleaner hits for players at all levels and a soft grip helps you play through rounds in comfort.. NOT YOUR AVERAGE CLUBS. Built to the same standards of top-tier brands, Robin Golf clubs strike the perfect balance between performance and usability. Enhance your golf experience and have fun with these easy-to-use golf clubs.. SLEEK DESIGN. These clubs are simple, sleek, and beautiful. Designed with a matte black finish from top to bottom, this set will make you the most stylish golfer on the course.. DRIVER. Once you get a taste of the sweet spot, there�s no turning back. A titanium driver, designed with the perfect level of forgiveness and power, so you can really smoke it.. FAIRWAY WOOD. A graphite wood, as sleek as it is forgiving. Play the long game you were meant to off a tee or blade of grass.. HYBRID. Bring in the steel reinforcements. Our graphite shaft and stainless-steel hybrid delivers the utility, versatility, and oomph to get you out of the tricky spots throughout the entire course.I've been golfing my entire life and have had a number of top of the line sets of clubs over the years (TaylorMade, Callaway, etc.). When a buddy recommended I check out Robin I was incredulous about how a new brand would hold up to my sets from much more established companies. Turns out: they hold up quite well!From the get-go their sleek black design made them stand out without being too flashy - I got 3 compliments (from folks of all ages) on the first day I took them to the range! Their construction was sturdy yet comfortable. Best of all, they seem to be much more forgiving than my old set, with a larger sweet spot that has me nailing drives on a much more regular basis. From the design to the construction and the improvement in my game, these are a no-brainer for me.I got these clubs for my boyfriend (now fianc�) and he is literally obsessed. I bought the kids clubs for my niece and she liked them so much I looked at the men's clubs since my fianc� wanted to pick golf back up again during covid and I am so glad I did! The reviews were all amazing and the price point is hard to beat.Since I gave them to him as a birthday present, he's been golfing multiple times a week and raving about the clubs. He said ""the weight is excellent, I've improved my game significantly since I started using these! The grip is also way better than my old Mizuno's and way more modern and sleek looking as well""Warning: if you buy these for a significant other, you should either pick up golf yourself or be prepared to see them a lot less. My fianc� has been using the clubs nonstop!So I am getting into golf due to COVID. It's the only thing I can still do with the homies that is moderately COVID safe. After months of this set tantalizing me via targeted IG ads I pulled the trigger. Very VERY happy with my purchase. 10/10 recommendThe clubs look great. They're sleek and subtle. But, they don't compromise on quality. They feel and perform on par with brands that cost 2x or more (Taylor Made, Callaway, etc.). Highly recommend!I have owned clubs for years but during Covid shutdown I started playing a lot more. Before probably 4-5 times a year. Since Covid more like 5 times a month, during last spring/summer more like 8 times per month. I had a set of Pings I picked up at a consignment. I got better but still didn't feel good about consistency. Read up on Robin clubs and decided to give them a shot. I absolutely love the irons. They feel good and after a couple of times out have improved my GIR %. A lot less scrambling. The hybrid, 3W and D feel nice as well and I did not see a loss on distance with the driver. I am glad I went this route instead of buying a more expensive full set. I'll think about that when I break 90.Pro's:","Pro's:

Support recovery post workout with ingredients like tart cherry, turmeric extract and 2 billion CFU probiotics (bacillus coagulans) to help build muscle and support recovery..

Keto-friendly protein powder for women and men with 4 gram net carbs, and no artificial sweeteners, flavors or colors, lactose and dairy free, soy free and non whey. Not a medical food. Smooth taste and texture, just blend or shake with water or your choice of beverage post workout � or even add some fruit to make a tasty protein packed smoothieI like this stuff and go through a lot. So I wish there was an option to have it shipped in a bag rather than this heavy duty plastic tub. I hate wasting all this plastic. Customers and Amazon should pressure manufacturers to provide lower waste options.This is pretty good. It mixes very well. Taste good.However, it contains stevia and xantham gum. I have SIBO and am fairly sensitive to additives. Not sure if it's these or some other, but I found a different Pea Protein-based protein supplement that works better for me and is cheaper: Almost Naked Pea Protein, Vanilla flavor.The main difference in terms of texture is that the Vega will taste smoother and stay mixed longer. The Naked Pea will separate within minutes, which is fine. I can just shake the bottle the mix is in or just swirl a fork in my drink to get it to mix again.What I'll occasionally do to get the smooth taste of the Naked Pea is mix a small serving of the Vega and tada... It's all smooth now.All in all, I don't need the Vega, but I understand those who make a point in having as delicious tasting a shake as possible. For me, I'm optimizing for the right amount of protein within a budget I set - Pea Protein is the cheapest and most consistent way to get my proteins on a daily basis without eating an inordinate amount of meat or wrecking my gut (Whey and Casein will do that - if you're having lots of gas it's because you're not digesting these properly).I decided to switch to plant based protein after I watched a documentary on youtube. This protein is pretty expensive, so i figured it must me high quality. It mixes well enough, although if you let it sit for a minute or two it will thicken up and rise to the top of your shaker cup.1 scoop of protein, once a day, resulted in many trips to the can. I had to crap throughout the day and night. Not massive poo's but annoying half solid poo's. My rear end was tender after the multiple wiping throughout the day.I discontinued use early due to the poo's. The unused tub of protein sits in the pantry, waiting for the day when I consume too much cheese.For the past few years I've been trying different Whey Protein Powders.... until I realized I'm Lactose Intolerant. This discovery made me search out for a new Protein Powder.I've tried 2-5 brands of Vegan Protein Powders.... by the end of it I was beyond disappointed and felt like I would never find the ""perfect"" one. Until I stumbled upon this baby. Besides it having a FANTASTIC TASTE, it is an amazing Protein Powder to use as a recovery. My body not only recovers 2x as fast but my stomach is no longer bloated(due to trying several types and being allergic to them).If you happen to have a sensitive stomach or just want to make sure you have THE BEST ingredients in your body, LOOK NO FURTHER. This product is amazing!Back in 2017 I was vegan for about a year when I first tried Vega sport and I immediately fell in love with it! Before using Vega I tried CARNIVORE, Optimum Nutrition, Isopure, and many other protein brands. I ultimately stuck with ON which I always thought was a quality protein (which it is). I have always been pretty sensitive to lactose or any milk derivatives so any whey isolate (optimum nutritions protein) would always give me the bubble guts (bloating, upset stomach, gastro problems). Once I finally tried Vega all of those issues stopped. I�ve Never had an upset stomach, the bloating went away, and the dreaded �protein farts� magically went away. On top of the way Vega made my body feel, the protein also has great taste and easily mixes. The calories to protein/carb ratio is phenomenal as well! One thing I will point out is that the scoops are fairly large (44g compared to the standard 30g). Overall I would recommend this protein to anyone.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: A HEALTHIER HOUSEHOLD - Breathe easy in your home with a Honeywell Home 4-Inch High Efficiency Air Cleaner Filter that helps keep hazardous airborne particles out and fresh air flowing in. MERV 8 RATING - Get exceptional protection against dust, viruses, bacteria, fungus, pollen, and spores. 20x more effective than typical 1-inch fiberglass filters. RECOMMENDED USE - Recommended for homes with pets, people with allergies, homes with smokers, or anyone wanting cleaner air. LONG LASTING FILTRATION - Lasts up to 12 months without losing quality over time. EASY INSTALLATION - Honeywell Home's easy-to-install air filters make changing out your air filtration unit quick, painless, and mess-free. Actual Dimensions: 19.94 x 24.87 x 4.38 in.After using higher Merv rating filters over the last couple of years, my system sometimes struggled to keep things cool/warm depending on the season. It would run constantly on hot or cold days because it just wasn't moving as much air due to the more restrictive nature of the Merv 12, which became even more restrictive with use. So while it may have filtered out more particles we were paying for it both in the wallet and comfort.Switched to a Merv 8 and my system just seems to breath better and recovery when the t-stat is turned down or up is faster, that and it's not running all of the time now!Important note that I ignored for a long time- the tighter weave of your filter the hard it is to push air through so your furnace might not operate at its best. I bought this lower merv rating - still an 8!- and my furnace runs smoother and so far the efficiency is noticed in the fact that it�s not running all the time. I don�t have dust either so my guess is while I would love to capture pollens and micron sized stuff , if my furnace runs better I�m getting better air all around. I bought stand alone filter machines to get the tiny stuff in my rooms.Really Amazon.... You packed a filter with gallon of liquid?I'm recommending customers place this order separate so it doesn't get stuck in a box with heavy items. I'm Crushed??-I have purchased this brand of filter before, performance and quality were as expected - I have never had issues. i'm sure being crushed doesn't help performance, but that's not a reflection of the product quality.I haven't used mine yet, but I did a trial fit in my filter drawer and it fit well in my 20x25x5 furnace filter drawer, as the actual filter dimensions on this filter are just a fraction under the 20"" and 24"" dimensions, while the 4"" dimension is actually 4 3/8"".The filter my installer put in the furnace was also listed as 20x25x4, but was only 3.5"" deep. I had measured the furnace filter drawer before ordering this one and I'm pleased with the fit and quality of the filter.Normally I have the 1"" thick filters in the external slots with nothing in the actual air plenum slot. That worked ok for large pet hair, dust, stuff like that. But when my wife's daughter came with cat allergies... we pulled the other filters out and installed this in the main slot instead. I almost want to say it's like putting an N95 mask on your house... this filter works. Without it she would get red eyes and such... with it... she was here for a week without issues.Pro's:","Pro's:

Quickly capture high-quality images and extended lengths of Full-HD and 4K UHD. Load apps quicker with blazing A2 speed. Designed for durability in harsh conditions. Limited lifetime product support for card and 1-year for adapterThis Lexar Professional 1066x 64GB microSD card is a great card. It's fast, with the write speed very close to the advertised rate of 70 MB/sec. This card is made in Taiwan, and not the PRC, which is great for me because I like to support democracy. Capacity is the only issue I found with this card. I have a previous Samsung Pro 64GB card that formats to 59.5GB (showing in Windows 10) using Fat32. This card formats to 58.9 GB using Fat32. That's over 600 MB less capacity with the Lexar card. That said, I still recommend this card, just beware of the slight reduction in space compared to other brands, so I give it four stars.I also purchased the Lexar microSD 128GB card (can only write one review, so here is my 128GB review):The 128 GB card has a fast write speed, but it's only just over 70MB/sec, with the package showing 120MB/sec. It may be my USB3 card reader or my USB chipset, but I have read benchmarks faster than 125 MB/sec with several full size SD cards. That said, the size of the 128 GB card is less than my Sandisk 128GB micro card as well, showing 117 GB vs 118GB with the Sandisk (both formatted Fat32). So this 128 GB Lexar MicroSD card is slow, but it still is plenty fast for 4K recording, which is what I use it for. I'll keep a four star rating, knowing it's not close to perfect, but it's good enough. I also like that the card shows Made in Taiwan, which is a big plus over my other microSD cards not made in democratic countries.Bought this to format as internal storage for my new Android 10 tablet.Tablet recognized it, formatted it, and has been using it without incident since.The storage capacity is sufficient for my needs (256 GB is plenty) and the speed ratings on the card ensure it doesn't slow down the tablet.Can't ask much more of it than that. Since it's brand new - I can't speak to longevity, but as a well-respected brand, I'd expect it to last.I love the storage capacity! This card works perfectly for my needs. Lexar makes some of the best SD cards on the market. I�ve always had a good experience with them.have been using it in hwawei mate 9 for almost a year. not a problem. choice this most importantly because of transfer rate and xray tolerant as i go through air port check points alotpurchased after reading countless reviews for my insta 360 cam. works great so farPro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanThis is NOT a paperback. Rather, it's a comic. Very big difference!All in all, this was a pretty good read. The art seems to change halfway through the book, so it's kinda hard to tell who's who. Also, I wanted the cover with the nurse on it and got a different one, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. Besides one petty complaint, that's about all. Besides that, it was pretty good. NOTE: these events seem to take place after the Dead Space books, so you might want to pick those up first.interesting with a snicker.

Handy space of storage, easier to carry and use.. Sport type: Camping_hikingnanI have used this for two separate week long trips. It has stormed 3-4 times during that time and I haven't seen any leaks. The ventilation in this tent is way better than any previous ones I've experienced. The only things I don't like are that there are only legs and guy lines to open up one side of the rain fly as an awning and if the rain fly doors are open there are no internal flaps to close windows for privacy. The mattresses shown are twin sized. Very roomy.Liked the spaciousness. Disliked the quality of the rainfly. My son tripped on one of the tethers and the rainfly tore substantially. Feel like it shouldn't have considering the size of my son and the way he tripped. Also, the rainfly does NOT attach to the tent. Instead it sits on top and is tethered to the ground. When we camped this wasn't an issue. However, I think this will make it nearly impossible to set up if there is any wind or breeze.Tent poles came apart, caused the tent to rip once fully assembled. Piece of crap and I can�t return it either. Zero starsWe used the product for our family of 5 to go camping. The kids also like to use it outside as a place to play and get shade from the sun. It is nice because you can have it as one big room.Pro's:","Pro's:

EASY CARE: Machine washable in cold water, use only non-chlorine bleach when needed, tumble dry low and warm iron as neededThis is the second set of curtains I have purchased. I bought a set 3 years ago and they are amazing high quality curtains. They look very elegant, hotel quality. They are heavy weight curtains with a black out lining. Even the lining is a soft but heavy weight material. I did purchase another set of grey curtains for my room but they just didn�t have the look of a high quality curtain. The weight of the fabric and woven pattern of these curtains makes them look expensive. See pics and decide for yourself. They were a little long for my space so I just bought some hem tape here on Amazon and ironed the curtains to the perfect length.I love these curtains!! We have a bright aqua marine accent wall in our entertainment room that I wanted to compliment with a duller Teal in curtains. I didn�t want anything too bright, plus I needed something very long to go from the ceiling to the floor. (96-102�) These curtains were perfect!!! Love Them!! We have walls full windows next to a sliding door that lets WAY too much sun and heat in (we are in Phx AZ).And it�s in our tv room where we have our larger television. The windows and sunlight even with the blinds, creates a mirror image on the television all day, and heats up the downstairs. These curtains were a great solution!It darkens our living room and kitchen so much that my husband can take naps now on our couch In there and it cools down much faster...( no thanks to our air conditioner). But these curtains have a thick and heavy blackout effect that is more than satisfying! I did need to iron them when I took them out of the bag. You can tell from my pictures, there is one set of curtains I did not iron. But I wanted them up fast! Also, the Last time I checked, you�re not using curtains to sleep on, so �softness� shouldn�t matter. they are somewhat textured and rough to the touch but no more Than a standard table cloth or upholstered chair. If I could afford it, I would put these through the entire downstairs, and The long hallway in my upstairs that has just as many windows facing that same direction without a patio to cover them.If this company ever clearances these curtains I want them all !!Wanted to love these, they are thick and offer a great selection of sizes that can fit any window, I purchased two white panels. I washed them upon delivery (listed in the description that they are machine washable) and my white curtains came out with brown stains all over, because of the bronze grommets. Used stain remover, washed again, and still didn't come out. Hoping they fulfill their ""8 year quality guarantee"" and send me replacements. The curtains are great, just don't wash them if you get white or a light color.I ordered two panels for my bedroom.... love them!! However; the long panel for my slider has stripes in it and the stripes are crooked - I know it's part of the backing, or part of the inside of the drape, but when the sun shines through it, it looks ridiculous.... it's only from about half the drape up, but there's a broad band and then smaller bands all the way up and they aren't even straight! They sag! I am extremely disappointed. Maybe I'll re-order in a darker color??? I love the material and everything else about the drape, but I can't forgive the stripes.I wish I had more windows so I had a reason to buy more of these curtains!It took me a while to finally pick a curtain because they are all so gorgeous, but I finally settled on charcoal. I was looking for some long panels to visually open up the tall frameless window in the bedroom while also blocking light. Our linens/decor is largely in a grey palette, but kind of all over the place as far as tones and hues, some very greenish, some warm, some steely blue. To make matters worse, our furniture is a mishmash of mid-century walnut originals and contemporary laminated particleboard in black, brown and black-brown. So I was really hoping maybe some curtains would coordinate it all. I checked out the charcoal, taupe and grey and was completely unprepared for how terrific they all were. These panels are nice and weighty, but not heavy enough to make my widespread curtain rods droop. (I thought I might have to install a ceiling support, phew!). Although the product photos show the texture of the knit up close, the photos don't do them justice. You really have to see them in a room. There's a slight shimmer to the knit which doesn't at all show up as shiny or metallic, but subtly reflects so many complimentary tones in all different lighting. (You could probably purchase any shade of these H. Versailtex curtains for literally any color decor, and it would miraculously tie the room together.) Also, I never heard of this company before stumbling upon them on here, amazon for the win!PROS:- Definitely ""room darkening"" and not blackout, which I prefer. We tried blackout curtains and thought they were great until we woke up at 3:30pm and very confused. These block out enough light to sleep in comfortably, but not like an isolation tank.- Pretty, smooth, brown grommets. Antique bronze or whatever, I worried they would clash with my pewter rods, but just like the curtains themselves, they compliment the decor. I also appreciate the clean line- they're not stamped with weird embellishments and so there's no drag and it pulls smoothly without whatever you call that circular maneuver is when you're wrestling a drape that got stuck. (The ability to open and close efficiently is something I look for in a window treatment.)- Quality, straightforward packaging. Vinyl and a zipper go a long way. Nothing screams disappointment like new fancy drapes packaged like something someone forgot to pick up at the dry cleaners.CONS:- Compelled me to write a lengthy review about curtains, which I've never done before and am unsure how I feel about that.I am just a regular amazon shopper who paid full price and would do so again. I just happen to think these are terrific and deserve a strong recommendation:)Pro's:","Pro's:

Please note: frame without stand, just for wall.. Plastic acrylic front preserves and protects your picture. Make sure to peel off the protective film on both side of the plastic acrylic.. If our products have any quality issue, please contact us for replacement or refund, Your satisfaction is always the first. The Print showing on the picture for reference only.It arrive packaged well with no damage. The frame has very little flex when twisted and appears to be made really well. It IS mass produced so it's not going to be the quality of a custom made frame. Although not expensive art quality, it is great for a photograph. The frame corners were mitered well with no gaps or overhangs. The frame coloring was even and had no blemishes. The backing retaining clips fit into the frame slots well with none loose. The acrylic sheet, like all acrylic sheets, will scratch easily so handle it very carefully. Both sides of the acrylic has protective film to remove. I'm not a big fan of the hangers on the backing plate, mine are holding fine but they do look as if they might come off if pulled. I would have like to see a small rivet holding them on. Since it does not have a glass pane, it's very light and probably won't break the hangers. If you are concerned, you could easily modify the hangers prior to hanging. I'll modify mine if it comes loose, but as light as it is, I doubt it will. I'm pretty happy overall. I was expecting a very poorly made frame but it's actually made pretty well for an inexpensive frame.Bought this to put a diamond painting in that I did. Really looks nice.We were surprised at the quality of the product as it's far nicer than we expected. It will be used to frame a document that will be auctioned off for charity and the frame represents well.I haven�t got the chance to placed this on my wall yet but it�s super cute and fancy I like it!

My only disappointment was that the hand cage was very large. If you are a woman and have a large hand, these might be fine. I bought the 16oz for heavy bag work and it looks like I have giant blow up costume mitts on. Unfortunately returning.I ordered the 16oz gloves but wow, they were extremely small. I normally use 14oz or 16oz gloves so as soon as I put these on, I knew something was off. I checked these out on the scale, they were 12oz gloves, not 16oz.Just be aware that's what you'd end up getting.Do not buy. I used for a couple of months and this is what they ended up looking like after use. They fit good and feel nice but do not last.Well made! Quality material. Great for starter gloves. The 6oz gloves fit a little big on my 4 year old but he loves them and they protect his little hands. You get more than what you pay for.These gloves were cheap, I can't complain too much. I returned them the day I got them and did not use them at all. I took them out the bag and they were very nice looking gloves. I took one and bent it by the wrist--the wrist completely folded. I put one glove on and I could very easily fold my wrist towards my forearm. I did not have on wraps. I have use lots of other gloves without wraps and my wrist felt supported. My main reason for returning these gloves is that there isn't enough wrist support.Pro's:","Pro's:

We have 4 kids and two adults and sometimes other family pops in for the camping trip. Always more the merrier. But out tent never seems quite big enough. Until now we finally decided to go ahead and get the 12 person tent and camp comfortably! It also is quick and easy setup, who could ask for more. With three people helping get this tent set up it took us 10 minutes ! With a tent this large you definitely have at least three that should help with set up. This tent is waterproof, and wind proof holding steady and secure to the ground. The frame is made sturdy and is so spacious! Their are lots of pockets to hold things like cell phones tablets and keys. Also a place to hang a light or small fan at the too with a built in hook! We can place 3 queen air mattresses in here easily , or up to 12 sleeping bags.This is the biggest tent we have ever owned or taken camping. The zippers on the tent are two way , and you can separate the tent into two rooms. We like to do adults on one side kids on the other , and we let them project movies from the inside of they end into their tent wall . This camping tent comes with a carry bag if you roll everything up nicely it can al fit back in as it came. It weighs under 25 pounds so easy to hike with if needed. Great price for a great tent!This huge tent arrives in a box with zipper bag that is slightly larger than our 6 man tent. We did not have to use the instructions since the three photos on the product page show how to layout the tent and slide the five sets of poles prior to the hoisting them upward and placing into their pole pocket. I do agree that 3 or more people will make this easier to put together. Other bystanders were taking notice and some mention I was thoroughly surprised at how easily this tent went up! I was incorrect assuming that setup was going to take HOURS which meant more than 20 minutes when you are setting up or breaking down camp. But the directions were simple, straight-to-the-point, and were actually stitched into the bag where you store the tent!Honestly, this tent has been everything we imagined and more. It is extremely spacious and well-built. We got it to camp out in our backyard with it first before taking to the campground. The campground is very strict about how many people are on a site and distanced with pandemic rules so this tent was perfect to meet those regulations. We have not tried to fit 12 people into the tent but we have plenty of room to blow up 2 queen size air mattresses that are double high. We keep those to the center and store personal gear and bags towards the windows. We also appreciate the flooring that goes upwards away from the ground to keep the fall/spring dew from dampening our items and morning camping moods :)Bought this for our big family and so glad I did. We decided to take a camping trip to try this out and with our 4 kids, they were able to sleep on one side of the tent while the wife and I slept on the other side. Not only was there more than enough room for us, but for the kids as well. In the middle, we were able to zip up the divider to give us privacy from the kids that we normally don't ever have when we go camping. We have several cots that we were able to use on either side. What I love about this tent is even with the sleeping bags with sleeping mats and cots, we still have room with our luggage, shoes and so much more stuff. When it comes to putting this tent up, I followed the instructions and was really easy to do. I laid the tent down and had it all unfolded. I then placed the poles inside and with some help on the other side, we were able to put this tent up in no time. The tent itself measures about 20ft long, 9ft wide and 6ft high. There's more then enough room that we're able to walk around on the inside without crawling or having to hunch down. Even with a little wind, this tent is not going anywhere. When we were all done, we took this tent down and everything fits inside of the case that this tent came with. When it is folded down, it does weigh a little much but the handles makes it so much easier to hold everything. Once the weather warms up, we will definitely be using this tent a lot more. Plus, even though it was cold, we did open up the tent to see how it would vent out and boy does it vent. No more sweating inside a tent while just trying to grab something.This is a huge tent with two divider sheet that could be separated into 3 small rooms.� We are so glad we chose this tent for our family because it is so spacious for our family of two adults and 3 kids.� When we go camping with other family with kids, the kids like to get into a tent with lots of space to play and this tent is perfect for this.� The description says large enough for 12 people and I see more than enough space for 2 inflatable queen size mattresses.� The divider sheet could be used as a screen for the projector.�� This tent is windproof and waterproof and has so many windows and two doors.� We set up the tent in our yard to see the level of difficulty of the set up. To my surprise, the process of setting up the tent took my husband and I about 30 minutes, which is fairly easy for us.� I like that this tent comes with everything I need set it up and also comes with a bag to store everything in one place after camping is you have to worry about losing any small part.� My family really looks forward to do more camping when the weather is a little warmer.Took this camping last weekend. Living in San Diego we don�t see much rain I suppose the tent needed a water resistance review. It did rain and the tent stayed dry. My wife and I were quite impressed. My sons tent, not a CAMPRO did leak. Sorry son. I think it�s an excellent tent and the price I thought was a steal. I bought a tent a Dicks sporting goods for a prior camping trip it was expensive and very hard to setup and didn�t have a room divider like this one. I used it once and back to the store it went.I will be camping again in a couple of weeks. I�ll take some pics and update the review.Pro's:","Pro's:

[Perfect Dome Top]Designed with Arc Shape and Rip-lock fabric. It's stable and strong enough based on eight supporting steel tubes inside, and the joint of the beams designed with triangular structure to enhance stability. Vented roof can reduce wind stress on the top during windy days, this gazebo can withstand various weather conditions..

[Netting Walls& Pole Coverings]Netting Walls with zipper provide you a comfortable environment and keep your privacy.Pole Coverings protect legs from sun and rain,and make the gazebo more elegant.(Pole Coverings only instead of curtain panel, kindly note)***Update 1/5/2022- Yes, we still love this gazebo but I wanted to note that we had two storms with winds in the 30 to 35 hour range that we were very concerned about but the gazebo stood strong with no issues, I have recommended this to friends and would buy again if needed, *****We love this canopy! It was a two man job but was assembled in less than 2 hours. Very sturdy and fits perfectly on our patio. Love the netting on all sides for easy access. It looks better than the pictures. Very happy so far with this purchaseI�m love with this gazebo, easy to ensamble, me and my husband did everything in two hours, excellent quality, everything was complete and fit perfect, my family loved to spend the afternoons sitting there with this warm weather in Florida, best purchase ever!!!I give ABC canopy five stars for both customer service and product quality. I had a mishap were accidentally ordered a different tent from Home Depot before ordering this tent on Amazon. When the tent from Home Depot arrived I thought it was this tent and complained to ABC canopy that they sent me the wrong product. After going back-and-forth many times, I finally realized the mistake that I had made. ABC�s customer service department was extremely professional and nice to me even when I was being impatient and rude. I apologized vehemently but still feel bad for the mishap. In terms of the tent, the quality could not be better. It is much higher quality than any other tents I�ve seen at the farmers market. The frame is very sturdy but also easy to set up and take down. The accessories are fantastic because they allow for lots of different weather conditions. The fabric is very high-quality and blocks the sun quite well. I am extremely happy with my purchase!After lots of research and reading of reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I live in Hawaii so it gets hot, rainy, windy�everything. I have a small 8x8 wooden patio and this gazebo is perfect for it. Assembly took maybe an hour with two people. It would probably be doable with one person but I wouldn�t recommend that. The individual welds in the pieces are very poorly done so be careful when putting it together so you don�t bend one of the pieces. Once put together it sort of stabilizes itself. So far it seems sturdy and looks very nice. I screwed it directly into my wooden deck. Overall, I am super happy with it. Delivery was very fast and I now get a lot more use out if my outdoor space??I was worried having seen and used many pop up canopies in the past. I read the reviews and thought, I�ll see. My wife needing a new one for a swap meet bought another brand and I bought this one. Hers has never made it up in the air without issue, save $20 and it will cost you, buy the real deal and don�t worry about being pinched, leaning, collapsing, junk. The ABC is awesome, bag is awesome, wheels on the bag.....awesome! Easy up with one but it�s easier with two, shade curtains, awesome, I couldn�t be happier with the purchase and when the time comes that I need another, I know what I am going to buy and it will say ABC on it! I use it at the house, at car shows, sporting events, parking lots, grass, asphalt, concrete. Don�t wait, don�t hesitate, make sure you have room to haul it, and then buy it and enjoy it worry free!Pro's:","Pro's:

Callaway engineers used A.I. to design a completely new Jailbreak system which spreads and angles the Jailbreak blades.. Every model and every face in our fairway woods are uniquely designed using advanced A.I. The A.I. face is forged using a high strength C300 Maraging Steel for speed and spin consistency across the face.. The oversized head combines with a shallow face to make Epic MAX fairways extremely easy to launch.. Launch and spin are tunable using 2 & 14g weights. Use the heavy weight in the rear for more forgiveness or use the heavy weight in the front for lower launch and spin.This is the perfect club to have in my bag.

Text: 100% Polyester. You will receive one 18 ct box of Pure Protein Bars, Variety Pack (Chocolate Peanut Butter 6ct, Chocolate Deluxe 6ct and Chewy Chocolate Chip 6ct), 1.76 oz. PERFECT COMBINATION: Pure Protein Bars are the perfect combination of high protein, low sugar (1), and great taste. DELICIOUS HIGH PROTEIN BAR: Pure Protein Bars Variety Pack have 20g or 21g of protein (depending on flavor) for quick and sustained energy, and is gluten free. ON-THE-GO PROTEIN SNACK: Pure Protein Bars fuel your on-the-go active lifestyle. These protein bars are packed with a high quality protein blend for both quick and sustained energy, and full of flavor to satisfy your sweet tooth one bite at a time. PRE- AND POST-WORKOUT FUEL: Pure Protein Bars are perfect for before or after a workout. Grab a protein bar about an hour before a workout to provide carbs and protein for energy and lean muscle support. Treat yourself after your workout to replenish energy and help the muscle recovery process. Fuel your workout and nutritious balanced dietI became confined to a power chair, so I can't do much in the line of exercising anymore. I was gaining a lot of weight. I talked to my niece who's a nurse practitioner & she helped me with learning to eat better. She said I needed more protein in my diet & recommended these bars as a possibility. I love them! They taste really good, they curb the sweet cravings & give me lots of protein in the process! It's taken me 10 months, but I'm down 18 pounds!nanI have been buying these Pure Protein bars for a few years now. They have been an excellent product all around. However I've noticed in the past year the bar has been slowly shrinking. At first I didn't mind but now it's gotten completely out of hand. They've literally chopped away a third of the original bar's size and there's more wrapper hanging than every before. I am very disappointed in Pure Protein for thinking they can cut costs without consumer's noticing. Let's see how much they care about their bottom-line when they start losing customers. I've begun switching to Costco's Kirkland protein bars.I love to bake almost as much as I love to eat. That's a perfect combination for packing on the pounds and risking Type II Diabetes, which does run in my family. Going on principles I've been reading about since The Drinking Man's Diet, way back when I was thirteen, I changed just two things in my diet and have seen remarkable results. I've lost 20 lbs., gotten my blood lipids under control, and have stable blood sugar. The first change was eliminating as much sugar as possible, including diet beverages, and the other was upping my protein intake. After trying several ways of upping the protein, these bars turned out to be our favorite. We like the taste and the convenience. They are now a regular item on our Subscribe & Save list. Getting off the sodas was one of the hardest things I've ever done, took about four months for the cravings to go away, but once it was over, it was over. Sodas now taste nasty sweet, while these bars taste sweet enough to stop cravings in their tracks.What in the heck? This plastic better not have contained anything in it! I was right in the center.Pro's:","Pro's:

Display: This frame will fit a 20�x28� Picture/Photo/Poster/Puzzle. 20�x28� is the inside dimensions of the frame. The viewable area is reduced by .25� on each side due to the lip of the frame..

Custom Packaging: Custom packaging to ensure safe delivery of picture frame.. Shipping: Orders are made and shipped from Chicago.This seems to be a high quality frame if not a bit high priced. The frame was lost in shipping but once notified through Amazon the ""Picture Frame Factory Outlet"" was very prompt in their reply and I had theframe very shortly after; excellent customer service. Our puzzle dropped into the frame perfectly as we did not have to trim the puzzle a bit. The retaining clips to hold the puzzle/backing worked great. The shipping packaging is very well done and very well thought out for such a vulnerable item; vert heavy duty bubble wrap at all corners and the top. On the down side, a couple of the corners of the frame were a bit nicked and showed the underneath MDF board below the wrap; a black marker covered these small flaws. I wrote the vendors name on the back of frame so I can find again should I need an additional frame as I would buy again.This frame fit my puzzle perfectly. The construction was well done. The plexiglass has a film on both sides which prevented it from getting scratched (unlike the frame I bought first from a local store). The shipping packaging worked well to protect the frame. And the price was more reasonable the some of the other sellers. The only negative I had was the hanging wire has a plastic coating, which was nice, but it kept the wire from making a tight wrap. I ended up stripping off the plastic sheathing at the ends so I could get a tight wrap, otherwise it kept slipping off the rings.So I paid the extra money for these frames because they were puzzle size specific. That FAILED. Either the description is wrong or I was sent the wrong sizes. Either way I am very disappointed because now I have 2 puzzles that are actually too small in the frame and you can see the brown cardboard behind them. Not flattering on the wall.I mounted a puzzle that I finished in the hallway of our apartment building. I really like the frame and when I finished another puzzle I ordered another a matching frame. The next two frames arrived damaged, but I was happy with frame so I reordered until I received a good one.The order arrived almost a week early. Excellent packaging, good quality construction. I would certainly not hesitate buying again. I thought the price was a little high. I will keep an eye out for a coupon or special discount and purchase more frames.

Text: Available in three different designs, Sanabul Sticker Bomb Adult Boxing gloves are sure to be a hit with everyone. Perfect for Boxing, MMA, Kickboxing or any other striking class!. High quality and durable outer material is easier to clean with a sponge and soapy water. Impact Protection Foam is soft and durable to help prevent injury to hands. Secure Hook and Loop Closure System. Ensures a secure fit for training while making the gloves easy to put on or take off. Breathable palm keep hands coolerThese appear to be okay gloves, but when I took them out the packaging they were covered with what looks like cat hairs. Honestly don't know how one is to respond to that; so haven't decided if it is a deal breaker or not. Just feels icky though. The gloves themselves are pretty good looking and seem to be in mint condition- the three stars are basically only because they look even better than pictured. On a more practical note the inside of the gloves feels a little too plasticky to me in places (especially around thumb and finger area) but I usually wear hand wraps with my gloves so I'm hoping that won't be a comfort issue. Overall, for $30, I'm not entirely disappointed.Went from a pair of 16 oz Sanabul gel trainers to the 14 oz Stickerbomb gloves. I use them exclusively on a leather-like heavy bag. I really enjoy both pairs, but I'm adjusting to these a little bit.The wrist strap and sleeve feels sturdy and offers a nice bit of stability on hooks and uppercuts. The flatter profile on the sides really helps visibility when keeping guard up, and makes block transitions smoother. Obviously it offers a little more mobility due to the decreased weight, so jabs feel nice and snappy.Downsides are that the padding in the glove is tighter, so I can't use the padded under-wraps I already have, which isn't a huge issue since I managed a full training session without any discomfort. The design print is bright and clean, but it's printed on a spandex sleeve over the glove, instead on the glove itself. I'm worried about its durability, and on glancing punches I can feel the material move.Criticisms aside, I'm pleased with these gloves and will continue to use them. I'm the future I'll likely go for construction over fun style, but they're good for now!After seeing two other people at my gym have the exact same gloves, I return these. They fit rather snug and they�re hard to break in but I must say the impact that they can take is nice. They�re great for small children because it design is playfulReally nice gloves for 30 dollars. My son loves them! I�m not sure how easy to clean they are compared to traditional leather lace ups or how they will hold up just yet but they seem really nice. Will update if issue is found as they will be tested with mitt work and weekly sparring with my son.nanPro's:","Pro's: 
-Design is playful, perfect for small children
-Can take a lot of impact

If you're looking for a great teal velvet curtain you can't go wrong.nanI was unexpectedly impressed with these curtains. I have a couple sets of IKEA velvet curtains, and these are nicer in some ways. The velvet is softer and more plush, though I'm not sure they're quite as long as the 96"" they say they are.They are also very opaque, and darker than some supposedly ""blackout"" curtains I've had.You wouldn't mistake this velvet for cotton or silk velvet, but it is pretty nice.I would say the dark blue aren't quite navy blue, but darker than a royal blue. They're a true blue; I don't see any purple or green tones in them.Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised and I would absolutely order another pair if I needed more velvet curtains.I got these in black and they are almost blackout quality. They block nearly all of the summertime afternoon sun out. They also insulate quite well. I didn't realize how well they did this until the first cold morning of the fall, I opened my curtains as usual and was met with a gush of cold air. hahah. I closed them back up. :)Also I was hesitant about the velvet, as my house gets very dusty due to renovations next door. However, despite how many times I clean and dust, i really have no problem with keeping these BLACK, velvet curtains clean. I don't have a problem with the dust clinging to them.They're SO soft and perfect for bedrooms. I will be ordering more for the other bedrooms and even though I like a lighter feel in the living area, I love these so much, I might try them in the living room too!Great quality, super soft, rich color. Win-win.These are an amazing value! They are not as thick as more expensive velvet drapes - but that�s just it - they�re not expensive! For the price - these are really nice and look expensive.

I had to buy 3 packages with 2 curtains and the wall is 135 wide and 108 height. I washed them on cold water and on gentle cycle and I also Ironed and they didn�t shrink or change color. It turned out really nice.Great product. Exactly as described and totally worth the cost. Have been trying to find the perfect curtain and these are definitely the winner!

They filter the light without making the room completely dark and closed in.Beautiful and simple, these are light and let in just enough light without compromising privacy.

In case, we are unable to solve your issue, you can contact the Amazon Customer Support to replace them for free.Hi - I ordered two sets of these to display my photos in an exhibition. I have used many types of frames - these are of exceptional quality and win hands down compared to others in this price range - *I highly recommend*.Pros:- They frames look great, I was surprised by the high quality/great design of the product. I will buy again.- They are very sturdy and made of wood - definitely good enough for professional hangings.- They have plexiglass instead of glass which is great as most galleries will not let you hang glass (they are afraid the glass will break if the picture falls)- They are very easy to take apart and put together - a superior design.Con:- Smudge mark on the mats on one set - I ordered two sets, one set was perfect. However, on the other set (each set has two frames), I noticed a little smudge on the white mats. With close inspection, I realized it was from the protective plastic film that covers the plastic - the film has some recycling triangle recycling icons on it and it looks like it transferred to the white mat. I rubbed it off with a clean gum eraser and that solved the problem. I only mention it here so if others have this issue, they can resolve it - use a clean gum eraser. I am hesitant to even mention this one-off issue as was easily resolved and it only occurred on the one set - the other set was fine. **I still highly recommend this product and will definitely buy them again.**I purchased this as a Christmas Gift for my photographer friend.I chose black because it is a very classy timeless color that will fit most of the interiors/color-schemes etc.Plus my friend really enjoys black and white photography as a form of art.Frames arrived well packaged, each frame placed in a separate bubbly pocket.The screen is not glass but a sturdy thick quality plastic, a protective film is attached to it to make sure there are no scratches. I like that it is not glass because this means it will not break on occasional falls and there will be no cuts.There is also a white border inlay, that gives you the choice to either use a full sized picture inside or use the white border with a smaller picture.There is a black-and-white picture included with a frame, so you can use this b&w art and hang it straight as it is if you choose to.All in all, I am very satisfied with this purchase and I think my friend will like it as I definitely do.I�ve purchased 3 sets of these 11x14 or 8x10 Plexiglass picture frames. I love them. You�d never know it�s not real glass once the frame is put together & hung. Very classy. The frame is made of a sturdy black wood light material. I love how the frames can accommodate either size print. The price is good for what you get. In looking at them on my wall now I�d never guess I paid a great price for them. I foresee having for a long time. Hanging hardware is included. Even though I�ve purchased for myself I�d definitely give as a gift. Highly recommend!I'm a photographer who exhibits frequently and am starting to slowly convert all my frames away from glass to plexiglass. I had a show during the holidays, with smaller artwork, and ordered these frames, not knowing if they would work for me. I can tell you that the frames are of exceptional quality. The plexiglass is crystal clear, the frames of a good quality (wood), the corners are mitered and tight. I highly recommend these frames. Now I'm searching for similar products of a larger size frame, 16x20 or 18x24. If anyone can give me a lead, would much appreciate.One of my ""chores"" during quarantine has been to get all my good pictures out of albums and boxes, and get them framed so I can actually see them everyday. Naturally since they are of my fondest memories/friends/family, it has been a great mood lifter during this whole mess. Anyway, I ended up buying 48 of these and I can definitely say that they are an excellent purchase. They arrived extremely well packaged (You can even save the boxes for moving day because the frames fit back into the styrofoam box perfectly after you have removed them.) The frames are well made and I did not encounter any issues with any of the 48 units i purchased (i.e. broken glass, scratches, mis-aligned framework) I would definitely recommend this product.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Black 14x18 wall frame with contrasting double white mat opening for a 11x14 image. Airfloat mat adds dimension and depth to your art by creating a shadow effect with a separated double mat feature. Includes two EZ-Hanging Wall Grabber hanging brackets that can be repositioned for vertical or horizontal display and easy-to-use hanging template. Frame is crafted from durable solid wood with easy-open tabs on the back let you load your photos quickly. Lightweight protective glass will keep your favorite photos looking great for yearsThis is a great frame and it worked perfectly for me. I have seen some reviews where people have said that when the cardboard backing is removed to insert your photo that the backing will not fit back into the frame. This is true if you try to simply lay it into the frame but that's the wrong way to do it. There is a groove cut into the inside of the frame. You need to make sure the backing slides into that groove before trying to push it in. If you do this the cardboard backing will slide in perfectly. Hope that helps!Having worked in the framing business for over 20 years I know framing can be very, very expensive. This is an excellent purchase if you want something really nice and not pay crazy money!The frame is well made as is the double mat; perfectly beveled with no over cuts. It also came very well packaged with corner protectors and a mile of bubble wrap in a heavy duty corrugated box.Yes you can get a cheesy frame and mat cheaper but I have to say this is quite lovely and excellent quality. ??When I obtained my treasured Ongo Gablogian Print from my son-law I knew I had to have the perfect frame to capture the power of his presence. This frame features reflective real glass with a nice black-background dual layer matt. It feels substantial and looks great. The stepped corner plastic hanging hardware is unusual and somewhat questionable (BYO Nails) - but worked fine so far and allowed leveling.Ongo can't be contained in just any frame. His energy and sheer raw power have captured the hearts and minds of the art world since he crashed the scene in 2016, and I knew instantly that the unique and very rare print required the special care that only this frame could provide. Every morning as I stand before this shrine, lid up - I gaze upon his countenance and prepare to face the day - stronger and wiser from merely having glimpsed his image. I can only imagine what his wistful gaze is pondering upon...silent...and alone...I bought these for my house and again for a gift. My rating is based on the item itself and not the packaging. The wood is a pretty Brazilian cherry style appearance. The mat is an egg shell white and cut at a bevel. The �kick stand� in the back is well structured so the picture stands up well with a slight angle. If you plan to give as a gift, please note that the cardboard box it comes in looks like it had been through World War II in both of my separate purchases. When I gave it as a gift, I had to take it out of the box it came in and place into something more presentable.My youngest served 4 years in the Navy and just graduated college. I needed a double 5x7 frame (far right). This frame completed my Wall of Pride. Three college graduates, one also a vet! It is a high quality frame and was a perfect fit for my needs.

Text: Comes with Regular Glass and a Sawtooth Hanger for wall mounting!. Made of Wood - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it! Please Note: Actual color and wood grain may vary depending on the cut of wood and wood color.. For other colors and non-standard sizes in this frame style search '2WOMD6661-4x4' on amazon.com. Fits 14x18 inch Photos! Actual Frame size (finished size) is 16x20 inches and the frame is 1.25 inches wide and 1 inches high. This frame has a .25 inch lip and 0.5000 inch rabbet (space between the lip and back of the frame).. This frame is not you generic Picture frame but a custom design that you won't find anywhere else.Very disappointed. The frame is plastic, painted to look like wood. The edges aren't flush and one corner is chipped. The ""plexi glass"" is a super thin acrylic sheet that came with a scuff mark.... this looks like a cheap Dollar Store frame. Not worth the money and not what I want hung up in my business office.I ordered two of these frames and I have to say, I was not expecting much at all. I was expecting cheap, as I was paying cheap. However, these are clearly not real wood. These appear to be particle board or MDF made to look like wood. Now, the reason I know this is because both of these came in broken in multiple spots and the plexiglass as well.The packaging was horrible. It was wrapped in plastic wrap and stuck into cardboard instead of any padding or bubble wrap. Mind you these WERE bought buy the actual company Art To Frames, AND they were even stamped on the box it came in.Yes, this is in part the UPS's fault, however with proper packaging these would have been fine. I HIGHLY recommend staying away from this, as it's going to be VERY hit or miss, and please DO NOT put anything of real value in here. The backing was cardboard that was uneven and would cause damage and bends in your print (mine are hand pulled cotton prints from an artist) and the plexi is VERY thin and bends easily.The frame itself is also very fragile, and bends EXTREMELY easily. This is again due to the very cheap materials they used to make these.Now, I wouldn't have been as surprised but on their website these are nearly $100 frames.If this was $20 a frame, I wouldn't be surprised, but these are $50 and $65 frames here on amazon.AS FOR LOOKS: This is another key factor. The frames I ordered don't look like what I ordered hardly at all. The dimensions given in their description of how wide and deep the frame itself is are both wrong.PLEASE BE CAREFUL if you are looking for a cheap solution to an expensive/ semi expensive print or poster. I would recommend only putting things costing around $10 in this or things that you can have remade. My prints are not very expensive but are limited (both out of 25) from an artist and would be unable to be replaced.Here are the problems with this frame:- The plexiglass is too small for the opening of the frame and POPS OUT! (see photos)- I ordered a 16""x24"" frame and what I got is 16 1/4""x24 1/8""- The backing is straight up corrugated cardboard- It looks like a cheap, tacky frame- The plexiglass is difficult to clean because dust and fuzz cling to it- The plexiglass scratches easily! I wiped it down with a soft, clean, damp cotton cloth and it still scratched the surfaceThe positives:- It seems relatively sturdy and if you handle it gently it should stay that way...maybe.- It was packaged wellOverall, this frame is cheap in every sense of the word and is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.You can check my review history. It's rare for me to write a negative review. But this frame's plastic front detracts from the picture it's displaying and that's the primary purpose of the frame.The plastic front (what used to be glass) is a thin flexible sheet of clear plastic. In the instructions, they tell you that ""one or both"" sides of it is covered in a plastic layer that needs to be peeled off. Well my husband and I both tried and tried, with our fingers, with our nails, with strong tape, with pins, with tweezers, and we could not get any plastic layer off. Either it's not on there - in which case, they need to send accurate instructions - or it's darned near impossible to remove.The plastic sheet also had a couple of markings (light scratches) on it that I couldn't get out. And they're positioned so that one or the other of them is going to end up right over my son's head.On the plus side, the frame itself is as gorgeous as I'd hoped (thus the two stars) and it came well packaged. Don't buy this if you're in a hurry though because it takes some time to arrive.I was disappointed that I had to measure, place, and hammer in the sawtooth hanger myself. Needless to say, Martha Stewart would not be impressed. The packaging said I could choose between sawtooth and the included wire hanger assembly. But there was no wire hanger assembly included. A shame because with my skills, that would have resulted in a more perfect hang.If you can find another frame you like, buy it. This one's a pain in the a** and the ""glass"" front may have noticeable scratches. But if you can't, this'll do. Just set aside some time and patience. And if you don't find any plastic sheet to remove from the glass panel, don't sweat it. It's probably not there.This review is for Art to Frame product WOMD5026-14x18. The frame is wood with glass. Very sturdy and well made. From the product photo, I had imagined gold beaded trim surrounding a light brown core. It is actually all gold...""muted"" perhaps, but definitely gold. It works, but it is different than I had imagined. As others have mentioned, the sawtooth hanger is not attached. I assume this is either simplifies shipping or is for customer flexibility. It would not be fun to mount this hanger on the frame using a hammer or pliers. I drilled 1/16"" holes and pressed it in to place. A bit of a bother. If the manufacture doesn't, for some reason, want to install the hanger, they could at least pre-drill the mounting holes for either vertical or horizontal use....Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Sturdy and well made 
-Flexibility with wall mounting 
-Can be hung vertically or horizontally 
Con's: 
-Different than expected color 
-Sawtooth hanger not attached 
-No pre-drilled holes for mounting",29

PROUDLY MANUFACTURED IN THE USASo this is a great frame, really. I love it. It came with everything I needed (foam board, hanging equipment) to frame my family photo. I love that the �glass� is more of a plexiglass that does not show fingerprints. It looks like real glass though! The size was perfect and I am super impressed by the quality. I would definitely buy this again.I don't usually write reviews but I was shocked enough by the quality of this frame to log in and write one. Wow! Amazing quality for $30! I was expecting something a bit more basic. This frame makes my poster look and feel like I had it professionally framed. Excellent choice!My frame arrived in only two days after 5-7 days was predicted. It came priority and carefully packaged. The frame itself is just perfect and is a hard to find 9x9 size! It now holds my 3d diamond painting project. The clear front piece was covered on both sides with a blue protected film. It has a firm insert to hold my picture, and the back is held in place with several metal tabs. It includes a tabletop stand flap and a tack in brace to he ysed with a nail on the wall. I am very, very pleased with my frame??I�m an art teacher, artist, and free lance illustrator who has been framing art for well over 50 years and so have used many different kinds of frames from many different vendors. I wish I�d found these years ago. They are wonderful frames. Solid and attractive, they come in a large variety of sizes and are a complete package at an unbelievable price. With everything you need included they are a pleasure to use and give the professional resultsI purchased the frame to display a puzzle given as a gift. The item arrived quickly and packaged securely. As a matter of fact, after the puzzle was framed, the packaging was reused to forward the gift safely halfway across the United States. The trip seems to attest to the fact that it is a sturdy product.The item itself is just amazing! I was impressed with how solid the poster frame felt when I removed the back to place the puzzle into it. I was concerned that the puzzle would shift during shipping to its destination, and I if I am completely honest, it did shift slightly, but it was only noticed by the recipient when I inquired about it. I purchased the modest flat black color to match any decor, as the gift was for a military person expected to change living spaces frequently. A personal touch to decorating always adds warmth to a room, no matter where it is. The gift recipient was happy with the gift.Overall, I would highly recommend this frame for photos or other mediums such as the puzzle I used it for.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: OUTPERFORMS FIBERGLASS, WASHABLE AND NON-ELECTROSTATIC 3-month pleated 1 in. home air filters for your furnace, air conditioner or HVAC system. DESIGNED WITH EXCLUSIVE Filtrete Brand 3-in-1 technology from 3M to trap unwanted air particles while letting cleaner air flow through. ATTRACTS AND CAPTURES microscopic particles such as smoke, cough and sneeze debris, bacteria and viruses--and large particles, including lint, household dust and pollen. 2800 MPR has a rating of MERV 14. The higher the MPR, the more microparticles--such as pollen, pet dander, smoke, bacteria and viruses--your filter will capture from the air passing through it. 81% SMALL PARTICLE CAPTURE, like bacteria and particles that carry viruses ( % captured is based on ASHRAE 52.2 testing for 0.3 to 1 micron particles from the air passing through the filter, which relates to HVAC industry standard efficiency testing). CERTIFIED as asthma & allergy friendly (As outlined in report ASCR: 1246-01)This is a AMAZING filter from Filtrete. I currently live with a stubborn pack a day smoker that refuses to go outside to smoke. Unfortunately I currently live in dallas,tx where its unbearably hot outside ten months out of the year, so opening up a window to air out the two bedroom apartment i live in is not a option. The central air always runs which stirs the smoke to every room of the apartment (including mine.) So after researching HEPA air purifiers, a suitable purifier was $500+, which is out of the question currently. I found "" Toms Beter Box Fan"" website where he had instructions on how to make a DIY Box Fan purifier for the cost of two filters and a box fan. I decided to make one. Some people put a 20x20x1 filter on the back of the fan and call it good, not the best idea. The cheapo motors on a Walmart box fan are not designed to take the strain. So to solve this you simply take two 20x25x1 filters and ""hinge"" them together onto the intake side of the box fan, cut & tape cardboard from your amazon box onto the top of the filters creating a tight seal. BOOM a DIY Purifier for ~$50! I WAS SO HAPPY when Filtrete came out with these 2800 series filters! The highest quality available in these sizes that are capable of filtering tobacco smoke! Also i loved the 2 pack they come in (perfect for my double filter box fan.) After the 2 pack filters arrived all i needed was some white gorilla duct tape, box fan, knife and 30mins to create my air purifier. These filters work on ULTRAFINE PARTICALS like smoke, smog and 2.5m pollution. After running my better box fan in the smokers room for a just a hour the air cleared and could just see the tar and yellow filth on the filter surface. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS 2800 SERIES FILTERS! Worth the extra money, solid heavy duty construction made to last as well.I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, since well it does what ti says, it filters the air with a higher efficiency. HOWEVER, there is a cost associate with that efficiency and it comes at the cost of your electric bill and at the health of your blower motor for the HVAC system.Virtually all Residential HVAC systems were not built/balanced to pull through such thick media. Sure they will do it, but they will struggle. The multivriate fans that will increase power in order to accommodate the CFM the system was designed to, the increase in power will increase the energy use of the system and risk blowing out the motor (overheat/overwork). The single stage fans will just reduce the CFM of the system providing inadequate heating and cooling which will result in longer HVAC run time (to heat or cool the space) resulting in higher cost of elect and higher probability of the motor burning out.All the flow rates are measured at lab levels with brand new filter...now one must understand that as soon as the filter encounters real life environment the filter will clog up. The higher the efficiency of filtration the higher the rate the filter will clog up and reduce the air flow (exacerbating the effects above).My advice to anyone looking at this, is either replace it every 2 to 3 weeks to keep the system healthy or get a dedicated whole house HEPA addon to the HVAC system (it's a dedicated blower with filter media) or purchase the HOLMES 5"" to 1"" conversion filter that provides a 5"" filter in a 1"" space, this allows for high filtration and high CFM (since now it's 5"" thick media as opposed to easily plugged 1"" media).Images speak a thousands words.I run the furnace fan 24 hours a day/ 7 days a week. Always keeping the air moving and thus, being cleaned.I have a recording studio and I want the air to be as clean and free of flying debris as possible.I have been using these filters for many years and they have not disappointed.Photos show the results of 24 hours/7 days a week for 3 months. This is dirty SoCAL air.I'd also like to add that I was very near the fire zone of the recent fires we just had and although there was soot, ash flying about outside, i could not smell any of that inside.These are not MERV 14 air filters, though the packaging says so. The pleating is at least half as dense as those I�ve purchased previous to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our air quality is so poor, we could tell immediately. How frustrating to find that the old filter was far superior than these new, fake, falsely advertised filters. I�ve posted pictures comparing the pleating density of the fake MERV 14 and the real, pre Covid 19 one.I'm someone who sleeps in the basement of my house. I bought a 10 pack of generic filters (on a particular ""group coupon"" site) and eventually started getting sick. Sprung and paid the cash for the Filtrete, and my air quality at the house is now incredible. These filters might be overkill, but I'm only going to buy Filtrete going forward. And to ease my concerns about the filters being ""counterfeit"" (according to some Amazon reviews), I called 3M and they assured me that I had purchased a genuine product.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Traps unwanted air particles
-Lets cleaner air flow through

In this review, I'll be contrasting these frames with a set of frames by Lorell I purchased last year. I liked those frames, but they were not available at the time of purchase, so I purchased these instead. All 3 frames arrived intact without any damage. Assembly was straight forward: undo tabs and remove backer, remove film from both sides of the acrylic sheet and place back in the frame, add the poster and put the backer back on and redo the tabs. This is pretty much identical to the Lorell frames with the exception of the tabs. These tabs do not dig into your fingers like the Lorell's did, so that was a nice improvement. Unfortunately, the tolerances are not as tight on these frames, resulting in the poster shifting inside the frame a little bit. It's not much, but given these cost twice as much as the Lorell frames, I expected at least similar quality. The acrylic sheets also have quite rough edges; these are concealed by the frame and are not visible, but continues to speak to the corners that were cut. The frame also had two mounting brackets instead of one in the center. This is unnecessary for a frame this size and it makes it more challenging to hang, as you need to level it, rather than letting gravity do its thing. Ultimately, the frame is decent and side-by-side look identical to the Lorell frames I purchased last year. The corners cut along with being twice the price make me wish the Lorell frames were available at the time I purchased (they appear to be back as I write this). But they work decently enough in a pinch without being too expensive.I don't understand the low ratings on these. The ones I got were sturdy, extremely well packaged and shipped quickly. The Plexiglas IS very thin but has protective film on both sides when you receive it, so if you're putting yours on a wall like most people do it will work fine. I've used them for posters I will put on a condo wall. You guessed it - in Florida!I ordered both the 16x16 and 20x20 frame and they both have a very noticeable distorted shape to them. Both curve in towards the center and flare out at the corners, giving them a concave/hourglass shape, instead of a straight square shape. When I measured them, there was almost a 1/8"" decrease in the width across the center when compared to the width across the two bottom corners or the two top corners. Since both of these sizes had this incorrect shape, it's probably a common error with this product. I will be returning themHardwood frame first most important to me and all angles to be placed. Came professionally wrapped and boxed to prevent any damage. I greatly appreciate your dedication bringing a frame worth the price. 5 ?? recommended thumbs up ??For the price, yes it�s a good deal but I did think I was getting glass and not a flimsy piece of clear plastic. Once hung on the wall I�m not sure you can even tell thoPro's:","Pro's:

Text: Ridiculously delicious : BSN broke through the whey protein flavor barrier once and for all with the introduction of syntha-6. 22 gram protein matrix : Consisting of whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, calcium caseinate, micellar casein, milk protein isolate, and egg albumin. 2-3 gram sugar : While the taste is mind blowing, syntha-6 contains 2-3 gram of sugar per serving depending on flavor. Use any time of day : Post workout, between meals, as a snack, or as a treat, it doesn�t matter. BSN syntha-6 was formulated to be your any time of day protein powder. Protein supplementation : Promotes muscle protein synthesis and recovery supportI found a bug is this protein powder today. Can't belived that I have drink half of the cask.I will not purchase this product agian and I am going to report this to USDA.My husband has been taking this protein powder in his morning smoothie for months now. It keeps him full until mid morning when he eats a fairly large snack. A week ago he had blood work done and it came back that his cholesterol numbers were all high including his triglycerides. Hes always been fit, now that we�re older he eats pretty healthy, runs a few times a week (1.5-2 miles), and his waist to hip ratio is in the �good� range BUT heart disease runs in his family. So I�m not sure if this protein powder is necessarily to blame (hence the 3 stars) but it definitely doesn�t help that the cholesterol is so high and the ingredients include triglycerides.I�m not an expert in cholesterol, I just wanted to point this out to anyone else that may have heart disease in the family. It�s not worth the risk. Without the blood work we wouldn�t have known.I�ve switched our subscribe & save to a natural, plant based protein and will update later to see if things have changed.Good luck to all of your on your quest in finding a good quality and affordable protein powder. For us, this wasn�t it.I�m an athletic/average college student. I�ve tried many protein brands, and this the best tasting and most nutritious one I�ve ever had. It comes in a bag with 97 servings, that�s a lot of servings. It instantly blends with milk or water and tastes like a milk shake, no need to even use a blender. It tastes amazing. It doesn�t have that thick protein whey powdery taste other brands have. It can also be used as a meal replacement, it has essential amino acids, protein, fiber, and I use this as my breakfast every morning mixed with a glass of unsweetened almond milk. I�m definitely going to buy this product again, I just hope that maintain the same price point. Other than that, this product is great tasking, very nutritious, satisfying especially hunger, and is helping me build lean muscle. This product is a great part of my fitness routine. So glad I found this product on amazon!This powder is GREAT, it's the best tasting whey protein I've tried. It also mixes really easily. Other lesser protein powders can be clumpy and chewy. The syntha-6 powder all mixes into a great drink with little effort.I've tried cookies and cream and it was good but you get little pieces of cookie at the bottom of your glass that you can't seem to get to. The strawberry is my favorite though. It's a subtle but delicious strawberry flavor.BTW ignore the other reviewer that said it raised her husbands cholesterol level. She has no clue what shes talking about. Studies show that everyday consumption of whey protein significantly lowers bad cholesterol. I've been using this whey protein for a year now and just had my blood work done, my numbers are great across the board!! I know everyone's body is different but there are multiple factors that can attribute to his increased cholesterol numbers. Blindly blaming one product for the cause of bad health is just wrong...Purchased Banana the taste is amazing. BSN always has GREAT Products. Pushing 55 is hard but with great products like this I stay fit and motivated. FYI -Stay away from Precision Engineered products it taste aweful and I guess that's why it's on sale three 5 lb containers for 75 dollars. Amazon delivered in two-days and on a Sunday! Thanks AMAZON love being a prime member.Pro's:","Pro's:

I can use it as a monitor or just to watch Netflix lol. It has 3 holes to run cords thru ( one on the left... the middle...& one the right) I hid all my cords behind the filing cabinet....& I can�t stop gushing about my new desk....It took me & my husband about an hour to assemble & as you can see in my pics ... everything came labeled & with stickers...so it�s pretty straightforward to put together.... don�t think twice about it.... it�s an awesome desk.So I have mixed feeling on this desk, I do love this desk. It is sturdy and perfect height and has a great amount of desk space. The only issue I have is the box arrived super bear up and looked torn to pieces and like it was just being held together by A LOT of tape. Now I�m not gonna be using this box again so I don�t much care but I was a bit worried since the corners looked so beat up I was worried about the inside product. So the surface of my desk is perfect, no cracks or dents but the edges? Yup. Beat to heck. Completely messed up. Up really upset since 2 of my corners are so beat up that one is smashed inwards and the other was smashed and the top couple of layers are gone. I will me moving soon so I don�t have the time to send it back and hope the next one is in great shape. I�m gonna have to come up with a way for my edges to not peel back now, I�ve already cut myself on one of the corners already since it�s jagged so I�ll have to find a way to make it smooth too. I do think the table itself is amazing and beautiful and I love it, but the inside packaging to protect it just wasn�t enough and that sucks.I bought this desk for my son, and when it arrived, the box looked like it had been run over. The packing itself was well done, but the carrier must have gotten out some frustration on this box. Amazingly, the only pieces that were damaged were two of the desktops - the corners were damaged, and the particle board was poking through.I contacted the seller, and the seller generously offered to refund part of the purchase because there were no desks available. Because I was able to put the desk together, and it was a cosmetic issue, I asked if just the two pieces could be sent to me when they were back in stock. Chris at customer service sent me a complete new desk about 2 weeks later, and it arrived in perfect condition.This whole experience says a lot about this company. The damage was the result of the carrier, yet Bestier stood behind their product and provided a replacement. And customer service provided several options and worked with me to get to the right solution.Thanks, Chris and Bestier - great job!! You're the best-ier!The desk is great - it's fairly easy to put together, and took about an hour. My son loves it - lots of usable space. Great product!Overall: I am surprised with how happy I am with this desk. I bought it in a rush with plans to switch it out when IKEA was back in stock with a desk I wanted originally. I neglected to check dimensions, just assumed it was around 72 inches. It wasn�t a problem, just surprising how much space is on this thing. I can comfortably fit my PC, 55 in monitor, two laptops, a printer and a few notebooks on the surface and still have some extra space. The moveable mount has been helpful for my laptop during zoom meetings.Assembly: Very easy! I messed up twice and it was no effort to fix in the moment. Comes with all you need to assemble it, and I even used the extra parts to fix a stool I had around. My only issue was getting the table tops to be level when assembling. I can feel the bumps from one table top to the next, but that might have been how I assembled it.Height: I�m 5�8� and tend to keep my chairs on lower settings because of bumped knees. This is a good height that required me to raise my seat for onceLeg room: Ample. My dogs even crawled under it and slept while I was playing (lab and pitbull mixes).Sturdy: Not superbly so. I could easily lift it and move it around on my own (it�s about 50 lbs). If you have it leaned against a wall with all your office equipment on it, it should be fine. If you plan on having it free standing at a side, you might risk moving it a bit too much.Materials: The desk is a cheaper looking plywood-like material. Water resistant, not soaking up any of my drink spills while I�m working at the desk. Though, if you leave a spill on the surface unattended it may absorb the liquid.Super happy with this purchase, and planning on keeping this desk for a while now.This was one of the easiest pieces of furniture to assemble I've ever bought. Everything comes labeled nicely and the instructions are really easy to follow. It has the capability to be put together as a corner desk or a long straight desk and I did the corner configuration. It looks great! Nice and roomy with nothing to bang your legs into underneath. My previous work from home setup was really cramped and this is nice and roomy for my extra monitors and other office equipment. Really pleased with my purchase!Pro's:","Pro's:

Great product!Overall: I am surprised with how happy I am with this desk. I bought it in a rush with plans to switch it out when IKEA was back in stock with a desk I wanted originally. I neglected to check dimensions, just assumed it was around 72 inches. It wasn�t a problem, just surprising how much space is on this thing. I can comfortably fit my PC, 55 in monitor, two laptops, a printer and a few notebooks on the surface and still have some extra space. The moveable mount has been helpful for my laptop during zoom meetings.Assembly: Very easy! I messed up twice and it was no effort to fix in the moment. Comes with all you need to assemble it, and I even used the extra parts to fix a stool I had around. My only issue was getting the table tops to be level when assembling. I can feel the bumps from one table top to the next, but that might have been how I assembled it.Height: I�m 5�8� and tend to keep my chairs on lower settings because of bumped knees. This is a good height that required me to raise my seat for onceLeg room: Ample. My dogs even crawled under it and slept while I was playing (lab and pitbull mixes).Sturdy: Not superbly so. I could easily lift it and move it around on my own (it�s about 50 lbs). If you have it leaned against a wall with all your office equipment on it, it should be fine. If you plan on having it free standing at a side, you might risk moving it a bit too much.Materials: The desk is a cheaper looking plywood-like material. Water resistant, not soaking up any of my drink spills while I�m working at the desk. Though, if you leave a spill on the surface unattended it may absorb the liquid.Super happy with this purchase, and planning on keeping this desk for a while now.This was one of the easiest pieces of furniture to assemble I've ever bought. Everything comes labeled nicely and the instructions are really easy to follow. It has the capability to be put together as a corner desk or a long straight desk and I did the corner configuration. It looks great! Nice and roomy with nothing to bang your legs into underneath. My previous work from home setup was really cramped and this is nice and roomy for my extra monitors and other office equipment. Really pleased with my purchase!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: CHECK YOUR FIT - Nominal size: 20x25x4; Actual size: 19 1/2""x24 1/2""x3 3/4""; This MERV 13 filter is comparable with MPR 1500-1900 & FPR 10.. SUPERIOR FILTRATION EFFICIENCY - Aerostar filters are made with electrostatically charged synthetic material that draws and captures allergens including lint, dust mites, mold spores, pollen, pet dander, and dust.. IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY - Protect your family and loved ones with clean indoor air quality at home. Aerostar filters are a simple to install and cost-effective step towards a healthier home environment, free of airborne allergens and particles that can trigger various allergy and asthma symptoms.. HIGH PERFORMING - 100% synthetic electrostatic media for high efficiency with low air flow resistance. For best results, change your filters every 60 to 90 days during normal times of year but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months when your unit is working the hardest.. MADE IN THE USA - Aerostar filters are manufactured in the USA by Filtration Group, a world-leading manufacturer and supplier of filtration solutions for residential, commercial and industrial applications.I purchased Aerostar MERV 13 filters in the 20x30x1, 14x30x1, and 12x12x1 sizes for my HVAC systems. As a point of comparison, I have always used 3M Filtrete filters in the red packaging. These either have a 1000 or 1085 MPR rating, which would be closer to a MERV 11 rating. Here are some things to note:- Each Aerostar filter was clearly labeled with respect to its nominal size, actual size, and MERV rating. No brand information is printed on the filters.- In all cases, the Aerostar filters have the same or more pleats than the 3M filters. Also, both the wire and paperboard framing for the Aerostar filters are more substantial than the 3M filters. Lastly, the Aerostar filter media just appears to be denser than that of the 3M filter, as it lets less light through. In theory, I'm expecting the Aerostar filters to perform best unless there is some more subtle difference in the filter media.- Irrespective of the actual dimensions printed, the Aerostar filters are always between 1 to 3mm smaller in each dimension compared to the 3M filters.- When installing the 3M filters, I have always found them slightly oversized such that I usually have to crush a filter's frame a bit to get it mounted. As a result, it is doubtful that any air can bypass the filter and the only way the filter moves is if I tug it firmly to remove.- When installing the Aerostar 20x30x1 filter, it remained snug to the vent frame and did not fall from the ceiling even with the HVAC fan off and grate open. If the filter was jiggled a little, it would fall though. In other words, it wasn't tight like a 3M filter.- When installing the Aerostar 12x12x1 filter, it did not stay snug to the vent frame. I had to slide it in and close the grate to keep it in place. Despite this, I haven't heard any filter movement when the fan turns on or off.- When installing the Aerostar 14x30x1 filter, it was similarly snug to a 3M filter.If a problem develops with any of the filters, I think I'll just use double sided tape to secure them as necessary. I am satisfied with this given how much I saved over buying 3M filters.- For reference, the actual dimensions printed on the 3M filters are 501mm x 755mm x 20mm, 349mm x 755mm x 20mm, and 298mm x 298mm x 20mm. In comparison, the actual dimensions printed on the Aerostar filters are 502mm x 756mm x 19mm, 352mm x 759mm x 19mm, and 298mm x 298mm x 19mm. Irrespective of the printed dimensions, the real world dimensions, as explained above, don't exactly match the specifications.- The 20x30x1, and 12x12x1 sizes were shipped directly from Amazon, while the 14x30x1 size was shipped from Air Filters Delivered. The filters shipped from Amazon were received in perfect condition as they were double boxed. The filters shipped from Air Filters Delivered were slightly battered and deformed.I recently had a chance to install these in my own home. I have a single return that measures 12x24, on a 2 ton Package unit. I know that this will only allows for 600 cfm of the required 800 cfm the system needs to operate properly, I just haven�t gotten around to enlarging it yet.Now that, that�s out of the way.. in regards to the filters, they are properly rated as the air the travels through them will be filtered properly. Unfortunately as others have mentioned they are undersized for a 12x24 return grill. I was expecting them to be a little undersized, but they are very undersized. So undersized in fact that my return grill whistles now. The whistling is coming from the edges of the filter, which means air is passing around the filter and not being filtered at all, I will be removing these filters and installing something that fits snuggly, and doesn�t allow the air to pass around them.I�m really not sure what the thinking was when designing these, if the whole purpose of a filter is to filter ALL of the air that returns to the system, then the filter should fit properly. 12x24 is a common size, and the manufacturer should have known and tested there filters to make sure to size them properly. MERV 13 doesn�t mean anything if air can get around them. I�m fairly disappointed, I was excited about having great air filtration, since I just installed the system, this is a variable speed system, and the whistling was noticeable in low speed, I haven�t tested in high speed, but I imagine it will be even worse, based on experience.We used this product to make n-95 style filters for masks for myself and other hospital staff during the Covid 19 outbreak when medical supplies are in short demand. Thank you for the great price. I was paying $20 for a single comparable filter!The filter was not even covered in plastic. It was literally exposed completely to the allergies and pollen as there was no cover at all. The entire purpose of buying these filters was to filter out allergies that I am allergic to. They are completely worthless and I had to order something else as these are nothing but trash. I am extremely frustrated and will never again order from this dishonest seller. This product advertised as reducing allergens in specific amounts and it is can not do that when both sides are exposed to allergies and once used, the allergens on the back would flood the air. It is not as advertised. I strongly recommend that people not trust this seller and I will not be buying anything from them again.These are wonderful. Everything that I was hoping for. I love that they're Merv 13 ( The standard rating for filter quality. Standard residential equals 1 to 4, better residential equals 5 to 8, superior residential equals 9 to 12, and hospitals is 13 to 16. A level 11 MERV filter can be expected to remove 60 to 65% of dust particles) I would buy a level 16 MERV filter if I could, but any sort of superior residential filter is difficult to find and often not worth the cost.I bought these to go into the 12x24 air inlet. I purchase the after market register covers from Lowes and self installed. What an amazing upgrade. We went from one filter on the furnace to two register filters (these) and the furnace unit. I would recommend this simple DIY and these filters to anyone.We've been doing construction on our home and I've been replacing these monthly. Our first month we had a good handlful of dust. So happy we avoided having that in our air and our new furnace.We will absolutely be repurchasing these in the future.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Gaucho collection saddle stool features walnut finish. Made of solid rubberwood. Available in dark brown color with a durable construction. Some assembly may be required. Measures 29-inch seat heightThe stool itself is very nice. It is a tad on the rustic side, which is exactly what I wanted. There are some distress marks and chiseled edging ... not a lot but enough to add interest and character. They were sturdy and I especially was happy to find stools with such a small ""footprint"", meaning that they tuck completely under my 12"" counter overhang. The color is great ... not at all reddish but a deep rich brown which allows the grain to show but blends nicely with my walnut and coco stains on my other furniture. I must add, though, that the seller I purchased from A Plus Trading, was a true nightmare. Honestly, it is hard to imagine that anyone selling on Amazon could possible deliver such hideous service. I ordered a total of 8 of these stools in mid-November, four in this 29"" six, two in a 24"" size and 2 in an 18"" size. THREE MONTHS AND FIFTEEN EMAILS and I STILL do not have two 24"" stools that are in a condition that can be used. Great product but strongly suggest choosing a different seller.Purchased two of these. The color is great - nice deep oak brown, matches perfectly w my oak floors. Unfortunately, one came with a 3 inch scratch on the top of the stool. Not worth returning though. Overall very decent, just would've been better without the scratch. Pretty comfortable - they're bar stools so nobody sitting on them for a long time.I ordered these stools to stage my home that I was selling so the price was perfect, I wasn't looking for something that would last through time. Unforturnately when I received the 1st set I ordered they were completely broken and had to be returned. I reordered them again and it was like the 1st set was reshipped to me since they were completely broken in the same place and I had to return them again. Needless to say I was never able use the stools and I would never order them again.Many are complaining about the stripping screws, I think the problem lies elsewhere: an allen key that is too small. I also stripped mine on the allen key it came with, but when I went up a size with my own key set, it fit better and the screws stayed in tact. Aside from this, the chairs are sturdy and attractive. I was concerned to see the chairs arrive that say that they contain a chemical known to cause cancer. I feel like this should be disclosed before purchase!Very sturdy nice stoolsPro's:","Pro's:

If you have any issue during using our products, please feel free to contact us.Accessories and parts are available for life time.I choose this tent because of the �windows �. Selling jewelry you need all the light you can get, the windows give me the light I need with the security of a wall. Easy to put up and pack away. I hope I will get years of service from this tent. Oh, and the crossbars in the roof allowed me to hookup lights over my tables!I use these canopies for vendor events, I sell Thirty-One Gift products and need my products to be protected when bad weather hits. The first day I used this we had one heck of a storm hit and not only was the canopy durable during some pretty bad wind gust but we did NOT see one drop of rain leak. I also like the walls with windows, we were able to see out during this storm and unfortunately saw many cheaper canopies getting pummeled. Definitely worth the price!I have begun participating in outdoor vendor events for my small business and wanted a tent that was made well that would last me a long time and provide me with good coverage from the sun and the weather on rainy days. We have only used this tent one time so far, but we are happy with it thus far. The frame of the canopy fits nicely in a rolling tote; however, the wheels do not come assembled on the rolling bag. The side panels and canopy did not come in the bag either - they were laying in the box outside of the carrying case. I do not believe that the side panels and canopy will actually fit in the bag. I wish they did to keep it all together; however, I have put them in another bag I have and its not too much of a hassle to carry the canopy around in two different bags. The metal frame went up pretty easily. My husband did it in just a few minutes his first time taking it out of the package. He says he isn't sure I would be able to do it alone though (I'm only 5 ft 2 in). Thankfully he is at most of my events with me. The canopy also includes sand bags - but they are not filled. So make sure before you go to use this canopy you make sure to get sand to fill the bags with. Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the tent. We haven't tested it out with the rain yet, so I'm not sure if it will be waterproof or not, but I have high hopes for it. I will update my review as I use it more.Out of the box this canopy must be a foot taller than my former 3 canopies that all eventually failed due to the frame breaking. This was somewhat easier to put up. The buttons are large and the most noticeable this is that even on the intermediate height I am able to walk under it without hitting my head. The side panels, with the windows are great and the white color is great for inside visibility. The case and wheels are well designed and the wheels have ball bearings. The center pole is unique and hopefully this canopy frame will survive better than the rest. Overall I am pleased with this purchase. However keep in mind stronger means larger and heavier.Love this canopy. It's proved to be waterproof on many occasions, withstanding heavy thunder storms. Easy to put up and take down.

Took less than 20mins to put up with my 10yr oldLet me just start by saying that the only thing I would change about this tent is the �instructions� to put it together. My fianc� and I went to put it together the first time and realized the three pictures we were looking at was all the instructions included on the construction of the tent. not very useful.. I can say that once we figured it out and once the tent was fully set up it was the perfect family tent. Everything I expected it to be and more. A lack of proper instructions is the only problem I have with this tent.Great value for the money. It was nice but abjt difficult to set upI like the tent a lot. I�m just a bit bummed b/c the canopy is also the door to the front, not in addition to. I got this tent for that feature and really couldn�t use it b/c it was flimsy and I also wanted privacy.The insert contained very little directions. There were huge gaps in the little information present so I just had to guess and hope for the best. After it fell down 4 times I went online and zoomed in on the pics to see what the instructions were missing. They say nothing about which pole goes where or how to install the rain fly. The poles were so loose in the connectors they would just slide back out and collapse. The walls are paper thin with super cheap zippers and the seam holes pop wide open with any kind of tension. This tent is worth about $20, not the $170 I paid for it.Pro's:","Pro's:

The Marineland product is a replacement for the previous HOT Magnum canister, which was excellent, but has been discontinued. The replacement unit sounds like you�re next to an old truck the entire time it�s running. Even set on a timer to run half the day, it was just incredibly annoying. I hope this unit lasts and performs well, but right out of the gate it is quiet. Which is appreciated!Judging by dimensions, operational is a surprise how quiet it can work. On full power the aquarium looks like a washing machine. In a 10 gallon tank suction is set to minimum and only one stage filtration is mounted. With little energy consumption the pump works great. Ultimately, the fish has to like it so pay attention to their reaction.I�m so impressed with this filter seriously it clean my tank in less than 1 hour cristal clean water when it was so dirty I didn�t know what to do now I actually see the back of the thank again and it was all just the filters job !!! I�m soo happy I never had such before BIY THIS IS WORTH!!!!I attached 4 pictures. 2 are immediately after instal, 2 are 22 hours later. I cleaned the sponges 2x over the past day because my tank was left with little maintance for over 6 months while I was away and turtles are dirty. Its incredible! It's basically acting as a passive vacuum clearing all the debris from the top of the rocks with no effort. Its also very quiet. Im a very light sleeper and i had no trouble at night with this thing operating, my air stone is louder than it is. Super easy to clean too! Less than 5 mins to thoroughly clean all the sponges and it comes apart easily but is strong when put together. Absolutely recommend to anyone with a larger tank or with reptiles or amphibians.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-The filter is very quiet
-The filter is easy to clean
-The filter is great for larger tanks
-The filter does a good job of cleaning the tank

We have a 30-day easy return policy on these curtain panels if you're not happy with your purchase.They are the perfect soft gray. They add color but allow plenty of light flow!! I purchased curtain rings to change it up a bit!! Very happy with this product!After returning a couple of curtains i settled on these and love them! As stated they are very sheer and lightweight and have a bit of a texture as you can see from my photo. The color didn�t come through in my photo but the natural color is a very nice off-white. My curtain rods and rings are from Ballard designs, so pairing a higher-end item with a not expensive item like these curtains worked out well! They look rich! You definitely need to steam the curtains as it makes a big difference!These curtains gave the perfect look we were going for. They help block the glare but still let light through to make the space feel open. These will NOT completely block the sunlight. We used 6 panels across the back wall of windows and 2 panels on our front window. If you want a more bunched or full look order more panels.The curtains seem very high quality. They are 70% linen which is perfect for that natural look. The price for what you get is very good. I will definitely buy these again. Compared to target curtains, these are better quality and for a much lower price. Target sells only one panel at a time for the same price as this ($35 for two in this order) and most of the time the quality is subpar from target.Love! Great quality. They let in a perfect amount of light for the living room. Went through 2 different sheer curtains before I found these and fell in love.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 50% Cotton, 45% Polyester, 5% Linen (84-inch) -Or- 46% Cotton, 42% Polyester, 12% Rayonne (95-inch). Lush D�cor Rosalie window panel set is the ideal curtain for your shabby chic, modern or farmhouse d�cor. Delicate, elegant window curtain panels made of a linen fabric blend with a lace edge border. These curtains add a dreamy touch for your bedroom, living room or dining room.Use Only Non-Chlorine Bleach When Needed. Fabric curtain material: 50% Cotton/45% Polyester/5% Linen. Curtains are not lined and have a 3� rod pocket. Due to the delicate nature of the design, these items are dry clean only. This Rosalie Window Panel Set will filter out some of the sunlight and provide privacy inside your home, but they will also let in a good amount of natural lightThese look stunning in our nursery. They are a natural blend fabric so have variations in texture. I think that adds to their beauty. They do not block much light but enough to make the nursery a good place for day time naps. The blush pink is soft and traditional. Great price. I ordered 4 sets and all curtains were the same measurements and same color.I like to write great reviews when I find a great product. These are exactly the farmhouse style I was looking for! This comes with 2 panels, you have the option of hanging them on a traditional rod or you can purchase drapery rings separately and hang them that way (which is what I chose to do). The curtains ironed very easily and the pattern on the edges gives them that extra touch. Very happy with this purchase.I ordered one pair of the Lush Decor Rosalie Curtains just to see if they'd work in my dining room. Loved, loved them! the color received was a beautiful warm ivory shade perfect for the room, the fabric was a crisp cotton lightweight 'canvas' texture. I ordered 3 more pair and received a totally different color and quality. The curtains in the second order are a grayish shade made of something like cheap painter's dropcloth. I am returning all 4 sets. I cannot use the gray-colored ones and I don't want to order more only to gamble on what color i might receive. If all 4 sets could match the color of the first set received I'd be completely satisfied. Also, If all 4 sets were the right color, I'd give this product a 4 or 5 star rating (can't determine the final vote, since i never opened the product, never hung them at my windows)5 stars based on the fact that it is near impossible to find a 96"" farmhouse curtain that fits a minimalistic decor scheme, for a decent price, and that is of decent quality.I read many reviews on multiple sites and excluding people who received a damaged product, I think one's liking of the curtain entirely depends on one's expectation for the curtain.You're not getting a $200 dollar panel for a good price here. What you are getting is a couple of panels of light and simplistic design that should last a couple of years with intentional care.The off white is not going to be a functional light blocker.I am ordering a second pair. I love the fact that they aren't overload on ruffles and lace.Beautiful curtains. Good quality. I needed an off-white color and couldn�t tell by photos which one would work best. The ivory is a little more yellow than the photos in my opinion and the white is bright white. See my pics for difference between the two colors (different lighting in each photo) . Ivory is on left and white is on the right. Shown with and without the hooks. The white was a little too bright for my decor so I went with ivory (with hooks) but you really can�t go wrong with either!Pro's:","Pro's:

Please note there is a thin film on BOTH SIDES of the acrylic. Please tear it off before use.I absolutely adore these frames and they look stunning. I do wish that the plastic covering was a little bit more sturdy. It scratches really really easily. I'm not sure why it is asking me to create it based on ""warmth"" though?I framed poster print and a characature in two of these frames, placed one above the other. One I gave as a gift. These frames are sturdy, and can be beautiful in a formal or informal setting. Mine are in an entrance hallway next to our guest bath. They look great. The price was a steal too. Highly recommended.I was gifted a print from my favorite artist, but struggled finding a frame in store that would fit. I took a chance and got this one. It isn�t glass, but I don�t mind because it looks great and less chance of breaking during moves. I loved how easy the backing was to manage. 10/10 will be buying more!I bought this to put a signed poster in. Considering what I paid for it ($25) it doesnt feel worth even $10. Extremely flimsy and cheap metal, a misaligned back plate that wasnt cut right, metal clips that consistently pop loose, and no additional support material (for providing a backing or buffer) provided are just a few of its shortcomings. I have half a mind to return it but once you deconstruct the packing to put it together its pretty much impossible to return meaning that you do not find out most of the problems until it is too late.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK (unless its like $7.99 or something).

Way brighter than the OEM lights on my mower. Highly recommended.It took all of about two minutes to swap the old incandescent junk with these new LED's. I swapped them out about three months ago, but really had no reason to use them until tonight. Had a ton of leaves to suck up and it got darker quicker than expected. Turned on the headlights and dang... worked amazingly well. Night and day difference over the stock bulbs.Got stuck mowing as the sun went down a few times this year. Factory lights are basically useless, like trying to hold a candle while mowing the lawn useless. So grabbed these. Easy install, and fit perfectly. Very bright, now the headlights on my mower are actually useful. May drive this thing cross-country now, who knows. Anyway, don't think, just buy them.Bulbs are good and bright. Lens on the end really does focus the light. The only real complaint I had out of the bulbs were that the black plastic that holds the LEDs comes down too far to fit correctly in a factory socket on my 1994 Corvette. I had to trim the sockets to get them to fit and lock into the socket. Small issue though.Unlike the previous LED bulbs I used (and snapped off at the base!), these are VERY bright. I can actually SEE with them! Price is right, good quality, and they WORK.Pro's:","Pro's:

That being said, it doesn�t bother me at all and looks lovely for my purposes.I ordered these in the three different sizes for a gallery wall in my entryway. They look amazing all set together. The frames were good quality and easy to add photos. They came in perfect shape and hung on the wall easily. Happy with the purchase!I received a beautiful birthday card from a friend in Malaysia.

So happy to have my awning back in service :)UPDATE: the seller saw this review and contacted me. They said they will send replacement parts!! Waiting to see if they got my reply of two upper legs that need replacing. So happy that the seller is reading their reviews! Another update to come.����Love this canopy, it is the perfect size for my patio and wasn�t too complicated for two people to put together. It�s not very water resistant, but it doesn�t really claim to be. I needed it mostly for shade. Unfortunately, I didn�t anchor it or weigh it down. We had a strong storm that picked it up and it toppled over, bending one of the legs. I should have taken off the canopy but didn�t realize that the winds would be so strong. I�ve tried to find the manufacturer to get a replacement part but cannot find them. Hoping they will see this review.nanWe loved our gazebo so much. It was pretty easy to assemble and everyone had great comment about how nice it looked in our yard. It protected us from the sun. I really enjoyed sitting outside during the day and not worrying about getting burnt by the sun. Unfortunately, about a week ago, there was a sudden windstorm. We did use the metal anchors that were provided, but the winds came suddenly and fast. Before we knew it the gazebo went down. A few parts have been bent and ruined. I was looking for the manufacture�s information to see if we can get some replacement parts for it but no luck. If anyone here has a phone number or website we can use to find the replacement parts that would be great. I miss my gazebo and being able to sit outside. :-(We absolutely love this gazebo we had a rain storm about a week ago and gazebo remained in the same spot without budging last month we had a tent the tent was pulled up and blown away by the rain storm we had even gusty winds this gazebo stood still in the winds were very highHoping the seller/manufacturer will respond...Good news - it is relatively easy to put up (husband did it all on his own) and it looks great! Stands out among the others in the neighborhood and in my opinion, looks the best. We put this gazebo up because temps are going to be climbing into the 90s this week and the one we had last fall was damaged in a wind storm. One of the reasons we got this brand this time is because it looked easier to take the canopy off for the next windstorm.Unfortunately, a wind gust just lifted this one away and flipped it; damaging three of the support beams and ripping the canopy. We got to enjoy it for a whole 48 hrs. Hoping to get in touch with the manufacturer to request the few replacement parts we need. We were only expecting about 20 mph winds today but it must have funneled through just right.I do recommend this gazebo but would caution that the canopy should be taken down when expecting gusty conditions.Pro's:","Pro's:

Our eco-friendly composite wood frames are made from BonanzaWood from Framerica. A solid material with a very smooth surface. These eco-friendly Bonanza Wood frames provide the finish and look of solid wood at a fraction of the price. About 9 million tons of residual wood each year are collected, cleaned and milled to uniform-size particles. In an automated and computer-controlled process, the combination is formed under intense heat and pressure. Rigid plexiglass front that is durable and shatterproof. Comes with an uninstalled sawtooth hanger. Hangs vertically or horizontallyI purchased these frames for Diamond Paintings. I am very pleased with the quality of the frames. The pictures look wonderful in them. I will definitely continue to purchase these. Price is reasonable. Picture quality, packaged well with bubble wrap and is definitely giftable. Each frame comes with a picture hook that you hammer on.I�m editing my review. The Permanent markings i mentioned were on a protective cover in the plexiglass which was removable. They are quite clear now. My other complaints remain. It does come with brackets but they are not attached to the frames already.These will do, however, three out of the four frames had permanent marking on the plastic covering. Random numbers and letters. Also, the corners just don�t look clean and there�s no brackets on the back to hang the frames.These are cheap, and lightweight.The ""glass"" is a polyethylene, it doesn't show of the picture well and is a dust magnet due to static electricity. I've tried to clean the inside of the frame a couple of times, but I always end up with dust and hair inside the frame. The backing is plain cardboard, and the MDF frame pieces have visible seams in the corners.They do work though, and they look ok as long as you don't get too close.I went with slightly more expensive frames to get quality. That was a mistake with these. The backing is a piece of cardboard, the black laminate is paper and easily peals, the corners are poorly mitered and fall apart even when handling gently. If the other good reviews are truthful, then what is wrong with you people?! They�re $20 a frame! Not worth it AT ALL!The frame is good for large sized art and posters. I would suggest getting mat board or foam core for the back if you want better support for artwork and make it archival. The frame comes with corrugated cardboard to support the back which works fine for posters or art that doesn't need to be archival.Pro's:","Pro's:

Inside of house was 85 degree while out side was 90 degrees. it dropped to 73 in about 15 mins. The wifi option is a plus to control it when you are not home.Our ac broke during the heat wave and I'm so glad we got this. We have a somewhat large open Livingroom/dinning room/kitchen area and it cools the entire place down amazingly. It's slightly loudish, but I don't care. It works. Haven't gotten the electric bill yet, so can't speak on how efficient it is, but so far I'm happySo we recently just purchased this. We just put it in yesterday and we love it! The only thing I could complain about is having to put it together and it took forever to find where to place these panel guides hooks instructions weren't very clear on this. We ended up no using them. So installing it takes a little bit of time. But as for cooling it's great. I downloaded the app and love that too. Being able to turn it off or on and change settings from anywhere is really beneficial to us! A feature we are loving. And I like the look of it. It's not the quietest but not to bad at all especially for its size.I have nothing but good to report. The negative reviews are what I do not understand, maybe the install they did was not quite right? No noise, no mess, no fuss for mine. This unit blows cold air and makes no unusual noise or vibrations. Install took about an hour due to my house having double storm windows, other than that, happy happy happy!Pro's:","Pro's:

I looked for quite a while before I found this one which came with the mat as well which is just what I needed. The antiquing process could�ve been done a little better: looked like a picture of antiquing, not actually distressed paint, but I touched it up just a little with some white paint I had and it looks perfect hanging in my bathroom.

[SELF-EVAPORATION TECHNOLOGY] This air conditioner is designed with self-evaporation technology, so there is no bucket to empty.. [COOL YOUR ROOM] This convenient, portable air conditioning unit provides cool air and dehumidifying for spaces up to 700 square feet. This freestanding fan is ideal for warm weather days or for any room with poor ventilation.Before buying the della air conditioner , i did my research like always. Good and bad review but mostly good. I went with it. I have had it for a month now and am thinking of buying a second one. I am a 66 yr old gramma.. it took no installing at all except putting batteries in the remote and attach the hose in the back and to the window vent, which is included. I did how ever cut the window vent down by six inches, but saved the piece i cut. Fits like a glove. Sit in my living room window which runs into my dining area and kitchen. It has kept us cool and comfortable, the weather has been in the high 90's and 101� for the past several weeks. I emptyed it once, not that it called for it, but we had a cool day and i took advantage of shutting it down to see if i could drain it. It all went off so easy, unbelievable. I have a window one going in the bedroom near by so i leave that door open also. I own a 4 bedroom home i dont expect it to keep the whole house cool so i shut some doors. For this reason i will be purchasing another before the hotter August weather comes. I heard several remarks that it would leak on the floor, so at first i kept an eye on it. It sits on my living room rug not one leak. Also i have rolled it into the kitchen for a few days without any problems hooked it to the window turned it on. I am extremely satisfied.I got the 14K BTU air conditioner. It's 10.5 Max Amps at 115 V so it's max 1.2075 kWh. It runs for 6.5 Min at a time. I have a 650sq foot apartment. It is installed in the living room and I have a 9"" Vornado fan on the floor blowing cold air into my bedroom (ProTip: blow the air through the bottom of the door so the hot air flows out the top of the door).I installed it into my balcony sliding door. My door is 1.5"" think so I bought a 1.5"" think panel of foam insolation panel from the builder supply store and cut a strip to fits perfictaiy in the door gap with a razerblade. I put the cut edge in the door jam and the factory cut edge on the door side so it's flush. I used the included window attachment so I could get the size right up/down, but I scraped grooves into the foam so the plastic window parts slid onto the foam panel and lay flush. Then I taped up the door with blue painters tap because painters tape will not damage anything. Then I wrapped a few layers of tape around the exhaust hose, wrapped a t-shirt around it, and then another few layers of tape so there is no heat leaking form the exhaust hose back into my apartment (aka efficiency).I set it at 70F at night and 72F during the day. When I woke up this morning it was 71F in my bedroom and 81F outside.It is 82F outside now. I have it set at 72F and it runs 4 times an hour for 6.5mins at a time for a total of 26min/hour so it'll cost me about ~$80 a month to run worst case more likely $50 because it's not running at Max Amps all the time (that's likely cranking amps when compressor kicks in) also it cycles far less at night time ~2/hour:> A = 10.5> V = 115> W = A * V> kWh = W / 1000> MinPerHour = 26> MinPerDay = MinPerHour * 24> HourPerDay = MinPerDay / 60> HourPerMonth = * 30> HourPerMonth = HourPerDay * 30> kWhPerMonth = HourPerMonth * kWh> kWhCost = 0.23522> kWhPerMonth * kWhCost[1] 88.61678I love almost everything about it. It does just about everything I need it to and makes the apartment cool and comfortable during the humid summer in Minneapolis.I�d love to give it five stars, however, it is incorrectly advertised (twice) as weighing 20 pounds. The tech that goes into these units has improved a lot over the years, but it has not lightened up THAT much. If you�re thinking of buying one and there is no elevator where you live then just be aware that this unit actually weighs more than 80 pounds and getting it to your home might be a two-person job. If that info is fixed, then I will gladly update my review with five stars.I did a lot of research before deciding on this unit. The dimensions were important -- I did not want something that would overwhelm the living room but energy efficiency and noise were just as important. I was leery of a brand I had never heard of but the reviews convinced me it was worth a try and I am very glad I did. It feels well made and is really quiet. I live in an apartment building and didn't want to have to raise TV volume to compensate for and I don't. I didn't think the specs were well written. I couldn't find a decibal or EER rating and was not sure if the air conditioner was self-evaporative or not. I found recently while reading an answer to a question that it is and the tube is mainly for the dehumidifier. That was a relief. I can't say anything about the energy cost since the weather has not warranted a lot of use yet, but I searched on this and the manuafacturer's site for an EER rating without success. I contacted them by phone after I had placed the order to ask about the return policy and country of origin but had to leave a message that was never answered. But all in all, I am very glad I bought this unit. So far, so good.This unit definitely does not cool at the 14,000 BTUs advertised. I recently moved into a house that does not have central AC. I bought 3 different units from different manufactures to see which I thought was the best. I bought the Della 14,000 BTU unit, a Black and Decker 10,000 BTU unit, and an 8,000 unit from Honeywell.The Black and Decker is by the best at cooling a large den. The Della and the Honeywell cool about equally which is disappointing as the Della is supposed to cool almost twice as well as the Honeywell.Very disappointed in this product and would not buy again.Pro's:","Pro's:

Collage Potential: With the included mat, this frame can display up to 9 individual 4x4 inch pictures. Each opening size is 3.5x3.5 inches. You can also use the frame without the mat to display one 16x16 inch photo. Features: Aluminum Metal Frame, Acid Free Bevel Cut Mat, Attached Glass Panel, Sawtooth Hangers, Swivel Tabs. Simple and Elegant: This classic modern frame is perfect for framing any and all of your photos. If you love inspirational saying or phrases, this frame can hold all of your whimsical musesI gave this to my daughter with a progressive series of photos of the same building over many years. It was a huge hit for both the idea behind it and the beautiful yet simple qppearance. She absolutely LOVED it!I only bought this because of the picture of the pineapple. I thought that the way the frame broke it up was cool. But, the picture that came with the frame when it was delivered was not of the pineapple. I immediately sent it back.I bought this frame for a lithograph that was this size. It looks actually more beautiful framed in this wonderful frame. I don't think you will be disappointed in any side. The back of the frame was a delight to take advantage of the features & made it SO easy to put together. I had it framed in a snap!This frame was purchased to replace a very old, too-big collage frame that was falling apart. The new frame is attractive, well-packaged, and easy to disassemble/reassemble with pictures in place. It has hangers on the back (no easel) to hang vertically or horizontally. Unfortunately, I discovered damage on one corner after I had opened it and begun adding my photos. The corner was dented and separated at the mitered seam. It had to have happened at the manufacturer, because the frame had paper corner protectors on it, was shrink-wrapped over those, had thick foam corner protectors over the shrink wrap, then was tightly boxed. I didn't inspect it carefully because it was packaged so well. I'll still hang it but am pretty disappointed. I'm glad I hadn't sent it directly from Amazon to someone else as a gift.I have an antique valentine that belonged to my grandmother (I believe she received it in the 190s). It's a three panel card, with ribbon connecting each of the panels. I removed the three-photo matting and attached a soft printed fabric to the cardboard panel. It looks spectacular, and I know it will hold up for a long time. (My previous frame broke.)Pro's:","Pro's:

The posters look like a professional framed them!Such a great value for the quality! These frames are the perfect addition to our house and look really nice. The installation pieces that come with the frames are super helpful too!I ordered these frames because wing made of solid wood they seemed like a good value given the price. Well, they are made of wood alright, so the manufacturer isn�t lying about that. How solid they are is another question. The wood used to make these frames is like a half a step above balsa wood. As I unpacked them I felt I had to treat them with kid gloves or they�d fall apart right there in my hands. The manufacturer literally sends each frame (I purchased a three-pack) with a small plastic item to repair corners that have come apart. You can scratch through the paint and hit raw wood with a fingernail. One of my three frames actually came scratched right from the manufacturer. I opted to touch it up myself rather than go through the hassle of a return and subsequent wait for a replacement. Opening the frames to insert my artwork was fairly straight forward. Everything fit as it was supposed to. I managed to get all three up on the wall without damaging them, and they do look nice, but I doubt I�ll order these again. I think I�ll opt for something more sturdily put together.Glad I got the white frames. Really makes these colorful posters pop!UPDATE: The seller reached out, apologized and insisted on giving me a refund. While it was not necessary as I still did use the product, it was very professional and appreciated -- I was assured future products would be triple checked (which was really the only outcome I needed). If you receive it totally in tact, it is a fine set of three frames for what you pay for.PREVIOUS: Absolutely terrible. I understand you get what you pay for, but a chunk broke off and splintered into my palm.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Comes with Regular Glass and a sawtooth hanger for wall mounting. Made of MDF - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it. For other colors and non-standard sizes in this frame style search '2WOMFRBW26079-4x4' on amazon.com. Fits 16x16 inch Photos! Actual Frame size (finished size) is 18x18 inches and is 1.25 inches wide.. This black satin frame is our favorite gallery frame, this is our most versatile frame, photographs, posters, prints, diploma's and certificates look amazing in this smooth and sophisticated frameThis is a piece of junk. It says it comes with plexi glass. Plexi glass comes in various widths. Perhaps I was being overly optimistic but based on the price point and reviews my expectation is that it would be a thick piece of plastic resembling the thickness and hardness of the glass that comes on usual picture frames, or at least a thick enough piece of plastic to be easy to get it in and out of the frame to put my poster in and to give the piece a nice, smooth surface appearance. Boy was I wrong. The plexi glass is a thin sheet of flimsy, wobbly plastic with irregularities in it. Now that I have the piece together and hanging on my wall you can tell the plastic is bowing out and it isn't smooth and dust clings to it. The back is just a piece of regular packing cardboard and because the plastic is flimsy it doesn't securely sandwich the poster against the soft cardboard back, so there are little dips and wrinkles in the poster that are highly visible under the plastic. The frame itself is compressed paper with a faux wood finish on it that was already peeling off slightly in one corner when I received it. For not much more money I could have obtained a real wood frame with real glass from another company on Amazon.The original plan was to use this to house an irregularly shaped vintage map I had purchased at a market, and then to take it to a frame shop to have the framer cut a mat to fit the piece into the frame. The framing guy practically laughed at me when I brought this in. He said he couldn't do it because the quality of the frame was so poor and there was no way to affix paper or any kind of backing to the frame once it was finished. The mat would have cost $40, and he was willing to do a full professional frame job with a wooden frame and real glass and a mat for $120, so for only $40 more than the cost of this frame plus a mat. And I wasn't thrilled about leaving a civil war era map of Virginia with no protection other than flimsy plexi glass. So I paid the framer to do the whole job and figured I'd return this frame, but then finding a box to return it was a pain, so ultimately I went online and bought a poster that fits the frame and hung it in my office at work. It looks like crap.The packaging is marked Glass - there is no glass. This frame comes with plexiglass, which had scratches. The description says MDF, but also Wood. I took this to mean it was shaped MDF to resemble the grooms and texture of wood, like other frames I have that do this. It is not - it is MDF with a sticker wrapped around it printed with a wood pattern. It is a flat, very obviously cheap looking design. I had to request a return, which was approved, however I must pay the shipping. Based upon the size of the box, I am guessing the shipping will make the refund moot.There is nothing positive to say about this frame. You'd be better off saving your money and purchasing a poster frame for a fraction of the price.I've purchased this frame twice in the past couple of years and have been happy every time. The first purchase was for a very straightforward reason - I couldn't find a 12x24 frame anywhere locally. So I did a little research, found this frame on Amazon and (best of all!) the artwork fit perfectly! So when I needed another 12x24 frame... guess what came to mind? Another well built frame that perfectly complements my artwork. And best of all, despite being purchased over a year apart, the two frames looked perfect next to each other! Great quality and durable to boot... this frame is perfect for your artwork.I bought two 24x24 frames with custom mats to frame two 20x20 poster prints. Great quality for what you pay for (and remember what you paid. You aren�t buying expensive frames!) once framed, the wall art looks much more expensive and doesn�t look like basic posters. They are light so I imagine they will be easy to hang. Yes the hardware to hang the frames aren�t installed on the frame, but they are provided and aren�t hard to install. (It's not rocket science and won�t be my first time putting hardware on a frame.) they provide instructions to install the hardware. I will be opting out on the hardware provided and will purchase sawtooth hangers from Michael�s as I�ve found it�s easier to hang for me and level especially since I will be hanging them side to side (so happy not installed as it gave me the option to switch how to hang them up.) again so light due to the mdf frame so sawtooth hangers should work great, looks expensive for what paid for ( I paid less than $140 for both prints, frames and mats for 2� x 4� of art!) and can�t wait to hang them up!This came packaged with care. I didn�t have any frontal scratches and fit what I actually needed to frame. Easy to put together and hardware is included. I plan on rebuying another one for another painting and I can reuse the box it came in to send off. The way they have boxed the frame is perfect for gifting, IMO.Pro's:","Pro's:

I'm so happy that I did. This is easily the best tasting protein powder I have ever used and it mixes in well and doesn't leave any clumps like some others I have tried in the past. I'm pleasantly surprised and look forward to trying out some of the other flavors in the future.I absolutely love the cake pop flavor for my protein pancakes! They taste absolutely amazing. Couldn�t be happier :�)For my pancakes I use:-1 scoop cake pop protein powder-2 eggs-pinch of salt-dollop of milk (I use cashew milk)-1/2 tsp baking powder-1/4 cup old fashioned oats-blueberries to my heart�s content :-)I have purchased this product over 4-5 times. Previously, I would read other reviews and roll the dice on something "" bigger and better"". And each time I come groveling back , hat in hand on bended knee. Simply put , this is the best tasting , most potent protein I have encountered. Mind you, I am a 52 year old black man who has been lifting on and off ever since I saw Tom Platz on a magazine cover in 1983. I go back to the days of bee pollen and dried liver tablets. So I know a thing or two about eating for function and not taste. Comparing Select protein ( snickerdoodle) to the products back in the day is like comparing The Little Sisters of the Poor to the Klan. I know...a bit dramatic but you get the point. It is nice to actually look forward to your morning shake folks. You can get creative and add it to complete pancake mix. Add a little extra water and you will be a hit at breakfast again. Try this stuff and prepare for the adulation of the cheering crowd roaring your name in utter benevolence rising to a crescendo of............ Sorry, I'm back now. It is.really good stuff.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Polyester. 2 person, 32 square foot lightweight tent ideal for backpacking or camping; includes seam taped, full coverage weatherproof rain fly. Durable, 7000 series aluminum poles. Dual d shaped doors for easy Access; dual overhead vestibules for extra storage space. Floor dimensions: 50 x 88 inches; interior height: 43 inches; trail weight: 4 pounds, 13 ounce; pack weight: 5 pounds, 5 ounce; floor space: 32 square feetI took this tent across the Grand Canyon from the North rim to the South rim. The tent was great on the north rim when the temp got down to 40 F. What really saved me was the rain fly + footprint ""lite"" setup in Bright Angel campground where the night temp barely got to 88 F, the Canyon walls really hold the heat.Setup was very easy by myself with the poles being secured together on a swinging couplet. This is a true freestanding tent and light enough for a single person to justify carrying for a multi-day trip.Make sure you get the footprint as well! It's not included with the tent.This is a great backpacking tent; I got the footprint, too, which isn't included in the price (it provides good tent tub protection and is virtually weightless). The tent itself is wonderful for one person; snug for two but acceptable. Without the rain fly the tent is 100% well-ventilated and great for stargazing at night. With the fly on, the change in ventilation is huge, but it works well in common rainstorms (it goes on and off in a snap).There are two small pockets inside the tent, along the tub, for phone storage, etc. (also available on Amazon is an MSR Tent Gear Loft for use inside the tent. Its a nice addition to the tent interior and is virtually weightless). Overall, I love this tent and think the value to cost ratio is good. Without the rain fly its actually super light (the rain fly adds a full pound).TLDR: Expect to replace the stakes with something better. It doesn't come with enough to be functional. Expect to buy guy line tensioners and make your own guy lines. Expect to make your own ground sheet. Expect to spend at least $50 more after your purchase to have a proper, usable light tent. Expect the tent to weigh around 5lbs when ready for the trail. Aside from that, it's well designed and very well constructed. See update at the end.Long Review:I have been buying and using tents for a long time. While there are many good things here, let's cover the bad first.The listing for this tent is wrong about the weight and fails to mention that it is missing accessories which must be bought before the tent is ready to go on a real hike. The kit weighs 4 lbs, 5.6 oz as I received it. That's almost a whole pound heavier than the listed weight. Cut off all tags and chunk the plastic trash in the package and you shave maybe an ounce. But it gets worse. Once you get enough stakes and guy lines set up to make it functional, it will weigh more, and that's still without a ground sheet. Listed as 3lbs, 8 oz, you'll be looking realistically at 5+ lbs in the end with a ground sheet and at least 4.4lbs without. Still not bad for the size, but why lie about it?There are only 6 decent aluminum shepherd's hook stakes included when 12 are required to properly stake everything out. Even the cheapest tents come with enough stakes for any configuration and usually with one or two to spare. There are stakes for the tent corners and the two points of the vestibules, but none for 4 guy lines or for the middles of the 2 ends of the fly. This will add around $10-$40 and probably 3-5 ounces. I am replacing all of the stakes with MSR groundhog minis, around $33 for 12. This is a good balance in the price/weight/usefulness spectrum. Add something like that to the listed price for reference. This is terrible customer service from Marmot for a product which they list at $299 on the tag in the package. (I paid $150, normal amazon price is $200.)There are no guy lines on the tent, but rather a hank of 4 guy line cords rolled up in the stake bag with 2 plastic guy line tensioners. 2 tensioners will get you ventilation, but you need 4 to 6 to guy out for storm or wind. So you can also expect to buy yourself a set of guy line tensioners. I decided to go with an ultralight kit which includes extras and a length of ultralight dynema-and-something cordage for around $16 in order to keep the weight reasonable.In order to fit the guy line string in the stake bag, they made the stake bag massively oversized, meaning true ultralighters need to make a new stake bag or go without one. This is disappointing from a tent with so much attention to weight in every detail of its construction.Now let's talk about the good:The tent itself is designed well. The main poles are connected at the apex with a swivel-thing. It makes it easier to assemble, harder to get things tangled, and adds a tiny bit of weight. I'm not sure if I like it yet. I could do without it, but it may add stability to the tent. There is a ""spreader"" pole with 2 sections which widens the roof of the tent at the top. This is very nice, and gives a bit more headroom by fully stretching the material and creating extra volume inside. The poles clip to the tent with nice, ultralight clips. They are aluminum and light, but not too fragile. There is a pole splint sleeve in the stake bag for temporary fixes to the poles. I broke a pole at the joints and had to fix it with another method.The corners of the tent have simple metal grommets for the poles and simple, light cordage loops for stakes and rainfly attachments. The ultralight mindset really shows here, but everything is sturdy as well.The tent body is mostly mesh. It is a fine mesh which feels more like looking through a pair of pantyhose than looking through the mesh of cheaper tents. It makes things look a bit blurry and doesn't offer quite the same visuals as looking out of a cheaper tent. I'm OK with this. The material seems lighter and sturdy enough.The doors are large and very well designed. The zippers seem to end early for weight savings, preventing the door from opening fully when unzipped (though they open adequately this way), but the doors stretch open wider when locked into the ultralight holders, leaving tons of room to work with, and they zip very easily.The side walls are nearly vertical and the end walls have only a minor slope for the first 12 inches, making it very roomy inside considering the dimensions. It is easy to sit up, move around, sit on your knees, or change clothes inside.The floor is thin but sturdy enough if you use a ground sheet. The seams are all well sealed. It has 4 small seams, one at each corner, for reinforcement. The floor is not a bathtub style, but has a seam around the entire edge as well. This seems fine and the stitching all over the tent seems great.There is a plastic clip/ring thing hanging from the apex of the inside to hang lights or other things from. There is also a small, opaque white triangular pocket near the apex which can be used for small gear or a headlight. The white color acts as a diffuser, turning the headlamp into a lantern. I love this, but I bring my own ultralight diffuser for a microstream USB. This is the only portion of the tent which isn't transparent mesh other than a 6-inch section around the base.There are also 4 loops around the tent ceiling which can be used for hanging a gear loft. Weirdly, the tent does not come with a loft and I don't think one is available for it, but you could make one if you like.There are 2 small gear pockets inside. They are well designed and they will rest partly on the ground instead of causing the tent walls to sag, which is awesome. They are just large enough for a large phone and some other bits of small gear.The tent is perfect for one hiker plus gear. It can hold two with only the most necessary gear in an emergency. For a couple, the rainfly would always be needed to store gear in vestibules. I'm 5'8 and have plenty of room beneath my feet for gear when laying down, plus ample room along my side for spreading wet things to dry and spreading out phones/drinks/snacks, etc while sleeping.The rain fly is also very nice. The color is nice while in the tent with it on. It has 2 vestibules, one larger than the other. I like this, as it saves weight and only one large vestibule is needed. It only looks slightly lopsided when set up.The fly door Velcro and zippers are great, and the holders for the flap are ultralight and nicely made.There is one ventilation hole at the top of the fly which has a Velcro closure and a small built-in pole for holding it open. It works great, but is not large. The fly also ends a few inches above the ground in order to improve ventilation, which I believe will work nicely and still block rain when staked out properly.There are two places for small guy lines at the middles of the ends, which holds the fly away from the body to help in rain and improve ventilation. There are also 4 loops for guy lines along the corners of the fly. These seem sturdy but light.Overall I love the design of the tent and the ultralight mindset used in the details of its construction. I think it will serve me well for a long time, but I am disappointed in Marmot for shady amazon listings and for the lack of needed accessories in the package. They could and should do better as a company. I'm sure their only excuse for not including these things is to make the tent's weight closer to the imaginary weight on this amazon listing. If they want to lie about it, why bother also skimping on the required extra bits? Stop lying to us, Marmot.If you don't mind spending extra money and making your own extras, it's a 5-star item.update: This tent was destroyed. I survived Hurricane Laura and the eye came right over my house. I spent two weeks living in this tent afterward because it was more comfortable and bug-free than trying to stay in a sweltering house without electricity and full of mosquitos. The tent worked great through most of this, but one of the main poles mysteriously got broken while I was away from home one day. I was able to make it work with some bailing wire and duct tape to reinforce the broken area of the pole, but I was a bit disappointed with this.After this, I went to Colorado for a few weeks to get away from the Fallout universe which my neighborhood had become. I had no plans nor friends in the area, only traveled around various mountains and camped wherever I could drop the tent. It worked great for a while, but I had to travel with my dogs as well, as this was not a camping trip, but a refugee trip. Eventually, my anxious Pitt ripped his way out of the tent when I had walked away to use the bathroom and ruined it fully. Thankfully, there were no bugs in the Colorado mountains and I was able to stay for the rest of the trip comfortably enough, but it would take some major repairs to fix the massive rips in the material of this tent, and considering the state of the poles, it's just not worth it anymore. I have not touched this tent since coming home from that trip.This was my dream hiking tent. I'm disappointed that it got torn up, but it's not the end of the world. It served me well and got me through some very rough times in much more comfort than many had at the time. I am currently saving up to buy another or something very similar to this. Overall, I would buy again. I recommend it, but it isn't a good dog kennel.Yes! This tent exceeded expectations!It is small and light without cutting corners but still being quality and functioning well.My husband and I use this tent for backpacking trips for just the two of us (we have an Alps mountaineering for when we bring the kids) and it is a great little tent. It is roomy enough for us to sleep comfortably on our own mats and has all the basic bells and whistles such as side pockets and lantern loops. I love that the actual tent is mostly screen (sometimes we sleep in this in our back yard on hot nights and what a view!) and the rain fly has the �vestibule� space on both sides for storing shoes or packs and also reaches to within an inch or so of the ground to keep out the rain and cold nights.The floor seems to be normal tent fabric and is not reinforced so you will want to get a �footprint�. We use a heat-reflecting ground tarp that is slightly thicker than a footprint but slightly smaller than the tent floor and it works fine.Zippers are dependable and quality. Stakes are very light and they supply plenty of guy lines but we usually don�t take them all-maybe 4-6 stakes and 2 guy lines.The tent is really easy to put up-everything is color coded. I worry about the form-bent poles but we are just very careful with them and they seem sturdy enough.I love the green color so we can blend into the forest a bit.We have used this tent on 2 trips (and several backyard �excursions�) and are very satisfied with it.

HIGH-QUALITY DESIGN � The Olympic Weights Plate from Steelbody features a dense construction that�s to resist disintegration over time. The compact structure helps minimize fractures caused by high-impact drops.. PERFECT FOR HOME AND GYM USE � Suitable for fitness beginners and gym buffs, this plate allows you to train your way to more muscular physique in the conducive environment of a gym or in the comfort of your home.This Olympic plate came quickly and weighed at least 10 pounds. Pro tip, if you leave it inside the packaging it weighs a little bit more, so you can build that muscle mass even faster. I've picked it up and put it down a number of times now, I'm sure I'll be shredded very soon. Look out Stallone, I'm coming for your movie parts. The rubberized coating on the plate is very helpful for keeping the noise of the weight down when in rattles around inside the box. My friends keep telling me to take it out of the box and use a bar, but that seems difficult. All in all, I'd say this is a very weighty weight, and I can't wait to use it some more. Now, where do I get the steroids?***************************UPDATE: I have now taken the weight out of the box, and put it on a bar. It's quite difficult to use since I only bought one weight, I highly recommend everyone else buy 2.UPDATE 2: This is a joke, obviously. I bought this weight as a replacement. It works, quality seems good. STEROIDS!!!The 10 pound plates are the absolute WORST I have ever used. I have two of them on my trap bar and they folded over like a piece of paper. These things are totally worthless as stand alones. Go to Sportsmith and get your 10 pound bumper plates. They are strong and hold up extremely well. These things must be made out of Silly putty. What a disgrace to sell these pieces of garbage.The dead-lift pull is getting heavier and didn't want to crack the concrete floor under the mat in the home gym. Great product, made very well!I was a bit irritated at this seller however. I needed and wanted to purchase 4, the limit to purchase per customer is three. Three? Who only needs three? There are two sides to a bar bell and each side needs equal weight. ?? Only three.. Pfft! The product is really great though.I really have no reason not give these 5 stars. I bought 2 of them, which originally I planned to buy 4 but they only allowed 3 at a time so I ended up buying 2 more 15s instead. But these are very durable. I use them on the standard Olympic barbell by themselves and have not been overly gentle with them and they�ve lasted so far. Haven�t bent or anything. Before I bought the 15s I was also adding up to 10lb steal plates to the end and they still held up. Would definitely recommend these if you�re planning to use them on their own. Otherwise it�s possible there might be cheaper but flimsier options if you just want to use them to add on.Product arrived quickly and in good shape. I was worried about the flimsiness mentioned by other people, but mine are fine, they do not bend. I took them out of the packaging, and left them on my smith cage machine in the garage, so the rubber tire smell went away in few days. These bumper weight plates are great for my Crossfit training, deadlift, squat clean, snatch and etc.... you can do many exercises with them. Good price too, I would recommend them to the others.Pro's:","Pro's:

Next time it needs to be thicker. For 180 density, it should be thicker. This feels more like 130 or 140. Is every body getting short of hair or something.

They swivel, they include 2 height options (not found anywhere else) and they are easy to assemble (I did it by myself)!Important, too, is the customer care this seller, FurniMate, provides. It is amazing! My set arrived with one leg missing an end cap and another leg having a damaged end cap. When I let him know, 5 days later a package with replacement parts plus a few just-in-case extras, was sitting on my doorstep. He checked in, checked up, and sent updates before, during and after the whole process, and was courteous and truly concerned with my complete satisfaction; very refreshing after hearing so much to the contrary about some companies.I liked the bar stools so much I ordered another set. They arrived quickly and were completely intact. Again, the seller promptly addressed my question about a price change in the weeks between my original and 2nd purchase.I am happy with these bar stools, enjoy using them, (if I ever want to change the seat color in the future, a circle of fabric and a staple gun will do the trick), and feel great about the many ways FurniMate showed me their commitment to fantastic customer care.love these bar stools and as you see in the photo they look really nice and sharp.my only concern is that the material used is not very sturdy and may need to be replaced at some point.seems easy to do so. I will enjoy them now and replace the cushion cover at some point.I do love them!These are comfortable and cushy and the swivel feature facilitates sit to stand without moving the stool out. No scuffs on the floor and the seat covering has a look and feel of well-worn leather. Recommend assembling with 2 people if possible.These stools are super comfortable and feels super solid. The color of the fabric was just what I was looking for! It�s a soft touch fabric that looks like leather.I bought this bc if swiveled and my grandparents had similar stools growing up. Easy to put together, I was worried about a little wobble and the tightness of the swivel but when sitting, it swivels just the right amount and the wobble went away. I set this one up as counter stool. It comes with 2 different leg extensions for either counter height or bar height. The microfiber seat cover has the right amount of dark to light faux leather feel. If you want fancy stools this isn�t it.

We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee on all of our products, and take great pride in offering fun, high quality gift ideas for your home and decor needs!I was able to put my daughter's picture she showed at the fair directly in since it had to be glued on matte board and I didn't want to waste the cost of the picture and board and not hang the picture without protecting it. The picture was an 8x10 and the matte was an 1"" border on top and sides with a longer border on the bottom with you can hardly tell.The frame worked beautifully! It would be nice if it were also offered with matt glass. Where I have it hanging, I get glare and reflections from a nearby window. Would be less with matt glass. Just saying! :-) Otherwise, great quality, great packaging, and looks awesome.This frame seems well made and looks great. The matte is a bright white and nice in itself but I wish it was a softer white or maybe a very light tan or cream color but I am pleased with it overall.This is a high quality frame for a very reasonable price. Well packed for shipping in double box. Real glass. Even the sample photo of Amsterdam it is matted with is pretty enough to use.St what i needed / TxPro's:","Pro's:

Our Frames Come Complete with UV Resistant Acrylic Front, Acid Free Foam Board Backing, and Hanging Hardware.. Wall Hanging Hardware Included for Easy Installation. Frame can be displayed vertically or horizontally.?. Proudly Custom Made to Order in the USA!These frames look super fake up close and the corners aren't mated up well. And despite the awesome packaging (cardboard bumpers everywhere) there were still several small scratches where the material below was exposed, which makes me think the paint can come off super easily. Not even worth the money.This frame works for what I needed size wise, but for the quality, I'd expect it to be half the price or less. It's made of plastic, not glass, and does not have a hook for hanging at all. Still haven't figured out how to hang it up.Extremely well packaged, beautiful frame arrived early. VERY pleased to have found this odd size at such a good price and it's nicer than I anticipated!Very good frame. Glad I could find one for an 11x15� size� apparently it�s not a common size. Fits an illustration I made for someone just right!Exactly as described and exceeded my expectations with how modern they look! For a custom size you can�t beat it, plus their website has tons more options and dimensions. Definitely going to be ordering more of these to match this one.Pro's:","Pro's:

Multiple water return options for optimal versatility to best suite a variety of aquarium habitats; spray bar, water director and water polishing unit.

Internal media replacement; carbon change every 30 days, foam pad rinse or replace as needed, white polishing pad change as needed. Includes quick disconnect valves, pump locking heads, water intake/output connections, hoses, water polishing unit with cartridge and media: activated carbon, coarse foam, bio-balls, bio-ceramic rings. Fits aquarium size up to 75 gallonsMy son inherited a red eared slider, Bob. At 8 years old I thought, this is a great way to teach him ongoing responsibility.I was so right!He has worked hard and saved up his money to make various upgrades to Bob's lifestyle, including this Deluxe filter.So far so good. And bonus, cleaning it and water changes are pretty easy too.This canister filter is very quiet and it was easy to set up. It contains a variety of media inside the canister to give you a robust bacterial colony for your cycle and it keeps my axolotl tank very clean. I combined this with a sponge filter to provide additional surface for the bacteria and oxygenation of the tank. Axolotls are super dirty so I definitely recommend a canister filter on any tank over 29 gals. I had never used a canister filter before this so I was definitely a newbie but we figured it out without too much issue and it's been very reliable so far.The reviews read it was quiet. I have my tank in the living room. It is not all that quiet. Its about as loud as the hum of an old worn out refridgerator. If I had to sleep on the couch, ""LOL"" it would keep me awake all night. I'm going to keep it though. Not worth the trouble of unhooking and returning. Just lean to tune it out. Other than that, it works great so far. The only addition to it that I recommend, is to add a fine filter ""water conditioner"" sponge somewhere. I added it in the water return spillway. There is a filter cloth there already, but it is not adequate for fine matter filtering. This made an almost instant difference in the water clarity. I had some fine dust/dirt that was not quite rinsed off that clouded the water. By the way, I'm running it in a 75 gal. tank. Its a new setup with all live plants, thats why you don't see any fish yet.I bought this product for my 55 gallon tank that houses two goldfish. This replaces one of the Aqueon 110 gallon HOB filters( good filter but they dont last long). I will be replaceing the other Aqueon with this canister filter. It is quiet and cleared the water soon after installation.This gave back a lot of room in the aquarium compared to the back hanging filter. It dramatically reduced the maintenance required. And it is far quieter than my previous ""whisper"" product.The quality of the product seems high and I've cleaned the cannister once. Easy.Pro's:","Pro's:

Please note there is a thin film on BOTH SIDES of the acrylic. Please tear it off before use.I absolutely adore these frames and they look stunning. I do wish that the plastic covering was a little bit more sturdy. It scratches really really easily. I'm not sure why it is asking me to create it based on ""warmth"" though?I framed poster print and a characature in two of these frames, placed one above the other. One I gave as a gift. These frames are sturdy, and can be beautiful in a formal or informal setting. Mine are in an entrance hallway next to our guest bath. They look great. The price was a steal too. Highly recommended.I was gifted a print from my favorite artist, but struggled finding a frame in store that would fit. I took a chance and got this one. It isn�t glass, but I don�t mind because it looks great and less chance of breaking during moves. I loved how easy the backing was to manage. 10/10 will be buying more!I bought this to put a signed poster in. Considering what I paid for it ($25) it doesnt feel worth even $10. Extremely flimsy and cheap metal, a misaligned back plate that wasnt cut right, metal clips that consistently pop loose, and no additional support material (for providing a backing or buffer) provided are just a few of its shortcomings. I have half a mind to return it but once you deconstruct the packing to put it together its pretty much impossible to return meaning that you do not find out most of the problems until it is too late.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK (unless its like $7.99 or something). You can do better.The frame is perfect.Pro's:","Pro's:

If customers have any quality problems during assembly and use, please feel free to contact us. We will reply and solve them soon. Note: The stock of gazebo top replacement is available in our store.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and sturdiness of the frame. The instructions recommend 2 people but it was easy enough for this senior citizen to assemble solo. The domed top seems to make all the difference as it has not sagged in the rain and we've had some downpours. The shape of the dome seems to also resist lifting in the wind. I've purchased cheaper types of gazebos that didn't survive the summer but this one is by far the most heavy duty. I also thought the legs were ""bent"" but it's actually a neat feature. A bow legged gazebo makes the inside feel more spacious.Bought this after the snow caved in our old one (oops). I was able to put the entire thing together myself (30+ y/o female). I couldn�t tell you how long it took because I was just kinda going at my own pace, enjoying being outside on a nice summer day, taking breaks here and there.There were times I thought I would definitely need a 2nd person, but I figured it out and got everything done myself. Some screws were mislabeled so I had a couple heart attacks thinking I didn�t get the right pieces, but everything was there.We put weighted bags on the corners and it has survived some pretty gnarly wind storms with no issues.10/10 recommended!Honestly, I didn't expect much from this based on the price, but it's been great. I've only had it up for one summer so far but it held up to the elements great, it's surprisingly sturdy for the price and how many pieces it's made out of. My only complaint is that the bug screen at the peak doesn't have any way of attaching to the main cover so it just sort of blows around and doesn't do a good job keeping bugs/debris out of the top.I haven't disassembled it since I bought it, because the yard is still in good shape. I was impatient to open it and check the quality inside. The quality of the shed is really good. Block the sun's rays. I will go ahead and buy a second one.Great outdoor canopy!! The setup instructions was easy to understand and put together, it literary took me and my wife less than two hours to set everything up. The material is also very durable, we had a few rain storms already and had absolutely no issues with it. The design and durability of this product is definitely worth it's money.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Oxford Polyester. Imported. This is NOT a automatic pop up tent that need to be built by hand, suitable for customers who are good at hands-on ability, folding support rod, small package volume, easy to carry and storage for self-drive travel, BUT please install carefully according to the installation drawings and instrucitons, be sure to fix the stakes & wind ropes step by step, it will be more stable than automatic tent.Please DO NOT choose this tent if you want to build quickly in 60S.. Large space:Inside dimension14.1ft length*10ft width*6.58ft height, fit 4 full air mattresses(6.7ft*5ft/200cm*150cm),can accommodate 10~12 person,3 doors with mesh,3 Windows with mesh,divided into two rooms by separation curtain.. Materials:Waterproof Oxford Polyester, High density mesh.. Unique design: straight wall design, interior space is larger and more comfortable. If the door curtain supports by two poles, it becomes a sunshade canopy. The top of the tent is high density mesh, very breathable, we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sky when lying inside.. KTT Camping tent not only focus on the quality, but also pay attention to its practicality. We add 2 poles for the door curtain, it can immediately become an awning tent, family members can take a rest inside, also can play outside under the awning. Although it raises the cost, it brings you pleasure.LEAKS! LEAKS! LEAKS! And NOT a little! Try massive pools of water all over the floor. EVERY seam and zipper leaked. And this was after we used 6 cans of waterproofer on it before using it. The zipper fabric was shredding after 3 days and the zippers were all getting stuck and breaking! This tent was a TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!! And we thought it had that canopy at one entrance...it is NOT a canopy. Its the WINDOW cover!! SO it was really fun having to pull that down EVERY TIME it sprinkled. Someone mentioned in another review that the pockets (inside) leaked... THEY DO!! And all our air mattresses/ pillows and stuff were DRENCHED!!!! The only thing that saved us was the fact our sleeping bags were mostly waterproof. I do NOT recommend this tent. We are returning it...anything that leaks that much needs a WARNING label on it!While the fabric might be water resistant, the zippers are not which let's water slowly leak in. We got caught in a rain storm in the PNW and thought we were safe but upon waking we noticed water under our mattresses. Feeling around for holes we noticed droplets from the zipper area, super frustrating to deal with with 3 toddlers.Light weight and very manageable. Spacious room and glad we bought this for our family. Love this text.This tent is so cool and huge! My boyfriend and I used it for a camping trip over the summer and it was perfect. I'm used to staying in a camper so I wanted to feel like I was glamping a bit lol and this was perfect. There's plenty of room for a queen size mattress in each room with room to spare. We only used one mattress and the rest was used for hangout space. It's perfect if you have animals because they have room to walk around. Also, it was super easy to put up. Took us 30 minutes or less! It's worth the purchase! Highly suggest it!=]I am very happy with this tent! We purchased the tent a few months ago and have used it 3 times. You can lay in bed and stair up at the stars! It is the best tent I have purchased!Pro's:","Pro's:

Material: Wood frame with a polished tempered shatter-resistant glass front that gives a clear view of your picture. Quality: Durable, gallery-style frame; the frame's front has clear tempered shatter-resistant glass and a sturdy backboard to keep the photo in place.

Protective Packaging: Americanflat developed exclusive proprietary packaging that helps ensure safe delivery of fragile items; order with confidence, click and add to cart todayAccording to some folks, the supplier changed from sawtooth hangers to wire hangers somewhere along the way, and they aren't happy about it.However, I purposely purchased these because they come with wire, rather than cheap sawtooth hangers found everywhere else. I consider this an upgrade. You cannot purchase wire hanging frames of this quality at this price point anywhere that I have found. As a professional photographer needing good quality, glass front, wire hung frames for certain presentations, these are fantastic.The clips slip over the backer board, and you slide them to whatever height you find appropriate (usually a few inches down from the top). Run the wire through one clip with an inch or two of excess and twist like a bread bag tie to secure. Run over to the other clip and cut the wire to appropriate length, again with a bit extra for twisting. That's it!The clips sometimes are a tad loose and might slide on the backer, so just give them a squeeze before applying. This is something I do by default as a matter of safety anyway. ""Trust no one"".I give these 5 stars. I considered docking a half star because the wire is more like green floral wire - it's quite stiff and a bit difficult to work with. It's not a true, flexible, braided picture wire. But again at this price point and quality I'm not going to quibble.Great frame that is sturdy and worth the price. I comfortably framed an entire Time Magazine within the frame without problems. It has held up well and I look forward to purchasing more of these frames.The rest of this is in response to other review of the frames. They state that they are being mislead with the ""ready-to-hang"" title. The frames are still ""Ready-to-hang."" The previous sawtooth hanging methods are ugly and unusable in a gallery setting. The wire system is easy to use and is what normal people will use to hang their work.Other people are disappointed that the wire isn't installed to frame... which is just mental because they're allowing you to choose to do a vertical or horizontal framing. Just twist the wire and slip it on. It's so easy! You already have to take the frame backing off to put your ""art"" inside of it. I honestly don't understand peoples complaints with this.Incredible quality for the price. Okay, so, I tend to leave things a bit late. I have an art show coming up and of course I waited too long and none of my local frame shops could help me, so I ordered 30 of these frames, expecting them to be low quality, but I needed SOMETHING.They are awesome. They came packed so well that not a single one out of the 30 were damaged, at all. Nice styrofoam, lots of air packs. The frames are great quality, the glass is sturdy and after a bit of a cleanup, shows very nicely. The best part was the hanging hardware. Since no gallery will accept sawtooth hangers (MUST BE WIRE) these came with the easiest wire hanging kits I've ever seen. Saved my butt and my art show.When we boarded our dogs while we were on a trip to see our son get married, our wonderful pet sitter took some great pictures, as well as having the dogs do some paintings. I bought this frame for an enlargement of one of the pictures she took.Years ago, I owned an art gallery and did a lot of framing. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this frame, and the value in the price. It came with a mat, which I didn't use. It also had a backing that was of a decent thickness. It comes with pre-installed hangers for either a horizontal or vertical picture, as well as the hardware to hang it with a wire. It was well packaged.It's a nice attractive frame. If I need to frame a picture in the future I would buy another one of these.Great quality frame, was shipped very carefully and packed immaculately, so kudos to them! Of all the frames I purchased it�s the only one I am actually writing a review because I am truly impressed. The quality is far superior than the others, it shows how much thought and experience they have. From the way they set up the back with an opening to lift, to the extra optional hardware, everything is perfect. The frame is sturdy, with great glass and looks beautiful. I wish they would make them in different thickness and styles, I would be customer number one!Pro's:","Pro's:

Built-in filter keeps air clean; can be removed, washed, and reused. Includes 24 hour on/off timer, auto restart, auto shutoff, clean filter alert, sleep mode, adjustable air direction, and 3 fan speed settings. Fits standard windows with a minimum window height/width of 14 x 23 inches and max height/width of 36 x 36 inches. Includes a window-mounting kit with adjustable side panels that expand to fit standard windows. 6.5 foot, 3-prong, 115V power cord6 stars!Unbelievable how there are reviews with damaged units. The way this unit was packaged, it could fall off a truck and still be perfect. The package engineering was beyond overkill. Within 5 minutes, lowered the temp in my attic by 2 degrees. After 1 hour, it is 70f degrees in there. 98f outside, attic is 770sq feet. I had 2 6000btu portables that couldn't get the temp under 88degrees f. You will not find a better deal, dont be like me and do it all yourself, it weighs 78lbs...you can see my stomach muscle imprint on the condenser fins lol. All in all 100% satisfied.This Unit pushes a lot of Cold Air, even when it's 90+ Degrees outside, before 2nd floor used to get between 85-87 on a 95 Degree Day, Now I keep 2nd floor at 77 during the Day and 75 at night. Remote included works OK, just point at the unit while pressing the buttons / functions on the remote ( No Batteries included 2*AAA ). I Might not recommend this unit for a bedroom, because it does sound loud, not crazy loud but loud enough, I think approx 78 decibels when at full speed. It is on the heavy side, specially towards the rear of the unit, the window sealing part is about 4 inches from the front our at about 30% of the total length, so I purchased an AC Window Bracket ( Several different models on Amazon ) and installed it in order to not rely solely on the window frame keeping the unit in place. The bracket allows the rear and heaviest part of the AC to rest on the bracket, and not just have the window frame support it in place. So Far very happy with the purchase. Also bought 4 year extended warranty because with this weather, it will get lots of use!. The unit is in my office and with the door open, it cools my office and another bedroom plus the hall / TV room. It will fit a regular Window Frame, it is not too wide, but it is deep, also get yourself some 3m Silicone Seal Strip,Weather Stripping for Door or Window,Weatherproof Soundproof Self Adhesive to seal the unit at the joints so no cold air comes out and no hot air comes in.Awesome! Love the way it cools my open floor plan. I used to have two smaller units but I replaced them with this unit. It was cheaper than buying two. Also my daily electric usage dropped significantly, I expected it to be the same or at best half my old daily usage. It is better than half the the old usage. I should have done this year's agoI bought this AC, 8 years ago (2013) under the name SPT...Great AC unit. It lasted 8 years. Now it is sold under the name Amazon Basics. In fact my old remote control (from the SPT) operates the new Amazon Basic AC (as I thought it would). Although it comes with ""expandable curtains"", I used ""Lexan"" instead of Plexiglass (my be overkill) because Lexan has a higher impact rating than Plexiglass. I used Wooden Dowels to hold the thinner Lexan in place...I also used ""Backer Rod for Gaps and Joints"" which is a round insulation to fill the gaps (different sizes). To answer another reviewers question about the ""follow me"" setting...here is how it works: Your AC has a temperature sensor that turns the AC ""on"" or ""off"" (depending on your settings) when the air temperature (around your AC unit) hits your desired temperature ...the follow me setting is used to ""detach: that temperature sensor on your AC unit and to use the temperature sensor built into the remote (very cool) ie. your AC is in a long but narrow room..and the AC is at the other end of the room...You have your AC set to 76 degrees on the AC unit, but at your bed 50 feet away the temperature is 81 degrees..using the follow me setting (set at 76 degrees) the temp around your bed will be 76 degrees (if you set the remote by your bed)....You could just set your AC temp to 72 degrees (appx) and obtain the same results.....just don't take the remote outside in the follow me setting.Note: Like another reviewer stated (Jason M) """"this unit is well packed""""...sounds like someone didn't read the instructions stating ""2"" people are needed to install the unit...it is ""just"" heavy enough to be awkward with a single person trying to install. This baby ROCKS !!!! and in 8 years I will be back.My old ac went out and I ordered this one. It arrived perfectly and I waited to install it so all the oils and freon could settle. Then my nephew and I installed it no problem. I really like the crisp white color. I had to study the manual to learn all the little symbols and I guess the remote will come in handy when I figure that out. Overall I'm super happy to not suffer in this Texas heat. It's not too loud and everyone notices how much cooler my room is.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: NATURALLY RESISTANT TO DECAY: Made from 100% Cedar Wood. CERTIFIED STRONG: Pro-Tect certified performance; third party certified to withstand up to 6,391 pounds or up 30 inches of snow load. EASY ASSEMBLY: Pre-cut, pre-drilled, pre-stained and supported by the step-by-step interactive BILT app. HEAVY DUTY: 29 gauge steel roof provides dent and corrosion resistance. POWERED UP: Exclusive removable PowerPort feature, with 3 electrical outlets and 3 USB ports that is transferable to any post on the structure. PowerPort can be used for charging devices, lights and more. PowerPort needs power source to be functional (not included).. COMFORT IN ANY REGION: heat insulation in the steel roof reduces heat transfer by up to 20 degrees. TIMELESS DESIGN: Handsome corbel design with bracket and hardware accentsDelivery company was great . No damage. Product is very nice quality . Unless you are extremely handy and up for a challenge, I would suggest paying the extra $500 to have it built. It states 2 people can do it in 9 hrs. Took me the wife and 2 kids 12hrs. I work as a Refrigeration tech and have built 2 houses of my own. I found this project overwhelming upon opening the boxes . After about 2 hrs in, things came together and started to make more sense. This is not something you are going to slap together in a couple hrs. Really need 3-4 people. The roof panel assemblies are very heavy to lift into place . I found the paper directions easier to work with , rather then the app directions.Out of all the gazebos we looked at, this was by far the sturdiest looking one. Our delivery company was great and dropped it right where I needed it. I still had to move it to the back yard, but I had a dolly so no big deal. Many reviewers will note, this is not a job that is quickly completed. I managed to assemble 99.8% of this myself. At one point I did need my wife to hold up one side while I got the base stood upright and cross-members in place. The kids also helped me rotate it into place. The only step I was worried about alone was the roof. I deviated from the instructions and built the frame first without installing the sheet metal. Once the frame was up, squared and in place. I installed the tin roofing one piece at a time. Its more ladder work, but for those wondering if you can do this as a one man show, you can. I worked on this when I had time, so over all I would say it took me ~14 hours to complete. If you are putting this on an existing deck, I would suggest installing this on support beams or re-enforcing underneath as this thing is heavy.Some of the other reviews on here are comical lol! I built this in 9hrs over 4 days with the help of my 16 year old son. His master lego experience was super helpful! Seriously. My wife helped by bringing sodas and energy drinks. Seriously. This structure is well designed and stout. Its very sound and easy to get square. The paper manual is good when combined with the 3D video app. My only feedback is that the factory should remove the paint from the bolt threads. The paint makes for jammed nuts at times. Otherwise a super product and very attractive architecture. Don't drink while assembling, it makes things take longer.??We love our new gazebo! Purchased for our pool area. Highly recommend to use professional to assemble unless you are handy in construction. Very heavy! Also check all parts to ensure no damage or missing parts. We had one broken piece and several that had gouges. We were concern that we would not have the replacement parts in time for the following week scheduled assembly date. We call late on a Tuesday afternoon and advised the customer service rep of our upcoming assembly date. She arranged to have the parts department ship overnight once they had all the parts. By Friday we had all the parts! Great customer service! The wood is stained but you should use a sealant to protect from fading! Greatest purchase!I�m 59 and my neighbor is 69. We both have considerable experience building and lots of tools. It took us three half-days to put it together and used a tractor to lift the roof panels into place. The gazebo is sturdy and well designed. It came in five boxes, all the wooden components and bags of screws & fasteners are well labeled. The instructions are mainly pictures and clearly show how it goes together. To square the first roof panel, we stood the completed framework on its side, then attached the panels one at a time, making sure they were square. To lift the panels on to the roof, I used a tractor. The panel is fairly heavy, but very awkward for only two people to lift. It was nice we didn�t have to actually get on the roof. Everything can be done with a ladder from below. We used battery power tools for putting most of the fasteners together, two people really make it go faster. Some of the wood, especially the edge pieces are so soft, I used a hand screwdriver to put in. We also put down a large tarp to build on, but some of the wood got scraped/scuffed up anyway. I used old English furniture cover up, which worked well. Overall a very good experience�Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: MULTIPLE FRAMES COLLAGE:Bulk of 5 pieces Picture Frames set in the same Sizes.Perfect for Pictures 11x17 with Mat or 12x18 Without Mat.. SAFE MATERIAL:These frames light but firm,has plastic cover instead of glass,when they fall to the ground you won't worry about hurting the kids.. EASY MOUNTING:Spring type action to remove the backing,can be hung horizontally or vertically.. GIFT& BE MERRY:Our 12x18 frame set not only the simple yet classic design for any home or office decor, but also a heartfelt gifts for everyone.. INTACT PARTS AND PACKING:5pcs Non-traces are included.Protective Packaging let you don't have to worry about receiving damaged products.All in all they are pretty flimsy. The front is plastic, not glass. But for the price you can�t beat them and once they�re on the wall they look great! They come with the mat & a hanging device too which is a plus! I got 20 for a gallery wall and I couldn�t be happier with the outcome. One frame front was scratch and the company was easy to contact and work with and offered to send me another frame hassle free.the plastic ""glass"" slightly bows out. You can tell with light reflection. Other than that the turn button hinges on back hold really well and the frames plus mats look great.These frames are GREAT for the money! I ordered 4 Fornite prints from Amazon, and used these frames for those, and they look amazing! They will go in my sons game room. If you know anything about really nice high end frames, they are EXPENSIVE! So if you are expecting some show stopper frames for your living room, and want to show off your priceless family pictures.....these are not the frames for you! These frames are black plastic frames with some sort of plexiglass for the glass, and you get a 5 pack for this price.....it's great! The fact that they also come with a mat, is fantastic! I got 8 x 10 Fortnite photos and were able to make them look larger, and more stunning with the white mat. The only thing I can complain about is that the plexiglass has TWO of those peel offs, on each side which I thought was a little bit of an overkill, but hey.....if the only thing I can complain about is extra protection for quality control, that says a lot. For the folks that want to complain these were ""hard to hang"", then I guess they've never hung a picture, because every photo I've ever hung in my entire life was hard to hang. Unless you use command strips........and I think these are too thin for command strips. You might be able to hang it with a nail/screw, and then use a command strip to make sure it doesn't ""shift"" on the wall.I bought two sets of these for my gallery wall and they�re exactly what I was looking for. They aren�t glass but they look really clear so it didn�t bother me.I used 3M command strips to hang since they�re super light but it did come with nail hooks. Totally worth the price!!!Good bang for the buck. They�re not high end gallery frames/matte/glass. But, they are awesome for quickly matting, framing a photograph. The film on both sides of the plastic (not glass) takes a second to figure out how to remove, but afterwards removes easily. The frames are worth the price point, ship nicely in a box with little chance of damage in-transit to your house. Buy a few, or a few different sizes from this brand at these prices, you�ll finally frame those photographs you�ve been meaning to!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Comes with Regular Glass and a sawtooth hanger for wall mounting. Made of Wood - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it. For other colors and non-standard sizes in this frame style search '2WOM0066-60823-YRED-4x4' on amazon.com. Fits 16x16 inch Photos Actual Frame size (finished size) is 17.5x17.5 inches and the frame is 1 inches wide, Please Note: Actual color and wood grain may vary depending on the cut of wood and wood color. A rich dark red stain, sets the tone with this modern frame for any space with its bright bold hue and casual vibe, Pair it with colorful prints,eclectic artwork or bright posters for a complimentary addition to your existing decorWhat is pictured is not what you get. I should have checked the product description, which says the frame is 1 inch wide, so I guess the joke is on me.It will do, but I probably won�t buy another frame from them. I�m disappointed because the frame I purchased from them for for my last family picture was beautiful and as advertised.Lovely solid wood frame with plastic, not glass. Excellent quality. Wood is very hard and not easy to attach the screws for the wire. Almost need a little drill to start the hole. The one thing I dislike about the frame are the steel push pins that keep the back in place. I hate that kind of attachment, reason for only 4 stars. I looked for over an hour at all the prime frames to find an easier and more satisfactory way to secure the backing and could find no 18x22 frame. Sad the backing was what I wanted but the didn't have the right size. Older adults don't have the skill to remove and replace these little stick pins. Once I got it mounted and backing replace I hung it on the wall. Looks great!! Will say the honey color shown in the picture is more red than it actually is. Packaging was outstanding. The box was a floating cardboard frame so no damage could occur. Box was easy to unpack. Tools needed are screw driver, hammer, needle nose pliers small nail or drill to make the hole for the hangers AND good eyesight to find the slits on the wood for the push pins.There is absolutely nothing attractive about this frame. The ""cherry finish"" is actually a dark opaque brown on the face of the frame � not a hint of cherry red tones. Mine has a noticeable splotch of dried stain puddled near the corner. There is a very slight sheen but not enough to relieve the dull flat matte look overall. The hardware packet was missing the sawtooth hanger and tacks. With a frame this light, the piece would constantly be shifting if it were hung with the wire/screws that were included. I wouldn't buy a thing from this vendor again.The frame is much thinner than what that first picture makes it look like. Just pay attention to the measurements. It really looks fine once it's up, and it is technically wood. Not glass, just plastic. But if you're on a budget and you're not going to be handling it and staring at it from 2 inches away, it's pretty good for the price. My only other budget suggestion to get something better would be to use a 40% off coupon at Michael's and buy something they have off the rack. This works just fine and I'm sure it won't bother me now that it's hanging. Just not awesome.Purchased this for a oddly sized pre-matted fine art piece. I didn't want to have to go to a frame shop for an already matted picture. The walnut finish matches perfectly and is very rich with a slight shine to it. It finishes the piece perfectly. The frame arrived very well packaged (there was no chance it could break) as this seller always does.I have had good luck with this seller in the past. Their smaller frames come with glass (sawtooth hardware) and larger frames with plexiglass (wire hanger hardware). The one con with this seller and for this frame is that it comes with a sawtooth hanger you have to hammer into the wood yourself. You don't need to predrill the holes, but that might help, honestly. The wood is pretty thick so it's a bit tricky to do since you have to give it quite a bit of force without breaking anything or putting it off center. If you're stronger than average and decent with a hammer, it's no big deal. It would be really useful if these came preinstalled. If you're only doing one, it's not that bad. However, I've done five in a row before and it's quite a chore. But after it's all over, you have a nice frame for not much money that fits your picture perfectly so it's worth it.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: OUTPERFORMS FIBERGLASS, WASHABLE AND NON-ELECTROSTATIC 3-month pleated 1 in. home air filters for your furnace, air conditioner or HVAC system. DESIGNED WITH EXCLUSIVE Filtrete Brand 3-in-1 technology from 3M to trap unwanted air particles while letting cleaner air flow through. ATTRACTS AND CAPTURES microscopic particles such as smoke, cough and sneeze debris, bacteria and viruses--and large particles, including lint, household dust and pollen. 1500 MPR has a rating of MERV 12. The higher the MPR, the more microparticles--such as pollen, pet dander, smoke, bacteria and viruses--your filter will capture from the air passing through it. 54% SMALL PARTICLE CAPTURE, like bacteria and particles that carry viruses ( % captured is based on ASHRAE 52.2 testing for 0.3 to 1 micron particles from the air passing through the filter, which relates to HVAC industry standard efficiency testing). CERTIFIED as asthma & allergy friendly (As outlined in report ASCR: 1246-01)After moving into my house 2 years ago, I had the crawlspace and attic encapsulated and insulated, followed by installation of an energy recovery ventilation system and sealing of the baseboards of all outer walls. The HVAC consultants who did this work explained that my house is now extremely �tight,� i.e. the ERV brings fresh air and exhausts stale air out, and the house no longer leaks air. The last thing I want to do is upset the air pressure by choosing the wrong filter after the complicated renovations. Thus I tried the Filtrete 1500 because the top reviewer for this product said it had the lowest pressure drop.I think the Filtrete 1500 works as well as the Filtrete 1900 and Filtrete 1200 with charcoal in my house (I rate them all a 5), but no filter has been as important as frequent vacuuming. I use a Miele vacuum cleaner throughout the house once a week, then use a Swiffer WetJet on the hardwood floors. I also vacuum the curtains and baseboards about once every 2 months. If you do this consistently, dust bunnies never have a chance to form, and the air that recirculates in the house gets cleaner and cleaner over time. The extra house work pays off in better health and lower costs. After 2 years of this cleaning routine, my allergies improved so much that I stopped using antihistamines, and filters easily last 3 months.Filtrete filters are not the cheapest alternative out there, but they are all I buy. Filtrete has filters with varying degrees of filtration and clear explanations of the difference in quality. If you just need to filter out dust and don't need to worry about allergens, the filter grade lets you choose the cheaper filter. On the other hand, if you do have to be concerned about allergens or bacteria and viruses, you can find the filter you need. The filtration levels are matched by price levels, but you know what you are getting. With many brands, you get a filter, but you do not really know the quality of the filter.Ordered these in Sept. so that when my current supply of filters was done I had them ready. By the time I installed one, Feb. 15, 2020, it was too late to return them so maybe this review will save people some money. Immediately after replacing an older filter (not the same type) I began having furnace problems. Furnace blower would run but cool air was being blown out vents. I called my furnace guy, who I have relied on for over 20 years, and over the phone he told me to take the filter out and run without filter until he could get there the next day. Furnace ran just fine once this filter was out. Next day he stopped by to check out furnace and took a look at filter. He told me to throw them out they are so dense it is like putting a sheet of cardboard in filter slot. Now using basic filter which is much cheaper and can replace more often. The density of the filter prevents some furnaces from firing up, not enough air flow. For some people this may not be the issue if their furnace is newer, but if you have an older furnace then you may want to consider a different type of filter. Too late for me but maybe this will help someone.We have two German Shepherds and one blue tick beagle/hound. Daily chores include vacuuming (requires dumping bin twice full of dog hair, 1/4 cup of dust in bottom). We have to change ours WEEKLY.If you don't want your house smelling like the pound (your nose adjusts if your homeowner, guests notice), or sensitive sinuses/allergies like myself- you'll want these filters.They capture so much from the air. The DRAWBACK is the price. And if you have dogs like I do, these filters get black QUICK. We have to change ours every 5-7 days during the summer/winter months when unit is flowing air the most. We also have a air purifier in the room that helps.I hate the price but I've tried lesser quality or less rated and it just doesn't do the job. So we just have to pay up as cost of owning dogs!I run the fan in my AC constantly. A few years ago my convection oven malfunctioned and set fire to what I was cooking. Luckley fire was contained to the oven. Smoked up the wall behind it, and the bottom of the cabinets above it. Left a great oder in the house even after moving the oven outside. I then noticed their was no smoke evidence from my air registers. The filter caught all of it. Replaced it and within a short time the oder was gone. I won't be without them.Pro's:","Pro's:

Acesulfame K contains the carcinogen methylene chloride. Long-term exposure to methylene chloride can cause headaches, depression, nausea, mental confusion, liver effects, kidney effects, visual disturbances, and cancer in humans.

Second, the taste is amazing when you combine it with milk instead of water (I don't usually care about the carbs that come with it). And third, this product has all the nutrients you need without the unnecessary extra sugar, carbs, and fat. I use it every single day for replacement for meals sometimes or for a snack. I do use it for the extra protein I need for exercising and this helps me meet my macro goals.I bought this, as a suggest from a friend. New to protein powders I knew I didn't want anything that tasted ""lab created"" or chemically. She suggested this flavor and Brand, and I've been super happy with it. I bought a second container AND same company different flavor as well. I've been super happy with their taste and will continue to purchase more.

It is the perfect protein snack to get going in the morning, through an afternoon slump or past a nightly craving..

ONE PLANT bars have 12 grams of plant-based protein, 1 gram of sugar and come in crave-worthy flavors.. THE ONE PROTEIN BAR: Congratulations, You've Found the ONE. Protein bar, that is. The Churro flavor is vegan and gluten-free. With 12g of protein and just 1g of sugar, this bar is an anytime treat.This bar exceeded expectations, by far. It's tasty, great macros and really enjoyed eating the whole bar! I'll stock up now that I know it's so good. Bravo ONE Brands!!Easy to carry protein bar that is not a candy bar, like so many so called protein bars on the market. Great to carry as a quick snack in between meals. Makes it easier to get my 90 grams of protein requirements. Good tastingThese are amazing. I�ve tried every plant protein bar I can get my hands on and these are one of the tastiest I�ve had. I almost always have a sweet tooth and this snack helps with my chocolate cravings.Ok first thing to remember here is that these are geared to VEGETARIANS if not VEGANS! If you have no problem getting your protein from cows (like whey) and can digest it properly/are not allergic then there is no real reason to even consider these. Are they anything like the Regular ""One"" Whey Protein Bars we all know and love? Of course not! Are they supposed to be?? Of course not!! Just like ""One"" bars are not specifically designed for The Atkins, Keto, or Paleo diet, ""One"" Plant Protein Bars may not be designed for yours. Everything in life is a trade off. How important is it to you to save the environment? To not have any products that come from animals? To not make yourself sick by eating something u might be allergic to? If the answer to yourself is sorta, kinda, maybe, or very then you should definitely give these a try.They are definetly more grainy than regular Whey One Bars. Not nearly as decadent and sweet. However they are smaller, which means less calories (also much less protein/being that it is plant based this is probably much better for someone looking to slim down rather than bulk up), less carbs (more sugar alcohol), and still have high quality fiber. The ingredients are top notch and they do have a nice cinnamon flavor. The problem I think for most people will be the texture. For some too dry or cardbord like, especially compared to the non plant based protein One Bars which are like silky smooth velvet.Can you find better Plant based Protein Bars out there? More than likely. I do not know as I am not currently in the market for them. What I can say is that you must compare these to those and not regular Whey Protein Bars. Apples to Oranges as they say. Both are fruits grow on trees and have seeds (right?) and then the myriad of differences begin ??!I�ve been dairy-free for going on 10 years and have struggled to find a really good protein bar, not made from dairy/milk derivatives. I can honestly say I�ve tried basically every vegan protein bar on the market, but never was able to stick with one particular brand for long, due to one or more key factors - too little protein, too much sugar, an unpleasant taste, or inconsistent quality. My fianc� loves the original One bars, so I decided to give these a try.Finally, a vegan, plant-based protein bar that checks all the boxes - high in protein (12 grams, enough to keep me full until lunch), relatively low in sugar (1 gram + 6 grams of sugar alcohol), awesome taste, and consistently high quality. I always steered towards the chocolate flavored protein bars, so I tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter first, which is what got me hooked. When the financial strain of the pandemic hit 5 months ago, requiring us to tighten up our budget, I decided to save a few dollars and order the cheapest One Bar Plant Protein flavor on Amazon at that time, which was the Banana Nut Bread. To my surprise, these bars instantly became my all-time favorite! They taste exactly like a perfect slice of banana nut bread, just with an added twist of a decadent frosting on top. I�m telling you, some kind of Willy Wonka magic was used to make a protein bar flavor that so perfectly mimics the real thing! The Banana Nut Bread also flawlessly masks any hint of the plant-based protein, a major complaint I�ve had with other bars. And no more worries about inconsistent quality issues, as every box contains the freshest bars, as if they were shipped directly off the factory belt.ADDED BONUS: I had basically stopped ordering these types of heat-sensitive food products off Amazon, especially during the summer months, because they were ruined into a melted mess by the time the order arrived. Not the One Plant Protein Bars! They are carefully packaged in a styrofoam cooler, with a large ice pack, for each shipment. While I could purchase the exact bars from our local GNC, often at lower sale price, it�s this type of service that keeps me going back to Amazon. Thank you for going the extra mile!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE? We set out to create a different kind of bar; a protein bar that tastes like candy, but is still soft, tasty, and amazingly nutritious! So what�s our secret?

Good! gluten free protein bars are sweet on the outside, and good on the inside.. TRUSTED, HIGH PROTEIN SNACK: good! snacks went out to create the one protein bar unlike any other. One that people would truly enjoy and grab on the go. Satisfy your sweet tooth with a protein bar so good you�ll think it�s a candy bar.. BIRTHDAY CAKE 12 PACK: With your order, you will receive 12 crave worthy bars in every box! With flavors ranging from cookie dough to peanut butter, and lemon, consider it your guilty pleasure, without the guilt. Finally, a snack that helps get you going, and keep you going!I tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor and, like many of the reviewers, think the taste and texture is good. However, I won�t be a repeat buyer. Surprised I didn�t catch it on my first pass of the ingredients list, but I�m disappointed that it (like a lot of mass produced protein bars) contains palm kernel oil, which is a cheap, generally unhealthy source of fat. It�s very high in saturated fat, and its inclusion suggests the manufacturer was content with an inexpensive industrial oil rather than one with real consumer benefits.First of all a case of 12 bars for $20 that include ingredients like Good! Snack protein bars is remarkable. I freaking love this brand. I got a variety pack and ended up purchasing several flavors.Birthday cake: reminds me of funfetti white cake with frosting & sprinklesBlueberry: blueberry muffin with the soft texture and coating makes it sweeterLemon: I am absolutely shocked how much I love this flavor. It taste like a lemon pound cake or anything like that that you could imagine but better.... with frosting.Chocolate peanut butter: this is usually my favorite flavor but with this brand it isn�t. There�s something off about the peanut butter. Sometimes I like it and sometimes I don�t. I did not buy a box of these.Cookies and cream: I don�t love or hate these and didn�t buy a box. I was considering getting up to try this flavor to describe it for the review but my dog is laying on me & if you�re a dog lover you get it.......I�m not moving.Honestly, I love to try new protein bars and I have maxed out my GNC points trying every new bar that comes in ?? these are incredible though. The flavor is so there, the texture is perfect- so soft with a soft chocolate shell on the outside. Perfect little chocolate chips throughout. The ingredients are solid! They use a fava bean and brown rice protein blend! I have noticed when I over consume whey products, my chin breaks out. I was more than excited to see this protein blend! As a protein connoisseur I highly recommend, as I will continue to buy most definitely.These are absolutely delicious! I have been trying to find a good tasting vegan protein bar that isn�t made with pea protein for a long time. While Square Bars are good, they lack fiber to keep me full for more than an hour.These are chewy with a creamy, sweet coating and have no weird aftertaste. Most vegan bars are chalky and dry. These are anything but. I tried the lemon bar and it wasn�t too in your face or artificial tasting, ad reminded me of lemon cookie. I can�t wait to try more flavors. These have become my new favorite bar!I eat about 100 grams of protein per day and get tired of protein shakes. These bars are a great way to mix up my routine. They look and taste great! I will be trying other flavors soon.Pro's:","Pro's:

Vegan certified, Non-GMO Project Verified, with no artificial sweeteners, flavors or colors.. 25 SERVINGS PER CONTAINER, contents may settle during shipping. Don�t worry, that�s normal. You�re still getting all the servings listed on your product.I have been using this product for 3+ years when Costco use to sell it. Then Costco change to the organic which I did not like and found it on amazon. I was very excited. The product and the cost was the same as Costco. I have this on auto- delivery every month and received the new flavor. At first I thought I did something wrong. It was thicker than usually and I had to add more water to thin it down with the yogurt and berry mix I make. Then the taste. It's a lot sweeter than before and I really cannot describe the taste. It leaves an after taste in your mouth. I had to check other reviews to see if anyone else experienced the same and sure enough. I am not the only one. I do not understand why the manufacture had to change anything about this product. It was fine the way it was before. I cannot eat this. I have a full bottle that I don't think I can make myself finis ith. I am canceling my auto-delivery. Bring back the old formula, please!! You will lose more customers specifically those who knew what it use to taste like before the change.I absolutely loved the Vanilla Proteins and Greens. This new formula is chalky and has a terrible chemical aftertaste. After years of being faithful to Vega I will be returning my latest purchases and seeking a different brand. Please bring back the old powder!!UPDATE 11/29/17: so in order not to waste this expensive product I used a partial scoop to mitigate the sweetness. However, my jar now has now produced non-vegan protein�maggots! Ugh! I�m not kidding. I�ve only used about five servings before these hatched inside the jar. This is really bad people. I don�t know where this product is being manufactured, but buyer beware!!! This truly trumps my previous review. See pics taken this morning.Original review: At first sip, it was overpowering sweetness. I don�t eat sugar and try to avoid more than a drop full of the stevia at a time. The texture and taste otherwise are what�s expected from a pea-based powder, but a full 10 minutes later I still can�t get the aftertaste of the stevia and fake cherry out of my mouth! Every time I walk past the sink where I opened the stuff, I can smell the stevia. The seal was also punctured as others noted. I bet it was done by the manufacturer to release the unnatural smell of this stuff. I immediately cancelled my subscription to this product. Back to looking for a truly sweetener-free protein powder. This is a massive fail.We have been using the old formula for over a year, practically every morning in smoothies. Purchased this new formula and tried it once. Using the same amount we always had produced an extremely thick and gritty goo that was unpalatable. This new formula has cut out the hemp powder and the sodium has gone way up. We returned it immediately and went to our local Natural Grocer to find a replacement. Ended up trying Garden Of Life RAW Protein and Greens; It is a much better substitute than this New formula.As a lacto-vegetarian, I struggle with getting enough protein and have always had to supplement with protein shakes. I've always used a different brand (Jarrow's) for protein shakes but was looking for a vegan berry-flavored one. This one came with STELLAR reviews.Unfortunately, I'm not sure why.In addition to having the GRITTY TEXTURE like you dropped your shake at the beach and then scooped it back into your shaker bottle, this has the most CHEMICAL taste ever. There's no berry flavor, but there is a heavy, fake-sweetener taste with a hint of berry-ish in the aftertaste. If anyone is doing a sugar-free diet. this will make you bowled over with how sweet it is. And not in a good way. It made me wince, because it was so synthetic.I gave it three tries. The third time I added it to a berry smoothie, which, when blended, could ABSOLUTELY still be tasted, but was at least able to get down. My husband said I made a face after each sip, which I didn't even realize I was doing. It was just that bad--even when blended with fruit and Greek yogurt and ice.This was SO expensive, so I'll power through it rather than throwing it away. But if I had money to throw away, this would be going right into the trash.I will NEVER buy this brand again and am shocked at all of the rave reviews.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 5 lbs of Dymatize Elite Whey Rich Chocolate Protein Powder (63 Servings). 5.5g of Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) to help build muscle and aid in recovery; 2.7g of L-Leucine to support activation of Muscle Protein Synthesis. Good pre, post-workout, or anytime for high-quality protein supplementation. Packaging may vary. Scientifically proven, fast-digesting, quick-absorbing, 100% whey proteinNot only does it taste like Starbucks, it also has the same great amounts of protein as the more expensive iso 100. And yes the elite is not hydrolyzed. This means it doesn't mix quite as easily but still will mix fine. It also doesn't get absorbed as fast by the body, however I don't really notice a difference. This protein is still great and will help you build or maintain muscles/recover from workouts.The cafe mocha flavor is my favorite. I prefer it to gormet chocolate, Orange Dreamsicle, and the strawberry flavors. I also prefer the coffee flavor over optimum nutrition chocolate. If you like coffee taste, you will love this protein powder.about me: I work out 6 times a week for roughly 1 hour a session.Be careful if you are looking for the typical ISO100 Whey Protein Isolate. This is the same packaging but for some reason, a cheaper garbage version of what you may be looking for.This is Whey protein concentrate with some added isolate plus hydrolyzed whey concentrate. The key difference is the absorption. Isolate provides your body with quickly absorbed high quality protein while the concentrate is just inferior, low quality garbage that provides protein but not in the same way. You will feel the difference.Be sure to search for Isolate and stay away from this.Product on the Left was the new FAKE protein I just received. Product on the Right was the first one I bought. It had a paper seal (as has every tub I�ve ever bought). The new/fake product on the left had a metallic seal. This was the first red flag. The second red flag was the missing Dymatize Logo on the lid (see other photo). The plain lid didn�t even fit the tub properly. I�m 99.9% sure I received a knock off/tampered with product. I will buy directly from GNC or other store in the future. Who knows what was in this tub!!I was happy to find a cheaper version of the fruity pebbles compared to the 76 dollar iso100. I cant compare directly to the iso100 version of fruity pebbles but I've had the Cinnabon iso100 which was great so ill compare quality to that. Right off the bat this protein tastes great. I only use water for my shakes and this tastes dead on like fruity pebbles even with little pieces of the cereal scattered in the tub. The biggest difference between the iso100 and this version of whey was mainly the bendability. This while still blending easily doesn't come close to how well the iso 100 blends. But for a near 50% less cost compared to the iso100 version I can get over that. As someone with Ulcerative colitis its hard to find proteins that doesn't have me in the bathroom all day and just like the iso100 this is very easy on my stomach. cant wait to try it in some milk got to be even better id imagine.I've tried 6 or 7 different low and no carb protein powders in the last 2 years. This stuff is the best if the bunch. In taste, mix ability, muscle care, etc. Sometimes I'll eat nothing but protein pancakes for 3 days straight and be fine with it. Feels like I'm cheating. Tastes like vanilla birthday cake. Mix 3 eggs, 3 scoops of this, and a few splashes of almond milk (check the label, almond milk can be 17g of carbs, or 1g. I buy the cheapest stuff from Walmart or Aldi's that has 1g or even <1g carb). Mix it all up, if it's too runny, add some more powder. Put the batter on a griddle after rubbing it down with butter. Flip after 3 mins. And in about 5 mins you'll have the best tasting pancakes. I like lots of butter and that's my diet - high fat, zero sugar which some day increases testosterone. Out of all the proteins on Amazon, all in the $35-$55 range for 4 or 5 pounds, nothing works as well as this stuff. Adding baking soda only makes it bloated and brings out the egg taste way too much so I skip it. If you want to lose a few inches in 3 weeks, each these for 2 meals a day. Or, do yourself a favor and get a good shaker cup. You can make a 75g protein milkshake in one cup and you're good. Bottom line is, I've bought them all, tried them all, and Dymatize Elite is by far the best in all categories. Tastes great, truly. I feel like I should be getting fat eating this and drinking this because it's so tasty. It's worth the extra few dimes a day! Save yourself the trial and error and several hundred bucks - I did that for you. One caveat- I can only vouch for vanilla. It's my favorite but I can't imagine it's much different in other flavors. I like syntha-6 cookies and cream too, but it didn't cook as well. Sandy pancakes. Enjoy! Grab a tub.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 20 GRAMS OF PLANT-BASED PROTEIN sourced from peas, a delicious and more sustainable source of protein.. NON-GMO PROJECT VERIFIED and made without artificial flavors or sweeteners and with no colors from artificial sources.. GOOD SOURCE OF calcium, iron, vitamin B12 and zinc, which are an important part of any diet, and are particularly important for those whose diets are light in, or lack, meat, eggs and dairy.. 10 GRAMS OF FIBER, an excellent source of fiber to help support a healthy digestive system.. EVOLVE�S COMMITMENT TO THE OUTDOORS starts with our protein source - peas. Growing peas helps to build healthy soil by returning much needed nitrogen back into the ground. Healthy soil builds better resilience to pests, erosion, disease, and extreme weather, making pea protein more sustainable for the planet.. PROUD NATIONAL PARKS FOUNDATION PARTNER, helping to protect and ensure access to the outdoors for everyone.. For a limited time, formula may vary.So I'm venturing to find the best vegan protein drink that there is to offer (at a reasonable price) and this is the best one I've found thus far. The chocolate has a very smooth and light taste. Tastes very ""clean"" to me, if that makes any sense. It almost has some sort of ""green/grassy"" flavor alongside it. I'm sure that might turn people off from trying this drink but personally I find it quite pleasant. However I didn't notice that ""green"" taste in the Mocha flavored. I would describe the taste as a basic chocolate flavor, not quite as good as their actual chocolate flavor but still enjoyable enough to finish off what I purchased.I would recommend giving this product a try. I can definitely say it is much better than the Vega bottled drinks. Those are SUPER grainy and make me feel like I'm just drinking down a bunch of powder. These Evolve drinks are completely smooth & tasty, so I'll definitely buy more in the future.While I may be partial to the Chocolate flavored shakes, the Mellow Mocha flavor tastes pretty good too! These are the only 2 flavors I�ve tried so far so I can�t speak for all the flavors, but Evolve has fast become my favorite brand of protein shakes.While I�m not vegan, I�m intolerant to both lactose and casein (dairy). This means most non-vegan options are off-the-table for me. Unlike most other vegan protein shakes, there isn�t a noticeable taste from the protein powder used (pea) and the texture is phenomenal. The chocolate shakes tastes pretty dang close to chocolate milk in both flavor and texture!At 20 grams of protein per shake and only 4 grams of added sugar, the nutrition profile is on point too. Perfect supplement to any low-protein meal or as part of a meal replacement, I almost always have one of these with me.Compared to the non-vegan Orgain protein shakes I was relying upon previously, Evolve�s protein shakes are far superior.All that and the price point is on par with, if not better than, most other similar products I�ve seen. Oddly, the shakes are significantly more expensive if you order them directly from Evolve�s website last I checked.This is only my 3rd review written on Amazon, hope it helps!I too like it well enough. This flavor is a nice change. I am allergic to milk so this is a great alternative and require a lot of protein after weight loss surgery. I like the cartons vs the bottles cause they are easier to open. I find so many of these type of drinks are sickenly sweet. I don't think these are. I've gotten them at a local chain grocery (Super One), Target and online with Amazon. Premiere Protein is quite popular but alas, it has milk, and also very very sweet.Love that this is dairy free, has 20g of protein, tastes great in my opinion, and no artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols!! Haven't been able to find a better premixed shake!Usually I love these. But this time,the packaging is defective. For the price, one would expect better quality control. The containers are not secure on the bottom and have unjoined flaps. The containers thus will not stand up and must be laid on their sides. One senses there is a chance of some leaking.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Amazing Flavor: Infused with organic Peruvian cacao, Himalayan salt, organic coconut milk, a dash of stevia & monk fruit, our award-winning protein blend is simply delicious! Add 2 scoops to cold water for tasty shakes or mix into smoothies & snacks.. Weight Management: Great protein powder for weight loss. The soluble fiber in plant protein gives you that �full� feeling for a longer period of time. You eat less but not at the expense of calories. Still packed with 20g protein per serving.. Complete Protein: Our USDA Organic vegan protein powder has a 5 protein blend of Pea, Flax Seed, Quinoa, Pumpkin Seed & Chia Seed + essential vitamins & minerals. Healthier than whey protein powder for both your body and the environment.. Digestion Support: Enhanced with powerful digestion support by DigeSEB, a proprietary digestive enzyme blend. DigeSEB aids digestion & helps the body maximize absorption by embracing & capitalizing on its ingested nutrients.. Responsibly Sourced: Nearly every ingredient is certified organic and free of gluten, dairy, soy, hormones, artificial sweeteners, colors, and GMOs. Made with USDA and CCOF certified ingredients.Of all the vegan protein powders I�ve tried, this one is the best � by a LOT. It blends smoothly, had a very, very minimal chalky texture and the flavor is insane.Here�s my favorite smoothie!:2 scoops KOS chocolate peanut butter protein4 tbsp rolled oats1 tbsp cocoa powder1 frozen banana3 ice cubes1/4 cup cold brew1 cup unsweetened almond milkEnjoy!!I�ve been using the Blessed coco coconut protein powder for a while and thought I would give KOS a try and I absolutely fell in love! I usually drink it after a workout with almond milk or soy milk, but the quality of the product is great! It goes down smoothly and isn�t Grainy at all. I love peanut butter and the product itself resembles the taste of a brownie I truly enjoy it and would recommend to anybody looking for a plant based protein!!I don't normally leave reviews but there are none for this product so I felt like I had to. I discovered KOS protein about a year ago and fell in love with it. I'm dairy free and had trouble finding a plant-based protein that actually tasted good..until I found KOS. I love the chocolate and the blueberry muffin flavors but recently I started the KETO diet and didn't want to use up half my carbs on one protein shake...so I ordered this! Unflavored, unsweetened and only 2 NET CARBS from my favorite brand! I new the taste wouldn't be amazing because it's unflavored and unsweetened but honestly, the taste is not horrible by itself. When I first tried it I mixed with 10oz of almond breeze unsweetened almond/coconut milk. The texture was GREAT just like their other proteins (smooth, no lumps), BUT I do like a little flavor. So now I mix with a little keto skinny syrup (I use jordans skinny syrup- salted caramel flavor) and it tastes delicious. Definitely recommend!I was looking for an organic sugar-free protein powder to supplement my vegan diet. It's hard to find organic sugar free protein powders! I've tried a few pea proteins but didn't like their taste or texture. I read the great reviews for this product but wasn't holding my breath, thinking, how good can any protein powder taste? But I was delighted when I first used it in a smoothy -- I loved the taste, it blended smoothly without lumps. I'm so happy that Kos offers an unsweetened, unflavored blend because I can create any taste I desire. And the digestive enzymes and other veggie/fruit goodness is a great bonus. Now I can have all the protein I need easily and tastily! One happy customer here!I am enjoying this vegan protein powder. It makes a nice tasty smoothie, I like chocolate and chocolate peanut. With banana or 1/4 avacado or nut butter, nut milk or water this makes a nice thick smoothie that is filling and satisfying. It fills me up for hours. Somedays I will have another smoothie for dinner. I am vegan so getting the protein was a concern of mine. I feel this has been a good source. I have noticed my thinning hair sheds less. I feel good. I would recommend you try this.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Modern, white and black 2-shelf desk ideal for home office, dorm room, study area or computer workstation. Durable metal frame with two open-sided wood storage shelves and wide desk top; customizable shelves can be assembled on the left or right side. Desk Dimensions: 35.5 x 19.6 x 29.5 inches (LxWxH); weighs 21.8 pounds. Easy assembly; hardware and instructions included. BIFMA CertifiedI'm currently working from home so I needed a little desk that would accommodate two monitors and a keyboard. This was accommodating. I was also able to put my phone one of the shelves.I'm using this desk for a vanity and I LOVE IT. the desk is very aesthetically pleasing, great quality and size for the price as well.Bought this to have a desk for college. Took me about two hours to put together because some of the holes weren't properly done. A trick my dad told me is to rub bar soap over nails when you're trying to screw them in and they'll go in much easier.I bought this desk to go in my 8 year old son's room, and I couldn't be happier with it. For the price, the quality simply cannot be beat, and you have two different options when it comes to what side of the desk the shelves are on. Normally at this price point, what you see is what you get, so I appreciated being able to customize it this little bit. The finish of the product was nice with no existing damage, and we received all of the parts in the box. The directions show you pretty clearly how to build it in either the A or B form, and I found them pretty easy to follow. I also ordered the AmazonBasics Low-Back Computer Task Office Desk Chair with Swivel Casters in Red which you can see in my pictures. This chair goes great with the desk, and is the perfect size for my son who is in third grade. Overall, I can't recommend this enough for anyone looking for a smaller desk that won't break the bank.I bought this desk for my bedroom and didn't think I was going to get much from it honestly, but it surprised me! I have a 24"" monitor, 2 speakers/monitors and my 15.6"" laptop with other random things on it and it has worked out great so far. It's sturdy, solid and was super easy to put together. I also like the fact you can put the shelves on either side!Pro's:","Pro's:

The enclosure is made with high quality aluminum which doubles as a heat sink. GFORCE3 is great at heat dissipation and is fan less to ensure cool and quiet operation..

The GFORCE3 hard drive comes with an external hard drive stand for vertical placement, USB 3. 0 cable and a 12V power supply. 1 Year Manufacturer with an extra year available with product registration through Fantom Drives.Its Noisy drive. Just wanted to know what's inside. Surprised!! Micronet HDD?? Which manufacterer is it? CONTACTED FANTOM DRIVE & THEY SAID ""We have SEAGATE AND HGST. Would like me to process the RMA?"" AFTER POSTING PHOTOS OF HDD INSIDE, THEN THERE IS NO REPLY!!!!ANYWAY, DRIVE LOOOKS LIKE WD WITH A LABEL. IS IT 7200RPM?? WE HAVE TO DISMANTLE IT!!CHECKED FOR SURFACE TEST WITH PARAGON DISK PARTITION AND NO BAD SECTORS. THANK GOD!I have a number of external hard drives. I know how to maintain them and what not to do when moving them, etc. I bought the Fantom from Amazon about a year ago because 1) I seemed to remember the company had a good reputation and 2) it was truly beautiful on the outside. As a matter of fact if a hard drive could be sexy then this one would easily win. After a few weeks I tried to retrieve some files I had stored on the fantom and I could not find the drive listed in my computer directory. I knew what this likely meant and to my dismay the drive was indeed defective. I did not have anything on the drive that was critical and so there was no loss of data that I did not have saved in one of the cloud services I use. It was the fact that I paid over $100 for a product that failed without warning and only about 30 minutes of use. I have 7 other external hard drives including a Toshiba, a Seagate and numerous WD products. Three of them are 5 years old and work just fine. The computer I was using is a 2016 Alienware Area 51 and has state of the art components. My point being, I have quality components, have had no other external drive failures (always plan on an external drive failing at some point...it just happens) and I know how to properly use and protect an external hard drive.Amazon is amazing when replacing a defective item and would have immediately refunded my money upon return of the item. Unfortunately when something like this happens...and it is very rare for it to happen I rarely remember to return it. This certainly may have been a one time thing. I will never know because I won't do business with this company again. Not just because I bought a product which was defective, but because I have discovered the new external hard drives from another company. I won't mention the brand because this is not an advertisement for another data storage company but their new external hard drives don't need a power source, have twice the storage and almost half the cost. Amazing.I guess my only point is, when you buy a defective product as I did you don't have to rely on the mercy of that company to replace your item. Amazon rocks because they have your back in everything you purchase. The lesson for me was not to buy something just because it is shiny and pretty. Marketing a product is rarely a true measure of how good that product is. I knew that but bought it anyway. If I'm the only one who had a problem with this product then good for everyone else and too bad for me (my attempt at humor).I purchased this drive with the intention of backing up all of my photo data once a week. What drew me especially to this drive were two things:1) It used a Type B USB3 plug, which is much sturdier than the thin USB3 ports (USB3 Micro-B) on other mainstream external hard drives such as WD and Seagate.2) The presence of a power switch. I cannot overstate my annoyance with recent external hard drives that lack on/off switch. I like to keep my external hard drives plugged in all the time but I don't want to go back there to unplug it and plug it in to my computer every time.In addition to the points above, I've been using another Fantom drive (3 Tb) for a couple years (for backup as well) and it has been running fine so far.The first thing I did when I received it was run it through a bunch of SMART tests, which came back all green, so hooray. The second test was a full surface scan, which looks at all of sectors and makes sure none of them are bad. 9 hours and 45 minutes later (would have been closer to 6.5 hours if I wasn't running some other very processor-intensive programs) it detected 0 bad sectors. Hooray again! I decided to run it through HDDScan's surface test results as well (which also shows the distribution of response times of all the sectors) and everything looked great. Checking the drive properties, it appears the disk used is the�I have a bunch of Fantom external hard drives, ranging from 2TB - 8TB, mostly Pro versions but also versions. Warranty used to be 3 years for the Pro versions. I am looking to buy additional drives now--I see that manufacturer's website now says the warranty is only 1 year limited. Most of the reviews and the product description pages here on Amazon do not mention this--most of the reviews still say 3-year warranty, which is wrong. Buyer beware. (Also note that the WD My Book currently still has a 3-year warranty. Why did Fantom change their warranty coverage length?)Received the drive today. It says it has been on for 998 hours, has been powered up 590 times, and is 5700RPM, not 7500RPM like a lot of buyers claim to have received. Looking at all of this, strongly suggests that I have paid for a used drive. I only give it two stars because it showed up, and powers up. Here is a screen capture of the drive received. It already has over 41 days of use on it, supposedly new.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: COOLS MEDIUM ROOMS - It's important to pick an air conditioner based on the room size of the room (or rooms) to be cooled. This air conditioner cools MEDIUM rooms up to 350 sq ft. 3-IN-1 PORTABLE AIR CONDITIONER - With built-in air conditioning, fan modes and dehumidifying capability for flexible & optimal home comfort. AUTO EVAPORATION TECHNOLOGY - Under most room conditions, the Auto Evaporation Technology evaporates any water the portable unit collects, so there's no need to empty a bucket. DEHUMIDIFY - The built-in dehumidifying capability balances humidity levels in the room to keep you comfortable and breathing easier. DIGITAL THERMOSTAT - Our electronic digital thermostat helps you maintain your cool and comfortI love this 3 in 1 so far. I had the GE dehumidifier but it was too hot to just dehumidify when I could get air-conditioned for an additional $150, so I returned that and got this. It was super easy to install and kicked on immediately, and the room was cool within minutes. I only needed one panel from the window kit because my windows are small. I like how it shows the temp in the room even when it is off. It hasn't been any louder than a fan on High so no complaints from me. It is heavy though but the wheels are preinstalled on the base so that helped a lot. All in all, I highly recommend this unit.Bought this unit to replace 10 year old unit that failed on one of the hottest days of the summer. It was shipped promptly and arrived from the SW US to the Pacific NW in just 4 days. Was easy to install and exceeded all expectations. Very QUIET operation, touch pad controls that are easy to use, and remote control for couch potatoes too. Now if it gives as good of service 10 years from now like my last one. I will be thrilled!Our central A.C. went out this summer, and the telephone operator stated it could take up to 2 weeks to get a tech to come out. They were backed up in several local big cities, and I live in a rural area (outside the same town as the A.C. repair company). I figured I would invest in this GE unit, because we have had no A.C. in the past, as well. My V.A. Ret. husband and his 12 year old service dog both have heart issues, and I could tell more so by the service dog breathing a mile a minute, that the heat which I could endure was not comfortable nor safe for them. I ordered this G.E. unit at 10:30 p.m. and it arrived at my rural house by dawn the very next day. It was so easy to plug in and set up the exhaust out the window. It was even easy to get it out of the box. I saw a lot of comments about the window set-up for the hose. The only extra item I had to order is the sponge insulation roll from Amazon, to keep any air or rain from coming through the very small openings between the window and the plastic. This unit cooled down a 30�x30� family room to 75 degrees (it can be turned down lower), and extended air to the living room, dining room and kitchen, with the help of 3 old tower fans, I have collected over the years. We ended up going 13 days with no Central Air, before the tech came out and replaced one damaged wire! It asks about the noise level: it makes less noise than our central HVAC unit. I only wish the remote could light up in the dark or when I push the buttons. This G.E. unit has so many awesome and handy features listed in the description. It was a blessing. I highly recommend this unit!I am going to assume most people know portable units are all around worse than windows, but you weighed the options and are getting one anyway. I liked this one because it had an energy efficiency ratio over 10 compared to windows starting at 13 and similar portable ac's being closer to 8. This meant you got more SACC cooling power per watt than the competition. Cool, so I bought it. I have regular windows and am using the unit to spot cool, which is the intended purpose of a portable unit, in my second floor office and bedroom. They have 27in and 30in windows, a rather standard size in my opinion. The provided kit DOES NOT fit in either way. It is too small at full extension of one bracket and too big at minimum extension of both brackets. This does not fit standard windows in anyway. It can fit windows 24in and below OR windows 33in and above, but NOT in between. So I had to buy a universal kit at lowes to attach the hose to the window.That is ridiculous GE can make such an energy efficient unit and create such a terrible assembly kit. If the size did fit it I will say that the components were excessively cheaply made and the lock for the hose on the sliders does not stay, so either way you pretty much have to buy another window assembly to use this unit. why still 3 stars? the unit itself is good. It is energy efficient and 8 AMP is good to not trip a breaker. This unit as most portable AC's are meant to supplement central air, not be the primary source of AC so keep that in mind. It does the job though. My sauna level WFH office is much coolerWe are so pleased with our purchase of the GE APCA10YZMW Portable Air Conditioner! It arrived and within no time it was set-up and we were enjoying the cool air. It isn't too loud and doesn't take up too much space. It is so nice to use the remote control for the settings. This is highly recommended!Pro's:","Pro's:

EASY CARE: Good quality finishing will withstand years of use. Machine washable and Wash the water temperature below 86F. Mild detergent no bleaching. Low-temperature ironing. The Drapes enjoy 30 days money-back Guarantee!I was reluctant at first to purchase these as I wanted cotton curtains. However, these have not produced any smell whatsoever which makes me a little more confident in my purchase even with them being polyester. The first photo shows how effective it is at blocking light. This was a requirement by my husband. The second photo shows how lovely the drapes hang, almost like pinch please curtains. I do have to pull them that way to align properly, but it's not a lot of work. The third photo shows how nice the stitching is and that the backing is the same color as the front. The final photo is of the back tabs of the curtains for reference in how they hang on the rods.In regards to the company: I had to contact them with an issue on one of the pairs of curtains I purchased. I sent a message at night and heard back the next morning. They immediately rectified the issue without any run around--which says a lot for companies in this day of age!I cannot believe the amazing reviews these curtains have...I literally could have hung a bed sheet over my curtain rod and had better �black out curtains�. My blinds are completely closed and still tons of sun getting in. There�s no insulation, no energy efficient backing, they�re a wrinkled mess and they smell weird to boot. These were false advertising in my opinion. I bought 5 of them and will be returning them all.These feel nice, are put together well, and are the dimensions described. They are NOT blackout curtains. Look at the lower star reviews for this product which contain pictures and you will see many pictures showing light shining through the curtains. I suspect the pictures which do not show this were taken at night or in overcast /indirect light conditions. Note how many 4 and above star reviews also have pictures clearly showing tons of light penetrating the fabric, but are left by reviewers who are rating this product based on everything but its ability to blackout. I'm a student and work random hours in a hospital and sleep at various times of the day, I need actual blackout curtains. ""Blackout""-ing ability is the reason I bought these. I believe a rational person would expect the curtains to function as described by the second word of the product title. This product would have been great (greyish white is actually really nice) if they did what they claimed to do in the title: blackout. They do not do what they claim to do. Will Return them.I got these for my baby's room since she kept waking up at 7 or earlier due to light in her room (she has a West-facing window). I went with a dark color to maximize light blocking but I don't think it was necessary for our room. Light beige probably would have been fine since we aren't fighting super bright light all day.The curtains look really nice. They have a sort of sheen to the fabric that makes it seem nicer. Unfortunately, there's already dog hair on them... Not sure why. HahaThese feel nice and heavy, much heavier than the curtains I just took down. I am VERY satisfied with the light blocking. I would definitely buy these again. Oh, and I don't need bushy curtains so I just bought one pack (with two panels) and it covers my 74"" window sufficiently.I took a before (old curtain) and after (blackout curtain) picture. It was early evening and the blinds were open.Update: the first night with the new curtains and my 2.5 month old just slept through the night for the first time. I can't say for sure it was the curtains, but I'm sure they didn't hurt.I agree with the reviews that the bottom of these curtains are not perfectly level-but pretty close. I have furniture in front of the bottoms so it is not big deal. We had blinds up but got these for a room that we turned into our living room. It was previously too bright to have the television in there so I got these, moved the rooms around and it is perfect for our living room/movie watching experience.The quality is wonderful--better than expected--and stands up to our three dogs pawing at the curtains on the sliding glass door to go outside. We can tell a difference in maintaining temperature control as well. While I can see the picky people saying they aren't completely blackout panels, they really do block out 99.9% of light.After we saw how well these held up and how nice they were we bought some for our bedroom as well and now our dogs sleep until we wake up on the weekends and they are not up at first light...bonus!Pro's:","Pro's:

The curtains look very beautiful once hung. I personally like soft and flowy curtains (note: these have a rustic look and feel). However, these curtains look beautiful in my home. I purchased x2 White & x2 dove gray curtains in the 96 inch. I personally find videos to be a lot more helpful, but my four attempts failed. I have attached three photos: 1 with natural bright lighting, 1 with no lighting, and 1 with indoor lighting to see how it looks in all three. I hope this helps in your curtain hunting expidition!P.S. I live in the valley of Anchorage, AK and shipping was free & fast since that�s usual not the case for us!These curtains are the perfect sheer-meets-burlap look we never knew we loved! Great quality, particularly for the price. The curtains let in enough natural light while maintaining privacy. We coupled the natural and taupe colors to add more texture to our bay window coverings, as pictured below.I bought it but didn�t expect too much. It came out so beautiful that I ordered some more for my other windows. I initially ordered both the Aqua and Teal color to try them on at my house. Both of the colors were beautiful. The Aqua version gave more �pop� of the color. Because I was going for a more suttle and serene look, I kept the Teal curtains.Sheers are a difficult product to buy without touching them. A good sheer has enough weight to fall gracefully to the floor while being light enough to dance in a subtle summer breeze. These sheers are exactly that. The fabric is soft and genuine, not cheap like many sheers are. The grommets are well manufactured metal, not plastic like most products. The cut is even and the stitching is quality. I recommend hanging them first and folding them together before steaming the wrinkles out, so that the steam can touch the fabric. There are two sheer panels per packet. I did not know that when purchasing so I purchased double by accident. However, I am so pleased with the quality that I�ve decided to hang onto the extra. I would recommend these in a heartbeat.For anyone trying to choose between the colors natural and white here is a picture of them side by side. White really is a bright white with no other colors. The natural is like a light cream with slubs of brown and grays. The natural was my favorite and these sheer curtains are just what I wanted... no lining and lots of light coming through. I stacked 3 panels on each side on a 90� window to get a very full look, so I ordered a total Qty of 3 since there are 2 panels in each package. Love them!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: REPLACEMENT CANOPY ONLY. MOSQUITO NETTING SET NOT INCLUDED. SOLID PRIVACY CURTAINS NOT INCLUDED. METAL STRUCTURE NOT INCLUDED.. This gazebo was originally sold at Lowes.. This is a REPLACEMENT CANOPY for the Dome 10 x 12 Gazebo.. Color: Beige (may differ from the original).. Manufacturer's model number: GF-12S004B. SKU number: 355094.Seamed a little thin when I placed it on frame. Rain seeped through was very disappointed but didn�t want to take it back off. Sprayed down with a water repellent....which was not that easy reaching the center top but sprayed the underside as well and has done great since then..So you pay $600 or so for a gazebo which you hope would last for a while, not so. First the zippers break then the curtain go. Then the canoy distintegrates. All this in less than two years.If you need curtains Allen Roth will sell you those for a $100 a set. Does not include the mosquito nets or the pillar covers.This canopy is not as well made as you would expect.First the sticthing, several areas were missing stiching and in some only a single side was. The velcro was half swen in some areas. Then there are the holes, yeah it got holes here and there.The seams are not waterproof, you will have to tape them.Comes with warning, that you should remove it in rain, snow, storm extra. Its more to protect them from it being poor quality. The UV rays will disintegrate it In a year so.The fit is not perfect either, the top of the canopy and the bird guard on top don�t match up at all.It takes a couple of hours to install with help including removing the old one. So forget taking it off and on.Shame though the frame has held up well. I wouldn�t mind paying twice if it would last 5 years.this was perfect set was easy looks greatIt's lighter in color than the original so it looked sun bleached out of the box. Material is thin and cheap compared to the original. I was worried at first, now 8 months later I see I was right to be worried. The original lasted 4 years before tearing. I figured $110 every 3-4 years is worth it, but not every 8 months or even a year had it lasted that long. Just ordered one from Apex Garden which claims to be from the original manufacturer and its less expensive so we'll see.

FT.- LW1517IVSM is ideal for cooling large rooms (20' X 40').Best window AC on the market. Would not recommend going any other way. These new inverter models are quiet with no annoying compressor buzzing or clunk when it turns on/off. You can actually be in the same room while you are sleeping in sleep mode. Although I wish they gave you the ability to run it in the sleep mode like state without the timer (like a extra low mode). It's nice to not have to hear anything especially while watching a movie or just wanting peace and quiet. Either way in any of the modes it is quiet but for me the sleep mode is where this unit really shines. I also have the 14,000 btu model LW1517IVSM in the Living Room and it's what got me to purchase this one for my bedroom. The other great thing about these units is there ability to hold the temperature consistent where the other traditional AC turns on/off compressor this one just slows down the speed to maintain the temperature so you don't feel like your freezing 1 minute followed by feeling warm the next. All in all I am very happy and would urge you to try one of these before buying a traditional unit. Also I have no problem with my machines that some people have complained about the whining or high pitched sound. I can hear that from the outside but not inside the rooms which tells me they probably didn't install correctly or sealed properly.If you can fit it in your window . It is THE best thing that can run on 110v. Quiet. Air don�t seem to create much turbulence coming through this unit. Yet it can blow air hard . As well as it has nice �sleep� feature . That function on a timer . If you require ac . But also want to keep it quiet before you fall asleep. Once timer (1-7hrs) expires . Your ac will resume normal operation. Except in my case it switched to saver mode right after. WiFi . I am new to this feature . But few points I have. Are. Other users complained that their router needs to be right next to the unit in order to work. ... yet in my case my iPhone 8+ and my canon printer don�t always catch signal. Yet ac unit works like a Champ . The WiFi turns your phone in to remove control. With virtually unlimited range.( works on cellular network)Also add feature of scheduling your ac run times. Just think of it. If you like to come back to your home and not wait for your place to cool. Yet you don�t wanna run it all day and waste electricity. Problem solved . Before you hit road for your home . Just open mobile app. And tell it to cool place to the desired temp. Not like it�s gonna take long. This thing can put out some crisp air in seconds. If you already know what times you are going to be home . Just set up schedule. Heck if you�re curious how much of an Oven your place is . App will tell you so you don�t come home to personal sauna . Not convinced yet? Oh yeah now I need to mention some cons. Now they aren�t bad. But something some will find annoying. Well you see lg has this theme going on . (With multiple appliances) (my microwave for example.) they make these cheery LOUD beeps . Every time you press a button... or turn them . On... it�s almost like lg is trying to let everyone in house hold . Or neighbor hood know that you have been using your ac or microwave... but that�s about all on that.One slightly weird feature that you will notice with this unit... at first you will think that it�s broken... well when you change your fan speeds it does this gradual spin up... which is nice for keeping people asleep. But a darn ding sound probably already woke them up...coming back to the topic of quietness . When I first powered up . My wife asked me why it�s not working. ... I directed airflow at her and she couldn�t believe that it was actually running... but it really. Prices always change . I�ve scored mine for around 350 bucks... good luck finding anything better for same price.Some people who put comments seem to have only 5 or 1 star... so ones with one star commonly complain how it�s damaged ... blame your mail man. Packaging was solid. Yet to outside appearances it looked like a damn thing was dropped down stare case . Very long one... and probably few times ... yeah there was dent on grill both of condenser and air vent was slightly bent.... nothing that you will ever see inside home. So I can care less . It works better then advertised . It has extra features. It can run very cheap. . . ( warning . Its going to be heaviest thing you are going to lift in a while. But it�s worth it)DO NOT BUY AN LG WINDOW UNIT. HERE IS WHY:Your unit may require service within the LG warranty period. Mine did and my experience with the LG warranty department was positive to a point, but now because of a bad faith action on the part of LG, I am out $578 and have a 100lb paperweight in the middle of my living room floor. The initial troubleshooting call was quick, the service technician was great but had to order a part. By the time the part arrived we were in the middle of the Covid lock down.When I called a month and a half later to reschedule the service tech., I was told they would not be servicing the machine and would give me a refund. It would take about three weeks to receive the check. I purchased a MIDEA U SHAPED UNIT AS A REPLACEMENT, for about the same price. (THE MIDEA IS EXCELLENT: It is about half the size, incredibly quiet compared to any window unit or mini-split I've experienced, secure and weather tight because of the u shape design, and its 12k unit cools much faster and better than LG's 14k unit ever did or the equally high end GE unit before it. Also it is easy to install.)We didn't receive the promised follow up emails from LG or our refund check. We began calling LG's warranty department again. During multiple calls over weeks, we were informed the initial person we spoke to did not complete the required materials or forward them to the appropriate department. We were then shuffled around, had our service order renumbered a few times but also then told the refund was coming. Yesterday, weeks after purchasing a replacement unit and installing it, we were told that LG was no longer going to refund the money but was now going to service the unit. No longer helpful, and in fact hurtful because, on LG's word, we used that money, money we don't otherwise have, to purchase the replacement unit. We live in New Orleans, where a space is not habitable without AC.We were transferred to appeal to a ""supervisor"". Things got weird. It seemed someone kept clicking in to our hold time to see if we were still there. Eventually the supervisor, ""Anthony"" answered. We didn't even have time to address the issue before Anthony started having trouble hearing us. It was not convincing. We believe he was one step short of making static noises with his mouth. Will Ferrell would have done a more convincing job of it in a comedy sketch. Then, though our phone continued to read a connection to LG's 800 number, Anthony transferred us to a wrong number. The wrong number guy stayed on the phone with us for a while and had amazing follow through for a wrong number. We believe he was either Anthony's roommate or a co worker sitting in the same room. So bizarre. Believe me or not.But do believe I'm out close to $600 because LG, in bad faith, did not follow through on the refund. This could easily happen to you.Regardless I highly recommend you check out the new MIDEA U SHAPED AC UNITS. On Amazon they are on back-order but we took a chance and the MIDEA unit arrived in two weeks.My LG serial # 904TAVYFK199nannanPro's:","Pro's:

Text: Experience a cool and relaxing day at home with the hOmelabs portable air conditioner. It cools quietly and is perfect for 300 - 450 square feet room with horizontal window opening. Equipped with an automatic vertical swing function that evenly distributes airflow throughout the room. Our portable AC measures 17.9 x 15 x 30.7 inches and has wheels so it can be easily moved to any room that has a window accessible. Simply attach the hose and the window slide adapter, plug in the power supply and you�re good to go. Most customers are able to install in 8 minutes or less. At the end of a season or when you don�t need it, simply unhook the unit and store in your closet, basement or garage. Keep your air clean and your portable AC running efficiently with the included washable filter. The filter indicator light will illuminate to remind you when to clean the air filter. We recommend you clean the filter approximately once every two weeks. The unit also comes with a remote control to quickly set your desired temperature, fan speed, change cooling modes or activate the eco-friendly sleep featurenanOur downstairs AC went out and we needed an immediate solution for our main floor, which is roughly 1700 sq. ft.. We started with an LG that cost $100 more than this unit (from our local big box hardware store). The LG was pretty and small, but totally wonky to operate. It relied on the remote for controlling the unit (a huge negative in my opinion), and simply didn�t work. It never shut off, even with the timer.We returned it and went with this unit due to the great reviews. Plus it was $100 cheaper and a bit more powerful. We weren�t a fan of the white, but it might be perfect for certain rooms. I wish they offered a darker color... I.e., charcoal,gray.Here are some notes from our experience:- installation was simple. The corrugated tube is long, and I particularly like the way it exits the window insert as a full circle, not a narrowed oval. Its a larger tube than the LG... looks like 6� or so. That should help the efficiency. The tube is a little too flexible though... it will sag to the floor which hurts airflow. The LG had a stiffer tube that held its shape better. The window insert is simple and effective, but we had to cut one piece to make it fit our 32�W window. Kind of surprising, since that�s a common size. But I preferred this to the LG system, which was 4 pieces that were very confusing and left air leaks. I was surprised that there was no grate on the exit side of the tube... to keep bugs and birds out. We bought some window screen and glued it to the outside of the outlet, which worked perfectly.- it�s very quiet... much quieter than the LG. I don�t think it blows as hard as the LG, but it blows hard enough and I prefer quiet over air speed. It keeps our 500 sq. ft. Main room very cool and the rest of the first floor (1700 sq. ft.) plenty comfortable (we use ceiling fans to help move the air around).- IT HAS CONTROLS ON THE UNIT ITSELF. This is simply a must in my opinion. Remotes get lost, break, etc, etc, and I wouldn�t want my AC to become useless if the remote breaks. The LG had only the simplest controls on the unit itself. A negative of the Homelabs system is that when you power up the remote it completely overrides the settings on the unit itself. You kind of have to decide whether you�ll use the remote or the direct buttons... they don�t get along with each other, and the device can get confused if you try to use both (at one point we had to reset the machine because some of the controls weren�t responding after using the remote and the direct buttons together � like most electronics you can reset it by plugging it in while holding the on button down for 3 seconds or so). We favor the direct buttons and don�t use the remote.- the controls are well thought out and function well. The timer can be set for both start up and shut down (the LG could only do one or the other) and it can be set in 30-minute increments (the LG was 60-minutes). The unit will not shut off after the set temperature is reached, which I find odd. The LG was the same. Both units only slow down... perhaps only the fan is running? But I would prefer it if the entire unit shut down when the temperature is reached.- customer service is prompt, pleasant and helpful. We had a shipping issue and they were quick to offer help without hesitation. A definite plus here compared to LG (which has earned a reputation for miserable customer service).All in all were very happy ... it�s a great portable AC and notably better than an LG.UPDATE: we liked it so much we bought a second one... both are running flawlessly every day and have gotten us through the hot southern summer. We�ll get our main HVAC unit fixed in the winter when rates are cheaper.UPDATE 2: when we bought our first one there was maybe 15 reviews... by the second one there was 50 reviews. Now there�s over 300 and it�s still getting great reviews. That says something I think.I thought I�d mention one thing we had to deal with (not a negative, just something to be aware of). We live in Georgia, which can be sweltering hot and humid. If we ran this unit all day we would occasionally see evidence of a small amount of water that had leaked from beneath (we weren�t running it in dehumidify mode). I have to stress this was not a lot of water, and did no damage to our wood floors, but we decided to place the unit on a plastic tray just in case. We used a clear lid from one of those storage bins that we had lying around... worked perfectly, and actually looked like it was part of the device.Still 5 stars for both our devices... they will pay for themselves in the savings we can get from shopping around for AC service in early spring (it�s crazy competitive down here).UPDATE 3: Just bought a third, all working great. Some day we'll get that main HVAC fixed, but no time to think about it nowEdited to add: Using Internet sources for calculating cooling needs, it seems the problem with this unit is inadequate airflow. A 600 square foot room needs airflow of at least 540 CFM. This unit only flows 80 CFM (4.5"" X 5.5"" cold air output; 5.4"" exhaust). Although the BTU rating of 14,000 would be adequate up to 700 sq ft, the minuscule air flow only supports rooms less than 100 sq ft (10 ft by 10 ft). Compare this unit's 80 CFM airflow to window air conditioners with the same BTU rating -- for example, a 14K BTU window AC from GE puts out 470 CFM.Installed in my well-insulated 600 square foot garage with insulated ducting to exhaust the warm air. The drain didn't work properly, so I had to prop up the front end with a 2x4. It ran continuously for 48 hours without getting the air temp below 85 degrees on either Cool or Auto setting. It did remove moisture from the air. After propping up the front, it pushed out 12 to 15 gallons of water in 48 hours. The air temperature at the swinging outlet registers 68 degrees on my laser thermometer after the unit ran a few hours. That isn't nearly cold enough for 600 sq ft. Maybe 100? The merchant wants me to pay return shipping, which is incredible for a defective unit. I don't recommend buying this unit or any portable AC unless you have a very small room to cool.nannanPro's:","Pro's:

Our master bed room is large and can be tricky to cool down at the end of day with the west sun beating on the windows. This Airemax was perfect. It comes with all the parts to set it up quickly and easily. Vented it right out a side window with all the included parts. Manuals detail walked us right through the process. With the remote and the programming capabilities we can adjust as needed and also program to kick on before we get home from work. Digital display is very easy to read. With this humidity ion the air lately we also like the fact that it will continue to dehumidify as needed.I would highly recommend this unit.I have no idea why warmth and thickness would apply to a room air conditioner! But I LOVE this for my home office. Since COVID 19, I�ve had to convert a spare room to an office. The spare room gets all day AZ sun and even with insulation over the windows and room darkening drapes, the room got really warm! The remote is right by my keyboard so one touch of the button will cool off the room in a jiffy. Ice cold!Easy install, noise level not too bad. Unit has kept the space cool in triple digit heatwave in the desert ???. Did not have a screen to cover the outside exhaust. Bugs get inside unit. I had to fabracate a screen cover to fit the unit. Also like two washable filters. This should come with purchase. Would recommend to others.Saved me, installed in 100 degree weather, room temp 95 degrees, bearable within 2 hours, keeping 500 square feet 78 degrees in 100+ days.Maybe I'll change this after talking to customer service tomorrow but for now it's one star. I recieved this product today. Took it out of the box, set everything up as specified, waited 2 hours as the instructions say. When I turned it on I could hear the compressor kick it but it's not blowing cold air at all. I've let it run for an hour and nothing. Just room temperature air.

Text: Gorgeous 14x18 wall hanging picture frame with double warm white mat opening for an 11x14 image. Bold 1.5 inch frame profile and flex tab back opening allowing you to easily add and remove photos or art. Frame includes durable d-ring hangers on the back for vertical or horizontal hanging options. Specialty Frame Type: Floater Frame. Frame profile is crafted from solid wood in an elegant walnut finish. Lightweight protective glass will keep your favorite photos looking great for yearsWell packed for shipping. Was expecting white matting but was more ecru. Didn�t impact my project as much but would have preferred white. Frames were sturdy and well colored. Was a great match to the cherry furniture and gave me the finished look I was hoping to achieve. I ordered 3 for my project and they all were the same look and quality. A little over zealous with the tacks in the back but not a negative. Overall very pleased.The frame is nice enough. The latching portions on the back are lacking at the bottom of the frame and it's a bit flimsy in that section. The worst thing is someone had to put a big sticker on the glass and it's impossible to get off easily. I had to spend over a half hour scrubbing it off with rubbing alcohol. Totally unnecessary to put a sticker on the glass. Frustrating!!!!Normally I wouldn't write a review. It's a picture frame. It frames pictures. But I saw so many negative reviews I figured I'd balance it out. I experienced none of the problems the others had written about. No sticker on glass. No shoddy packaging. No damage to the corners. Nothing looks cheap. It's glass not plexi. It's exactly what I was looking for. I'm 100% satisfied.This frame suited my purposes quite well. I did however mistake the parts for hanging the frame as trash since they looked like odd pieces of plastic that were perhaps meant to help with packaging? I didn't know what they were for and my daughter tossed them before I figured out that they were to actually hang the frame. No worries, I just used other methods for hanging. In the end, it looks great on my wall.This is a beautiful frame. Has a nice weight to it and seems very sturdy. Also it was very well packaged so it arrived in perfect shape. Would definitely order this one again.Pro's:","Pro's:

Each frame is made of MDF wood with plastic styrene front to prevent breakage. Frames include pre-attached saw tooth hangers for vertical or horizontal wall hanging. Easy to open turn buttons make adding your photograph a breezenanThese are perfect frames. I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color.

Text: OUTPERFORMS FIBERGLASS, WASHABLE AND NON-ELECTROSTATIC 3-month pleated 1 in. home air filters for your furnace, air conditioner or HVAC system. DESIGNED WITH EXCLUSIVE Filtrete Brand 3-in-1 technology from 3M to trap unwanted air particles while letting cleaner air flow through. ATTRACTS AND CAPTURES microscopic particles such as smoke, cough and sneeze debris, bacteria and viruses--and large particles, including lint, household dust and pollen. 1900 MPR has a rating of MERV 13. The higher the MPR, the more microparticles--such as pollen, pet dander, smoke, bacteria and viruses--your filter will capture from the air passing through it. 62% SMALL PARTICLE CAPTURE, like bacteria and particles that carry viruses ( % captured is based on ASHRAE 52.2 testing for 0.3 to 1 micron particles from the air passing through the filter, which relates to HVAC industry standard efficiency testing). CERTIFIED as asthma & allergy friendly (As outlined in report ASCR: 1246-01)I've tested a LOT of filters over the years for shop air filtration systems. THIS filter is the only one that gives very low flow resistance (lower than most MERV 8 filters) but, at the same time, it offers 94% filtration efficiency for particles > 0.5 microns. The secret is that this filter has about 2x as many pleats as every other filter I've tested so it has about the same filtration area as a 4"" filter. That's how it gives the best of both worlds... low flow resistance like the cheap fiberglass filters and high filtration efficiency (MERV13) at the same time.I won't use any other filter from now on. Kudos to the 3M engineers who put this one together.Okay I can't speak to how these will work in your air conditioner because I am using them to create pseudo virus masks out of them. This 1900 series supposedly has virus protection so with the current lack of access to masks I have created a cloth mask with a pouch and I took the filter apart and cut 2 pieces of filter (one on top of the other) that fit into the pouch. I realize it's not ideal but desperate times call for desperate measures. Wire mesh was easier than most to get off because it sits on top of the pleats instead of some other filters where the wire mesh goes up and down in the pleats. Hopefully these are okay to have close to your face. There are no warnings on the package regarding handling so I guess they are okay.We settled on the 1900 rating about ten years ago in the 3m Filtrete line, back when they were called ""Ultimate Allergen."" Around five years ago the marketing branding became ""Healthy Living,"" at the same 1900 rating. The product we just received continues that branding, but we have noticed a significant decline in quality. All three filter versions dating back to 2009 have been made in Mexico. Our earliest example had full color markings, a thick protective paper, and each filter in a six pack was individually sealed in clear wrap. Although the packaging is discarded, it was a clue that made me examine the filter quality itself. Sure enough, the one from five years ago had begun using thinner cardboard around the frame of the paper filter media, and the packaging was less colorful and no longer had the protective inside paper beneath the outer clear wrap. The latest example that just arrived has stiff paper as an outer frame, which makes the entire filter feel more flimsy. No longer is the six-pack of filters individually wrapped, just one outer clear wrap and no protective paper between that and the filter paper (this helps keep the pleated paper from getting crushed by packing pressure). When we next install one of these newest ones, if the pressure from the air handler bends, distorts or otherwise causes leaks around the pleated paper, we shall complain and return the remainder. For this money I expect the quality to be maintained.Excellent filter. I work in HVAC and work with multiple types of filters. In my opinion this is the best you can buy in the 1 inch category.It fits snuggly into the filter grills, not allowing any air to pass on the sides. Not so snuggly you have to squish it to get it into place though. It doesn�t bounce up and down as the system fan cycles. The extra pleats allow for a significantly lower static pressure which preserves the life of the blower motor but also allows for greater airflow while still filtering properly.We recently had a rain storm and my roof caved in. The filter turned completely black. I thought this was due to the excess moisture in the air, but turned out when the roof came in I had a lot of black mold. I believe the blackness in the filter was actually the mold spores. I�ve never seen a filter go black within a couple of hours before.I change my filter every 2 months, and my fan cycles for about 30 min. every hour. This helps clean the air in the home in a big way. Combine this with an Air Scrubber which uses a mixture of UV light and a honeycomb matrix, and you will have hospital quality air, as well as a very sanitized home.The investment is high with these filters, but replacing your HVAC system is even higher, I very much recommend these amazing filters and will use nothing less until I switch to a 5 inch filter solution.Filtrete Healthy Living Ultimate Allergen Reduction Filter, MPR 1900 filters are better quality filters that offer a good balance between filtering small particles and not restricting airflow. On my system, MPR 1900 seems to be the filtration limit before I notice my system having to work harder. These filters trap dust, bacteria, germs, viruses and allergens. They're rated to last up to 3 months, but I can stretch them a little bit longer. Filtrete Healthy Living Ultimate Allergen Reduction Filter MPR 1900 filters aren't the cheapest filters, nor are they the most expensive. For the price, they perform excellently. I recommend them.One other note. After reading many other reviews, there have been issues with people receiving the wrong filters, bulk filters, or filters without any labeling. I ordered the 2-Pack that was sold and shipped by Amazon. I received a shrink wrapped, correctly labeled, retail package as shown in the attached photo.Pro's:","Pro's:

Easy operation, it takes you 30 seconds to hang up your poster. Also, replace other posters as you like without damaging. Kindly note that the magnetic hanger may not suitable for thick posters as it will affect the magnetThese hanging frames are great! I used them for some vintage prints I bought locally. I searched around and this was the cheapest I found. These magnets are STRONG! Like, incredibly strong. My finger got pinched in it several times so it�s a little tricky to get the print in there perfectly straight but I�m very pleasedThis frame exceeded my expectations- for the price I was expecting the frame it be thin and cheap looking, which I was ok with. However it wasn�t. It looks beautiful and it is thick. The string that holds it up is securely in place and has a nice thickness to it. The magnetic work smoothly. I can�t really attest to the functionality unfortunately my dog destroyed it after the cat knocked of the table the day I got it (of happened while I was in school). It�s such a shame, I was so excited to get this and it was such a wonderful frame - I�m more upset than I should be. Maybe in the furture I can get a new one and write a better review, but I won�t be able to afford for awhile.*the dog is okay - he didn�t ingest any magnets thanks to the protective taping over it...thank god for that!Great little frame, and priced right. I had a 24x24 picture, and it�s ridiculously difficult to find a nice frame that size without going custom. I wanted something nicer, and not a black poster frame to go with the theme of the room.Looks nice, hangs nice. My only critique, and it�s a small one, is that it�s tough to line up perfectly. My picture has small decorative lines along the border, so if it wasn�t perfect, you could easily tell. Once I managed to get it lined up and the picture laying flat, it was perfect.Great for old sized pictures like mine.I started doing the 5d diamond painting and needed an inexpensive way to frame some pieces that are oddly sized. These are the perfect solution! They are easy to use, and look really good on the finished product.I printed out a photo to a 20x30 size for one reason - to cover the ugly electric panel box in our condo. This magnetic frame is perfect for just that! It isn't overly obtrusive in case we need to get into the panel. We have it hanging from two wall hooks and we can easily remove the photo.We have two photos in the frame to change things up a bit by simply flipping it over. We tried three, but that seemed to be a bit of a stretch - magnets didn't hold so well. But two, for sure!Pro's:","Pro's:

Single Table Top Dimensions: 47.25"" W x 23.5"" D. Assembly required.Perfect for our space and needs.My 3 year old and I do alot of crafting so I needed up upgrade our space to allow us to work side by side.Assembly was pretty easy, but time consuming (1.30hours). Everything went together easily. I will say that some parts had minor flaws (small chip, part not perfectly aligned) but these things you wouldn't notice unless you nitpicked. I also put one tie in the middle to make the bars more flush. You can also see the thickness of material here, in the listing it seems very thin when it's actually not.This desk is very sturdy, and very appealing. It was also very easy to install a pegboard to the back for our supplies. Truly it's just perfect. Especially since the nearest comparison by tribaldesigns is 250 and this is priced at 145. Really really happy I saved money and received an excellent desk!I bought this for me and my boyfriend. We liked the idea of sitting side by side while gaming or just using the computer in general as we're frequently on it. The desk was easy to assemble, took a few hours. When the desks aren't attached they are a tad wobbly by themselves. Once they're secured together the setup is pretty solid. The overall appearance of the desk is really nice, it looks like it's worth way more than it actually is. I've received many compliments by family when they've seen it. There's plenty of space for each person on their side of the desk for whatever they want. The top shelf is a nice feature too and deep enough to fit many kinds of things. Overall, very pleased with this desk and I would recommend it to any couple or family on a budget.It was easy to put together. I put it together by myself in about 45 minutes. More than enough space for my two children to use for school. Shelving allows them to keep all of their school materials in close reach. It can be separated into two individual desks by simply removing a couple of screws that are easy to reach. Delivered in two boxes. Put the bottom together first, it goes a lot faster.The only thing wrong was that there was a indent inside of one of the metal poles that wouldn�t allow a screw to go inside however it wasn�t a super important piece for us to have to replace it. It�s perfect for a gaming table and art table. Very easy to assemble with one person but I recommend two people for lifting. If you�re putting this in a tight space put the desks separate and then connect them or just keep separatePro's:","Pro's: 
-Flexible and can be used as two seperate desks
-Large working surface
-Ample storage space
-Durable material
Con's: 
-Some parts had minor flaws
-Can be wobbly if not attached together",26

Smooth taste and texture, just blend or shake with water or your choice of beverage post workout � or even add some fruit to make a tasty protein packed smoothieThese people fear mongering �heavy metals� should take the 30 seconds to study the subject. Those substances are in every plant you�ve ever eaten in your life, and because this product is made by people who respect your body, it has retained the minerals found naturally in the same plants. Further, that Clean Label study has been butchered by the scientific community as disingenuous for these same reasons.Yes, this product has the most of those plant materials, because it is in fact the purest plant product. If you want Whey go get it.I hardly write reviews, but when i saw all the complaints about the metals I just have to say.,,, Stop it people!! For all of those on a plant based diet you should know that one of the first things you have to realize is that heavy metals are naturally present in soil and water which logically means there are going to be certain amounts of it in most fruits, vegetables and tap water . So let me say this, METALS ARE NOT ADDED TO PROTEIN POWDERS but they are absorbed from the soil by whatever plant source is being utilized to create the product,. Start doing your own research and you will discover what organization started this entire fear mongering about metals in plant based supplements and why they did so and if you want to continue to complain, then you might as well continue and stop eating, vegetables and fruit and a whole list of other foods that will take up to much space in this review . In closing, I experiment with different plant based brand protein powder supplements and this Vega is fantastic. Grainy or not grainy just depends on how you make it. Sweet or not sweet once again depends on how you mix it i.e with water or milk or fruit etc. I keep mine simple, about 85% water with a top off of Flaxseed milk. Absolutely delicious!!!!I have been purchasing Vega's Vanilla Protein for a little over half a year now. I loved the nutritional label and how 'clean' the ingredients were. Unfortunately I have come to find out Vega was tested as one of the worst brands polluted with toxic metals and other contaminants. They declined to comment on the study, which further confirmed my suspicion. I will no longer be repurchasing. If you also care about ingesting these heavy metals . . . you shouldn't either.I like it, I use it. Read the label if you like it buy it for yourselfThis has a really distinct flavor to it. I did COUNTLESS hours of research on protein powders because I�m a breastfeeding mom to a daughter with a dairy allergy. If I have dairy, my daughter is throwing up 30 hours later. I ended up choosing a vegan protein because I was nervous about all the whey isolates even though �lactose free� they�re really just adding in the lactase enzyme. It�s great. Noticeable muscle tone and added weight. I�m 5�4 and was 113 lbs when beginning, about 1 month later I�m 118 lbs and my body is looking more athletic as desired. Personally the flavor and texture is much more enjoyable in a smoothie. I do 1 scoop chocolate protein, 2 TBs peanut butter powder, 3/4 cup almond milk, 3/4 cup water, and half a frozen banana. I look forward to it in the mornings after working out.Pro's:","Pro's:

You�re still getting all the servings listed on your product.A very filling meal. I mix one scoop with one glass (1-2 cups) of water. Most negative reviews are because of the taste, however, this depends on people. My first Vega product was the vanilla one, which is delicious. Going from that to this is a shock, but if you're committed to not using Splenda or artificial flavorings, after the first 2-5 drinks you will honestly develop a taste for it. I have a glass every afternoon as part of my new lifestyle and I'm losing weight and staying fit.It blends perfectly. The trick is to fill the cup with water first, then put in the powder, and stir. If it doesn't mix well, you're probably not using enough water. As a chemist, I have a habit of using as little solvent as possible and then bring to volume, but that doesn't work here. Also, the powder is light as heck and staticy, so it tends to get everywhere when you scoop it out. It would be nice if a future formula or container didn't do this, but it's a minor complaint and worth dealing with given how good the product is.I don't know of any studies that have demonstrated the quality of the ingredients, but all I can say is I drink a glass every afternoon as part of my new healthy lifestyle and I've been losing fat, while keeping my muscle mass. I like having protein from vegetables, because too much protein form meat can give you kidney problems, which I actually was just diagnosed with last week.I�m don�t ever leave reviews but I�m really disappointed with this new formula... I�ve been having the chocolate protein for breakfast everyday for the last 8 to 10 months and it was the best tasting protein I�ve ever had. I just recieved my usual order of 3 tubs and right away noticed a difference with the color. The old formula is much darker and looks more like chocolate (top cup in the picture). The usual taste isn�t really there, it tastes too artificial now. Don�t know what protein to use now :/I�ve tried both the vanilla and berry flavored protein. The vanilla is average, but the berry is the perfect additional flavor I�ve been looking for in my post-workout smoothies. I use frozen berries + spinach + coconut milk + one scoop of the berry powder. I think it�s funny that some people complain that the powder tastes �planty� because like... OBVIOUSLY! It�s a plant based protein, haha. It doesn�t bother me personally, but if it did, it�s still worth sacrificing the sugary whey protein powders that �taste� better for one that is healthier. Otherwise it�s counter-active. Overall, this is one of the best budget protein powders I�ve tried. Forget Shakeology or Arbonne. That stuff is ridiculously overpriced. I also have a very sensitive stomach (dairy and gluten free) for anyone concerned about that, and this powder doesn�t bother me one bit. Definitely recommend!Since I prefer not to rot my teeth with sugar-filled concoctions or spike my blood sugar and promote insulin resistance with artificial sweeteners, I thought I would never find an unsweetened protein powder that I could choke down comfortably without needing to disguise the taste...until now!Pros:- Dissolves readily- Smooth texture relative to other plant based proteins- Extremely neutral flavor - neutral enough to use this as if it were a nondairy milk. I'm talking less glecchy than soy or almond, which is saying a lot.- If you do need to disguise it, it blends easily with any other fruits, flavorings etc. I usually drink this plain, or with half a scoop of chai tea latte mix if I want some flavor.Cons:- ...- High in sodium I guess?- Separates easily so you'll need your shaker bottle.I just wish it came in a container that had less of an impact on plastics use :(Note: I picked this particular brand because my stomach can't handle gluten or whey. I do supplement my diet with some animal protein, though.When the package arrived I was concerned about puncture holes at the top in the shape of a star and asked via email if it was possible it was tampered. I received no response. I decided it might be okay so I tried it. After I drank it my tongue got numb. It tasted like artificial sugars in it or maybe it was bad. I am not sure. I would like to return it but I think it is too late and I used a scoop. I would not recommend this partly to the lack of response as well as the taste and my reaction. I am very disappointed in all of he above. I have used many other protein powders but never has such a reaction.Pro's:","Pro's:

If there are any problems about our 2 person storage desk, please contact us directly, we will reply and offer a solution in 24 hoursThe directions were very short and brief but it was very easy to put together. It�s exactly what I was hoping for. I love it, it�s perfect!I love this desk. My husband and I put it together in a little over an hour. Best to have two people for ease of the process. This desk is perfect for my needs. One end holds my laptop and the other is for my crafts. It is room enough to add extra cubbies for storage underneath. This desk is sturdy but lightweight enough that I can move it alone for cleaning the baseboards and floor. I would definitely purchase this item again!Putting this together was a good experience. It's stable, the connecting pieces are strong, the particle board doesn't feel hollow, and the desk surface, which comes in two parts, has a wood grain that matches up if you orient them to do so. Most of the parts are reversible or can otherwise be interchanged with the matching part on the other side. When complete, it felt very stable.The ONLY PROBLEM I had was that the hex tool used to tighten just about every screw and bolt, of which there are a few dozen, was made of some really soft metal and lasted for about eight. Fortunately I had my own, but if I hadn't, I would have been expecting to have a desk later that day and not have that desk when I needed or expected it. That's almost worse than not having received it at all.This table is awesome! My husband and I were looking for a 2 person table that did not take up so much space. This table was perfect. We were able to fit a printer in the Center.I like how light this is. It took me about 2.5 hours to assemble because I did it myself. It looks small and heavy from the pictures when ordering but after completion, it was amazingly lightweight and very spacious for my needs. I am using clear floor mats and desk mats to protect the tile floors from the legs of this table and chairs while protecting the top from heavy use.Pro's:","Pro's:

Careful to just to a little at a time.My piercing was swollen and seemingly getting infected. As a last resort I thought let me try a hoop and in real gold so that I minimize rejection and infection.Within two days the swelling was completely gone and I�ve gotten used to having a hoop in my nose. I feel edgy and artsy.I know it�s real gold as I�ve had no reaction to the metal. It is easily bent and I even squeezed it a little more to make the hoop size more to my liking.This is exactly what I was looking for! I tried ordering this type of nose ring through a very popular website and I was sent a gold filled nose ring from two different vendors. I knew it wasn�t solid gold because I had a reaction to the metal. I decided on whim to check Amazon for a solid gold nose ring and got my nose ring with Prime shipping! Weeks later, and I haven�t experienced any allergic reaction - so this item is as described! I love it!I got this nose ring yesterday and it�s only been 24 hours since i put it on and my keloid is almost completely gone. I have been switch and bought so many nose rings thinking it will resolve the keloid issue but nothing helped! This one finally worked. Granted it�s only been 1 day but it already looks better then it ever has! Thank you! I notice they are a store from Hawaii! And i love it since that is home for me!I love that this is real gold. My nose is super irritated by fake jewelry and this was an easy purchase and a smart purchase. Great valueI absolutely love this nose ring. I haven't had any issues with snagging or irritation.

I hope when I take it out, it does not snap -- the metal is pretty pliable/soft. Very satisfied.It's so teeny and cute. I was worried it might be a little snug or look silly, but it's great.

These drapes were so inexpensive, I was trying to brace myself to be disappointed but, as an internal optimist, decided to give them a shot. Great buy! They are good quality, and are a good thickness for regular, non blackout drapes. They also arrived very quickly. I got these in ivory and 108� for decorative purposes not coverage, but I think they would help with some light coverage for someone looking for that. I�d recommend buying extra to bunch them up for more coverage seeking people. It would look better than pulling them tightly anyway - double win. The wrinkles from packaging fell out pretty quickly and I helped it along by taking the cover off my steam mop head and waving it close by for a few minutes. Not sure if that�s recommended, so proceed with caution, but it worked out great for me. The only reason I didn�t give these 5 stars is because there was a slight bunching on one of the drape panels. It doesn�t bother me because the look is light and flowy, not starched and pressed. It�ll probably fall out with time, but I figured that might bother some.

Depends on my mood in the next couple days, Whether I keep it or not I�m sure.

My thermo says the water temp is 71...the device says 74. Ok...sooooo I finally got it to start heating though...I turned it up to %88 and the heating element finally is getting warm now.These heaters are trash. Haven�t been 2-1/2 months and they don�t work. We have them set at 78 however they will allow temp to drop to 70 before ever coming on. That is almost a 10 degree swing and it unacceptable. This happens even know the internal thermostat on them show the temperature is way out of parameters. If you set digital thermostat to any thing else the heaters don�t shut off until 92. Run away from there or will kill everything. They did work well for a few days. So if you have them already test them often.This heater kept my fish and plants alive in the galvanized tank outside through single digit temperatures.

The fish were active and happy throughout the storm. This thing is amazingFinally, a digital heater! I hate the glass heaters with the little knob you have to turn and try to get the temperature where you want it. I saw this and figured I'd give it a try.

For instance, mine were falling apart straight out of the box-- literally, when I opened the first frame, it was in 3 pieces...I pushed them back together but you can still tell at the corners (see photo) that they're not quite together. Nothing a little glue and bracing won't fix but I wasn't planning on having to glue together a brand new item. There's also a crack in the plastic (hope you weren't expecting glass). Frames are expensive so I wasn't expecting much but what I got is a little less than what was expected.These would�ve been great if they hadn�t been too small .Nice frames. Thought the mat was a different size but they will workBeautiful actual wood frames but not superior quality. Definitely worth it though considering other frames are way more expensive.They work for what I needed it for. Not glass in the frame, it's a plastic film that has scratches. The corners were separating as soon an I unpacked them. Made them work but was disappointed.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Lightweight and strong
-Can be hung together or separately
-Easy to open and load pictures
-Inexpensive
Con's: 
-Corners were separating upon arrival
-Not glass, plastic film that scratches easily",25

If you have any question for quality or dimension, just feel free to contact us,we will reply you in earliest time.The Voova laptop sleeve is good looking and efficient. It fits my 17.3 HP laptop perfectly and has a side pocket for the power cord and bluetooth mouse. It would also probably fit a bluetooth keyboard if needed. The sleeve is not too heavy or bulky and the shoulder strap is easy to remove and put on.I would recommend the Voova laptop sleeve shoulder bag to anyone.Seems very well made and padding is adequate. I wanted a bag with a zippered exterior pocket to hold a wireless mouse and this also has another pocket with a velcro closure. Also has handles and a nice shoulder strap. For the price it is just perfect for my 14"" Chromebook. If you need more storage compartments or have a larger laptop/Chromebook then this is not the bag for you. I usually also travel with a backpack, so this will normally be carried with other stuff (my lunch, a real book, pens, extra glasses, hat, gloves, phone, etc), so it is protected while in the backpack.So far so good. Interior has decent padding. Zip front pouch is kind of small, however it holds my power cords , the shoulder strap, & my portable 6�x 6�x1� cd drive & cord. I�m keeping the portable wireless mouse inside the main compartment. The back also has Velcro pouch for papers or other items. Holds my HP 15.6� laptop with still some room to spare. I think it will serve it�s purpose well.The bag will work fine for what I need it for. It doesnt expand very well. Things proteude when stored in the side pockets. Looks odd but will function fine. Wont be able to take to many additional things with you in the bag. Will hold your laptop, notepad, external hard drive, charging cable and a small mouse. Anything other than that, you are pushing it. But over all, if I carried anything larger, i would probably stuff ot with things I dont really need. Would recommend.UPDATE: I finally received my laptop carry case! Shipper's fault - not Voova! It came well packaged. Upon opening, the color stuck me: I got the purple & it was as it appeared in the ad - it's beautiful! The construction is sturdy; the lining ultra-soft. My HP 17.3"" fit snug as a bug; and there was room enough at the top to fit in the 2 pieces of the charging cord, and could zip it with no problem. There's pockets inside the front zippered pouch for a mouse, and extras; and room in the back pouch for a pad of paper. Haven't traveled with it yet, but fully loaded, it's still very slim. Great design! Well thought out! Would most definitely recommend it!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Nominal size: 16x20x1; Actual size 15 3/4""x 19 3/4"" x 3/4""; This MERV 8 filter is comparable with MPR 600 & FPR 5.. Designed to filter microscopic particles such as lint, dust mites, spores, and pollen. Simple to install and a cost-effective step towards a healthier home environment. For best results, change your filters every 60 to 90 days but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months. 100% synthetic electrostatic media for high efficiency with low air flow resistance. Manufactured in the USA by Filtration Group, a world-leading manufacturer and supplier of filtration solutions making the world safer, healthier & more productiveThese filters have cost me a lot of money! I ordered these a while back 4 1/2 months ago to be exact. I started using them 2 months ago. I came home 7 weeks ago to a very hot house. Went out and the A/C was frozen up. I unthawed it and called a A/C company to figure out what was going on. Everything checked out. Went 2 weeks with cooler weather and everything was great. It got hot again and it froze up again. I called a different company and everything was fine. A total of 4 companies and over $700 in service call fees I finally figured it out on my own. It was frozen up and I let it unthaw again and took out the filter and put back in a cheap one and have had no problems. I�ve called 2 of the companies and met them to show them the filters and they said to never purchase again. It wasn�t allowing air to flow because they were to thick and are not made of materials to filter. Smh. Amazon should refund me every dollar with the money they make ripping people off with such junk.I ordered these for the first time in 16x20x1 in a 4 pack.Cons: I was surprised they weren't individually wrapped in plastic.Pros: These are ""cheap"" filters, but that's exactly what I wanted. If i order allergen rated high filtration filters, my old furnace just overheats and shuts off due to air flow restriction. These seem good so far.Sizing:The biggest complaint I saw from others on these filters is that they're not a literal size. Meaning a 16x20x1 filter isn't LITERALLY 16 inches x 20 inches x 1 inch.I replaced a 16x20x1 from another brand with this. It was the same size as the other 6 companies I bought from. They're all the same (correct) size. Granted I haven't ordered every size this company makes, but what I ordered was the size that I expected, and the same size you'd get from every other brand.Basically, the people complaining that they're not the right size probably have no idea what size their furnace needs. Look at the older filter label, order that size. Job done.I am a medical facility operations advisor filters that are not stamped with a ""A"" rating like MERV 13A or MERV 9A will loose the rating quickly so a MERV 13 might become a MERV 11 after 30 days.With large air handlers you have ""pre, intermediate, final, and last stop HEPA"" those HEPAs get those tiny buggers like TB.So with standard home filters best to change every 30 days so you don't plug up ypur evaporator.Or if you can get into your air handler unit (AHU) wash your evaporator every year like your condenser outside.Hope not too deep I really could have gone alot deeper.My daughter is allergic to so many airborne things, including cat dander (we have four). Since switching to these filters (instead of the 3M allergen ones we'd been using) she hasn't had to use an inhaler! Yes, she takes a daily dose of Zyrtec, but she started doing that long before we switched filters and still needed daily puffs. Besides eliminating my daughter's need for an inhaler, I *know* these filters work better just by looking at them because they catch SO MUCH MORE junk. There were times when we went three months without changing a 3M filter, and even then, they didn't have as much junk on them as one of these Aerostar filters catches in one month. Seriously, give these filters a try! You have nothing to lose because they're a lot less expensive. The only downsides are: a) You will have to change these more frequently because they work SO much better. b) For some reason, they aren't sized exactly as labeled--about 1/4 inch shorter both width and lengthwise. However, they're still less expensive than other brands that don't work as well, even if you use one a month, and the size issue isn't really an issue unless you sleep right next to your furnace (because there might be a slight noise when your air starts and stops since these run small). Our furnace is in the basement, so we never hear it.Terrific product, especially when compared to what's available at the big box stores. The only negative I've seen is that I have to change them more frequently.I live in Colorado, and we've been having more forest fires lately. In the past, fires have been noticeable indoors by the smell. With these filters, I don't notice that smell, and I hope that means I'm getting less junk in my lungs.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Reduces allergens
-Eliminates the need for an inhaler
-Catches a lot of junk

Ideal for healthy, on the go nutrition for men, women, and kids. These are great for meal replacement, smoothie boosters, muscle recovery, and pre or post workoutsI just started drinking this powder a few days ago and my motto is if it tastes like crap it looks great on the body and if it tastes great well it doesn't usually look so great on the body which is why I bought this to begin with. I didn't want to mix it in my morning coffee that's how my son drinks it. Yuck! But I decided to just mix a scoop in some cold water and just stir it up and drink it and don't worry about the taste. Well I did that for 5 mornings this week and to my surprise by the 3rd day I had lost my taste for sugar and cravings! I was really surprised but that's the side affect for drinking this stuff?? I have lost a pound and I've been working out and my energy is like the energizer bunny! It's crazy as I am a almost 5 year stroke survivor working on getting my energy back up. About the taste once I get past the first sip I can drink the rest and it taste pretty good. I ordered myself a blender that I can't wait to try so I will come back and update this review next week!?? I say treat your body good and it will feel amazing ??First of all...I've tried other Vegan protein powders before--I've used to take one that was made from mushrooms and that one was fine. This one, however, tastes so bad I actually almost vomited (I have a pretty strong stomach, only been nauseous a few times in my life so this was awful). I hadn't done enough research on this, and once I looked back at the poor ratings of this protein powder more extensively, and a lot of people had a similar reaction, along with stomach bloating, which I haven't noticed, but I've only used it twice so far, but I'm not sure I'll be able to do that again.I also saw the Clean Label Project mentioned on another Vegan Protein Powder review and realized I didn't check this before I bought this. This protein powder only has a 2 out of 5 stars because of the presence of Arsenic/Mercury and Cadmium/Lead which is terrifying to me. Definitely not buying this again!!!!I've been using this for about a year. I have tried about everything out there andfor the money...and being plant based...in my opinion it's right up there withthe top name brands; for a lot less cost. I mix it with Organic raspberries, blueberries, 1/2 ofbanana, Green Vibrance and self ground Flax Seed; plus some high potency mutli vitamins withminerals and Ubiqunol. I usually am never tired and have energy that keeps me going untilfairly late at night.I'm going to be 70 and something has to be helping me and I believe it isthis regiment. Good luck and God BlessIn brief: Do some more research on alternative vegan protein options before concluding on Orgain.This is my 2nd vegan protein powder, and I ignorantly bought it without doing much research besides relying on the fact that it's a best seller item and has somewhat decent reviews.1) My goal for buying was to take after the gym. I don't think it's meant for that (even though it says it's for athletes, among others) and seems to be geared more towards meal replacement due to the ingredients meant to have an effect on appetite. There's not even an amino acid profile on the packaging which is something I'd actually like to have.2) It tastes markedly better than my first vegan brand (Sunwarrior Warrior Blend which tastes awful), but other reviewers seem to not like the taste - I got vanilla. Maybe after forcing down a terrible flavor for so long, a less-bad flavor is much less noticeable to me.3) Aside from flavor, however, it made my stomach hurt pretty badly within and hour of taking it. It doesn't appear that my experience is completely unique among customers. I wasn't sure whether it was this or something else until I tried 2 more times and experienced the same issue on both occasions. The first time was the worst time though. Further research on ingredients pulled up:- Organic Acacia Gum: Thickener extracted from the acacia tree, it also provides fiber to help suppress appetite. Possible side effects which may result include: A) Nausea, gas, and bloating. B) Loose stools, diarrhea, and indigestion.- Organic Erythritol: A sugar alcohol used as an alternative sweetener. It is only partially absorbed by the body and contains almost no calories. It can promote side effects such as: A) Indigestion, bloating, and stomach rumbling. B) Nausea, intestinal gas, and ill feelings.- Organic Guar Gum: A fiber and thickener that is extracted from the guar plant. It is sometimes used as a laxative, and it can cause an expansion in the intestines to mimic fullness.Among other things. I have experienced the above side effects all three times, and it's pretty irritating. I don't even think that I can return it now - so it's a waste of money on top.I just found a dead bug & a piece of plastic in the same scoop of my protein powder. I received this box two days ago. I am shocked, baffled & disappointedly this used to be my go-to protein powder. Now I gag thinking about it. What am I supposed to do with the rest of this bucket now? Ugh. Gross. Don�t get it.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanGreat premise. Frustrating storytelling and scripting. I love Templesmith's art, aside from some distractingly weak figure drawing (suddenly an adult character's arms shrink to child-size), it's richly textured, nightmarish and fluid. He even depicts action and movement within a panel, something paint-heavy comics artists seem to have trouble with. However, there are times where it's a misleading, inaccurate mess. The main example of this, we have vampires appear amongst normal people in an enclosed space. For several pages, there are terrified faces, gore-dripping fangs and bloodlike splatters all over the place. Then, pages later, the text tells us ""thank goodness no one was hurt and everyone got out alright"". WHAT? That's not what I saw. Totally threw me off. So, I see this as illustration, NOT graphic storytelling. Gorgeous, effectively-stylized pictures, lovingly reproduced here (of such high quality you can see where paint and images were layered). But, all too often, they do not tell a clear story (there are incredibly effective exceptions, though!) Steve Niles' dialogue... well, I often find it cumbersome. I have trouble ""hearing"" it. Especially in the first two books contained here. As for the script/narrative. when we come to the second ""book"" contained here, a year's time seems incredibly unbelievable for a character to accomplish and undergo the radical changes the protagonist demonstrates. Having it occur over a more realistic period of time wouldn't have hurt the premise at all. Having said all this I do feel I can recommend this with reservations, especially since I feel the paperback is very reasonably priced given the quality of the printing. It's just not as good as I feel it could have been (which, with the art, can be partially down for originally needing to meet a monthly print schedule in the original format).This is a great story, the artwork is not my style but the downfall of this book is how awful it is made. Once you get about halfway through the story it will like so many other reviews say start falling apart on you. The glue they use in the binding is terrible. I have comics this thick and thicker that are 15-20 years old that don't fall apart. My Walking Dead Conpendiums are three times as thick of these and have been read multiple times and are still together.Good story, dreadful edition.Began disassembling itself instantly upon reading attempt.Useless for retention in library.Highly dissatisfied.This review deals with nothing about the contents of the book (story, characters, themes, art) it has everything to do with the quality of the binding. The binding on this book is so terrible that before I could even get through the first portion of the book, it had fallen out, and as I continued to read page after page and section after section fell out. The binding of this book is absolute garbage. PLEASE BE ADVISEDReally enjoyed the story and the art. Didn�t have any binding issues, but the page sizes are just really small. It�s a smaller page than most trade paperbacks. You could even call it undersized, which is a shame because the art is very nice.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanSecond omnibus of 30 Days of Night is worse than the first one. Only really good story in this book is called 'Red Snow', author is Ben Templesmith (art + story). It's not the greatest horror comic tale you've ever read, but it's still pretty good. Part about Eben and Stella is probably the most pathetic mess from the whole book, but rest of the stories isn't much better. If you own first omnibus, you enjoyed it much and want to have both released omni's in your library, go and buy it. If not or you are in doubt, leave it, there are many better comics around.Artwork is not what I like ifThis is a great omnibus. Steve Niles continues his masterwork with Eben and Stella, a nightmare journey through L.A. Also included are a rather tragic tale by Niles, Dead Billy Dead, and the WONDERFUL Juarez by Matt Fraction and the ridiculously talented Ben Templesmith, featuring some truly demented killers and an even crazier investigator, Lex Nova (who needs some kind of follow up!). Both were previously published in Bloodsucker Tales. Mr. Templesmith writes and illustrates the chilling Red Snow, pitting Nazis against the undead in WWII Russia. Mr. Niles is joined by the legendary Bill Sienkiewicz for Beyond Barrow, a truly horrific story exploring the past of the troubled town. You wanna know more? Buy the book. All in all a very satisfying journey in a compact form. I love IDW for putting these omnibuses out! So convenient.I don't even know how this guy gets work in comics!!!He was complaining last year about not getting work from DC or Marvel.

That at least beats re-downloading the entire game every time.I bought this for my son�s Nintendo switch. Plug and play set up honestly. This is a great buy especially for the amount of gigs. Compared to an SD card with Nintendo�s artwork on it, the cost gives you the most bang for your buck. No one will be looking at the SD card anyway since you install it and never see it again.... but the shark is pretty sweet!! Will buy again in the future.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Kills bacteria and prevents algae. Protected against sunlight to last longer. For pools up to 5, 000 gallons. Prevents unsightly pool algae. *NOTE: Packaging may vary*I didn't buy a dispenser. I have an inflatable pool. I used a water bottle with holes punched in. The tablets dissolve just as well, it's free and it floats.I bought these tablets for the Kabooms in our three toilets. They are a good choice to replace the expensive Kaboom tablets that Kaboom offers. I use two tablets at a time that last three to four weeks. The most important thing is that they work, and it helps to keep the toilets clean.We are using this in the inflatable family pool. One a week in a small floater and the water has remained clear. Combined with a cover and small leaf remover - Saves the need to empty and waste 200 gallons each time the kids want to play in the pool.These are perfect for my 10 foot intex pool. Keeps it clean and the chlorine at a perfect level. Just keep 3 in the float and your setI'm using this in a homemade floater in my 10' by 6' inflatable backyard pool. It keeps the water clear and fresh, And mosquitos do not lay in the pool. I drilled small holes all around a plastic container with a tight fitting lid, and keep 1 tablet in there. When the kids at playing, i set it aside because they won't leave it alone. Almost no odor--if you put your face right to the water, you can just barely smell chlorine. Great for keeping the refills on the pool down to about once a week.Pro's:","Pro's:

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.We ordered our gazebo because our deck gets so much direct sun that we couldn�t enjoy our new deck on summer. We did an extensive research not just on Amazon but also in other online stores as well as Costco etc. during our research we found some super expensive and some much cheaper. The cheaper ones, it was clear why they were so cheap. The very expensive ones, not all were that good but most of them I can say were super over priced and many of them were extremely heavy. Not suitable to put on a deck. That�s a big mistake many people do. My husband is a contractor and have seen horrible things happening to decks with super heavy gazebos.Anyway, we decided to get this one and we are so happy we did it! It�s very sturdy! Ps: don�t forget to attach it to the deck as you suppose to do it. Between my husband and two of his guys they put it up I would say in 3 hours (more or less). The panels on top filter UVA rays which is great specially with all the sun we get. The nets are a nice thing once mosquitoes start coming. You close them, you still breath the fresh air and see everything going on around you without the annoying bugs. If you want privacy or if it rains, just close the curtains and everything inside will be protected from the rain. We don�t get a single drop of water inside no matter how bad the rain is.We have had a few bad storms with very strong winds here in GA this year (2022) and we missed a few curtain hangers and zipper sliders. I contacted the company to see what could they do� people, their customer service is beyond exceptional!!! They mailed the parts to me in no time. Followed up to make sure I got them and made sure I didn�t need anything else! All of this at no cost to me. Things can happen with any product of any kind, but it�s how the vendor reacts what really says everything about the company that you made the purchase from. We love our gazebo and we have enjoy it every season of the year. And no, I wasn�t paid or rewarded in any manner to write this review. They are just amazing people to deal with!!!As I sit here having my coffee under our new gazebo, I'm wondering why, oh why must spring be so windy & cold. I closed the curtains on three sides--hmmm. That's a bit better. I thought it would be rather gloomy in here with the curtains shut, but the top allows in plenty of well filtered light. No complaints of roof panels rattling in this wind except one did with a really big gust. You really have to follow directions and put them in correctly.My daughter put this together by herself. Of course, she had lame help from various kids and me. It took all day but that's really because she doesn't want to work with someone else. All the parts were there and were well marked.About the wind. We will have to buy weights and either sew or glue them to the bottom of the curtains to keep them from blowing so much.We will decorate it and anchor it to the deck, then I'll post a picture. This is really a lovely gazebo. If you're looking for a mid-priced hard top, drive this one to your deck. I recommend it.Oct. 27, 2021. We have used it for the whole summer season. Several thunder storms, that we rode out in this gazebo with the curtains zipped shut. Pretty cozy, even with some wind.The hurricane wasn't so cozy. We opened the curtains and moved everything out to protect from wind and rain. Same for the last wind storm with 60 mph gusts. Not a rattle or shake. Put together properly, this is a very sturdy kit.Feb. 17, 2022 update.About snow. I read that it couldn't take more than two or three inches of light, fluffy snow. Just at the moment, it has about six inchesThis product arrived on time. It was easier to assemble than other similar products as my guy had said it would take 2 days for 2 guys to assemble but they did it in 1 day.Looks beautiful and enhances my outdoor living area. We are enjoying our outdoor time more than ever.Some things to note :There are gaps on under the net and of course on the center top of pergola thru which mosquitos might get in even if you have the net open. But it does give a nice cozy feeling though with the net openThis product arrived in multiple boxes about 4-5 which is not mentioned in the product description. Would be nice to have that info to ensure you got all the piecesQuality materials. No damage. every part fit. instructions were a bit vague in spots that needed better picture of the orientation of the parts.I liked the fact that all the bolts had nuts that were welded in the right places, so bolts were easier to install. I liked that all parts were clearly alpha labeled.It did take about 5 hours with 2 persons to assemble...I do not like the fact that the bolts were Allen heads, with a small allen wrench.a drill bit should be supplied. Better would be star-head or phillips head screws.Allen wrenches are a stupid invention, designed to scrape knuckles and frustrate users.Well, if you expected a nice sturdy gazebo for $1500 look elsewhere (Costco, wayfair) this gazebo is 160 lbs weighs half of what other gazebos in that price category should weight. The seller is a disaster to work with! The description had 300+ lbs but what I received is 160 lbs and seller is either offering $15 or I need to pay for shipping back and will get 20% restocking fee. Stay away!Pro's:","Pro's:

Furniture and weights NOT INCLUDED. Search B08V94TZ7H for furniture.I love this gazebo. I wanted to get a jump start for the nice spring and summer weather and purchased this in February. It is sturdy and dry. I have already began to enjoy sitting, dining and relaxing under it, even during the colder days. Two people were able to assemble it and directions were fine. It held up well during our windy days in March. Customer service is also excellent. A few parts arrived damaged (perhaps by FedEx during shipping). The company sent me replacement parts immediately and I had them within a few days. I was amazed by their quick response and they were in constant contact with me. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase.Very nice 12x16 gazebo. Myself and my 12 year old son put it together. Product is great. Shipping by FedEx is horrible. They never update there shipping info. I received 4 packages out of 5. The 5th showed 4 days later even though it was at fedex with the rest.We love our 12x20 gazebo! To be fair, it is difficult to make sense of the instructions, but once you get that figured out it is well worth the hassle. Make sure to have at least 3 people to help you assemble. The gazebo is sturdy and good quality and we will be securing it down to the cement with some anchors just in case. We enjoy the option of the curtains for privacy. The size and space is also a plus. We have our hot tub and some furniture under and they fit just fine. The three loops under the roof are convenient for hanging lights and or fans. If you�re unsure about getting this gazebo, think no more. It is very nice! So glad we purchased this specific one.Edit: I wanted to update my review after getting some rain and snow. The gazebo stood up to both just fine. It is weatherproof and we have not noticed any drips or water leaks under the roof. Extremely happy with the purchase. Would definitely recommend.Very pleased with my purchase of the Purple leaf gazebo. From the start I was contacted by customer service with a message letting me know the 5 tracking numbers for FedEx that was shipping my gazebo. I was impressed the aluminum construction was so light it could be shipped FedEx. It arrived and the quality of construction was very good and solid for being light weight it is very strong and sturdy. The canvas curtains are very thick and heavy, i assume they will stand up to the harsh Arizona sun. The instructions were easy to follow, they were almost all pictures, few words and good labels on every panel and part and screw. My wife and I assembled it over 3 evenings, probably 8 hours total. The company checked in with me to make sure everything arrived, answered any questions I had, I was confident if there were an issue they would address it immediately.Great lookingTook a while to put togetherComes with extra screws and parts which is a great ideaShipping was fast and each piece was wrapped in a foam wrappingHave only two complaints directions need to be better and more completeWish there was a cover on the bottom of the legs to cover mounting screwsAll in all a great productPro's:","Pro's:

Text: Comes with regular glass and a saw tooth hanger for wall mounting. Made of MDF - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it. For other colors and non-standard sizes in this frame style search '2WOM76808-973-4x4'. Please note: actual color and wood grain may vary depending on the cut of wood and wood color. With its intricate beading and roped edged border this frame is a timeless classic that will highlight family moments wedding Photography and Contemporary Artwork in a fresh and tasteful mannerThis is a piece of junk. It says it comes with plexi glass. Plexi glass comes in various widths. Perhaps I was being overly optimistic but based on the price point and reviews my expectation is that it would be a thick piece of plastic resembling the thickness and hardness of the glass that comes on usual picture frames, or at least a thick enough piece of plastic to be easy to get it in and out of the frame to put my poster in and to give the piece a nice, smooth surface appearance. Boy was I wrong. The plexi glass is a thin sheet of flimsy, wobbly plastic with irregularities in it. Now that I have the piece together and hanging on my wall you can tell the plastic is bowing out and it isn't smooth and dust clings to it. The back is just a piece of regular packing cardboard and because the plastic is flimsy it doesn't securely sandwich the poster against the soft cardboard back, so there are little dips and wrinkles in the poster that are highly visible under the plastic. The frame itself is compressed paper with a faux wood finish on it that was already peeling off slightly in one corner when I received it. For not much more money I could have obtained a real wood frame with real glass from another company on Amazon.The original plan was to use this to house an irregularly shaped vintage map I had purchased at a market, and then to take it to a frame shop to have the framer cut a mat to fit the piece into the frame. The framing guy practically laughed at me when I brought this in. He said he couldn't do it because the quality of the frame was so poor and there was no way to affix paper or any kind of backing to the frame once it was finished. The mat would have cost $40, and he was willing to do a full professional frame job with a wooden frame and real glass and a mat for $120, so for only $40 more than the cost of this frame plus a mat. And I wasn't thrilled about leaving a civil war era map of Virginia with no protection other than flimsy plexi glass. So I paid the framer to do the whole job and figured I'd return this frame, but then finding a box to return it was a pain, so ultimately I went online and bought a poster that fits the frame and hung it in my office at work. It looks like crap.The packaging is marked Glass - there is no glass. This frame comes with plexiglass, which had scratches. The description says MDF, but also Wood. I took this to mean it was shaped MDF to resemble the grooms and texture of wood, like other frames I have that do this. It is not - it is MDF with a sticker wrapped around it printed with a wood pattern. It is a flat, very obviously cheap looking design. I had to request a return, which was approved, however I must pay the shipping. Based upon the size of the box, I am guessing the shipping will make the refund moot.There is nothing positive to say about this frame. You'd be better off saving your money and purchasing a poster frame for a fraction of the price.I've purchased this frame twice in the past couple of years and have been happy every time. The first purchase was for a very straightforward reason - I couldn't find a 12x24 frame anywhere locally. So I did a little research, found this frame on Amazon and (best of all!) the artwork fit perfectly! So when I needed another 12x24 frame... guess what came to mind? Another well built frame that perfectly complements my artwork. And best of all, despite being purchased over a year apart, the two frames looked perfect next to each other! Great quality and durable to boot... this frame is perfect for your artwork.I bought two 24x24 frames with custom mats to frame two 20x20 poster prints. Great quality for what you pay for (and remember what you paid. You aren�t buying expensive frames!) once framed, the wall art looks much more expensive and doesn�t look like basic posters. They are light so I imagine they will be easy to hang. Yes the hardware to hang the frames aren�t installed on the frame, but they are provided and aren�t hard to install. (It's not rocket science and won�t be my first time putting hardware on a frame.) they provide instructions to install the hardware. I will be opting out on the hardware provided and will purchase sawtooth hangers from Michael�s as I�ve found it�s easier to hang for me and level especially since I will be hanging them side to side (so happy not installed as it gave me the option to switch how to hang them up.) again so light due to the mdf frame so sawtooth hangers should work great, looks expensive for what paid for ( I paid less than $140 for both prints, frames and mats for 2� x 4� of art!) and can�t wait to hang them up!This came packaged with care. I didn�t have any frontal scratches and fit what I actually needed to frame. Easy to put together and hardware is included. I plan on rebuying another one for another painting and I can reuse the box it came in to send off. The way they have boxed the frame is perfect for gifting, IMO.Pro's:","Pro's:

Thank you!Very nice and strong!Love this hanging frame. Very easy to use and perfect for the print im using it on!Not worth the price. I recieved this with scratches some bubble and knicks.This product is made of wood that is not stained but painted which causes bubbles if not painted correctly. It is matte which makes it easy to get scratches. I think the scratches occured from sliding of the wood to get it lined up in order to plastic wrap it.It would be better if each piece was individually wrapped so no piece gets scrated when put together before it is sent out.This product has a strong hold and is able to hold my 20x30 photo print which is photo paper.I asked for a replacement hoping I do not get these issues. Also the $18 is pricey. I think this product should be worth $10-12 in the condition it is supposed to be recieved.* Got replacement and their were scratches.Pro's:","Pro's:

I would definitely buy this again.I don't usually write reviews but I was shocked enough by the quality of this frame to log in and write one. Wow! Amazing quality for $30! I was expecting something a bit more basic. This frame makes my poster look and feel like I had it professionally framed.

With everything you need included they are a pleasure to use and give the professional resultsI purchased the frame to display a puzzle given as a gift. The item arrived quickly and packaged securely. As a matter of fact, after the puzzle was framed, the packaging was reused to forward the gift safely halfway across the United States. The trip seems to attest to the fact that it is a sturdy product.The item itself is just amazing! I was impressed with how solid the poster frame felt when I removed the back to place the puzzle into it. I was concerned that the puzzle would shift during shipping to its destination, and I if I am completely honest, it did shift slightly, but it was only noticed by the recipient when I inquired about it. I purchased the modest flat black color to match any decor, as the gift was for a military person expected to change living spaces frequently. A personal touch to decorating always adds warmth to a room, no matter where it is. The gift recipient was happy with the gift.Overall, I would highly recommend this frame for photos or other mediums such as the puzzle I used it for.Pro's:","Pro's:

High-strength C300 steel allows for a strong fast face engineered for explosive ball speeds, paired with Twist Face technology to overcome inherent golfer tendencies on miss-hits for straighter shots.. Thru-Slot Speed Pocket. Thru-Slot Speed Pocket provides increased face flexibility, preservation of ball speed and distance, especially on low face strikes.. Draw-Bias Design. A strategically placed heel weight promotes draw-bias, while player-friendly lofts encourage an easy launch.The twist face helps minimize your hook/slice, I think that's the biggest gain in going with this club. The shaft stiffness is light, 45S, so it doesn't require a lot of torque to crack this thing down the fairway. I love hitting my 3W on the course again.Very disappointed the club didn�t come with a head-cover� 300 usd and no head-cover ? Is this club even legit ?I�m really happy with this new fairway wood. It gives me more control and helps to correct any mis hits. Love the weight I feel through the swing�.

DISPLAY WITH CONFIDENCE: Complete frame with UV Resistant Acrylic Front, Acid Free Foam Board Backing, and Hardware.. ? WALL HANGERS INCLUDED: Frame can be displayed vertically or horizontally. PROUDLY MANUFACTURED IN THE USASturdyI measured the panoramic puzzle once complete and it was exactly this size, maybe even a tad larger. So we ordered this frame hoping we can make it work. The box was delivered a little damaged but the packaging inside secured the frame so it was untouched. It's Plexiglas, which i love over actual glass for puzzles just for ease of use. The Plexiglas was sealed with vinyl that you had to peel. The puzzle fit exactly into the frame with the slightest bunching, but that was fixed using the foam core backing the frame came with. Also comes with hanging hardware that will have to be installed.I don't like writing reviews, but I dislike having to repackage and return-ship items that should not have left the shop even more. The frame itself was satisfactory, and the item was packaged well.But, the quality control on the acrylic was dismal. The acrylic was cut too small for the frame. It falls out the front of the frame. Also the acrylic, although covered in protective film, was scratched in several places.My picture is 26X26 yet this frame came a little smaller. My picture didn't fully fit in frame. Plus, I had to screw in the picture bracket to hang the picture. It would of been nice to have the bracket already added to the frame. I also didn't like the cheap white cardboard on the back of the frame. I expected better quality and won't recommend this company if you are looking for a quality frame.The frame in the pictures has beveling. The frame I received is thin and flat and much cheaper looking. What I received is completely different from what I ordered. Very disappointing. Too late to return as it was needed for a gift.Editing after framing (wrote the above after pulling it out of the box): frame is VERY flimsy. The plexiglass, picture, and backing were properly placed and when picking up the frame you have to be careful as the sides do not hold tight and the picture pops out. Also scratches very easily, and simply framing it on a clean dining room table left scratch marks on the front of the frame. Highly disappointed. This frame should not cost any more than $40. Had I known this is what I�d receive I wouldn�t have ordered it. Not worth $100. Cheap looking. Light and flimsy. Not the product pictured.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Ready to paint, acid free acrylic titanium primed. Ultrasmooth polyflax/ cotton canvas. Primed in usa. Stretcher strips: 11/16-inch by 1-9/16-inch. Suitable for oil or acrylic paintI bought my mom a canvas print last fall. I had no idea that it didn�t come stretched on a frame. I know nothing about canvas paintings but I tried to learn how to use stretcher bars without success. Finally I gave up and decided to find a blank canvas already stretched on a frame/stretcher bars so we didn�t have to mess with assembling anything. The size we needed seemed like it would have been standard (24x30) but after looking at multiple stores in person and online, I couldn�t find anything. It took me a long time of scrolling to even find this one by Fredrix. Today, my mom decided to stretch the canvas print on it. Instead of removing the blank canvas, she left it on and stretched the canvas print over the blank one. It turned out perfect. This blank canvas was the right size, and while the thickness was still somewhat thinner than we needed, it still turned out great and that�s without having to trim off any of the canvas print. Doing it this way is allowing the back of the print to be protected by the blank canvas. I�m sure this is not the traditional, or even recommended, way to use it but it worked for us. I will probably buy a couple of these for backups just in case it�s ever needed.I don�t know anything about painting on canvas so I can�t speak to that. I can only tell you that it�s basically the size we needed but couldn�t find elsewhere. The frame/stretcher bars seem stable and durable. It worked for the purpose we needed it for.smooth texture, great for portraits, fine detail or any other project that requires quality.Actually I didn't like the texture of the canvas or felt not so cotton natural And I regretted now having bought a more expensive better quality one.Ultra smooth.

Text: Made using the highest quality materials. Tested for durability. Designed to be safe and uniqueThis is my first review I have ever written. I bought a pair of 45 pound plates and I bought a pair of 35 pound plates. The 45 pound plates felt even and the 35 pound plates were not even. I worked out with them at least three times and I knew something was wrong when my form was off. I tried another pair of 35 pound plates and they did not feel like these 35 pound plates. The weight did not match one another. They were uneven. I believe this is why it is so cheap because some of the plates do not match with each other and they are not equal to one another. Also my plates had holes in them like It was cheaply molded together.I will not buy plates from this brand againI got 2 of these one plate is 38.9 pounds the other is 33.5 save your money. Not good.These are Old School Iron Weight Plates that gets the job done....Careful if buying these to try and match up to the standard height of a 45-lb plate. These are about 3/4"" to 1"" shorter than a standard plate. I like the wide-flange on these plates, but had to return due to the height. This height difference made a big difference when using for ground based lifts like deadlifting.I�ve dropped them a few times no cracks or chips so farPro's:","Pro's:

Just lay it down and open the frame edges (swing open like on hinges), lay in poster and shut edges back! Came with extra clear covering as well and screws to hang are through the open hinged frame area so they are not seen and the frame is firmly on wall, which is great because it was going in a nursery at ""kid level"". You can also hang with normal nail, screw on the outside of back frame too. LOVE IT!I needed this because I received a foreign movie release poster from japan. My living room is awesome.

I like these because the light is 360 degrees meaning it is even all the way around.Again, these are EXTREMELY BRIGHT so exercise caution when determining where to use them.

I purchased these to use in my John Deere riding Mower to replace the factory headlight which are the standard bulb type.Boy after the install it�s like night and day the difference and much better operating at night or in low light is now.I used these to replace the headlights in my lawnmower, a 30 year old Deere. The old lights were yellow and dim, partially due to the old plastic lense. These new led bulbs are bright enough to overcome the old hazy lense and bright white. Truthfully they are almost too much but I'll probably be buying another set for my other lawn tractor, who cares if the lawnmower headlights are always on ""high beam"".These seem to be quality bulbs. I got them because of their small size, but unfortunately they were still a little to big to fit the vintage license plate light fixture on my 1960 Ford f100 pickup bed trailer. I did test them, and they're very bright, so I'll keep them a different vehicle.Plug and play. Much brighter than stock incandescent bulbs.

Text: Kills bacteria. Kills and prevents all types of pool algae. Prevents corrosion, scale and stains. Long-lasting sunlight protection. NOTE: #Packaging may vary*Ordered the ""small"" bucket of this to try out the Clorox pool line. The 5lb bucket received was already open (the security band was not there) and it had more tablets in the bucket then it should have (13). I can only assume someone is refilling 5lb Clorox buckets with a cheaper plain chlorine tab. But who knows what is in it. And that's a safety problem. I have been the victim of altered pool products twice now and feel it is becoming a serious issue. For example, on another occasion I received a product that had the seal missing and was diluted with, hopefully, water. But without a lab to test it, who knows. That is the key problem, IF you get a mislabeled/counterfeit chemical product you could unwittingly cause a deadly chemical reaction with what is already in the pool. Saving money is not worth even the smallest risk.From now on I will be ordering only from pool suppliers instead of risking Amazon 3rd party garbage. The price of this bucket was on par with standard retailer prices so I wasn't saving anything but time getting this off Amazon anyway.Also, since I am unsure if I really received the CLOROX product I wanted to try, I will have to find another supplier to see if this line works for me on algae control. Ugh.Did not like receiving a product that was completely destroyed. These tablets were so busted that it was a bucket full of chlorine dust. There was only 5 tablets that were partially whole. I paid almost 100.00 for this since I am unable to find them at my local stores. I can understand if some broke in half during shipping because I could still use them but this is completely unacceptable and almost all unusable. Requested a return but was denied because it�s considered a flammable gas. Working on getting a refund and I will not quit until they make this right.I really needed these for my pool so my grandchildren can enjoy playing in the pool. I am so disappointed in the seller denying a return.They shipped a mostly empty bucket with about 2 inches of chlorine dust in the bottom and 5 partially broken tablets so why can�t I return there defective product.Best Pool Chemical line, I have found so far. Leaves our pool crystal clear. Never cloudy or dull water. Never have any algae. I have recommended it to all of my friends & neighbors when they ask me how I keep my pool water so clean & clear. Definitely a keeper. I know, I have had pools for almost 40 yrs.This is the first summer that we didn�t have any algae issues, & we know it�s because of this product. Our pool is 100% in the sun, & we always have issues with algae blooms. We�ve spent a fortune in the past trying to keep up with the algae. We even discussed getting rid of our pool because it was just too expensive, but after using this, we don�t have the issues anymore! We actually have slacked tremendously this year on pool care, & we�ve gotten a lot of rain (which usually wreaks havoc on the pool), but somehow our pool is still crystal clear.I cannot stress enough how happy we are with these tablets!This is great stuff. All the other reviews are NOT lying, these tablets last a very LONG time!!!!I put 3 in my floater for a 20x40ft pool and they lasted almost 2 weeks!!! Just make sure your water(PH, Acidity, Chlorine) is properly balance BEFORE using the tablets so you get the best performance outta them. If you need to raise you chlorine quickly, shock your pool then use them.Pro's:","Pro's:

If it comes to you and it's been damaged in shipping - IT IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE PRODUCT inside the box. You don't downgrade a product if the box is damaged. Sure it's too bad your product got damaged but that's on the shipping company. So my new Air Conditioner came well packaged and undamaged. It works perfectly. I smashed the box up after I took the AC out of it and guess what?! The AC still worked perfectly! This is a well made piece of equipment. Nothing fancy but you won't find a better price for this size window AC with an efficiency rating of 12 and Energy Star certified. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it or buy another. Stay cool my friends.This would be five stars but as others have posted the stupid lazy delivery drivers just refuse to treat them right. My wife was home and heard the delivery driver drop the package on our concrete porch on its side. The driver even took a picture of the unit on its side. The box was damaged but thankfully the unit was not damaged by this mishandling. Yes they're heavy. No there are no built in handles on the box. So what? The unit is quiet and works very well.Wow! this Window-Mounted Air Conditioner with Remote works great, low noise level and A/C cools my living room fast. Best 10000 BTU A/C I have ever purchase.Shipping: arrived fast, 1 day early, but the rear radiator fins were dented in 2 places. I had to use a knife to straighten them back out as best as i could. For something that cost $300, i was tempted to send it back, but straightening them out is a sacrifice i was willing to make rather than wait more days in the heat.Product:I'm temporarily staying in a 650 square foot space with only one HVAC vent. The room gets hot, so i needed a little extra cooling added. This unit does the trick perfectly. It's rated at 450sq feet, but doesnt have any problem keeping the 650sq ft room at cooler temps. The single AC vent had trouble keeping the space below 76 degrees. With this unit set at 69, it only has to run periodically and has brought the room down around 71.Well, found out how good customer service is. The answer is really spectacular. Made my day better, even with an issue with the unit, which came a little... Beat up? A couple spots on the side don't look brand new, and there were bad, annoying noises. I think a fluke. The unit is otherwise great. Amazon has good build quality otherwise, and you can't beat the customer service. So, I would say, try this before anyone elses brand. Even though mine had an issue.Pro's:","Pro's:

We do not use the remote nor do we have adequate internet to use the wifi so I cannot speak to those aspects.The one thing I want to share is UPS delivered it on it's side. Anything with refrigerant, an air conditioner or a refrigerator has to sit upright for several hours before it is plugged in because the refrigerant has to settle in the right place. My husband was out of town so I was able to have it sitting upright on the porch for 24 hours before it was installed and it works fantastic.It's easy to install and cools down the entire bedroom or living room very quickly! GE has very good quality products and this is no different. It also allows you to sign into an app which enables you to control the unit from your cell phone. It's also quite quiet. I have bought two - a 5000btu and an 8000btu unit. I've never been happier or cooler! I definitely recommend this brand and style of AC unit for your home.I thought it was going to be under powered for the space I needed it for. The next size up had a two week delivery estimate so I went with the 10k brush instead of the 12k. It's not under powered at all and can maintain cooler Temps on the economy mode very easily.About a week after installing this unit our upstairs air-conditioner went completely out. We were so glad we had this unit installed in our bedroom! The repair tech couldn't come out for almost a week, but we were able to stay igloo cool in our room thanks to this mighty might of an air-conditioner!We purchased this unit because our central air could not quite cool down our bedroom during the summer months, and it has proven to be a wise decision. It literally freezes us out sometimes, and we have to adjust the temperature so it isn't so cold! A nice problem to have!Awesome smart AC. Super cold, doesn't crap out after running for a few hours.

The acrylic insert has a protective peel-off cover on both sides. I will purchase these frames again for other projects!I am extremely happy with this frame! My sister just returned from Europe and much to my joy, gifted me a Van Gogh print from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, and while I didn't want to break the bank, I wanted a clean, classy looking frame that would hopefully last several years and look nice on my wall. This frame only cost me about $11.00, and it was a great purchase! The plastic, black frame is clean, shiny and smooth, and the clear plastic front is clean, perfectly clear, and you honestly cannot tell it is not glass unless you touch it yourself. I laughed aloud upon receipt of my frame, as at first, I noticed the ""dull,"" ""foggy,"" and ""streaked"" plastic so many other reviewers warned of, and I immediately remembered that on the item photos listed by the seller, it plainly shows that the plastic has two protective sheets around it which you need to peel off. I did so, and was pleased to discover the perfectly clean, clear plastic sheet I was hoping for underneath. The backing is sturdy and has decently strong metal clips holding it in place (they swivel side to side when you wish to take your print out), and two metal brackets, one horizontal the other for vertical hanging. Maybe my experience is unique, I don't know, but I would say to go ahead and buy this great, durable frame! Just be sure to peel off the two protective plastic sheets surrounding the actual plastic that will be placed over your image, and you're good to go!I had a diamond painting measuring 11.5 x 14.5 inches that I needed to frame. I ordered the 12x16 frame because it should have had a little extra room around the edges. It did not. It literally just fit in it. I�m not sure if it�s truly a full 12x16 because of this but thankfully the whole picture shows and the thickness of the diamond painting fits in it well.Great frames for the price. Uses spring clips on the back to hold the backing in which is sooo much easier then the bendable tabs most use.This will NOT fit your 12x16 prints. If you don't own a 11.81 x 15.75 inch picture it won't fit in this frame. Maybe then the frame itself is 12x16? nope - larger than those dimensions. I don't actually know what about this product is 12x16 inches. Would need to cut your print to fit this $13 frame.Maybe I could overlook the cheap-ish acrylic and dust prone plastic at this price point - but nothing fits.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Electronic controls with full function remote control. Digital time/temperature display and control with 24 hour on/off timer. 3 cooling and fan speeds. Dehumidify mode. Cools/heats rooms 350-450 square feetI bought this just before the last humid heat wave of the summer, and have continued to use it through the first truly chilly parts of fall. I have to say, despite everything I had heard about portable air conditioners, I actually really like this thing.I went with this over a normal air conditioner because I wanted to not have to worry about bugs (I can leave the window screen up) or cleaning up the unit after being outside. It's actually a nice-looking appliance, and certainly less of an eye-sore than a box hanging outside the window.A couple things I want to note about my time with this:1) The unit can be a little loud, but it's not that bad compared to other air conditioners, and it's pretty quiet with just the fan on. It will turn the compressor on and off to regulate temperature and manage its water level, so if large changes in volume bother you, I might look elsewhere.2) I personally never had to empty the water out of the unit when using the Cool, Dehumidify, or Fan modes, even in 90% humidity weather (something I had been warned about before purchasing portable air conditioners like these). It sucks water out of the air very well, and the auto-evaporative system seems to do its job. It's like having a dehumidifier you don't have to empty.3) When using the Heat option, you will likely have to empty the unit after extended periods (a few hours) of use. I've gotten into the habit of switching between Heat and Dehumidify right up until it gets to temperature, then I just leave it on Heat - it's usually fine from there. I'm also considering using the external hose hookup to drain water into a larger pan or bucket since that will be easier than lifting the unit to get to the bottom plug (which can be annoying).4) The more humid it is, the less effective it will be. That being said, I've been very happy with its ability to get down to 72 (my default target temp) even with the weather outside being 85 F or more. I'm using this to cool/heat a 350 sq.ft. room.5) Spend some time playing around with the temperatures you like for the Cool and Heat modes. They seem to take readings from different parts of the machine, so 72 on Cool mode may feel different from 72 on Heat mode. Also, it's very localized, so may take a bit for the temperature difference to reach all areas of the room.6) Don't forget to insulate well! I was happy with it before I took insulation seriously, but it works much better now that I paid attention to closing the gaps around the window adapter. I'm also considering insulating the hose, since that seems to radiate a bit of heat and is likely a source of inefficiency.If you're considering purchasing this, I would highly recommend you read over as much as you can about the pros and cons of portable vs. traditional air conditioners. For me though: I'm very happy with my decision to go with this unit.UPDATE 2 years later and it still runs but does almost nothing to remove humidity and it consumes way too much power for off-grid application. Switching to a separate dehumidifier and small window unit. UPDATE 06/22/2017: After using this in hot and humid weather for a few weeks I can say the efficiency is not that great. I have noticed in 85F+ degree weather the temperature on max cooling is only about 10F degrees cooler than outside. Humidity on cooling mode is only 10% lower as well above 50% relative humidity. In dehumidifier mode I have been experiencing an issue with the lower reservoir filling up even though I have a 1/4"" hose installed and run through the floor. After about 30 minutes in 80%+ humidity the whole unit will shut off with the ""bucket full"" indicator light lit. To remedy this I have applied suction to the end of the 1/4"" hose installed in the lower drain or removed the hose completely. The unit is rather loud when run in cooling mode for a long time. By loud I mean there are very abrupt noises like someone slamming a car door when the compressor cycles on and off. I also added insulation to the exhaust hose by wrapping in reflectix, this reduced the heat generated by the exhaust pipe. For reference on max cooling I used an inductive ammeter on the battery to LF AIM 2000watt inverter and read 200amps being consumed by only running the air conditioner in max cooling mode. It is less than that for dehumidifier mode only. I have also tested heating mode and it works but takes between 30~60 minutes to generate decent heat. Overall this heat pump does work, just not as well as in higher temperature and humidity environments.This does exactly what I need for my 150 sq ft space (insulated shed). I bought this based on using Solar power and a large 2K watt LF inverter with a 500Kwh battery bank (4xT105RE batteries). The power consumption on the highest air conditioning (cool) setting will run for a little over 3 hours on my system. The system runs much longer on dehumidifier setting though it seems the fan speed becomes automatic in dehumd mode. I have not used heat setting yet but mainly I am using dehumidifier with a 1/4"" O.D. hose in the bottom drain. The top drain is not a 5/8"" O.D. hose, but I believe a regular garden hose may screw into the threaded fitting on the top drain. Both drains filled up in 80% humidity in the low 80s (F) after about 10 hours. I have found with a 1/4 O.D. hose screwed into the bottom drain and draining through the floor I don't have to drain the unit after several days of use. I am using a 6"" louvered dryer vent tube through the wall and the exhaust hose fits inside the 6"" tube with a little room which can be tightened with a 6"" hose clam or tie wrap. One reason I bought this besides the good price and Amazon prime option was having had a through the wall A/C unit that lasted 15 years and is still going. I am hoping I get 1/3 of that life out of this portable unit. So far I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to cool a small space.I bought this because my previous Haier AC unit lasted 5 years and did a great job of cooling my apartment. This unit did very little cooling to begin with and died after 5 weeks. Haier will not replace or repair under warranty.Just went thru a devastating hurricane and was able to borrow a Haier Cooling Portable Air Conditioner which I used for a 90 year old COPD patient. It worked beautifully. Based on its performance, I bought this as a backup if and when another hurricane comes my way. I live in Florida. I ran the portable air conditioner on a generator. It was very easy to install and the cooling was more than I expected. Would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from power outages.The noise level of the air conditioner is on the loud side even at low setting. Does not keep the room cool enough even at high setting.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Can be controlled with full function remote
-Digital display of time/temperature

Text: Small portable air conditioner: this rolling, self contained, compact, portable ac unit cools small network closets and back offices where other cooling solutions don�t fit; this room air conditioner can also be used as a personal air conditioner for residential applications. 12,000 btu of cooling power: this AC unit delivers 12,000 betas (3.5kW) of air conditioning capacity to protect vital equipment against overheating; this unit uses environmentally friendly R410a refrigerant to comply with worldwide standards. Self contained design with simple installation: this air conditioning unit has no plumbing or special circuits, and a built in evaporator means there is no need to empty water collection tanks; the unit also dehumidifies and filters the air, and 100 percent duty cycle keeps your environment constantly cool with no downtime. Optional remote management for monitoring & control: install the optional srcoolnet network module (sold separately) to this space cooler to monitor temperatures, receive alerts, review logs, and control settings from anywhere, anytime, via snmp, web browser, ssh or TelnetThe general consensus on this unit is that it doesn't last long. I would have to agree that they all seem to fail after about 14 months, just beyond the warranty.Because I have prior experience in the construction, and specifically the HVAC industry, I decided to take this unit apart and figure out what happened. Here's my experience and how we extended the life of this unit.After about 14 months of using the unit it started to freeze up. This happens, normally, because of dirty filters or because of low charge. Because we had this in a server room the clogged filter was not the issue. So we took the unit apart to find the issue. Once the housing was removed we made the following observations and changes.1 - The unit is a sealed unit. You would think that this would prevent leakage of r410a, however these units either come really low charged or they leak slightly. Because the unit was freezing-over we added about 4oz of charge to it (that's a lot considering it takes 18oz total) and the freezing issue was resolved. Unfortunately, there's no fill valve because it's a sealed system. We had to tap the low pressure side in order to add charge. Be sure to use bullet taps on the low pressure 3/8"" side only. If you tap the high pressure side (1/4"") line you'll have leaks because of pressure.2 - The unit has a float that triggers the evaporation system. Unfortunately, the tray that holds the water is in direct contact with the coils and causes rust and corrosion. If I purchase another one of these I will likely take it apart and seal the area along side of the tray to prevent the corrosion of the metal coil. If you can use the drain it would be much better.3 - Bonus tip, a unit is more likely to freeze over at low fan speeds. This is contrary to what most people would assume. Keep the fan on high.Bought it for tent living. Tests OK, removes about 1 gallon / hour of purified water from the air. Seems well built. Packed well in heavy box, but has coasters on the bottom and recessed handles on the unit make it easy to roll on a hard surface.My Jackery 1500 won't handle the compressor start (inductive current load) but a hefty RV battery + inverter should work -- that's on order. may add a ""soft starter"" common for RV AC enthusiasts.There is no annoying ""thump"" when the compressor kicks in so it may have ""instant start?""One tip: The exhaust outlet hose gets HOT so keep it as short as possible or you have a heater & AC running in the same space. Ill probably wrap it in a reflective space blanket type of insulation for final install.There are other 1/2 price competitor units available, but this is the first one I have tried.Fire season last summer (2020) was brutal. The sky turned orange. Our building doesn't have AC. Our old unit was a generic white blah machine from some home brand, and it wasn't keeping up. I've used Tripp Lite products at work for decades now, so figured what would be better than a unit that's designed to operate 24x7 and has real engineering behind it. Gen2 solved all the problems people mentioned from the original, and I couldn't be happier. I'm buying a second one for our new two bedroom place to prep for 2021 fire season right now. I also love that I can hook it up to my home network for SNMP monitoring and alerts.This was purchased to replace our old roof top HVAC for our office server room. We have been downsizing and putting a lot of our services in the cloud, and did not have a need for an expensive replacement $17k at least.Our server room is only 8x10 feet so a small 1 ton AC was fine. We were quoted $5k by an HVAC company to install this exact unit. So we purchased off Amazon ourselves and paid another HVAC install company less than $300 to install it properly. But I'm sure we could have done it our self. There is a great Youtube video by Tripp Lite on the installation of this exact unit. Best Feature is the built in dehumidifier, you don't need to pipe to a floor drain(we didn't have one) and you don't need to regularly empty a water collection tank.So even if we had to replace this little unit once a year, we could get 17 years of usage for less than the roof top HVAC units.Purchased my first unit January of '16. It lasted a little over two years running 24/7 in a server room. It stopped blowing cold. I figure I got my money's worth out of it.Bought another in April of '18. It's still running strong 24/7, keeping my machines and network cool @71 degrees. I could force it cooler, I'm sure, but there's no need in my environment.When this one fails, as it is sure to do, I will buy another one. In the end it's easier and less of a time sync than the proposed fixes when it stops blowing cold.VERY easy to set up. No condensation/water waste.Pro's:","Pro's:

It was a two man job but was assembled in less than 2 hours. Very sturdy and fits perfectly on our patio. Love the netting on all sides for easy access. It looks better than the pictures. Very happy so far with this purchaseI�m love with this gazebo, easy to ensamble, me and my husband did everything in two hours, excellent quality, everything was complete and fit perfect, my family loved to spend the afternoons sitting there with this warm weather in Florida, best purchase ever!!!I give ABC canopy five stars for both customer service and product quality. I had a mishap were accidentally ordered a different tent from Home Depot before ordering this tent on Amazon. When the tent from Home Depot arrived I thought it was this tent and complained to ABC canopy that they sent me the wrong product. After going back-and-forth many times, I finally realized the mistake that I had made. ABC�s customer service department was extremely professional and nice to me even when I was being impatient and rude. I apologized vehemently but still feel bad for the mishap. In terms of the tent, the quality could not be better. It is much higher quality than any other tents I�ve seen at the farmers market. The frame is very sturdy but also easy to set up and take down. The accessories are fantastic because they allow for lots of different weather conditions. The fabric is very high-quality and blocks the sun quite well. I am extremely happy with my purchase!After lots of research and reading of reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I live in Hawaii so it gets hot, rainy, windy�everything. I have a small 8x8 wooden patio and this gazebo is perfect for it. Assembly took maybe an hour with two people. It would probably be doable with one person but I wouldn�t recommend that. The individual welds in the pieces are very poorly done so be careful when putting it together so you don�t bend one of the pieces. Once put together it sort of stabilizes itself. So far it seems sturdy and looks very nice. I screwed it directly into my wooden deck. Overall, I am super happy with it. Delivery was very fast and I now get a lot more use out if my outdoor space??I was worried having seen and used many pop up canopies in the past. I read the reviews and thought, I�ll see. My wife needing a new one for a swap meet bought another brand and I bought this one. Hers has never made it up in the air without issue, save $20 and it will cost you, buy the real deal and don�t worry about being pinched, leaning, collapsing, junk. The ABC is awesome, bag is awesome, wheels on the bag.....awesome! Easy up with one but it�s easier with two, shade curtains, awesome, I couldn�t be happier with the purchase and when the time comes that I need another, I know what I am going to buy and it will say ABC on it! I use it at the house, at car shows, sporting events, parking lots, grass, asphalt, concrete. Don�t wait, don�t hesitate, make sure you have room to haul it, and then buy it and enjoy it worry free!Pro's:","Pro's:

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.We ordered our gazebo because our deck gets so much direct sun that we couldn�t enjoy our new deck on summer. We did an extensive research not just on Amazon but also in other online stores as well as Costco etc. during our research we found some super expensive and some much cheaper. The cheaper ones, it was clear why they were so cheap. The very expensive ones, not all were that good but most of them I can say were super over priced and many of them were extremely heavy. Not suitable to put on a deck. That�s a big mistake many people do. My husband is a contractor and have seen horrible things happening to decks with super heavy gazebos.Anyway, we decided to get this one and we are so happy we did it! It�s very sturdy! Ps: don�t forget to attach it to the deck as you suppose to do it. Between my husband and two of his guys they put it up I would say in 3 hours (more or less). The panels on top filter UVA rays which is great specially with all the sun we get. The nets are a nice thing once mosquitoes start coming. You close them, you still breath the fresh air and see everything going on around you without the annoying bugs. If you want privacy or if it rains, just close the curtains and everything inside will be protected from the rain. We don�t get a single drop of water inside no matter how bad the rain is.We have had a few bad storms with very strong winds here in GA this year (2022) and we missed a few curtain hangers and zipper sliders. I contacted the company to see what could they do� people, their customer service is beyond exceptional!!! They mailed the parts to me in no time. Followed up to make sure I got them and made sure I didn�t need anything else! All of this at no cost to me. Things can happen with any product of any kind, but it�s how the vendor reacts what really says everything about the company that you made the purchase from. We love our gazebo and we have enjoy it every season of the year. And no, I wasn�t paid or rewarded in any manner to write this review. They are just amazing people to deal with!!!As I sit here having my coffee under our new gazebo, I'm wondering why, oh why must spring be so windy & cold. I closed the curtains on three sides--hmmm. That's a bit better. I thought it would be rather gloomy in here with the curtains shut, but the top allows in plenty of well filtered light. No complaints of roof panels rattling in this wind except one did with a really big gust. You really have to follow directions and put them in correctly.My daughter put this together by herself. Of course, she had lame help from various kids and me. It took all day but that's really because she doesn't want to work with someone else. All the parts were there and were well marked.About the wind. We will have to buy weights and either sew or glue them to the bottom of the curtains to keep them from blowing so much.We will decorate it and anchor it to the deck, then I'll post a picture. This is really a lovely gazebo. If you're looking for a mid-priced hard top, drive this one to your deck. I recommend it.Oct. 27, 2021. We have used it for the whole summer season. Several thunder storms, that we rode out in this gazebo with the curtains zipped shut. Pretty cozy, even with some wind.The hurricane wasn't so cozy. We opened the curtains and moved everything out to protect from wind and rain. Same for the last wind storm with 60 mph gusts. Not a rattle or shake. Put together properly, this is a very sturdy kit.Feb. 17, 2022 update.About snow. I read that it couldn't take more than two or three inches of light, fluffy snow. Just at the moment, it has about six inchesThis product arrived on time. It was easier to assemble than other similar products as my guy had said it would take 2 days for 2 guys to assemble but they did it in 1 day.Looks beautiful and enhances my outdoor living area. We are enjoying our outdoor time more than ever.Some things to note :There are gaps on under the net and of course on the center top of pergola thru which mosquitos might get in even if you have the net open. But it does give a nice cozy feeling though with the net openThis product arrived in multiple boxes about 4-5 which is not mentioned in the product description. Would be nice to have that info to ensure you got all the piecesQuality materials. No damage. every part fit. instructions were a bit vague in spots that needed better picture of the orientation of the parts.I liked the fact that all the bolts had nuts that were welded in the right places, so bolts were easier to install. I liked that all parts were clearly alpha labeled.It did take about 5 hours with 2 persons to assemble...I do not like the fact that the bolts were Allen heads, with a small allen wrench.a drill bit should be supplied. Better would be star-head or phillips head screws.Allen wrenches are a stupid invention, designed to scrape knuckles and frustrate users.Well, if you expected a nice sturdy gazebo for $1500 look elsewhere (Costco, wayfair) this gazebo is 160 lbs weighs half of what other gazebos in that price category should weight. The seller is a disaster to work with! The description had 300+ lbs but what I received is 160 lbs and seller is either offering $15 or I need to pay for shipping back and will get 20% restocking fee. Stay away!Pro's:","Pro's:

I'm using the PS5 included hdmi cable and have tried a couple others as well. As far as I'm aware an HDMI to DP cable (not adapter) isn't really a thing so I can't try that. Not Viotek refund/good conscious credit eligible since purchased from another Amazon retailer when not being sold (at the time) on Viotek Amazon store. Smh...I've contacted Viotek support and spent about a week getting 0 answers. Being told to use a different cable. Being told there aren't any settings I can change on the monitor. Being told to check the PS5 settings. Then after not being given any answers told to ask Playstation. What info will they have on why your monitor won't switch to 120Hz when all of the system settings are ready to send 120Hz?If there's something I've missed, please someone let me know what I need to do and I can update this product review. Also told I can't get a refund due to not purchasing from Viotek themselves. Kinda makes sense but they didn't offer anything at all in lieu of this monitor not performing as listed. Only reason I spend the money with them.My monitor works just fine. If you�re on the fence about it and are looking for better than the baseline but not top of the line, I�d say go for it. I picked it because it was a good value for a curved monitor. Personally, I love it. I never thought I could afford a �fancy� monitor, though this was still a little out of my price range. I don�t use it for gaming, unfortunately, so can�t speak to that, but videos and documents look great on it. No missing pixels. HDMI cord (not included) had some problems staying connected - could be an issue with the monitor�s port but I�m not sure.The little tabs on the back plastic panel broke off when I was first putting it together, but that was my fault probably, and doesn�t really make a difference (just exposes the cords in the back a bit). Despite these concerns, I�m still quite happy with the purchase.Dude, these are amazin. BRIGHT, CLEAR and so many color adjustments you can fiddle with. The curved part took me a week or so getting used to but just like getting new glasses, your brain neuro-compensates and you're fine.Screen real estate is amazing. For the price, I grabbed TWO of these things and am loving it!!! the 1440 vertical on DisplayPort (not HDMI, that I hear is slightly less) is amazing for keeping a few windows open and pinned to the sides of each monitor. For me, VS Code, a browser, slack, etc. all fit nicely in there. A great entry into the curved monitor world! I can't emphasize enough how BRIGHT these things are. you can of course adjust down if you need to (I did once when I woke up in the middle of the night and didn't want to keep the wife up, the screen was so bright it was like a lamp on in the room!)Lots of flexibility on the settings. The OSD navigation is not any more or less complex than any other monitor. Slightly easier than my Sceptres. VESA mount too, I threw them both on to the waiting arms and they are a joy to fiddle with and adjust height on. Although the stands that came standard are nice and sleek looking, they were a little too low for my tastes, so I used my monitor arms.No dead pixels, and their zero dead pixel policy really set my mind at ease. I feel like I'm finally into the future with these things instead of acting like some hillbilly banging two rocks together with my old flatscreens.nanPro's:","Pro's:

Text: OUTPERFORMS FIBERGLASS, WASHABLE AND NON-ELECTROSTATIC 3-month pleated 1 in. home air filters for your furnace, air conditioner or HVAC system. DESIGNED WITH EXCLUSIVE Filtrete Brand 3-in-1 technology from 3M to trap unwanted air particles while letting cleaner air flow through. ATTRACTS AND CAPTURES microscopic particles such as smoke, cough and sneeze debris, bacteria and viruses--and large particles, including lint, household dust and pollen. 1500 MPR has a rating of MERV 12. The higher the MPR, the more microparticles--such as pollen, pet dander, smoke, bacteria and viruses--your filter will capture from the air passing through it. 54% SMALL PARTICLE CAPTURE, like bacteria and particles that carry viruses ( % captured is based on ASHRAE 52.2 testing for 0.3 to 1 micron particles from the air passing through the filter, which relates to HVAC industry standard efficiency testing). CERTIFIED as asthma & allergy friendly (As outlined in report ASCR: 1246-01)Origionally I bought these because i made a $50 bet with my husband that a quality air filter can help alleviate allergy symptoms in the home. He swore the only difference in air filters was the price. I don't know what I enjoyed more, the $50 or the moment I looked him dead in the eye & said those glorious words ""I told you so""Has made a positive difference, for everyone in our home. The other day, after our day was ending, we both had noticed how nice it was 2B able 2 enjoy our dinners w/o the sounds of runny noses, ??????being sucked up. Or ?? blown out in2 tissues, cloth napkins, or the closest piece of clothing that, that some1can find. In order 2 prevent them frm spraying a sneeze, all over the table, the foods & drinks or even the worst, others sitting next 2 the person doing the sneeze ??. Unfortunately, I 4got 2 take a B4 & after photos ?? of the filter. However, I believe that it is extremely important 2 do so. It will B very helpful 4U 2 see ?? how much of the stuff that is in the air, is actually filtered out. The reason I feel like this is important, is bcuz I have yet 2B able 2 leave the filter in 4 the recommended efficiency time. The filter is so effective the efficiency of the filter. Although, the recommended length of change every 3 months. After about 5 - 7 weeks, I have had 2 replace the filter in order 2 maintain the efficiency in cleaning the air. We live in a very clean area, that has well maintained grounds w/ groomed hedges trimmed trees & no non maintained areas around us. A clean neighborhoodThese filters are great, and exactly what I wanted. One HUGE NOTE OF CAUTION is how and when you place your order. I recommend that you purchase them by themselves and not even within days of when you place any separate orders containing anything remotely heavy or sharp. Amazon will ship these combined with anything without regard for how fragile they are, and they'll come crushed or torn if you're not careful. I've had to return them which was a giant PITA because my nearest UPS store is 45 minutes away. Other than that, they've always been what I ordered, without any fakes.I've been buying the Filtrete MPR 1500 Ultra Allergen filters for years. I will likely never go to another type of Filtrete, not to mention a different brand. If anything, I may go up a level or two if I ever anticipate lengthy construction projects in my home. However, I can say without a doubt that I feel my 3200 sq ft home has noticeably cleaner air. I've even had a slip of the mind and didn't change the filters for over four months before. Keep in mind, that's NOT a good idea.Nonetheless, the filters kept working fine and I noticed no degradation to my HVAC and during regular maintenance, there were no issues in my home system. Again, I strongly advise replacing them every three-ish months or less. I'd say that during normal operation, one should inspect the filters at least once a month.These filters are not restrictive whatsoever. I haven't noticed any issues in my heating and cooling for as long as I've used them--including when I accidentally went over in their lifespan.I'll keep buying these for as long as they make them and quality is maintained! Unlike some other reviewers, I have never had an issue with quality. I'd also like to point out that I do not care if the cardboard around the filters has tiny imperfections. It's hidden and has never affected the air quality or function of my system whatsoever.Buy these! You won't regret it.I have tired many air filters over the years and have come across 2 problems. One, the filters that protect better, often restrict the air flow too much and have actually shut down my furnace. Two, the air filters that allow good air flow don't filter very well. This is the best air filter that I have found that will both filter well and also not restrict air flow. If you have any of the two issues I did, do not hesitate to give these a try.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Polyester,Polyurethane. 10' x 10' TEEPEE TENT � Guide Gear Teepee Tent for adults offers ease and convenience. An excellent 4-season tent for outdoor camping, hiking, backpacking, with all-around performance.. SLEEPS 2 PEOPLE � Offering plenty of room for the whole group, this camping tent sleeps 2-people, plus offers room for gear. Its sewn-in polyethylene floor provides a sturdy base and does not require a ground tarp.. ALL-WEATHER DESIGN � A heavy-duty 190-denier polyester shell with 1,000mm polyurethane coating makes this teepee tent waterproof. It has 3 weatherproofed windows and rain-protected ventilation at peak.. FAST AND EASY TO SET UP � A fast and easy setup makes this teepee tent instant to assemble. Just position the steel center pole, stake out the guy lines, and your basecamp is complete. 6'6"" center height. 3 Windows: 3 18""w. x 14""h.. CARRY CASE FOR EASY TRANSPORT � Packs up easily with a carrying case that makes it easier than ever to transport. Pack it up in the car, this portable outdoor tent is ready for your next adventure. Weighs 13.07 lbs.This is my day shelter when lake or truck camping. I waterproofed all seams before use. For three days it rained. There was some leakage. I reset some stakes on the second day and reduced leakage substantially. I think another coat or two will just about stop it. Fit and finish looked great. A few stray threads, clipped. Entry, easy enough, exit when everything is zipped is a bit tedious. You must be on hands and knees to reach zippers. It takes two hands to start unzipping. Velcro from outer door gets stuck to the netting. Be careful to store outer door. Easy in out if just outer door is velcro together. Ventilation adequate on a 70? sunny day. Room for my coleman cot, cooler and clothes. Use hook on center pole for a light hanger.Great tent. It functions just as great as it looks. We have fit a queen size mattress and a couples sleeping bag on one side and still had half of the tent to use. I�m 6 foot tall and can almost stand up straight in the center of the tent. Making getting dressed so much easier. Ventilation is superb and completely adjustable. Many people complained about leaking. I sealed it before I took it out and had zero issues with it in the rain.Junk. Didn't last through 1 summer. Dry rotted or something from being in the sun. Ripped very easy. Tossed it in the trash. Will never buy this brand again.It was easy to set up. Light enough but still pretty heavy, not for distance hiking. No tears or rips. Only complaint is, if you are in an area with any moisture in the ground or rain, the tent will literally flood with moisture overnight. Even ventilated, which you have to limit due to temperature. If I didn't have a 3 bag sleeping system with a waterproof shell, there would've been nowhere dry or warm to sleep. Not everyone can afford a $300 sleeping bag, nor should they have to. Also, that style sleeping bag is quite heavy and not for hiking in conjunction with a tent. Otherwise, it survived 42 days in a row. Oh, and if your looking for completely bug proof, there is an opening where 3 zippers meet making it impossible for it to be fully insect proof. Wasn't a bad accommodation for the price for a 42 day stay though.I had hoped the 10' teepee style would be large enough to accommodate my cot comfortably, but it just barely fits. There is no possible way that this tent could fit more than two adults. The pole in the middle of the interior is a little annoying to get used to, but having only one pole in general to deal with is amazing.Pro's:","Pro's:

I needed a backpack that worked as a lunchbox and a backpack so I could carry my food and drinks as well as my laptop, pens, meds, notepads, lady things, etc. to work without having to take a lunchbox, backpack, AND purse to work. I like that there�s a hidden pocket where the shoulder straps are so I can keep thinks like my AirPods and chargers semi-secure while my backpack is on or just sitting around (because that pocket is hard to notice).There�s also a nice place to hook your portable charger inside, and a netted pocket where it can stay safe, and a place for you to charge your phone outside the backpack.The backpack is very unisex. I plan to add a little glittery monogram to the outside to make it look girly for my tastes.I know many are worried about leaking between the lunchbox area and the laptop area, but it is virtually leakproof. The laptop has a designated sleeve that is made of a slick material and even has a Velcro latch to hold it in there. This sleeve is at the rear portion of the backpack. The lunchbox portion has the slick, leakproof insulation material that should keep all the liquids in. I�ve had things leak inside the lunchbox and they remained there and were easily cleaned. Also, the lunchbox portion has a pocket on the front where you can keep utensils or small snacks or whatever you�d like.nanThe lunch bag part gets cramped if you shove a lot of stuff in the regular bag like my mom does. But dang this thing holds up to three chromebooks and a bulky notebook along with a few folders of paper. My mom is a teacher and she puts her bags through hard work. Even overfilled this bag is preforming well.Amusingly even though the lunch box part gets cramped I can still fit a sandwich and ice pack in it as long I put a plate in to protect the sandwichI bought this hoping that it would be a great carry-on and work bag in one. It is. I fly back and forth a lot as a travel nurse. My small purse and stuff fits perfect inside of it, plus laptop and any other stuff that you want to fly with, then when you get to work it has that cooler thing in the front to stick some snacks and stuff in (not a huge cooler- maybe a sandwich and a soda and a few things, but I can't imagine that it would fit more than a few small tupperware). I use it on flight for my meds that need to stay cold, with a few small ice packs that can get thru TSA. Two places to stick your water bottle. Hidden compartment in back for your valuables. It's stylish, easy to pack and carry, and I cannot say a bad word about it!I got this backpack to reduce the amount of bags I carried to work and I'm very happy with it. It has plenty of space for my lunch, all the small things I would normally carry in my purse, my work folders and my large tablet. I also carry a medium sized (24 oz) water bottle on the side pocket. My large 40oz bottle doesn�t fit. I was most concern with the condensation of the lunchpail part leaking into the book part, but I have not had any issues with it so far. I don�t leave the lunch or the cold packs in it too long though cause as soon as I get to work I put them in the fridge so I can�t say for certain how good the insulation is.I�ve used it everyday for about two months now and no issues with the quality. It would have been nice if the front lunchpail zipper was double, but other than that I love it. The color is pretty neutral for guys or girls. The description is pretty true.Pro's:","Pro's:

I would definitely buy this again.I don't usually write reviews but I was shocked enough by the quality of this frame to log in and write one. Wow! Amazing quality for $30! I was expecting something a bit more basic. This frame makes my poster look and feel like I had it professionally framed. Excellent choice!My frame arrived in only two days after 5-7 days was predicted. It came priority and carefully packaged. The frame itself is just perfect and is a hard to find 9x9 size! It now holds my 3d diamond painting project. The clear front piece was covered on both sides with a blue protected film.

With everything you need included they are a pleasure to use and give the professional resultsI purchased the frame to display a puzzle given as a gift. The item arrived quickly and packaged securely. As a matter of fact, after the puzzle was framed, the packaging was reused to forward the gift safely halfway across the United States. The trip seems to attest to the fact that it is a sturdy product.The item itself is just amazing! I was impressed with how solid the poster frame felt when I removed the back to place the puzzle into it. I was concerned that the puzzle would shift during shipping to its destination, and I if I am completely honest, it did shift slightly, but it was only noticed by the recipient when I inquired about it. I purchased the modest flat black color to match any decor, as the gift was for a military person expected to change living spaces frequently. A personal touch to decorating always adds warmth to a room, no matter where it is. The gift recipient was happy with the gift.Overall, I would highly recommend this frame for photos or other mediums such as the puzzle I used it for.Pro's:","Pro's:

SIP ON COMPLETE PROTEINS: Quest Salted Caramel Protein Powder is made with complete, dairy-based proteins. FAST AND SLOW ABSORBING PROTEIN: Quest Salted Caramel Protein Powder is made with 60% fast absorbing Whey Protein Isolate and 40% slow absorbing Micellar Casein to provide you with the ideal balance for your workout. SWEET WITHOUT ALL THE SUGAR: Enjoy the creamy and rewarding taste of a salted caramel shake with 1g of sugar. Canister contains ~ 24 scoops of Quest Salted Caramel flavored protein powderI use this powder to make waffles.-1 scoop of powder-1 egg-1 TBS butter-a small amount of water to thin out the batter.This makes two waffles at 1 net carb each.The flavor is great and it feels like I'm having a cheat meal. I definitely recommend the Cinnamon Crunch flavor!I discovered Quest products a couple years ago during my Keto journey. I can honestly tell you that I�ve always been pleased with the quality. While everyone has there own favorites when it comes to taste. One thing you can be sure of is you�re receiving the best ingredients with whatever your choice. There are tons of recipes available online for different drinks and baking recipes.I�m addicted to the Caramel Protein powder and it�s been my go to for well over a year now. Generally I mix it in my morning smoothie using 8 ounces of a favorite almond/coconut milk a few ice cubes and it fuels my body, keeping me satisfied well into the afternoon. Another option I enjoy is replacing the milk with cold brewed coffee. Either way you�re in for a treat! A taste that easily compares to your favorite milkshake. The options are endless, whether to choose to drink or bake with it.For me personally I feel using a blender makes it extra tasty with a thick texture. Especially with about a cup or so of ice cubes. I�ve heard of others hand mixing it but I don�t know if I�d enjoy as much that way.So with that said, I highly recommend Quest Protein Shakes. I hope you�ve found my review helpful as I rely heavily on them and try to mention what�s important to me. If you�ve found my review helpful, please click below to let me know. Should you have any questions you can post them above in the designated area.Thank you for taking the time to read my review and Happy Shopping!Miss KellyAt my last physical, my doctor suggested that I consume more protein. However, I am a vegetarian (unless I see bacon, in which case all bets are off) and so getting sufficient protein without increasing calories to levels unacceptable to me has proven difficult. I vaccinate between angrily grumbling about know it all doctors and just giving up on eating more protein, or gaining weight trying to force my diet to provide complete proteins - lots of beans and rice and tofu and, come on, none of that stuff is edible unless it has lots of fat and a pretty fair amount of salt.I don�t know where the idea of protein powder entered my head because protein powders are not the sort of thing I had ever really been aware of, and if I had been aware of protein powders I would have wondered who the hell would use them. Like, why? Why eat powder, unless it�s the powder on a donut (did I mention I have a sweet tooth?). What a strange thing to do. But you know the internet, and how it takes you to places you never expected to go, whether you like it or not. One day I somehow ended up on a site comparing protein powders. I read, fascinated, and kind of grossed out about gritty smoothies and lumpy shakes. About faint whiffs of horrible smells and terrible tastes (no matter how much reviews try to make you believe something tastes acceptable, I can always detect a big hint of ambivalence, a sort of shirking of recognition of the truth - phrases like �you can barely taste it� and �it was almost like my regular coffee only with a different taste� or �I gulp it down like medicine and feel good about it� or �it�s barely gritty at all if you use a high speed blender� or my favorite, �the globules of undissolved powder are not too slimy and it pretty much does taste like chocolate� give the game away.After reading enough reviews of different powders to make my head spin, and finally even taking notes, I realized there was a pattern - one brand of protein powder was lauded for more than its protein and other things that I have not a clue about (MCTs?, BCAAs?). This one brand of protein powder was actually lauded for taste, no matter mostly people talked about the salted caramel flavor, the idea of which makes me want to barf, their rhapsodic descriptions of deliciousness and the overall apparent agreement that this powder had all the acronyms generally agreed to be necessary along with a gold standard amount of protein made me decide to order it. I just hoped salted caramel was not the only flavor.Not to keep you in suspense, because, here I am reviewing Quest Vanilla Milkshake Powder, the powder brand I decided to try was indeed, Quest. It arrived in a big ass tub and the instructions printed on the side talked about it�s scoop, which I though I had forgotten to buy - but no, it�s scoop does come with it, it was just hiding, lodged firmly down at the very bottom of the powder, goodly quantities of which were sadly lost In a powder cloud that arose during my excavations.When talking about protein powder, just about everyone said, don�t try this with just a spoon and a glass or you�ll be horribly sorry, so I had purchased a plastic cup with a sort of odd plastic weathervane attached to the bottom and surprisingly, a USB cord - It really IS the future when even your cup needs to be charged, though I�m surprised it didn�t come internet ready. Next iteration. Nearly everyone also said don�t try this with water - get some some milk, even nut milk If that�s all you can find, or coffee, or something else to disguise the powder in. But I decided to just jump in the deep end with this and so once my cup was charged and emitting an eerie green light, I added 8 ounces of water, pushed the button on the cup, which created a sort of negative tornado, and added a scoop of the powder, which got just consumed by the tornado, and let it twirl for 5 seconds as the cup had indicated. With trepidation I poured the resulting creamy, foamy looking mixture into a glass in which I had added several cubes of ice and took a sip. OMG, OMG, OMG! It was not just acceptable - it was downright delicious. Slightly creamy, softly vanilla-esque, with a gentle sweetness that was fabulous to the bottom of the glass. No grittiness, no powder in my mouth, and certainly no globules, slimy or otherwise marred the drink. I actually clobbered my nose with the ice cubes trying to suck out the last drops of its goodness. So no, it doesn�t need anything but water, and possibly a cup with a USB cable to be wonderful (don�t tell anyone, but I might even add a shot of rum and maybe a slice of pineapple once in a while because I think it might make a killer pina colada type deal.) I have no doubt that I will enjoy the tub of Quest to the last scoop and I think I will get on a delivery schedule for it. Just wait till my doctor finds out I actually listened to her.She said �Mommy, it tastes just like a milkshake!�My sweet girl is on a medication that unfortunately has loss of appetite for a side effect. Protein shakes help her get nutrients that she needs to grow. She has loved drinking protein shakes since she was 2. However, this is by far her favorite one!I have been spending a lot more time at home since the covid 19 quarantine... and drinking much more coffee. I was shocked when I realized each cup had about 120 calories (sweeting with honey and half & half). I decided to try a lower carb protein powder to replace BOTH and reduce calories/add protein.On to the powder. Honestly, to me, it tastes on it�s own almost exactly like every other protein powder I�ve tried (not many, maybe slightly better? Definitely tastes like protein powder though). My first experience putting into already brewed coffee left me with chunky, undrinkable coffee. But it can work. Read on.The secret to a palatable cup of protein coffee with this is... mixing the protein powder with luke warm water until dissolved in the bottom of your cup, then add coffee to the powder mixture. If you have a tiny whisk use it. **Do not add the powder to your brewed coffee.**I purchased this because of the flavor description and reviews mentioning coffee, yet no one explained how to make that work. Keep your spoon/tiny whisk handy, coffee will need additional stirs as you sip. However it is sweet enough to replace both my half & half and honey thus reducing calories and increasing my daily protein intake. Overall a success.Pro's:","Pro's:

Gauge: 22g(0.6mm);Inner diameter:5/16""(8mm). 4PCS Per Pack: one of silver,one of black,one of gold,one of rose gold.. Package include:4pcs nose hoop rings , come with one free gift velvet bag.I bought this specifically for the black hoop but it was a better deal to buy all four colors than to buy the black from a different vendor.Though I was worried that it might be hard to insert the hoop from INSIDE my nostril, it actually was really easy. I like this a lot better than captive bead or bendable hoops. Also, the black hoop looks very nice against my pale skin tone. I would definitely buy again, maybe even just to have extras.�These nostril hoops are 22 gauge 5/16.� ??I�ve been a professional piercer for a long time. Every now and then I�ll order jewelry from amazon just to see the actual quality of the jewelry. I also wanted to see what a 22g �gauge� nostril hoop looked like and possibly if any customers would need something this thin, and if they�re strapped for cash...��y�all need to stop putting thin metal in ???????� that�s why a lot of female lobe earring holes look torn. High quality jewelry can be pretty pricey, but there is a reason for it. Choose quality and proper gauge!Here�s what I say about these. The flatback part of the nostril hoop is pretty thick with it being a 22g 5/16. A standard nostril piercing gauge is 18g to 20g nowadays. Back in the early 2000�s a standard nostril hoop gauge was 16g. But over the years people didn�t like how thick they were and looked on a female and some guys.So nowadays the standard size is 18g-20g.The reason I�m telling y�all this is because if you go this tiny in gauge not only does it do a lot of wear and tear on your piercing hole, but it�ll also be harder to go back the standard size of nostril jewelry which is 18g. There are reasons why piercing places don�t use thin gauged jewelry.Overall on the quality of these nostril hoops, I don�t find them to be very good and they look cheap. Don�t get me wrong I�ve ordered other jewelry from here on amazon and for the price of quality and quantity some jewelry have been decent. Being 316L stainless steel that is. But in this case this company needs to put quality over quantity for the price. I hope this review helps yalls decision. And informs y�all about the gauge of metal these PCS are and to 4 warn you. Happy hunting! ??P.S. - These PCS are still sitting in my display case 4 months later, I can�t even give them away. To cheap looking.I'm always hunting for jewelry that doesn't irritate my skin, that doesn't cost an arm and a leg and that looks good. These check all the boxes. I love the variety of colors, the ease of adjustment and the overall look. Great buy !Second time ordering theses because I loose them. Whoops. Perfect fit for my small nose. The 6mm fits flat and snug. If you want a ring that confirms to you skin and doesn�t stick out these are for you!This are thin, just what I wanted. 22GNice packaging. Hope they don't tarnish.

It is firm in its shape and has the center support piece.I have not yet painted on these canvases, however I will post an update to my review with a photo once the piece is complete.Nice canvas but it�s not the thick style. That was my only disappointment. I should have read closer.When these canvases arrived, they were packed very well with no damage. The product itself was just what I needed for my future projects. I use this product to create oil or acrylic paintings, and love that the texture, the thickness, the bracing, everything is excellent. I can buy these canvases in bulk for a great price.

Party canopy wedding tent.I absolutely love this canopy! I was a little apprehensive after reading the reviews but this is exactly what I was looking for so I took the chance! It is huge and worked great for what I needed it for! It does take a while to put together the first time. My husband and I were able to assemble the top together. When putting the legs on we needed more people, just to make sure we didn't break anything. We had a total of 4 people and made it work. If you follow the directions and secure it properly with stakes it works wonderful! We've used this twice, the second time some rain and wind did hit us. We had it staked down and sandbags on a couple of the legs and it held up fine. I mean I wouldn't trust it in a tornado or a tropical storm, but it does fine with a bit of weather. The walls are great! I love the 'windows' on it! I haven't needed to put all the walls up even with just one side on it looks great! As you'll see in the pic, I hung lights from the frame, didn't bend or hurt it in any way. For the price, this was DEFINITELY worth it!Wow!! For the price, it�s amazing ! I mean, it�s not commercial grade by any means, but it did the job and made my party look like a million bucks! I even added extra fabric to the ends to make it look more luxurious. I bragged to my family members at the value you get. I�m in the mountains and it was very windy. FORTUNATELY, the feet had places for screws and also the railing as shown in the photo, helped because we put zip ties to it.There are a lot of parts but As long as you follow the instructions you should be able to build this with no problem. It�s just time consuming. Once it�s up it looks beautiful and does what it�s suppose to. We are pleased with this product.It was perfect, we added clear Christmas lights for my grandson�s b-party.

Text: nan2 stars granted to the talented artists who gave their all to provide us another beautiful chapter of 30 Days of Night. Ben Templesmith and Kody Chamberlain are now at the top of my favorite artists list.Two very talented writers shamed themselves when developing a concept for this installment. Steve Niles, who hasn't been my main reason to read the series, hit an all time low in Bloodsucker Tales. He made a so-so story with an idiot as a main character. I won't even begin to recall the main character's name, but the guy is so anti-dramatic and spacey. I constantly got this ""whoa dude"" vibe from him and nearly skipped panels to find an interesting character. The doctor was the highlight of the story. I enjoyed all the subplot involving the doctor, however it's too bad that my enjoyment only lied there.Now to Matt Fraction. You made Thor's Ages of Thunder! What happened? Lex Nova's drunken fiasco is like Devil's Rejects meets a Leslie Nielson spoof. Lex Nova, however original he is, is not a fascinating character. His noir narrative spoken aloud was just satire material. Since when did 30 Days of Night sink to the methods of a comedy. Again the highlights became the other characters, mainly the vampires. This is a terrible problem, because we need a main character to follow, not to hate. Lex Nova failed by the end of the book as Fraction's story turned into a disaster. I felt like I put all the pieces of the puzzle together and then Matt Fraction threw the puzzle off my desk for me to start over. The story makes absolutely no sense. You don't have to be intellectual or philosophical to understand this material. Fraction just got wasted and went backwards in storytelling. I will read it one more time to try and muster up some kind of clarification, but the first read was awful. Again, Lex Nova's story is just a mix-matched spoof of the series that loses any type of connection with the heart of the books.Artwork. That's it. These aren't some stories that are hard to crack and understand, like Grant Morisson's work. These stories just don't compare at all to the excellent volumes that precede them. These writers have talent, but they just did not access it this time around.The first story, ""Dead Billy Dead,"" written by Steve Niles and illustrated by Kody Chamberlain, is pretty good. The story is nothing great, but it's entertaining, but the art really stands out. It's very moody, with deep shadows and gorgeous coloring. I'd give it an ""A"".The second story, ""Juarez,"" by Matt Fraction and Ben Templesmith, started out great but completely becomes incomprehensible towards the end. This story is more complicated than the first one, and I respect that, but it's told in eight parts, the first six of which were really good, but the last two of which makes no sense at all. Overall, less enjoyable than the first, although I am a sucker for Ben Templesmith's artwork. I'd give it a ""B"".It's not great, but good enough entertainment. Kinda expensive though. So you might want to skip it. Fun, but not good enough of a value.I am not a big comic book guy. I own very few, but I find that the ones I do own get read pretty regularly.If you have any interest in the horror/vampire genre, then this is going to be a good choice for you. It is a well put together story that leads well into the follow up volumes.The only real complaint I have here is the art. It leans toward the abstract and while many would argue it fits in well with the dark over feeling of the work, I found it a bit distracting.Despite that, you are not likely to regret picking up this first entry in the series. If it's not quite for you, you can just stop right there.Niles and Fraction deliver odd, twisted and gruesome stories worthy of the bearing the ""30 Days of Night"" tag. Established fan favorite 30 Days artist Templesmith delivers his usual top notch visuals and you can see where he had a little fun playing with his style a bit to suit the story. Newcomer Kody Chamberlain proves he's ready to be part of the big show. His use of line, color and texture deliver his story in an engaging combination of classic illustration, modern horror comic and horror movie splatterfest.Just as many fans of the 30 Days Of Night books i have to say that this is the most uncool of them all. I wont focus on the plot itslef (both stories are fine) instead, i have to warn you, if you appreciate well done drawings, then this book is not for you. Kody Chamberlain's work is ..... well, see for yourself, if you have the chance to do a web search, check it out and then you decide.Ben Templesmith has proven that you dont need to be an excellent anatomist nor to have deep knowledge on prespective, you just need some creativity to make it work, in fact, Templesmith's drawings are so bad that they are cool and scary.Im really sorry to say that ""Bloodsucker Tales"" would have better stayed on the shelf from where i took it from.Its your call anyway.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanIt�s the middle of winter in Russia where the Nazi�s are busy killing every single Russian they can find. Russians are also out and about looking to kill all the Nazi�s and Russian citizens who are not loyal enough. The two groups join together with some citizens to fight Vampires, but the peace between the 3 doesn�t last long. With everyone betraying each other while they are all being picked apart by the Vampires. A last ditch effort to get away, will any survive?I liked this story line, when reading the previous comics I wondered why they didn�t talk about any towns in the Norther reaches of Russia which would also be plagued by the endless night at times. Now that story is told, but during WWII which makes it even better of a tale.The artwork in this one is FAR better than the originals. It was very easy to tell what was going on and that really increased my enjoyment of the comic. The writing was decent but typical.It�s available DRM Free via Comixology.This 30 Days of Night one-off on the Eastern Front is a Ben Templesmith solo arc, and probably my favorite 30 Days of Night stories so far. Unlike some of the Steven Niles arcs, Templesmith does not try to fit multiple character development and interactions into a fairly short-run story, thus under-developing some of the character development changes. Instead, Templesmith puts into the context of war and let's the history do the backstory for us. We aren't given elaborate insights into any of the characters, only a picture of the situation on the Eastern Front with ultra-violent vampires attacking in the bitter cold. The fight for survival in this one night stands alone, and all the characters are truly at risk given the later of overall plot necessity for anyone to survive. This distills the virtues of of 30 Days of Night without some of the problems I have come to link with the comic.First off let me say that since Ben Templesmith is the original illustrator it's wonderful that he got a shot at a story of his own. If you have read Singularity 7 or Wormwood(one of my favourites), you will enjoy the dark grittiness and the complete lack of regard towards the main characters well being. As such it was also nice to see that tragedy comes back in full force, you WILL feel sorry for the poor young Russian boy. I'm not going to divulge the name of all the characters because I think you should get to know them on your own. o.k. Then here we go.The Story. In a step back from 30 days of nights normal time plot this takes place during WWII in 1941. Hitler ordered a large squadron of soldiers to try to break into Northern Russia by way of Finland. Some get through but as a hole the mission fails miserably, and the remaining Germans, with a horribly masochistic leader, in the story are a result of this. While the remaining Germans are doing all they can eradicate any Russians they find the Russians are trying to survive the cold, warfare, and starvation. You meet a peasant family who have blockaded themselves into a barn who have plenty of food and underground tunnels. The is a brigade of Russian soldiers with a lone English soldier who speaks Russian and German. These are the main Humans in thr story. Then comes the blood thirsty undead led by an extremely creepy little girl and her much older male companion. The rest of the vampire are pretty much just fodder.The art. Since the story takes place in the winter of northern Russia during the many months of perpetual night there is a lot of snow( freaking duh) and things in the distance are blurred, such as it is during the night. There is plenty of blood and guts and the facial expressions on the characters give you sense of terror. As always I have found Ben Templesmiths artwork unique, and in a world dominated by big breasted anime characters( although nothing wrong with that), super shinny super heroes and horrible pretentious abstract artists, it's nice to see something a little different. His artwork is not by any means pretty but that is what caught my eye in the first place. It's a blend of computer generated colours, and after reading a new interview, painted. The colours in all of Ben's art are from a a collection of pictures he has taken for almost a decade which he then paints, and traditional outlining. If you end up liking his art from this i suggest you pick up Wormwood: Gentleman Corpse and Fell which is written by Warren Ellis and illustrated by Ben Templesmith.If i was going to complain about anything i would have to the length is a little short. Seeing as i grew up with the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen I got used to the length of that. It's also a good thing because it doesn't overstay its welcome. It gets what needs to be done done and it does it well. Overall this is a great addition to the 30 days of night series and I hope that he continues to add his talents to it.Loved this. the art is the traditional style 30 Days of Night. Big fan. I enjoy all they have to offer from the original run.The art work is frenetic and the ascendancy you in the gut! Very scary! Highly recommended for bloodthirsty fun! Must read!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: This 18""x24"" frame perfectly showcases your favorite photos, posters, or art prints.. Profile of each frame is 1. 125"" wide with a black woodgrain finish. Each frame is made of MDF wood with plastic styrene front to prevent breakage. Frames include pre-attached sawtooth hangers for vertical or horizontal wall hanging. Easy to open turn buttons make adding your photograph a breeze. Included Components: 1 FramenanThese are perfect frames. I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color. Overall I'm happy with the purchase! Doesn't look or feel like cheap frame material, so I think it's worth the price.Pro's:","Pro's:

Ideal for Android smartphones and tablets, and MIL camerasFor all the reviews saying the size isn't right (and thinking that means the cards are fake) you are not reading the description and you don't understand how hard drives, SSDs, flash drives, or memory cards are sold. This is an industry standard. Your computer reads things in multiples of 1,024... so 1,024 bytes is a KB, 1,024 KB is a MB... 1,204 MB is a GB, etc... But all drives are sold in multiples of 1,000. So if you buy a 512GB card, and do the math... device makers are saying that card is 512,000,000,000 bytes. But divide that by 1,024 and your operating system will see it as 476.84GB. Beyond that, you also lose a small percentage for the ""file system"" index on the drive. So you may see a few GB less even. In my case, I have a 256GB card, which shows up as 238GB, which is exactly as expected. The description on this listing explains this with the text:1MB=1,000,000 bytes. 1GB=1,000,000,000 bytes. 1TB=1,000,000,000,000 bytes. Actual user storage less.That explained, I tested my card's speed to see if it hits the 120MB/s ideal... not really. But marketing hype being what it is, I'm sure the ""Speed up to 120/MB/s**"" is in perfectly ideal conditions with specific readers and file sizes and the like... so my test of 93MB/s on a 10 year old USB 3 card reader with the SD adapter is acceptable to me. I think this should work fine on a soon to arrive Nintendo Switch for the kids. I'll update this review if any surprises come up that should be noted.Works great and is less than the Nintendo Branded one.Got the 1TB microSD on a deep sale to use for my Switch because I don't want to worry about storage for the rest of my mortal existence.Is 1TB overkill for a Switch? Probably.Should I have spent so much on a teensy piece of plastic? Eh.Does it work? Yup, 100%.Popped it in, re-downloaded my games, got back in the action. Highly recommended for anyone with a backlog that looks more like the inventory of a reputable, mid-sized game shop.I really like the Sandisk brand memory cards. Always works right out of the box, fast, and reliable (still have a working Sandisk memory card from 12 years back!). This one includes a SD adapter and comes pre-formatted. I used this one for a security camera I bought on amazon.Fast shipping i bought it for a rear view cam and it's working great. I had bought a different brand before this I wasn't happy with it cause it wasn't performing the way it should. I'm glad I bought ""sandisk "" I truly recommend it to anyone who is looking for good quality and true storage.Pro's:","Pro's:

KELTY CRAFTSMENSHIP: Kelty is synonymous with quality in the outdoor community, and for good reason. Kelty gear is built for play, and built to last. Designed in Colorado, and ready to be put through the ringer around the world (or in the backyard)..

It is very spacious and the vestibule porch is amazing! It has been rain tested in both light rain, and a moderate storm, and I have not noticed any leaking whatsoever. It's been left up in some moderate to high winds, as well, and stayed standing. There was some condensation on the first morning I checked on it, but it wasn't too bad. It's not been hot enough to truly test condensation, yet, though, in my opinion. That said, I'm just excited it doesn't leak during rain, stays standing with wind, is spacious, and has a porch.The tent was fairly easy to set up. I did it by myself. I have the 6 person version. I'm only 5'2"" so the rainfly portion was a bit difficult for me to get on, and likely quite comical for my neighbors to watch, but a taller person may not have as much issue with that. It would be easier with two people to set up the rainfly portion, probably. I found the tent portion to be easy enough on my own, overall, though.The poles are fiberglass, and they do shed some, so that sucked. I got some in my hand, and I hate that feeling. I used to do color guard in school, and my flag poles had that same issue. That part is probably the only real negative for me, on this tent, however.I haven't done a real camping trip, away from my property, yet, but when I do, if something changes, I'll update this review. For now, though, I would absolutely recommend this tent.I have added a ton of photos, as well.I�m 6�6� and have hop inside the tent without touching the top. I got the 5-6 person tent and I�ve had 8 people and 3 dogs in it. Great quality materials and I�m sure will hold up very well over the years of camping trips!Easy to assemble alone and without instructions.I love having a door on both sides of the tent, easy to use as a canopy or for leaving the tent without disturbing anyone else.Also great for day use or when it�s not raining because the entire tent from 2 feet up is net, so you have use it as a bug shield or for star gazing with friends.This is a perfect tent for a family or group of friendsGreat tent easy to assemble and pretty water resistant. ""4 person""The front porch is awesome! Has plenty of room to store your gear out of the weather and on those real rainy days their is enough room for you to sit and watch all those other people get all wet while they put up their tarps.I have several tents from Kelty. I am not sure what is going on but it seems like their prices are increasing and the quality is going downhill. This tent has a major problem with the vent on the top. It leaked on me for 2 days right in the middle of the tent dripping from the vent. It didn�t matter if I propped it up or left it down it leaked. There are several reviews like this. I would definitely not recommend this tent.Pro's:","Pro's:

I guess if there's no update added they last good because I'll only remember to update if I'm disappointed.Neanete,These LED lights bulbs for the bathroom vanity in our travel trailer are so much better than the regular light bulbs we had. The lighting is so much brighter. However, you have to make sure that the bottom of the bulb is the correct measurement and build for your fixture. Some of the bulbs have a wider base than others. Also, on the bottom sides of these types of bulbs, some may have one divot on the side and others may have two divots, one on each side. These divots are what hold the bulbs in place. My wife is very happy with these new bulbs. It was a great buy.6000k is too white for me. That color is not pleasant. They were easy to install.I�m going to order the same light bulb but in 3000k which is nicer.These were the last bulbs to be change to LED in our MH. All the lites are LED. I was surprised by the increased light output from these bulbs. My wife loves the cool white light and couldn't be happier. Would buy again.These bulbs are excellent quality easy to install and super bright. It lights up the vanity in the bathroom and my wife absolutely loves them.Pro's:","Pro's:

Using high-quality aluminum substrate design, better heat dissipation, corrosion resistance, extended service life high and temperature resistance, protect the original car power supply line, slow down the line aging. Three times brighter than halogen bulb but requires only 1/3 of the power consumption.. ?Buy with Confidence?: If you are using this 1073 bulb LED to replace the Turn Signal light, , you may need to add a pair of load resistors to prevent hyper/error flashing or malfunction problem ,depending on your vehicle electric circuit ? ( we will provide the perfect after-sales solution, Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions).So we bought ""warm lights"" from another Amazon seller, and they...were not warm. To say the least. The inside of my RV felt like the inside of an operating room � cold and sterile. So we tried these instead and OH MY GOD SO MUCH BETTER! LOL! Seriously though, if you like yellow / warm lights, these are the ones to buy. We've just thrown away the blue-white ""warm"" ones. Have already bought a second bag just to have as backups.I couldn't be happier with these bulbs as LED retrofit bulbs for RV ceiling lights. My RV has many old incandescent light bulbs in its ceiling lights and sconces and they run hot and I know they use a lot of power. The previous owner was starting to retrofit LED lighting into the rig, but the color temperature of the bulbs they were using, along with the bulbs having a number of dead LED elements and flickering was kind of a turn off, and made me want to try to do my own thing.These are the more appropriate soft white light color, not the bright, cool light temperature, the bulbs do not flicker in operation and do not seem to be affected by extreme temperatures, especially when the rig is cold and you switch on the lights. Light dispersion is excellent, you don't see the individual LED elements through the lens of the ceiling light (opaque lens), the light they emit behaves very similarly to incandescent lights.Bulbs stay cool in their mount. With the old incandescent lights, the light fixture and the lens would get hot to the touch, but with these LED lights, there is only a slight warmth when you touch the lens and no heat in the light fixture itself. Very impressive.So you want to change those inefficient, too-hot-to-touch incandescents..maybe in your camper or rv, but don't like the cool ""blue"" tint? Well so was I! And based on the number of positive reviews, these seemed like the bulbs. Installation was easy, just plug in and turn on! And they are BRIGHT! Easily twice as bright as the ""old"" incandescents. I hear you asking ""But what about the color? That blue tint? What about that?"" These are advertised as ""warm white"" but my experience has shown that may or may not mean anything in regards to color. Anyway, these are definitely ""warmer"" than the ""normal"" LEDs. They aren't as warm as the incandescents they replace, keep in mind. The color resembles that of a brand new halogen (just minus the heat.) As far as longevity, time will have to tell, but I am glad that I found these even if they only last as long as the incandescents.So have had this product for a few months and seems to be working fine . I installed in a old camper to replace the old style bulbs.1- I have less drain on the 12 volt marine battery and it doesn�t add heat to the camper in summer2-originally I wanted a �yellowish � type bulb to have above the bed instead of white but when the covers go on it�s fine -3- good amount of light for hallway4- I wasn�t going high watts when I bough my his volt type due to the draw and not charging battery in camper often5- great replacementThese lights are wonderful! They are a bit brighter than the original bulbs that were in my 1994 trailer. Not sure on the run time, but I know it beats what was in there before!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Protects against algae and bacteria for water that stays clean, clear and free of visible algae. Kills all types of pool algae and kills bacteria. Protected against sunlight to last longer. Packaging may varyNothing more I can say about these except they are great and balance the water extremely well. I have alot of water evaporation where I live and this seems to work well with tablets like these. HTH also has comparable tabs but Clorox has come into the picture with a very good product worthy of using. These are 3"" white tabs but with some additional compounds to balance water and keep it that way. You can't go wrong with these for a pool like mine. I have concrete with plaster and a painted surface. It's holding up well. Keeping chemicals balanced will keep the surface longer and I am seeing this first hand. Good product hereI was able to clean my pool better since I change to these tablets. I was having difficulties keeping the algae at bay. I just reorder another larger container, 35lbs. I'm a bit concern that this one is not the same as my current batch, because the descriptions are not the same on the container. I hope that they are the same. I will update once my order arrived. Highly recommend the 25lb size because it works on a;lgea very well.We've been using the Leslie's tablets in our spa for years, and I decided to try this because I've been very happy with the Clorox copper product.First, the ""safety"" packaging for this backfired rather badly: My handyman has COPD and after he struggled to figure out how to open the container, he got too close when it opened and got a snoot full of chlorine gas, because not only is the box hard to open, but the tablets are not individually wrapped. Not individually wrapped is also a disadvantage in use, because I use the wrapper to fine-tune the amount of chlorine going through the float. These produce a big spike of chlorine but don't last as long. The tablets are less compressed than Leslie's and dissolve more quickly.When I'm done with this box, I'm switching back.Love the Clorox line of pool care products but twice now I have inhaled toxic fumes from the packages, first in a store where a cloud of chlorine dust came out of a package and now the tabs delivered to me the entire container is was boxed in reaked of Chlorine enough to choke me. This product needs to have an outer wrapper or the bucket needs to have a seal as the fumes are horrible. Even the delivery guy said how it filled his truck. This is a dangerous product when inhaled into the lungs. Now everyone makes a version and this has other products mixed with it that saves me a fortune in other chemicals and balances the pool very well when used with weekly shock by Clorox that is a 6 in one product. Now it is sealed great and emits no smell from the outside of the package.We used these all summer in our inground pool and they were perfection! We did not have to add a single other chemical to keep the levels where they needed to be. Our water was crystal clear all summer and that�s with 2 big dogs swimming in the pool daily, tracking in grass and dirt. All we did was throw 2 in each skimmer, vacuumed the pool when needed and that was the extent of it. Absolutely worth the money!Pro's:","Pro's:

""Lift and Pull"" for opening and closing the sliding screen top;. With a transparent PVC tray for holding water and substrate;. Easy to install within 2 minutes, suitable for reptile pets, small animails such as hamster hedgehog etcAccording to the reviews on other similar products this product negates being broken in packaging by shipping flat for you to put together. It goes together with ease, it's sturdy, it looks SO nice, it's got a sliding lid instead of just a cap. Because it comes in pieces they include a small clear pvc tray to line the bottom with and in my bio tank I can't even tell it's there.Already purchased another and anytime I need a 10 gallon enclosure that doesn't need standing water it'll be this one.UPDATE: Turns out the first tank I received was defective. They kindly sent me a replacement and it works perfectly! It's very easy to put together and this time the top slid in properly! Perfect for my garters.The sliding top does NOT slide easily. It's very hard to open, and it took me about 10 mins to get the top slid in the first time!I purchased two of these, only had a minor issue with a single screw hole on one of them, nothing a little torquing couldn't handle though. Pretty straight forward assembly, be sure to remove the film on the rubber strips. I prefer the dimensions of these (20"" L, 12"" W, 10"" H) compared to a standard 10-gallon tank (20"" L, 10"" W, 12"" H). It gives my herps more room to move around. A bit pricey, but so far worth the money. I also like the fact that these can easily be disassembled.This is a great aquarium for the price. We use it for our hermit crabs so the sand is a little bit of a nuisance to clean out because the sides aren�t totally sealed together. Other than that it is really nice and gave my crabby ladies lots more space. The top slides easily but we don�t lock it since the netting is held up by the lid agains the back side of the tank. I�d say this definitely holds its own compared to more expensive tanks.Our leopard gecko loves his new home. So easy to clean, roomy and allows for lots of interactive status for him to climb on.Pro's:","Pro's:

Full range air direction control, slide-out filter access. Window mounting kit included. Voltage : 110-120 V. Minimum Operating Temperature (Cooling) : 60 degrees F. cULus listed, refrigerantHusband installed this last night in our tiny attic windows. This area is a studio, workplace for me so it gets super hot pretty quickly. We are currently having a cool spell so I cant speak on how fast it takes to cool down aprox. 400 sq ft. just yet. Wanted to speak specifically on it being shipped with its own support bracket! I was pleasantly surprised it had one (must have missed it in the description). He needed to rig a couple of boards to make it fit our sills, however this will work! Time from unpacking to install/power was just about 1.5 hrs. This even included him cutting a few boards to fit our sills. Thankful I ran across this casement AC as the only other unit that would possibly fit these window would be a swamp cooler. Who wants to carry dehumidifier water up and down steep attic stairs... not this girl!As with any window unit, it is not the quietest, but nothing you cant get used to. Its a window unit... not a whole house unit!I absolutely love this air conditioner! Back when my home was built in the 1920's, all but the front window are quite narrow, how they were all used back then. Growing up the only air conditioners that fit in the dining room window was a 5,000btu. For the size of the house that size didn't do much good. Over the years companies started making all different size/shape/style air conditioners. Last summer the portable one I had blew out so I started researching the newer models for this summer. I saw this one advertised for a great price, measured my window & asked my brother if I'd be able to use this in a double hung window since it's labeled for a sliding or crank window. We measured the sq ft of the 1st floor, read all the info listed for this & he said it wouldn't be a problem. I had no problem ordering it & delivery was quick. The only issue was the top has a small dent in it. It took my brother about 20 mins to have the rack set, the air conditioner in, locked in place & winterized sealed. It works great! This is the best air conditioner the house has ever had. I HIGHLY recommend it.Have used one for over a year and am buying another one to replace a different model on our second floor. One thing I really like is that it has the option to only run until the temperature setting is reached then stop. The one I'm replacing the fan runs all night no matter what. Also this model is quieter than the one I'm replacing. Overall a great unit, highly recommended. I ran a separate 20A circuit for this though someone said 15A is fine.Arrived with minor damage that I'm not too upset about but did take that one star away. Otherwise, this unit is excellent. It's quieter than our last one and cools just as well. The price I paid convinced me quickly that some cracked plastic on a bottom corner isn't a big enough problem to send it back and risk it being out of stock and therefore ending up paying ~200 dollars more for another one with a different logo on the case.All of these casement units no matter what brand name are on them are all made by the same manufacturer (I forgot their name) So it doesn't matter if it says LG, or Whirlpool, Frigidaire, or Perfect Aire or any one of a dozen other names that might be on the case. All of the casement style ones are made in the same place. Your current choices are 8k btu and 10k btu and you might find old stock of 12k btu, but they aren't currently being made. ... So, figure out if 8k btu or 10k btu is right for your needs and then find the one with the best number on the price tag and buy it.The seller went above and beyond to get it to me on time. Not sure what slowed the process down but the day before it was due to arrive prime shipping, I got a notice they were overnighting it to me. That had to cost a fortune, but they did it. I'm impressed that they took their promise of 3 day shipping so seriously that they paid overnight on an 85lb package to get it to me on time.I mentioned some shipping damage. The plastic on one corner is busted up a bit. I would have preferred no damage, but it isn't so bad that I want to go through the hassle of sending it back. Also, it looks like someone's knee flattened out a knee-sized section of the fins in the back of the unit. I'll take a plastic shim in between the flattened fins and spread them apart one of these days to make sure air can move between them. Also not a really big deal. I'd have rathered it arrived in perfect condition, but considering the price and the sellers willingness to do what they said they'd do... I don't mind too much. I'm capable of fixing that myself.I mentioned that this unit is quieter than our last one and I also mentioned that all of these are manufactured by the same company no matter whose logo ends up on them. The old unit got loud during its 3rd year in service. As they age, they develop some rattles and the fan starts getting choked up by dirt and debris (easily fixed with a pressure nozzle on a garden hose if you just hose it out at the end of every season) But, no matter what, as the compressor ages, it will get noisy. One could pull the case off after each season and lubricate mechanical parts like the fan etc and tighten up all screws that have worked loose from constant vibration, but this unit will be louder and louder the longer it remains in service. Some of that can be mitigated by general maintenance and care, but even with proper care, the more hours it runs, the louder it will get.I'm pleased with how this unit functions. And, I'm pleased that the seller was willing to go the extra mile to make sure I got it on time. All in all, this was an excellent purchase experience sans the damaged plastic corner and flattened fins I already mentioned.Cools very well. It is very heavy so get someone to help you install. Also purchase your own (padding/to put around the sides. What comes with is pretty skinny and flimsy. Overall I like this. I have 2 of themPro's:","Pro's:

A great external hard drive for Mac and Windows, this hub can charge mobile devices and transfer files from USB cameras and USB thumb drives via its 2 USB 3.0 ports. Use seamlessly between Windows and Mac by installing the provided NTFS driver for Mac. Complimentary four-month membership to the Adobe Creative Cloud Photography Plan�s photo and video editing apps (Must be redeemed within 1 year of drive registration. Not available in all countries)I accepted delivery of a Seagate Backup Plus Hub 6TB External Desktop Hard Drive Storage STEL6000100 from Amazon.com on December 20, 2017. For a period of about 30 days it performed as expected. Quiet and dependable. However, beyond that point, my HP Pavilion Desktop 570-p094 running on Windows 10, failed intermittently to recognize the drive. Upon restarting my computer, the problem seemed to self rectify. This condition persisted for several weeks. Lamentably, shortly thereafter, the drive began making grinding and chattering noises. After which point, my computer no longer recognized the drive. I have attempted to utilize ""SeaTools for Windows"" to no avail. It also failed to detect the drive. Additionally, I unsuccessfully attempted to initialize the drive with any of the available USB ports on my computer. The drive is neither detected within the Device Manager nor Disk Management.I have had several rounds of emails with Seagate Support which ultimately concluded with the recommendation of returning the drive for replacement. Seagate stipulated though, as follows: ""Please be advised, Seagate may replace your product with a product that was previously used, repaired, and tested to meet Seagate specifications."" Not much comfort there, considering that the new unit that I purchased presumably also met Seagate specifications. I do not find it acceptable that I should have to front the cost of return shipping. Nor do I feel any confidence in the security of my personal data contained on the drive should I return it to Seagate. The only resolution that I would find acceptable would be to have Seagate send a new drive to replace the doorstop that I now own. I would happily destroy it upon receipt of a new replacement. But then there is the reality of the personal data that is now lost.I do not write reviews. However, to this I am making an exception due to the sudden, complete, and catastrophic failure of this drive. As a consequence, I have lost irreplaceable photos and documents. Common wisdom advises the back up of data. This was precisely my reason for the purchase of this drive. I backed up the internal hard drive of a computer that I recently whiped and discarded. Back-up the back-up the back-up? Where does it end?Do a bit of research before buying this product. You will find independent reviews that determine that some Seagate products are unreliable, defective, and (fail) prematurely at spectacularly, and in many respects, unprecedentedly high rates. That is most certainly true of this product. At the time that I am writing this review, nearly 150 of the 1,151 Amazon customer reviews are solidly negative. This drive should stop shipping until the manufacturing defects are corrected.Every component of my budget system operates flawlessly with the exception of this pathetic device.Please read the warranty and take the negative reviews seriously.I know one can get a ""lemon"" sometimes, but how Seagate's customer service dealt with the matter left me discouraged. Seagate states they provide a 2 year warranty, but let me share with you my experience in dealing with the dead drive covered by support/warranty ... The product was purchased about 90 days ago, but was not used for several weeks; and thereafter, usage was light (for example, Time Machine backups for a couple laptops). Then after about 2 months of use it died last week. I attempted to locate another adapter to confirm that the adaptor was not the issue, but was unable to locate the unique one that comes with this unit (Seagate power supply: 12V 3A / barrel outside 5.5mm inside 2.5mm center positive). Therefore, I contacted customer service regarding the matter and they asked me to purchase one to test their drive. Yes, they wouldn't send me a replacement adaptor to test their product, but rather wanted me to purchase one. So with that support interaction, I elected to return the unit under their product warranty coverage. That is when I was informed that they only warranty the product and DO NOT cover sending the product back to them to replace. And BTW, their warranty replacement unit will be a refurbished unit, not a new one ... another surprise in warranty coverage. Today I mailed the drive to Seagate, and my wallet is another $20+ dollars lighter ... YIKES. Therefore, due to the experience of the unit's life (60 days with light usage) and Seagate's support/warranty, I have to rate this product a ZERO!Update, December 2018I've been using this for 21 months to back up my MacBook Pro hourly with Time Machine. No problems at all, still works (and sounds, thumpety thump) like it has from the start.Original reviewThe Backup Plus Hub series appears to consist of SMR (Shingled Magnetic Recording) drives. We know the 8 TB version is SMR because another reviewer (Pacific coast) opened it up (voiding his warranty) and found a Seagate Archive drive, which is SMR. I asked Seagate if the 6 TB version I got is an SMR drive, and they said ""Unfortunately, we do not have this information available."" Ha ha! Their reticence is understandable, the more common PMR (Perpendicular Magnetic Recording) technology is generally preferred. The prices of these Backup Plus Hub drives are less than Seagate's bare PMR drives of equal capacity, which also supports the idea that the Backup Plus Hub series is SMR.SMR technology allows more physical bits of memory in the same space without decreasing the size of the bits.Advantages of SMR-- Fast burst sequential writes are possible due to higher density and allied technology.-- Larger drive capacities in same-size enclosures.-- Cheaper to produce in large capacities.Disadvantages of SMR-- Slower random writes. SMR drives use large write heads relative to the width of the tracks of bits, so writing one track affects the next tracks of bits too. This limits SMR drives to sequential writing, where the next tracks don't matter. To do random writes (such as changes to data on the drive already), data must be arranged sequentially in cache, by the drive in this case, and entire sections of the drive must be rewritten sequentially. Some of this can be hidden by the use of large cache on the drive, believed to be 20 GB or more on Seagate SMR drives. Data can be written quickly to cache and then rewritten more slowly to another part of the drive.-- Highly variable sequential write speeds, due to the particular ways the drive manages where to put data.Read speeds aren't affected as much.The consensus about SMR drives is that they're well suited to backup use, which is reflected in the name of this series of drives. They probably aren't as suitable to use as a main drive to run a computer from, and are generally *not* recommended for RAID configurations (which wouldn't be likely uses for a single external drive anyway).Real-life speedsThe 6 TB version of this drive hasn't been tested by professional reviewers, but the 8 TB version has tested very well in standard benchmarks in numerous professional reviews, often well over the 160 MBs maximum rate claimed by Seagate. It's been more variable in practical use. I'm unable to test it myself with a USB 3.0 connection, but one professional reviewer who did got an average of 72 MB/s for a write of a little under 90 GB of files. That's a little over 20 minutes. (A customer review here--Pacific coast again--gets a similar 75 MB/s.)[Update December 2018: Someone asked for speed test now that it's two years old, and since I have a USB 3.0 connection for it now, I was able to test it at full speed. For 20GB of photos from my MacBook Pro it took right about 3 minutes, or 110MB/s write speed. To copy them back took just over 2 minutes, about the rated 160MB/s read speed. I've only used 450GB of the 6TB capacity, so it's not congested yet.]Differences between Windows and Mac versionsAccording to Seagate, the only differences between this Windows version and the Mac version of the Backup Plus Hub series are the initial formatting of the drives and the cosmetics of the cases. The formatting can easily be changed at home, so buy whichever drive you please for either OS.System requirements-- Windows 7 or later-- Mac OS 10.7 or later-- for Mobile Backup app: iOS 8 or higher, Android 3.0 or higherOther points-- Doesn't run too hot. I've seen measured temps of 100 and 113 degrees inside, which is fine for a hard drive.-- A little noisy when operating, not any worse than most computers.-- No fan, has passive cooling through vents on the bottom.-- Includes USB 3 (or 2) cable, type A to micro-B.-- 2-year warranty.Beware don't buy this hard drive, this is utter garbage hard drive, from the first the day it came I plugged it into my laptop it was making weird clicking and clattering noise even when it was not reading or writing and then comes surprise when i started copying data on this drive which was a nightmare i was merely getting 50mbps over usb3.0 and when i tried copying my 2tb data on it from my passport drive it was copying at 20mbps showing 3 days to complete and all the time it was clicking and clattering as if it was going to fail any minute, this all this is because SEAGATE HAS USED AN ARCHIVE HDD IN THIS BACKUP PLUS WHICH USES SMR TECHNOLOGY PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS DRIVEI didn't Got the Bill and Warranty Card in courier.

Text: ?Strong and Sturdy Frame: 10 x 20ft. Full Truss Structure of powder-coated 1mm thick square shaped legs and strong cross truss bars is very sturdy, which can withstand 50 km/h wind with the sandbags, ropes and stakes. Good looking and rust resistant.. ?Plural Sidewalls: 4 plain sidewalls and 2 door walls with zipper in the middle are made of 210 Denier polyester fabric coated with PU. Every sidewall is removable, zipper ended, easy to attach and detach.. ?Large Space: 10 x 20 Pop Up Canopy with straight legs provides a true 200 square feet shade. Big enough for about 6-10 people to sit under it. Center height is 132 inch. Suitable for market stalls, parties, picnics or any other outdoor events. This commercial canopy tent is suitable for both sunny and rainy days.. ?Package Includes: 10x20 Canopy, 6 Sidewalls, 6 Sandbags, 6 Ropes, 6 Stakes and a Wheeled Bag, which is made of 600D polyester fabric coated with PVC with reinforced handles. Canopy top is made of 500 Denier polyester PU coated fabric, which is water-resistant and can effectively reflect 99% harmful UV rays.. ?Excellent Service: 1 year for replacements of the frame. 6 months for replacements of other parts. If it�s possible that the product has a manufacturing defect, we�re always ready to help.Amazon delivered this in TWO days and although they didn't follow my delivery instructions, it arrived in great condition and so soon.As the instructions will tell you, it is easier to put together with two or more people. But once I got everything laid out it just took some extra grunting, about thirty minutes and a few ugly words to have this baby set up all by myself.The canopy seemed of decent quality and the frame seemed study enough. I would almost tell you to bolt up the wheels on the carry/cover/cart/crate do-hickie AFTER removing the frame from within, but if you have help it shouldn't matter.I suppose at this point (just received it) I only have one complaint: when the manufacturer engineered the handy 'carry bag' as they call it they didn't leave much room for 'just in cases'. Such as: Just in case you need to fold it up and move it quickly to another location and wanted to leave the actual Top portion on but put the whole canopy in it's handy carry bag for protection - BARELY ENOUGH ROOM. Or if you were to remove the top and try to place it in the handy side pocket on the handy carry bag cart thingy - NOT ENOUGH ROOM for the top, BARELY ENOUGH ROOM for the side panels if you leave the Velcro side exposed, and with the side panels in in the side pocket - ABSOLUTELY NO ROOM for the Top or the sand/water/weight bags that MasterCanopy so thoughtfully included with your purchase. Perhaps the clever, crafty engineers can come up with some caliber of consolation for the consumer. If they do, please contact me with info on that newly revised, handy carry bag/cart whatchamacallit. To all of you fellow consumers, I hope you enjoy your sweet, sunblocking, super good time canopy as much as I Hope to.After a farmers market season of subpar tents we finally ordered this one. It arrived a few days after the original date promised but I feel it was well worth the wait and I would do it again. This tent pops up easily with one person (if you know what you're doing) and the material is tough. The side panels are sturdy and attach easily to this tent. The bag is also quality and securely wraps the tent up and out of the way. You have to attach the wheels to the tent bag yourself but that takes no time at all. After the 5 tents we've gone through this season this is a welcome relief. (We have not been particularly hard on the tents - the just keep breaking.) I wish we had started with this one! Definitely top quality!We purchased this canopy when the awning on our camper was damaged. When our camper broke down, this canopy SAVED THE DAY! It became our kitchen and sheltered living space on a fall camping trip to the banks of the Saint Lawrence River. It withstood a monsoon-like rain and wind storm and the sides kept all of our belongings dry and secure. Our weekend would have been a complete and utter loss had it not been for this sturdy and easy to erect canopy.This arrived all nicely packaged and look very nice. It seemed like the perfect canopy for what I needed. And then it all hit the fan� The video makes it look so easy to put up. Such a lie, the directions suck and it took 4 strong people to figure it out wrangle this thing up. It was needed to temporarily store items from the basement so the floor could be refinished. First rain, and not even a hard rain, (and the day before the movers were scheduled to to come unload the basement) the darned thing collapsed and snapped 3 of the upper support pieces. I thought I could fold it back reasonably into shape and find someone to replace the damaged metal pieces. After 2 months of trying to find someone to help and trying to collapse it with the help of my brother and neighbor, we gave up and I gave it away to the first person to come and get it out of my back yard. He couldn�t tame it into submission and ended up unscrewing and dismantling the whole thing. I am angry that I wasted my money on this thing. I lost the deposit on the movers and on the basement refinished for having to cancel at the last minute. I would give it negative stars if I could.Bought it to replace a disastrous $100 product of the same size (which collapsed in a rain shower 24 hours after assembly). This product is sturdy, and went from box to fully assembled and tied down in 30 minutes. Been through a couple of storms so far, with no mishapsPro's:","Pro's:

These are bright white, cool to the touch after being on a while and take far less energy to use. I saw similar bulbs at the auto parts store, you got two bulbs for $19.99, I paid $18.99 for 20 bulbs and am very pleased with the purchase and have told friends that have similar travel trailers to convert to these LED bulbs, BUY THEMI got these bulbs as a more energy efficient alternative to the stock bulbs in my trailer. Wr are off-grid full-time so energy moderation is vital.Within minutes of illuminating the new bulbs, the plastic housing aka light fixture around the new bulbs started to melt. This completely changes the clarity of the light and is a huge disappointment.Depicted on the left is one of four melty fixtures. On the right is one that I didn�t not put a new bulb in, twenty years old and pristine. The final photo is of the beautiful bright light that scorches.Buyer beware and consider other (maybe better quality) LED bulbs for your rig.From the picture you can see the left side with the led bulb and the right side with a stock rv bulb. The led bulbs are so much brighter and give a daylight brightness to the rooms in my travel trailer. Would highly recommend.What a difference between these and the incondescent bulbs I was using! Almost too bright! In the double light fixtures I left the incandescent bulbs in the first switch and then one of these in the second. That way I have a softer light in one click and very bright light in second click.I like the intensity of these lamps, but the white is a bit too ""hard"" (cool) of a color temperature for my liking to use as main lighting. Think fluorescent lighting from the 70s and you'll know what I mean. As such, these are relegated to the basement storage of the RV, and I will be using the ""warm"" version of this for the interior. This is certainly not a fault of the lamp, nor the seller... it's just something that you'll have to discover and experience on your own to determine if they're suitable for your application. Time will tell how well they hold up, and I will update this review if I experience any premature failures.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: MULTIPLE FRAMES COLLAGE:Bulk of 5 pieces Picture Frames set in the same Sizes.Perfect for Pictures 8.5x11 with Mat or 12x16 Without Mat.. SAFE MATERIAL:These frames light but firm,has plastic cover instead of glass,when they fall to the ground you won't worry about hurting the kids.. EASY MOUNTING:Spring type action to remove the backing,can be hung horizontally or vertically.. GIFT& BE MERRY:Our 12x16 frame set not only the simple yet classic design for any home or office decor, but also a heartfelt gifts for everyone.. INTACT PARTS AND PACKING:5pcs Non-traces are included.Protective Packaging let you don't have to worry about receiving damaged products.All in all they are pretty flimsy. The front is plastic, not glass. But for the price you can�t beat them and once they�re on the wall they look great! They come with the mat & a hanging device too which is a plus! I got 20 for a gallery wall and I couldn�t be happier with the outcome. One frame front was scratch and the company was easy to contact and work with and offered to send me another frame hassle free.the plastic ""glass"" slightly bows out. You can tell with light reflection. Other than that the turn button hinges on back hold really well and the frames plus mats look great.These frames are GREAT for the money! I ordered 4 Fornite prints from Amazon, and used these frames for those, and they look amazing! They will go in my sons game room. If you know anything about really nice high end frames, they are EXPENSIVE! So if you are expecting some show stopper frames for your living room, and want to show off your priceless family pictures.....these are not the frames for you! These frames are black plastic frames with some sort of plexiglass for the glass, and you get a 5 pack for this price.....it's great! The fact that they also come with a mat, is fantastic! I got 8 x 10 Fortnite photos and were able to make them look larger, and more stunning with the white mat. The only thing I can complain about is that the plexiglass has TWO of those peel offs, on each side which I thought was a little bit of an overkill, but hey.....if the only thing I can complain about is extra protection for quality control, that says a lot. For the folks that want to complain these were ""hard to hang"", then I guess they've never hung a picture, because every photo I've ever hung in my entire life was hard to hang. Unless you use command strips........and I think these are too thin for command strips. You might be able to hang it with a nail/screw, and then use a command strip to make sure it doesn't ""shift"" on the wall.I bought two sets of these for my gallery wall and they�re exactly what I was looking for. They aren�t glass but they look really clear so it didn�t bother me.I used 3M command strips to hang since they�re super light but it did come with nail hooks. Totally worth the price!!!Good bang for the buck. They�re not high end gallery frames/matte/glass. But, they are awesome for quickly matting, framing a photograph. The film on both sides of the plastic (not glass) takes a second to figure out how to remove, but afterwards removes easily. The frames are worth the price point, ship nicely in a box with little chance of damage in-transit to your house. Buy a few, or a few different sizes from this brand at these prices, you�ll finally frame those photographs you�ve been meaning to!Pro's:","Pro's:

Energy saver feature complete with timer/lock function and 61-decibel sound rating.This unit is quieter than my last one and does a good job cooling the master bedroom. I'm waiting to see how well it does when the summer sun gets hotter here. The only downside is the remote. When it's dark in the room, we can't see the remote face and need to turn on a light to make adjustments. Eventually I'll memorize it but if B&D would illuminate the face, it would be much better. Still worthy of 5 stars.Our central AC went out during a heat wave and AC repair was scheduling three weeks out. We grabbed this unit in a pinch for our bedroom, while temps stayed well above 105 it kept our south facing bedroom like an ice box�just like we like it:)I finally installed this a.c after having it a couple of weeks because of the weather down here in the east and it works great. Blows ice cold air with alot of punch behind it and the remote works just fine. I'm giving this unit 2 thumbs up. I looked for a better deal and couldn't find it.. definitely would highly recommend for sure! Thanks guys for excellent packaging as wellIt cools off more than 700 sq ft. It is so cold in the house. It is energy efficient so turns off and on.My only complaint is there being no batteries in the remote control. I just purchased this unit, this far everything is fine. The installation was easy which was a plus.Pro's:","Pro's:

It's ideal for a wide range of outdoor functions, such as shows, wedding, exhibition, parties, BBQ, camping trips, festivals and so on. You can also set it up in your backyard as a large sunshade for your family and guests. Also can be used as a temporary garage for store your garden furniture, or tools.. ?PREMIUM POLYESTER MATERIAL?The gazebo canopy is made of PA coating polyester which is heavy-duty, water-resistant, UV protected and fade-resistant. It offers 99% UV protection.. ?STURDY & DURABLE FRAME?The column and beamis of our patio gazebo are constructed of aluminum, against rust, corrosion.Sturdy heavy duty steel frame on the top of the gazebo, which help to keep the gazebo's shape.. ?MOSQUITO NETTING AND CURTAINS INCLUDED?Mosquito netting is artfully arranged around the beams and keeps out bugs, mosquito,letting you enjoy the beauty of the outdoors with friends and family late into the evening.When the weather is very hot, the curtains will isolate the sunlight and bring you cool.. ?Easy TO ASSEMBLE?You can assemele this garden backyard gazebo by following the instruction in package and only some common household tools are needed.We advice you to do this work with 1-2 people and it will take about 0.5-1.5 hours to finish it .The first thing I noticed was that the fabric was quite a bit heavier than I was expecting! Next, since I am a short, handicapped, 67 yr old woman with NO help, I had to plan my ""attack"" on installing this monster! Fortunately there were very few instructions to confuse the process so after a quick glance of how things fit together, I was able to ""improvise""...substituting for those 2 extra bodies with some rope and a few bungee straps! (Relax!!! I do have 30+ years of construction experience)I first put together 1 of the short sides (nearest the 16' high end of my deck), then attached 1 long rail to a 3rd column (This is where the bungee cords came in....holding the rail in place while I was getting the 3rd post lined up) I wasn't crazy about having to temporarily secure each post with a framing nail but in lieu of someone to help hold the post in place, that worked!So, now with the 2 sides rails up that are next to my 2nd story deck railing, I was ready to move to the inside rails....and my 3rd glass of wine! Those 2 rails went up without a hitch, but I was still only on my 4' step ladder!Now, for the top! I managed to drag my 6' ladder from the garage to the deck and proceeded to assemble the top frame. It helps greatly IF you do NOT tighten down the rails completely when assembling the rectangular outer frame. You'll need a little ""play"" to get the top frame in place. I loosely attached the ""screwed"" down bars, 1 on each long side and then inserted the longer bars in each of the 4 corners, then went back to place the other 2 shorter screw down bars (and to retrieve another glass of wine!) Then I went around the whole frame with my 3 ft. level, making sure that all my posts were plumb while tightening every screw!Next! Putting on the fabric top! So, but this time I've nearly had enough wine to spend the next HOUR stretching the canvas over the frame....working off my 6' ladder....tugging and twisting,up and down the ladder trying to keep the hooks in place while I stretch the canvas over a few more feet! FINALLY, the hard part....DONE. MORE WINE, then I hang the screens and curtains, once again, check for plumb, drill pilot holes in my deck and screw the post bases to the deck! (Oh, and drink more wine!)So, don't believe all the horror stories you may read. This installation was a breeze.....even for a lone OLD lady who has enough screws in clamps in her back to build a small deck of it's own! Oh, total time to construct....about 6 1/2 hours.The product runs true to description, in regard to size. 13x10. The legs are hollow but thick and strong. The tarp on top, as well as the curtains, are thicker than I was expecting and keeps rain out well. The mosquito netting is also solid. I did notice during a heavy rain that a little bit of water got in through the top, but again, it wasn't a normal rain. The wind was blowing too so that had something to do with it. These a little opening up top between the main tarp and top tarp for venting, so I expected this and it wasn't a big deal. The rest of it kept rain out perfectly.My complaint would be with the directions. All pictures and 4-5 steps shoved into one step on each page. It took a bit to decipher what we were supposed to do. My wife and I took around 5 hours to get everything done, including curtains and netting, so make sure you have time to set it up. Also, make sure you screw it to the ground. Based on reviews and research, these things go flying if not secured very well, and sand doesn't seem to be great. Our tacon screws are holding it down perfectly.All in all its great for the price. We did a ton of research and this seemed to be the best of price, quality and features.This is a great product and well worth the money. Two people put it together in a couple of hours.I would, STRONGLY, recommend that you lay out ALL of the parts and conduct an inventory to ensure you have everything you need before you get started. Nothing is worse than getting really involved in project only to realize half way in that you don�t have something (in my opinion).Package arrived undamaged and was a little heavy and awkward to lift and carry to its intended location. Have a hand truck or another person around to help you (or simply drag it if the other two options are not viable).Assembly goes smoothly as long as you exercise patience and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FIRST so you know exactly what�s required.I secured the Gazebo to my deck and thus far it has performed beautifully during some pretty wild rainstorms with high winds. No tearing, no leaks, no problem.Purchasing a gazebo with the mosquito netting as well as privacy curtains was a must have for me. I did not want to continue shopping for whichever one I did not have when I ordered this item.Now I can enjoy my deck at night without being on the dinner menu for all the bloodthirsty insects which come out just looking to zero in on a tasty meal. Just something to think about...Sturdy, well made. The curtains are heavy material. Very nice. Very impressed with the size and ease of assembly. Great price. I was going to spend $650 at Lowe�s for something smaller, and I�m glad I checked amazon and this turned out to be great for $330! Definitely recommending.We really like this canopy. It is very sturdy, attractive and great value for the money.Properly anchored with weighted sandbags it has withstood several southeast Louisiana thunderstorms without any problems.Be sure to have at least two people when putting canopy together.The canopy arrived with a dented post and a couple of canopy clips that were slightly out of alignment.Fortunately this company's customer service is OUTSTANDING! I was a bit concerned as communication was only by e-mail and I wasn't able to speak to anyone directly. Their response was the next business day and all issues were taken care of to our complete satisfaction.Pro's:","Pro's:

At 57dB, this unit is among the quietest in the industry, making it ideal for family rooms and other medium to large sized rooms. (Product is not suitable for window installation). EXCLUSIVE 1-2-5 : Your Emerson Quiet Kool Wi-fi enabled air conditioner comes with an industry-exclusive 1-2-5 that covers 1 year of labor, 2 years of parts, and 5 years on the compressor. Buy and use with confidence.. LCDI NEMA 6-20P PLUG: 4. 8 ft power cord with special LCDI NEMA 6-20P plug requires 230 volt/20 amp outlet, and is unable to be plugged into a standard 115V electrical outlet.Application area Cooling EPA (sp. ft):550. SPLIT AIR EXHAUST VENTS: Two air exhaust vents (instead of one) combine with three fan speeds to give you 8-way flexibility to direct the flow of air where you want it when you want it..

Intelligent sleep mode goes one step further by slowly adjusting the temperature and fan speed to keep you comfortable overnight while saving you energy and money.. SMART-FIT SIZING: With dimensions of 20. 3� D x 24. 2� W x 14. 5� H, this Emerson Quiet Kool through the wall air conditioner was designed with Smart-Fit dimensions, meaning it will fit any 24. 5� to 27� wall sleeve you have. Included foam insulation with help you retro-fit your sleeve to this new design. Don�t have a sleeve? Remember to check the dimensions prior to purchasing.Fits into the old LG A/C sleeve. Quiet but also provides nice white noise.So far my only issue is that the morning, sunlight comes right through part of the inner A/C grill, even though my husband completely sealed the outer perimeter with black caulk. Thus, all that we spent on blackout window coverings is partly going to waste. I will call Emerson about this to see if they have heard about this and have a solution.UPDATE: March 2020: Starting to turn itself off whether it�s on Fan or Cool. Made sure the TIMER wasn�t engaged. No strange noises or smells or malfunctioning � it just STOPS � THEN IT RESTARTS ON ITS OWN...The remote control for this unit is great. It even has a button to turn off the display on the unit. That�s a great feature for a bedroom if you prefer to sleep in total darkness.The noise level on this unit is pretty low compared to the power it puts out. If you have a problem with noise there is most likely an issue with the way it was mounted. Mine has plenty of insulation between the unit and the wall sleeve on all sides and that keeps the metals from clanging together.It�s not really the easiest unit to install just because there are a lot of things to consider and if you don�t install these professionally you may spend hours just researching which wall sleeve works best with this unit. You also need to be sure the sleeve and the unit slope down toward the outside of the building. I initially installed the sleeve level with the unit tilted back, but because the sleeve was level all the water was standing in the bottom of the sleeve and eventually seeping out the front. I had to pull it all out and redo everything with the sleeve tilted back at an angle that would allow it to drain.Once it�s properly installed this has made my largest room my most comfortable room. It keeps the room around 70 all day in August without having to work too hard. That�s the main reason I bought it. Because it performs its main task so well and because the remote is so good I would give this five stars overall.I replaced the old unit from an apartment after it stopped working. The build and design of this unit is great. The remote control features are a nice bonus in addition to the what appears to be a built in surge protector on the end of the power cord. After several months of usage, no complains.installed this today. Was smooth and easy after reading the instructions. I am VERY HAPPY. It blows hard, gets very cold. My bedroom is in the afternoon sun and gets really hot. This unit got the room cold. So cold I was able to open the door and cool down the adjoining room with a ceiling fan by 10 to 15 degrees with a small fan in the door. I bought this because of the low price, and have had issues with to much ""Fancy"" in electronic controls. I am very happy I got it so far.This was a replacement for a 20+ year old inefficient through the wall AC unit. We decided to upgrade to an AC unit with heat as that large room was often chilly. I am totally satisfied with the cooling and supplemental heating abilities of this unit. Very heavy so it was a 2-person install but the associated sleeve made the installation easy and looks professional. Very happy with the purchase!Pro's:","Pro's:

So this monitor has very few reviews but I decided to pull the trigger. I have only had the monitor for a few days but So far so good. There is another 27inch monitor from sceptre that appears to be basically the same monitor just slightly larger screen size. There are several reviews on that product if you are curious.Monitor came nicely packaged. As others have stated it does need a little messing around with the setting to get the picture just right. I found that the gamma needed to be turned up on mine by one click think I have 2.4. I would like to be able to turn the brightness down some but on my black level test the setting of level 50 is the lowest you can go and still view all the black levels. So you do get a slightly washed out appearance with some images but it gets better if you turn the brightness down and sacarfice the black level.I play league of legends and on my gaming laptop with nvidia 1050 via hdmi to hdmi I was able to achieve near the 144 fps. I did have to lower my in game settings to get it but that must be because my gpu has reached its limits. I wanted to share this because there are many 144hz monitors in this price range but majority only support 144hz via display port. My laptop only had hdmi and usb 3.0 like many consumer grade laptops and desktops. You can buy a converter but that causes you to use up a usb 3.0 port as well as your hdmi port.I am not an expert by any means but the build quality seems pretty decent. I am not sure what type of lcd pannel is used. On the other 27inch sceptre stated it is a VA for this one I cannot find any info. Either wait it doesn�t really matter because if your buying this it is for gaming so you are sacarficing viewing angle and color accuracy for reduced input lag and faster refresh rates.I think it is definitely worth the buy at under $200 as long as it stands the test of time.This review is my own personal opinion. I paid for this product with my own hard earned money.Ok the TV is not a true 144hz tv. It only supports 120hz on my xbox 1x and on my high end gaming pc. Not that the human eye can tell the difference but stop advertizing this at 144, it's 120! It does have good picture. Just fix the description to 120hz*new review 3/16/19* After building a new Ryzen machine, it seems the flickering is gone. I have no idea what the cause was. I have a feeling it was something to do with my older z77 build. Everything is butter smooth on my new build, no more flickering lines when scrolling through webpages and no more display port flickering. 5 Stars from me.Wife purchased for me for Christmas. Let me tell you something. I have never used Freesync. I have never used 144hz. I played for 2 hours on CS:GO before I realized Freesync was not enabled, and had to be enabled in the monitor settings. Once I enabled Freesync on the monitor, Radeon drivers immediately detected Freesync, the screen flashed, and before my eyes OH MY SDLKFHSDF. Freesync is amazing as long as you are in the 48hz - 144hz range. Seriously. I came from a 23"" TN panel aaaaaaaand the colors blows it away. This VA panel has viewing angles and colors that rival my ASUS IPS panel in my daughters room.I did try lowering the bottom end of the Freesync range with CRU. I did successfully get to 40hz on the desktop, and for about 20 minutes in game. Then my Radeon driver crashed, so it's probably safe to say I could get 42hz out of it without issue, but I just put it back.I do have a gripe though. I am on DP, and I am noticing a slight flicker as I scroll through webpages on rows of text. It's like a solid line slashes through the middle of text. Now this could be ghosting or something to do with the refresh rate and I am going to knock a star off. But, for the money, this monitor is mint. I will be ordering a second as well.This is a gorgeous 144hz monitor which is $50+ cheaper than anything you'll find elsewhere. The curved display takes some getting used to at first but now the screen looks completely natural to me. The speakers on the monitor are decently loud and are actually louder than the speakers on my last monitor. 144hz is buttery smooth and you can notice the difference just by moving the cursor across the screen. One thing of note is that when I first hooked the monitor all up the refresh rate was still at 60hz and I had to manually go into advanced display settings in Windows and set it to 144hz, so if you get this monitor and don't notice a difference right away check that it's actually set to the highest it can be.Pro's:","Pro's:

Frames Larger than 8x10 come with UV Filtering .040 US Made Plexiglass.. Black 1 Inch Flat, Wood Composite MDF Wall Decor Picture & Poster Frame. Frame includes: 0.040 Acrylic, Cardboard Backer and Hanger installed on both sides. It can hang either way. On return 20% restocking charges will be applied.The frame is great! Except, the acrylic face is obvious and a little distracting. That part looks cheap. The rest of the frame looks fine.UPDATE: I failed to remove the protector sheet on the other side of the acrylic screen. Once removed, it is visually not distinguishable to me from glass.I needed some inexpensive frames for some of my son's artwork and came across these on Amazon. Although they are not solid wood they look very nice and the size was exact. They are very light weight so I'll be able to use 3M hangers and not damage my wall, even though they do come with picture hanging hardware. I am very happy with my purchase for the quality and price, so I'll be ordering a few more.We ordered this frame for a numbered piece of art we purchased at a gallery along with another size for another numbered piece of art. We didn�t want a huge frame with a mat surround. I wanted a classic black frame that would fit around this art without spending a fortune as it is difficult to hang the art in a multi stairwell. This was the only frame I could find that had the correct size and weight I needed. The price is marked up and the quality doesn�t match the price, however it works for what I wanted.The frame itself came in quality packaging and was super easy to place art into and the plastic coating on the plexiglass was well thought out. I simply unpacked the frame, layer it out on our dining table onto a beach towel. I picked up the plexiglass and removed the visual side of the plastic coating and placed it into its frame again without putting finger prints on it. Then I gently picked the corner leaving it in the frame and pulled it back with my other hand on the bottom part of the plastic coating and never made contact with my fingers to keep it clean. I place my artwork face down and made sure the hook on the back and the artwork was in the correct position. I put the cardboard backing on and closed all the little pegs. Hung and I love it!The frame quality is fine and the price was reasonable, but it's not 16x28. When I tried to put my poster that *is* 16x28 (measured at least twice to be sure before purchasing) in it, it was too large. I measured the cardboard backing and it's off by half an inch in both length and width, which meant I had to trim the edges of the poster.I am keeping the frame because my clumsy trimming is not noticeable at all once in the frame and it does look nice on the wall, but I am disappointed by the inaccurate dimensions, especially when this is not a standard size.Before I ordered my frame, I read the reviews to see what people were saying about this frame. some were good and some were not. But I wanted that frame but I didn't want the problems that the the reviews that were not good to happen to me. In good faith, I ordered the frame and they contacted to me about security for my package for the delivery. I was actually impressed. I told them among other things, that I needed them to secure the delivery by way of making sure they packaged this frame so that it would not be damaged. They responded ""sure we will."" I wasn't feeling that answer but I decided to let it go and trust that their word would be true. A week later I received my frame and I was ecstatic to see that it was in pristine condition.As careful as I was I scratched it thankfully the picture in it hides it so. over all I am thrilled because it looks beautiful. Nicely done. thank you!Pro's:","Pro's:

No TOOLS REQUIRED AND NO NEED TO HANDLE TANGLED WIRES. This 14x17 Will fit a Picture/Photo of 14x17 , this is also called the glass size, a negligible portion is not visible, and is covered by the frame Lip.. Frame includes: 0.040 Acrylic, Cardboard Backer and Hanger installed on both sides. It can hang either way. On return 20% restocking charges will be applied.. Smooth Wrap Finish, .75-Inch Wide, Traditional Black, Solid Popler Wood Picture Frame. These Frames 8x10 & smaller come with Glass. Frames Larger than 8x10 come with UV Filtering .040 US Made Plexiglass.Inserted a poster (paper thin) into frame and hung up up in portrait orientation using the hooks that were already installed by manufacturer. Looked nice for serval weeks then notice the top edge of the Plexiglas sheet started to bulge out from under the frame on the top. Then realized the top horizonal frame piece pulls upward from the frame due to weight of the wooden frame, thus allowing the plexiglass to bulge out. For the money I paid for this basic wooden frame I expect more sturdiness. If hanging the frame in portrait orientation, install loops on either side of the frame and use a wire. The weight of the frame pulling down from the hook on the top will cause the top of the frame to warp.The quality was not what I was expecting for the price. I had to buy it because of the odd size of my print. The packaging it was delivered in was horrible. One corner of the frame was exposed. I had to return because the plexiglas was badly cracked on one side. If it has been packaged better, probably would have survived shipment.I purchased this frame mostly because if the odd size I needed: 15x25 for a special instructional poster.The fact that they said solid wood, in fact solid Poplar (one of the softer hard woods, but a hard wood nonetheless), was the clincher.HOWEVER, the color of the frame is a veneer, kinda plasticy like what is put on MDF (faux wood) type frames. There was however what appeared to be a 1/8 square dowel, raw untreated, that one would suspect as evidence of all wood. But this was clearly ""attached"", I assume mostly to keep the metal tabs used to keep the picture back in place from falling out of the ""all wood frame"".THIS FRAME ISN'T WORTH 1/2 WHAT I PAID!It was shipped from the seller (not Amazon) and would be a pain to return (return shipping at my cost) and not worth the hassle.I got a frame that looks decent for the size I needed. My satisfaction ends there. I WON'T ORDER FROM THESE FOLKS AGAIN!I have ordered from a different seller for custom frames in past (Craig Frames) and been very satisfied. I picked these guys based on price. And, to my disappointment, I got less than what I paid for.The frame looks ok on the wall. The packaging was fine and it arrived on time. I would agree with other reviewers that the frame is overpriced for what you get. It is flimsy and cheaply made. It would also have been helpful if it included some additional hanging hardware. Given I�m precluded from putting nails in my walls, hanging horizontally with command strips and wire would be tough given the hooks that were on the back of the frame. Fortunately I had another broken frame where the back with the necessary hardware was intact and fit.I probably wouldn�t buy this frame again.I came across this frame on Amazon after being discouraged by the prices I was given at my local Michael's store. This kit comes with exactly what you will need and no more. I found that the plastic sheet that covers the art was very clear and transparent once the protective film is removed from both sides. It did not distort the looks of my art. The frame comes well packaged and it is highly unlikely the frame will be damaged based on how well they are packaged. You need no special skills and no tools to assembly the frame. I ended up using my hands for everything and that worked just fine. The frame is light weight and both portrait and landscape mounts are included. There is no hanging wire included in the 20x28 kit and you should not need it. The mounts are pre-installed and they are the type that are intended to hang on a nail. There are 5 v-shaped notches on each mount that give you some flexibility with the placement of the nail. The frame is light weight and a single nail works just fine. I ordered the Cherry color and liked the overall appearance. It really looked great once I got my art in the frame and it was hung on the wall. I would definitely recommend it for someone trying to save some money and do it yourself.Pro's:","Pro's:

I do not like the berry flavored powder, but I love the chocolate powder, coconut pre-mixed drink box and the chocolate peanut butter bars.

I had an issue with one of the deliveries, and they refunded my money and allowed me to keep the extra order. I highly recommend this company and their products.I absolutely love the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Aloha bars. I really dislike bars with soy, these bars have no soy. There isn�t a heavy peanut butter flavor and there is just the right amount of chocolate chips. It pairs perfectly with chai tea topped with coconut/almond creamer. I keep one of these bars in my purse and work bag as an emergency snack.I habitually purchase the cookie dough flavor Aloha bars, and purchased the variety pack to try other flavors. The cookie dough flavor bar in the variety pack is VERY different than than the norm in color, appearance and taste. I�m concerned that I�ve purchased one of those made in China dupes that appear on amazon and will be tossing these out.These are absolutely delicious. They are super rich chocolatey, and don't have that weird protein powder taste that most protein bars do. I also love that these only have 4g sugar! I have already gotten multiple people I know hooked on these just by letting them try a bite because they are so tasty you'd think it was a candy bar, haha. Just make sure you don't accidentally buy the ones from the old recipe (the 14g sugar ones) those are NOT delicious like these. Enjoy!!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: IronWolf internal hard drives are the ideal solution for up to 24 bay, multi user NAS server environments that demand powerhouse performance. Store more and work faster with a NAS hard drive that provides ultra high capacity 10TB and speeds up to 214MB/s. Specifically built for less wear and tear, little to no noise/vibration, no lags or down time, increased file sharing performance, lower power consumption, and extra data protection even in the event of power loss. Easily monitor NAS drive health using the integrated IronWolf Health Management system, and enjoy long term reliability with 1.2M hours MTBF. Five year limited warranty and two year Rescue Data Recovery Services includedI purchased 4 IronWolf Pro 10TB Drives for my Synology NAS, everything went smoothly with the setup. One year later one drive began to have Bad Sectors, at first 2, then 6, then 8, then 20 and by the time it was 34 bad sectors I decided it was time to contact Seagate and execute my 5-year warranty coverage for this pro-level drive.The return RMA process was as simple as logging into Seagate website and submit the drive SN for return, a few minutes later I got a confirmation email with shipping instructions.The replacement took about 2 weeks to arrive (shipping) due to East Coast to West Coast, but Seagate processed the return the second day of arrival on their end.Long story short - if you buy a Seagate drive, they stand behind their warranty.Factory configuration is for Power-up in standby (PUIS) which is incompatible with my Synology DS916+. To use with Synology; you have to find the right utility on Seagates' web site... boot the drive in a computer... and the run a commandline utility to turn off PUIS. Doing that will disable this feature and allow you to use the drive in your NAS.I wanted a reliable and quiet drive for my Synology 4 bay NAS. I've had great luck with Seagate products and I purchased the IronWolf Pro because they have better reliability for a small increase in price. I've had customer service questions of Seagate and I found them to be very responsive. I bought multiple 10TB drives now and after 2 years - no problems.I use these hard disk drives in my home QNAP NAS to hold all of my media (Music, Recorded TV, Movies, Photos, Home Videos). The NAS is in the basement, so I do not hear what little noise they make. They work great and I don't have any latency issues when streaming uncompressed over-the-air HD Recorded TV. I will be purchasing them again when I undoubtedly expand my storage.I bought a few of these for my new Synology NAS, I've gotta say these are BEEFY! So far, no problems here whatsoever. They all worked right out of the box as expected and are quite fast, though I don't have exact specs. I will say I did a lot of research beforehand and my brother in law (who is very competent in the ways of IT tech) had nothing but good things to say about these. I'm glad I listened to his advice!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Mesh. Imported. The 2020 Kelty Wireless features a freestanding design and two-vestibule construction which means sweet storage space for all your gear. The tent measures 86 x 49 in (LXW) and has a peak height of 43 in. Floor space is 29 square feet.. The tent has 2 doors. The 3 poles are made fiberglass/hybrid and the walls are made of 68D poly, 1800mm/40D no-see-um mesh. The 3 included poles are made of fiberglass/hybrid and the tent features Kelty Quick Corners for lightnin'-fast setup. The brand new EZ-Zip vestibule makes getting in and out. . . well. . . easyWe bought this tent for car camping with two adults and an 18 month old kid and a 30 lb dog. It fit the bill perfectly. We had space for the two of us to sleep, a pack-and-play crib, a folding rocking chair, dog bed and spare room for clothes/stuff/etc. We compared this to two other 6 person tents, each nearly twice as expensive, and even ignoring price, this tent was a pretty clear winner.Things that are great:Easy to set up. This tent has three poles and very simple construction. The sleeves that hold the poles at the corners are also a great innovation that make it a lot easier to set up with one person (the other tents were still using grommets that the poles tended to pop out of). If you're shorter, it may be a little tougher to set up the final pole across the top of the tent with a single person, but if you're bringing a six person tent, you've hopefully got a friend to help out. With two people, we had the tent set up in just over five minutes on our first try.Good rain-fly coverage - This rain fly covers the entire tent. It keeps it a little warmer (which may be a good thing depending on the time of year), but I think it's worth it to have the full coverage. The rainfly only has tie downs in the corners and the vestibules. I'd like to see a loop in the middle of tent to keep it a little more taught, but it didn't seem like a big issue.Doors & Vestibules - You get two doors and vestibules, with a good amount of covered space for gear. Doors and vestibules have nice tiebacks to open things up to a breeze if it's hot and you're not worried about bugs.What's not so good:Interior Pockets - Inside the tent has 4 pockets (plus the two light-diffusing head-lamp pockets). It's a weird number for a 6 person tent. They're also pretty small compared to some other tents.Weight - The poles are heavy. Hopefully you're not backpacking this tent. The silver lining is that the count of poles is lower than most other tents of this size.Duffel is hard to zip, it was tough to put most tents of this size back in their packs, but this duffel seemed the hardest to re-pack.Faulty Shock Cord - The shock cord in the third pole (the short one) snapped on our third time disassembling the tent. Checking it, there's another section of the same cord that looks like it's barely held together that I'm surprised didn't fail too. Customer service for this issue is not so hot; they want you to mail in the pole and wait 4-6 weeks for them to ship a new one. Or Amazon will replace the whole tent. Luckily, shock cord is not essential to the function of the tent (and honestly not really needed on the short pole). It's also pretty cheap and easy to fix yourself. But if all the cord looks like this, I'm not too confident the cord in the other poles won't break soon too.Overall, I'd say this is one of the best six person tents available and for the price, it is the best six person tent available. If it weren't for the shock cord issue, it would easily be a five star tent.Great tent, as advertised. Could use tie off tabs on tarp edges that are not on vestibule sides. Tarp lies on tent body restricting air flow. Added tarp clamps to address this issue.Bought a Kelty due to brand loyalty, to replace the last one, which I bought in 1977!The four person model is large and spacious due to the spreader bar at the top.Easy to set up for one person.Tent is heavy,so not for backpacking. I live Beautiful BC but used the US Amazon since it was much cheaper after duties and exchange than the Canadian Amazon.Tent floor seems thin so I will likely get a footprint for it.My boyfriend and I recently decided to get into camping and bought this as our first tent. Was super easy to set up and take down. The tent was sturdy throughout the night and the blue material makes for a pretty color inside when you wake up in the morning.This is my first tent and I love every aspect of it.

Text: Built for 24/7 surveillance. AllFrame technology for better performance. Designed to support up to 64 HD cameras. Engineered for compatibility. 3-year manufacturer's limitedWD makes a great product but beware of getting this from ""We Love TEC""It arrived with an open package like it was previously installed and zero packing or support. Simply flopping all over the place during transit.Hard drives are a very fragile thing. Utterly ridiculous!!EASY - VERY EASY TO INSTALL!!!Before handling the hard drive, before you take it out of its package - you MUST DISCHARGE ANY STATIC ELECTRICITY FROM YOURSELF, YOUR WORK AREA, AND ITEMS TO BE USED!The best way to do that is to purchase a ground strap for your wrist. There's a velcro strap that you strap around your wrist and it's connected to a spiral cable which extends to a alligator clip. The alligator clip you can attach to a piece of metal or something going to the ground and that'll discharge any static electricity from your body. They also make anti-static mat that you can work on. Some people take anti static fabric sheets and rub them on themselves or they rub their hands on metal to make sure they discharged the static electricity from their body. Just don't purposely Shuffle on carpeting or known areas of static electricity build up cuz this can damage your equipment!So I opened up my Envy our case, after unplugging all the power cables and video cables. From there there are four bolts on the bottom holding the existing hard drive to the bottom of the case. Once I remove those, the hard drive slid straight out from its connector. The new hard drive the Western Digital purple 6Tb plugged in very nicely! I reinserted the four screws underneath and put the top of the case back on, plugged everything in formatted the hard drive and it's been working beautifully!I'm using this to increase the capacity of my Swann 8580 series NVR surveillance system. It won't allow anything larger than 6 terabytes and it came with a 2 terabyte hard drive.Instead of transferring files from the m v r to an SD card or a Micro SD card then to an external hard drive or computer, I just decided to go with a larger hard drive and when it's full have another one ready to replace it and store them safely then I can always have the original. And then I'm able to put that back in the NVR and use all the features of the NVR to examine the video, which you lose when you download the videos and transfer them. And it takes a very long time to transfer 122 terabytes of information from the NVR to a micro SD card or an SD card then uploading to an external hard drive or computer. And that way you also have a recording of everything the surveillance system captured in case you missed a recording and now you no longer have it. And then it gives me time to review recordings and then I'm able to reuse the hard drive after formatting it.I have purchased a lot of these WD purple hard drives over the years to record video from our cameras. Up until recently I have always had good luck with these and they have been solid, however in the past few months, I have had three failures on drives that were less than a year old. WD did replace them, so I am happy about that, but I am a little concerned that the quality has gone down. I hope it was a fluke�Update - another failure. Tried to open a support case with WD about this and it has been over a week with no reply. Changing my rating to two stars.It is a surveillance drive for NVR applications. I am assuming that anyone who knows the difference will understand this & the different build construction of different drives.It is quiet, no obvious noise, I have it running in an Amcrest brand NVR which it fit perfectly, screw holes lined up well, the cable connectors fit perfectly. I cannot measure the temperature during operation, but the NVR does not run hot or even warm, so that is a good sign to me.Longevity - It has not been running for very long, but the WD specs give an expected life (mean measured value, I assume) so I expect it to meet the mean life expectancy. Anything past that is a bonus.Use it for surveillance & it is fine, these are typically important pieces of stored data, but not normally mission critical, if they are, they you are probably an IT expert & you know what to do to back them up anyway (I am NOT an expert, I just have enough knowledge to be dangerous :-)....)Overall I have had good luck with different WD drives over the years & I expect no less from this oneI did not get paid, reimbursed, of given anything for free (never do as I am not important enough online!) so you are getting my own unbiased, honest opinion & nothing but that. :-)These are great HDs. I�ve purchased 4tb few years back when I replaced my camera system and I�m glad I did. I would strongly recommend purchasing these purple surveillance hard drives rather than buying included with DVR, those are typically cheap and don�t last long not to mention you get larger capacity for less $ with this option. It�s matter of plugging in two cables and installing screws at bottom of DVR to hold hard drive�you don�t have to be tech to do it. My friend needed HD replacement as DVR suddenly started beeping�my immediate reaction was to look for purple HD. I�ve used different well known brands in past but this is my favorite�definitely recommendPro's:","Pro's:

One year after-sale protection for frame, six months after-sale protection for fabrics and accessories.Hey y'all, this canopy should be called a pop up room! This is one of the easiest canopies I've ever set up. Even the $99 ones from the local stores take two people to set up and is shaky, this one is not the case! I seriously just stood under the middle and pushed the center up and the legs GLIDED out SMOOTHLY! What!?!? This canopy/booth/room is hands down one of the best! Absolutely worth the money and is extremely study.The sand bags were a excellent addition and easy to use also. I had the other Vendors complimenting my booth and how sturdy and easy it was to set up. They all asked if I had help to set up and fortunately didn't need any. The top and sides are very durable yet not heavy so it makes it easy to set up. Our first night up it poured down rain and there weren't any leaks however if you have anything up against the sides the water will pull through getting things wet, so I recommend pulling things inward during downtime.**BONUS** Added tip for all my fellow DIYers if you get the ""active wear heat transfer vinyl"" you can iron on your own website or graphics like I did on mine as pictured. It went on very easy with no pulling or peeling, it definitely made a difference at the show. Good luck and please drop a like if this was helpful. Thank you!UPDATE (July 25, 2017): So, this weekend, we setup at a festival to vend coffee. The issue we were having with the canopy resolved itself when the mechanism that was stuck released and snapped into place. We also experienced about 3 inches of rain in a little more than an hour with high wind gusts up to 20mph at 3am. I've been camping for many years and never had the ""pleasure"" of being nailed by this much rain and wind, it was impressive to say the least. We have expensive equipment that is kept under the canopy and we felt completely secure that the canopy would be fine. When we assessed the situation at sunrise, other vendor setups and canopies were completely destroyed, while our ABC Canopy was perfect. I would recommend this canopy to everyone.We bought this canopy about a month ago for immediate use for festival vending. Out of the box, one of the legs' push-buttons is jammed in (replacement part K, according to the company site), so it's impossible to lock the legs. Since we needed it for 3 days and had no other options, we were able to stick a peg into the hole to secure the leg position. We're not even sure how it would be possible to fix or replace this part, as it would require taking the entire thing apart, and frankly, I shouldn't have to do that. Shipping it back is not an option for us, either, since we've consistently needed to use it for back-to-back events (the next event is in 2 weeks).Regarding the awning, we cannot figure it out and it's totally useless, sagging and drooping... if it were to rain, the water will pool, filling the awning, adding unnecessary weight and possibly falling on the heads of our customers, or destroying our product. We thought there must be some other parts we are missing, but aren't sure since there are no instructions for the awning.As for the overall quality, we are fully impressed. It's heavyweight, looks great, and has handled some pretty tough wind and rain. While it can be cumbersome to zip the sides, once in place, we feel the canopy and the construction of the material are extremely secure. We have electric equipment that needs to be kept dry and this canopy didn't leak at all, despite two days of heavy rains. If the one leg lock wasn't defective, I would give it 5 stars, even despite the wonky awning. Frame construction has a great feel. The canopy material, itself, is easy to wipe clean. The carrying bag is nice with handles that are well-placed.The ABC canopy is a really great product. The best thing about it is that it is extremely strong and sturdy. The worst thing about it is that it is a little heavy. My wife and I set it up with no problem, but I would say it takes two people. We are seasoned festival goers and have watched two Coleman Max canopies disintegrate from wind flex. The support parts break on the cross bars and once that happens the only thing the Coleman Max is good for is recycling. So, I decided to go big on the next canopy, that is why I choose the ABC canopy.The reason it is heavier is because there is much more metal to the structure. The ABC canopy does not flex like the Coleman did, it is built more like a vendor canopy. The top goes on easy, it is a strong material with Velcro attachment points and straps. I did not use the weight bags, so I cannot give an opinion about them, I use heavy tent spikes.Overall I am very happy with my purchase, and I would certainly recommend this product.Quality! That is my first impression after using the tent 4 times thus far. Comparing it side by side with a very popular competitor, there is no comparison. The ABC canopy is much nicer, other reviews say they didn't get instruction, i had everything in the box. The yellow attracts a lot of attention and other vendors at the flea market have asked where i got the tent and what brand is it? After checking it out they have been very impressed with the construction. It isn't light, so two people is best to set it up, however it only takes about 5 minutes to set it up so it is very easy to do.The front awning is awesome, and it adds another layer of comfort for my customers. The side and back walls are very easy to put on, I will have to say the Velcro used could be a little stronger or wider, but that is really knit picky to say the least. I spent two days reading all the reviews of the ABC and Eurmax canopies and finally settled on the ABC. Have to say i'm as happy as can be so far.ABC Canopy is a very high quality product. I can set it up by myself easily enough, of course an extra hand would make it much easier. I was able to fold down the sides during my event, and then put them up at night for security. All materials used and the craftsmanship are excellent and if you are selling an amazing product, you want to showcase it with quality that will last! Several vendors at my event, had ABC Canopies and even the older ones were in great shape! Vendors with lesser quality enclosures, were struggling during set up, having malfunctions during the 2 day event and detracting from their products.Pro's:","Pro's:

Please check your user manual or the original bulbs size to verify the compatible before purchasing. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact usI was looking for an LED upgrade from the OME halogen blubs. The Auxbeam Extremely Bright LED's were the answer for my 2017 Kia Sportage. As much as I enjoy my vehicle there is in my opinion, a design flaw, the turn single and backup light housings are in the rear bumper. This location has a greater impact on the turn signals. The backups were (for me) dim. that tis no longer an issue. Auxbeam LED's in this function are great. The rear area is lit as if there were external separate light housings installed. Definite recommended. No additional resister required for this application.Have bought 2 pairs of these Auxbeam 1156 LED replacement bulbs.I highly recommend them.Using one pair for vehicle backup lights, they are a whole lot brighter and create a lot more visibility when backing up.Have been installed for close to a year.The second pair went into a yard style riding mower, tremendous improvement in visibility for night time mowing.This pair has been installed a couple months.Absolutely no issues with these.I highly recommend them.Bright, clear taillights, even in bright sunlight. Just what my 1972 Mustang needed.I ordered these led bulbs because my car only has one reverse light. The single halogen bulb just wasn't good enough to light up what was behind me, so I decided to upgrade it to an led bulb. The single led bulb is a major improvement compared to the single halogen. I'm sure other cars with two bulbs would be even better off, but since my car only has one I'll just keep the other bulb as a backup. I definitely recommend these bulbs.Very good and super bright. I will reccomend to buy. Worth your money! Very clear to drive in darkPro's:","Pro's:

Exclusive proprietary packaging ensures safe delivery of fragile glass items; order with confidence and satisfaction - add to your cart today!Was back and forth between this one and a similar sized on from a Michael's but after reading a few negative reviews on the Michael's one, I went with this and so glad I did. It was very well packaged (double-boxed) and there was no damage to frame at all. Frame was very sturdy, looked great, was easy to remove backboard and add picture and close back up again. It does have the double hanging tags on the backboard (not on the frame) which make it a challenge to hang if you use them (I did, just took some extra care while measuring to make sure I had the nail in the right spot), but for the price I don't think you can beat it. If I had more this size, I'd buy this again in a second.Absolutely worth the $50. It�s well-made and beautiful. You could get a cheaper one, but it would look cheap- this one doesn�t. Sometimes with cheap frames, where the corners meet can look sloppy and not matched up properly, but this one is perfect. Arrived in perfect condition. It looks great on our wall! I used it for a black and white wedding photo and I�m really pleased with it.The packaging is amazing. Never seen a frame packaged like that with styrofoam. Good quality. The matte is an ivory color so it�s not white or anything. Looks nice though.This is about 5x more than I would pay for a cheap plastic frame a department store, but it's heavier, sturdier, and has real glass. When you give someone a poster as a gift, you need to get them a nice frame to put it in. At $40.99, this Art Emotion frame is the perfect combination of quality (compared to department store junk) and value (compared to custom frames).This frame arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition. There wasn't a scratch or ding to be found on it! I removed the glass and laid an old canvas oil painting in the frame and it fit very well. The backing board has multiple lock tabs on each side of the frame, so the painting fit very flat and secure.Absolutely a great buy for framing canvas paintings. Would definitely recommend!Pro's:","Pro's:

When i contacted the company they said they wouldn't back up their product outside of 90 days. All the cheap Everlast gloves I've ever used have out lasted these gloves by a considerable amount of time. Save your money. This glove is worthless.Lo primero que tiene que saber es que el color no se parece en nada a las im�genes de la publicidad como se puede ver en la primera fotograf�a. En segundo lugar, los guantes son m�s ligeros que el peso indicado, en mi caso compr� de 12 oz, pero al pesarlos en la b�scula resultaron ser de 10 oz. Tercero, los guantes se sienten muy fr�giles como si no estuvieran hechos para durar. No obstante, tengo que decir que solo se trata de la primera impresi�n. Una vez aclarado todo esto y despu�s de 3 meses de uso tengo que decir que son los mejores guantes que he probado. Son muy c�modos y las molduras hacen que se ajusten perfectamente a las manos, lo cual ayuda a reducir las peque�as lesiones que se presentan en los entrenamientos. El amarre de la mu�eca es lo mejor que he probado, se siente muy seguro y tambi�n ayuda a evitar lesiones, adem�s de que el velcro doble de la correa es de la mejor calidad. Al principio ten�a dudas sobre la calidad de la piel, pero hasta ahora ha resultado muy buena. El color se ha oscurecido con los entrenamientos, especialmente en la parte que hacen contacto con el costal y en las partes donde les cae sudor por lo que ahora el tono es m�s parecido al de la publicidad como se ve en las fotos 2 y 3. He tenido guantes Cleto Reyes y de otras marcas locales de M�xico que tambi�n son muy buenas, pero definitivamente estos son los mejores. Son caros, pero lo valen. Espero, actualizar esta descripci�n cuando cumplan un a�o.Beautiful, great-functioning gloves! These are the top of the market based on quality, comfort, fit and finish... All my tools are Hayabusa, you can't do better. The only small thing is I bought large and they were just a bit loose on the hands so I bought the Hayabusa gel hand wraps. I've never wrapped before but these are easy and comfortable to use and closed the small gap inside these gloves. They fit amazingly well now with that small adjustment. If you don't mind the healthy price, these are worth the investment!Just starting boxing about 2 months ago and needed shoes and gloves. I looked at several brands and was frankly overwhelmed. After hours on boxing websites and Amazon reviews I went with the Hyabusa gloves and shoes. The gloves fit perfectly. I didn't realize that there is a second stabilizing velcro strap under the main velcro closure, genious. I can tighten the inner one and then the outer and my wrist has been completely stabilized. Although this may a positive or negative, when you hit the heavy bag you get just a little bit of bite on the bag instead of your glove just glancing off of the bag like some really cheap polyurethane gloves do. I really like this because now I actually have a much better idea of where my punches are landing and with what force. My next gloves will be the top tier of Hyabusa gloves.I read reviews and said that sound was not great when hitting bag and that they do not look like leather. I like the sound and the leather is awesome. The old fashion look is unique and everyone in the gym loves these gloves. When we were admiring these pair of gloves, we almost forgot that we are in a global pandemic. worth every single dollar paid for these gloves.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanI bought these gloves in 2016 and now it�s 2020 and I�m still using the same pair. They�re durable if you take care of them. I don�t clean them after every use and they haven�t cracked or anything yet- they still look really new. I also sweat a lot in these gloves and they don�t really hold any smells. I leave them airing out after each use and I�ve never had them smell the next day. The quality is really nice for beginners and even beyond. Most of the time, I wrap my hands, but even the times I�ve worked out without wraps it hasn�t bothered my knuckles or anything.I ordered the 24 oz gloves to use for training because even with wraps and leather bag gloves I was getting bruises on my knuckles, and with an old pair of 16 I was still getting bruises, much less though, so I ordered these for the weight and for the padding. It arrived early and I�ve had them for months with basically no damage to them. I use them twice a week and clean them after use. I�ve stopped getting bruises and actually have better technique because I kept preventing myself from looping my punches due to the weight. I honestly think my punches have become slightly harder, but my muscle endurance has gone up a bunch. These gloves last and will help in training for a long time if taken care of.I just wanted an EXTRA pair of gloves to have. I have a really good pair I prefer to wear to my boxing classes, but sometimes I want to leave those at home since they're bigger and tougher to put in my backpack. I also wear those so much that I want to air them out every 2-3 sessions so they don't get stinky. So I bought this pair since they're light, smaller than my other gloves. They're really well ventilated so I haven't had an issue with smell or sweat. I wouldn't recommend these if you're gunna hardcore beat up a bag, because they're not really cushioned as well as other gloves. I also thought that the velcro straps were too long, so putting these on/taking them off, is tough unless you have someone to help you.If you are needing a larger glove these are great. The 24oz size is kind of XXL and work great for my large hands. They are comfortable and can be worn without hand wraps. I use them for heavy bag training only and have never used them in the ring with another person. Their best use case is probably the heavy or speed bag.We bought several of these for our gym for our group boxing classes. They are used by multiple people of various abilities, and they are going on 3 years old now. I'm impressed with how well they've held up! They naturally have become smelly after repeated use in a hot, humid climate, but have withstood daily spraydowns of disinfectant and repeated use. Great value for a set of gloves!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Oxford Polyester. Imported. This is NOT a automatic pop up tent that need to be built by hand, suitable for customers who are good at hands-on ability, folding support rod, small package volume, easy to carry and storage for self-drive travel, BUT please install carefully according to the installation drawings and instrucitons, be sure to fix the stakes & wind ropes step by step, it will be more stable than automatic tent.Please DO NOT choose this tent if you want to build quickly in 60S.. Large space:Inside dimension14.1ft length*10ft width*6.58ft height, fit 4 full air mattresses(6.7ft*5ft/200cm*150cm),can accommodate 10~12 person,3 doors with mesh,3 Windows with mesh,divided into two rooms by separation curtain.. Materials: Waterproof Oxford Polyester, High density mesh.. Unique design: straight wall design, interior space is larger and more comfortable. If the door curtain supports by two poles, it becomes a sunshade canopy. The top of the tent is high density mesh, very breathable, we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sky when lying inside.. KTT Camping tent not only focus on the quality, but also pay attention to its practicality. We add 2 poles for the door curtain, it can immediately become an awning tent, family members can take a rest inside, also can play outside under the awning. Although it raises the cost, it brings you pleasure.LEAKS! LEAKS! LEAKS! And NOT a little! Try massive pools of water all over the floor. EVERY seam and zipper leaked. And this was after we used 6 cans of waterproofer on it before using it. The zipper fabric was shredding after 3 days and the zippers were all getting stuck and breaking! This tent was a TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!! And we thought it had that canopy at one entrance...it is NOT a canopy. Its the WINDOW cover!! SO it was really fun having to pull that down EVERY TIME it sprinkled. Someone mentioned in another review that the pockets (inside) leaked... THEY DO!! And all our air mattresses/ pillows and stuff were DRENCHED!!!! The only thing that saved us was the fact our sleeping bags were mostly waterproof. I do NOT recommend this tent. We are returning it...anything that leaks that much needs a WARNING label on it!While the fabric might be water resistant, the zippers are not which let's water slowly leak in. We got caught in a rain storm in the PNW and thought we were safe but upon waking we noticed water under our mattresses. Feeling around for holes we noticed droplets from the zipper area, super frustrating to deal with with 3 toddlers.Light weight and very manageable. Spacious room and glad we bought this for our family. Love this text.This tent is so cool and huge! My boyfriend and I used it for a camping trip over the summer and it was perfect. I'm used to staying in a camper so I wanted to feel like I was glamping a bit lol and this was perfect. There's plenty of room for a queen size mattress in each room with room to spare. We only used one mattress and the rest was used for hangout space. It's perfect if you have animals because they have room to walk around. Also, it was super easy to put up. Took us 30 minutes or less! It's worth the purchase! Highly suggest it!=]I am very happy with this tent! We purchased the tent a few months ago and have used it 3 times. You can lay in bed and stair up at the stars! It is the best tent I have purchased!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: As a brand, we tend to shake things up in our industry. The status quo of women�s boxing gloves typically includes bright pink or purple variations of gloves designed for men. We�re here to change that. Finally, a glove made for women. Sanabul Easter Egg boxing gloves feature a much narrower silhouette that contours around your hand for a snug and comfortable fit. Generally speaking, women tend to have smaller hands and unisex boxing gloves are often too bulky. Far from boring, our women�s boxing gloves have an eye-catching pastel color palette only found within our brand. The outer material features a sleek, yet sophisticated, design with a matte-finish, making these gloves truly one of a kind. You don�t have to settle for less. Just because we created a fashion forward boxing glove doesn�t mean we cut corners with functionality. These gloves feature the same high quality craftsmanship, performance and durability that has made us industry leaders. Need help deciding which gloves to get? The most common recommendation is the 12 oz size (equivalent to� medium�). Young ladies or kids (over 10 years of age) should go with 8 oz boxing gloves. If you plan on using your gloves for power shots or heavy-bag use, we suggest grabbing the 14 oz sizeI purchased these after using generic gloves for years (the ones you get with your membership at kickboxing gyms) and Everlast. I noticed that the instructor had these gloves, so I figured they must be legit. These seem bulkier than my Everlast, but then again those seemed strangely small. Also, I got the 14 oz for a better workout, whereas my previous pairs were 12, so that could be why, too. I can tell these are good quality and will hold up nicely. For reference, I use them for kickboxing workout classes, not actual boxing. *I will update on durability after a few months.* I like these enough to recommend the brand to my mom, who needed new gloves because her Everlast were falling apart, too. She ordered a different color and they are so cute, I�m jelly. I particularly like that these come in so many cute colors.I have only recently taken up kickboxing but I love it and decided to get a membership and wanted my own gloves. I have small but wide hands so I wanted a smaller glove but still with weight to it. I checked with my gym and the recommended 12oz for women (that's what I was using there). I have used these about 3x now and I definitely love them. Color is fantastic, love the mesh carry bag as well (also fit my wraps in there). I would order these again, only reason not 5 stars is bc I cannot speak to durability yet. If you have very long hands/fingers these may be snug for you.Love them! They are still holding great after 7 monthsLove these gloves! I bought them for the color but they are functional as well. I am a beginner boxer and do bag work . Perfect for my class .lots of compliments too!These gloves are perfect for someone with smaller hands. They come inside/with a carrying case. The only problem I had was how long it took to ship after I purchased them. I do recommend buying wraps to wear underneath. It will help with spacing in the gloves and protects your wrists. They have the perfect amount of padding for punching/ heavy bag work. I take MMA three days a week and they haven�t shown any wear and tear so far.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: LARGE SPACE GAZEBO: The fully assembled pergola measures 16' L X 12' W x 9.5' H and can cover 192 square feet. Spacious enough to accommodate 8 to 10 people for your party. This outdoor gazebo is perfect for an outdoor barbecue, soaking, meeting guests, or daily relaxation.. DOUBLE TOP DESIGN: For fuller protection and fresher air, our patio gazebo features a ventilated, double-layer polycarbonate roof. It prevents harmful UV rays while allowing air circulation and helps withstand strong wind.. STURDY ALUMINUM FRAME: Our gazebos for patios feature a rugged steel construction powder coat finish that won't scratch, peel, corrode, or rust. Comes with a pre-drilled base and is supplied with expansion screws for concrete floors. Designed for sturdy installation and helps maintain stability for years. Tip: If installing on wood floors, buyers need to purchase wood panel-specific expansion screws.. INCLUDE MESH CURTAINS & PRIVACY CURTAINS: The hardtop gazebo comes with a double-track system for easy sliding. Removable curtains ensure UV and rain protection, while the equipped mesh curtain with zipper keeps good ventilation. Let you enjoy great privacy while having full airflow and a wide view of the outdoors.. MULTI SCENARIO USE: Our backyard gazebo includes all necessary hardware and installation manuals and requires 2 to 3 people to complete the installation in approximately 5 hours. Use this garden gazebo to shade your garden, hot tub, or even an area for the kids to play. It can also be set up as an outdoor parlor, or even parking shed.This gazebo is really well made, heavy duty, and GORGEOUS! The panels of fabric are very heavy for outdoor use, and the roofing blocks the UV rays well, while still letting the light through. We added a ceiling fan and lights to the inside, which really made it complete. I will caution that if you're going to use a full size fan, you'll need a spacer, and you'll have to mount the fan to the inside with additional hardware. The U bracket might be good to hang a small light or fan, but not an installed ceiling fan. You'll need the spacer so it can hang low enough to it won't hit the ceiling panels. The only complaint is not the fault of the company in any way. We have discovered that earwigs love to hang out inside the small openings in the ceiling panels. Every now and then, we need to knock them out of there. I'm a bit concerned that the hangers for the side panels are made of plastic instead of metal, so I hope they hold up over time and don't become fragile and break. Time will tell. The total build completion time, with the additional ceiling fan, took us about 11 hours between 3 people working on it. Overall, a wonderful product, well worth every penny!I researched these quite extensively before making this purchase. I received all packages at one time, all components were intact and undamaged. I did contact customer service a couple times during shipping with some questions. They were extremely helpful and responsive via email.As with most items that require assembly I read many reviews that stated they had issues with the assembly and many who didn't. Mine is the 12x16 and I assembled this with a friend in 4.5 hours. If you can follow simple directions it's not an issue at all. It's pretty sturdy when completely assembled but keep in mind it is aluminum and does have a slight flex to it. All in all I am very happy with this it was a great addition to our patio.Really Liking This Gazebo - My husband put it together pretty much by himself - I only had to help him move it around when needed. It doesn't feel real heavy before putting all the panels and cross bars in, but appears to be very sturdy after it was all put together. We anchored ours into concrete. If you get a windy day and have everything zipped up - watch out the zippers unzip themselves but that is better than the fabric tearing - thinking about putting some weights on the bottom of the curtains so they don't move so much as we have a fire pit in the center of ours and would prefer that the curtains don't blow towards the fire - the only thing we don't like is on the vent system - it is not screened so even with the mosquito netting closed we still get bugs - we will be installing netting up around the vent to help prevent that.First, if you didn�t purchase this model in it�s available sizes, you commented on the wrong model. This isn�t a flimsy model and is quite sturdy and doesn�t leak. We�ve had 2 torrential downpours with wind gusts. Pictorial instructions were quite simple to follow. I assembled this unit 99% by myself and needed a little help from my wife and or my granddaughter on several occasions. This unit is in the blazing sun most of the day and is considerably cooler than surrounding area of the deck. The top is an opaque polycarbonate and let�s in a sufficient amount of light. Several tracks and other components were bent but easily bent back into shape and not noticeable. I will be installing lighting and hanging fan in near future. I took my time and didn�t rush and did a couple of hours a day. Total time about 7 1/2 hours.Update 07/10/2021Just went through tropical storm Elsa. All panels were watertight and held in place with 55mph winds. ????????????????????Update 09/12/2021This gazebo went through Henri and Ida with flying colors. Panels were secure and no leaks at channels. Highly recommend.Update 02/02/2022Just went through a Nor�easter that dropped 15� of snow and strong winds. This gazebo survived with flying colors. ????Easy to assemble, you need at least 2-3 persons to assemble in maybe 4-5 hours. In reference to sturdiness; this gazebo is medium and light, it can be moved from place to place if needed. Since we wanted to stay put in one place we bought some extra materials to anchor it on the concrete base we had built before buying it: love it in reference to price is maybe $200.-$300. Overpriced we paid over $1800. For this item , you may find similar ones for $1200.-$1500.Pro's:","Pro's:

OPTIMAL SUPPORT � The extra long quick touch fastener strap provides enhanced support during training, along with improving alignment that help the user during training sessions.Ok So i have tried 2 the Venom Challenger 2.0 gloves and the everest gloves, i didnt like them too much. As soon as i wore these...oh..my...god.First of all, unlike the Venom and Everest gloves, these are solid. The other gloves were wear on the wrist support and even with wraps it didnt fel right. These are solid on the support. you can BARELY move the wrist downward. THAT IS AMAZING. Unlike the other gloves, these arnt too heavily padded looking to the point where idk where im hitting. With other gloves, when i hit the bag it feels like im hitting with my..those bones below the knuckles..lol. With these gloves when i hit, i hit with the knuckles. It feels like im not even wearing the gloves.Just WOW. There was one thing i didnt like tho. I didnt really like the colors. i wanted the glove to be white just like the Venom Challenger 2.0 gloves. Thats kind of what made me not want to order these. But im glad i did. I found my gloves!My spouse has been thrilled with these. The difference a punch can make with the right gloves is amazing. The fit is snug, though you'll be able to fit your handwraps in well, especially by your second session. They look great in gold and white. They're breathable and balanced, and can handle those long pad or bag sessions well. The padding is great, and your hands, knuckles, and wrist will be well protected.So far I used my RDX Ego Boxing Gloves for 3 Muay Thai training sessions. I find they fit tighter and support my wrists far better than my old gloves that were more expensive They help correct a tendency I have to roll my wrist with hooks and uppercuts when I tire practicing combinations or sparring. The wrist strap and velcro are stronger than the old gloves so I expect they'll hold up long enough to justify buying another pair.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product. Initially, I was deciding between Venum and RDX as they both have good reviews. I went with RDX because I found these more solid looking as opposed to the puffy and fluffy look of the Venum ones. Aside from that multiple boxing friends also recommend them. I am glad I went with the RDX. They have very tight and thin profile while being very well padded; very solid and slick looking in general. My primary use for them is for weekend sparring sessions (I don't frequently do heavy bag work so I'm not sure how they perform over time). However, using them as sparring gloves is perfect. They are snug and padded enough that I could use them without hand wraps, yet if I do decide to use hand wraps they would still fit. Our style of fighting has a lot of friction, not just limited to head-on impact. and these gloves really hold up well. It's been seven months since I been using them, I barely see any scratch on them. And just so you know, I get a lot of cuts and scratches all over my arms from our sparring sessions, but nothing on these gloves. I shredded two pairs of Everlast Gel boxing gloves from these sparring sessions that after every class I had to pick up the little pieces of composite leathers on the floor, it was a mess! Finally I decided to upgrade to these. These gloves are much more economical than the Venum ones. And to me, these are as good as they can be. I mean... how much more can you spend on gloves that gives you the same protection and durability. Anymore money you spend on trivial improvements are really extra. They slip on quickly and stay on well. My classmates ask me about them and tried them. Some ended up getting them as well. They come in a variety of colors. Somehow remind me of PowerRangers lol. In conclusion, they really are a good pair of gloves. There's really nothing to complain about them. Unless I discover some design flaws to them someday, I would always buy the same gloves in the future when these current ones are worn out.nanPro's:","Pro's:

I had no issues with using it, besides the OSD being a bit finicky. The few reason I bought this are because of the price point and the warranty. I bought it for around $430 and it was great. Give it about 4 months and I accidentally scratch the screen pretty badly. I think �well, okay I�ll just use their 1-year 1-time accidental damage warranty to replace it.� My first call to customer service and they had construction work in the background and my voice echoed so bad I had to put them on speaker. I ask to use my one time warranty, and get this- they didn�t ask me for order invoice, address, serial number- none of that. They ask what damage it was so I told them the screen was scratched. They proceed to tell me that the accidental damage warranty only covers cracked screens, which I say �BS� I�m on their website and they claim it covers �all accidental damage including monitors falling on the floor, acts of God, or even nuclear war. One incident covered, for up to 1-year from the date of the purchase.� So I say �you�re telling me the warranty covers nuclear war and all accidental damage but not a scratched screen?� And he says �I guess so.� So now I paid $430 for a decent monitor and a scam of a warranty. An absolute scam and a blatant lie. Either that or they need to fire that man and actually maintain their reputation.Coming from an IPS display, i was a bit worried reading the review about color accuracy and image looking washed out and its True! Out the box. I thought about returning it, viewing angle was not great, color was off seem washed out as everyone mentioned, but after doing some research and missing with settings, i can say i am impressed. Colors pop and some how seems more vibrant and deep than my replacement IPS monitor. Viewing angle still not like IPS but who use the monitor at an angle? For the price and after calibration this monitor is absolutely amazing and exceeded my expectation. Also i get no flickering or any other anomaly mention about VA panel. Build quality and stand adjust great as well. Would recommend this to anyone who�s skeptic. I know i was at first.Specs:Asrock B450 pro matx moboRyzen 2600x3200 DDR4GTX 1080 FEM.2 480 GBWin10 64 bit proMonitor Setting:Brightness 40Contrast 50Gamma 3Color User defineAdaptive sync OnThis replaced my Dell 2716DG, a gsync 144hz 2560x1440p TN monitor. I had always wanted to get an ultrawide, but couldn't bring myself to spend more than 500 dollars. This monitor was released and had the features I wanted at the price point I wanted. As with most monitors, the secret sauce is in the settings. I've never had a monitor that didn't look better after some settings tweaks.This monitor has freesync instead of gsync. When I first used gsync in 2016 it became a must have feature. Then I built a new rig and moved from Windows 7 to 10. Windows sometimes breaks gsync, making the price premium for it no longer part of my purchasing decision. While this monitor isn't gsync certified you can enable it via the Nvidia control panel. At first I would get intermittent black screens that would last a few seconds with gsync enabled. Needless to say this was ruining my gaming experience, so I looked for a solution. First I downloaded new drivers from AOC's website and manually installed them. Problem persisted. Then I updated the driver on my 1080ti. Problem persisted. I tried using a program to change the freesync range which some people claimed helped. No dice. Finally I found a solution that worked:1. Make sure freesync is set to ON in your monitor's onboard controls2. Right click on the desktop and go to the Nvidia control panel3. Set up gsync in ""Set Up G-Sync""4. Select Manage 3D settings.5. Change ""Monitor Technology"" to Fixed Refresh6. Select the ""Program Settings"" tab within manage 3D settings7. Select the game you want to run8. Change Monitor Technology to G-sync9. Do this for every game you want to play with G-syncFor some reason this works. No more black screens! My rig is Windows 10, 9900K, 1080ti with latest drivers.Coming from a TN the colors were a bit better, but it wasn't a life changing experience. Apparently my previous monitor was dialed in pretty good. The pixel response isn't as fast as my old TN, but after a few days I don't notice it anymore. If you aren't Mr. E-Sports tournament guy it won't matter. If you are that kind of guy you probably aren't even looking at this monitor as an option.Now for the bad. The monitor often needs more brightness. Even with brightness set at 100 I still find myself upping the brightness in game settings. If a game doesn't have a brightness slider you can use ""Picture Boost"" in the monitor's on board settings. This is a great option. So why put it in the bad section of the review? The monitor doesn't remember this setting when you turn it off. If you need it for a game you have to reset it every damn time. AOC needs to update their firmware to fix this. It's keeping this good monitor from being truly great. Every time I want to play Assault Android Cactus I have to mess with this. Not cool.Beyond the black screen workaround and the picture boost not being saved I'm happy with this monitor. It was great step up from my 27 inch TN, and now I can never go back to regular sized monitors. Size does matter. It will probably be another four years until a 4K with comparable features is released at a reasonable price. I won't be allowed to purchase another monitor until then since my sister in law dimed me out and pointed out to the wife my new toy. That's the last time she stays with us during her spring break.J'ai fait de longues recherches avant d'acheter un �cran qui rassemble les sp�cifications suivantes a un prix abordable :34"" Ultrawide1440p (3440 x 1440)144hzVA Panel1 msFreesyncCet �cran rassemble tout �a < 600$ alors que pour avoir l'�quivalent la plupart des �crans qui ont ces sp�cifications sont encore > 1000$.niveau connectique vous avez 2 ports HDMI et 2 display port (Assurez vous d'utiliser le display port pour profiter du 144hz sinon vous serez � 100hz.) et il comprend aussi 4 port USB ce qui est tr�s pratique.Apr�s presque 1 mois d'utilisation je suis tr�s satisfait.Pas de pixel mort aucun probl�me.Le seul petit bemol et ce n'est pas assez pour que j�enl�ve une �toile est le fait que la navigation dans les menus avec les boutons n'est pas la plus intuitive et pratique mais on ne joue pas dans les r�glages de l'�cran tout les jours alors une fois bien param�tr� tout va bien.Apr�s malheureusement la disponibilit� sur amazon a �t� limit� et de courte dur�e.

The specs were better than those for the screens I had to return or cancel, and I read a great in-depth review on this screen that implied it was very good value for the price, so I took another chance on a brand I don't recognize.It came faster than expected during the Coronavirus pandemic, and despite a ding in the side of the box that didn't get through the protective styrofoam, it was in perfect condition. It assembled super easily and feels very sturdy, and can both turn and tilt (its width prevent rotating to portrait orientation of course). The ultra wide screen is impressive and much more pleasant and comfortable than the 2 screens I was using previously. I love the dark grey with dark satin red metal highlights.The picture is beautiful, bright, hi-res, with no dead pixels at all. Running at 3440x1440 at 144hz.

Text: Comes with Regular Glass and a sawtooth hanger for wall mounting. Made of MDF - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it. For other colors and standard sizes in this frame style search 'WOMFRBW26079-4x6' on amazon.com. Fits 14x17 inch Photos, Actual Frame size (finished size) is 16x19 inches and the frame is 1.25 inches wide. This black satin frame is our favorite gallery frame. This is our most versatile frame, photographs posters prints diploma's and certificates look amazing in this smooth and sophisticated frameAlmost really nice...So they package this as if it's glass. So the packaging is great! My poster looks much more prominent in this. The frame has no nicks or dings.However... I think they intended to cover both sides with a thin removable sheet of plastic to protect it from scratches. Mine had the back side only half covered and there's a few visible marks. And what really sucked is they stuck an awful to remove sticker on the front that says ""both sides peel off!"" except... Their was no plastic on the front. So they stuck the sticker right to the acrylic. In my attempt to remove all of the sticker, their is now a big ugly dull/faded area on the acrylic.This product is nice. Just make sure they package it right. And careful on their stupid sticker if you run into my situation.I needed a frame to display my new ""Temple of the Dog"" show poster (12X36) but didn't want to spend crazy money on it. After reading both positive and negative reviews for this frame I decided to roll the dice and grab one based solely on cost.... I'm so glad I did; the frame I received is fantastic for what I spent! Once you take the protective film off the plexi glass (both sides as displayed on the product) it's super clear. My package also included mounting hardware including a wall hook. The only thing that I can see to complain about is the frame backing which is cardboard but who cares??? The cardboard had no issues holding my concert poster in place and I'm the only one that will ever see the back. I'll be ordering more to complete our ""Wall of Concert Flyers""Really excited to get this but disappointed when I found that it doesnt actually fit a 19x23 picture... at first I thought I had mis-measured but measuring the inside it is actually for a 18x22 print (see pictures). So annoyed that I now have to repack and return such a large item. I measured multiple times and read the description (which says it would fit pictures 19x23) to avoid this.This frame was purchased to fit an inexpensive, oddly-sized print, and I was happy to find that such an unusual size was available for purchase without having to resort to a customized framing order. The product shipped quickly, and it was easy to assemble. It also looks fine on the wall. The problem, however, is the price. The product is very flimsily made, and for the price, the quality should be better. The seller either needs to improve the quality to match the price or reduce the price to match the quality. I've purchased better frames for lower prices at art stores, though, of course, it often is difficult to find nonstandard sizes.I don�t usually write amazon reviews as I typically agree with what�s been previously posted. Before I bought this I saw a lot of mixed reviews and was hesitant to purchase because of some of the negativity being brought on by others. Yes the clear solid that comes with it that allows you to view your framed object is Plexiglas. This is sort of funny because the box it ships in is glass. Yes it just has a cardboard back with those little metal bendy things to hold it in pace. And yes the frame itself is made out of some compressed particle board material. For my purposes though it worked great. I got what is pretty much a custom sized frame shipped to me in a few days through prime. There was a myriad of size choices and color choices. The packaging was great and the frame came out unscathed. It even came with a hanging kit although I did have to use a drill to attach the hooks to the frame itself. The Plexiglas is a little extra reflective but as other users have pointed out making your own custom cut glass isn't that hard if you really need it. For me though this worked. The object I am displaying is more than nice looking in this frame and that�s all I needed for it (the ability to put it on the wall and call attention to it). The cardboard functions well and I didn't pay an arm and a leg for a custom frame job at a crafts store with a 'museum quality' frame, not to mention the quick shipping time. Last I checked they were $100+ with a coupon. So if you�re hanging some great family heirloom or something you might want to go to the crafts store but if you�re hanging that finger painting you�re 5 year old did in art class these are perfect.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Nominal size: 16x20x1; Actual size 15 3/4""x 19 3/4"" x 3/4""; This MERV 11 filter is comparable with MPR 1000-1200 & FPR 7.. Designed to filter microscopic particles such as lint, dust mites, spores, pollen, pet dander, fine dust, and smoke. Simple to install and a cost-effective step towards a healthier home environment. For best results, change your filters every 60 to 90 days but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months. 100% synthetic electrostatic media for high efficiency with low air flow resistance. Manufactured in the USA by Filtration Group, a world-leading manufacturer and supplier of filtration solutions making the world safer, healthier & more productiveThese filters have cost me a lot of money! I ordered these a while back 4 1/2 months ago to be exact. I started using them 2 months ago. I came home 7 weeks ago to a very hot house. Went out and the A/C was frozen up. I unthawed it and called a A/C company to figure out what was going on. Everything checked out. Went 2 weeks with cooler weather and everything was great. It got hot again and it froze up again. I called a different company and everything was fine. A total of 4 companies and over $700 in service call fees I finally figured it out on my own. It was frozen up and I let it unthaw again and took out the filter and put back in a cheap one and have had no problems. I�ve called 2 of the companies and met them to show them the filters and they said to never purchase again. It wasn�t allowing air to flow because they were to thick and are not made of materials to filter. Smh. Amazon should refund me every dollar with the money they make ripping people off with such junk.I ordered these for the first time in 16x20x1 in a 4 pack.Cons: I was surprised they weren't individually wrapped in plastic.Pros: These are ""cheap"" filters, but that's exactly what I wanted. If i order allergen rated high filtration filters, my old furnace just overheats and shuts off due to air flow restriction. These seem good so far.Sizing:The biggest complaint I saw from others on these filters is that they're not a literal size. Meaning a 16x20x1 filter isn't LITERALLY 16 inches x 20 inches x 1 inch.I replaced a 16x20x1 from another brand with this. It was the same size as the other 6 companies I bought from. They're all the same (correct) size. Granted I haven't ordered every size this company makes, but what I ordered was the size that I expected, and the same size you'd get from every other brand.Basically, the people complaining that they're not the right size probably have no idea what size their furnace needs. Look at the older filter label, order that size. Job done.I am a medical facility operations advisor filters that are not stamped with a ""A"" rating like MERV 13A or MERV 9A will loose the rating quickly so a MERV 13 might become a MERV 11 after 30 days.With large air handlers you have ""pre, intermediate, final, and last stop HEPA"" those HEPAs get those tiny buggers like TB.So with standard home filters best to change every 30 days so you don't plug up ypur evaporator.Or if you can get into your air handler unit (AHU) wash your evaporator every year like your condenser outside.Hope not too deep I really could have gone alot deeper.My daughter is allergic to so many airborne things, including cat dander (we have four). Since switching to these filters (instead of the 3M allergen ones we'd been using) she hasn't had to use an inhaler! Yes, she takes a daily dose of Zyrtec, but she started doing that long before we switched filters and still needed daily puffs. Besides eliminating my daughter's need for an inhaler, I *know* these filters work better just by looking at them because they catch SO MUCH MORE junk. There were times when we went three months without changing a 3M filter, and even then, they didn't have as much junk on them as one of these Aerostar filters catches in one month. Seriously, give these filters a try! You have nothing to lose because they're a lot less expensive. The only downsides are: a) You will have to change these more frequently because they work SO much better. b) For some reason, they aren't sized exactly as labeled--about 1/4 inch shorter both width and lengthwise. However, they're still less expensive than other brands that don't work as well, even if you use one a month, and the size issue isn't really an issue unless you sleep right next to your furnace (because there might be a slight noise when your air starts and stops since these run small). Our furnace is in the basement, so we never hear it.Terrific product, especially when compared to what's available at the big box stores. The only negative I've seen is that I have to change them more frequently.I live in Colorado, and we've been having more forest fires lately. In the past, fires have been noticeable indoors by the smell. With these filters, I don't notice that smell, and I hope that means I'm getting less junk in my lungs.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Made with 20 gram of high quality whey and milk protein to help rebuild your muscles so you come back strong. 42g of carbs per bar to replenishing and get ready for tomorrow's workout. Scientifically developed for athletes, each bar contains protein and carbs to rebuild and refuel. The protein bar used by the NFL, NHL, NBA and MLB is now available to you, Includes 12 chocolate chip bars. 350 calories, 20g protein, 42g Carbs. Individually wrapped to enjoy at the gym, off the field, or on the goThese seem to fall into the faux ""healthy"" segment that's so popular these days. Bottom line, they're candy bars that have some added protein. Sickeningly sweet to the point that I couldn't finish a whole bar. They're 36% sugar compared to something like the Clif Whey Protein bar that's 9% sugar. If you feel judged for eating a Snickers and you want more protein then by all means buy these but if you're looking for a healthy addition between meals then look elsewhere.Got this at a great price. My son really loves this bar. He is at school long hours some days (college). It is a fast snack and very tasty. He is a very active young man into lifting and physical activity. The caloric content and sugar values do not bother me in regards to this protein bar. He is not getting enough food some days so this is a good way to push some protein and quick energy back in his day. I'm over 40 so I won't be eating these bars. I am not physically active enough and these bars are so good (like candy bars) that eating one and another would be calling me. My first introduction was a free bar from our local grocery store. When I ran the Weight Watcher numbers on half the bar AFTER I ate it I knew this was not something I could handle. total chocolate and sugar trigger. So be warned if you have issues over eating. The bars taste fantastic and are great for that person that is very active and can burn it off but has no time to stop and get a meal or just needs a fast pick me up.Although they taste great, they are bad for you because they are full of refined carbs and sugar. That will raise Insulin and cause weight gain.Whey protein will feminize men, it is estrogenic. That could cause prostate issues...All soy today is GMO (genetically modified). No one really knows how that is changing your body.Soy ALSO slows people�s thyroid. That will cause weight gain in men AND women.Soy is ALSO very estrogenic, so it will feminize men too. It is a hormone disruptor for women & children too.These contain a TON of soy. Soy is used because it has protein and it�s CHEAP � allowing the company to say it has protein yet reap huge profits, AT YOUR HEALTH�S EXPENSE. There are better non-GMO non-estrogenic non-endocrine disrupting sources of protein � but those would reduce profits...Basically, if you want a candy bar marketed as healthy and you want to gain weight and disrupt your Insulin, Thyroid AND Sex hormones, here you go.Also they must contain some unlisted ingredient that makes them almost addictive. I cannot even have ONE, or it will be weeks before I can stop.Nearly every single photo on this advertisement is an athlete or sports-related. Anybody with a halfway functioning brain can discern that these are for active people. If you can't fit 30g of sugar (which to be clear is 120 calories and can be worked off with an 8 minute jog) then you are too fat or too neurotic to be bothering with protein bars. And if you're worried about your ""health"" you should follow current research on nutrition; sugar is perfectly fine for active people.These taste great and are much, much cheaper than other protein bars out there.These protein bars are kind of like a big snack/meal replacement at 350 calories and 20 grams of protein, so go easy. It's hard to go easy because they taste like candy! I thought I was eating a Snickers with protein. I actually broke a little piece off and examined on a plate with my hands. The chocolate melted, as real chocolate tends to do. There was nothing that looked remarkable or strange, like some protein bars do. For example, no very hard or chewy elements, unmeltable ""chocolate"", or very dense at a small size. This seemed as natural as a packaged protein bar could get. It really is helpful after a workout or when you're on the road and need to eat and don't want to bother with a strange tasting protein bar or you don't have time to make a shake. Having one will also satisfy your sweet tooth so you won't stop at 7/11 or the exits with fast food. The only real downside is the sugar content. While the sugar provides instant calories and taste, it's not good for cancer or diabetic patients or even the keto and Paleo peeps, and I think a stevia version would help. So if you're watching your sugar, go easy with these and watch your daily sugar if you eat one to balance it all out. However, if you want a protein bar that tastes like a Snickers, here you go!Pro's:","Pro's:

Don't forget to bleed the bottle, simple procedure, with a flat screwdriver, remove slightly the rubber cap to release the air inside(after pumping it 6 or 8 times with the valve closed).Great product for the low price. This is the second one I purchased. The first one was $20 and the second one was slightly over $17 delivered with Amazon Prime. I love Amazon Prime. This jack is smaller than the old small floor jacks use to be. I got the second one for my SUV after having a flat tire recently and could not get my vehilce high enough when towing (and the flat was on the rear tire). I put the second jack in a plastic container with a lid. This plastic box also contains other emergency its for my vehicle.Ive had one before and had no complaints about this. The box did come beat to hell covered with tape, but once I got through that and check everything, the jack was undamaged, still had the new tags on it, and all the parts were present. Other than that, this is a good jack.I like this little floor jack because it is small, relatively light weight and it is more than adequate to lift my Nissan Maxima. But what I like most of all is it was a special purchase item from Amazon for only $17. Time will tell, but it works well now and if I get a year's worth of use out of it, I will be happy. If you have issues with it not lifting your vehicle high enough, bring some wood to take up space or buy a larger jack. This works well for me.Considering this price, the product seemed like some sort of scam at first.... Nevertheless, it is easy to use and gets the job done for people who just need a jack to change a tire or oil.

Text: Width : 1.5mm. Guaranteed 14k Real Gold and ""14k"" Stamped. NO gold plated or filled. ""NO Question Asked"" 30-day Return Policy.. Promptly Packaged with Free Gift BoxUPDATE: Because I was so happy with the first chain I purchased, I've now bought a second one in yellow gold, to hang my gold charms. One very important PLUS for me is that both of these pendants/charms used to constantly spin, or turn on their old, thin chains. They would always end up hanging backwards, which drove me crazy. With this chain, both of these pendants now always face forward as they should, no matter how much I swing my neck around. YAY! I saw mixed reviews for this chain (mostly very good) and thought I'd share my opinion/experience. I'm very happy with it. I had bought this rose gold pendant, that came with the flimsiest, thinnest, too-short (16"") chain, that hung too high on my throat. I wanted a nicer chain, in 18"" length (which hangs just above most necklines I wear). A couple people thought this chain is too thin/flimsy. I disagree! In my opinion, when wearing a chain ALONE, you may want a heavy chain, but with a pendant , the pendant should be the STAR of the show. The chain should be substantial enough to look 'nice' against your neck, and hold the pendant securely, but should let the pendant/stone stand out, not overpower it. I think I learned this as I got older ;) It looks very pretty, simple and elegant, but not 'plain', and has a bit of sparkle. The clasp is not heavy-duty, but is pretty standard to almost every other chain I've ever had, and I feel it's secure. Get it - you will probably be very happy with it, especially for the price, which I thought was very reasonable. I tried to take closeup photos showing the true color, and link style. Hope this helps you decide!I had been looking everywhere for a 14k white gold chain for my 1CT diamond pendant, to replace the crappy, thin box chain that originally came with the pendant. This is perfect -- delicate yet sturdy, and has a little sparkle to it as well. Yes, the lobster clasp is small, but it is the appropriate size for the chain. Extremely happy with this purchase.Bought for wife, too long so I kept it for myself. Put my old (50 yrs. old) dog tags on it so when they find me lost in the neighborhood they'll know I have good taste. DCRI purchased this product for my own use. I rarely wear jewelry and have only worn it 5 or 6 times and the clasp fell off and then the links started coming apart. It completely tarnished also. When I wrote to the seller they basically said it's a rhodium coating and not real gold ( as was implied) and they would not be able to replace it even though it was falling apart. I would definitely stay away from this vendor as jewelry should last for years not just a couple of months!1.20.2021 update-This is the best purchase I made in all of last year. I wear my necklace 24/7 never take it off and it has yet to let me down! It has been unwaveringly strong, ridiculously shiny and perfect in every way. So glad I bought, it. Buying another one in rose gold today. Thank you for a high quality product.Busy mommaI appreciate the solid gold links but light weight. I appreciate the shine of the metal. The clasp works well for my (pre-purchased) pendant. I plan to wear it without taking it off so, I will update this review with any issues in encounter.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Width : 0.9mm. Guaranteed 14k Real Gold and ""14k"" Stamped. NO gold plated or filled. ""NO Question Asked"" 30-day Return Policy.. Promptly Packaged with Free Gift BoxI bought this necklace to replace one that broke. I am only able to wear gold due to a nickel allergy. This necklace is NOT 14k gold! Every time I wear it I end up with hives.This is so much better than I expected, because of the price I was expecting to have to return it. I have a pretty big pendant hanging from it and it's awesome. I absolutely love it and would definitely not only purchase it again but I would recommend it. The thing I love the most is that my hair does not get tangled into it. I have so many chains that my hair gets wrapped up and tangled up in. This is not only a great value but good looking as well!I purchased the 16"" white gold chain. I have been wearing this chain for almost 2 months now with no issues. I wear it to bed and while showering or swimming. It has held up great. It is very shiny and the length is perfect- the pendant no longer hides beneath most of my shirts now. The price great considering what other places charge for such quality. I would suggest this chain to anyone.Very satisfied! Love it!this necklace is not real gold and will burn and turn black when exposed to heat!! paid alnost 200 for a fake necklace shame on your company for false advertising!!Pro's:","Pro's:

We had some pretty big gusts of wind where I held my breathe waiting for them to pass but the tent held up and stayed right where I put it. I used the weighted bags filled with sand and nothing else. It rained a bit on the second day with no leaks. The walls and top were completely dry within 2 hours so I was able to pack it up without wiping it down. Went up and took it down within a few short minutes with two people. Great purchase!This is the ultimate in canopy tents! I love everything about it except 1 thing. It's heavy and you need 1 strong, and tall guy to help put it up. Other than that, it's well made, the side walls are quality, the frame heavy duty, the sandbags durable and it's not at all complicated. It's just not for a 5'3"" old lady to put up by herself.This is a fabulous tent. It is easy enough for me to set up by myself if I need to (I'm 5' 4' and sort of on the delicate side) though it IS a bit heavy for me to transport. The wheels on the outer storage cover are helpful but one spins out of it's axel and needs to be put back in frequently. The fabric is sturdy but not so heavy that it is opaque - in fact the white canopy acts sort of like a light tent on a clear day so that all of the colors in my scarves are easy to see and everything looks bright and fresh. I haven't had to use the side weights yet as the tent stakes themselves have been sturdy enough for me so far. I love that I can have just one or all walls depending on the weather and where my booth is placed in a show.I looked at so many tents before chosing this one. I am so happy with my choice. It is easy to set up (I even manage it alone when needed), it is very sturdy, and the extras like the side panels, the heavy duty wheeled bag, and the included weight bags make this a great deal! At my first market, other vendors were checking it out and couldn't believe how good the quality was and all that was included for the price.The top canopy is very thick and yet it doesn't block out light. It is so bright under the tent! I use the door panel on the back so we can exit easily and get ventilation without having to remove the whole panel. Other vendors have commented on how nice the door panel is. For my first year at the markets, I was thrilled to learn I had chosen a great tent. It is a great package!I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TENT!!!! I have 2 Rods and 4 fusions in my back, I make Organic Potions and with help, I attend special indoor shows during the ""off"" seasons, but I really wanted to attend outdoor events throughout the season and Beautiful Weather ! What I needed, was a good, strong ""commercial type tent for my outdoor shows. It also had specific criteria it had to meet; fire retardant, waterproof, weights to attach to the legs (in order to keep it from blowing over) and it had to be white. I've been researching tents, a long time now. Searching for the best tent available, reading many, many reviews!! I wanted a sturdy, strong, MADE IN THE USA, White, 10 x 10 tent, so I could attend more out door vendor shows during the spring, summer and fall seasons. In my area, organizers sponsering outdoor shows, require vendors to have a 10 x 10 tent and ALL tents Must meet their safety guidelines. Prior to the opening of their event, all tents are inspected. If they do not meet their specs, vendors have the following options: to rent one of the organizers tents, (if they have them), do without, or loose your booth space and the money paid to rent a booth.After a Very Long Search, I decided on the Eurmax 10 x 10 Ez Pop-Up Canopy Tent!! O M G O S H ! ! I AM SO HAPPY I DID !! It by far Exceeded All my Expectations!!!!First: The Frame is made up of strong, thicker Square steel Pieces, that also has a Very nice powdercoat finish, (keeping it from easily rusting!!) Not the flimsy, thin, alliumin Sissor frames, that I've seen on most all of the other tents. (they must be disposable!!)Second: The Thick, Canvas like material used for the Canopy, and Sidewalls. The Seams are double stitched, and covered!! The parts of the canopy that is placed over each corner of the frame and in the middle of the structure, is DOUBLED THE MATERIAL TO STRENGTHEN IT !AND, ON EACH CORNER THERES ALSO VELCRO not only sewed into the canopy material but where it attaches on the steel posts, the velcro is screwed onto the steel, not just ""stuck"" with tape or glue!!! The Quality of the whole package... is Nothing more than amazing... Oh, another Great part, I think I mentioned to you about my disability... this tent is so well made, that with the help of my Husband, it takes literally minutes to set up! The first time we set it up took less then 4 minutes! and we werent even trying to rush it!! Its so easy to put up, I might even be able to put it up by myself!! LOL!! Thanks You Guys...more than I can say !! I am MORE THAN IMPRESSED, I'm Proud... that the quality and pride of things made in the USA, is still ALIVE & WELL.. Thank You, For the Amazing Product you make and offer at such an Incredible price!!Do I Recommend this to others!?!?! ABSOLUTELY!!!!! And, I will be telling all my fellow vendors at shows, THIS IS WHERE THEY NEED TO PURCHASE THEIR TENTS!! BTW.. Their Customer Service.. Second to None!!!Thanks Again...Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Victorian style; decorative gold facing with beaded inlay and darker gold sidewall. Frame includes: clear acrylic facing, rigid cardboard backing and wire hanging hardware kit (some assembly required). Frame holds a 17 inch by 22 inch photo/print/poster (viewable area is reduced by .25"" on each side due to the frame lip). Frame moulding is 0.75 inches wide; real poplar; solid wood. Made in the U.S.A.Well made frame. It tolerated my clumsy ""carpentry"" withot breaking. I've been painting on stretched canvas for a number of years but this is the first time I have framed one. I'm perfectly happy with the results.I received this frame today and couldn't be happier! I purchased it to hold my college diploma (yay!) and it's perfectly ornate enough to look ""adult"" but not stuffy or gaudy at all. Also, such a great deal for what it is. The frame looks super expensive, but it's perfectly affordable. I was a little concerned about the thickness of the frame, but the outsides are no more than an a half an inch. Another bonus, it comes with the mounting instruments, and the ""teeth"" on the back are positioned for it to be mounted horizontally OR vertically. If you're on the edge about purchasing, I hope this review persuades you into doing so! Great frame for a great price. Looks super awesome on a wall.I bought this frame (8 x 12, gold) for a signed print I bought. The print itself is an awkward size at about 8 3/5 and 11 1/2. This was the second frame I bought for it, the first one being way too small. I was hoping I wouldn�t have to cut the picture down, as some frames come with a little bit of room to spare that the frame actually covers. Sadly, I did end up cutting about 1/8 off of each side mainly because I didn�t want to send back another frame but also because I think this frame size is the closest I would get to an accurate fit. It�s a nice frame, solid construction, and came packaged really well and frustration free! My print looks awesome and the frame fits in great with my other frames. I have no regrets and am thankful I found a frame in this size.This frame fit my 16 x 20 canvas perfectly. The width of the canvas was 1/2�, which was completely hidden by the frame. I did not use the plexiglass front. Very happy with the quality.We've ordered three different Craig frames and have been completely satisfied with the quality, particularly given the reasonable price. If we had to buy frames locally, or have pictures framed at a shop, the cost would be much higher. We are particularly impressed with the meticulous packaging. It is so well packed, that even maltreatment by a delivery person is unlikely to harm the frame. The plexiglass insert is covered on both sides with tightly adhered cling film to prevent scratching. (Be sure to remove film from BOTH sides.) All in all, this is a true bargain.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: This 20""x30"" frame perfectly showcases your favorite photos, posters, or art prints.. Profile of each frame is 1. 125"" wide with a gray woodgrain finish. Each frame is made of MDF wood with plastic styrene front to prevent breakage.. Frames include pre-attached sawtooth hangers for vertical or horizontal wall hanging. Easy to open turn buttons make adding your photograph a breeze. Included Components: 1 FramenanThese are perfect frames. I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color. Overall I'm happy with the purchase! Doesn't look or feel like cheap frame material, so I think it's worth the price.Pro's:","Pro's:

FLASH MEMORY CARD: Performance and reliability you can count on from the flash memory brand; All firmware and components are produced in-houseSo most of the reviews here were done with previous gen SD card readers. These new gen EVO Select cards comply to new standards and those new standards require new card readers in order to get the full speed the card is capable of. You'll need a latest gen card reader to get the upgraded speed for your computer.Samsung has a new card reader, but it seems that you cannot buy it separately, at least I cannot find it for sale separately after searching everywhere, including Samsung's website.�256 GB (BLUE) NEW GENERATIONAdvertised: UP to 130 MB/sACTUAL TESTED with AJA:WRITE: 27 MB/sREAD: 29 MB/sGreat value for the price and speed, and these blue ones are the newer version of the older green ones which are bohth U3 speed but most people who test the new blue ones show about a 10% transfer rate increase so try to get the newer blue ones if you can since they are the same price. Yes they are fast enough to work for all dashcams that can accept a 256GB card because it is U3 speed not U1. Yes you can format it to look like a smaller card and use it in older dashcams that can't use a 256GB card. Yes it is definitely fast enough for any GoPro because it is U3 speed. Yes it is waterproof and heat proof...I use it in the desert where the inside of my car gets to 180F. Yes it's lifespan is fine in my dashcam even though the card isn't rated as ""high endurance"" and I've never had one fail even though most of my cards have been in my dashcams for 2-3 years being used every day...the ""high endurance"" ones will just allow you to rewrite them more times than these so you'll get maybe 25%-33% greater lifespan with those but my normal ones have lasted close to 4yrs so far so I don't feel there is any need for me to buy the more expensive ""high endurance"" ones.256GB Review: I bought this SD card because it has fast rated speeds, and it has a good price for those speeds. When I got it, I ran a benchmark, and the speeds aren't as good as expected. I don't think that what I will be using the card for will saturate these speeds, but they're still below the rated speed.64GB Review: I bought 4 of these these because they weren't much more than bundles of ""slower"" SD cards, however, now that I have them, I may have been able to save money and get faster cards if I went with a different option. Read speeds are consistent with the 256GB card, however the sequential write speeds on all 4 cards are much slower than the 256GB card.I have averaged the speeds of all 4 64GB cards, and I have attached images of the fastest and slowest cards going by write speeds.Q8 SEQ Read: 97.94MB/s (All of the cards I have got this exact speed, weird, but I'll take it.)Q8 SEQ Write: 34.71MB/sQ1 SEQ Read: 94.53MB/sQ1 SEQ Write: 34.55MB/sQ32 RND4K Read: 12.21MB/sQ32 RND4K Write: 4.08MB/sQ1 RND4K Read: 9.95MB/sQ1 RND4K Write: 3.49MB/sI have ran these tests on a Rocketek ?RT-TFU3R-B, however I have tested the 256GB card and a 64GB card in 3 other USB card readers and a PCIe card reader. There were no statistically significant differences in the speeds.These 64GB cards will also be used for purposes where I am unlikely to notice the slower speeds, however, I have reduced the rating to three stars because of how much slower the 64GB cards are. If all of these cards still work a year from now, I will up my review to 4 stars. However with how my luck is with flash media, that will be very unlikely.This review is for the 512gb version which as up to 130/mbps read speeds advertised. Upon using the Blackmagic Disk speed testing software, I got a maximum of 90 read and 75 write. I used the Samsung SD card adapter so no issue on that end.

I usually get the 14 16 18 20 , and I�ve never had a problem with it. And as a working girl and college girl I need affordable hair that will last through a sew in. These pictures are of my hair when I got it installed and when it was straighten . I prefer the hair to be either straight or curled with flexi rods because the natural body wave texture kinda fades away once you wash it. The body wave texture when you get the hair is pretty tho.

Straightens well but better to keep curls in it. My stylist measured it and it wasn't the 20' I purchased. It does color well and I've experienced minimal tangles. It does shed a bit.This wig looked nothing like the pic. It was so horrible I had to cut and style it myself. It also shed badly and you cannot part it on the side or anything. This is notnpre plucked and the baby hair was a joke. They offer $20 refund for 5 star reviews. I don't care about the refund I was suckered in by the reviews, but I should have looked at the videos.This hair is the best hair I ever bought. If anyone looking for Brazilian body wave search no more Gabrielle Brazilian is the best hair it does not she'd are tangled very soft. I'll order again . I strongly recommend.First things first, my expectations were not high for this hair given what I paid. That said, it's decent hair for the price but feels like any other human hair you can purchase for your local beauty supply. Its most definitely NOT virgin hair, NOT unprocessed and tangles very easily. It had a strong smell when I first got the hair that did not go away until I co-washed a second time. I also got what appeared to be a dye stream when I washed both times.I don't mind its natural texture and once it's completely dry it does have a little more ""body"".

SmartThinQ Works with Google Assistant/Amazon Alexa. 3 Fan Speeds - 3 in 1 Operation - Wi-Fi Connection. DUAL Inverter Compressor - Remote Control. Energy Efficient - Sleep Mode. Weight: 78.00 lbs - 115 VoltsThere�s a reason this thing is hard to find. And rather expensive. I had one since last summer. But, my roommate needed on for her large bedroom with no air flow. When I say hotbox, I�m not exaggerating. We couldn�t find one anywhere around us, so we ordered on Amazon from New York. The air conditioner cools my roommates room like a dream! There�s a reason it�s the best rated one for three years.Bought and used this unit for the summer of 2021. Worked as advertised all summer in hot muggy mid-Atlantic US. Drained the water and put it away for the fall and winter. Pulled it out today in 90+ degree weather. Had it up and running in under 10 minutes. (It takes a few minutes to seal the window around the exhaust hose.) Started right up and began to cool. We only ever used the unit on a Low fan speed last year. It's that good. But as its first day this year was super hot outside, I pressed Medium and got a start. Medium speed would not engage. Nor High. Uh oh. I heard LG customer was good, and the unit was still under warranty for parts and labor, but I did NOT want to return the unit for repair--if that is what was to follow. So I entered did an internet search entering the model number and ""fan speed"" and was immediately brought to a ""do you want to chat"" page. I did. Within one minute, I was chatting. After a few questions the issue was resolved. Everything now working great. (Who would have thought that using the remote to change the fan speed somehow unstuck the corresponding switch on the unit itself. I work in software and sometimes it just takes such a reset.) But kudos to the support team their responsiveness.Since you'll be reading this for a review of the unit, not just for the customer service detail, let me say that before upgrading to this top of the line unit, I brought home a top of the line unit from a competitor and set it all up. Much louder, much weaker, and I immediately returned it. I am very satisfied with what I get from this portable, and that I can just wheel it into the closet after the season.Received unit in a very beat up shipping box, but unit was undamaged. Got it set up and running in 40 minutes (unpacking and familiarizing). Worked marvelously!!! Consumer Reports rated this unit number 3, but I rate it number 1! Highly recommend.This air conditioner works very well. We use it upstairs to cool two rooms. The sleep setting is quiet and keeps us cool while sleeping. The cord is about 4 feet long and needs to be the only thing plugged in in that same outlet. They recommend not using an extension cord. So make sure you have a window near the outlet. It has it's own window attachment and hose. I made the mistake of needlessly purchasing these separately. I don't know how we survived without AC all these years.We have owned two other portable air conditioners and I have to say so far this one is thee best. Very, very easy setup. The phone app is a little bit of a pain to set up but once it is done it works very well! This unit also is very good at keeping the place cool.Pro's:","Pro's:

EASY CARE: Machine washable for easy care and maintenance, use only non-chlorine bleach when needed, tumble dry low and warm iron as neededI ordered this to have a ceiling to floor look. I have small rooms and wanted to make my room appear as large as possible. The length available was 1"" too long and I hemmed them. I am a seamstress and this fabric is the best I've ever worked with. This reminded me of wedding gown material - very thick and very luxurious. I read the reviews. One said that it was next to impossible to get the creases out where it was folded in the package. After I hemmed them, I set my iron on the highest setting I could that allowed steam. This was medium high. Three quarters around toward high. Because I read the review, I was resigned to have to iron my heart out. One go across it was steam and there was nery a wrinkle. Not one. It ironed SO easily. Not only the creases from packaging, but also the old hem crease that was there from the previous hem. WOW. I didn't iron the entire drape, just the new hem and I stuck three at a time in the dryer with a wet washcloth. 20 mins later they came out looking like they had never been folded ever. I'm afraid that lady who left that review worked much harder than she needed to. Buy these with confidence. You will not be disappointed. I am in love with the new clean look - that was EXACTLY everything I hoped it would be. ~KarenFor those that cannot figure out how to get wrinkles out of microfiber drapes, read and follow these ""SIMPLE"" instructions. Take a dish drying towel (all cotton type), soak it thoroughly, then wring it out where it is still damp. Place in clothes dryer with drapes set on air dry 10 - 15 minutes.Works every time.These are great for darkening rooms and saving energy.So beautiful. Very, very long... which I love. These are 108"", stone blue. They came just as described. As most reviews stated, you will need to iron them, but that is easily done. The fabric is soft, and very high quality. Really darkens the room.... not a cave by any means, but enough for this nightshift nurse to get some sleep!These are NOT blackout curtains. The look nice, but I bought them for our nursery, which lights up in the morning. Even in twilight, when I installed them, you can see light. And I have room-darkening blinds behind them. This is super frustrating, because they say ""blackout"" right in the title. I'll see what they look like in the morning, but 90% chance I'm sending these back and finding an alternative that really is blackout. Ugh.We bought these for a 14 year old boy�s bedroom. They aren�t super girly and look more durable than velvet drapes we have elsewhere in the house. They block the sun pretty well. The Dove Gray is a nice medium gray.Pro's:","Pro's:

Tent Height adjustment: 4 positions telescope legs. 9.5ft - 9.8ft - 10.1ft - 10.4ft (Maximum Peak Height Positions)I have had two of these for 2 years now! I bought them for my son's graduation party! The first time putting it up was a bit challenging, just because I had no clue as to how! ( you spread out the legs, snap in the tabs on the legs into the holes on the upper frame after extending the whole thing in all directions. Once you get those snapped in, put the canopy on..the upper spoke thingies are on a spring so you can pull them down to get it over, definitely a chair is helpful. Then you can extend the legs to the height you want!) It takes two people but is relatively simple and goes up fast. The quality is nice! Be careful of corners..I accidentally ripped one a tiny bit..but it was more my fault than the quality. It is fabric after all. I have also used these for camping! I had one trip where i used both together..using zip ties to hold the inner posts to each other..it was fantastic. It got pretty windy and the corners came up a bit..but we managed to re-secure them and they kept all of us dry in a pretty heavy rain! I absolutely am thrilled i got these..they have come in handy many times. The frames compared to some others i have seen are hefty and sturdy. They are heavy...so if you aren't that strong it might be an issue..i am a 51 year old woman that lifts weights...so i can manage them on my own..but honestly most women won't be able to lift them on their own.. I think in a pinch, now that i have put them up many times..i might even be able to do them by myself....but teenage sons come in handy for spreading out the frame..lol A metal spoon comes in handy when taking it back down to push in the little tabs..it hurt my fingers. Just a tip!I've owned and used this tent for about two years. I use it for events that I attend as a vendor. It's pretty heavy, but manageable to carry by yourself when folded up. I keep the top on when I fold it up with no issues. You really need at *least* 3 people to open this tent up. I was able to open it just using one other person, and it was a huge pain. If you have four people, it won't be an issue at all. I'm pretty rough on everything I own and this has stood up to the abuse. Due to the age, there are some small tears where the Velcro attaches, but that's understandable. Keep in mind, in high wind, this thing will take off. Trust me. Anchor it down or you'll be chasing it.I will most certainly buy another one of these.The thing leaks at the poles slightly due to stitch work, very strong material, I got 2 of these and the second one had upgraded materials which was stronger and heavier duty then the first, the first one a tree fell near it and the top of the branches tore the roof material but was able to gorilla tape it back together and shoot some flex seal spray on it for longevity. I had a couple older smaller cheaper gazebos and the tree branches destroyed them but not the new 10' x 20' easy up gazebos. Fix the stitch work on the patches where the 3 poles push up the roof and this thing will be a perfect solid waterproof easy up.I am using my canopy a lot for my Boy Scout Troop camping trips lately since I bought it in 2016. It was very useful over my tables, chairs and cooking patrol box and allow me to watch my Scouts around me. I have no problems in setting up and taking down with the fabric to take home to dry it out before storage for the next campout.Wonder if the seller will post replaceable tent (fabric) in case the original fabric wears out?You won�t find a bigger tent for cheaper and the quality is top notch. I bought 2 to use at the racetrack with very little hope they would make it through the weekend in the heavy wind and rain. But they did with ease.

Read the directions, I tried to be a warrior and not read them...read them, makes set up much easier. Very spacious tent with no pre work needed. I set it up to seal the seams, and they're already sealed, I left it up a couple days to air out and it stood strong even through a windy rain storm, did get a little moisture at the door, but thinking it was from the wind and me not having the rain fly on completely. Other than that this is a great tentWasn�t sure how this would handle high winds and rains but I was pleasantly surprised when it held up great with the big storm that came through Wednesday night on our camping trip! It�s spacious, and easy to set up (but it�s tall so the top part was a little tricky. Couldn�t get the poles through the metal loops so I�m not sure what those are for but other than that and the zipper getting stuck more easily than I�d like - great buy!Nice big tent! Easy to put up and take down. I don�t know if it�s rain proof cause we didn�t encounter rain. We stuck our daughters on one side and me and the hubby on the other.

I took it back apart and fixed it glass had some very small chips on the edges where the tabs were hitting but not visible when assembled. Manufacture should check tabs and glass before packaging this will eliminate glass breakage both frames were extremely well packaged and had no box damage.The frames were square and the joints mitered nicely. But the finish quality was not great. Areas at the joints had paint missing that I had to fix with a black sharpie. I will buy frames locally from now on.Great deal for the price.

Text: Tough vinyl cover. Pre-curved form fit. Wrist strap with hook-and-loop closureI was previously using heavily padded Everlast gloves which were fine, but was needing to take my boxing to the next level. These Title gloves were a huge part of that. I�m now making more accurate contacts, more powerful hits, and am able to make adjustments to my technique much easier using these. These were well worth the money for me, I would�ve even paid more.One thing to note about Amazon purchases in general, make sure to check where your product is sold from. The gloves I got from Amazon were sold from TITLE themselves, not some reseller. This way you can be sure you�re getting the real thing and not some knockoff.Very satisfied with these gloves. Great product especially for the price can�t beat that.(Update) 8/10/2018 I�ve been using these 5-6 days a week intensely for 8 months now And have been worn out. I believe These are designed for people training moderately 2-3 days a week still good gloves for the price.Update:Tried contacting to the seller and Amazon with little to no help. They�ve asked for photos without emailing and no way for me to provide photos.So posting the trash gloves here to provide them photos.Save the money and get real gloves that will last.They are already coming apart address in less than 3 months.Extremely disappointed and a waste of money. I�m past a return window as well.I�ve been using these for 6 months (I box 3-4 times a week) and they are all cracked on the outside- like you can see the foam under the outer material. The stitching is coming undone exposing the foam at the wrist. I was expecting these to last longer. Might be great for beginners or if you only plan to use sparingly, but for experienced/frequent boxers I would suggest opting for something of better quality.15 dollars for some freaking sweet gloves. They feel very comfortable and great quality for the price. My son, 10 yrs old, boxes in Cincinnati and they use these same gloves at the local gym. I wanted to get him the same for our house so he can work the mitts. The quality and price of these are hard to pass up. They fit great and are exactly what he needed!

It was huge, easy to put together and break down, took only a few minutes to put up and take down, and was well made. Very happy with this purchase.I bought this tent for the ease of setup, size, and the small awning over the D style door. The LED lights were a bonus and work well. The cost was more than a similar tent from another company, which I bought and returned due to leaks and poor stitching.There are a lot of stitches on a tent of this construction, and I expected at least some small leaks in a steady rain for six hours. Not a drop came through. Coming in from the rain was easier with the awning over the D door. I unzipped it down to about the top of the blue tub, and stepped over the threshold. This really prevented much water from coming in on entering.The color is nice too.You'll want to disconnect the usb on the batteries for the led's before packing, as the button to turn them on will activate the lights when rolling and putting in the carry bag.Overall this is a good tent and I'm happy with this purchase.OUR FIRST USE: We love this tent! We have not tried it at a camping site, but we set it up in the yard and were impressed with the ease of setup and all the great features. I wanted something I could set up by myself if I had to, and while it�s obviously easier with two or more people, it is manageable for one person. The cabin lights are awesome, and it has perfect ventilation. I would like more pockets inside, but that�s my only complaint.OUR SECOND USE: We just got out the tent again for yard camping (we haven't even gotten it to a campsite yet), and there were two things that were already broken, although we stored the tent inside and have only used it once before). The electronics panel for the light as come out and is just hanging outside of the compartment for it. We tried to put it back together, but it did not stay. Also, the zipper already broke on the screen enclosure. Again, we haven't even gotten this tent to a campsite, so these examples of poor quality are very frustrating. I would recommend not purchasing.Our first night with this tent we had a major storm. No leaking, no water from under tent. The only weird thing that happen is a mist came in from top. It was super easy to set up and take down. We are very happy with this tent. I strongly recommend this tent.Update: we just spent 5 days camping, with rain for most of it. We had storms one night for 8 hours straight. Still no leaks. We did get water in the tent when we opened the door. (Dripped of the door into tent. ) When we went to take the tent down, we found it in a puddle of water. Nothing leaked into the tent. We are amazed how great it did!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 8,000 BTU cooling - 890 W/7.8A; 4,200 BTU heating - 1320W/12.0A Dimensions: 14.5"" H x 24.2"" W x 20.3"" D. 300-350 sq. ft. coverage area; Remote control included; 2 year warranty. 4-way air directional louvers; Three (3) fan speeds; Four (4) operation modes. Compatible with the Koldfront wall air conditioner sleeve (WTCSLV) sold separately; to purchase with the sleeve see model WTC8001WKIT. Note: Heat function is only intended to provide supplemental heating in addition to an existing heat source.It was damaged some on delivery. Back left corner was smashed in where may have been dropped on that corner. The foam packaging was all broken up. It was just frame corner where no working parts are. We purchased the exterior sleeve and all installed ok with some struggle due to the denting. I like the whole package and kit. It runs good so far. Make sure to lay flat 24 hour before running it because oil in compressor needs to settle. It's not as loud as the unit this replaced. Any fan unit will make noise unless you want to sit on a block of ice to cool off this is best option. We installed it in our Sun room 300 square ft all glass windows and cools down fast. It's a good unit and best value for hard earned cash . . Tried the heat during morning coolness and it is really fast and quiet. The AC is louder than the heat feature but I set the fan speed to low and it's better. Both features work well and the entire package is professionally done.4/21/2019 Add, contacted the seller CompactAppliance about the damage on delivery and all they asked me to do is send them pictures then they discounted the product after they saw it. I also had home security camera video of the delivery. They were very fast to respond and appreciated me letting them know about the issue.4/12/2020 Unit works great, there is some noise from the adjustable front vent as it vibrates when running. I put a pad stuffed under the vent and it seems to have stopped the vibration noise. The maker should look at that and redesign that vent so it does not rattle or vibrate when it is running.Was a little worried about buying a TTW AC via Amazon, but the price was SOOO much better than the local big box stores we decided to give it a try. The unit arrived in about 4 days. It took my wife and I about 3 hours to figure out the best way to install the included foam seals in the existing sleeve to make this thing fit. Once we plugged it in it turned on and within 30 minutes our exercise room was cool again. Relatively simple to install. Very nicely priced. Simple to operate and it works well. What's not to like? My guess is the comments about it being noisy came from folks who didn't take full advantage of the styrofoam centering blocks and foam padding. I have no complaints.Installed this unit in just under 3 hours, including cutting the wall open. I used the insulation per the instructions and also used the noise damper blocks. I had 100% success with very little noise. Has heat and cool for year round use and really cools very well.Our guest house used to be heated/cooled by an ancient through-the-wall unit that sounded like a ghost rattling its chains. Well, the old unit finally packed it in and we replaced it with the Koldfront. My wife and I did the installation ourselves, something we approached with great trepidation since neither one of us is exactly carpenter material. Nevertheless, we were able to modify the existing opening, fit the sleeve (yes, don't forget this!) into the opening, secure it, slide the unit into the sleeve, and replace the existing decorative molding so everything still looked nice. Here's a plug for a different product: Great Stuff spray foam insulation by Dow. This stuff is unbelievable and will easily fill in the inevitable gaps. Highly recommended.The unit works great. The room is probably near the top end of the 350 sq. ft. max and the Koldfront has no problem heating/cooling. It is also way quieter than the previous unit, although that's not really saying much since you had to crank the TV volume up when the old unit came on. Still, it's reasonably quiet and we are very satisfied with out purchase.Several reviews have claimed this unit is too loud. To me it sounds the same as any thru-the-wall AC. Cools my 250 square foot cabin in the 120 degree heat of West Texas without any problem. Notice the fine print. This unit requires a cabinet for proper installation. That requirement is buried in the description and I could not find the cabinet on Amazon at the time I ordered. But overall, a solid value.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Monitor Design - Our Slim 1800R Curved FHD (1920 x 1080) display provides a immersive picture. Display Performance - A 165hz refresh rate and a 3ms response time will improve clarity on your picture during fast action scenes. AMD FreeSync Premium compatibility will make your picture even smoother.. Picture Quality - 95% sRGB Color Gamut and 16.7 Million Color Depth will show all of your content with clarity and color accuracy. Ports - 2 HDMI, 1 DP, and 3.5mm Audio In/Out allow you to connect whatever devices you needI've played with 60hz my entire life, this monitor is a beast and can definitely overclock to 185hz, only with DP connection to your system if it supports it. No dead pixel upon opening the box and as of roughly 2 weeks of ownership. I thought the color quality was poor at first, but there is a saturation configuration setting on the monitor itself, easy fix, bright and vibrant colors, and that's definitely something I need as a gamer who plays a lot of games for visuals. If you are a competitive, you're not gonna have to worry about your frame because I promise they will be through the roof. Overall, this monitor has allowed me to completely eliminate any mechanical problems slowing down my gameplay, and the only detriment whatsoever to your frames will be your wifi/internet connection strength. 10/10 would recommend this monitor to any gamer in need of a fun gaming experience!I received the monitor just fine, and it turns on. There are NO dead pixels, sweet!! I needed a 1080p panel because I was hooking my ps4 to it as well. The ps4 limit is 60hz and looks great, but if you have a gpu that has DP on it you will be in for a treat. I have tested all my games on this little gem and it does NOT disappoint! 185hz works, AMD freesync works, there is absolutely NO screen tearing no matter how hard I tried!!! I love the VA panel, and super high refresh rate!I never leave reviews. Like ever. But I figured I would on this product so people wouldn�t feel as insecure about buying this monitor as I did. First of all, if you use a display port, this thing will run at a BEAUTIFUL 185hz. I was coming from a 60hz monitor and man is this one absolutely insane compared to that one. 27� with the curve is a pretty good sweet spot in my opinion. The logo on the back glows which is something the last model did not include. Color is great, viewing angles are great, and it works with Gsync if you have an nvidia card like I do and you are wanting to use that feature. I turned the free sync on on the monitor and enabled Gsync in my nvidia settings and it worked flawlessly. Vsync turned off on all of my games and not a single tear. If your looking for a sub $300 monitor that will run at 185z, look no further. This thing rocks. 10/10 would recommend.So I saw other reviews on the exact issue I had. The monitor did not power on. I did some troubleshooting and the power supply was bad. So unless you spend the time trying to figure out this for yourself you would never know. PLEASE BE ADVISED BUYERS, THESE POWER SUPPLIES ARE NOT WORKING. The monitor itself is a excellent so SCEPTRE you owe me a power supply for my monitor. Cough up the 12V power supply so I can have my spare back! Read the reviews people. It makes a difference.As soon as it came in I plugged it in and it wouldn�t turn on it�s not the power cable because I refer it out it�s something in the monitor I would really appreciate if someone helped.Pro's:","Pro's:

First off the box it came in super cute! The. You pull this girl out the bag with NO SMELL! I was all ready to bleach the knot and pluck but wait there was no need.. who ever is the plucker of the hair line must be a PhD in it cause all I had to do was cut the lace got to be glued and no lie went out got up went to church shouted came home!! No shearing this is the best unit I have ever had and girls y�all know how much hair we go threw this is a staple wig!!!! Also I order 20� and when I took tape measure to it it was 23.5� they went off with that!!!I love this wig. I buy a lot of wigs/ bundles off amazon since I�m a prime member . I was a bit worried based off reviews but this is by far my favorite wig. It�s so natural . People think it�s my real hair. The texture is def like a relaxed African American feel. Nowhere near silky . In the pic I included I didn�t even flat iron or blow it. I let it air dry and it dries straight . It holds a curl good and when you flat iron it you can get a even more bone straight look. But I prefer for it to be textured . I got a 16 inch but it probably was closer to a 18 or 20 inch. It�s soft. I cut layers into it . I bleached the knots and cut baby hair but I didn�t pluck it, the pre plucked hairline comes really natural looking so it�s great if your lazy like me or just a beginner in wigs . I will say this is more on the small head friendly side but I have a small head so this is perfect for me . I love that it came with a edge control brush instead of those cheap ass lashes we usually get from other companies ?? and it came it 2 nude caps . Ordering off amazon was cheaper than they website for some reason ?? this wig is definitely a go . I don�t experience Shedding. I�ve had kinky straight hair before and I like this a lil more because I myself have relaxed hair . GET IT PERIOD POOHThis hair is very nice! I love it . It totally upgraded my appearance. Buy it Child just Buy it.I tinted the lace , the plucking was perfect. It�s smooth and I�ve had for 3 weeks. I�d definitely repurchase.nanThis wig is amaaaazing! I�ve had it for weeks, it had a little shedding when i unboxed but since then it hasn�t been an issue at all. Would buy from this seller againPro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanFirst impression out of the box with any Fairtex product is high quality and craftsmanship. The BGV9 exceeds this and then some before even slipping them on. I was in the market for a longer cuffed, 16oz glove primarily for bag and mitt/pad work, but able to use and not feel guilty doing drills and technical (light) sparring. I've owned a pair of the flagship BGV1, which are nice, but I didn't like the lack of a grip bar. The BGV9's have a grip bar and probably the most effective one I've tried in a glove of any brand. That said, I was surprised by the size of the hand compartment within the glove. Most all Thai branded gloves are damn near impossible to get a hand in, brand new and I have average size hands at 6' 1"" - 170lbs. These 16oz are caverns. More space from left and right of the hand than length-wise. In fact, they're about a perfect length for me. Making a fist inside feels good. I'm hoping as they break in, they'll conform more around my hand as time goes. We'll see. One thing I love about this glove compared to other Thai brands is the lack of loose fabric within. For regular sparring, I probably wouldn't use these because they are on the harder side. They feel great hitting the pads and bag. Padding on the palm is more than sufficient. Stitching is great and these should last for years with heavy use. Overall I'm pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend them to others.I've tried a good bit of gloves, these are THE best for pad, mitt, and bag work, period. Wrist support is top notch for hard punching, grab bar is great for power and feel, fit is snug and supportive, quality is what you'd expect from Fairtex, price is more than reasonable for handmade premium leather gloves. I walk around at 160-165 and use a 12oz pair of these for everything striking related except sparring.Only downside is the shape and design of these don't work great for MT clinches, which makes sense because they are a more traditional mexican-style boxing glove. If you are sparring in Muay Thai, I recommend the BGV1 for that, Fairtex's bread and butter MT glove. But for pad/bag work I LOVE these because of the additional wrist support.I have these (BGV9) in 12oz for pad/mitt/bag work and the BGV1 in 16oz for sparring. That glove quiver should handle anything you throw at it for several years, provided you take proper care of your gear. Use deodorizers after each session, don't leave your gloves in your bag wet, apply leather conditioner monthly to keep the surface soft and supple (any real leather gloves will crack if you don't do this, it's not a quality issue, it's a user issue).Lastly, there is no doubt these are REAL FAIRTEX GLOVES, but you can get fakes from weird third party sellers here on Amazon, so pay attention when you buy. Mine came in the factory plastic sealed with an authentic Fairtex tag on it. When you select your size/color, read carefully and only buy from ""Fairtex Official"" (fulfilled by Amazon). That guarantees you are buying products stocked directly from Fairtex to Amazon. Anyone else I wouldn't trust.I was excited to get my first pair of ""higher end"" gloves, but when I put them on they were insanely rough on my knuckles and loose... I don't have dainty little hands, I'm a 6' 215 lb man with an athletic build... these gloves are awful and to be honest a bit dangerous. If I were to put effort into my punches I could have injured my knuckles or my wrists. I wish I could give the crooks who sold this 0 stars... and punch them in the head with real Fairtex gloves.These are boxing gloves, not Muay Thai gloves. They are excellent quality. Be warned, they will feel quite stiff when you first use them. It may be a little tough to squeeze your hands through the wrist portion for a couple weeks. There may be some stiff and uncomfortable edges inside the glove. However, THEY DO BREAK IN after a few weeks. The gloves get more supple and comfortable. You won't notice those stiff spots on the inside anymore. Now they feel like a dream to wear. The gloves are very well made. The wrist support is fantastic so you can really wail away on that heavy bag.I have been wanting these gloves for a long time. I saw all the reviews and they just seemed amazing. I finally bought the gloves and have had them for about 2 months now. In the end I was impressed by some stuff, and disappointed by other stuff to a point where I am regretting buying these.To start off, the gloves looks great. They are made from really good quality materials. Real leather. They feel like tanks and will probably last you for a long time.They are also really stiff, and are great for the heavy bag. I would not use these for sparring much, unless you want to hurt the person across from you. In that case, get ready to lose a sparring partner. There is just no give on the foam.The biggest thing against these gloves is the comfort. I have 12 different boxing gloves and these are the most uncomfortable gloves by a mile. It's because of that second grip bar all the way in the glove by your finger tips. I have bigger thick hands, and every time it feels so uncomfortable and my fingers go numb if I use these gloves for a longer period of time. I really wish I could return these and buy something else. Be careful of that second grip bar. I see what they were trying to do, but there is a reason why most other gloves don't shove another grip bar by young finger tips.Still giving them 3 stars for being a good value for money glove with great quality and durability, but I can't give them more since they are not usable for me and are extremely uncomfortable.Pro's:","Pro's:

We will reply and offer you a satisfactory solution in 24 hours.The desk wasn�t exactly super easy to put together, had to put in some effort to make sure it was even and that all the screws got in, but with some patience me and my husband were able to do it. The desk is beautiful when put together, you can see a little on top where it�s not aligned completely with the two 10 pieces in the middle, but we were able to make it as straight as possible to be aesthetically pleasing enough.Perfect for two people who work from home and need a designated place to work and also study.It�s a good desk for the price! The box was heavy too.If this is your first desk, we recommend it.I was overall very pleased with this desk. We have had it for a few weeks now and it has held up nicely. Our two elementary aged kids use it for school as well as their arts and crafts. It is easy to clean and the storage is a nice touch. My reason for not rating higher is that it was a little challenging to assemble. Nothing that even a novice couldn't power through. Some of the bolts didn't quite line up. Each desk has it's own independent frame that branches off middle storage. We assembled on carpet, and so due to plushness of carpet it was challenge to get it level. I went back and forth loosening bolts and working to get it just right. Eventually it worked out, and I am happy with the end result.The desktop doesn�t line up correctly even doing a �star� pattern and trying to adjust. There�s still some overhang on the left side compared to the right.Quality of materials is subpar and I say this because the desk is not level. Where the two top pieces meet its bowed out.The cubby will not fit anything other than books or a very small pc build.Last thing, the �wood� looks constantly dirty even though I�m a clean freak and wipe down surfaces very frequently.Get a desk somewhere else. Not impressed with this desk in the slightest.Very good value for the money, well made, not flimsy.I only gave it 4 stars because two of the captured nylon nuts in the top did not line up with the support holes so I was not able to use them. If I had taken more time to loosen up other bolts and move them around then they might fit. They were not needed for the final assembly.This is the kind of desk I've been looking for! I like space and this desk gives it to me! I can put my printer on one desk, and put my computer on the other and everything else in between! I even have room to write! It's constructed well with metal legs and very sturdy! It is a great value because you basically get two desk for the price of one!

I absolutely love the texture gray and black look. I was searching for a medium size laptop friendly tote that had pockets and zippers for protection. This lovely bag exceeded my expectations, because let's face it, pictures and descriptions can only go so far - you have to see it for yourself! The quality is excellent and the lay out of the bag pockets and zippered sections makes it very roomy and accessible, but not too big! The small, deep pocket on the outside is perfect to drop your phone in for easy reach and the entire bag zips close. It even stands up on it's own when filled - a big deal for me because I don't like bags that collapse all over the floor and ooze contents!!! This is a great find; highly recommended!I love this bag!

I've been using it for about a month now and have taken it on four flights for business trips, and it's holding up beautifully. I didn't realize that it was a plastic-y waterproof material when I bought it, but I'm glad it is - I've had to run through the rain with it a few times already and it helped to know my laptop and peripherals and notebooks would stay dry.My bag arrived in 2 days, and I used it immediately. It holds not only my laptop, but just about anything else I need to take with me. The straps make it easy to carry as a shoulder bag. It has several pockets and the laptop compartment has velcroed flap to ensure my laptop doesn't fall out if the bag is accidentally tipped upside-down, in addition to the fact that the top zipper closes the whole bag, so other items don't fall out. The outside pocket is easily accessible to make smaller items (phone and pens) easily accessible. I'll get lots of use out of this bag!Pro's:","Pro's:

Protective Packaging: Americanflat developed exclusive proprietary packaging that helps ensure safe delivery of fragile items; order with confidence, click and add to cart todayStated size is FALSE. Viewable size for image is 12.5 x 18.5 and entire frame is 14.25 x 20.25. You CAN fit a 13 x 19 image into this frame, however you will lose an entire half inch both vertically and horizontally, so this is completely worthless if your image doesn't have any border or you don't mind losing a full inch of your image (measuring diagonally).I get it, lots of frames advertise being slightly larger than they are. I'm an artist, I'm used to that and understand that they usually are saying what size image will fit, not the viewable size. However, I bought this particular frame SPECIFICALLY because one of the images literally shows the measurement of the viewable area as 13 x 19. The image showing this false measurement needs to be edited to show the accurate size.I was hesitant purchasing this particular frame seeing as some other reviews showed their product arrived cracked, but other alternatives were out of the question for their prices so I stuck to my guns with this one. Glad I did!The cardboard backing is easy to remove, and it fit perfectly for my 11x17 art print I measured prior. Doesn't shake around in the frame like I feared. I had this print signed, and it protects it quite well! No visible scratches on the glass. If I buy another one of these frames for other prints, hopefully I have a similar experience.I was searching for a frame on Amazon and came across this frame. It came wrapped up with enough protection.The glass on the frame was a little dirty but that was easily fixed by cleaning it. Besides that there isn't really anything to complain about. The frame arrived in good condition and was shipped fast.I ordered a poster from Vista print and it looks great in this frame it was a perfect fit. I am very happy with my purchase. I will consider this brand in the future when I need order another.Absolutely stunning & very well made! It exceeded my expectations & was even nicer in person than in the picture! It includes both hangers already attached to hang either vertically or horizontally plus the option of wire as well. It's got a nice heft & is definitely much nicer looking than the price alludes to. I'm very impressed. My only qualm, if I had to nitpick, are those little metal tabs that secure the backing. I have found in past experiences that after bending them back & forth a few times, it can cause them to break which will lead to the back needing to be taped as an alternative. While I don't anticipate this to happen to me due to the nature of the use of the frame, it is something to be kept in mind if you frequently change what you display. Otherwise, it's sincerely a terrific, quality frame that is well packaged at an unbeatable price.I could not be more pleased with this frame. I had a matted print I needed to frame, and the outside dimensions of the mat were exactly 11 x 17. It can of course be tricky to order online and be sure you're getting the right size, but I relied on the seller's description as well as the seller's answers to some customer questions. It's exactly what I wanted. Frame itself is very sleek and elegant-looking. The glass is much thicker than you often find in pre-made frames, especially at this price point! The backing board is sturdy, and it will hold quite well the sawtooth hanging bracket. There are actually two brackets, to hang vertically or horizontally, and I like that they are mounted on the board, not on the edge of the frame. They also will bend outward to give a little more space between the picture nail and the frame. The frame also comes with alternate hanging hardware -- clips and wire if you prefer that way. And the protective packaging was great, very carefully designed. Everything about this frame was high-quality.Pro's:","Pro's:

KETO-FRIENDLY - this protein powder can help support your ketogenic macros. Gluten and Lactose FreeI am a middle aged woman needing to lose weight. I am allergic to nuts. I did my research and tried this product. I mix it with coconut milk and 1/2 banana every morning. I have lost 26 pounds in 10 weeks. This keeps my energy and nutrient levels up and makes it easy to a tay on target. I tried the creamy vanilla and didn't care for it. The Dutch chocolate does the trick and I am not tired of it. This is the choice to make!I ordered strawberries and cream previously and I like it. This time I ordered Dutch Chocolate. As I am assuming several here are, I am on the ketogenic diet. This means carb usage is at a premium. When I looked at the advertised nutritional content, it said 1 carb, and then 1 fiber, which is really 0 carbs as the fiber cancels it out.However, when I got the container, it does NOT match what was advertised. It shows each serving as 3 carbs with 1 fiber; a net of 2 carbs. This is not extreme, but still does not match what is advertised.Absolutely LOVE this product!! I am a 22 year old woman and I�ve been training for 8 months now and have tried a variety of whey protein products and have found that this is by far my favorite. I�ve been using this product for about a month now and definitely see and feel a difference and changes in my body type- I am gradually becoming more lean. It not only TASTES AMAZING but provides so many nutrients and replenishes those stores in the body. I use a bottle blender to shake it up. Very smooth (mixes very well) and tastes like Swiss Miss brand hot chocolate. I prefer mixing it with hot water. It definitely helps with muscle recovery while keeping me lean. DEFINITELY WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN!! I will say that this product is most effective AFTER exercise (or before as well but better to have some form of carbs before exercise so you can get the most out of your workout. Carbs=energy) and with clean-ish diet. (as any product is). Be patient, work hard, and you will see results!First, let me say that there are reviews here for various flavors, and I have only tried the chocolate. I was looking for a plant based protein powder, and I like Isopure products, so am trying it. According to what I see, it actually has more BCCAs than the Isopure Whey, though I do not know the specific break down of the various amino acids.I have used it in a blender and in a shaker, and both worked well. I usually add a little water or almond milk, then the powder, then more liquid, and i have no problems with clumping.The taste is good to me, and i have blended it alone, with iced coffee, with bananas and blueberries, and with strawberries. I guess I'm just not picky.It is manufactured in Illinois farm country, though I am not sure the peas and rice are grown here.How it works in the body vs something else...How in the world would I ever know? It says it's vegan pea and brown rice protein, which should be complete, so...Thanks for letting me share my thoughts.I�ve already had protein shakes from a favorite place I love ordering from so I was shocked that this plant protein had the same taste and texture! I was looking for protein powder to drink with since I just started exercising and I�d love to get more protein intake.It�s meant to be made with shakes and more. Stirring it with milk or anything else will make it not fully mixed. I definitely recommend! Love the taste, the chocolate is there and the one pound is a lot!Pro's:","Pro's:

We do it because it�s the only way we know how to deliver on our promiseI just learned that GOL is now owned by Nestle and that tests of the product have shown the presence of toxic metals and pesticides. I wish I had known that before wasting my money on this.The reason for this review is the new packaging.The new packaging says ""new and improved with 30% more protein"". But when I compared the nutrition information with the old packaging, this is what I saw:Old packaging \ new packagingTotal weight: 622 g \ 568 gProtein per serving: 17g \ 22gServing size 1 scoop: 22g \ 28gServing size per container: 28 \ 20Price: $28.21 \ $31.68 (Jan 2016 \ July 2016)I am giving 4 stars because I don't have any complaints about the powder quality. But trust is an extremely important factor for something that goes into my body. The claims in the new packaging makes me question that. The new bottle is taller than the older one, but it is only half full. Scoop is bigger as well. New packaging has less powder for higher price. New one has some extra ingredients though.Ingredients (Old):a. Organic raw sprout blend:Organic sprouted brown rice protein, organic amaranth sprout, organic quinoa sprout, organic millet sprout, organic buckwheat sprout, organic garbanzo bean sprout, organic lentil sprout, organic adzuki bean sprout, organic flax seed sprout, organic sun flower seed sprout, organic pumpkin seed sprout, organic chia seed sprout, organic sesame seed sproutb. Raw probiotic & enzyme blend:High protein chlorella, proteases, bacillus subtilisc. Mixed tocopherols:Alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocotrienol, gamma-tocotrienol, delta-tocotrienol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherolIngredients (New):a. Organic raw sprout blend:Same as old + organic pea protein, organic cracked wall chlorella, organic guar gum, organic carob bean gumb. Raw probiotic & enzyme blend:Lipase, aspergillopepsin, beta-glucanase, cellulase, bromelain, phytase, lactase, papain, peptidase, pectinase, hemicellulase, xylanase, lactobasyllus acidophilus, lactobasyllus plantarum, lactobasyllus bulgaricusOk, steer away from this new version!! I've been using the old version for around 3-4 years and it was awesome. This new one is absolutely horrible ... the new creamy version they tout is more like sludge in your cup and the taste it not good ...! Did they even taste this to the public before they decided to change the whole formulate on their own. NEVER buying again. Why did you screw up a good thing??? should have kept it the same.I have been an Amazon.com customer for over 13 years. I have never written a review, until now. I am so disgusted with Garden of Life and their ""updated"" product. It comes in a larger tub. It has a larger scoop. There is bold print everywhere on how it has 22 grams of protein per serving. Yet when I stopped to analyze their newest iteration of their protein product, I realized I am getting MUCH LESS. The tub, although being much larger than the previous version comes brand new, HALF EMPTY.The NEW and IMPROVED version has only 20 SERVINGS total per tub. The old had about a months supply - 28 servings.So to break it down New vs Old:New tub = 568g of total product; 28g serving size; 22g protein (78% protein)Old tub = 622g of total product; 22g serving size; 17g protein (77% protein)In reality we are ending up with just a very slight increase in the amount of protein per scoop, yet 8 servings less and in that ridiculous LARGER tub.The new tub is LARGER in size yet contains LESS. That was just wasteful, possibly designed to deceive the consumer - all from a company that states it wants to do the best for the world. How about start by being honest and simply maintain what you had going while improving the contents. If you reduce the amount of product - then REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE TUB!Lastly, regarding the servings. 28 servings in the old tub and 20 in the new. I will have to purchase the NEW product over 18 times in one year period if I'm taking one serving per day. The old tub would have to be bought about 13 times.I am a college student without much extra money who tries to eat healthy. I always sit in the front of the class and even if I'm not the brightest student I do know that money doesn't grow on trees. I have learned however after this product, money is growing VERY well in the Garden of Life.I have purchased this over and over again, over the course of maybe 2 to 3 years now. Having a short background in nutrition makes me analytical and skeptical of so many products � but this one holds up in theory and in my stomach. This is the only protein powder that does not upset my stomach, and that, from a scientific and nutritional point of view, actually delivers nutrients and amino acids to the body without harmful byproducts, such as those that can be found in cesian or whey blends, like casonorphines. As someone who struggles greatly with stomach issues as well as a skiNone foundcne concerns, I need to be very peculiar about what I put in my body. Seeing that it is vegan and organic is a huge bonus, and seeing that it is raw helps me agree with the idea that the proteins are not denatured or broken down.I always buy the unsweetened one, as some of the sweetened flavors have Stevia which does not always sit well with me.As mentioned, very sensitive individual here. The unsweetened is the best, I can put it into smoothies, sometimes I start a half of a scoop into a soup I am making, and although I don�t do this often, if I am making sweets or muffins I can throw a scoop in. I really love how versatile and nutritionally backed it is.I have never written an Amazon review before, but this product deserves it.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Includes 1 (1.25 pound) Orgain simple organic peanut butter plant protein powder. 20 grams of organic plant-based protein made from just a handful of high-quality ingredients. Made from nuts & seeds: almonds, peanuts, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, golden peas. No stevia.. USDA organic, certified vegan, dairy, gluten, soy & lactose free, non-GMO, kosher. Mix with water, milk, or into your favorite shake recipe for a quick breakfast or snack drink. Great for meal replacement, as smoothie boosters, and building lean muscle.I have been looking for a shake similar to neolife with a little bit of sugar, I can't stand the zero calorie sweeteners and get hypoglycemic when I don't have any sugar in a shake. 6g is just perfect to balance my blood sugar but still low calorie. I love that they engineered a new product and I'm obsessed! More flavors please! I have peanut butter and vanilla and both taste greatI read several reviews before buying this vegan protein powder so I wanted to offer my own personal view of this powder. I would not classify this as a ""protein powder"" in the normal sense of the word. It is made with nuts and pea protein. It is not only SLIGHTLY nutty in flavor, nuts are all you can taste in this powder. So, if you are making a fruit smoothie, it will taste very nutty, which in my opinion, is not a favorable taste. If you are making a chocolate smoothie it might be better. I would not recommend making a vanilla smoothie OR a fruit smoothie with this powder. It is NOT gritty it's just that, personally speaking, the taste of this powder just did not appeal to me. I am going back to Shakeology even though it'll put you in the poor house. You just can't beat their vegan vanilla Shakeology.YUM. I have never liked a protein powder as much as I like this! I used to buy original Orgain, but the stevia turned me off. This mix is very sweet if you add it to sweetened nut milk, but actually is great with just water. It�s nutty and super chocolatey. Highly recommend!I'm puzzled, given all the high reviews, and wonder if I may have somehow gotten a bad batch, but what I got I can barely swallow. I tried it 3 times-- with coconut milk, almond milk, and cashew milk (all unsweetened). Each time I took one drink and dumped the remainder. It is really sickly sweet. I can't make sense of it since it is lower sugar/carbs and doesn't seem to have other sweeteners. I can't do whey, need low(ish) carb options but can't tolerate the taste of stevia, so my options are limited. I had high hopes for this one--- but it is a no for me. My ""winners"" have been Nutiva Organic Plant Protein Superfood Smoothie, Vega Protein Made Simple, and Spiru-tein Simply Natural.Good flavour and not gritty! No fake sugars or stevia, which is a definite plus.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: ORGANIC PLANT-BASED PROTEIN � Purely Inspired Organic Protein Powder delivers 22 grams of plant-based protein. TASTES GREAT and MIXES EASILY � Mix in a glass or shaker bottle with water, smoothies, almond milk, oat milk or your non-dairy drink of choice. Protein powder can also be added to oatmeal, snack bars, pancakes, waffles and other recipes. USE IN THE MORNING, BETWEEN MEALS, BEFORE or AFTER EXERCISE � Clean source of protein for women and men. CONVENIENT, SUPERIOR FORMULA � It�s an opportune way to add plant-based protein (organic pea and brown rice) and a probiotic with a great-tasting fruit and veggie blend. CLEAN INGREDIENTS � Certified USDA Organic, Gluten Free, Non-GMO, Vegan Friendly, Dairy Free, Soy Free, Cholesterol Free. No artificial sweeteners, colors or flavorsThe label on this package says, ""vegan friendly"". This is NOT vegan friendly. I have an actual picture of the ingredients attached to my review. It says this product contains milk ingredients. This is NOT vegan. My family and I get sick from dairy because we are not use to it and now I am sick to my stomach because I trusted the ""vegan friendly"" label. I can't imagine if someone had an actual allergy to milk and trusted the label.My doctor wanted me to get away from eating so many carbs for breakfast (I�m a cereal everyday kind of girl). I also work out nearly everyday, so I�m in need of fuel, and a Flight Attendant, so I�m in need of quick and easy. This product delivers all of the above. I�ve been using it as a breakfast meal replacement and I�ve been impressed by how long it actually holds me over. When I�m flying I pack enough powder for my trip and my blender cup, and can sip it while I get ready for work. At home I sit and enjoy it with my coffee, then work out. Convenience wise, this stuff is awesome! I do add a little cinnamon to it for extra flavor. On a side note: I do have to continue to shake the blender bottle in between sips due to settlement on the bottom.Taste: my first purchase was the vanilla and it�s good! It�s not the most amazing thing I�ve had in my life, but it�s not bad at all. Besides cinnamon I only add water. It�s creamy and not gritty. I love that it has loads of protein in it too. It�s very comparable to Shakeology (I think it may have more protein and less carbs than shakeology). I love Shakeology, but not the price. For a month, they�re wanting $130. Sorry, but it�s not worth paying that much for essentially the same product. I will be buying this product again, next time I�m going to try the chocolate. I do wish they had more flavors though!I originally bought his because it was suppose to be dairy and soy free which it apparently is not. I will not buy this again.I've used this protein powder for years and I like it because it doesn't congest the system like many whey proteins do. It's also naturally sweetened, no maltitol or other artificial sweeteners. I blend it with frozen berries, coconut milk and water (sometime through in a little yogurt) and it tastes great. I use it for part of my breakfast a few times a week, along with a small bowl of quinoa, maple syrup and walnuts. If you just want to drink it with water you're going to have to gulp it down, but a few very small healthy additions makes it great. As the author of a book on nutrition and weight loss, I highly recommend this product!!If you are vegan and you enjoy adding plant based protein powder to your diet, do not be fooled by this product (like I was). I thought I looked at it carefully, but alas, I didn't see the small, small print. This product uses deceptive advertising by calling it ""plant-based NUTRITION"" instead of plant based PROTEIN"". It is meant to deceive you. Why does that matter? Because it contains milk product!! But it doesn't specify what that milk product is even. This could be really bad if you're allergic to dairy. And it doesn't state it on front of container. It's meant to look like Orgain brand. Don't buy if you're vegan.Pro's:","Pro's:

File drawer opens on full-extension ball bearing slides and accepts legal and letter size documents. Hutch attaches to the desktop and features 2 frosted glass doors for concealed storage.

A few small marks, but nothing that is showing and not bad, especially for everything we ordered. Was packaged well, but I'm sure the small marks came from delivery.

It�s great- but doesn�t work for me- please check actual measurements before ordering.I have been trying to find a filter that fully fits a honeywell 20x25x4 media air filter. these are so under size that I am going to have to put a 1"" filter in the housing with it.Not entirely sure that I got what I ordered. The box that they arrived in says that it is, but the filters themselves are not marked. The filters are also not quite 4"" thick. When I pulled out my previous filter, you could see the difference in thickness. It also went into the unit more loosely than the previous filters I have used. The previous filters all fit snugly in the unit.My error: in a rush to replace my Honeywell filter, I failed to follow the seller's advice; 'Measure first'. These are not direct replacements. I needed an additional 1"" filter and the perimeter measurements are also off, but not enough to pack-n-ship. My error - my lunch.JimThese are great, even though the label states 20x25x4, I had to return the 3M products because they were to BIG and didn't fit in my air handler. These are the correct size and fit. Those people who are complaining that these are to small for theirs need to read the actual dimensions and measure their slot. I did not give the 3M product a poor rating because I failed to measure first and those giving this great product a poor rating because they didn't measure first is not right. These last about 3 months in my 5ton unit. I hear people mentioning the strain on the fan motor using a higher MERV, seriously? Sounds like the HVAC guy trying to sell me an overpriced lower MERV cheaper generic brand that he/she makes a good size profit.

Ideal for use with acrylic, oil, watercolor, gouache, tempura, pouring paint, airbrush paint, and other wet or dry painting media.. 100% Cotton Canvases: Pure cotton canvases with medium grain, so they hold the paint well without absorbing it and keep their natural tone and glossiness..

Multi-Use: Ideal ready-to-paint canvases for art studios, art students, class projects, events, painting parties, birthday parties, or anyone that enjoys creating pieces of art. Used and loved by aspiring artists, art students, and professional artists!I purchased these canvases in order to avoid going out in the middle of a pandemic and was excited to receive them, when they arrived, all three canvases were stuck together as if they were glued (they were probably packed together before the gesso completely dried). after managing to separate them, there were damages and rips to the front portion of the canvas because of them being stuck together. See images attached. buy at blick, Michaels, wherever else, I will be contacting the seller to receive a refund because this is really not worth it.Good quality for the price. Now my go to canvas.Do not buy these if you pour paint!!!! I'm warning you! They are flimsy as hell I regret getting them so bad! They may be ok if your just doing traditional painting but DO NOT GET THESE FOR POUR PAINTING!!!!! These are the WORST canvases I've ever used. I have one left and I literally will not touch it. The second one I used I had to cut up a box and place it as support behind the canvas to try and keep it from bending and wobbling after applying the pour paint which then requires me to tilt the canvas in different positions. The first canvas I used is trash because I was caught by surprise by the flimsiness.Its adequate.Awesome quality, and a great price!

(Performance results may vary based on host device, file attributes and other factors). Compatible with all Vantrue dashcams and most of the dashcams in the market.

The Vantrue High Endurance Video Card is able to withstand extreme temperatures, magnet, water and x-rays. Works perfectly in environments ranging from 32??158?, storage temperature of -13? to 185?.. Free SD Adapter included in the package, easy for video transferring.I bought this micro SD card with a Vantrue N4 dash cam because the description recommends this one and said not to use a sandisk or transcend card. I ended up having to purchase two of these cards because the first one was lost in shipping. When one did come, it failed to format in the dash cam and a computer wouldn�t even recognize the card. After attempting to format it in the dash cam, I took the card out and it was ridiculously hot for being used for only about 30 seconds. I also tried plugging the dash cam into a wall outlet with the card in it and it would glitch out and turn on and off repeatedly in 2-3 second intervals. It would record in black & white, flip the camera, the screen would blink rapidly, etc.I contacted customer service about all of these issues and left my number for a phone call that was promised within 24 hours. They never called, one person emailed me later and told me that I needed to update my dash cam to format my micro SD card. However the only way to actually update your dash cam is to do so with a micro SD card that is ALREADY formatted and working properly. Plus my dash cam�s firmware did not need to be updated as it was brand new. Customer service had no response for the lost card and hasn�t issued a refund for either one yet.I returned this card and purchased a sandisk ultra card for much cheaper at target. I found that sandisk resolved their micro SD card issues in dash cams over 2 years ago. As long as you buy a newer one that has �A1� stamped on it. It works flawlessly, I can view and save the videos on my computer or dash cam and none of the previous problems have occurred since.I own a ton of sandisk micro sd cards for use in my drone, gopro, etc. I specifically purchased this one as it was noted in the description of the dashcam I was purchasing (Vantrue N2 Pro) that sandisk cards would not work properly and that the vantrue card was recommended. I purchase both, put the vantrue card into my dashcam and was immediately greeted with an sd card error telling me to format. No problem.. go to format the card and then was greeted with yet another error message saying that the card could not be formatted and I should be using a class 10 card, which the vantrue sd card is.. I try a few more times to no avail, so I finally say screw it.. i'll take the vantrue card out and try one of my sandisk cards. I go to take the card out and I noticed that the area of the dashcam by the SD card was quite warm. I take the card out and immediately have to drop it on the floor as it was incredibly hot to the touch. If you were to pinch the card in between two fingers I have no doubt it would have caused a minor burn. So anyway.. I try one of my sandisk cards, the ones that aren't supposed to work, and low and behold they work fine. Save your money on this trash and buy an actual quality card from sandisk, lexar or samsungApril 2022. Updating my review. In October 2021 I gave this 2 stars (see below). Cathy in Vantrue customer service took care of my problems and replaced the entire dash cam unit. That resolved all my issues. Since January 2022 it has been working flawlessly - thus the 5 star rating now. The problems I was experiencing apparently were with the dash cam and not the SD card. Just a note - I have not been paid to give a good review. When the time comes to replace components, I will purchase from Vantrue again. And I hope Cathy will still be there if I need her.October 2021. Purchased with my Vantrue dash cam in September 2019. Because of the pandemic, I ended up not driving much and by extension didn't have much demand for the dash cam. Recently needed to pull a video of an accident I witnessed and the video would not come up. All I got was an error message to reformat the disk. Worked on it for a couple hours and I could not successfully reformat the disk. 256 GB for $50. Useful size at expensive price. But unreliable. I'd hate to count on it to back me up in an accident or prove my innocence in a traffic stop. Maybe the disk is damaged; excessive heat can do that. But no warning. Plus, I found the manual says to reformat the disk every two weeks. That's ridiculous and unrealistic. None of my other devices require that. I may not invest in another micro disk and just use this as a lesson not to be repeated. I feel I'm being generous giving the product 2 stars.I initially bought this card for a Vantrue 4K dash cam. I sold the camera and replaced it with a BlackVue DR900S with front and rear camera. I transferred this card into the BlackVue, formatted it and it has run solid ever since. I'm running both cameras at their highest resolution (4K front, 1080P rear) and have had no issues with heat or read/write speeds. This is a good, reliable card at a reasonable price. I highly recommend it for 4K dash cams and similar applications.Don't mess around pinching pennies. Get the card the manufacturer designed specifically for the dashcam. I feel confident in purchasing Vantrue products. I have tested the card in my computer and it recognized. If you pay attention to the ""other brands"" their warranties don't cover use in dashcams and I am betting your dashcam won't be as forgiving either. I pleased with the quality and presentation of every Vantrue product I have puchased including this micro SD card. I have had pleasant experiences and communication with Vantrue's customer service asking questions. I am very confident they would resolve any issues arising from a faulty product. Most negative reviews I have seen are what I would deem as issues of consumers trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Buy from Vantrue with CONFIDENCE!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 30-pints ENERGY STAR. Applicable area: 200 to 250 sq. ft.Summary: Works very well in a challenging 150 sq ft room, suggesting it can easily handle the room sizes recommend. No noisier than it needs to be. Seems thoughtfully designed and well built, so far.I bought this unit to dehumidify a library, but until electricians could correct a wiring error there, I put the unit to work drying out my 72-sq-ft walk-in closet about one-third full of clothes. The unit loafed, running rarely, but when it ran, even on the lower fan speed, I could barely hear it through the wall in the adjoining bedroom. (I live in a very quiet rural area. Urban and most suburban residents wouldn't hear this.) I learned that a smaller, and hopefully just a bit quieter, dehumidifier would be good for the closet.Later I moved this unit to the library: 150 square feet, with one double door usually closed, a high cathedral ceiling (this probably doesn't matter), and about 3000 lb of books, which matters a lot! In most rooms, the walls and furnishings hold more water than the air, but this library is extreme. Lowering the relative humidity from 65% to 55% in the room, the air would yield about two ounces of water, while the books would yield 25 pounds of water! This unit works just fine. Set at 55, it comes on at 60 and shuts off at 54, on the dial of the built-in humidistat.It cycles several times an hour now, and will do so until the excess moisture in the books slowly diffuses into the air and then out the water collection tank. Until then, I need to empty it every couple of days, but ultimately, once a week should be enough. The unit can fit a drain hose, but that doesn't work fo me. The water tank has a fold-up handle, and a full tank is easy to manage.I could extract water from the books faster on the Continuous setting, where the unit shuts off only when the tank is full, but I choose not to, because humidity in the air would plunge, causing two issues. First, the lower the water content in the air, the less efficiently the unit runs. Second, excessively low humidity, over a week or two, could damage my wood floor, which is acclimated to about 65% humidity, and is now being asked to tolerate 55%.The unit uses about 43 watts, fan only, on regular (low) speed, and 55 watts on turbo (high) speed. But when the compressor runs, the total usage is close to 300 watts on either fan speed, in my experience. The unit extracts water faster on turbo. So on turbo, I get lower electrical cost and lighter duty cycle, which should lengthen the lifetime of the unit. So the only reason to avoid turbo is the noise level, bothersome during the day, while regular speed is mostly ok during the day.The unit takes air in at the back and discharges it left and slightly down. I try to place the unit where this air can circulate around the room, before it inevitably rises, being dryer and warmer. One possible issue here is a warm dry draft over the top of a section of wood plank flooring, perhaps drying it out over time. I might put a sheet of plastic down to prevent that.The unit's fan continues to run about three minutes after the compressor stops, giving time to dry the evaporator coils and let the unit approach air temperature, before shutting off.I'll raise the rating to five stars after the unit is free of trouble for five years. I am monitoring electrical consumption. It's now about 4 kW-hr/day and dropping. I'm hope for less than 1 kW-hr/day once the books are dry. I'll report back in a few weeks.Recently purchased the unit and it stopped working after 1 month. The fan runs, and I can hear the compressor, but the humidity levels don't drop and no moisture is collected in the bucket. I live in Houston so we have plenty of humidity. I called SPT and they offered to repair under warranty but I have to ship the unit back at my cost ($40+), they don't work with any local appliance shops. I don't have time to deal with shipping the unit back so it's going in the trash. I don't recommend this unit and will not be buying SPT brand appliances again.Comes in handy when you have several leaks in your home that you didn't know about.nannanPro's:","Pro's:

Capacity to Live Large: With massive amounts of storage, 512GB is enough for 24 hours of 4K UHD video, 78 hours of Full HD video, 150,300 photos, or 77,300 songsThe genuine Samsung Evo Select line of Micro SD cards are great. They are reliable and they live up to the speed and capacity classifications they claim to. I've been using Samsung cards for years and they are the only brand that consistently doesn't give me any issues year after year.This 32GB card is no exception. However, by default the card is formatted as FAT32, but I prefer exFAT as FAT32 won't allow you to transfer a folder containing more than 4GB to the card. That's annoying if you are moving data from an old card to a new one. FAT32 has 4GB file size limitations, but on a transfer it recognizes a directory containing lots of files as 1 thing, and applies the 4GB limit. This will give you an error (in Windows anyway) that there isn't enough space available for the transfer. But if you copy the files individually it works fine. Or just format the card to exFAT and it will accept the folder that exceeds 4GB easily. exFAT will work just fine in an Android phone as well (Android 5.1 or higher. Earlier versions may have some issues with the exFAT formatting)This card handles full HD Video at 60FPS without faulting. It's write speeds are fine to use for HD video.But be sure to authenticate the card upon arrival to make sure it's a genuine Samsung card with the stated capacity. Micro SD cards are a favorite thing for fraudsters to counterfeit because it's cheap and easy to do it. In the past the regular Evo line of Samsung cards (the white and orange colored ones) where the popular cards to counterfeit. Though with these higher grade cards (Evo Select line with the white and green color scheme) starting to be more popular......well it behooves anyone buying a new SD card to check it's authenticity upon arrival. The 2 tone fade of the green coloring adds an additional anti-counterfeiting measure over the previous solid colors. This makes it more expensive to counterfeit a Samsung card convincingly.What happens is that fraudulent card makers will take a 4GB Class 1 card that costs $1 to make, and hack the control chip that tells the computer what the capacity of the card is so your computer thinks it's a much larger card. Your computer will even try to write well over 4GB of data, but the data doesn't actually go anywhere. It's the same idea as putting a 100 gallon label on a 10 gallon bucket. You can pour 100 gallons into it, but 90 of those gallons are just going to flow out over the top and be lost forever.Below are some steps to help you ensure that you get a legitimate Samsung card.? For the last several years Samsung has made it's micro SD cards with white plastic. That means the actual card itself behind the colorful label on front is white. You can see the white plastic on the sides. Fake cards are almost always all black, because they are generically produced low cost cards that are given a fancy Samsung looking label on the front. If the card you get it black ON THE SIDES, it's not a Samsung. White plastic is more expensive to make, and fraudsters are all about doing it cheap. (See my images below of a real Samsung card with the white sides and back showing) The back should be black. The sides should be white. And the front should be colorful with the 2 tone green fade.? Buy only from reputable vendors. Amazon is a reliable vendor. And if there is a problem, they will take it back without hassle. There are dozens of other 3rd party vendors who are just as trustworthy. But make sure you are buying from one of those. Read their seller feedback. If there are numerous complaints from people who bought fake capacity cards or even cards that didn't work properly, find a different seller.? Make sure the listing looks right. This one is fine. It's a legitimate Samsung card. (I've personally bought it and tested it) But scammers will post nearly identical looking listings on Amazon that have cards that look nearly identical buy don't have the Samsung logo at the top. (Recently another scammer replaced Samsung with Sanshen on fake cards. Other than that they were identical. They used the same font any everything, including the A in Samsung that doesn't have the bar in the middle)? Be careful of the price. If the price of the card you are looking at is significantly below the price of other listings for similar capacity cards, something is wrong. One of the biggest tricks scammers play is to make the price WAY lower than it should be in hopes of getting you to spend more time looking at the price tag than looking at the other things that don't add up right on the listing. Unusually low priced flash storage almost never works out well.? Test the card once you buy it! Regardless of who you buy your Micro SD card from or what brand it is, test it out. A thorough way to test it is with a utility app called ""h2testw"". You can download it free. Just do a search for it on any search engine and you'll find it. That app writes single bit data to the drive until it's full, then it reads that data back to make sure it's readable. It will tell you what the actual capacity of this disk is. The default language on that utility is German, but you can switch to English easily. It is not fast. It will take about 45 minutes to test a 32GB card, and several hours to test a 256GB card. Just run it overnight and check the results in the morning. This is smart to do even if you have no doubts that you have an authentic Samsung (or other brand name) product. Sometimes things go wrong in manufacturing and quality control and a dud gets through. An app like h2testw will verify that your legitimate brand name card is working properly. And if it's not, you'll know right away while you are still in your 30 day exchange window.Another user review points out that their 128GB Samsung EVO Select card is only rated for 60MB/s write speeds.If you look under the ""From the manufacturer"" part of the product description with the 64GB version of the card selected you will see that it states that it is rated for write speeds up to 20MB/s.The 128GB shows write speeds of up to 60MB/s.And both the 256GB and 512GB versions show write speeds of up to 90MB/s. All of the cards have a read speed of up to 100MB/s.Just wanted to point this out for clarification. I am not a fan of the way Amazon groups the reviews of multiple versions of the same product into one big confusing mess but it's the world we live in I guess.All in all it's a great card and exactly what I expected!You should be very careful when buying SD cards online. One way I knew this listing was legitimate was by checking the merchant during order review, mine showed as ""Amazon.com Services LLC"".Upon arrival I checked the packaging which had no misprints, and the micro SD card graphics were crisp and had white sides, the model number on the packaging also matched the model written on the card's backside, all pointing to a legitimate item.Last test was speed and storage test, everything checked out in terms of storage but my speeds were a little slower but I am attributing this to my very old laptop.Writing speed: 65.8 MByte/sReading speed: 71.7 MByte/sYou can trust this listing, as long as the seller shows up as ""Amazon.com Services LLC""This micro SD card is probably one of the best you can get for the price and is definitely worth it. I use this card for my switch bought a ton of games and still have about half the space left it's way more than enough. It also the has the same read/write speed as the Sandisk Nintendo branded micro SD cards and those cards cost $60 more ($130) for the same 512gb card. Overall this is one of the better deals right now for micro SD cards and you should definitely think about investing in this card.Note: I noticed there were many other reviewers saying that these cards didn't come with the correct amount of storage so I thought I might let everyone know what the high capacity cards actually let you use:128gb=116gb-119gb useable256gb=238gb useable512gb= 476gb useableFirst time I bought this, it got corrupted within a year. I am a normal user of the phone and do not fool around with the sd card. I just let it sit in my phone, and never take it out. Left with no choice (since my internal is only 32GB- Samsung S7 Edge) I reordered this. It has got corrupted again, this time after working for only 8 months (Bought November 2017, corrupted June 2018). What am I supposed to do? How do I get in touch with Samsung support?Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: DaToo AQUARIUM FILTER: How to create a clean and healthy environment for our beloved fish? This is a concern for everyone who likes fish farming. But DaToo filter help you easily implement it. Strong horse-power, Waterfall type water flow, perfect work in 24 hours ensures a clean and healthy water environment. Now follow me to get to know DaToo Aquarium Filter. Let's Go!!. POWERFUL FILTERING: In the process of raising fish, due to feeding and fish excretion, our fish tank will inevitably produce some harmful impurities and odor. DaToo Filter uses enhanced filter Cartridge with activated carbon, can effectively absorb harmful impurities in the water and remove odors from the tank. Large filter space, extra filter materials can be added as needed, such as biochemical ball, carbon bag, etc. Filtration capacity than similar products increased by 2 to 3 times.. ULTRA-QUIET: Humans need a good night's sleep, and so are fish. Noise can make fish irritable and even sick. But if you choose DaToo you don't have to worry about this.Ultra-quiet motor, multiple noise reduction designs ensure that DaToo offers you and your fish a quiet and comfortable night. Select DaToo Filter, Let us say goodbye to noise?. BPA-Free AND ENERGY SAVING: A safe and healthy material is crucial to the health of fish. Every component of the DaToo Aquarium Filter is made with High-quality, Sturdy, BPA-free plastic. Long-term use does not produce toxins, safe for you and your lovely fish.

FIT: Suitable aquarium tank is 1 Gallon~10 Gallon and will function in as little as 1.5 inches of water -- making DaToo Aquarium Filter not only suitable for fish tank but also for turtle tank and can creat a waterfall inside the tank.?Note: Please ensure that the water level exceeds the inlet?This is PERFECT for betta fish. Silent and flow does not blow the betta across the tank. I bought one to try it, REALLY like it, so I ordered some more for my other betta tanks. There is a TON of room in the media compartment to pack with media of your choosing. I put sponge on the bottom, filter floss in the middle, and a piece of course sponge on top of the filter floss. There is good flow, but does not bother the betta - he even swam inside the filter, lol. The price is right as well. Not sure how long it will last, but at that price? I'm ok if I have to buy a replacement every so often. Have been looking a long time for a good betta filter with roomy media compartment and low flow... for me and my planted tanks, this is perfect. I am running it fully submerged - I'm not concerned about breaking the water surface since I use air pumps with air stones in all my tanks. Sponge filters are really good for betta fish, but I have nano tanks, and sponge filters take up too much real estate in such small tanks. This filter is what I needed for my betta tanks. And also - the suction cups REALLY HOLD ON TIGHT. Such a simple thing but one where a lot of other filters miserably fail.So I have a betta in a five gallon with an internal filter, my motor stopped working and this filter was great in a pinch. Overall I have to give it 5 stars. It�s awesome for a betta fish, it has a very gentle flow, it�s nice and quiet. I like that it was able to go into the tank, because my tank was not built to have a hang on back filter. My only real complaint is that it�s bright white, it�s really ugly. I mean really unattractive. Why not black? Otherwise, great for bettas. Wouldn�t recommend for turtles, goldfish, or anything that needs a stronger filter.It did a great job of clearing up the water in our 6 gal. Aqueon rimless cube-tank and the water is now crystal clear and I do mean ""crystal"" but it required a few easy, cheap additions. As it comes out of the box, the included filter from DaToo was not enough to clear our water up so after reading up on it we added some ""Imagitarium Zeolite Crystals"" (sold by Amazon) in a small cloth bag behind or on the suction-cup side of the OEM filter panel, replaced the included filter panel with a size-Small Tetra filter cartridge panel...which was a tight fit but made it....and then added a small rectangle of polyester filter in front of, or on the discharge side of the filter body...there was room for both additions. With all three materials combined we have a great result and the DaToo filter is super quiet.Great little filter. My daughter wanted a low maintenance tank for a couple of fish and this filter is perfect. Hums quietly while pumping. Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. It was pretty straight forward to set up. I would buy it again.I bought this about 2 months ago now. As others have mentioned, the design is flawed and lets both filtered and unfiltered water through. That said, with some slight modifications it�s much better. I simply bought an aquarium sponge and cut it to size to cover the output. As an added my betta swam into it repeatedly, and the sponge stopped him from doing that.Why wouldn�t I just return it instead of buying and modifying a sponge to fit? This sucker is QUIET. I have my tank literally right next to my bed and it�s not a bother at all. I tried several whisper brand filters that were louder (although admittedly if I didn�t have the tank right next to my bed they would have been fine.)Some have mentioned noise. I noticed that when the unit was not filled with water that it was louder. So I can�t say how it would work in a turtle set up or similar. It seems to have actually gotten more quiet over time and is now practically silent in my 10 gallon.In my previous 5 gallon it did an okay job of filtering, but the current was a bit on the strong side. The flow is not adjustable. However in a 10 gallon with the sponge insert the current is low, but circulating, and since adding the sponge the filtration is great.I really wish it wasn�t white, as it does look as others have mentioned, cheap. I have a white tank I�ll be gifting out that I will pair it with, as it will match well. But with my current 10 (which has a black background which I love the look of) it�s really not aesthetically pleasing.All in all this filter is fine for the price, but if you don�t want your fish swimming into it like salmon up a river then it will require modification.Pro's:","Pro's:

Any questions, please do not hesitate to let us know.Very nice frame for the price. Looks good, sturdy enough, well packaged and damage-free when it arrived. I'll buy another one when I need it.One thing is I wouldn't bother buying it from ""Amazon Warehouse"" for a couple dollars off. I tried that at first and it was supposed to be ""like new"" but it had a large obvious scratch right in the middle of it and generally looked like it had been dragged behind a truck. Jut pay $20 for a new frame imo.I got an old map of North America that was made in 1869 and I wanted a frame to keep it protected. The 150 year old map looks beautiful in this frame. It�s cheap, and we�ll made. Whatever you�re framing may not be 150 years old, but it will look good in this frame.You would never guess the price of this by looking at it. The front comes with a protective plastic on both sides. This not only protects the delivery process but also the framing, it avoids finger prints.I used them for my "" The Saturday Evening Post"" pictures. Nothing great. It works for our house.Packaged well and arrived with no issues. I have had trouble ordering frames in the past from other sources and glass tends to break no matter how well it�s packaged.

If it�s possible that the product has a manufacturing defect, we�re always ready to help you.I have owned several of these type of pop up tents, ez-ups, etc. This one by far, hands down, is the most heavy duty one I have ever owned. I bought the teal color one, and even the shade material is really thick and fits very tight. The bag also has heavy duty rollers, comes with para-cord, stakes and also four nylon weight bags. Overall this awning is a beast. I would purchase another in a heartbeat for my backyard if I they had the same color. I have this as summer time shade structure in my backyard. I bought 10 inch tent stakes to make sure it doesn't take flight as well, I didn't know that it came with weight bags. I set this thing up by myself as I have done with many, and I am very pleased with how easy and well built this structure is.I needed something to cover the run for the chickens and this seems to be working fine. It's survived a storm, but because of the location there aren't any heavy winds that hit it. I am anxious to see how it handles snow. It was easy to get up, but there were four of us because of getting it over the fence on two sides.It has now snowed numerous times. I just get underneath it and get the snow off. I had water freeze in a corner, never leaked and I was able to pop it out of the corner. Love this canopy and so do the chickens. They are outside all winter long.First off, setup. Instructions leave a lot to be desired. Lines like, expand the frame. Trust, we had two people pulling corners, it wouldn't expand, not all the way. After 45 minutes of nearly bending metal and stressing plastic connectors, I tried pushing up on the interior poles, and voila. I have never set up a tent like this, and now that we figured it out it will be easier next time, but still. Instructions could have offered that tip. Other than that, looks great, shipping was fast, and once I've put it through wind and rain I'll let you know how it did. Feels sturdy, not really concerned.***update 10/2/2021So the canopy collapsed under heavy rain, which is weird because it was no worse than other rain showers we've had all summer. It's been up about 5 months, and we were loving it up until now. I can't figure out how to contact support, the website is down so I'm hoping someone from the company sees this and contacts me. All I need is a few frames, a few brackets, and a dozen screws and I could fix this.***update 10/15/2021So in case anyone is having trouble contacting the manufacturer like I was, I actually figured it out. So when you click the sellers name in a listing it takes you to the store, and there is no contact information there. When you bring up your order and click on support it takes you to a now defunct website, so no luck there. But to the right of the product listing, where it says ""sold by"", that link takes you to the seller page where I was able to contact them and they are resolving my problem as we speak. If everything goes according to plan, I will update again with a higher rating.Always looking for big tent during summer BBQ time, this tent when I got it, feels more like commercial grade, very sturdy and heavy. But it is quite easy you can assemble the tent just by two people, as matter of fact you can get the most of the job done by one person. The tent is quite large and not easy to wobble during windy situation.Very durable, great tent. Much better than a cheaper model I bought a coupleOf years ago.Probably could have used directions for the first time putting it up. You have to partially open it, then extend the roof poles before fully extending the tentPro's:","Pro's:

Text: polyester. Imported. Sleeps 6 people; Fits two queen air mattresses; Center Height: 72. CORE H20 Block Technology and adjustable ground vent. Features gear loft with lantern hook and pockets to keep items organized and off the tent floor. Includes rain fly, tent stakes, and carry bag. 1 YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY: We strive for total satisfaction with all of our products.The CORE 6-Person Dome Tent is a reasonably good tent at a reasonably good price. I purchased it as a loaner tent for when we have friends who want to camp with us who don't own a tent. We used it ourselves for a recent camping trip so that I could get some experience with the tent, how it sets up, quality, etc...First off, this is an easy tent to setup. We got it up in under ten minutes. Two cross poles make an ""X"" across the tent frame. Pretty standard stuff, nothing tricky, nothing out of the usual. The rain fly goes on easily as well and simply tensions to the tent corners with small plastic hooks. The hooks seem like a weak point. I would have preferred them to be made of metal.The other issue I have with the rain fly is that it doesn't go low enough and leaves an opening that wind can easily blow through (or rain) and which doesn't afford much privacy. When sitting down inside the tent, you can see out about a foot-high opening of clear daylight. Small children walking past can see directly into the tent. That's a bit of an issue. It does allow the tent good ""breath-ability"" in warmer months, but also means this tent is NOT suitable for colder weather.The zippers for the tent opening aren't super great either. They tend to snag and catch more than they should.Do yourself a favor and purchase real, quality tent stakes. The ones provided, while light, are pretty much junk. Good tent stakes are a must and can be bought for about $1.00 each at a hardware store.Overall, this is a big, roomy, decent-quality tent. It's worth the asking price. I'm happy we own it, but I much, much prefer our REI Basecamp 6 tent (which admittedly costs 3-4x what this one does). You do get what you pay for.This tent was awesome. I was looking for something that was easy for one person to set up for when I take my dogs out by myself but still wanted a big enough tent to fit my husband myself and our two large dogs. We purchased a couple cots to go in as well and it all worked so great together. I told my husband I wanted to set it up by myself for our first use to make sure that it was doable and was surprised with how quickly it went. Loved leaving the rain cover off and getting the amazing views of the stars at night. I would recommend this tent to anyone looking for one.Never thought i'd find such a great tent that was so simple to set up! Get this if you want to set up within 10 mins! And that is coming from a girly girl who cant follow directions at all. Great also inside, you can stand up in it, I'm 5'4 and id say there was maybe 2 inches of room left or more. I fit my Full size mattress in there with no problem and plenty of more space, you can fit up to a Queen in there with some room still to move around. The material is nice, held up in a really bad storm and pouring rain. Great tent for a decent price!Just got back from 16 days camping in the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. I was a bit nervous with a new tent. We had rain and high winds (high winds Norris campground in Yellowstone) almost every afternoon. Only once - after a major thunderstorm and drenching rain through the night (deep puddles everywhere throughout the Jenny Lake campground) - was there any water inside the tent and it was only about a 50 cent piece size puddle in one corner. Seriously good news since we were out for so long. I like the extra ventilation vent on the bottom. I did buy stronger stakes - the ones provided with most tents are a bit flimsy for me. Not the easiest to get back in the bag - especially when wet, but managed it. Also, the door zippers tend to catch on the rain protection material - just need to be patient with that aspect. Not a major deal for us since we stayed nice and dry and the tent stayed up in all the wind. Overall very happy with my purchase.Just got back from my first weekend using the tent. It's AWESOME! Great construction - looks cool and the company that builds the tent is first class. I emailed them with a couple of questions and they got back to me right away. Very good customer service.

What I will say is that:a) These work fine in John Deere X540 Lawn Tractorsb) They are almost precisely the same size as the standard 1156 bulbsc) They appear to be brighter, but it may be because the color temperature is far higher, and produce a pure white/blue light. They will certainly make you more visible as you ride around on your tractor.d) The heat the produce should not be a problem as the 1156 incandescent produces a lot of heat as wellFor a month, I've been driving an '01 CLK320. I'm used to a truck (_had_ a '95 Silverado). Since owning the CLK I find people are constantly walking behind me (within two feet) or driving behind me as I'm backing out of a parking space. It's really annoying, and dangerous. Can people not see I am backing up? Hmmm... Maybe I should make myself more noticeable by installing 2.8k lumen backup lights. They can deny seeing me, but they can't deny the sunburn from these bulbs. These things are outrageously BRIGHT. Once I get my backup cam installed, I won't have any issue with seeing at night on the cam.The ECU is throwing a ""defective lamp"" malfunction/code. I expected this, and I will not dock a star for it. I bought some resistors but was too lazy to install them just for backup lights. There's no hyperflash, just the system thinking I have a burned out bulb because these LED bulbs consume so little power compared to the stock incandescent BULBS. If you are buying these to use as turn signals or brake lights, you will need to either replace the blinker relay or buy resistors. Neither are very expensive, and both are pretty straight forward to install (the newer cars have the blinker relay either behind the speedometer, under the dash on the driver's side, on the driver's side of the dash, or in the TIPM under the hood).I'm extremely pleased with these bulbs and will be buying more.I'm not sure I'd use these inside, but then again, I do tend to like things almost obnoxiously bright. I used these to replace the 1156 incandescent bulbs on my new (to me) Wheel Horse C-120. It was these or install a light bar, and I can say that these easily replace the 18W light bar I had in mind. They're almost certainly as bright, maybe brighter (I'll have to compare them). In any case they get the job done that's for sure. Let's hope they last like the tractor has!I put these in my riding mower for the occasional times my mowing runs into dark o'clock. The factory lights on every mower I've ever owned have been weak at best. The mower charging systems seem to just barely able to keep the battery charged (factory lights dim when rpms are lowered) and LED bulbs use a lot less juice than incandescent bulbs.The difference in light output is amazing. The factory light on the left seems like a dim candle compared to the new LED on the right. I don't know for sure about the longevity yet but I've been replacing backup lights, turn signal and brake lights, golf car lights and others with LEDs for years and have yet to have any fail.Very happy with this purchase.I purchased a pair of these as replacements for incandescent lamps on one of our fire trucks. Very pleased! LEDs were a good fit, they seem to have good craftsmanship & solidly built... and definitely light up well... I'm going to guess almost double what the incandescent lamp output was... and the light is crisp white, not incandescent yellow. No word yet on durability or longevity - that'll take some usage time to see how that goes, but I'm pretty confident we'll see some good service from these LEDs.Pro's:","Pro's:

The light golden hue works perfectly with other accents in the room and makes a beautiful standalone centerpiece for a blank white wall.. THIN & MODERN: Only 0.31"" Thick which makes it one of the thinnest picture frames in the world. It complements the art without taking over and is designed to be crisp and modern while still working with more traditional decor. The perfect minimalist frame with just a touch of fancy.. WELL-MADE & STURDY: High-Strength Aluminum with extra tight corner joints makes the frame rigid despite being so slim. This exclusive ready-made frame is as close as you can get to high-end custom framing. But without the extra framing costs.. THICK ACRYLIC GLAZING: 99% UV Protection helps protect your art from fading. It's a Crystal Clear and Solid piece of acrylic compared to many frames that use cheap and flimsy styrene glazing. More Impact Resistant than glass which ensures safe delivery to your home.. EASY TO USE & REUSE: Smoothly Open the Back to fit your 12"" x 16"" print or photo into the frame. Hang it both vertically and horizontally with the pre-attached hangers. It's easy to switch artwork and reuse the frame for years.Most picture frames on Amazon are about an inch wide. I have a series of three photos, so I did not want a wide border around the frame. This classy minimalist frame is just a little more than 1/4 inch wide (.31 inches). It looks like wood, but it is made of sturdy aluminum. Pay no attention to the reviews that say the acrylic cover is blue, some people can't follow simple directions and did not remove the plastic wrap from both sides of the acrylic. These frames are more expensive than most, but you get what you pay for. I love, Love, LOVE them!Giving 3 stars because it does look nice, was hoping to have a glass front. Great to keep a larger picture lighter!I was confused at first by the blue color, as I had already removed what I thought was the only protective film. There is indeed protective film on both sides and although it�s very difficult to get the edge up of the second film once you remove it the plexiglass is crystal clear as stated in the ad. Sincerely embarrassed. A beautiful frame with definitely not blue plexiglass!The frame arrived extremely well packaged. So much so that I considered saving the packaging for a future move.This frame is so nice you were definitely not regret it.I couldn't find this thin of gold frame in any store unless I special ordered it and even then, the pricing for it was more than I was willing to pay. I finally looked on Amazon and after searching a little bit, I found this frame that had everything I was looking for. It has turned out wonderfully.These frames are spectacular! I purchased 4 different sized. These folks know the art of packaging! They are securely packaged and very well designed. I like the plexiglass over real glass. Real glass chips and makes the frames heavy to hang. These frames are very classy and elegant! In my photo is the 20x30 frame. The photography is courtesy my own. :)Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Microfiber PU casing (made in Japan) for long life. Four layers of natural foam. Perforated palm: better breathability. Anatomical shape / Grip: optimized fist placement. Fully assembled and hand sewn in ThailandVenum has several lines of boxing gloves, starting with Contender and ending with Giant.They all look beautiful, but vary a great deal in term of comfort, padding, and cooling.Disclaimer: I train in Muay Thai, twice/thrice per week, mostly doing mitt work/sparring. I use different (much lighter) gloves for bag work.I would advise to stay away from Contender�So, after a year of use these gloves have not shown any signs of wear or tear. Incredibly, the paint is still as vivid and solid as the day I�ve received them a year ago.I rotate between my other gloves bi-daily, and there are times when these aren�t used for at most 2 weeks. One thing that I�m always surprised about is, after coming back to these gloves, how incredibly tailored-made they seem, despite being mass produced. They just fit so incredibly well. The construction is also superb; these don�t feel cheap. Now, I own a pair of Fairtex and Cletos, and still�I�ll gladly use these in place of those any day.Overall, the looks and feel are still incredible. However, even after a year of use, they still feel quite sturdy and stiff, which may be a problem to some with more sensitive hands. As I said in my review a year ago, these gloves aren�t really forgiving for those with heavy hands and poor form. They�re a Striker�s glove. Technical, good form is a must.I originally ordered a pair of fairtex gloves but the shipping time took too long and I needed something quick so I overnighted these venom gloves via prime. I ordered the 16oz gloves for reference. The quality, fit and finish is very nice. They don�t feel like they�re going to fall apart and they have a nice sturdiness to them. The material is not real leather but in reality it holds up and looks just as good as leather (other people won�t look down on you for having the synthetic leather). My hands fits just perfect in these gloves and I�m 190 pounds. Without wraps my hands are snug but not tight. With wraps they are tight but a perfect �tight� when nothing will move around but it won�t cut your circulation off either. The padding is really good in this glove as well. I don�t feel a thing when I hit the heavy bag many times during training with hand wraps on. I use these gloves for Muay Thai so if you�re looking for a pure boxing glove these probably won�t be the right shape. They have a lot of padding on the palm as well. Overall I�m very happy with my purchase and if you aren�t getting one of the Thai brands this is the next best thing for the price.I was waiting to write this review, as I wanted to see how well these gloves would hold up over time. I'm happy to say they have held up well. I was especially concerned with whether they would develop an odor over time and the answer is NO! (I've been very careful to dry them well after using and spraying the inside with tea tree oil.) The gloves have great padding for protection and the wrist straps are very supportive. I was hesitant to spend this much money on a pair of gloves but I'm glad I did!My hands feel like they are lightning fast with these gloves. It could be I was using m my old gloves for wayyyyy too long and they were saturated with sweat and goop making them weigh 8 pounds each. These are great gloves for the casual boxer doing workouts. That is all I can vouche for since I am not an amateur or pro boxer of any kind. I marked a 4 star for comfort because my left thumb gets pinched a bit in the thumb box of the glove. I expect this will clear up as I break the gloves in more. I'd buy again.Pro's:","Pro's:

Enjoy the Outdoors:Perfect for creating ideal outdoor lounging, this gazebo offers 130 square feet of outdoor living space.This gazebo will offer you years of use.Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet gazebo! I put it together by myself but I probably could've used another person at least. Had to use a ladder to hold up the sides pieces while I connected them together. Took about 4 hours by myself to do. Some of the holes didn't line up so you've got to put a bit of elbow grease into getting some pieces to fit, but overall, very happy with this purchase. I suggest adding pebble gravel to the columns to weight it down if you're not screwing it into the deck or cement. Makes it super sturdy. Looks fantastic at a great value compared to other gazebos. Added string lights of my own to make it usable at night. Very happy with this purchase.This is one of the most cheaply made, and poorly manufactured items I have ever encountered, for $1300. The corner frames were really bent right out of the box, missing washers, a roof bracket that was welded on snapped off, and worst of all, the screw holes were completely misaligned, making it impossible to assemble!!!! The screws began stripping, and the gold devices that you screw the screws into, began spinning with each turn of the screw. I wasted a day and a half of my life, partially assembling, then disassembling this product, and repackaging it for a return! Now I have to lug a 150 lb box to ups, to ship it back! I feel like the manufacturer should have to pay me for all of my troubles!!! Ugh! This was a painful, wasteful and expensive learning experience!Perfect patio for our area. Feels a lot cooler under this than our cantilever umbrella or regular under roof patio. The Sunbrella top really knocks down the heat! Definitely took me longer than a few hours with just a little help from my wife, but well worth it. Seems to be made sturdy and should hold up for many years.I had spent about 3 weeks researching different products and manufacturers when I stumbled with this Titan. Box arrived when it should and after taking the instructions out and breezed thru the pages, I knew I had made a great investment. Started to assemble the legs and roof trusses quickly and easily. My wife helped to built the squared frame. The rest of the built was me alone and it took me 3 hours. We had a party that day and guests were marveled at the looks of this thing. It is absolutely gorgeous. Now to find a curtain because, unfortunately the sun's setting hour hits me in the face when sitting under it. I do recommend it overall.Ugh! It's driving us INSANE how water collects on the top. We have tried everything. I'm about to go punch about 8 grommets (one on each section) in where the water collects on the canvas. Hopefully, it will stop most of the mess. We purchased the orange, and I could swear less than 2 months later it has already started fading. It took forever for the guys to get it assembled. No, I wouldn't buy this again for the money. It should be around $500, not $1000. Lesson learned.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 2 1/4 inches of IMF (Injected Molded Foam) Tech is ideal for sparring or bag work. Durable and easy to clean synthetic leather shell with full wrap around hook and loop closure and attached thumb for safety. Get in shape one punch at a time with the comprehensive protection offered by these boxing MMA Muay Thai training workout gloves. A mesh palm to keep the hands cool and comfortable as you train to reach your fitness goals. These sparring punching bag mitts come in a variety of colors and are sure to give you a competitive high calorie burning workoutI've used a whole bunch of different training gloves. These are my favorites. Incredibly durable. About a year and a half of hard use from a big guy: I hit hard; I sweat a lot; I don't take particularly good care of my equipment. The only things I've noticed are a small hole in the internal fabric by my right middle finger tip and some obvious wear on the cosmetic design.No, these aren't fight gloves. They're for training. Heavy bag, light sparring - they're perfect. I've seen some comments that these may not be a full 16 oz. I'm not sure about that. If so, I feel bad for sparring with these. Otherwise, they are awesome gloves. The foam padding over the fist is more than adequate to absorb a great deal of impact but still communicate the feel of a punch snapping vs pushing, landing vs glancing, etc. They're not so big that you can cover your whole face with one like some other of those big pillowy gloves. The wrist support is pretty solid when snugged down tight. EASY on and off, unlike all of these wacky X-closures and overlapping straps that you need an engineering degree to take off.Great, great gloves. I'll buy another pair if these ever give out (maybe not in ostentatious gold, though)They feel great, they look amazing, the value is excellent.Amazing buy, exactly like the photos. Buy itthese are the best sparring gloves. quality is great & they're extremely comfortable!I absolutely LOVE these gloves, I have been training and competing in Muay Thai for over 4 years and I can say that these gloves are absolutely amazing for things such as sparring, hitting the heavy bag or even amateur competitions... however if you are going to compete at a higher level I would definitely recommend gloves by higher brands such as Fairtex or Yokkao... overall gloves are perfect and they do the job, got these a little over 2 years ago and I still break them out from time to time, and they still work just fine with minimal wear and tear... great bang for the buck overall and the gold/black color combo looks awesome as well...Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: CURVED DESIGN: Immersive 1500R curved viewing experience with panoramic images, vivid color, and incredible detail in 2K resolution. BE THE DIFFERENCE: Fast 1ms response time, and amazing 144Hz refresh rate give you the edge in all your gaming quests. SMOOTH GAMING: AMD FreeSync Premium technology enables smooth frame rates to aid you in battle. GAME ON: An arsenal of pre-set customizable visual modes keeps you ready for any FPS, RTS, or MOBA games. FLEXIBLE CONNECTIVITY: The VX2768-2KPC-MHD supports laptops, PCs, and Macs with HDMI and DisplayPort inputs. INCLUDED IN THE BOX: LCD Monitor, Power Cable, DisplayPort Cable, and Quick Start GuideThis is a 1440p, 144hz IPS panel for $280. You can't beat it. I used dual 1080p VA panels until 2021 because I was not going to pay the outrages prices, until I saw these. They arrived perfectly, no dead pixels. I took my old panels down and mounted these beauties to my existing VESA stand which supports up to 27"" monitors, as you can see in the photos. I noticed someone in another review deducted a star because the included stand is not adjustable. That's irrelevant when the monitors are VESA compatible. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of two of these monitors and I honestly can't see any downsides. The price is unbelievable, they're IPS panels, they're 1440p, they're 144hz, and mountable. What more do you want? Usually with a price like this there is some sort of compromise with the features. I see none.You can't enable freesync AND get 1ms response time It slows down to about 4.5-5ms response time.If you enable 1ms response time, the screen dims significantly but I think everything looks better with freesync.I'm not RTINGS but I did the blurbusters test and everything seems VERY nice for a $300 monitor.Moving from 21:9 non-curved to 16:9 curved is a shift but this thing is like an IMAX theatre.Shipping was a bit heinous so just be patient. Delivery took 10 days and FedEx seemed like they lost it a few times. It arrived in mint condition in the factory box.Comes with a displayport cable but I bought my own ahead of time.Lastly the shipping weight is 10 lbs but my monitor arm that supports 11 lbs can't hold this up. So I'm going to be purchasing a new monitor arm (hence the yoga foam block holding the monitor up)I haven't had a ViewSonic monitor since my dad gave me one with my first computer when I was a kid around 2005 and it was used CRT. Before this one I was using a 24 inch HP 1080p 60hz monitor and I was looking for something a bit bigger with better specs that didn't break the bank or have too much of that ""gamer"" look to it but this one seemed to fit my needs. The picture is very smooth and crisp of course with the refresh rate and resolution but it also has good color. I found my old HP monitor looked a bit washed out at times even with its IPS panel and color settings tweeked. There're a decent amount of settings to really tune it to your liking if that's your thing but all I did was turn the brightness up a bit since I like a brighter screen without affecting the backlight bleed too much. I haven't tested the speakers since I have a pair of Klipsch Promedias but I imagine they're just alright and will get the job done. Thickness of the monitor seems average but I don't have much to compare it to so you'll have to be the judge of that. The only games I really play are The Sims, Boarderlands and GTA 5 and they all look great on this thing. I set mine up with the Vivo adjustable desk mount instead of using the stand that came with the monitor to save some space on my desk. I paid $279 for mine in March and it wasn't on sale then so if you're thinking about buying a monitor then do it soon before prices continue to rise or stock becomes scarce like graphics cards.Right off, I know it's pretty obvious you have to turn the monitor on for it to work. But in the instructions and the ""quick start"" diagrams, they never mention what the 3 buttons on the back of the monitor are for. One is the on/off button of course. The other two are the craziest, most frustrating joy stick controls that you need to navigate, with no instructions, to even get the speakers to work. After I finally got the speakers on, the speakers are absolutely terrible. My last monitor had epic speakers that came with it. I expected better from Viewsonic. But hey I wasn't buying speakers, I bought a monitor view screen. And it's fine. I like it. It is supposed to be easier on the eyes and I'm not sure but it seems to be better. I'd buy it again because it this price, it's a good deal, in my opinion and I've had view sonic monitors for many years. Also, you have to download the drivers, of course, but finding that on the viewsonic web page was a chore, and I had problems with the site not working. It's a crappy website similar to sites I used to design back around 1984 (total crap). But again these nit picky things are not about the monitor, which is a good one. EDIT: Did I mention how seriously awful the speakers are? They're terrible, even for simple voice applications. Viewsonic should be embarrassed. Oh well, another purchase for some decent speakers.This is for the VX2768-2KPC-MHD, I Upgraded to curved from an older flat ViewSonic 27"" and what an amazing difference, plus it worked flawlessly with my 1660 super at native 2560x1440@144 using either the the HDMI 2.0 port or the 1.2 DP (with matching cables)... I must point out that This thing is Extremely blindingly bright, I had to turn it all the way down in the options to %15, other than that the picture is perfect.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 16x20x1 replacement air filters for your furnace, air conditioner, heat pump, or HVAC system (actual size: 15.50 x 19.50 x 0.75 inches). MERV 8 synthetic media (comparable with MPR 600 & FPR 5) protects homes from dust, pollen, and more by trapping 90% of airborne particles without impacting air flow. High-quality construction features an electrostatically charged, pleated design that captures more harmful particles and prolongs the products lifespan by 3 times that of fiberglass models. Industrial-grade beverage board frames with dual wire backings outperform standard cardboard designs. All components are manufactured within the United States and designed with recyclable materialsThese filters are great and do their job well. They have a study cardboard frame and fit securely. This helps the filter catch all the junk passing through. I have purchased these filters (16x20 and 20x30) twice now and will continue to buy them until I find they no longer work as they should. I would recommend.NOTE:One of the ""Rate Features"" listed is for Packaging. I rate that a ONE STAR because the standard packaging used to ship these filters caused the filters to arrive in various forms of dent or bent.The Amazon Team keeps removing my review for these filters when I reference packaging/shipping, yet I don't understand why because that is one of the things they request a Rating for. Either way, this is why I added my comments to support the low rating. Thanks!I've been using these for over a year now. Great filters and better quality than what I can get locally (especially when all the new build houses use the same size and they're always out of stock). Great airflow so the HVAC system isn't damaged, but picks up most air pollutants.Also, I ordered the 6 pack and last time I only got 4. I contacted their customer service and they sent 2 more out to me immediately. I appreciate the timely and easy customer service =)Easy to install, well labeled. Good particle trapping so far, although filter has not taken a beating yet in our Florida heat. This is my second purchase of same. Will continue to use as long as available through Amazon. Delivered timely and none crushed. Good value, too.The filter is working like it should, loved the price and certainly appreciate that they are made in the USA. There were many comments regarding the outside packaging not holding up so the filters were arriving damaged. Most of the those reviews were older so maybe the packaging was upgraded, mine arrived in perfect shape.Does a great job.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: ISOLATE BLEND - Scientific studies have shown that a blend is considerably better for maximizing muscle-building than standard whey protein Alone, This blend contains whey protein isolate, micellar casein, milk protein isolate, and egg white protein.. GREAT TASTE - No other protein powder surpasses the great taste, texture, and nutrition of Pro JYM. Simply mix with water, milk, almond milk or add other Ingredients For a delicious high protein shake or smoothie. It also comes in chocolate.. PERFECT RATIO - Pro JYM contains the ideal ratio of the three optimum proteins for building muscle: 50% casein, 40% whey and 10% egg protein. For both men & women, This blend supports your natural strength, energy, endurance & recovery.. NO SPIKING - Pro JYM does not include cheap amino acids that can lead to protein Spiking. Each serving contains 24 grams of whole proteins, it is optimal for lean muscle growth, as a higher percentage of calories are derived from the protein.. VERSATILE USE - the Pro Powder is the best before & after workouts, in the morning, between meals and at night. The blend of fast, medium and Slow digesting proteins elevates muscle protein synthesis for longer and supports rebuild.Loving the taste of the vanilla flavor. It's not too sweet and very natural tasting. It appears to have actual vanilla bean in it...I like the idea of a lot of three protein types--milk, egg, whey--to cover all the bases.Finally, there are no dumb extra ingredients added like BCAAs etc. These extra ingredients don't always agree with me, and I would rather have my supplements separate so I can better control dosage.Good job Pro Jym!I have recently transitioned to Jym supplements and I have to say I�m so very pleased. I purchased the Tahitian Vanialla Bean Pro for the first time and when it comes to taste of you like vanilla(especially vanilla bean) I�d say it�s definitely the best.... I�ve never been a big vanilla fan of anything so next time I�ll get another flavor, but it�s definitely good!This protein is a very unique with their different flavors without the fillers. The creator of this product is from a person is a scientist and a bodybuilder just look at his YouTube videos. He will explain on how to use his products without hesitation. Try this product todayLove this protein powder I have tried all kinds because of gastric surgery I will always have to drink protein shakes 2-3 times every day and this is one of the best I�ve found over the years mixes nicely tastes great alone or adding scoop of PB fit tastes awesome or anything else you might likeI have had this with both milk and water. It's bland but palatable. Protein powder taste is important to me in order to maintain consistency. When you use milk instead, it tastes like melted vanilla ice cream. Makes for a great evening dessert like shake. Would recommend if you drink these with milk.Conversely, I've also had both of their chocolate mousse, and rocky road flavors and I prefer their taste with water instead of milk.Pro's:","Pro's:

It is very sturdy and not wobbly, it stays put and still while using it, and I have quite a bit of weight sitting on top of it too, which it is supporting without any issues.The only reason I didn�t give this item 5 stars is because when I opened the box I had scratches on two of the legs and wasn�t sure if it was used or just handled roughly during the initial boxing. Aside from that I am very satisfied with the product. It�s perfect for my home office. I trade stocks and the amount of desk space this provides is tremendous.

A little bit of black is essential in every room and a few black picture frames on a wall is enough to tie things together. This matte black frame enhances the colors around it and can be used in any home style.. THIN & MODERN: Only 0.31"" Thick which makes it one of the thinnest picture frames in the world. It complements the art without taking over and is designed to be crisp and modern while still working with more traditional decor. The perfect minimalist frame with just a touch of fancy.. WELL-MADE & STURDY: High-Strength Aluminum with extra tight corner joints makes the frame rigid despite being so slim. This exclusive ready-made frame is as close as you can get to high-end custom framing. But without the extra framing costs.. THICK ACRYLIC GLAZING: 99% UV Protection helps protect your art from fading. It's a Crystal Clear and Solid piece of acrylic compared to many frames that use cheap and flimsy styrene glazing. More Impact Resistant than glass which ensures safe delivery to your home.. EASY TO USE & REUSE: Smoothly Open the Back to fit your 16"" x 24"" print, photo, or poster into the frame. Hang it both vertically and horizontally with the pre-attached hangers. It's easy to switch artwork and reuse the frame for years.Most picture frames on Amazon are about an inch wide. I have a series of three photos, so I did not want a wide border around the frame. This classy minimalist frame is just a little more than 1/4 inch wide (.31 inches). It looks like wood, but it is made of sturdy aluminum. Pay no attention to the reviews that say the acrylic cover is blue, some people can't follow simple directions and did not remove the plastic wrap from both sides of the acrylic. These frames are more expensive than most, but you get what you pay for. I love, Love, LOVE them!Giving 3 stars because it does look nice, was hoping to have a glass front. Great to keep a larger picture lighter!I was confused at first by the blue color, as I had already removed what I thought was the only protective film. There is indeed protective film on both sides and although it�s very difficult to get the edge up of the second film once you remove it the plexiglass is crystal clear as stated in the ad. Sincerely embarrassed. A beautiful frame with definitely not blue plexiglass!The frame arrived extremely well packaged. So much so that I considered saving the packaging for a future move.This frame is so nice you were definitely not regret it.I couldn't find this thin of gold frame in any store unless I special ordered it and even then, the pricing for it was more than I was willing to pay. I finally looked on Amazon and after searching a little bit, I found this frame that had everything I was looking for. It has turned out wonderfully.These frames are spectacular! I purchased 4 different sized. These folks know the art of packaging! They are securely packaged and very well designed. I like the plexiglass over real glass. Real glass chips and makes the frames heavy to hang. These frames are very classy and elegant! In my photo is the 20x30 frame. The photography is courtesy my own. :)Pro's:","Pro's:

I promise you'll be holding yourself back from eating the whole box in the first sitting!!!First, the bars are fine. They taste like a less-sweet snickers bar. But, the packaging is a complete environmental disaster. The bars came nested in two boxes with dry ice, multiple gel ice packs, and a huge styrofoam container. Beware that you will have to throw all of that away. It took up 1/3 of my trash can that week. Plus I had to throw away three gel ice packs. I can't believe the company is selling these bars with the waste associated with shipping. Do they know that global warming is an actual thing? How can any company with a conscience sell bars that need that much packaging? NEVER AGAIN.This keto snack bar tastes mike Baby Ruth and Snickers had a baby! I�m always a bit hesitant in trying �healthy� snack bars - I want them to taste great! This bar does and tastes more like a dessert treat than a snack. The box of bars was delivered within a styrofoam container, kept cool with dry ice. This level of consciousness to providing a high quality product scored big points with me; I was worried my bars would arrive melted and deformed during the summer heat.Package arrived frozen solid in dry ice on a steamy hot day in June. I had to smile since the vendors obviously fixed the problem from one star reviewers who received melted snack bars.After it thawed out, I enjoyed eating a bar that has a rich flavor along with lots of texture that I find satisfying. I'm diabetic so I appreciate a snack bar that has little affect on my blood glucose level. I hope you like these as much as I do.Pro's:","Pro's:

PRE- AND POST-WORKOUT FUEL: Pure Protein Bars are perfect for before or after a workout. Grab a protein bar about an hour before a workout to provide carbs and protein for energy and lean muscle support. Treat yourself after your workout to replenish energy and help the muscle recovery process. Fuel your workout and nutritious balanced diet.These bars taste amazing. I love to start my day with coffee and an energy bar for breakfast. My usual brand increased in price so I gave these a try. I love them but they do not love me. After a few days of consumption, I suffered the ""gastrointestinal discomfort"" due to sugar alcohols - a warning that is clearly printed on this package in fact. I certainly wouldn't consider one bar a day over consumption, so it's probably just an intolerance to the maltitol on my part. Never again :(If you are looking for a protein bar that is not overloaded with carbs and sugars, like most protein bars are these days, you have come to the right place. I have Type 2 diabetes, so the first thing that I look at on a nutrition label is the sugar content. Most protein and energy bars have so much sugar in them that you might as well be eating a Snickers bar. This bar has the lowest amount of sugars (2g with 6g of sugar alcohol) and carbohydrates (16g) that I have found anywhere. The vast, vast majority of ""protein"" bars have WAY more carbs than they do protein. This bar is a very rare exception in that regard as well.At a fairly light 200 calories, Pure Protein may not be a complete ""meal replacement"", but it definitely makes for a great snack for those wishing to stay on a high protein diet and not send their blood sugar levels flying through the roof. It is a good source of sustainable energy and the taste isn't too bad. I would definitely never confuse it with a peanut butter cup. The overall taste is a bit bland and the chocolate is darker than the milk chocolate you will find in most candy bars. Still, if you have a craving for chocolate or something sweet, these bars are satisfying enough.I will upload a photo of the nutrition label for this product, since it doesn't seem to be included in the description for whatever odd reason. There are no substantial numbers of vitamins or minerals in this product, so it definitely does not replace a multi-vitamin supplement or most protein shakes. It does include a disclaimer about sugar alcohols possibly causing intestinal discomfort. If you are only eating a single bar at a time, I have not known this to be a problem though. If you eat a few of them you will most likely see some slight discomfort though.Another odd disclaimer on the label mentions, ""Partially Produced with Genetic Engineering"". As far as I know, manufacturers are not forced to disclose this fact in the United States, but they may be in Canada, where these bars are produced. Pretty much any processed foods are apt to contain GMOs. Typically, you are just never told about it though. At least Pure Protein is being up front about it. These bars also contain Sucralose. Some people do not react well to this ingredient. As a diabetic, I use Sucralose often though and do not have any side-effects unless I consume way too much of it at once. There is also some soy, but other than that it is absent a lot of scary sounding chemical ingredients.If you are looking to snack while controlling your blood sugar levels, I can't recommend this product highly enough. If you are only concerned with taste, buy a Snickers bar. With 20g of protein and a minimum of sugars and carbs, this is one of the healthiest snacks you will find that tastes good and satisfies your sweet tooth. They are expensive from the perspective of cost/grams, but you are not going to find a better deal when it comes to quality protein in a compact, portable, highly tasty form.Don't be fooled like I was. The product they are displaying is not what you get the picture on the left or the more clear one is a screenshot of the product I bought. The one on the right or the more dim blurry one is the product I got. The bars I got have more fat and cholesterol and have nowhere near the nutrients. They are advertising these super healthy almost supplement bars but they are just fancy sugar bars with protein.I love this product when I buy from the store. The store never has the value packs anymore so I set up auto delivery on Amazon, excited for the convenience.My first box really tastes terrible. Not fresh at all. Hard, stale...pretty disgusting overall and I know it�s not the product itself bc I�ve always loved it from the store. Giving autoship one more try then cancelling if it�s the same.I ordered both the ""Chocolate Deluxe"" and ""Chocolate Peanut Butter"" bars from Pure Protein to see which I liked best. I'm comparing them here since one is great and the other is meh.For me the ""Chocolate Peanut Butter"" was the clear winner. Both are tasty with a great mix of protein, carbs, and fats, but the texture of the filling of the ""Chocolate Deluxe"" was not nice.The texture of the ""Chocolate Peanut Butter"" bar is a lot like a Rice Krispy bar, but a bit more dense, less sweet, and more filling. Ironically the inside of the ""Chocolate Deluxe"" had a texture in my mouth that felt like peanut butter and gritty corn meal that sticks to all your teeth. It tastes okay, but is simply unpleasant to eat.The ""Chocolate Peanut Butter"" bar with a large latte makes a filling, enjoyable, and protein packed breakfast of only 300 calories. I have type 2 diabetes as well as other chronic health problems. In the mornings I often feel poorly and don't feel up to preparing a healthy breakfast. Now I can microwave a cup of milk, add a double espresso, and enjoy one of these bars with my milky coffee for a easy breakfast that is healthy, yet tastes a bit decadent.Pro's:","Pro's:

Contains a significant source of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and ZincThese used to be my favorite, go to, protein bars; not only did they taste great, they were filling, had a small amount of fat (5g) compared to most bars on the market, and they had ample protein to make it worth your while to eat them.Well that is over, they just changed the formula with a new and improved taste with more protein! Bad news, although it may be new, it is certainly not improved! These are no longer great tasting, they now have a ridiculous amount of fat (12g), and they only managed to increase the protein content by a measly 2g, bring them to 30g of protein in total.Bad move MetRX, dump these ""New and Improved"" chocolate chip cookie dough protein bars and go back to the original formula!! Will not purchase these ""New and Improved"" chocolate chip cookie dough bars again!! Thanks for ruining a good thing!!This review almost does not need to be written at all. If you are into training or bodybuilding and do not know what Super Cookie Crunch is by now then you must be living under a rock or else locked in solitary confinement somewhere. These bars are legendary, and for very good reason as they are outstanding.They are packed with protein and fill you up like a meal. These also taste sensational, about like your favorite candy bar. Nutritional distribution and protein is on point. If you are one of those people that has a hissy fit over sugar, these are probably not a good choice for you, but for anyone else it's good to keep a box of these in the pantry on days you are in a hurry and heading out the door. Lastly, as an FYI, I can similarly recommend the PB Pretzel bar and (especially) the apple pie version. Both are sensational. I am not a fan of the cookie dough version. It reminds me too much of eating a quest bar, so like chewing on road tar essentially.I recently got back into the gym and my boyfriend recommended these as a pre-workout meal. He raged about them and spoke so highly, saying that you can�t taste that harsh protein flavor in these. Now, he knows how picky I am, and one thing that bothers me about protein bars is that harsh protein flavor that makes it so hard to get through. I usually can only have a bite or two and I�m done. But with these!!! It�s a different story! They truly are ALL that! I initially tried the chocolate and peanut butter flavor and I thought it tasted ok. My boyfriend assured me I would love them, I just had to find a flavor I really like. So I tried the Vanilla Caramel Churro... and OMG! They are absolutely delicious! Dangerously delicious. They taste just like cinnamon rolls. No harsh protein flavor at all! These will now be my go-to protein bars. Love love love!I always hated buying protien bars only to have them taste like complete garbage where you want to vomit every bite, well not anymore thanks to met-rx.Met-rx has come out with this meal replacement bar that is jelly donut flavored. Besides being very addictive and healthy, the jelly donut flavor is exactly what you would think it would taste like. Every bite is a delicious reminder of a jelly donut without the horrible calories and saturated fat that comes with the fried pastry. It comes all 9 bars of course as ordered, no complaints here and I would highly recommend MET-RX for those looking for a meal replacement protein bar or a healthy addictive snack.Since amazon has grouped the reviews I'm also adding the review for the vanilla churro crunch MET-RX meal replacement bar.The vanilla churro crunch reminds me of the holidays in every bite, each bite giving a nice warm memory with an aromatic blast of vanilla and spice. I can feel good and healthy eating these meal replacement bars as well as enjoy the wonderful flavor. Again I definitely recommend these overIf you like MetRX's Apple Pie flavor, you will like the Churro because it's the same over-priced meal bar just without the Apple bits in it. I cannot find this at my local grocery chain so I have to wait for a decent sale on this stuff as it is way overpriced- even in the stores... especially if you know how to break down the MSRP math. Profit margins are insane.... Anyway...I am not a fan of ""diet"" brown chocolate or large peanut bits so this is right up my alley.Just be advised, the type & recipe consistency is the same as the Apple one. Happy snacking.Pro's:","Pro's:

(Meet to be used as a temporary one, not for daily use). Sweet Reminder:We advise customers to never leave canopy tent up overnight or under bad weather conditions. It is up to customers decision to determine the correct weather condition when you choose the party tentI was hosting my son's graduation party and needed a tent for the occasion. This was the perfect option. It was perfect for shade and while it did not rain during the party, it did the next day while the tent was still up and it resisted rain quite well and would have been fine at the party. All in all a great option for the price! I've already had someone ask if they can borrow it. Only one item to note, you will most definitely need a few people to assist with the assembly and moving it if needed.It would have cost us several hundred dollars to rent a tent for the afternoon of my sons graduation party. This was just as nice of an option and we will have it for my daughters graduation as well in three years!Wonderful product and excellent customer serviceI was looking for a 20x20 canopy for my daughters baby shower but majority of them were way out of our budget. I came across this one and decided why not give it a shot. I bought 2 of the 10x20 canopy's and put them together to make our own 20x20. They worked perfectly! My husband, with the help of two other people, had them both up with in a half hour. It's a great canopy, the material is pretty good quality for the price. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a canopy.I bought this to protect the contents of our basement after and 15"" flood. We needed to remove the entire contents of the basement while we waited to have the floor raised 12"" of stone/concrete. It took almost 2 weeks to be complete and dry and this tent stayed in place all that time. We had some terrible weather ( rain and high winds) and since we had no choice it had to stay up even though the directions advised against this. Not only did the tent hold up, didn't leak, and no pipes bent or broke over this extended time. This tent looked ""lovely"" in our backyard so I would recommend it for a more formal occasion as it is advertised and for the price you will not find a better deal and find more uses than just as a party tent.

This hoop color won't come off or fade, so you can wear this hoop where ever and whenever your heart desires.. Slightly adjustable nose hoop easy to take on and off with a simple twist moving up and down. ""Feeds"" through the nose and has a ""stopper"" piece that keeps it in place inside the nostril.. Hoop size 6mm to 7mm depending on your nose size... this hoop could be the snug tiny hoop you are looking for.This 22 gauge ring is small enough to be thin and pretty but strong enough to hold it's curved shape after being bent out so I could put it in. It is also a smaller loop, making it fit closer to my nostril, which I like. It was the perfect purchase for me.20 dollars well spent . Its not to thick or to big and it gives me a bit of a edgy look. I really like it .First very comfortable! I really like how dainty this hoop is and how is it is to put on. My hubby never really liked my nose stud so I was very surprised that he liked the hoop. Love it!!!Easy to bend to fit snug. I have allergies to most metal, so the fact that it hasn't caused any irritation is a good sign. I was worried bc of other comments but it's fine so far. Love how thin it is as well.I love the comfort, size. Not allergic to it! FantasticPro's:","Pro's:

Text: Full set of clubs right out of the box!. Maximum forgiveness on the woods and irons equals straighter shots on the course!. Matching Deluxe Dual-Strap Golf Bag and Headcovers! Carry your bag like a backpack! Rainhood also included!. Tall Size available for 6'1"" and above!I�m not a pro golfer, just go out with my friends or my dad occasionally. Wanted to get something new than my old hand-me-down clubs from HS.I am pleasantly surprised this is a pretty solid set of clubs! You�re not gonna impress anyone with them, but it beats borrowing someone else�s! All the clubs have True Temper brand shafts which are Made In USA which is nice to see. I LOVE the hybrid club! Even if you hit it wrong you still get a straight shot.Only club I can�t seem to hit is the driver, but I have a couple others I can use instead.Bag is great too! Like it more than my old Adams Golf bag. Lighter and and I like the handles. Nothing super special but looks good and seems solid.You�re not gonna get a full set of clubs but you got all the basics and then you can source a few others (like a sand wedge) and you�re good to go!Solid purchase.P.S. I�m 6�4� and the extra length is awesome!These clubs have been playing well, which is nice considering this is my first time actually buying ""tall"" clubs (I'm 6'6'' in case anyone reading this is wondering about height capabilities). However, the head of the putter is already separating from the shaft. I find this to be quite disappointing with only playing 6 rounds of 18 hole golf. I will be contacting the seller and the manufacturer for replacement inquiries, and I can only hope that the rest of the clubs stay in good shape.Great starter set, Girlfriend wanted a set that wasn�t too girly and but it had to be blue so I came across these. They hold up quite well. They aren�t fancy, if you are a weekend golfer I would say you could get better but for a beginner these are perfect. They have good feel, the grips are good and overall they are easy to hit. They have held up well through the past few rounds and dozen or so range visits, no crazy scratches or broken club heads. Also surprisingly great bag, super light and well made. Will update if anything changes but for sub 200 these are great. These will help you on your path to life long play.This was an excellent golf set for someone learning the sport like myself at the time of purchase; however, as my game improved I purchased a new set specific for my measurements. The irons on this set are impressive regardless of skill or experience. The driver is the least impressive piece of an overall outstanding golf set. I would highly recommend this set to anyone learning the sport and for intermediate players looking for a nice set of irons to complement their game.These clubs are definitely a starter set. I bought these for my son to start golf lessons with. One of the kick stand legs bent easily and not even sure how it happened. Clubs scuff easily, but like I said, they�re a good starter set without having to spend a ton of money.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Contemporary style; black; smooth wrap finish. Each frame includes: acrylic facing, cardboard backing and wire hanging kit (assembly required). Each frame holds a 17 inch by 22 inch photo/print/poster. Frame moulding is 1 inch wide; wood composite material. Frame is designed for WALL HANGING only (hanging hardware allows for portrait or landscape orientation)Customers who know little to nothing about a frame's quality are writing here and touting these as the best frames under the sun - maybe they are the best frames in their apartments, but certainly not under the sun. Fact is, these are average frames at best. One of mine, btw, arrived scratched and the other one was so dusty I had to put on my dust mask, and disassemble the plexiglass, cardboard and frame to clean it, using 5 brand-new microfiber towels in the ordeal. Of course, you are forced to buy 2 frames because they won't sell you just one, which is what 50% of customers will need (either 1 or 3 or 5, etc,). It's like buying 1 gallon of milk for $7 and getting the second gallon free - which you then have no use for bc your family can only drink 1 gallon before the 2 gallons expire. So I threw out the scratched frame sand use the now-dusted but fair one.The seller answered someone saying these frames cannot be returned bc they are built as they are ordered. This is, of course, a lie: If they built them as they are ordered, why then are some sizes unavailable - they are grayed out, as if they ran out of that size...that ain't building them as they are ordered, is it? The same goes for colors: some colors are offered for some sizes but not for others. If they are built as they are ordered, why not just color the frames then? Of course the Seller will have another lie to justify their first lie...Oh, and don't plan of any customer service: These guys just want to sell you the frames and not hear from you ever again, other than, of course, to buy more frames from them. Write to them to make a warranty claim and they won't answer your email. Losers!Purchased these frames because the reviews suggested that they were at the higher end of inexpensive pictures frames. I was very disappointed with them. The frames arrived with over half of the corners defective. The joints were not even, and bare wood showed through the uneven seams (contrasting with the black color of the frame). Also, the plastic-like black laminate that gives the frame its color was not lined up evenly with the end of the frame, causing it to stick out from and peel from the frame at each of the corners (I've attached a few photos of examples). I returned the frames for a replacement. The replacements arrived two weeks later and had the same defects. I recommend you save your time and not purchase this brand of frames.The frame looks really nice with our vintage poster, however the hardware to hang the frame is not attached and there are no pre-drilled holes for installing the D-ring. When we tried to install it, the Plexiglass broke, causing my husband to shout many expletives. We were much more careful with the 2nd one, so it looks fantastic! Customer service was prompt and kind in providing a replacement.As someone who has purchased this frame over a dozen times I can honestly say that the quality the price it is amazing. Yes, it�s light weight but it does not feel cheap. I�ve purchased in every size they offer and the consistency In quality is always the same. The black frames are matte which in my option makes them a little more sophisticated looking, rather than the glossy black frames you find at your local craft store. I�ve also purchased in walnut, which is nice as well.The �glass� is plexi glass which comes with contact paper on both sides. When you take the contact paper off it creates a bit of static, so try and do this in a clean space or else�s you will have fuzz and lint all over your plexi glass. It�s easy enough to clean off, but why not just try to avoid that step all together.I gave these frames 5 stars because they hold up well, the price is great, and they come in a variety of sizes.The frames are much higher quality than I expected and look great! You do have to install the hardware on the back on your own, but it's not too bad of an install. They're very lightweight, which is an awesome feature with curious and agile pets around the house. Despite being lightweight, they definitely don't look it - first glance you'd think they were pretty heavy - definitely a great quality frame fit for a nicer print. My only complaint is that despite measuring the dimensions pretty closely, the frame was a tad bit too small for my prints (I'm talking mm on either end). I have a scrapbook slicer though, so with a few careful small cuts on the top and bottom, it fit just fine. This definitely could've been Society6 (the company I bought the prints from) having a little wiggle room in their print dimensions, so I wouldn't necessarily fault the frames - it's just something I noticed. Overall, a great product for a great price. The plexiglass even has a slight sheen to it to make it look glass-like. Love it!Pro's:","Pro's:

Today was a turning point in my naive line of thinking. I felt like I went to a yard sale and got ripped off. This frame is nicked from head to toe, whether very obvious or very faint. I was going to put a very meaningful picture in this frame as a Christmas gift for my fiance, but that will definitely not be happening. At first I was thinking ""hmm maybe it won't be so noticeable"", but the more and more I stared at this thing, my eyes hurt thinking of the pain that this frame endured (andddd couldn't get over the visibly chipped black paint). The packing style was actually very well done and very secure - which is concerning because there was really no possible way this was damaged in shipping...meaning that someone knew this was damaged and shipped it anyway. I'm beyond frustrated with my experience with this frame and company. Additionally, depending on where you live (US), you may get slapped with a small international fee that appears out of no where, and is not mentioned in the process at all. If you don't believe the negative comments, I was just like you so please believe this one when I say, save your money and go elsewhere!For the price these frames were wonderful. We bought three to frame our 3 year olds art work to add color to our home. The frame was tightly packaged when it arrived and we were fortunate to have no scratches on our frames (yay!). The frames all ahead the hanging wire and looked amazing when we put them up.The same frames at Michaels and other stores were double/triple the price. We were very pleased with our frame purchase. Amazon for the WIN. Thanks Amazon!Was pleasantly surprised with how durable it is. There were a bunch of black frames available, some with sketchy review histories so I thought I'd let everyone know this was a good one.I used it for my poster of one of my favorite song lyrics from MercyMe as well as a great movie. It looks gorgeous hanging in my bedroom where I see and read it every day!!! Beautiful frame!!It�s a decent frame for the price point. It is plexiglass and came with a covering on the front so it didn�t get scratched (which is what�s bunched up on the picture). The back has multiple hangers so you can choose how you want to hang it. It did come with a slight bubbling along the frame but it isn�t that noticeable and it is fine for now.Pro's:","Pro's:

Sky Max 2.0 models are backed with a 10 year limited warrantyI purchased this bag 1.5 years ago. I have used it perhaps half a dozen times. The two back wheels on the case have completely deteriorated. I dropped the bag off for warranty repair at at an authorized Delsey repair shop (Rockville Shoe Hospital in Rockville, MD). The repair facility denied that the wheels were covered by Delsey's warranty and insisted that I pay $39/wheel to replace the wheels, which would exceed the cost of buying a new bag. More fundamentally, let me pose a question: How could wheels on a rolling bag not be covered by warranty? Buyer beware.This is my second time using DELSEY luggage. Very durable and light weight. I am a flight attendant, so I use this luggage almost every day. I really recommend it. This one in particular, is very suitably for a crew member or anybody else.I'm happy with the product but this was not a new suitcase it has a stain on the front and the wheels are dirty and have been wheeled outside. I am forwarding pics and expect some kind of compensation. I cannot return as I'm leaving on Saturday June 2.Easy move ability! Great strength in fabric. I purchased one in Maui and loved it. I bought this one for my son this past Christmas. He loves it. Note it fits the luggage regulations if you don�t count the wheels.

However, as I opened it I discovered that the back was literally a piece of cardboard. Do yourself a favor and skip this frame. I don't understand why they cut a corner and put a weak piece of cardboard as the back. I kept it but I was really disappointed in the quality because of the cardboard back. I had to use my own hanging hardware and drill it into the frame because I didn't trust their hardware since they cut corners on the back w/ a flimsy piece of cardboard. I will say it one more time: a piece of this frame is the side of a cardboard box.Great that they put this sticker on the side of the plexiglass that has no cover.

Text: nanSo, I hesitated writing this review, because I do not like to leave negativity, however, for the Money I spent on this Canopy, I feel this Review is justified. This is a very CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT. As we were trying to get this Canopy up, one of the Legs totally popped out, we could not just easily pop it back in, we had to get a ""HAMMER"" and someone conform it to go back in. Almost everything on this Canopy is Plastic, very poorly made, this is something you would buy at a Toy Store for your Children to play house or something. Plus it took like 30-40 minutes to get this thing up and running. Don't waste your hard earned money on this purchase, invest in something STRUDY and go with a reputable company like ""EZ-UP"". VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS!!!!Was disappointed. Have had a couple of these over many years and this one not as durable. Leaked all over. Not sturdy corner panels. Easy setup. Frame good. Middle stabilizer was nice. Extra stakes helped.We had a very heavy rain storm with wind 2 days in a row and it withstood her well.. I put all my chairs w cushions inside it and nothing got wet. Very pleasedI just installed the tent, and it already has three rips and by touching the material it looks like very poor quality which I�m pretty sure it�s not going to last but just a few months if that.Item was not very sturdy.

I currently put my workout clothes, hats, and scarves in it. I wouldn't really suggest trying to store heavy sweaters or jeans in it.

Text: Solid Wood. Made in US. Victorian style; decorative gold facing with beaded inlay and darker gold sidewall. Frame includes: glass, rigid black backing and pre-attached stamped hanging hardware. Frame holds a 12 inch by 16 inch photo/print (viewable area is reduced by .25"" on each side due to the frame lip). Frame moulding is 0.75 inches wide; real poplar; solid wood. Made in the U.S.A.Well made frame. It tolerated my clumsy ""carpentry"" withot breaking. I've been painting on stretched canvas for a number of years but this is the first time I have framed one. I'm perfectly happy with the results.I received this frame today and couldn't be happier! I purchased it to hold my college diploma (yay!) and it's perfectly ornate enough to look ""adult"" but not stuffy or gaudy at all. Also, such a great deal for what it is. The frame looks super expensive, but it's perfectly affordable. I was a little concerned about the thickness of the frame, but the outsides are no more than an a half an inch. Another bonus, it comes with the mounting instruments, and the ""teeth"" on the back are positioned for it to be mounted horizontally OR vertically. If you're on the edge about purchasing, I hope this review persuades you into doing so! Great frame for a great price. Looks super awesome on a wall.I bought this frame (8 x 12, gold) for a signed print I bought. The print itself is an awkward size at about 8 3/5 and 11 1/2. This was the second frame I bought for it, the first one being way too small. I was hoping I wouldn�t have to cut the picture down, as some frames come with a little bit of room to spare that the frame actually covers. Sadly, I did end up cutting about 1/8 off of each side mainly because I didn�t want to send back another frame but also because I think this frame size is the closest I would get to an accurate fit. It�s a nice frame, solid construction, and came packaged really well and frustration free! My print looks awesome and the frame fits in great with my other frames. I have no regrets and am thankful I found a frame in this size.This frame fit my 16 x 20 canvas perfectly. The width of the canvas was 1/2�, which was completely hidden by the frame. I did not use the plexiglass front. Very happy with the quality.We've ordered three different Craig frames and have been completely satisfied with the quality, particularly given the reasonable price. If we had to buy frames locally, or have pictures framed at a shop, the cost would be much higher. We are particularly impressed with the meticulous packaging. It is so well packed, that even maltreatment by a delivery person is unlikely to harm the frame. The plexiglass insert is covered on both sides with tightly adhered cling film to prevent scratching. (Be sure to remove film from BOTH sides.) All in all, this is a true bargain.Pro's:","Pro's:

The one I originally ordered was out of stock and unavailable for 6 weeks. This was close in size and price so I went with it. Glad I did. This is a very nice gazebo. A few things to note. This gazebo comes in four (4) boxes. I got three on the day I was promised. I was unaware that there was a forth box until I laid out all the parts and discovered I was missing the roof panels. I contacted Customer Service and they replied immediately that the fourth box was actually close by and would be delivered the next day. It was. I didn't know how many boxes were in the shipment. If you're not going to assemble this right away, you may not know you are missing a box until much later. NOTE TO SELF: FOUR (4) BOXES)The first thing I did was pull out the assembly instructions and was horrified to learn that there was no writing . Just pictures. They looked complicated and I feared the worst. In reality, the instructions were easy to follow, well illustrated and I didn't have to deal with writing that was done by someone in China who took a semester of English in the 8th grade.I read a lot of reviews that said this requires 2 or 3 people to assemble. I assembled the entire gazebo with the exception of the roof panels by myself (I'm 67).Things you need to know: This gazebo needs to be on a base of either concrete pad or a wood deck. I built a ground level deck for mine . I made the deck a foot longer and a foot wider than the gazebo.If you are working alone, Assemble the four legs and rectangular frame upside down. When all four legs are on the frame, tip it over and do the rest standing up.As with most things I do, I assembled mine during a heat wave. Although I live in Maine, it was in the mid nineties on the days I built this. My yard has no shade whatsoever. If you are assembling this in the direct sun, put up a canopy of have a garden hose handy. The parts get incredibly hot. If you don't cool the parts or keep them shaded, handling will be a problem. I misted the parts with the hose. Worked great.I've read review that said some holes don't line up. They do. If you are having a hard time lining up holes, check the instructions again. You are likely doing something wrong.Most of the screws go into threaded brass inserts. Make sure your screw is threaded properly before driving it home. If you cross thread or if you over tighten, the brass insert will spin in the hole and you won't be able to tighten it or remove it. Take your time.I read reviews that said the roof leaks. Within three days of completing mine, a tropical storm came barreling through. I feared the worst. Wind speed got to 50mph and the rain was torrential and driving. I actually went out to check on the gazebo. It held strong and not a drop of rain entered through the roof. Take your time, follow the instructions. If the roof is assembled properly it is water tight. I'll be interested to see how it does with a snow load this winter. **You will need a second person, and a second step ladder to put the roof panels up**The gazebo comes with 12 wedge anchors. These are great for concrete but if you are securing to a wood deck they wont work. I used 2 1/2"" galvanized deck screws. In hindsight, had I know about this, I would have added blocks under the deck where each leg lands. Since my deck was built before I got the gazebo it was too late. I did buy some galvanized twisted cable and some eyebolts. I drove the lag eyebolts into the deck frame, ran the cable around each leg and secured with a galvanized wire rope clip. Not real pretty by if I get a big storm it will keep it from ending up in the trees across the street.The only issue I had with the instructions was about the curtains. They come with a Velcro tie to secure them to each post. I still don't know how those work but I've got them to hold back the curtains. Be aware that each curtain covers 1/2 side. It's a little confusing at first but you can close in any part or all of the gazebo with the curtain and / or net.In summary, we have tried all kinds of things to shade our yard. Canopies, Huge 12' umbrellas etc. None really did the job. I was hesitant to part with $1400 for an experiment but it turned out great. This gazebo provides shade wherever and whenever you need it. The roof is well ventilated and it' very comfortable to sit out under it. It is my wife's ""go to place"". It was a good buy. If you're looking for some shade, you won't go wrong with this gazebo.I read one comment that was saying it was not sturdy. I don�t agree. When you are assembling it each part seems weak and if you don�t be careful you might even break them (I almost did one), but when you assemble them all , the whole structure becomes heavy and sturdy. Well, I should mention that I screwed the post bases to my on ground deck.I bought it during Black Friday 2019 deals and assembled it with 10% help and it took me one day and half. I framed it upside down by myself and then flipped it over to assemble the roof with a little bit help that I got. I don�t recommend it though. 3 person should be assemble this in 4-5 hours I would say.I used power tools set. And also got an extension from my garage for the light and outlets.I am very pleased with the quality and look.We Have had rainy/windy days since then (with around 30m/h wind) and it survived with no problem. I always leave all curtains collapsed and fixed to the posts on those windy/rainy days so the wind can go through.I would buy it again. It worth the price.Bought this product due to some of the good reviews. Not disappointed at all. Shipment was earlier than expected. All 4 boxes arrived at the same time. Remember there are 4 boxes to this kit. All boxes arrived with very little to no damage, just some surface breakage. No damage to any of the product.Since the product arrived earlier than expected, the build started earlier too.Took 5 hrs for myself to spread a tarp out (since building on my new resurfaced deck), spread out all the framing parts, inventory them, and build the complete frame. The instructions don't have text on them, but if you look them over carefully and study the parts, it's a piece of cake. At least for me.I stopped at putting the roofing panels on, because it got warm and late in the day.4 days later I put the roof on, by myself (well, wife handed some parts). Here is a small hint when putting the roof panels on. This helped me put them up and keep them up until time to bolt them on. Use the very long 6mm bolts and slide them in at the bottom of the panel, where the regular bolts go through. Just the bolts no nuts, they are there just to keep the panels in place until they are all up on one side. I only put a couple in each panel.. Then put the regulars bolts in with the spacers.I did this with the small top roof section and the large bottom section. Made it a one person job.The roofing part took another 3 hrs, but I was in no hurry. I did need help in getting the bolts and nut tight.Remember don't tighten all bolts until sections are level (uprights and angle brackets), all roofing supports are in, and also wait until all panels are in before getting them tight.Only had one problem with one hole, loosen a few bolts and everything came together.Been using it everyday.I recommend it.I received the unit within a few days. After opening the 4 boxes and calculating the unit to weigh approx 250lbs. I found the instructions for assembly to be excellent. All parts are carfully wrapped and lettered. After arranging all items I put the posts and sections together in 3 hours by myselft with my wife helping to hold the posts. Roof on in another 4 hours. Good idea to put the allen wrench and Phillips head in separate low torque drills. Makes the job much easier. Extremely satisfied with the quality of the unit. Would highly recommend.nanPro's:","Pro's:

Text: White 14x18 wall frame with double white mat opening for a 11x14 image. Airfloat mat adds dimension and depth to your art by creating a shadow effect with a separated double mat feature. Includes two EZ-Hanging Wall Grabber hanging brackets that can be repositioned for vertical or horizontal display and easy-to-use hanging template. Frame is crafted from durable solid wood with easy-open tabs on the back let you load your photos quickly. Lightweight protective glass will keep your favorite photos looking great for yearsThis is a great frame and it worked perfectly for me. I have seen some reviews where people have said that when the cardboard backing is removed to insert your photo that the backing will not fit back into the frame. This is true if you try to simply lay it into the frame but that's the wrong way to do it. There is a groove cut into the inside of the frame. You need to make sure the backing slides into that groove before trying to push it in. If you do this the cardboard backing will slide in perfectly. Hope that helps!Having worked in the framing business for over 20 years I know framing can be very, very expensive. This is an excellent purchase if you want something really nice and not pay crazy money!The frame is well made as is the double mat; perfectly beveled with no over cuts. It also came very well packaged with corner protectors and a mile of bubble wrap in a heavy duty corrugated box.Yes you can get a cheesy frame and mat cheaper but I have to say this is quite lovely and excellent quality. ??When I obtained my treasured Ongo Gablogian Print from my son-law I knew I had to have the perfect frame to capture the power of his presence. This frame features reflective real glass with a nice black-background dual layer matt. It feels substantial and looks great. The stepped corner plastic hanging hardware is unusual and somewhat questionable (BYO Nails) - but worked fine so far and allowed leveling.Ongo can't be contained in just any frame. His energy and sheer raw power have captured the hearts and minds of the art world since he crashed the scene in 2016, and I knew instantly that the unique and very rare print required the special care that only this frame could provide. Every morning as I stand before this shrine, lid up - I gaze upon his countenance and prepare to face the day - stronger and wiser from merely having glimpsed his image. I can only imagine what his wistful gaze is pondering upon...silent...and alone...I bought these for my house and again for a gift. My rating is based on the item itself and not the packaging. The wood is a pretty Brazilian cherry style appearance. The mat is an egg shell white and cut at a bevel. The �kick stand� in the back is well structured so the picture stands up well with a slight angle. If you plan to give as a gift, please note that the cardboard box it comes in looks like it had been through World War II in both of my separate purchases. When I gave it as a gift, I had to take it out of the box it came in and place into something more presentable.My youngest served 4 years in the Navy and just graduated college. I needed a double 5x7 frame (far right). This frame completed my Wall of Pride. Three college graduates, one also a vet! It is a high quality frame and was a perfect fit for my needs. Thank you for offering this frame at a great price and quick shipping!Pro's:","Pro's:

I usually get the 14 16 18 20 , and I�ve never had a problem with it. And as a working girl and college girl I need affordable hair that will last through a sew in. These pictures are of my hair when I got it installed and when it was straighten . I prefer the hair to be either straight or curled with flexi rods because the natural body wave texture kinda fades away once you wash it. The body wave texture when you get the hair is pretty tho. Overall I give this hair a strong 8.5/10.Received my unit in a timely manner and it came with a wig grip, wig cap, and edge brush which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered a 20in and it looks like a 16in unit even though it came in a bag that stated 20in. But I'll make it work...2.25.21Had to update my review. Hair is soft but a little thin. Straightens well but better to keep curls in it. My stylist measured it and it wasn't the 20' I purchased. It does color well and I've experienced minimal tangles. It does shed a bit.This wig looked nothing like the pic. It was so horrible I had to cut and style it myself. It also shed badly and you cannot part it on the side or anything. This is notnpre plucked and the baby hair was a joke. They offer $20 refund for 5 star reviews. I don't care about the refund I was suckered in by the reviews, but I should have looked at the videos.This hair is the best hair I ever bought. If anyone looking for Brazilian body wave search no more Gabrielle Brazilian is the best hair it does not she'd are tangled very soft. I'll order again . I strongly recommend.First things first, my expectations were not high for this hair given what I paid. That said, it's decent hair for the price but feels like any other human hair you can purchase for your local beauty supply. Its most definitely NOT virgin hair, NOT unprocessed and tangles very easily. It had a strong smell when I first got the hair that did not go away until I co-washed a second time. I also got what appeared to be a dye stream when I washed both times.I don't mind its natural texture and once it's completely dry it does have a little more ""body"".

We both need a desk to work but really didn't have room for two separate desks. This was a perfect solution. I love that it includes a bookshelf because saving space is a priority to me. The desk is made of good quality, heavy, sturdy materials and the instructions were easy to follow. 10/10, I recommend this desk to anyone who wants a sturdy, space saving desk on a budget.I worked on putting this double desk together by myself which is near impossible. I had to do it upside down while it rested on a couch on one side and a chair on the other. As I put in the desk pieces and then the bookshelves to hold the desk pieces, the screw holes were either too tight or too loose or wouldn't completely tighten. Then when I put the leg pieces on the white plastic piece already in the hole broke off when screwing in the legs. That was awful and I had to use the extra pieces they gave which weren't broken which shows they anticipate an issue. Then when I turned over the product, the legs ripped from the desk pieces. At this point the product was destroyed and couldn't be use for my 2 boys who are 8.5 and 6 for their virtual learning. I couldn't return the desk because it was too heavy to even lift or to disassemble and carry down and so I simply gave up and lost the $ which is not fair. I do no recommend this product.nannannanPro's:","Pro's:

Text: NEW FLAVOR: Athletes everywhere are shouting YABBA DABBA DOO! with the launch of two new Dymatize ISO100 protein powder flavors � Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Pebbles. 1.6 lbs of Dymatize ISO100 Fruity Pebbles Protein Powder (23 Servings). 25 grams of protein, which includes 5.5 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), & 2.6 grams of Leucine per serving. Zero grams of fat and less than 1 gram of sugar per serving.. Scientifically formulated with fast-digesting hydrolyzed whey protein isolate. If your goal is gains in muscle size and strength, ISO100 is your perfect partnerI was really kinda scared to taste this. I mean, Fruity Pebbles Protein Shake??? A healthy version of my favorite sugar filled breakfast cereal??? Not to mention that I had to switch to Almond Milk recently, and I already knew I didn't really care for that. But, I bought it anyways. I made one and tried really hard to get my husband or my daughter or anyone else to test it for me, but they refused. So, I took a deep breath and took a drink. Mind blown! Reminds me of drinking the milk after eating a bowl of Fruity Pebbles! And it doesn't have that powder residue aftertaste that some protein shakes tend to have. I can have my sugar breakfast packed with protein, without the sugar and carbs! I'm thrilled! I'll be buying the Cocoa Pebbles next.In a lot of the reviews, it has people stating that Fruity Pebbles is sooo good and it's the best flavor. I was skeptical. I stuck to other flavors...always getting tired of them after about a week...always having to add things to them just to tolerate them. But not Fruit Pebbles! It's just like drinking the milk after a bowl of most fruity cereals. It never gets old. And when it's cold, i can drink it all day if i had to. You could mix it in with your milk when you eat fruity cereals. At this point, i don't plan on drinking any other flavor ever again.The flavor definitely tastes just like Fruity Pebbles! No weird aftertaste either. My only small complaint is that mixing one scoop with just 6oz of liquid (I use cashew almond milk blend) is a little unsatisfying in quantity (it did satisfy my hunger, just wham bam - done). I decided to try mixing the powder with 6oz of plain Greek yogurt instead, and it's SO GOOD! It tastes like a treat and there's a little more opportunity to savor the flavor.HOLY. COW. I had a gastric bypass RNY two years ago, and protein shakes are still something that I fall back on frequently when I'm too busy or too lazy to think about food in a more proactive way. My husband (who just likes protein shakes, no bariatric surgery for him) and I were getting SO. BORED. of chocolate and vanilla flavors. It's actually surprisingly difficult to find protein powders with a good protein/carb ratio, and 90% of the market is flooded with vanilla and protein. All we needed to see for this product were the carb count, and the magical words ""Fruity pebbles"".So let's cut to the chase. The 1.6 pound tub came in last week, and we are now talking about ordering the 5 pound tub because WOW. Not only is this an easy and good thing for me as a bariatric patient to consume, but it TASTES. SO. GOOD. I can't taste ANY of the normal ""protein-y"" flavor. I'm not waking up in the morning saying ""ugh, no time for eggs, I guess I'll have a protein shake"". I'm waking up, and I'm excited for my protein shake, which is better than the eggs because I can actually finish 25 g of protein in a shake, but not in eggs.We're going to be recording, and trying new flavors too. So. Excited.I've tried brand after brand because either the protein powder is too sweet, causes horrible GI issues, makes me sick, or it just tastes terrible. I even started to try unflavored, but I still had issues. I ran across ISO 100 fruity pebbles & decided to give it a try. This is hands down the best protein powder I've ever tasted! I'm still in shock! It's not too sweet, zero clumps/ blends extremely well, didn't cause GI issues and tastes just like fruity pebbles cereal milk. The sodium/ potassium amounts are low, which is amazing for me. I've mixed it with plain water & half water/ half almond milk. I do prefer the latter, but both methods have a great outcome.I've lost a lot of muscle due to my protein intake being less than what it should be, so I definitely needed this. For the first time, I had 2 shakes yesterday & powered through my workout. It'll take time to get to where I want to be, but I'm very happy with this purchase! My kid even likes this one!Pro's:","Pro's:

Vehicle drives on hard surfaces, grass and other rough terrain. Parent-controlled, high-speed lock out and Power-Lock brakes. For preschool kids ages 3-7 years, max. weight 65 lb (29.5 kg)Bought this for my 3 year old and she absolutely loves it! It was very easy to put together and I�m definitely going to buy another for my other daughter.Ordered this one for my daughter because it had 2 speeds. Assembly was fairly easy. Took more time to put on the stickers than anything. Awesome product. She is loving it, its pretty quick and the battery life seems to be great. A great buyMy daughter got this for her 4th birthday and she hasn�t gotten it into the fast mode yet and is still perfectly content. Great value for the money compared to the other ones I�ve purchbased it is much more bang for your buck. It�s a little faster and seems to get around the yard betterI bought power wheels brand because they've been around forever. That being said, I was really let down. Assembly was not a problem at all. About fifteen minutes and it's good to go(after the initial 18 hour battery charge). But there is even less metal then there used to be. Everything is good being plastic but all the steering and major moving parts should be a little more solid. The wheels are often pointing out when the handlebar is straight. Plastic doesn't hold up to kids steering things. My 3 and 4 year old both have one and the batteries take about 30 minutes to drain on high speed and an hour tops on low speed. The bad thing is, when they go outside to start the day, they ride for a half hour/hour and then they die. Next chance to ride them is 14 hours later because that's what it takes to charge the battery. I know I could buy ten batteries but that's not good math. Might as well but a gas powered Polaris for the price after buying enough batteries. They get around good, the speed settings are great(you can lock out high speed until the kids are trained), they fit my kids great. Downfalls- battery life is pretty short considering where the world is with batteries, the batteries take 14 hours to charge and the wheels/steering is not a long lasting set-up. Very cheap components that will not hold up very long.My daughter loves it.. the speed is actually pretty good, can speed alittle faster tooPro's:","Pro's:

Text: OUTPERFORMS FIBERGLASS, WASHABLE AND NON-ELECTROSTATIC 3-month pleated 1 in. home air filters for your furnace, air conditioner or HVAC system. DESIGNED WITH EXCLUSIVE Filtrete Brand 3-in-1 technology from 3M to trap unwanted air particles while letting cleaner air flow through. ATTRACTS AND CAPTURES microscopic particles such as smoke, cough and sneeze debris, bacteria and viruses - and large particles, including lint, household dust and pollen. 1550 MPR has a rating of MERV 12. The higher the MPR, the more microparticles - such as pollen, pet dander, smoke, bacteria and viruses - your filter will capture from the air passing through it. 54% SMALL PARTICLE CAPTURE, like bacteria and particles that carry viruses ( % captured is based on ASHRAE 52.2 testing for 0.3 to 1 micron particles from the air passing through the filter, which relates to HVAC industry standard efficiency testing). CERTIFIED as asthma & allergy friendly (As outlined in report ASCR: 1246-01)This product is not as advertised. The product description says 19 1/2� tall and product specs say 19.9�. For those at Filtrete 19 1/2� is 19.5� not 19.9�. The product is slim and that is something I can live with however being so short to the point air and particles can (and will) just go over it is worthless. For others benefit this product is 19.5� tall.Also, �slim� is a modifier to describe thickness. Not overall dimensions, that would be �compact�.This is specifically for certain units that are not actually 20x25x4. Don�t bother with the descriptions for this product because they are contradictory.I gave these 5 stars because it is a great filter. Just make sure you measure correctly before ordering these. I ordered these 20x25x4 filters, but they didn't fit my furnace. I actually needed the 20x25x4 ""SLIM FIT"" ones which are just SLIGHTLY smaller in all dimensions. Why HVAC companies would make two different versions of a 20x25x4 filter is beyond me.I just received these filters today and I don't have anything to review for the Quality but, I wanted to share the dimensions of the 20x25x4 Filter with photographs. Here are the actual dimensions right out of the box. I purchased them for my Honeywell Filter Housing and they fit nicely.This review is for the 20x20x4 2 pack.Perfect replacement for my HVAC unit. Our house's previous owners had the Filtrete Micro Allergen Defense (https://www.amazon.com/Filtrete-Allergen-Guaranteed-Captures-Particles/dp/B00L3SJLEO) version installed. I opted to spend the ~$10 for the two-pack to upgrade to this version with the hopes that it will help with my seasonal allergies that have started up recently (no word on that yet, just installed today).Note that the dimensions of the filter listed in the product detail (19 15/16 x 19 15/16 x 4 3/8) here on Amazon are incorrect. The size is listed on the filter box itself as 19 7/8 x 19 7/8 x 4 5/16. Also, this filter has a MERV rating of 12, also listed on the filter box, but not listed in the product detail.In Amazon's listing at the first bullet point it shows ""Actual Filter Size: 15 3/4 x 24 7/8 x 4 3/8 Inches."" On the final bullet point it shows"" Actual size(inches):15 7/8(length) x 24 5/8(width) x 4 3/8(depth)"". However the product�s packaging says its actual size is 15 7/8 x 24 9/16 x 4 5/16. Fortunately it fit just fine in my Honeywell system. Just be aware of the variance in listed actual dimensions and the actual actual dimensions. It's hard enough to pick the right filter when the are two sizes for the 16 x 25 x 4 filter (normal and slim fit) and Amazon just makes it harder by not providing correct or even consistent dimensions. Three star due to the added frustration.Pro's:","Pro's:

Assembly requiredThese are VERY well made, solid wood and easy to assemble. The seat is thicker than some stools and the edges do not have cut off sharp edges. They don�t cut into your backs of your legs. This ismy second set. My new puppies chewed the rungs on the first set. Replaced with cheaper stools with metal legs that had the sharp edges. So rebought the good ones. Purchased apple bitters to spray on legs when they started to chew. The others made really nice plant stands !WE originally bought this stool to be a table to hold soaps, bath bubbles, body lotions, etc next to our new Vessel bath tub. It is the same heighth making it easy to reach when you are in the tub. But now we are using ti as a stool next to the tub while the grandkids ""swim"" in our large tub. This table comes unassembled and you have to put together. But it is easy, with great directions and took about 10 - 15 minutes. It looks great, has a nice finish, and the screw plugs work perfect. A great value!These stools are more than I expected. Great workmanship, beautiful too, they will be in our home for a very long time!Look really nice.

Text: The MG06ACA Enterprise Capacity HDD models provides up to 10TB of capacity and 7,200 rpm performance, in a robust design engineered for nearline business-critical workloads.The MG06ACA modeInstalled in my Synology NAS. As I've experienced with past Toshiba drives, NO issues at all. Noise level is good, and the drives perform as intended.On a site note, I have Toshiba drives in my older Synology NAS from 2014 and none of them have failed yet after 8 years of nonstop service. This is why I believe in Toshiba drives.In my experienced WD and Seagate are crap. I've had so many hit and miss with those drives, or premature failures, that it isn't even funny.This HDD works pretty good as a server HDD and I even tried it as a storage unit for my games on my desktop. Great for games and works pretty fast since it can also be used for a desktop PC except the holes are in a different area but not a big deal for me. I securely mounted it on my PC so it fits well. I guess when it comes to storage space Toshiba lives up to the name of being dependable and durable.I have two of these in a RAID enclosure. I don't want to say that they're noisy but I can't hear the cooling fan over the clunking of the drives. We'll see if that settles down a bit after the RAID array is finished building but at this point they are on the verge of being returned.This was very easy to install. The storage is exactly ?? %It is a good buy .And am happy this was introduce to me buy a friend..I bough 4 drives over two orders. One of the drives failed after a couple of months. I contacted the seller and they flatly refused to replace the drive - they told me to contact Toshiba, which I did. Only one problem, the drives sold by this seller are not retail drives so in order to claim the warranty they have to be honoured by the seller and not by a end customer. luckily I was able to return the drive to Amazon as it was within their six month warranty period. If any of the other three drives fail after six months I'm f****d...So buy from this seller t your own risk.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 100% Cotton Canvas Curtain Panels With Reverse Back Tab Top.. Each set contains Two Cotton Slub Textured tab top window curtain panels, each measuring 50"" x 108"". QUALITY GUARANTEED: Customer satisfaction is of utmost importance to us. We're confident you'll love our products, but if you're not 100% SATISFIED, our customer service team will work with you to make it right!. Making of curtains: 100% Pure Cotton Slub Textured fabric curtain panel with a reverse tab construction. No hooks or rings required. Panel slide easily onto curtain rod.. Best USE: Decorating for the French Country style, modern farmhouse style, rustic/country style, for Christmas, Thanksgiving day, family party, picnic party. Also you can hang up for your kitchen window, or your breakfast nook, or decorate your living room with buffalo check pattern curtain, special, classic and modern farmhouse style would get tons of compliments.. Care Details : Machine wash colors separately wash in cold water, gentle cycle, tumble dry low, low iron.I bought several types of curtains to test them out. These are PERFECT! The combination of the texture, the way they hang (not too thick, not too thin) and the privacy factor while still letting light in. These aren�t blackout, but just light filtering. They are perfect! One thing I recommend is getting rings to hang them it makes opening and closing so much easier and allows them to bunch tighter when the curtains are open. Plus, if your curtains are an inch or two too high, adding the clips will help lengthen them.When I tell you these curtains changed my mood instantly, I am being serious. 2020 has been hard on a lot of us. I�ve been stuck inside with 3 kids for an entire year so I started changing some things around the house. In our kitchen we had dark brown black out curtains and it looked like a dungeon, no light came in so I decided to go the opposite and order these beautiful white ones. We only got two panels for our sliding glass door so they are a bit sheer but that�s how I like it. Our kiddos painted our glass doors to look kind of like stain glass and I love that I can see it behind the curtains. Light comes in without direct sunlight beaming through. They are perfect and literally made me smile the instant they went up. The kitchen seems bigger and it�s definitely brighter. Adding two more would make it less sheer if that�s what you�re going for. We do need to hang them a little higher as I ordered really long ones to make room appear bigger but I didn�t hang them high enough so there�s extra fabric on ground. 100% recommendWhite linen look - have searched for a long time for good weight and affordability of linen curtains.These exceeded my expectations, bought 3 sets. They arrived very well boxed and packaged.*All the same length, width and no variation in color at all - White*Very good quality material and stitching.*didn't even have to iron them!* Look great over our new 1"" rods using the back tabs on the drapes.*Very modern, sophisticated look.*Weight is perfect, not heavy but not flimsy - medium sheer, and can't really see through them at all. Linen is beautiful texture for the rooms - used in dining and living.Usually I buy lined drapes, but these simply don't need a lining.(I always buy 96"" length so I can hang rod higher to today's modern look - ( they are still long and puddled on the floor, so I washed one to see if they shrinks - it did and now hits the floor at exact length needed! I will wash them all - delicate wash, cold, hung over banister to dry, no dryer - easy to iron.)Highly recommendI ordered a pair of cotton slub curtains from another vendor that had a lovely linen texture in them, but when I went to reorder them they were out of stock. I order several other cotton slub curtains that had more of a canvas texture, not the linen look I was after. I was so happy when these curtains came in and they were exactly what I was looking for. These look like curtains from Pottery Barn or West Elm, at a fraction of the price. Highly recommend!Love these curtains. They are not too heavy as I needed them to hang on a magnetic rod on a door. They are not a black out curtain but you cannot see thru them. Just what was needed. Washes very well and still keeps its shape.Pro's:","Pro's:

AIR-VENTDE ROOF: A 2 tier dacron canopy top with mesh netting fabric and gradient roof; The double roof garden tent is vented for optimum airflow and comfort in windy weather also conducive to drainage in rainy days. ADJUSTABLE NETTING: The black mesh walls open on 2 sides of the four-sided gazebo which keep insects out also work well in ventilation and visibility; You can adjust the coverage and tie it with velcro straps and enjoy full angle scenery.

SPACIOUS SPACE: YITAHOME double roof outdoor canopy gazebo looks great in backyard, terrace, lawn, courtyard and other outdoor spaces; The gazebo for patio 10'x10' is spacious enough to accommodate more people for parties; enjoy a relaxing time with your friends and familyAmazing value (paid less than $300).More sturdy than I was expecting for the low price point.I�ve only had it for a few weeks, and will likely remove the top covering if heavy winds are expected (+20 mph), but I�d expect it�s going to hold up well to normal elements.It takes a little bit of assembly time but when done, it looks very nice. I had a problem with a bracket but the company was very responsive and the problem has been satisfactory resolved. I am very happy with the purchase and I will not hesitate to do business with this company.I'm female, not particularly strong, and not particularly tall. I wanted this for my back deck, which is a little bigger than the dimensions listed, so that worked out. I was able to assemble almost everything solo (except the top), which was nice, but I recommend using an Allen bit in a power drill or electric screwdriver or you'll give yourself carpel tunnel syndrome. Because I didn't put it on the ground, where it is clearly meant to be constructed, I knew it would be more vulnerable to wind. For that reason, I supported each side with a vertical 2x4 from the deck to the crossbar above. This seemed to make a difference. I also bolted down the frame to my deck at each corner and each two by four. Everything went together swimmingly and looked lovely all summer, holding up against storms and rain and the cross bars even held up some plant hangers, since they were bolted down and supported by 2�4s. All in all, a lovely back deck experience.We're about 9 months in now and things have started to go south. The frame is sound. A few lose bolts here and there, but VERY few, really fixed. That ""soft, fabric canopy"", though? It's toast. Simply did not hold through the late fall/early winter storms in Tennessee. No actual tornados here, just admittedly very, very high winds. And it didn't come apart at the seams. It just ripped to shreds. I'm going to have to replace it. Sad, but not insurmountable, so I'm sticking with my four stars since the last canopy I tried this with actually collapsed into the back deck.We had a lot of trouble with canopy topMy deck tent held up under 75 mile an hour winds. The canopy got some tears but it held up better than I thought.Pro's:","Pro's:

USES LESS HTH CHLORINE: These compressed, virtually hands-free pool treatment tablets contain the minimum amount of dangerous components and active minerals needed to keep your pool or spa water crystal clear. You may continue to check and control the alkaline levels with normal pH testing strips, as they will still detect the amount of chlorine dioxide in the water. Using these low-level chlorine tablets is also the ideal solution for preventing chlorine-related skin irritation.. KEEPS POOLS CLEAN: Our pool and spa chlorine tablets enter the purification cycle quickly, keeping the water sparkling clean. Keep your pool in tip-top condition with EcoOne tablets from Pacific Sands.. PERFECT FOR ALL POOLS: EcoOne pool tablets are compatible with all pool types.

You will never have to worry about stepping on leftover tablet pieces or finding floating bits of chemical. EcoOne has done the worrying for you, taking pool care to the next level by keeping it natural, with effective yet minimal components and the most efficient delivery system.I won't use anything else in my spa!! I had tried being the mad scientist when I first got my spa only to end up draining my spa and refilling it several times. This only caused my water bill and my blood pressure to increase. I never seemed to be able to get the pH mixture and the total hardness vs the total alk not to mention the bromine to all line up at the same time and when and if I ever did it is a fine line! If you didn't stay on it you lost it! I love my spa and I workout and after a good work out there is nothing like a good soak! I noticed that my skin started reacting to the chemicals that I had been using so I wanted to go more natural, hence ECOONE. Once a month I put in SPA MONTHLY and every day one of these ONESHOCK tablets. I won't use anything else. No more skin issues. No more Mad scientist!I was looking for something less harsh on our skin. Didn�t wanna use string chemicals for giant pools !!!!I ran into this product . Works perfect for my above ground pool . It holds 900 gallonsI have maybe have around 830 gallons in it.I also bought the ecoone ph down and ph up along with it .My pool water is in perfect range . At first my test strips didn�t read free chlorine since the levels were so low from a big BBQ so I added 6 tablets . Boom! Levels came even with total chlorine .Works perfect for small pools or above ground pools .Update: So this was the kids second time getting in the pool after using these tablets this time I only use two and the chlorine levels were perfect these tablets will last me all seasonI got my first hot tub in 1997. The chemicals were always a challenge and very costly with a variety of chemicals to keep the water just right. However, after finding these tablets, it is much easier. These are about all I use and, although, it says to use one a day, I have found that, with the size of my tub, I can go every other day and sometimes skip two days and the chlorine level is fine.This product is excellent!! We use it combined with the Ecoone monthly cleaner and our hot tub stays clean, balanced and the water isn�t harsh or chemical-y even with constant use. Highly recommend!This is a great product that keeps the spa water crystal clean and clear. I highly recommend it.Pro's:","Pro's:

And you can also use this tent for backyard barbecue with your friends, or the canopy tent is the best choice for your birthday party as well.Last minute order to help accommodate higher number than expected guests for a family dinner. My husband and older son set up the tent in the morning in 45min to be ready for the evening. We decorated with clear Christ.as lights. Later a cold front came in unexpectedly and it dropped into the 40s with drizzle and it was windy. My husband reinforced with extra white tape. We didn't expect to hold up, but it did. We were pleasantly surprised. The guests loved it. Guests were comfortable and the wind and drizzle was kept out. It seems we can still get a few more uses out of it.This takes 2 or more people to set up, but is worth it. The frame is sturdy and each side is put on with shower curtain ring like pieces the roll & secure with Velcro. There was a small hole in the window which was a little disappointing, but we kept it anyway. It secures with small stakes, but we ordered additional weights so we can put it on concrete if necessary. We liked it so well, we ordered a second one for added space for out door get togethers, yard sales and our annual Halloween carnival themed big too.Perfect for baby showerAwesome buy. Way cheaper than renting one. However, what a pain in the a$$ to put together. I recommend having a minimum of 3 to 4 people (taller people) to help raise it. Not all parts fit to specs but for the most part it did the job and provided a great atmosphere. I suggest buying tent weights because this tent will take off on you with a big enough gust and I don't think the provided steaks will hold up.This tent has held up as a ""performance tent"" for my students for 3 outdoor concerts in my backyard. It looks nice and professional. I had read many reviews about the plastic ripping easily on the first use, the metal poles bending easily, but this hasn't been our experience. [We have been extra careful after reading the bad reviews.] We keep several pole groups pre-assembled for ease of setup, and carefully pack away the tent plastic sides. We've had 6 ppl to setup for 2 concerts, but only 3 this last Sunday, and that went surprisingly well. It was windy [10-12mph] on Sunday, and the tent was being pushed at an angle!! We had used 8 sandbags to secure, and that saved it from being blown over!! I had tent spikes, but forgot to use them. That would've been great to add, and I will for all future builds. This tent has been much better than expected and well worth the money, esp since outdoor concerts are the only way my students can perform with pandemic protocol still in place for my studio.Pro's:","Pro's:

Application: LED replacement bulbs for RV tail lights, brake lights, backup lights, side marker lights, tail lights, brake lights, backup lights and indoor camper light bulbs.Bought these as a gift for someone after spending some time with them in their trailer while hunting.... I noticed how dim the lighting was compared to my ( newer led ) trailer. I bought these as a gift. I believe the response was "" wow awesome I have seen the light !!"". Installation was apparently easy and straight forward and it made a huge improvement over the old incandescent lights. Hopefully these will also run cooler keeping the covers from melting over time ( as was the issue with incandescent ).Makes a huge difference in our RV!! Looks at pics!! Pic on left is old light, right side in new Led- they also don�t get near as hot as the old ones.These are great replacements for the foot well, backup, trunk, under hood and license plate lights on my 1970 and 1971 Buicks. I have not had one fail yet but it has only been a few weeks.In the picture, left is new, old is right.Wow what a difference in the lighting output in our RV. These are a lot brighter than the LED's I bought from another seller few years back. It definitely helps to upgrade every few years to a newer and better bulb. These are a white color and they maybe too white for some people. I would suggest that if white isn't the color you are looking for in your RV, go with a soft white LED.I replaced all my bulbs in the camper with these. What a difference they made. Just one old bulb probably pulled more power than all 19 of these leds. Everyone worked flawless and gives off a more natural white light. This in return makes the camper feel much more welcoming. I will be purchasing another set for replacements as needed thorough out their use.Pro's:","Pro's:

The exact mat opening size is 10.5��x13.5�� which is more proper to hold an 11x14 photo securely.. ?Reliable Material?These light-weight picture frames are eco-friendly and economical. With safer shatter-resistant plexiglass front that protects picture from dust and moisture.(Wipe the frame with wet tissue or rag before use to make it look more beautiful on the wall.). ?Extensive Uses?The 12 by 16 frame is attractive decor for home, office, photo studio, art gallery, exhibition hall. Sweet gift for family and friends on Christmas, anniversary, wedding, birthday and other occasions.. ?Secure Packaging?Set of 3 12x16 poster frame were packaged well with foam corner protection & plastic sealing. Protective packaging ensures safe delivery and avoids receiving damaged products.This review is for Sindcom 12x16 Picture Frame 3 Pack, with Detachable Mat for 11x14 Pictures. I got 3 frames for $18.69. Honestly didn't expect too much when the price breakdown is a little over $6 a piece. I think they're nice. I bought them as an inexpensive way to display kids' artwork. The frame feels sturdy. The backing is similar to what you get on a cheap bookshelf kit you put together yourself - thicker than cardboard. The plexiglass film came off very easy and didn't create a lot of static cling. The plexiglass looks like real glass until you touch it. Mine were shrink-wrapped together with Styrofoam on the corners. No scratches, dings, dents or cracks. Very pleased.This frame size is perfect for my growing number of diamond dot paintings. The clasps are easy to open and close, the backing is sturdy and the frame itself looks great. And there are 3 frames for a reasonable price.I needed sturdy inexpensive frames for some water color posters I made for school. I had not planned on framing them (was planning on laminating them but didn't want to spoil the watercolor look) so was pleased that the 11 x15 watercolor paper would fit this 12 x 16 frame which came with a nice mat as well (which although I did not use on top because my paintings went edge to edge - would definitely plan for another time). I was actually pleased with the plexiglass (which comes with a two sided protective sheet) as it is safer than glass in my busy classroom. I didn't read the description to realize that is what I was ordering - so I wouldn't complain. The back of the frame was not only easy to use but well constructed. I ordered 4 sets of them and they arrived in good condition. If you are looking for a glass picture frame or have high quality art/photos you want to frame- go to a frame shop. I am pleased how they work for this project.I like these frames because they are inexpensive yet nicely designed. I bought a couple of artist's prints at a local art fair. I didn't want to take them to get professionally framed because it didn't seem cost effective. These were the perfect solution. They come well protected from shipping damage. They are easy to unwrap and use. They aren't what I would call ""sturdy,"" but they aren't ""flimsy"" either. Sort of in between; probably because they are so lightweight. I like these frames. They look good around my art prints, and hang nicely on the wall without needing a heavy duty hanger. Highly recommend.Fast shipping, perfect fit for the 30X40cm Diamond Art projects. the matting is greatPro's:","Pro's:

Looks great.perfect for my 16x20 poster.The packaging for this frame was so well thought out that I had no worry of damage on the frame. However, as I opened it I discovered that the back was literally a piece of cardboard. Do yourself a favor and skip this frame. I don't understand why they cut a corner and put a weak piece of cardboard as the back. I kept it but I was really disappointed in the quality because of the cardboard back. I had to use my own hanging hardware and drill it into the frame because I didn't trust their hardware since they cut corners on the back w/ a flimsy piece of cardboard. I will say it one more time: a piece of this frame is the side of a cardboard box.Great that they put this sticker on the side of the plexiglass that has no cover. Now I�m going to spend 10 minutes peeling and end up with a scratched piece of plexi. Definitely would not purchasePro's:","Pro's:

Search B07QXP4ZTL for the mosquito netting fit with.Sweeeeeeeeeeeeet gazebo! I put it together by myself but I probably could've used another person at least. Had to use a ladder to hold up the sides pieces while I connected them together. Took about 4 hours by myself to do. Some of the holes didn't line up so you've got to put a bit of elbow grease into getting some pieces to fit, but overall, very happy with this purchase. I suggest adding pebble gravel to the columns to weight it down if you're not screwing it into the deck or cement. Makes it super sturdy. Looks fantastic at a great value compared to other gazebos. Added string lights of my own to make it usable at night. Very happy with this purchase.This is one of the most cheaply made, and poorly manufactured items I have ever encountered, for $1300. The corner frames were really bent right out of the box, missing washers, a roof bracket that was welded on snapped off, and worst of all, the screw holes were completely misaligned, making it impossible to assemble!!!! The screws began stripping, and the gold devices that you screw the screws into, began spinning with each turn of the screw. I wasted a day and a half of my life, partially assembling, then disassembling this product, and repackaging it for a return! Now I have to lug a 150 lb box to ups, to ship it back! I feel like the manufacturer should have to pay me for all of my troubles!!! Ugh! This was a painful, wasteful and expensive learning experience!Perfect patio for our area. Feels a lot cooler under this than our cantilever umbrella or regular under roof patio. The Sunbrella top really knocks down the heat! Definitely took me longer than a few hours with just a little help from my wife, but well worth it. Seems to be made sturdy and should hold up for many years.I had spent about 3 weeks researching different products and manufacturers when I stumbled with this Titan. Box arrived when it should and after taking the instructions out and breezed thru the pages, I knew I had made a great investment. Started to assemble the legs and roof trusses quickly and easily. My wife helped to built the squared frame. The rest of the built was me alone and it took me 3 hours. We had a party that day and guests were marveled at the looks of this thing. It is absolutely gorgeous. Now to find a curtain because, unfortunately the sun's setting hour hits me in the face when sitting under it. I do recommend it overall.Ugh! It's driving us INSANE how water collects on the top. We have tried everything. I'm about to go punch about 8 grommets (one on each section) in where the water collects on the canvas. Hopefully, it will stop most of the mess. We purchased the orange, and I could swear less than 2 months later it has already started fading. It took forever for the guys to get it assembled. No, I wouldn't buy this again for the money. It should be around $500, not $1000. Lesson learned.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Dark brown colored rustproof aluminum frame, which is very strong and sturdy, built with 4.7�x4.7"" triangular aluminum stand pole?much bigger and stronger than standard models. All materials are built to last, never becoming rusty or deformed.. Hard metal top instead of normal fabric or polycarbonate material.. Extremely durable PBV-coated polyester mosquito netting and removable steel railing on 4 sides. Double Track System allows you to add another layer of privacy sidewall. Include 2 layers sidewalls (mosquito set and strong 180gsm polyester solid sidewall). Better ventilated than one layer design. Galvanized steel roof strong enough to withhold heavy snow.. Better water gutter design to ensure rainwater always goes to cornernanLet me start by saying that I absolutely LOVE this product! I like the design and the multiple ways the joints everything were reinforced to make it even more sturdy. My husband and I are used to doing assembly projects like this (and my dad was a contractor who taught me everything!) so this wasn't our first rodeo! We originally purchased a ""package"" to have someone assemble the product after it was delivered to our home. However, within a day or two of ordering, we received an email stating there was no one in our area that could put it together for us --- that actually saved us the additional $352.00 but we for sure then had to assemble it on our own. The following points are meant to be helpful feedback to the manufacturer and tips or ""lessons learned"" to any buyers.You definitely need a minimum of two people for assembly, two 6ft - 8ft A-frame ladders, and patience! We were completely able to assemble this ourselves but it took us a total of about 16 hours (over several different days) to get it all done. With both of us being about 60 yrs. old, the trips up and down the ladders and/or working up over your head can take a toll on knees and shoulders.The picture instructions were adequate but it sure would have been more helpful for them to include at least SOME words or helpful notes on some of the pages. I used one of those folding Allen wrench/Hex Key rubberized hand-held sets -- my hubby used a drill - guess who stripped out more screw heads? (hint --- not me!) Thankfully the manufacturer did include a FEW extra screws in each size needed. Definitely move the assembled posts with cross bar framing to the precise area you want it placed in before assembling the upper roof frame - it's much lighter at that point.IMPORTANT NOTE: You will also need a few ""drift pins"" or ""bull pins"" to help line up the pre-drilled holes, stick the pins into them at various key points, and then start putting in the fasteners. Otherwise, as you work dowNone foundcross the pieces you are joining, the holes may not line up and you have to go back and loosen others so that you can ""slide"" the pieces where you need them. This is especially true when working with the fasteners for the individual metal roofing pieces that overlap each other AND threaded through a rubber ""stopper"" then on through the final frame hole (3 or 4 different holes to line up)!The numerous little metal ""braces"" that you have to attach to every flat section of the metal roofing pieces too easily popped off while sliding them through the roof guides but still were effective in helping lock the roof pieces down when properly aligned.The vented top cap was really easy to install (after putting the first small sections of the metal roof on first). Very thoughtful of the designers to have two of the fasteners being large screw-in hooks so that you can hang something from the hooks in the ceiling (lights or plants or whatever).Again, I really am impressed with the sturdiness (reinforcements) and design of this product. My only ""complaint"" were the ""picture only"" type directions. It really wasn't that hard to assemble --- you ALWAYS need the RIGHT tools to make things go smoother (e.g. bull/drift pins!). And, I love the way it looks and functions on our new concrete patio!My wife and I have been looking for hard top Gazebo and after the reviews went with this one. We are in our 70s so forget about putting this together ourselves. (What a great move) We had the QualTek installers install the gazebo. Oh my it was worth every bit of the $351.27 we paid to have it installed. They came on time at 8am worked to 5pm but had a problem with two of the roof panels N1. I contacted the company and a wonderful customer service rep Stephy Hong got out two panels for me and had them in a couple of days. The installers came back today and finished the job. This gazebo is so sturdy the deck will have to blow away before it moves. The installer had some screws that he used to screw the legs down. We had to bungee cords the corners on the last gazebo so it would not blow away. This comes in two big boxes and the freight company delivered them in our back yard. Can't wait to start using my fantastic gazebo.Just had it up for two days and we had rain and wind and this morning looked at the panel and all four panel were ripped and frayed from the fabric. Don't know what I am going to do now. Emailed the company sent them the picture waiting to see what they are going to do. Whoever thought of those hooks were not thinking long term. The hooks tore right through the curtain with the net. Also the Velcro sticks to the netting. But in the wind the Gazebo did not move one inch. Rain did leak off the sides which I thought would not happen and leaked from the top of the Gazebo onto furniture.Latest update. Never heard from manufacturer on panel or screen so I figured out how to fix it. I reinforced each of the holes with Crystal Clear Gorilla Tape (make sure you read directions). Tape both sides of the panel holes. Then I took off one side of the Velcro strip the one that everything sticks to. I sewed Dretz Sew-On Snaps, snaps are about 3/4 inch so the are nice and big. Then I found ( Magnetic Curtain Tiebacks [Upgrade Verion] Best Curtain Holdbacks, Curtain Tie Backs, Tie Backs Curtain Holdback, Curtain Ties Backs Big Size 18.5 in and Adjust Length Freely - Pack 6 + 4 - Chocolate) on Amazon. These tie backs I wrapped them around the bottom of the panel. This helps hold the panel because the holder they give you keeps slipping down.All in all this is a fantastic Gazebo. Hoping we get many years of enjoyment.Sturdy structure. 12x10 is a perfect size. Construction was slightly difficult. Following directions is important. Must work slowly and methodically. Patience is required. This gazebo compliments any deck or patio. Very happy with this purchase.The predrilled holes are not very accurate, especially in the roof. It is so bad that the screws are unable to fit, so the roof is still unfinished. I�m not sure what I can do to fix this.Pro's:","Pro's:

COMES FULLY ASSEMBLED; Frame will arrive with plexiglass, cardboard backing, and sawtooth hangers. Just pop open the tabs to insert your photo!Be advised that this product is extremely RUSTIC, as in it looks likes it has been �ridden hard and put away wet,� as the cowboys say. There are holes, both knot and nail, and splinters. It�s ROUGH. If you�re hoping for something �country� to go with your rooster collection, this might not be what you�re looking for. Try Hobby Lobby or Michael's. If you have a rural scene (or even better a barn) to frame, this works well. The backing and protective cover are junk, but the quirky frame is actually pretty authentic. Made in USA.Excellent frame. I had searched, compared, and priced barn wood frames for a week before choosing this one. I ordered it specifically for a photo I took of the pond in our city. It is authentic reclaimed barnwood. Complete with old nail holes. There are 2 hangers on it for portrait or landscape orientation. There is plexiglass instead of actual glass. This does not bother me as we have issues with hanging things on the walls in our apartment. Sometimes pictures fall and glass shatters. The plexiglass is clear and doesn't make a difference for me. Will definitely look here when I need another!Wood portion of frame width not as pictured, but does fit description if you read it carefully. Is shipped with a film over the plexiglass so well applied that I could not tell it was there, I thought it was just hideously cheap plexiglass. Was ready to return when I thought I might attempt to see if I could pull up an edge of film in a corner...it took some effort but it DID come up...on both sides, exposing nice quality plexiglass. Wood seems very lightweight but seems substantial enough for my uses. I did not initially believe it was real barn wood, as I have another barn wood frame that is much more substantial than this, but my farmer husband assures me that not all weathered barn wood is as heavy as the other old frame, so I suppose this is authentic, just surprisingly lightweight. It seems a bit overpriced, but does look nice over our stone fireplace in our farmhouse. Would prefer wider wood framing like the picture, but could not find one available in this size with a 3"" wood width.I had an old picture that I had blown up on poster board of my grandfather and Max Baer on the boardwalk in Atlantic City.I couldn�t put it in just any old frame.... this frame replicated the old beach houses in the back ground perfectly.It arrived quickly, with the �weathered� genuine wood look that I was looking for for this particular photo.The poster board was 20x30, so I bought a larger frame, and added a mat.I had no problems securing it, with both the poster board, and the mat added to it.It turned out great, and I am very pleased.Exactly as expected and very unique!This is a beautiful frame for my Daughter's portrait. I've looked everywhere in town and to even come close to this quality, you're looking at well over 100 bucks at Michael's or Joann fabrics. I was worried because I've had some bad product experiences with Amazon, fake reviews, that kind of thing. I think my only gripe is that it doesn't have any hardware to hang it. I'm going to get some so I can install it in my house. Shouldn't cost more than 5-10 bucks though. Over all I'm satisfied, it beat my expectations, not just press board covered in a wood grain sticker, legit light weight distressed wood. Hope that helps! I included pictures too because I hate it when people don't. LolPro's:","Pro's:

It is lightweight with an acrylic front (I bought the 12x24 size.) It is not cheaply made. If I ever have the need again for this size frame I will most definitely buy this one again. I had my picture framed in 5 minutes. I did search for hours before picking this one. Yes, I am picky! The cost was a bit high, although the product is really nice!! It's a keeper.It was okay. That�s all. The cord on the back snapped without me so much as tugging on it but it�s not like I needed it anyway.packed well, no damage on arrival, nice frame but feels flimsy, once fully mounted feels sturdier and should be fine.This frame size is very hard to find, I always hesitate when buying framed items online because half the time they get delivered broken then I have to deal with the broken items return... tedious. This frame arrived double bubble wrapped and the plexiglass was protected on both sides!

Text: Right Handed. Senior Flex Velocity Graphite Shaft. Men's Standard Length: #5=39 Inches: Loft=25 Degrees, #6=38 1/2 Inches: Loft=28 Degrees, #7=38 Inches: Loft=31 Degrees, #8=37 1/2 Inches: Loft=34 degrees, #9=37 Inches: Loft=37 Degrees, PW=36 1/2 Inches Loft=40 degrees. Men's Senior Size Black Pro Velvet GripMy handicap has not dropped but sadly it is the swing not the club. I was shocked at how much I liked the PW. I wasn't sure about it. Swung like a putter it is great for those short shots to the green. Swung like I would normall swing a PW and it gave me a consistent 100 yards. I look forward to playing more with these clubs.Bought these for my husbands birthday after he tried his friends and raved about them.I asked him how he likes them, and in a word he said ""Fantastic"" . He plays 2, 3 times a week.I have played 2 rounds with these clubs...by far the best contact I have ever made with irons. Elevation is great, distance is increased significantly, and solid feel. Highly recommend.I started with the Majek Hybrid Irons which I found solid esp in the 6 7 8 9 irons. I then thought I'd try the Senior all hybrid clubs. After range trips and par 3 to get distance readings, I believe there's a combination of these 2 sets that will do the trick for now. The above have an offset heads which mean for me a my fast swing will pull these and a soft swing will push. Given my findings, I will use the 4,7,8,9,PW of the irons and 5,6 of the above. I never really used the 4 hybrid iron so now it will fit into the mix.Note: any shots where with regular irons I may have ""chunked"" these do glide through and I get a pretty straight ball. No big divots either. Distance has been good to better. My swing is still too quick for pure hybrids but I can see it down the road.These clubs have made hitting the ball much easier. It takes a few rounds to get used to the shape on the lower numbers (8, 9, PW) but they perform very well. The thing I like most is my accuracy has improved greatly and I'm not hitting fat shots near as often. Shot even par on one 9 just last week, hitting the ball close to the hole often. If you're a senior these clubs help. I also can chip with them just like regular clubs and my ball flight is high and soft.Pro's:","Pro's:

Grip feels fine. But for the price, worth a try is you are like me and have trouble with a 3 wood off the deck.I'll revise my review if I see any issues down the line.Hit the club pretty well, leave the 3 & 4 iron home now.This is second one I bought, use this one in Fla.I thought this was a club for an adult, but it is very short.

EASY SNACK OPTION � convenient enough to travel anywhere you go to support your health and fitness goals while on the goThis is my favorite brand of protein bars of all time! I'm slowly trying all of the flavors and will post a rating for each protein bar flavor I have tried below! I love this brand because it hardly tastes like a protein bar, it's like a more dense rice crispy treat! Delicious!#1. Chocolate Crunch. 10/10This is my favorite flavor! Great rich creamy chocolate coating/drizzle. The crunch is slightly dry but if you have it with a glass of water or milk you'll be set!#2. Smores. 9/10Pleasant cinnamon roll/graham cracker taste. Doesn't taste like smores though! Same delicious crunch. Great if you like Cinnamon!#3 Mocha Latte. 9/10Pleasant coffee+creamer taste, not much chocolate flavor going on though! This bar is slightly less dry than the others which was a nice surprise! Same great crunchy texture!Had I realized these contained sucrulose also known as Splenda, I never would of bought these! Sucrulose/Splenda is known to cause cancer & brain tumors just like aspartame dose! They both cause very serious health problems that can lead to death! Do a search & look up the dangers of ingesting both Sucrulose & Aspartame!!! You'll be horrified at what you'll learn about these dangerous chemicals! The sucrulose is processed with chlorine & when sucrulose enters the body it slowly turns into formaldehyde which is imbalming fluid that they put into dead bodies at funeral homes !!! Why companies still use sucrulose & aspartame in foods is horrible!!! Please do the research for yourselves!!! Your life depends upon it!!!I bought the Protein Crisp Bar (Vanilla) - honestly, I bought it because it sounded like an awesome treat. Protein bars are often chewy and to have one that is crispy? I thought that sounded great.And it was! There's very little fiber to these bars but I enjoy the low sugar and high protein. The taste is great too - it's reminiscent of a rice krispy treat but with a little bit of vanilla taste to it. The more you chew it, the more you can get the flavor of protein power but let's be honest, you're eating a protein bar - it's not going to be able to mask what it is forever.I'm really happy with these, though. As a protein bar, they taste nice and the crunch is awesome.I eat a lot of different protein bars and I have to say this is the best tasting one I have had in a while that is in the 200-250 calorie range with at least 20g of protein. I typically rotate from Quest, Cliff Builder, One, Premier Protein, and any other ones I stumble across. It honestly tasted like a Rice Krispies treat with some Reese's peanut butter on it. I also liked that it was bigger than a lot of other similar bars. It is a crisp product so means it will be bigger due to air, but the larger size can make you think you are eating a bit more than you actually are.The manufacturer or seller of this product only advertises 2g sugar, 20g of ""whey"" proteins. When you read the actual package, there is also 6g of sugar alcohol (which is a carbohydrate) and soy protein isolate, rice syrup (which essentially is a sugar), Maltitol Syrup which is a carbohydrate and can raise glycemic index, and artificial flavors. These bars are not high quality and it's insulting to consumers when manufacturers ""hide"" ingredients or do not advertise them properly to the consumer. Either make a healthy Protein bar or don't. Do not try to fool us. Advertise for what it truly is and the consumer can make better choicesPro's:","Pro's:

Text: STANDING DESK WITH KEYBOARD SHELF- Adjustable desk, great for offices with little room that need a narrow standing desk to accommodate. APPEALING DESIGN- Decorative molded side panels hide computer cables and cords. DIMENSIONS- Durable 3/4"" melamine laminate work surface 29 1/2""W x 19 3/4""D, adjustable keyboard 22 3/4""W x 13 1/2""D and 2 lower shelves. STEEL CONSTRUCTION- Steel frame construction with durable powder coat finish. MOBILE DESK- Mobile on four dual wheel carpet casters, two lockingThis desk is compact, sturdy and looks attractive for the price. However, I don't think I understood before purchasing (my own fault, I suppose) that the entirely manual way in which this desk adjusts in height makes it impossible for one person to do alone and, even with assistance, is incredibly inconvenient if you raise and lower regularly to use as both a sitting and standing desk throughout your day/week. Additionally, it's not really sized for a shorter person in the sitting position. I am 5'3"" and it is way too tall for me at the lowest setting, with my desk chair at the highest setting. The keyboard tray is 2"" higher than it needs to be for ergonomic comfort, and the desktop is level with my chest, making it too high to use for writing, and placing my monitors too high as well. I was able to mostly rectify the height issue by removing the casters (wheels), but I still can't use this as a true sit-stand desk since I'm unable to raise it alone. I could have just purchased a nicer regular (sitting) desk for less money. Of course after spending two hours assembling it, at this point I'm not disassembling it and trying to get the pieces packed back up to return. It also weighed a ton. Oh well. Disappointed.I needed a compact standing desk that was wide enough to fit over my treadmill but small enough that I could get around it in a small space. Also, I needed it to be tall enough to accommodate the additional height from me standing on a treadmill rather than standing on the floor. This one is perfect and even fit with the color scheme in my living room. I�m 5�7� and didn�t need to extend it to the tallest height, even with the added height from the treadmill. I didn�t install two of the shelves because I only plan to use the table top surface.Really liked this desk. No it is not adjustable as in ""sit to stand"". You assemble it at one height and probably leave it there. But as a small footprint, low-wobble, everything you need in a standing desk for a great price, I'm very happy.Assembled quickly, supports my dual monitor arms, supports both big screens at my 6' eye level and tucks into a very shallow space. I don't need a convertible desk - this fits what I need perfectly.This desk is exactly what I was looking for. It has a small footprint unlike other desks. It is 29"" wide and doesn't take up a lot of space. The keyboard tray is at the perfect distance ratio to the top shelf. I didn't assemble it but my husband said it wasn't super easy but he did it. I love that I can move it around and it has everything I need. The best part is the small footprint since we have a small place.Functional and not encumbering to our space! Love it!I bought this standing desk two years ago because I read about how unhealthy it is to sit down for long periods of time (which I was doing). Two years later I am still using it and I couldn't be happier. It took a few months to get used to it and now I can't stand sitting down for more than 30 minutes. People look at me like I'm crazy when I tell them that I hate sitting for too long. When I do feel tired of standing (if I've been standing for hours), I just sit for a few minutes and then I am back on my feet again. I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking to reduce the amount of sitting that they do.Note: I use the keyboard shelf for both my keyboard and mouse. It's a bit tight, but I made it work. If you have a big mouse or keyboard both may not fit.Pro's:","Pro's:

We had some pretty big gusts of wind where I held my breathe waiting for them to pass but the tent held up and stayed right where I put it. I used the weighted bags filled with sand and nothing else. It rained a bit on the second day with no leaks. The walls and top were completely dry within 2 hours so I was able to pack it up without wiping it down. Went up and took it down within a few short minutes with two people. Great purchase!This is the ultimate in canopy tents! I love everything about it except 1 thing. It's heavy and you need 1 strong, and tall guy to help put it up. Other than that, it's well made, the side walls are quality, the frame heavy duty, the sandbags durable and it's not at all complicated. It's just not for a 5'3"" old lady to put up by herself.This is a fabulous tent. It is easy enough for me to set up by myself if I need to (I'm 5' 4' and sort of on the delicate side) though it IS a bit heavy for me to transport. The wheels on the outer storage cover are helpful but one spins out of it's axel and needs to be put back in frequently. The fabric is sturdy but not so heavy that it is opaque - in fact the white canopy acts sort of like a light tent on a clear day so that all of the colors in my scarves are easy to see and everything looks bright and fresh. I haven't had to use the side weights yet as the tent stakes themselves have been sturdy enough for me so far. I love that I can have just one or all walls depending on the weather and where my booth is placed in a show.I looked at so many tents before chosing this one. I am so happy with my choice. It is easy to set up (I even manage it alone when needed), it is very sturdy, and the extras like the side panels, the heavy duty wheeled bag, and the included weight bags make this a great deal! At my first market, other vendors were checking it out and couldn't believe how good the quality was and all that was included for the price.The top canopy is very thick and yet it doesn't block out light. It is so bright under the tent! I use the door panel on the back so we can exit easily and get ventilation without having to remove the whole panel. Other vendors have commented on how nice the door panel is. For my first year at the markets, I was thrilled to learn I had chosen a great tent. It is a great package!I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS TENT!!!! I have 2 Rods and 4 fusions in my back, I make Organic Potions and with help, I attend special indoor shows during the ""off"" seasons, but I really wanted to attend outdoor events throughout the season and Beautiful Weather ! What I needed, was a good, strong ""commercial type tent for my outdoor shows. It also had specific criteria it had to meet; fire retardant, waterproof, weights to attach to the legs (in order to keep it from blowing over) and it had to be white. I've been researching tents, a long time now. Searching for the best tent available, reading many, many reviews!! I wanted a sturdy, strong, MADE IN THE USA, White, 10 x 10 tent, so I could attend more out door vendor shows during the spring, summer and fall seasons. In my area, organizers sponsering outdoor shows, require vendors to have a 10 x 10 tent and ALL tents Must meet their safety guidelines. Prior to the opening of their event, all tents are inspected. If they do not meet their specs, vendors have the following options: to rent one of the organizers tents, (if they have them), do without, or loose your booth space and the money paid to rent a booth.After a Very Long Search, I decided on the Eurmax 10 x 10 Ez Pop-Up Canopy Tent!! O M G O S H ! ! I AM SO HAPPY I DID !! It by far Exceeded All my Expectations!!!!First: The Frame is made up of strong, thicker Square steel Pieces, that also has a Very nice powdercoat finish, (keeping it from easily rusting!!) Not the flimsy, thin, alliumin Sissor frames, that I've seen on most all of the other tents. (they must be disposable!!)Second: The Thick, Canvas like material used for the Canopy, and Sidewalls. The Seams are double stitched, and covered!! The parts of the canopy that is placed over each corner of the frame and in the middle of the structure, is DOUBLED THE MATERIAL TO STRENGTHEN IT !AND, ON EACH CORNER THERES ALSO VELCRO not only sewed into the canopy material but where it attaches on the steel posts, the velcro is screwed onto the steel, not just ""stuck"" with tape or glue!!! The Quality of the whole package... is Nothing more than amazing... Oh, another Great part, I think I mentioned to you about my disability... this tent is so well made, that with the help of my Husband, it takes literally minutes to set up! The first time we set it up took less then 4 minutes! and we werent even trying to rush it!! Its so easy to put up, I might even be able to put it up by myself!! LOL!! Thanks You Guys...more than I can say !! I am MORE THAN IMPRESSED, I'm Proud... that the quality and pride of things made in the USA, is still ALIVE & WELL.. Thank You, For the Amazing Product you make and offer at such an Incredible price!!Do I Recommend this to others!?!?! ABSOLUTELY!!!!!

Text: Traditional style; cherry red; wood grain finish. Frame includes: clear acrylic facing, cardboard backing and wire hanging hardware kit (some assembly required). Frame holds a 22 inch by 30 inch photo/print/poster (viewable area is slightly smaller). Frame moulding is 0.75 inches wide; real ash; solid wood. Wood stain and grain is unique to each frame built. Color and pattern may vary.It's good quality and sturdy, which I was concerned about due to the price. The glass part is plastic, which is fine with me because it can't break. The dimensions were accurate. The problem is, it comes with hardware that you have to install yourself. It came it with a wire and nails, which I didn't use. I drilled holes in the back and used screws to install the hooks, and put it on the wall like that. If you want to give this as a gift, you'll probably have to open it and install the hardware before gifting it. I'm glad to have it.For the price of this frame, I was hoping for a more expensive look and a nicer backing (I would have preferred the clips that you can slide on and off rather than the metal clips you push down). The frame looks like it has a bigger border in the pic, but it's true to the .75 inch size as stated. I do like that it's very light weight. I used this to replace a metal frame that had been professionally made for the artwork and this frame was just a smidge too big for the matting but I was able to make it work in the end. Nice that the hardware to hang was all included.I agree with the reviewer who asked: ""Where is the quality for the price?"" I like that these are lightweight. But they do seem pretty flimsy/cheap. Especially for the price. Too tedious to send them back but I would not buy again. They are overpriced. Lastly, for this price I should NOT have to affix the hanging mechanism. So flimsy, I was afraid to split the wood when screwing in the eyes (through which the hanging wire runs). Actually WOOD? Don't know but I guess it is some wood composite/don't think I could have gotten screws into plastic.The acrylic these frames come with is super reflective, it really cheapens what is otherwise a really nice frame, and to order custom acrylic sheets separately raises the whole price of my project considerably; in the end, I would have been better off finding a manufacturer who offered this option. If you are reading this, Craig Frames, please offer a non-glare option!Otherwise these are great, they are sturdy and they were packaged very well.These are really nicely made frames. I particularly like that they are real wood, not MDF or similar. The finish is consistent and the mitered corners join cleanly and the cost was less than I would pay in a local store. Most impressive was the packaging they shipped in. Each frame and glass was separated from the others by a layer of bubble wrap and all three were suspended in the center of a much bigger box.Pro's:","Pro's:

Rated A2 for faster loading and in app performance. Built for and tested in harsh conditions: Temperature Proof, Water Proof, shock Proof and x ray ProofThis review is specifically for the item SanDisk Extreme 128GB microSD UHS-I Card with Adapter - 160MB/s with SanDisk MobileMate USB 3.0 microSD Card Reader. My card was shipped from and sold by Amazon.com. The top review for this card would have you believe the product I received, based on physical appearance, is fake. The speed tests and H2testw program appear to indicate it achieves the advertised speeds and has the correct capacity using the bundled USB 3.0 card reader in a USB 3.0 port on my desktop Windows 10 PC.If this card is somehow ""fake"" it is quite impressive. I'm sure there are some fakes out there, but if you do decide to buy this card it might be worth performing your own tests before deeming it fake based off the looks alone (assuming it's not an incredibly obvious fake).April 18, 2020 (13 month update): card still works great. No complaints, I'm very happy with it.First red flag was when I looked underneath the card. Instead of being solid black like every other SD card I've seen, it looked like a green circuit board with a strange black square on it.Second red flag was the MUCH lower than advertised read/write speeds (only 50-55 write with mid 80s read).Third red flag was when I tried to copy data from my old sd card on to this one. I was able to get about 21.5 GB of data on to it until it unmounted itself from my computer. I then physically removed the card and inserted it back in the computer. Windows recommended that I repair the drive, so I did. After that, I go and try to copy the data again and it unmounted itself, just like before. I tried the same thing by repairing the drive, except this time, Windows informs me that it could not be repaired! Seriously??So much for trying to get a good black Friday deal...Replaced a 64GB memory in my Galaxy S9+, of the same brand just not extreme.Now my phone has more storage space than my two best laptops... of course you know, I will buy more.This, so far, is the holy grail for portable storage... this has more memory than the SSD in my ThinkPad W530 workstation... blows my mind. As far as quality goes, you can't beat SanDisk, they been around since the beginning in the SD card arena.This little tiny thing, is so tiny, I could put it up my rear end, after filling it with days worth of videos and unending images... doubt I will never need this much room but... I like to record a lot. This thing pretty much turned my lowly cell phone into an absolute powerhouse.I love the product been working perfectly since the day I bought it. I bought this specifically for my Nintendo Switch. I previously had the 512GB Micro SD Card but quickly ran that up, so finally this card went on a discount and I was able to buy it!!!Am glad I did I finally have ALL my games on my system, no more having to delete a few here and there to make room for the next game, finally I can just sit back and Buy/Download just about anything I can get, worry free of weather or not I have enough space!!!!After the format I believe I was left with around 953GB and as of now am left with 75.8GB TOTAL left (Including System Memory), which is still very good at least to me since most games are 2 to 8 sometimes 12GB depending on the game.Anyway I have a total of 176 Games the range from huge AAA games to small Nindies (Nintendo Indies) games as well, and again am very happy with my purchase. Also you can see my current inventory of games in the pictures for better idea of what gamesSanDisk advertises this as the fastest read UHS-I in the market (160mb)! Multiple tests on the 128GB don't confirm this claim. I tested the card on my Surface pro (2017), Surface GO and XPS 13 and got only 88mb read speed and 84 write speed at best!! My Samsung Evo select 128GB & 256GB have higher read and write speed.Pro's:","Pro's:

Available in 8 oz gloves, 10 oz gloves, and 12 oz gloves.. THE FUTURE IS FEMALE - Our Female Boxing Gloves are For Women (and Girls) by Women.I really love these. Still have to try them at the dojo, but preliminary tests at home have me loving them.For one: the gloves are sized for a woman�s hands. Other gloves�my hands swim around inside. These: fit me like a ... glove.Two: awesome design(s).Three: the padding is on point, but not to where the glove is heavy or bulky.Overall, I give these 11/10.Perfect size, awesome for cardio/bag workOverall, Cute idea and fun but not the best quality and poor fit. I purchased the 10 ounce gloves (I�m 112lbs) and they were loose on my hands even with the wrap under it. The finger part sits out a bit far and doesn�t allow you to make a fist to punch correctly unless you squeeze down hard. They would be fine for light sparring, but not for hard-hitting or a heavy bag.Didn�t smell on unwrap, break in period takes a bit. I�m about 220, and got the 14oz, wraps keep them on and stable and I have smallish hands. I love these gloves.I agree with other reviewers that if you box a lot these might not be the gloves for you. I�ve only had them three months and already their durability is giving up. For reference I box 5-6 times a week so looking at 60-70 workouts here, when most gloves should last a year. For a while, little shards of the plastic filling would actually come out of the gloves while punching, and now the inside cushions are no longer supportive. Stitching on the thumb is starting to wear too. I feel like my arms and hands are taking the bulk of the impact more now. They�re a cute design but not super functional for the exercise they are intended for.Pro's:","Pro's:

( we will provide the perfect after-sales solution, Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions).So we bought ""warm lights"" from another Amazon seller, and they...were not warm. To say the least. The inside of my RV felt like the inside of an operating room � cold and sterile. So we tried these instead and OH MY GOD SO MUCH BETTER! LOL! Seriously though, if you like yellow / warm lights, these are the ones to buy. We've just thrown away the blue-white ""warm"" ones. Have already bought a second bag just to have as backups.I couldn't be happier with these bulbs as LED retrofit bulbs for RV ceiling lights. My RV has many old incandescent light bulbs in its ceiling lights and sconces and they run hot and I know they use a lot of power. The previous owner was starting to retrofit LED lighting into the rig, but the color temperature of the bulbs they were using, along with the bulbs having a number of dead LED elements and flickering was kind of a turn off, and made me want to try to do my own thing.These are the more appropriate soft white light color, not the bright, cool light temperature, the bulbs do not flicker in operation and do not seem to be affected by extreme temperatures, especially when the rig is cold and you switch on the lights. Light dispersion is excellent, you don't see the individual LED elements through the lens of the ceiling light (opaque lens), the light they emit behaves very similarly to incandescent lights.Bulbs stay cool in their mount. With the old incandescent lights, the light fixture and the lens would get hot to the touch, but with these LED lights, there is only a slight warmth when you touch the lens and no heat in the light fixture itself. Very impressive.So you want to change those inefficient, too-hot-to-touch incandescents..maybe in your camper or rv, but don't like the cool ""blue"" tint? Well so was I! And based on the number of positive reviews, these seemed like the bulbs. Installation was easy, just plug in and turn on! And they are BRIGHT! Easily twice as bright as the ""old"" incandescents. I hear you asking ""But what about the color? That blue tint? What about that?"" These are advertised as ""warm white"" but my experience has shown that may or may not mean anything in regards to color. Anyway, these are definitely ""warmer"" than the ""normal"" LEDs. They aren't as warm as the incandescents they replace, keep in mind. The color resembles that of a brand new halogen (just minus the heat.) As far as longevity, time will have to tell, but I am glad that I found these even if they only last as long as the incandescents.So have had this product for a few months and seems to be working fine . I installed in a old camper to replace the old style bulbs.1- I have less drain on the 12 volt marine battery and it doesn�t add heat to the camper in summer2-originally I wanted a �yellowish � type bulb to have above the bed instead of white but when the covers go on it�s fine -3- good amount of light for hallway4- I wasn�t going high watts when I bough my his volt type due to the draw and not charging battery in camper often5- great replacementThese lights are wonderful! They are a bit brighter than the original bulbs that were in my 1994 trailer. Not sure on the run time, but I know it beats what was in there before!Pro's:","Pro's:

They charge a premium just for that little PlayStation logo in the corner. Stay away from this scam!A month in and it decides that I can't play any of my games. It installed a brand new game on it. I didn't even give it permission to do that. It just did it anyways. Locked me out of the game. Told me to delete it and try again. Then I still couldn't play it. Reinstalled it 4 times. Nope nope nope nope. So solution? Sledgehammer it to death.. WorthlessWell it certainly holds a lot of memory. Like practically the whole playstation store which is great but I have to turn my ps4 on and off and then tell the system to repair the extended storage every single time I use my ps4 which is extremely frustrating and I did nothing to damage the device. It just has sat there next to the ps4 all this time. I�ve only owned this device for a few months.I purchased the 4TB Model in November 2017. It has been less than a year and the drive is already dead(clicking, beeping, etc.). This drive has only ever been connected to a PS4 system. Tried to do a warranty return and Seagate is saying there is no stock in this drive available to replace it. Buy an external Western Digital Drive. Much better quality. A drive should not die in less than a year.Rating improved from 1 star to 3 stars. May improve rating to 5 stars later. Product stopped working after 8 months, but Seagate support has been very responsive and agreed to replace the product. I was happy with the drive when it was working, but will now have to re-download all my games.I believe that customer support is part of the product. If Seagate follows through on their commitments, and my experience indicates that they will, I will raise this rating to 5 stars.

BEST SERVIC:Satisfaction guaranteed . If you have any questions about our products, please contact us, we will contact you within 12 hours.Packs up small - great addition to the camper. Recommend two people when putting up. The last picture is April 2022 and it is still working as advertised.We absolutely love this tent!! We have had a horribly rainy summer here in southeast Alaska and this tent has made it so we can still enjoy camping and out the road adventures even if it's wet and rainy out. It holds up to torrential downpours. Take the time to buy stronger stakes for it though.... ones you can actually drive into hard ground. That is my only complaint.. otherwise this thing is the bomb!!!If you�re looking for backyard shade for limited use and in a wind free environment this will serve the purpose. I would not recommend this for any type of camping environment or any environment where wind will be a factor. The material is thin. Much like a very inexpensive tent would be made of. The bungee cord keeping the fiberglass poles connected together does a sub par job at best. The cord seemed like it has been stretched past its limit and lost its elasticity. The zipper broke after attempting to unzip it the first time. I set it up in my backyard (block walled yard w/no wind) by myself and it was relatively easy. When it was attempted out at the campsite it was a different story. It took 3 people to set it up with 3 -5 knot winds and the onlookers got a exciting comedy act with the occasional verbal outburst and hand gestures aimed at the structure. The concept is a fabulous idea but the material used to construct it made me give it the low rating. One end is open and the other end zippers shut. The side �windows� are closed with small Velcro strips placed along the edges. Snaps or zippers would have been a better method but I understand the need for the break away in case the wind picks up. I thought it would�ve been along the lines of the military type of structure but I was sorely mistaken. Better material, better bungee cord and heavy duty zippers would be worth the extra expense to me. The fiberglass poles seemed to be the only enduring quality.UPDATE:Was delivered 13 April 2020. After the one and only time I used it on a camping trip and the zipper broke I decided to set it up in my backyard. I thought I�d give it a longevity test. In defense of the product, I live in Arizona and the temperatures have been 100+ the past week or so and we�ve had some wind gusts. The attached pictures tell the story of durability with constantly being in the elements. Date of pictures 30 June 2020. I dropped my rating from a 2 to 1 seeing how it only lasted 2 months before it became a disappointing addition to the local landfill.I bought the Hasika Tunnel tent because two friends each have one and I have seen both tents perform in high winds and big rain over the course of a total of 15 days of use. The tent is perfect coverage over a picnic table or to create a shaded/protected seating area. A friend has brought his tent to the beach two years in a row for a 5-7 day camping adventure. The tent is great over two picnic tables placed end to end. There isn't a center support which would preclude other canopies from going over a picnic table. There is tons of wind at the beach and with the right military or sand stakes and the guy lines that come with the ten, the tent just sways in the wind under big gusts. We never put the sides down at the beach so I can't speak to how the tent performs in high wind with the sides down. Alternatively, I have seen the Hasika Tunnel tent perform well in rain. In this case, the tent was placed at the end of the pop up over the rear kitchen on a tear drop camper and all of the sides were down. The tent remained waterproof during the deluge. The only problem (unavoidable) is that water pooled under the tent due to drainage limitations of the site. These tents are not always in stock, so after seeing the tent perform over a two-year timeframe, I bought one when they were recently back in stock. Cannot wait to use it. Ideally this tent needs three people to set it up, but once you have done it once or twice, it gets easier. It is a little like an octopus when it first comes out of the bag. However, the bottom webbing gives the tent a great structure when it is set up. The other added bonus is that this Tunnel is unique and people will stop by your campsite to learn about it. You'll probably make new friends if you buy one!We needed a rain shelter for a multi family camping trip, and this did the job. The fabric is very thin, and the flaps on the side don't seal well, but this did not stop the tent from vastly reducing the wind and virtually eliminating the rain. The kids loved it and dubbed it the 'Kid Cave', set up with music and lights. On sunny days the flaps were rolled up and it was used for shade.It tolerated fairly high winds well. The pegs are (like all tents) useless. I actually used them as twist ties to fasten real pegs to the strings since the pegs I happened to have on hand has string rather than hooks. Plan on buying at least 4 solid hooks for the strings at each end. Those were the only strings I needed to use.Surprisingly versatile for what it is. While I could think of lots of ways to improve this tent, all would drive the cost way up. So use it for what it is, and don't expect more of it than the description says. Don't leave it outside for a whole summer for example.I had several people come up and ask me about it, which never happens with my usual tents, so there must be a niche it is filling.Pro's:","Pro's:

Relax, loose and restore post-workout in these soft BALEAF men's cotton yoga sweatpants, if you need nice roomy athletic pants, you can't go wrong with these.. These sweatpant in cotton blend featuring, skin-friendly and soft fabric offers a smooth, low-friction performance. Loose fit jersey pants with open bottom design are perfect year-round, also the style that occupy the home.. Big side pockets for convenience, keep your phone in them when doing exercise. Relaxed straight leg for great yoga experience.. Drawstring for adjustability, wear the drawcord inside or outside to reduce bulk.. BALEAF men's open bottom pajamas yoga sweatpant provides a comfortable and free sports experience, perfect for yoga, running, hiking, sleep, lounging etcI am a paraplegic and have been looking for the ""perfect"" pants for 10 years now. Since I go through life sitting, most men's pants do not work well at all for me. Dress slacks and khaki's ride up in front and down in back while squeezing the jewels, while sweat pants fit seated lifestyles better but are not really appropriate for going out.My perfect pants wish list was adjustable waist, stretchy, medium-weight but cool, reasonably priced pants that were comfortable but yet looked nice enough to lounge around at home or go out for a ""night on the town"". It is a LONG list which I why I have spent 10 years looking and failing, but I believe these pants may have just scored 10 in every category!First I will say that the quality of these pants is as good or better than similar pants I have purchased costing over twice this price. Seams, stitching, and sizing all appear to be perfect so far! I will have to see how they hold up through some wear and wash cycles but nothing I have noticed so far makes me believe there will be any problems. The fabric is just awesome! It is a medium-weight fabric that is cool to the touch, extremely soft, and has 4-way stretch, though to look at it you would never know. I could easily pair these pants with a nice polo and they would pass for dress slacks or with a tee and pass them off as dockers, assuming I am not tucking in my shirt! Yet, unlike slacks or khakis, I have full range-of-motion if I am transferring in/out of my chair or pulling them on and off thanks to the generous stretch they provide.They do not have back pockets, which I LOVE because I cannot use them and they just tend to bunch up under me, but the two front pockets have plenty of room for a phone or wallet and the stretchy material should easily help prevent them from falling out while moving about or working out. The waist band is well made and as soft on the inside as it is on the outside, and looks like it should hold up well for a long time. I bought these in a medium based on their sizing chart and this size is perfect for me. I am 5' 10"" and around 165 lbs and usually wear a size 34/30 to 34/32 pant, and these are perfect in the waist and length.I have not laundered them yet but I will follow the cold wash and tumble air-dry without fabric softener that the tag recommends and see how that works out. I will update this review should I run into any issues after I've worn and washed them for a while, but I don't currently expect to have any. All in all, if you are looking for a pair of crazy soft, comfortable, well-made, nice-looking and affordably priced pants to wear for lounging, working out, or even wearing out and about, give these a try! I only wish they made them in a few more colors like charcoal or light grey!As with every other sweats I have tried from Amazon, these sweats were way too short in the leg. I am 6 foot, 180 lbs, and over all pretty normal for a guy. I ordered a large and what I received was too short in the leg (high waters) and the crotch was already a bit baggy. On with the search. I am starting to believe I will never find sweats that fit.nice fit and feel for the price . I have payed a lot more for lesser quality . I�m 5�9 ,180 lbs and I got a large .I got these for Christmas and he�s been wearing them for yoga, other exercise, and lounging. He loves them so much he asked me to order more. His quads have been getting large from his work out/weightlifting regimen and he finds these comfortable for his thicc legs lol. He�s worn the ones from Christmas a lot and we�ve washed them multiple times a week and they still look great.Was searching for some kind of alternative to sweat pants for working at home and I stumbled upon these magical yoga pants. I gave them a try and ordered a XXL (I am 6""4"" 230lbs) and they fit perfectly. Just loose enough but they don't look baggy. I probably could have gotten by with an XL if I wanted a tighter more fitted look but the XXL is absolutely perfect for what I wanted. The moment I put them on I knew I had found something special. Light, comfortable, stretchy, but still warm enough to wear outside if needed....these could quite possibly be the holy grail of comfortable pants for men. The waist elastic is perfect and sits just right (not too high, not too low) and the length is spot on. I ordered a second pair in another color immediately and they have become my go to pants for daily wear. I don't think a single day has gone by that I haven't worn a pair of these over the last 5 weeks and I couldn't be happier. They have held up to multiple washes (I use the delicate cycle and cold) and I have dried them on Ultra Low temp in the dryer without any problem at all even though the tag says hang dry.A great alternative to sweat pants, these are more comfortable, better looking, and have nice deep pockets to hold your phone, wallet, etc. I will definitely be buying more of these pants soon and when I venture back out to the gym again someday I imagine these will be excellent to work out in as well. This is my first experience with the Baleaf brand but I have already ordered more of their products and if they are anything close to as comfortable as these pants are I will be a customer for life. Great product....seriously, how did I not know about these things for so long. Goodbye old sweatpants.Pro's:","Pro's:

I contacted Amazon and they replaced it right away.

It�s easy to operate and the initial setup was also very simple. It�s different than the other type of cooler and is a true air conditioner in a hot summer days. It can reduces the temp in the room within a minute or less. It comes with wheels so moving it from one room to another is also a breeze. I thought it might be loud with this type of units but turns out I was wrong. It was relatively quiet when turned on.It works wonderfully.

We have a 1200 square foot home and only the 2 bedrooms don't get cooled off.This AC unit is easy to use and quick to install. Cools the room pretty fast. My only complaint is it�s a little bit louder than I had hoped but works great enough to cancel out the sound. When you need AC you need it now. I�m totally satisfied with my purchase and ended up getting two units.Pro's:","Pro's:

In addition, It included a Remote Control to provide you the convenience to control the Air Conditioner, you can easily set the time, temperature, mode, speed, and swing alsonanSo far it works well. I see someone has said it is noisy. It is no more noisy than other window air conditioners I have used. Beautifully packaged so no damage could occur during shipping. Simple set-up. I don�t use the remote control so I cannot comment on it. It�s not really needed. I don�t channel surf the air conditioner. NOTE on shipping. They say in the ad that it will reach you 2 to 3 days after shipped. The wording is carefully chosen on purpose. It took two weeks from when I ordered it. It took quite a bit of research to find out that the unit is made in China from a Chinese company and that may explain the late shipping or it was pretty classic for Amazon to hang on to packages for awhile before getting them shipped. Most internet sites that discuss the company leave out ANY discussion of where the company resides. I finally found a discussion on two sites that rank overall success of corporations. That was when I found out it was from China and of course when it came, it says made in China.On the plus side the remote control was functional and the air conditioner seemed to reduce the temperature in our master bedroom after about 5m.The machine is LOUD. It�s �Quiet operation� and �Low noise mode� were enough to begin to give my wife a headache inside of 20 minutes. I used both my Apple Watch and an app on my iPhone to measure my the decibels. With it as quiet as it could be and still be on (low fan, no rotating fan) I still measured 69 dB from about 3 feet away. My wife had it on for 20 minutes, and was across the room about 15 feet away, and still began getting a headache. She put on her noise canceling headphones but the sound still cut through.Would not recommend.We purchased this AC unit for our thirty two foot sailboat. It gets hot in the cabin on warm summer days, particularly when there is little or no wind. Sleeping at night, even with fans going, can be difficult because of the warm air at night. I expected the unit would just barely keep things cool, but the unit came through with flying colors. It was also very humid outside, and we noticed after about two hours that a big bowl capturing water from the drainage hose was almost full! We will be using the unit quite often this summer and are very pleased with its performance.Cools our living quickly, fairly light compared to our other one so it�s easy to move between rooms. Makes some noise, but it�s a soft white noise, not bad for sleeping. We let it sit in the box up right for about 48 hours after delivery and it works great. Setup was easy, took less than 10 mins.Pro's:","Pro's:

Yes, it has plexiglass not real glass. But, this is just perfect if you intend to ship your diamond painting to someone. The glass will not be broken. I've done 3 diamond paintings and purchased 3 of these frames. Shipping is quick and no issues with damage. I'll buy more as I do more of these off-sized diamond paintings. It's perfect for what it is.I can�t believe I paid $32.99 for this. This was not made for a 16 x 24 poster. It was just a little bit smaller and damaged my poster trying to put it in the frame. This was also damaged when I opened it. Made very cheap. Don�t know when I have been ripped off this bad. Do not recommend this for the price. It is worth about $8.00.i ordered 3 of these in different colors, and they all arrived flawless. (there was a smudge on one mat, but i just buffed it out with a pencil eraser.) easy to put together with a little patience, clever hanging mechanism (tip: the plastic piece gets nailed to the wall, the metal piece slides over the edge of the backing before you secure it in place), and best of all, they look great.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: White 16x20 wall frame with double white mat opening for a 11x14 image. Airfloat mat adds dimension and depth to your art by creating a shadow effect with a separated double mat feature. Includes ready-to-hang hangers on the back for vertical or horizontal hanging options making it easy for you to showcase your photos or art, beautifully. Frame is crafted from durable solid wood with easy-open tabs on the back let you load your photos quickly. Lightweight protective glass will keep your favorite photos looking great for yearsThese are my go-to frames for all of my photography. They are well made and easy to use. I take the glass out and clean both sides. Dust the frame a bit and reinsert the glass. I hinge my photos onto the mats with linen tape. Buyers seem to like the floating double mats. The backing board and hangers are not cheap cardboard but a nice finished black which looks more professional. I place the included paper behind the matted photo for an extra layer. I have ordered over 100 of these frames in different sizes. Each frames comes in an individual bow with three layers of bubble-wrap for protection. I have never had one be defective so far.These are very nice frames - the type with the turn hinge for taking photos in and out - not those thin little metals pieces that flip up and break. There are 2 mats which are thin, not like the thick good kind. The mats go to the gray in the space I have the prints framed. There is a gray wall on the side but it's the mat as they looked to the gray white on the counters when I was putting the prints in them. I like them alot for the price.This frame came VERY carefully boxed and was undamaged. The frame quality is excellent and the overall finish of the frame is outstanding. It comes with robust attachments for adding hanging wire. It's extremely easy to open, place you art inside, and close. It's glass and not plexiglass, but I'm not sure if the glass is UV resistant to preserve the art underneath. The matting looks great as well. Overall - a terriific deal. The only question is why can't we produce a frame like this here vs. having to bring them in from China.I loved the double matting on these frames, the hanging hardware and overall look was of a much more expensive frame. I had been looking for an alternative frame for my large art prints as the ones I had been getting were often damaged slightly on the corners. These are fantastic, the only gripe I have is that the mat is a light grey color, and would have preferred a white or cream to match the paper color I use, Would be great to have mat color options in the future! overall a fab product.I needed a 16 x 20 picture frame to replace one that broke. This frame was exactly what I needed to reframe my print and finish a guest bedroom.When the frame arrived and was finally unpacked (so very carefully packed) it already had a beautiful floral picture which actually looked better than the one I had.SO now the frame and print, are in my guest bedroom and looks better than what I originally had!!!! LOL.It's very well made, has attached hangers for a vertical or horizontal position, thick glass, and beautiful mat. Well worth the money.Pro's:","Pro's:

Available in 8 oz gloves, 10 oz gloves, and 12 oz gloves.. THE FUTURE IS FEMALE - Our Female Boxing Gloves are For Women (and Girls) by Women.I really love these. Still have to try them at the dojo, but preliminary tests at home have me loving them.For one: the gloves are sized for a woman�s hands. Other gloves�my hands swim around inside. These: fit me like a ... glove.Two: awesome design(s).Three: the padding is on point, but not to where the glove is heavy or bulky.Overall, I give these 11/10.Perfect size, awesome for cardio/bag workOverall, Cute idea and fun but not the best quality and poor fit. I purchased the 10 ounce gloves (I�m 112lbs) and they were loose on my hands even with the wrap under it. The finger part sits out a bit far and doesn�t allow you to make a fist to punch correctly unless you squeeze down hard. They would be fine for light sparring, but not for hard-hitting or a heavy bag.Didn�t smell on unwrap, break in period takes a bit. I�m about 220, and got the 14oz, wraps keep them on and stable and I have smallish hands. I love these gloves.I agree with other reviewers that if you box a lot these might not be the gloves for you. I�ve only had them three months and already their durability is giving up. For reference I box 5-6 times a week so looking at 60-70 workouts here, when most gloves should last a year. For a while, little shards of the plastic filling would actually come out of the gloves while punching, and now the inside cushions are no longer supportive. Stitching on the thumb is starting to wear too. I feel like my arms and hands are taking the bulk of the impact more now. They�re a cute design but not super functional for the exercise they are intended for.Pro's:","Pro's:

It was a two man job but was assembled in less than 2 hours. Very sturdy and fits perfectly on our patio. Love the netting on all sides for easy access. It looks better than the pictures. Very happy so far with this purchaseI�m love with this gazebo, easy to ensamble, me and my husband did everything in two hours, excellent quality, everything was complete and fit perfect, my family loved to spend the afternoons sitting there with this warm weather in Florida, best purchase ever!!!I give ABC canopy five stars for both customer service and product quality. I had a mishap were accidentally ordered a different tent from Home Depot before ordering this tent on Amazon. When the tent from Home Depot arrived I thought it was this tent and complained to ABC canopy that they sent me the wrong product. After going back-and-forth many times, I finally realized the mistake that I had made. ABC�s customer service department was extremely professional and nice to me even when I was being impatient and rude. I apologized vehemently but still feel bad for the mishap. In terms of the tent, the quality could not be better. It is much higher quality than any other tents I�ve seen at the farmers market. The frame is very sturdy but also easy to set up and take down. The accessories are fantastic because they allow for lots of different weather conditions. The fabric is very high-quality and blocks the sun quite well. I am extremely happy with my purchase!After lots of research and reading of reviews, I decided to give this one a try. I live in Hawaii so it gets hot, rainy, windy�everything. I have a small 8x8 wooden patio and this gazebo is perfect for it. Assembly took maybe an hour with two people. It would probably be doable with one person but I wouldn�t recommend that. The individual welds in the pieces are very poorly done so be careful when putting it together so you don�t bend one of the pieces. Once put together it sort of stabilizes itself. So far it seems sturdy and looks very nice. I screwed it directly into my wooden deck. Overall, I am super happy with it. Delivery was very fast and I now get a lot more use out if my outdoor space??I was worried having seen and used many pop up canopies in the past. I read the reviews and thought, I�ll see. My wife needing a new one for a swap meet bought another brand and I bought this one. Hers has never made it up in the air without issue, save $20 and it will cost you, buy the real deal and don�t worry about being pinched, leaning, collapsing, junk. The ABC is awesome, bag is awesome, wheels on the bag.....awesome! Easy up with one but it�s easier with two, shade curtains, awesome, I couldn�t be happier with the purchase and when the time comes that I need another, I know what I am going to buy and it will say ABC on it! I use it at the house, at car shows, sporting events, parking lots, grass, asphalt, concrete. Don�t wait, don�t hesitate, make sure you have room to haul it, and then buy it and enjoy it worry free!Pro's:","Pro's:

It has been an amazingly reliable and effective air conditioner. Cools perfectly in warm weather and works well in the winter to generate needed heat. We are more than pleased. --------Earlier comments: We have it installed in a wall about a foot off of the floor. I really haven't had a chance to use the air conditioning part, but the heat mechanism works as advertised. I'm in Dallas and we really haven't had weather below 40 where I have used it. But, in the low 40's it works well. I generally have it set between 68 and 72. I turn mine off at 10 pm because the room where I have it installed it isn't used after that hour. It cycles on when needed and off as the room heats up, performing as you would expect.Poor quality construction. Fan is very loud. The heat is resistance heat which is very expensive to operate. No heat pump and the heating mode.Quieter than I thought it would be, even at high speed, which is very nice. Cools the large area I have it in very quickly, which has older windows totally covering three sides of the room, and maintains the temperature well. Don't know how the heat works yet, but it does blow warm pretty quickly when turned to heat. Very happy with the purchase and quick shipping.Was very easy to set up, the side fan blower is awesome, cool air shots across the room very fast!!

Text: Comes with regular glass and a saw tooth hanger for wall mounting. Made of wood - this one of a kind custom picture frame will enhance any piece of art you put in it. For other colors and non-standard sizes in this frame style search '2WOMD10188-4x4'. Fits 14x18 inch photos! actual frame Size (finished Size) is 16x20 inches and the frame is 1.25 inches wide.. This frame is not you generic picture frame but a custom design that you won't find anywhere elseVery disappointed. The frame is plastic, painted to look like wood. The edges aren't flush and one corner is chipped. The ""plexi glass"" is a super thin acrylic sheet that came with a scuff mark.... this looks like a cheap Dollar Store frame. Not worth the money and not what I want hung up in my business office.I ordered two of these frames and I have to say, I was not expecting much at all. I was expecting cheap, as I was paying cheap. However, these are clearly not real wood. These appear to be particle board or MDF made to look like wood. Now, the reason I know this is because both of these came in broken in multiple spots and the plexiglass as well.The packaging was horrible. It was wrapped in plastic wrap and stuck into cardboard instead of any padding or bubble wrap. Mind you these WERE bought buy the actual company Art To Frames, AND they were even stamped on the box it came in.Yes, this is in part the UPS's fault, however with proper packaging these would have been fine. I HIGHLY recommend staying away from this, as it's going to be VERY hit or miss, and please DO NOT put anything of real value in here. The backing was cardboard that was uneven and would cause damage and bends in your print (mine are hand pulled cotton prints from an artist) and the plexi is VERY thin and bends easily.The frame itself is also very fragile, and bends EXTREMELY easily. This is again due to the very cheap materials they used to make these.Now, I wouldn't have been as surprised but on their website these are nearly $100 frames.If this was $20 a frame, I wouldn't be surprised, but these are $50 and $65 frames here on amazon.AS FOR LOOKS: This is another key factor. The frames I ordered don't look like what I ordered hardly at all. The dimensions given in their description of how wide and deep the frame itself is are both wrong.PLEASE BE CAREFUL if you are looking for a cheap solution to an expensive/ semi expensive print or poster. I would recommend only putting things costing around $10 in this or things that you can have remade. My prints are not very expensive but are limited (both out of 25) from an artist and would be unable to be replaced.Here are the problems with this frame:- The plexiglass is too small for the opening of the frame and POPS OUT! (see photos)- I ordered a 16""x24"" frame and what I got is 16 1/4""x24 1/8""- The backing is straight up corrugated cardboard- It looks like a cheap, tacky frame- The plexiglass is difficult to clean because dust and fuzz cling to it- The plexiglass scratches easily! I wiped it down with a soft, clean, damp cotton cloth and it still scratched the surfaceThe positives:- It seems relatively sturdy and if you handle it gently it should stay that way...maybe.- It was packaged wellOverall, this frame is cheap in every sense of the word and is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.You can check my review history. It's rare for me to write a negative review. But this frame's plastic front detracts from the picture it's displaying and that's the primary purpose of the frame.The plastic front (what used to be glass) is a thin flexible sheet of clear plastic. In the instructions, they tell you that ""one or both"" sides of it is covered in a plastic layer that needs to be peeled off. Well my husband and I both tried and tried, with our fingers, with our nails, with strong tape, with pins, with tweezers, and we could not get any plastic layer off. Either it's not on there - in which case, they need to send accurate instructions - or it's darned near impossible to remove.The plastic sheet also had a couple of markings (light scratches) on it that I couldn't get out. And they're positioned so that one or the other of them is going to end up right over my son's head.On the plus side, the frame itself is as gorgeous as I'd hoped (thus the two stars) and it came well packaged. Don't buy this if you're in a hurry though because it takes some time to arrive.I was disappointed that I had to measure, place, and hammer in the sawtooth hanger myself. Needless to say, Martha Stewart would not be impressed. The packaging said I could choose between sawtooth and the included wire hanger assembly. But there was no wire hanger assembly included. A shame because with my skills, that would have resulted in a more perfect hang.If you can find another frame you like, buy it. This one's a pain in the a** and the ""glass"" front may have noticeable scratches. But if you can't, this'll do. Just set aside some time and patience. And if you don't find any plastic sheet to remove from the glass panel, don't sweat it. It's probably not there.This review is for Art to Frame product WOMD5026-14x18. The frame is wood with glass. Very sturdy and well made. From the product photo, I had imagined gold beaded trim surrounding a light brown core. It is actually all gold...""muted"" perhaps, but definitely gold. It works, but it is different than I had imagined. As others have mentioned, the sawtooth hanger is not attached. I assume this is either simplifies shipping or is for customer flexibility. It would not be fun to mount this hanger on the frame using a hammer or pliers. I drilled 1/16"" holes and pressed it in to place. A bit of a bother. If the manufacture doesn't, for some reason, want to install the hanger, they could at least pre-drill the mounting holes for either vertical or horizontal use....Pro's:","Pro's:

A mesh palm to keep the hands cool and comfortable as you train to reach your fitness goals. These sparring punching bag mitts come in a variety of colors and are sure to give you a competitive high calorie burning workoutI've used a whole bunch of different training gloves. These are my favorites. Incredibly durable. About a year and a half of hard use from a big guy: I hit hard; I sweat a lot; I don't take particularly good care of my equipment. The only things I've noticed are a small hole in the internal fabric by my right middle finger tip and some obvious wear on the cosmetic design.No, these aren't fight gloves. They're for training. Heavy bag, light sparring - they're perfect. I've seen some comments that these may not be a full 16 oz. I'm not sure about that. If so, I feel bad for sparring with these. Otherwise, they are awesome gloves. The foam padding over the fist is more than adequate to absorb a great deal of impact but still communicate the feel of a punch snapping vs pushing, landing vs glancing, etc. They're not so big that you can cover your whole face with one like some other of those big pillowy gloves. The wrist support is pretty solid when snugged down tight. EASY on and off, unlike all of these wacky X-closures and overlapping straps that you need an engineering degree to take off.Great, great gloves. I'll buy another pair if these ever give out (maybe not in ostentatious gold, though)They feel great, they look amazing, the value is excellent.Amazing buy, exactly like the photos.

Except, the acrylic face is obvious and a little distracting. That part looks cheap. The rest of the frame looks fine.UPDATE: I failed to remove the protector sheet on the other side of the acrylic screen. Once removed, it is visually not distinguishable to me from glass.I needed some inexpensive frames for some of my son's artwork and came across these on Amazon. Although they are not solid wood they look very nice and the size was exact. They are very light weight so I'll be able to use 3M hangers and not damage my wall, even though they do come with picture hanging hardware. I am very happy with my purchase for the quality and price, so I'll be ordering a few more.We ordered this frame for a numbered piece of art we purchased at a gallery along with another size for another numbered piece of art. We didn�t want a huge frame with a mat surround. I wanted a classic black frame that would fit around this art without spending a fortune as it is difficult to hang the art in a multi stairwell. This was the only frame I could find that had the correct size and weight I needed. The price is marked up and the quality doesn�t match the price, however it works for what I wanted.The frame itself came in quality packaging and was super easy to place art into and the plastic coating on the plexiglass was well thought out. I simply unpacked the frame, layer it out on our dining table onto a beach towel. I picked up the plexiglass and removed the visual side of the plastic coating and placed it into its frame again without putting finger prints on it. Then I gently picked the corner leaving it in the frame and pulled it back with my other hand on the bottom part of the plastic coating and never made contact with my fingers to keep it clean. I place my artwork face down and made sure the hook on the back and the artwork was in the correct position. I put the cardboard backing on and closed all the little pegs. Hung and I love it!The frame quality is fine and the price was reasonable, but it's not 16x28. When I tried to put my poster that *is* 16x28 (measured at least twice to be sure before purchasing) in it, it was too large. I measured the cardboard backing and it's off by half an inch in both length and width, which meant I had to trim the edges of the poster.I am keeping the frame because my clumsy trimming is not noticeable at all once in the frame and it does look nice on the wall, but I am disappointed by the inaccurate dimensions, especially when this is not a standard size.Before I ordered my frame, I read the reviews to see what people were saying about this frame. some were good and some were not. But I wanted that frame but I didn't want the problems that the the reviews that were not good to happen to me. In good faith, I ordered the frame and they contacted to me about security for my package for the delivery. I was actually impressed. I told them among other things, that I needed them to secure the delivery by way of making sure they packaged this frame so that it would not be damaged. They responded ""sure we will."" I wasn't feeling that answer but I decided to let it go and trust that their word would be true. A week later I received my frame and I was ecstatic to see that it was in pristine condition.As careful as I was I scratched it thankfully the picture in it hides it so. over all I am thrilled because it looks beautiful. Nicely done. thank you!Pro's:","Pro's:

Equipped with an removable shoulder strap and the soft carry handle, you can switch to the more comfortable way freely. It can be used as a office computer bag, business laptop briefcase, travel laptop bag, professional mens briefcase, etcA surprisingly wonderful upgrade from my old favorite bag. I had a similar bag made of faux leather (fake leather, ""pleather"") that was peeling and falling apart all over. It was the most practical work bag I ever had, but it was time for me to retire it. I kept using it while searched for a new bag for about a year, and finally found this one. I was hesitant since my last bag was such a great fit, but the price of this one was worth the risk. The sturdy fabric of this bag was a definite selling point because the peeling pleather of my old bag is what really did it in. This bag has enough compartments to suit my needs (somewhat of a portable office) and looks profession and not bulky even when full. I do wish it had a small, deep pocket for a water bottle, but it will do. My primary need is for a professional looking bag that can hold all of my work and supplies, and this is it.UPDATE: I've been using this every day for work for the past four months, and it's still holding up. Fabric still looks good as new and no signs of stress on the seams despite stuffing it with about 15 pounds of paperwork, supplies, and my laptop every day.This laptop/document bag is for the professional. I was amazed with how much room this product has. Per the ad it expands and provides more than ample space for any professional. I place my laptop in a protected compartment and the various literature and forms necessary to conduct business.For the price, you cannot go wrong with this briefcase.This bag looks like a million bucks! I'm kind of amazed at how many pockets and divided areas there are...its so roomy, but it's very sleek. I'm hugely impressed with this bagI just received the bag a couple of days ago. However, I have looked it over and I like the fact that there are many compartments in it. I can throw all of my items from my pocketbook into this laptop bag and include my 15.6"" laptop, mouse, chargers, and any other computer necessities. I love the strap on the back of the bag, which will allow me to attach it to my luggage. It appears to be of good quality.My only complaint is that the shoulder strap could be longer. It will do for me, but I was hoping that it would have extended farther.I recommend this bag to anyone who is interested in quality and space.This is going to be perfect for travel purposes. The design has been well thought out, so space has been allocated for everything. The fabric used as the dividers between compartments feels a bit thin. As the product on the whole looks to be made from durable material, I am sure the dividers will stand up to the use for which it is intended. I will be using my shock proof laptop insert from my old bag for extra protection. A padded laptop insert is the only thing that could be added to make this a totally perfect item.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Hardwood and engineered wood offers incredible structural strength and durability.. Aged maple for a classic warm finish.. Veneer provides the beauty and feel of natural woodgrain. Keep space looking tidy by closing drop-down keyboard tray when not in use.. Drawers provide convenient and easy-to-access storage.. Timeless antique bronze finish on hardware adds a touch of warmth and beauty to your home.. Some assembly required using our easy-to-understand directions.. Furniture conveniently delivers straight to your home.GO FOR IT. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. It is actual wood. I mean, unless I don't know the definition of wood-it's actual wood. Not a veneer. It's also very pretty. It does not appear orangey or give off too much of a country vibe (unless you want/need it too). I was able to put it together in under two hours. It was not frustrating. I am an undersized woman with a shoulder impingement. The hardest part was finding a screwdriver. The materials provided are clearly high quality. I am no expert but have assembled many pieces of furniture and know how crappy parts can be. I also have some relatively expensive furniture and this has some components which are pretty impressive for this price range. Really impressive actually. I expect this little beauty to last a long time and I cannot say that about a lot of furniture in this price range. In other words - DON'T HESITATE. If you want WOOD and you find the looks of this little desk pleasing buy it. I'd probably even put it together for you for 50 bucks. It's not too hard. Standing it up (even without drawers) was pretty hard for me though. Fast shipping too. Great experience. Thanks to the manufacturer and seller! NiceThis desk looks great and has good quality wood, no particle board or MDF. Assembly of parts still uses cam bolts which I don't particularly like. Drawers need to be assembled but very easy. Not top furniture quality with dovetails or high strength joints between wood pieces, but pretty solid when assembled and definitely a good value for the money. Ball bearing slides on keyboard drawer. Plastic rollers on side drawers. Also, even though 2 knobs on each side, there is only one drawer on each side. The only negative is Styrofoam packaging gets everywhere, so a bit of vacuuming and cleaning prior to assembly (make sure you clean drawer slides!). Still really like the mission look of this desk.First of all, the box is very very heavy so you�ll need another person to help you pick it up to move inside. Assembly took about an hour and a half but it was pretty easy and straightforward as long as you follow the directions. Be careful with the cam locks when screwing them in place because they can easily bend an break in half if not inserted in the just the right position. The side drawers are very long and deep, I like that they were 2 big drawers as opposed to 4 small ones, you can stuff more into them. The table itself if really heavy and feels super sturdy and overall just great quality. Wayfair has this same table for $430 so you�re saving a little over $100, plus, if you have prime, fast shipping. Overall, the table is big, awesome, and worth the money.I looked at this item for months on WAYFAIR.COM but just couldn�t pull the trigger because of the cost. All of a sudden, it shows up on AMAZON.COM. $200+ less and I did side by side comparisons. It the same desk. AMAZON delivered in two days. Dropped it on my front porch and it was game on. This item came packaged perfectly. Little scrapes on the box but that happens sometimes with an item that weighs this much. Very easy to assemble, as long as you follow the fairly simple directions. Liked it so much, we bought another one and now I have to give my office a complete makeover. These are just too nice. I can�t believe some folks are giving less than 5 stars. This is a great product and you can�t beat AMAZON�s delivery. If you want a nice desk that you�ll have for a long time, buy this one�or get two!After weeks of searching, I finally found a great solid wood desk at a good price. No manufactured wood! Very easy to assemble and not time consuming. Fits perfectly into the space and will serve well as my main desk. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a QUALITY built writing desk. Home Styles has not disappointed on the craftsmanship and design of this desk.Pro's:","Pro's:

Let's start with the outer side pockets (2), they are pleated, so they can expand to a pretty large size (remember those old Gatorade bottles that were super wide, yeah it can do that).

Promptly Packaged with Free Gift BoxI would give this chain a zero if I had a chance. SO disappointed in the size of this chain, it is definitely NOT a 1mm chain. It�s a good thing it�s shiny or you couldn�t even see it on your neck. I bought this based on some good reviews BUT obviously they did not get the same chain I did. This is about a $20 value at most. I will think twice before I purchase anything from this company.I was hesitant but free return option was available so I got it.

BANNED SUBSTANCE TESTED � highest quality control measures so you feel comfortable and safe consuming the product. 8 SIZES TO CHOOSE FROM � 1, 2, 5, and 10-pound options availableI am strong now. This whey protein gives me the strength to move mountains. Build walls. Break them back down. Build another wall. Call my mom and tell her I love her. Have profound conversations with myself about the falsehoods that is ego and realize that hyper masculinity is an illusion to mask years of fearing things I don�t understand and limited thinking. Thanks whey for giving me the brute strength to overcome my fears of becoming a ballerina.Best protein on the market. For everyone saying the formula has changed... as far as the Double Rich Chocolate I've been getting for YEARS, there is no change as of a week ago (Jan-2018). No Sucralose. Just avoid flavors like Cake Batter, Ice Cream and Banana.I�m not a body builder by any means. I work out about three times a week and I use the protein powder for a post work out shake or for a quick breakfast. I�m not on strict diets or anything like that, so my review is from a regular joe who works our mostly to stay in decent shape and stay alive. The protein powder as a shake is pretty delicious. No weird aftertaste like many other powders, and it�s really filling. I�m sure most �pros� know all the tips but for those of you that don�t, it helps if you mix the powder with whatever liquid you prefer, I use soy milk, before adding ice. If you put everything in at the same time the powder gets clumpy. I don�t know why, but that�s been my experience. I use a blender not a shaker. Again, the chocolate malt is what I like and it tastes great.Pros:- Mixes really well and quickly with anything including a stick.- Tastes like a milk shake even if you just mix it with cold water.- Has very little sugar (1g per serving)- Comes with a scooper.Cons:- The only con I found is that it does not taste as good at room temperature. So since my gym is like 3 blocks away from my home, I 'wheyt' till I get home to drink it heh.My message is the same as quite a few others but I wanted to share my experience in hopes that more people become aware.I have been using Optimum Nutrition protein for 10 years now. In my eyes it has always been the industry standard. Good ingredients, great taste, no BS.I received my last 5lb tub of Vanilla creme yesterday and made a shake. It was absolutely disgusting. The shake was so sweet I gagged but reluctantly finished it. This was at night. The morning after I had diarrhea. Browsing through the comments it seems other people are having the same experience too.Surely this is due to the recent change to the formula where they added sucralose, an artifical sweetener.I'm now stuck with 5lb of inedible powder and left with the task of finding a new company to purchase my protein powder from.Well done, ON.Oh, and thanks for the diarrhea.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Combines 25g Protein and 10g Collagen --- By combining lactose-free milk protein isolate with collagen peptides, Vital Performance Protein Powder delivers 25g of complete protein designed to complement your fitness routine.. Why We Can Say 'Lactose-Free' --- The process of milk ? milk protein concentrate ? milk protein isolate ? lactase enzyme helps to further reduce the lactose content. Excellent supplement for lactose-intolerant and active lifestyle consumers, looking to boost their daily intake of complete, high-quality protein and collagen.. What It Does ---- Dairy proteins are high-quality proteins, due to their EAA content and digestibility. Our milk protein isolate delivers the same casein to whey ratio (80:20) as milk. It provides a robust amino acid profile to support muscle protein synthesis and improved recovery.**. Versatile Collagen ---- 10g of Collagen, sourced from grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine hide. Digested and absorbed by the body quickly for maximum benefits. Helps promote healthy bones, joints and tendons.**. Anytime Protein ---- When you want to boost your protein and collagen intake throughout the day, this protein powder is ideal for both post-workout recovery and anytime nutrition**. Blend 2 scoops into cold water or into your favorite smoothie recipe. If you want to boost the leucine content > 2.5, consider 3 scoops per day.So many protein powder companies sell half empty containers and claim that the product settles. That may be true but it's also possible to pack it in better. This product demonstrates that those other companies are either not investing in the equipment needed to better pack in powder or engaging in deceptive marketing using larger containers. Bravo and 5 stars for this alone. Also, it tastes good. Could use less sugar though.Great taste, great thickness. I mixed it with milk and frozen fruit to thicken. The only problem is that it gave me an upset stomach. I think it is due to the inclusion of MTC. I have had trouble with products including MTC oil before. I hoped that it being such a small amount, it wouldn't bother me, but unfortunately it did. If you have no trouble with MTC oil, I would highly recommend this product.I am not paid to review this product first and foremost.This is delicious, smoothe and a high quality product overall. It is best to shake or blend it. I stirred it first and it was 90% mixed well with my almond milk. However even the smallest little ""ball"" of powder stuck to my glass drives me crazy. I am lactose intolerant, so regular whey protein sends me to the bathroom almost instantly. This didn't do that to me, even a few hours after ingesting it.. I will be purchasing this again. The chocolate flavor is what I purchased. The jury is still out on the flavor profile of the others, but I will be trying them soon.Bottom line, but itttt!I've used different protein powders off and on for years. This is by far the best tasting one I've ever used. I like the energy boost it gives as well. Usually mix mine w oatmilk and different fruit blends and it makes it a super filling meal replacement for me.I got this on a flash sale thinking it would be another protein I choke down...however it turned out to be one of my favorites now! I was looking for something I could use to make protein coffee or hot cocoa in the mornings. A full serving is 2 scoops, but I add one scoop and I seriously notice no difference in texture of my drink, it just makes it a little chocolatey. I also have IBS so finding protein powders that don't upset my stomach is rare. This one hasn't bothered me though. I did take away a star for the monk fruit sweetener as an ingredient but I haven't noticed any weird after tasted that monk fruit can be known for sometimes.Pro's:","Pro's:

Four twin spinner wheels assuring multi-directional rolling and optional stability with zero weight on your handWe have had this suitcase for about 3 months, my partner and I travel a lot for work and pleasure so I did some extensive research on the pros and cons of hard luggage vs soft and the different types of wheels etc. This Aero Delsey line was always one of the top rated and made just about every travel blog luggage rating list I saw. We bought a whole set, the 29"", 25"" and 2 of the smallest ones the 19"" that has the outside pocket and can fit in a overhead bin. I would recommend getting the 3rd party warranty as it covers about anything and is well worth it if you do travel a lot like we do. All of the sizes that we purchased fit inside one another which is great for storage. You do have to get use to how to pack and open the hard luggage if you have never used them before. Don't want all of you stuff pouring out in be hotel. Couple of things I would say to think about if you are looking for new luggage. The wheels are so important, these spinners are great make sure that no matter which luggage you end up buying make sure the wheels are double-sided spinners so it's little 2 little wheels on each one (like on office chairs) some of the cheaper, and even more expensive brands have single wheels and they will wear down faster and break more easily. Also one thing to note, when you have these hard shell suitcases and you get to a hotel or where ever you are traveling to, if you are the type of person that likes to setup a luggage stand and just live out of your suitcase sitting on it, these may not be the best option for you. Since items are stored evenly on each side you have to open the suit case fully like a book to really access everything and to pack and unpack it, just something to consider. In the 3 months we have had these we have traveled 2 times internationally and probably 4-5 times domestically like NYC area to FL and NC, checking these hard shell suitcases does get some scratches on them but overall they have really held up well. The side handles, retractable handle and the wheels have all remained sturdy and we have not had any issues. The lock works great on the side and the inside zipper compartment and straps all work great. You can really fit a lot into these suitcases and the best part about this model is that is gives a little unlike some hard shells so you can fit that extra few things in, it also has the zipper expander but we have not needed to expand it any. The luggage looks great and very stylish, have taken it right into meetings with me and even had some complements. Feel free to reach out if you have any specific questions I have included a few photos to show have they have worn as most people probably travel less in a year then we do in a few months.Update 10DEC2019: After four years of heavy international travel, the luggage is intact with no surface punctures, broken zippers, or damaged interior... Highest recommendation.Purchased for international travel - a hard sided bag was the key driver for purchaseThe unit opens flat for packing - one side of the unit has a cover that can be zipped closed; the other has an adjustable strap that will secure the contents - A small pouch along the seam can be zipped shut and will hold small items.Initial Concerns at the time of purchase were:- the overall size of the unit and ability to pack enough clothes- Performance of the zipper- Durability of the wheels over timeAfter a year of use and approximately 12 international flights and a handful of trips on North America:- Exterior of the unit is performing well - only evidence of use is a half dozen scrapes and scratches- All handles are intact and functioning as expected- NSA lock performs well- Wheels function smoothly - the wheels and the mounts holding them to the luggage are robust- Zipper for the unit has performed without issueFrom a size standpoint, the unit is perfect for a 7-10 day trip which includes 2 pair of shoes, bath kit, 2 suit coats and three pair of slacks along with the assortment of casual clothes and undergarmentsWe have had this suitcase for about 3 months, my partner and I travel a lot for work and pleasure so I did some extensive research on the pros and cons of hard luggage vs soft and the different types of wheels etc. This Aero Delsey line was always one of the top rated and made just about every travel blog luggage rating list I saw.

Bought to transport full diving kit so I'm happy, but if just for normal clothes etc it might be a bit much :D Worth bearing in mind it can very easily go over plane weight limits without even being full, even just filling it with clothes can end up very heavy.The wheels are very sturdy so far, despite us having got lost and wheeled it around bumpy streets a couple of times that definitely would have broken other cases. And the TSA lock is a nice feature (but obviously not sure how much it would deter someone if they were very keen to get inside and had time). Overall very happy with it, keeps and protects a huge amount of luggage.I bought it because of its advertised small size. But it was the same size as my other. It was the only carry on with the extra third compartment with a nicely padded pocket for my laptop. I liked the expandable 2 inches for extra space. Strong and easy to move. It was however wrongly described as cobalt blue. It was rather dark midnight blue. In certain lights it had a hint of purple.I'm delighted.Pro's:","Pro's:

Suitable for 5-50gallon fish and turtle tank.. ?Two Types of Water Outlets?The fish tank internal filter has two types of outlets: Spray Bar and Duckbill Outlet, and both of which can be rotated 360�. There is an adjustable knob in the spray bar, which can adjust the water flow of the filter, and the adjustment range is 0-165GPH.. ?Three Filter Media, Four Filter Procedures?This fish tank filter has three kinds of filter media: 1pc Activated Carbon Cotton, 2pcs Biochemical Cotton and some Ceramic Balls. After the water enters the filter, it goes through four filter procedures to be completely filtered, then sprays out from the outlet.. ?Ultra Quiet Filter?For this new aquarium filter, we have improved the internal structure of the water pump to further enhance the sound insulation effect. Once the filter is placed in the water and the filter is turned on, you can hardly hear the sound of the motor, only the sound of the water spraying out. Noise Level<40dB.. ?Unique Design?The Internal filter has a unique appearance design and looks very distinctive. This filter adds a Minimum Water Level design. Put the filter into the water, pay attention to check that the water level cannot be lower than the Minimum Water Level. You can also completely immerse the filter in the water. And there are four strong suction cups in the filter, which can firmly install the filter in the fish tank without slipping off easily.My Beta loves it.Es el mejor filtro que he comprado no hace ruido y mantiene el agua limpiaI got this for my 10 gallon skrimp tank. Works perfectly. You can adjust the water out put.I installed this on my 40 breeder for surface agitation. and the filter is just a bonus. The water output is adjustable and very easy to set. The unit is a little difficult to get apart but I was able to do so without breaking it. Just use firm grip and pull out from the front and then the unit separates by again firmly pulling them apart. The clips should not break. I'll be looking for another one but smaller for my 29g. Super quiet day 1.It�s just about everything I need for a simple 19 gallon however, I hate how noisy mine is. I�m not sure if it�s just the motor on mine or what but it�s no longer peaceful in my animal room. Besides the sound it�s what I�ve been wanting.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Pvc,Cotton,Mesh. Accessories: 1 x canvas tent, 1 x center pole, 4 x door poles, 4 x rainproof caps, 14 x small stakes, 14 x large stakes, 14 x wind ropes, 1 x instructions.. Good ventilation: This tent comes with two large doors and four triangle-shaped windows, both doors and windows are equipped with mesh screens, which make the tent very cool in a lovely summer.. Stitching: Double stitching all around and reinforced key points.. Non-removable PVC ground sheet: The PVC floor is connected with the upper canvas cover by zippers, but it is non-removable.. Note: The wind ropes and stakes are required for setting up this tent. It needs a lawn of at least 26 ft*23 ft.What a great tent, we are very impressed. It was so easily set up and took us like no time at all. We did upgrade the tent stakes as the ones it came with were thin and easily bent. The ropes that were provided seem very sturdy. Once we put it up we wet it 4 times over the course of a week to aid in the waterproofing. The first wetting it had minimal leaving and by the 4th there was zero water coming in and we really hosed it down. We didn't need a wood stove hole as we use propane for heat which we use in our home when not burning the wood burner. We just went camping with it and again, super easy to set up and take down. For the money, this tent was superb...no need to spend $1000 on a tent.Edit..... We love love love our tent. It's got a big footprint so we have to do research for what campsite will fit us.We had high wind during our hunt and the tent held up with no problems.I've slept in this tent about 12 nights now. The first trip out, we got about 2 inches of rain in 30 hours. There was a little water intrusion, but not bad, especially for the first time getting wet. No issues since then, but no real rain either.Setup is really easy and quick. There's lots of room for multiple cots. Nice to open windows for air flow.Check out umbrella accessories for things to add to the center pole (lights, tables, clothes hooks).The only downside is this thing is HEAVY! I bought a Christmas tree storage bag to put it in. There was no way it was going back in three factory bag.This tent is not a 4 season tent if there isn't a way to heat in the winter propane puts out too much co it really needs a stove pipe flap so a wood stove or other type of stove be vented outsideThe tent leaks everywhere. The front door rods tore through The tent so i had to fix it.. I would give this a 5 star if it didnt leak. Its def not water resistant..

Sweatpants features elastic waist & deep pockets which is convenient to hold your large cell phone & keys. The inseam of the petite height is approximate 27"", the inseam of the regular height is approximate 29""I wear a size 12/14 pants and ordered a large on these. This usually works but not always. The large fits a bit tighter then I�d like however I�m still more near a size 14 then a 12 at the moment so I believe they are correctly sized. The length fits to the ankle and it�s just perfect (I�m 5�9 -5�10 approx) I should have just ordered the XL but in the process of losing weight. These are 100% cotton and I love having the two front pockets! These aren�t sweatpants to wear in colder weather like the sweatpants of old. They are thicker then leggings but not quite as thick as sweatpants I use to own. I do like that they don�t have the bottom banded as well. They are soft and I�d be extremely happy had I ordered an XL! I just wouldn�t recommend for cold weather but some may be okay with them in cooler weather. All together I like them, love 100% cotton, two front pockets and open leg at the bottom. I�m wearing now and comfy in A/C. I ordered black and grey and they are true to color on screen.I was looking for 100% cotton sweatpants and feel so lucky to find them for this reasonable price. The most important thing for me is the waistband is not too tight, does not pinch or cause abdominal discomfort. I�ve washed them once and the length does shrink about 1 inch. This is usual in a 100% cotton garment, so I wasn�t surprised. For me the comfort of 100% cotton is worth it. I�m 5�6 and 130-5 pounds and medium fits just right. You could have trouble if you have a well rounded JLo derri�re. Update: After a couple more washings they shrank a couple more inches in length and all around. I'm going to have to try large.These pants run large but will shrink considerably in the dryer! I am 5�2� 155 pounds and the medium pants (not petite) ran long and large in my hips/butt. They did shrink in the dryer and are slightly short now and fit better in the hips. They are well made, nice heavy material which makes them warm in the winter. Comfortable elastic waist and nice deep side pockets.I'm between 12 and 14 and the large fits comfy. Just wore these on return flight from Europe and couldn't be more comfortable. The material is thinner than some of the other sweat pants out there but I find them refreshing as warm but not too thick and heavy.I�ve only had these for a few months and A, they shrank a lot in length, and B, the knees have bagged out already.I should have read the reviews which made clear that they would shrink, so that�s my own fault. But the bagginess is the final straw.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Dark brown colored rustproof aluminum frame, which is very strong and sturdy, built with 4.7�x4.7"" triangular aluminum stand pole?much bigger and stronger than standard models. All materials are built to last, never becoming rusty or deformed.. Hard metal top instead of normal fabric or polycarbonate material.. Extremely durable PBV-coated polyester mosquito netting and removable steel railing on 4 sides. Double Track System allows you to add another layer of privacy sidewall. Include 2 layers sidewalls (mosquito set and strong 180gsm polyester solid sidewall). Better ventilated than one layer design. Galvanized steel roof strong enough to withhold heavy snow.. Better water gutter design to ensure rainwater always goes to the cornernanLet me start by saying that I absolutely LOVE this product! I like the design and the multiple ways the joints everything were reinforced to make it even more sturdy. My husband and I are used to doing assembly projects like this (and my dad was a contractor who taught me everything!) so this wasn't our first rodeo! We originally purchased a ""package"" to have someone assemble the product after it was delivered to our home. However, within a day or two of ordering, we received an email stating there was no one in our area that could put it together for us --- that actually saved us the additional $352.00 but we for sure then had to assemble it on our own. The following points are meant to be helpful feedback to the manufacturer and tips or ""lessons learned"" to any buyers.You definitely need a minimum of two people for assembly, two 6ft - 8ft A-frame ladders, and patience! We were completely able to assemble this ourselves but it took us a total of about 16 hours (over several different days) to get it all done. With both of us being about 60 yrs. old, the trips up and down the ladders and/or working up over your head can take a toll on knees and shoulders.The picture instructions were adequate but it sure would have been more helpful for them to include at least SOME words or helpful notes on some of the pages. I used one of those folding Allen wrench/Hex Key rubberized hand-held sets -- my hubby used a drill - guess who stripped out more screw heads? (hint --- not me!) Thankfully the manufacturer did include a FEW extra screws in each size needed. Definitely move the assembled posts with cross bar framing to the precise area you want it placed in before assembling the upper roof frame - it's much lighter at that point.IMPORTANT NOTE: You will also need a few ""drift pins"" or ""bull pins"" to help line up the pre-drilled holes, stick the pins into them at various key points, and then start putting in the fasteners. Otherwise, as you work dowNone foundcross the pieces you are joining, the holes may not line up and you have to go back and loosen others so that you can ""slide"" the pieces where you need them. This is especially true when working with the fasteners for the individual metal roofing pieces that overlap each other AND threaded through a rubber ""stopper"" then on through the final frame hole (3 or 4 different holes to line up)!The numerous little metal ""braces"" that you have to attach to every flat section of the metal roofing pieces too easily popped off while sliding them through the roof guides but still were effective in helping lock the roof pieces down when properly aligned.The vented top cap was really easy to install (after putting the first small sections of the metal roof on first). Very thoughtful of the designers to have two of the fasteners being large screw-in hooks so that you can hang something from the hooks in the ceiling (lights or plants or whatever).Again, I really am impressed with the sturdiness (reinforcements) and design of this product. My only ""complaint"" were the ""picture only"" type directions. It really wasn't that hard to assemble --- you ALWAYS need the RIGHT tools to make things go smoother (e.g. bull/drift pins!). And, I love the way it looks and functions on our new concrete patio!My wife and I have been looking for hard top Gazebo and after the reviews went with this one. We are in our 70s so forget about putting this together ourselves. (What a great move) We had the QualTek installers install the gazebo. Oh my it was worth every bit of the $351.27 we paid to have it installed. They came on time at 8am worked to 5pm but had a problem with two of the roof panels N1. I contacted the company and a wonderful customer service rep Stephy Hong got out two panels for me and had them in a couple of days. The installers came back today and finished the job. This gazebo is so sturdy the deck will have to blow away before it moves. The installer had some screws that he used to screw the legs down. We had to bungee cords the corners on the last gazebo so it would not blow away. This comes in two big boxes and the freight company delivered them in our back yard. Can't wait to start using my fantastic gazebo.Just had it up for two days and we had rain and wind and this morning looked at the panel and all four panel were ripped and frayed from the fabric. Don't know what I am going to do now. Emailed the company sent them the picture waiting to see what they are going to do. Whoever thought of those hooks were not thinking long term. The hooks tore right through the curtain with the net. Also the Velcro sticks to the netting. But in the wind the Gazebo did not move one inch. Rain did leak off the sides which I thought would not happen and leaked from the top of the Gazebo onto furniture.Latest update. Never heard from manufacturer on panel or screen so I figured out how to fix it. I reinforced each of the holes with Crystal Clear Gorilla Tape (make sure you read directions). Tape both sides of the panel holes. Then I took off one side of the Velcro strip the one that everything sticks to. I sewed Dretz Sew-On Snaps, snaps are about 3/4 inch so the are nice and big. Then I found ( Magnetic Curtain Tiebacks [Upgrade Verion] Best Curtain Holdbacks, Curtain Tie Backs, Tie Backs Curtain Holdback, Curtain Ties Backs Big Size 18.5 in and Adjust Length Freely - Pack 6 + 4 - Chocolate) on Amazon. These tie backs I wrapped them around the bottom of the panel. This helps hold the panel because the holder they give you keeps slipping down.All in all this is a fantastic Gazebo. Hoping we get many years of enjoyment.Sturdy structure. 12x10 is a perfect size. Construction was slightly difficult. Following directions is important. Must work slowly and methodically. Patience is required. This gazebo compliments any deck or patio. Very happy with this purchase.The predrilled holes are not very accurate, especially in the roof. It is so bad that the screws are unable to fit, so the roof is still unfinished. I�m not sure what I can do to fix this.Pro's:","Pro's:

Heavy duty fabric: Durable PU, UV blocker, UPF 50+, 100% waterproof. Suitable for both sunny and rainy days.. Set up in second: Super easy to set up with only 2 people. Roller bag for easy portability and light transportation. Heavy duty wheels glide smooth. Bonus 4 Canopy Sand Bags, 4 Stakes&Ropes for stable and sturdy use.. Multiple use occasions: Perfect tent for outdoor sports, event, festival, flea market, party, beach, play ground. (Better check the length of the canopy fit your trunk of the car or not before purchase.. One year after-sale protection for frame, six months after-sale protection for fabrics and accessories. If you have any issue during using our products, please feel free to contact us.This canopy is a game-changer! I have put up a lot of canopies over the years. We loved our last canopy (can't remember manufacturer), and it was great quality; the frame lasted for years, even through a replacement cover. THIS one is all that and more. Frame is great quality construction & weight. The cover is also great quality, with the nice features you want, such as the Velcro corners, and inner linings to all support features (i.e., all inner ties, the Velcro, etc., are attached to a separate reinforced fabric piece to prevent the ties from ripping the actual cover.). There is even a fabric piece at the peak which ties (with good give for movement in wind) to the frame to help center the canopy and hold it in place. And the absolute best part of the frame is the center support post and base bracket (see pics). Once you have the canopy properly placed and preliminarily attached, you can push up on the base of the center support and the canopy goes almost up to where you need it to lock the top corners. They actually did think of everything.I was able to put up this whole assembly by myself (I am a 5'4"" female). AND a great price along with the quality. This is honestly the only canopy I will ever purchase now. COMPLETELY RECOMMEND!nanFirst, I'll start by saying this canopy is excellent. I don't believe there is a better canopy on the market for the price. If you need something very lightweight and not very heavy duty, then look elsewhere. If you want something that will actually last, built on a true steel frame, get this canopy.I've done festivals, trade-shows, and outdoor markets of all kinds for the better part a year under this canopy, with an average use rate of three days per week. I often feel bad for many other canopy users, because their canopies limit them so severely. Your canopy is the bedrock of your setup, it supports your banners, your windwalls, your lights, and anything else you might need, and it does it all while resisting the elements. If you build your foundation on lightweight aluminum, then you haven't accounted for all the other factors in addition to Murphy's Law. I would advise everyone to get this canopy unless they are under a festival ordnance that requires another tent for uniformity purposes (very rare, but I've seen this happen, IMO this SHOULD be the tent required in those circumstances). This frame will withstand high winds with large banners and signed attached to it, each leg supports two proper stakes, and the wide base feet are ideal for use with weight bags.I have absolutely no trouble at all setting this up alone, and taking it down alone. I've done it probably close to 150 times. The trick is to place one corner where you want it, grab the opposite corner, lift, and stretch it into place. Once it is mostly expanded, press upward on the slider until it clicks into place, then click into place all the other corners. After that you simple lift each leg one at a time. I truly do not understand the people saying this is a difficult setup ""even for two people."" It's exceptionally easy for one person. Perhaps using more than one person unnecessarily complicates setup? In any case, when you take it down you do the same thing in reverse. First lower all four legs. Then unfasten the corner buttons. Grab one leg on any side, lift, and walk it toward the opposite leg. The entire tent will simply fold up. After that, bag the tent by swinging the bag behind your back, and applying it by sliding it over the top of your head onto the tent. This effectively guides the bag over the tent so that it can slide down onto the bag unhindered. The whole operation of take down or set up takes me easily less than three minutes moving at a normal pace.In addition, they do honor their manufacturer's warranty. I work mostly in Florida near the gulf, and we get very high wind gusts from time to time that can't be predicted. After six months of the harshest environment and repeated set ups and tear downs, the frame finally buckled slightly and could not fold up fully. This was a problem because it would not fit into the bag nor into our storage area for travel. They honored the one year warranty, refunded the cost, and sent a replacement. I almost felt bad because I can tell that every effort has been made for this design to be durable and affordable, and I don't like to take advantage of warranties in those circumstances if I can avoid it. However they gave absolutely no fuss.Now, with that said, understand that there are two, seemingly identical carrying bags for this canopy. My original canopy came with an incredibly heavy duty bag that looked exactly like that displayed in the images in the listings. When I received my second canopy, the bag was a complete joke. It looked identical to the original in every way, but was probably 1/5 the thickness and very poorly manufactured. It fell apart within two weeks. I'm not exaggerating. The first bag lasted six months and was still in near perfect condition, the second lasted only two weeks. The moment I received the new bag I immediately knew it was inferior quality, but I didn't realize just how bad it was until I had a chance to put it to use.So if you see reviews of some people enamored with the bag quality, and others complaining about how poor the exact same bag is, understand that it's because there are two versions of the bag. Which one you receive appears to be 100% luck of the draw. I've been looking for a way to purchase the quality version but the Amazon listing for the bag only appears to suffer the same problem - the seller called ""#1 Instant Shelter"" randomly distributes one version or the other, and most customers have no idea this is taking place. Shame on them for not being more transparent in this regard.I know pictures can't speak to the actual quality, but this pop up was truly worth every penny. I was also looking at the Euromax pop up but I am really glad I went with the ABC Canopy. Can one person set it up? Yes. It's a little awkward and takes about 20 minutes the first time, but I did it just to see if I could. Then the next time I had help and it went up in 10 minutes with the top on and everything velcro'ed down.A note on the canopy itself: when comparing to smaller and cheaper pop ups it's just not even in the same league. It is really heavy duty. Again, I know the picture makes it look like it's light weight material but it's thick and strong.The bag was really nice. It has a large exterior pocket big enough to house the tie down stakes and the canopy. The wheels are kind of small but worked over the grass as I dragged it from the car.Listen, this baby is HEAVY! But that's what I wanted. It's heavy because it's heavy duty!The pop up came with sand bags but I just used the tie downs with stakes. I added some hand sewn flags to make it look a little more fun. I used this pop up for two weeks of camping and in that time we saw a LOT of rain. Also high winds. The pop up was solid. Even in the high wind it's heavy enough and when properly tied down, it just impressed the heck out of me. I can't recommend enough.YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!I bought this canopy for use at events/festivals. I have a snack company and have been tired of flimsy, low, poor quality EZup type canopy�s this whole year. After much research and deliberation I couldn�t be happier with my decision to go with the ABC Canopy. It seems to have tremendous quality and is very sturdy. I can set this baby up all by myself and roll her around town! The travel case is also incredibly convenient and has a large exterior pocket for signs and such.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Polyester. imported. Two door / Two vestibule layout. Two person layout. Three season, fre standing tent. Tent fly ventilation windows. Bathtub floor constructionWent on 4 backpacking trips in the US. This tent is perfect for the soloist or a team. Nice amount of room, very light and pack able. I love the canopy it provides with the rain fly to protect your pack and boots or whatever gear you want to leave outside the tent close by. Very good ventilation and strong construction. If you shop REI ask them about this tent, the 3 shops I went to were surprised at the price and speak highly of this tent.Edit: the pics on the dock. I was treating the tent with permethrin spray. Excellent stuff if you don't want to be bothered with ticks, spiders or mosquitoes. Spray it on the outer clothes you plan on wearing and spend a week in the wilderness without worry.We've been using this tent for a few years now and it's as good as new after maybe 20-30 nights of camping. It's super well ventilated....which might not be idea if super windy....but otherwise we really like it. We've camped in temps down to the teens and in warm environments. The best part about it is how easily it sets up and packs. There's no need to fold it as it stuffs easily in the bag. And the clip on (high quality aluminum) exterior poles are the only way to go for ease of set up after a long day of backpacking! We'd buy this one again in a heartbeat. (If it ever wears out!)I�ve bought 2 of these. The tents are awesome. I bought one back in 2016 for my PCT hike.. it was large enough to house my self & my brother comfortably (with extra room to spare for pack storage via outside vestibules). The item can be setup in an avg of 5-10mins by yourself. I know because we got trapped on the top of the mountain in the middle of the night with a rain storm pounding on us. The item is durable & last years without any maintenance. Although i do recommend a footprint just for a bit of extra protection on the bathtub. Seams held up great, no leaks & they�re strong enough to maintain the weight of hanging items. Strong winds barely affect this tent the design/shape allow a majority of the wind to roll over the top. You will probably want to change out the stakes; they are not strong enough to slam into hardened ground� i swapped them out for titanium stakes (way stronger &lighter). The reason i bought 2 is because i traded my 1st one with a buddy for the 1P tent from mountainsmith (another excellent product), i just happen to be hiking alot more solo & therefore did not need the added space or weightIt's been awhile since I have slept in a tent so it might be a little difficult to compare it to other products. I tested this tent out for a couple of nights while camping at the beach. I wanted a tent with aluminum poles and not fiberglass. I narrowed it down to this tent and other one. I choose the Mountainsmith one because it was made in the USA while the other was made in China.First thing first, I set up the tent. I read reviews that is was pretty quick. It might have taken me 15 minutes the first time. Everything was so simple. I laid the tent out, staked the corners down, places the two poles across the tent, hooked them on with the hooks(I loved the hooks, it made putting the poles in place so easy), and the snapped in the rain fly. I can imagine the next time I do it, it would probably taken under 10 minutes. My only problem was the stakes. One of them broke while I was hammering it in. I'm going to buy some replacement ones that are more sturdy for next time.I borrowed my parents queen size air mattress thinking it would fit. I thought I read a review saying one does. We pumped it up in the motorhome and then brought it out to place in the tent. I must say I didn't think it would fit. but after bending and squeezing it somehow got in. It was an extremely tight fit and I decided next time I am getting a smaller size or something else. I'm 6'3"" and my body length barely fit in the tent. I assume it would fit better if I didn't have such a huge air mattress in there.Overall the tent did it's job. It was a little chilly overnight, but the tent seemed to keep it warmer than it was outside. There was a little morning dew on the outside of the tent but nothing got in since the rainfly was on. I can imagine if it rained it would keep me dry. The only thing that might be a problem was that after the sun came up and shined on the tent it got hot fast. I am planning a trip to Zion National Park in June and am worried it might get a little toasty in the tent if it becomes really hot. I really enjoyed using this tent and I can't wait to use it again in a few months. I would totally recommend it for one person who wants to be nice and cozy or two people if you don't mind being a little close.Arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Upon arrival, I set it up without using the instructions. Took a couple of minutes and was the easiest set up I have ever encountered! Went up without a hitch. Color coded poles an connectors make it so easy to set up. I set this up in my living room as I was so excited to see if it really was as easy as others have mentioned. It was free standing in a couple of minutes. It is larger than I expected and fit two 6ft individuals with ease. Top panels are screens so you can view the stars and keep the bugs out during clear sky nights without the rain cover installed. Pockets on the inside corners are great for placing items needed during the night. There are two zippered doors, one on either side. The bottom is tubbed-up about 6 inches and made of durable material.The only down-side is the weight. If you are looking for an ultralight tent, this is not the one. At around 5lbs, I think it is worth the extra weight for it's simplicity and ruggedness.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 1.?Solid Wood?This frame is made of New Zealand Pine that is different from the one made of ordinary wood or wood chips.

Using the environmentally friendly paint, it�s safe and no harmful to health.. 2.?HD Glass?With high-quality polished glass, it has high transparency. Give a crystal-clear view of your picture and help you to freeze the precious moments.. 3.?Multifunction? It can be placed on the table or hung on the wall horizontally or vertically, depending on your photo orientation. 3 expansion screws will be given as a free gift, which makes the frame more stable. Based on your demands, you can purchase a variety of different sizes frames. Placing these frames by yourself, you will feel warm atmosphere added in your home.. 4.?Installation?The unique card slot is designed on the frame back. So this frame is more sturdy.. 5.?Size of frame?11""x 14"" without mat or 8"" x 10"" / 9"" x 12"" with mat. A piece of frame mat is affiliated to every photo frame, which meets your needs.I needed a frame for this 9x12 print I received for Father's Day. After looking at several frames on Amazon, I settled on this frame. The photographs and the description of the frame are most accurate. Firstly, the frame came well packaged directly in the manufacture's box, wrapped in bubble wrap with foam protective corners at each corner of the frame in the box. Secondly, the rear of the frame is not at all similar to those other much more inexpensive frames with the those metal stays that you have to bend back and forth to mount the print. The back of the frame is made of a very sturdy wooden material with sliding stays that swivel allowing you to mount your print. Of course, teh frame comes with a built in stand as well as mounting loops to mount on the wall. Quite surprisingly the frame came with two screws and plastic butterflies should you need to make holes in a wall.As to the frame itself, the frame is most sturdy and is made of wood that comes with a glass (not plastic). Two separate mats come with the frame. I opted to use the 12X9 and it worked PREFECTLY.....I am MOST satisfied with this product and with this purchaseI purchased this frame in order to frame a piece of artwork that I created for a local, annual art auction that raises money for charity. I like to work in the 9x12 size which is sometimes a more pesky size to find a frame for. I purchased this frame in white and used the matte that allowed for the most room for the picture to show. I painted the frame gold and it worked like a dream! The frame got some compliments too! I think it�s a great value and arrived well-packed.Put our art in them and hung them up - I'm pleased.I would just add that the mats are a white that is toward blue/gray on the spectrum of whites, in case you care.This review is for Beyond Your Thoughts Wood + Real Glass (Hang/Stand) 11""X14"" Black Picture Photo Frame with Matted for 8""X10"" or 9""x12"" Photo. I am impressed with this frame after purchasing for $13.99. I didn't expect too much but my frame came tightly packed inside a box with styrofoam protecting each corner. The frame isn't heavy but feels like a quality weight frame. Mine came with what appears to be real glass. And it has the easel style back so you can hang it or set it on a shelf or something. I bought this primarily based on size and price point as it is going to display a child's artwork. Honestly, upon opening I began to think this is too nice of a frame for a coloring picture. I'm extremely pleased with this frame.I really hate buying frames online as you really can�t get a sense of the quality, the heft, or the assembly. I was incredibly pleased to get this frame as it is a quality wood product, with a nice piece of glass and very nice hardware and overall production. Definitely worth some money. Plus getting the two extra mats totally seals the deal. Make sure you have your dimensions correctly for your opening size and frame size. I will be back for more as these really are a nice frame for the money and look much more expensive than the out-of-pocket cost.Pro's:","Pro's:

Frames Larger than 8x10 come with UV Filtering .040 US Made Plexiglass.. Black 1 Inch Flat, Wood Composite MDF Wall Decor Picture & Poster Frame. Frame includes: 0.040 Acrylic, Cardboard Backer and Hanger installed on both sides. It can hang either way. On return 20% restocking charges will be applied.The frame is great! Except, the acrylic face is obvious and a little distracting. That part looks cheap. The rest of the frame looks fine.UPDATE: I failed to remove the protector sheet on the other side of the acrylic screen. Once removed, it is visually not distinguishable to me from glass.I needed some inexpensive frames for some of my son's artwork and came across these on Amazon. Although they are not solid wood they look very nice and the size was exact. They are very light weight so I'll be able to use 3M hangers and not damage my wall, even though they do come with picture hanging hardware. I am very happy with my purchase for the quality and price, so I'll be ordering a few more.We ordered this frame for a numbered piece of art we purchased at a gallery along with another size for another numbered piece of art. We didn�t want a huge frame with a mat surround. I wanted a classic black frame that would fit around this art without spending a fortune as it is difficult to hang the art in a multi stairwell. This was the only frame I could find that had the correct size and weight I needed. The price is marked up and the quality doesn�t match the price, however it works for what I wanted.The frame itself came in quality packaging and was super easy to place art into and the plastic coating on the plexiglass was well thought out. I simply unpacked the frame, layer it out on our dining table onto a beach towel. I picked up the plexiglass and removed the visual side of the plastic coating and placed it into its frame again without putting finger prints on it. Then I gently picked the corner leaving it in the frame and pulled it back with my other hand on the bottom part of the plastic coating and never made contact with my fingers to keep it clean. I place my artwork face down and made sure the hook on the back and the artwork was in the correct position. I put the cardboard backing on and closed all the little pegs. Hung and I love it!The frame quality is fine and the price was reasonable, but it's not 16x28. When I tried to put my poster that *is* 16x28 (measured at least twice to be sure before purchasing) in it, it was too large. I measured the cardboard backing and it's off by half an inch in both length and width, which meant I had to trim the edges of the poster.I am keeping the frame because my clumsy trimming is not noticeable at all once in the frame and it does look nice on the wall, but I am disappointed by the inaccurate dimensions, especially when this is not a standard size.Before I ordered my frame, I read the reviews to see what people were saying about this frame. some were good and some were not. But I wanted that frame but I didn't want the problems that the the reviews that were not good to happen to me. In good faith, I ordered the frame and they contacted to me about security for my package for the delivery. I was actually impressed. I told them among other things, that I needed them to secure the delivery by way of making sure they packaged this frame so that it would not be damaged. They responded ""sure we will."" I wasn't feeling that answer but I decided to let it go and trust that their word would be true. A week later I received my frame and I was ecstatic to see that it was in pristine condition.As careful as I was I scratched it thankfully the picture in it hides it so. over all I am thrilled because it looks beautiful. Nicely done. thank you!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Full padding on the front and back of the wrist promotes proper technique; Foam padding boxing gloves use latex and PVC foam with shock absorber.

Velcro wrist closure; Easy to put on and take off; Secure fit and excellent wrist support. Great bag boxing gloves for both men and women, beginners to advanced boxers; Comfortable to wear during trainings. Help win the games.. Ideal for mixed martial arts MMA, fighting, cardio, sparring, bag work and shadow boxing, Maui Thai, TrainingI like the gloves. They fit snug around my wrist which provides extra support, but the gloves are big. I purchased these not knowing they were a size 16oz. The smallest size is 8oz, and in this color they only had 16oz available. So I�ve had to buy another smaller pair in the gray and black. I will keep these for others who may train with me with bigger hands, and I love the red and black color, but unfortunately I�ll have to settle for the gray and black due to the misinformation. Still a nice glove though, just wish I�d received a smaller size in this color.These gloves are pre-curved yet they hold your hand slightly open. When you try to clench your hand and make a tight fist, it's work for your hand and your hand becomes tired just from fighting the stiff materials in the glove. The padding in the glove isn't soft and pliable and doesn't form to your hand OR the fist you are trying to make. This is yet another cheap, foreign made product from you know where! No wonder I don't use Amazon that much. I end up sending most of the junk back. DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMENDED!Very light-weight, easy to break in, and fit great for people with small wrists!I use these about 1-2 times a week in my boxing classes with teardrop water bags. Once I broke them in (took about 3-4 times to fully do so), they came to be my favorite pair of gloves I've owned so far!nanGood buy for the price I Box casually for exercise.

Professionally designed to offer protection when training and sparring, the bigger gloves are furnished with extra padding and offer higher protection.Have been involved in kickboxing and MMA for 25 years, wanted some cheep gloves for a student. I was stunned at the quality for the price. I usually buy from ringside, these are of comparable quality for half the price! I have yet to see how they hold up but they are sewn well .I will report back.After reading one of the reviews and comparing them to a well known-brand; I decided to give them a try. I purchased other brands of gloves over the past 10 years. You can easily spend a lot of money on gloves.I use them 4-5 days a week for my boxing, kicking boxing, and Muay Thai classes. I also do pad work with a partner. So I do get a lot of use out of any gloves. I needed something durable since I know I would use them a lot.I�m a female who is 5�3� and I purchased 16 oz. They do look big on me, but I needed this size. I usually wear 180� hand wraps.My first week using them; I wasn�t sure I liked them or not because at times I could feel the shock when I was punching the bag. After using them for a few weeks, I didn�t feel the shock. I guess I had to break them.They are not as costly as the other well-known brands. I do recommend them and will purchase them again.These gloves are of great quality!! The fit is amazing; giving full support of your hands and wrists, as well as being adjustable around the wrist (large, Velcro bands). I've tried several boxing gloves as of late, after using MMA style gloves the past couple of years, and these are very nice, for the money. I haven't trued the $100+ types out there, but for $40 these are going to suit my needs just fine. They're durable, supportive, and the fit is perfect (16 oz) for me. I would recommend these to anyone who needs boxing gloves for your typical kickboxing classes, or if you're working out at a boxing class gym environment, ot just at home. They do get their abuse, about 5-6 days a week, and are holding up well.I cannot speak yet to the durability of these gloves as I have had them for only a brief period of time. I was pleasantly surprised with the good quality of these gloves after first opening them from their package. They seem to be well made and the distinctive smell of leather was apparent right away when opening. They do seem to be more suited for hitting a bag vs. sparring as they are quite firm when new, although well padded. They are easy to take on and off. I have small and short fingers and they fit just right. They did not fit well on the finger length for my 24 year old son, who has longer fingers but not exceptionally long though. He said that his fingers felt cramped inside the end of the glove. These definitely get hot inside so your hands will sweat. There isn't much venting for the heat to dissipate. I think that these gloves will definitely break in well, as real leather usually does, so they should only get more comfortable. With all the options out there for gloves that are not the bottom of the line or top of the line, but somewhere in the middle, I feel that these gloves are a good value for the quality that you get with them. Hopefully they will also be durable and last long through moderate use and with proper usage and care.I�ve ordered 3 pairs just trying to make a matching pair. The thumbs are sewn inconsistently. I�ve finally got a left that fits really well. About to exchange for a fourth pair to try again. It shouldn�t be this hard to get a matching pair, right?! I can�t speak for the durability as I�ve not really had a chance to use them but if it�s anything like their quality control I�m not optimistic.The glove that was sewn correctly fits well. Felt really tight at first especially with their wraps(totally different review). Like a tight shoe but I found it felt really nice on the heavy bag.I hope they last and will def update the review either way when I have a matching pair that I�m able to actually use.

Text: The best boxing glove brand you can ever choose. Recommended for sparring, heavy bags and training in general.. Designed with the finest craftsmanship and highest quality material handmade from Mexico. Manufactured under a strict of the very best kind control in leather and all the materials.. The long-lasting latex foam padding gives your knuckles the support they need and a great effect in every punch, while the water repellent linings prevent moisture from entering the padding and keeps the glove weight constant.. The Training Gloves with Hook & and Loop closure have an attached thumb which prevent eye injuries and keep the thumb from being broken or sprained while training.. Weight suggested by professional trainers: 12oz until 129 lbs, 14oz for 130 to 159 lbs, 16oz and 18oz for 160 lbs. and up.Ive been boxing(casually) for over a decade, never fought in the amateurs because i run a business and dont have the time to dedicate to it. But i do fight once a year in cheesy 'toughman' style boxing matches. Ive owned various brands of boxing gloves over the years from Title, Everlast, offbrand, etc. These are the tightest and most compact 16oz boxing gloves ive ever owned. They weren't kidding when they said these were 'puncher' gloves. Its a struggle to get my hands into them and im not a big guy(5'7 142 pounds). These are so compact that they make me feel like a pro fighter. They feel and look like 14 oz gloves, its crazy, and it feels crazy good on my ego because im able to punch harder and faster with these than any other 16 oz gloves ive ever owned. Its like ive been driving a truck all my life and suddenly switched to a super car like a Ferrari. Slick gloves, love'em, hope they hold up over the years like all the rumors says.Cons- The thumb on these gloves is very short, my thumb usually smashed on the end and it does get uncomfortable. Although i do have unnaturally large and lanky hands/fingers for being 5 foot 7 inches. I suppose Mexicans have stubby fingers or something. Also the thumb connector that keeps the thumb in place is kinda loose and your thumb will wiggle around more than other gloves. I even missed a punch on the heavybag and caught the thumb and that really hurt. I prefer my thumb sown on seamlessly onto the entire glove and not just a little half an inch leather piece holding it in place. Thats the only real 'con' i have for this glove, the thumb could be a whole lot better.I purchased these gloves for my husband 2 years ago, and just purchased them again this Christmas for him. My husband and I box and do kickboxing every day. He sweats very heavily, and is a hard hitter. He goes through cheaper gloves the way other people go through packs of toilet paper. If you buy him a $50 pair of gloves, you're going to be buying him new ones in 2 months. I got really tired of that, and of trying different brands to see if any could hold up for more than 5 months without disintegrating. So, I bought him these exact gloves, and here I am, only replacing them TWO YEARS later! These gloves are absolutely worth the price tag, but they're especially worth it if you are a heavy hitter, or a heavy sweater. The velcro is easy on and off, and the extra padding version is nice if you hit really hard. They don't need breaking in, either, which is really nice if you have to jump right into training.These are classy looking gloves, and they'll impress anybody who knows what is what. In my opinion, the only gloves that are better than Cleto's, are Winnings, and they're even more expensive, and ONLY are lace-up.If you buy these gloves, you won't regret it.I dinged this review by 1-star, largely so that if anyone else is buying a pair of purple gloves they may happen to see this review amongst all of the other 5-star ones. The grape color (like Barney purple) is an older style in the 14oz size, and the new purple is a very dark plum color. If you are specifically ordering this because you couldn�t find the Barney-purple anywhere else, clarify with the seller before you make the purchase that the color in the ad is actually what you will be getting. I purchased this same 14oz pair on eBay from a similar type of seller, using the same item listing image, and had the exact same issue, so apparently the factory is making a new version of purple that anyone shipping the product may not recognize is not the version of purple shown in many ads. In the picture I have included, the pair on the left is what I received when I purchased the �purple� color through this listing. The glove on the right is the color pictured in the ad (and is one of my 12oz pair).So, once you get past the color issue, there are not a ton of reviews written by women for these gloves, so if you may be on the fence, there are some points to consider. I used pink Everlast gloves for almost a decade and each lasted about 2 years of 5-7 hours of practice a week. I now have slightly messed up hands, so I couldn�t decide if I should buy these Cleto Reyes gloves or a Winning pair which are really good for people with injured hands because it�s like punching with a very pretty, very expensive, fluffy pillow.Since I couldn�t decide, I purchased both, with the grape color I wanted in the Cleto Reyes coming from a different site (and 12oz, not 14oz) and the purple Winning purchased on Amazon. I read a lot of reviews first, but until I actually had the chance to wear the gloves the reviews were not overly helpful. The best way I can describe the Cleto Reyes gloves is that they are a highly satisfying way to punch bags and people. They make this really fantastic slapping thud on the bag, and when you�re sparring, you feel the punches connect in a way that a more padded glove doesn�t give you. If you don�t have injured hands and you�ve been in the sport awhile, these gloves will make you smile, and maybe giggle in glee a little bit the first time you get to use them. I also did not have any issue with the different thumb placement that I have read about, although that is another reason it�s good to try them on before you buy them if that is an option.That being said, if you are new to the sport, using these gloves for all of practice is a good way to hurt your hands. If you�ve been in the sport awhile and you have somewhat messed up hands, it�s tough to put these away and use a more cushioned glove for longer workouts, but your hands will thank you. Also, depending on how hard your gym spars, these gloves are either awesome if you don�t like your training partners, or unnecessarily painful for the people you spar with, particularly if you are training for a fight and going at 70-80%. It�s like being hit with a pretty-colored, leather-covered brick. If you fight with them, you should still use them, but have someone wearing them hit you first so you know what the difference feels like.So�if you are set on the Barney-purple color, ordering it off this listing probably will not get you that color and you are going to be super bummed when you open the box. That is the only reason I dropped the review by a star. If you happen to be a woman buying these gloves, read the reviews, try them on first if you can, and don�t listen to anyone that has an opinion about whether or not buying �puncher�s gloves� makes you more awesome. You can knock someone out with pillows just as easily with the right technique, and if these feel like they are going to hurt your hands, remember that the other 22 hours of your day that you�re not at practice would appreciate if you can still bend your fingers in a few years.I could go on and on about these gloves. Everyone at my gym loves these and wishes they had them. They feel like clouds on my fist and hit like bricks. Speaking of which rumors have it that some gyms don't allow these since they hit so hard. The logo has started to come off but that is only natural since I train 5 days a week 2 hours a day. Dont waste your money on 50-80$ gloves and just make the commitment and buy these! You wont regret it I swear.When I started boxing, I was told by my instructor that the gloves didn't really matter yet since I was new. My advice to those who are beginning boxers/kickboxers is go ahead and invest in some quality gloves. The first gloves I bought didn't provide nearly the support (especially in the wrist) as the Cleto Reyes. Some of the reviews talk about them being stiff and hard to break in. I didn't feel that they were overly stiff and went and trained the same day I received them. They felt AMAZING right away. I truly love these gloves and Cleto Reyes lives up to their reputation for quality boxing equipment. They now have me as a customer for life.Pro's:","Pro's:

All the installation service from order page is from thrid party!. We offer limited time warranty against manufacturing defect for our product: 5 years for hardtop roof, and 1 year for frames constructions and Curtains & netting.This project was relatively easy to put together and it looks and functions Awesomely. I installed ours as the center place in our large vegetable garden. A great addition for sitting in the shade and out of the rain while watching things grow.There are a lot of parts but it wasn't difficult or challenging to assemble, and certainly not as complex as building a pavilion from scratch. The design and manufacturing is nice and spot on. The instructions were clear and all parts fit perfectly and logically. The packing designer/engineer is a genius to get everything so nicely into just four boxes. I used an electric driver to tighten the hundreds of hex nuts, which was way faster than using the supplied Allen wrenches. I recommend either getting long bits or use an extender so the driver chuck clears structure in a few places. Also, this is aluminum, so set the torque to a very low setting.I did the entire project by myself (solo) and didn't have much difficulty. I used a couple of ladders to prop things against a few times while building the structure. It would have been even more of a snap if I had a helper to just hold things (anyone able & comfortable to be on a ladder up to ~6' that could just have held a light part while I tightened it). That said, it only took me maybe 4-6 hours to build the structure then another 8 or so to put on the roofing (lots of bolts).I build my 12'x20' pavilion on pier blocks, that I installed after I built the structure because I wasn't 100% sure where the six pillars would rest. I was able to shift the entire pavilion around as I wanted to get it situated before I anchored it to the blocks. My concern will be our heavy winds lifting the pavilion, so I anchored into the conical blocks and packed dirt to the top. That should provide 1000s of pounds of lift resistance.Customer service was very helpful with delivery. There are 4 large boxes (each <140lbs). I only received 3 boxes in the original delivery. I contacted Purple Leaf late on a Friday, they got right back to me several times over the weekend and tried to track the missing box (box #3 - one of the roofing boxes). When the box wasn't found in the shipping warehouses, they promptly shipped me the missing #3 box. It was very smooth for me. I had everything I needed to build the structure in boxes #1 & #2, so I just did that and was ready for the roofing when it arrived.I have run electrical and a dedicated internet line out to the structure so now we have wifi in the garden. In hindsight I would have run the lines up inside the columns, that would have been very slick and not to difficult to do.I'm very happy with this pavilion so far, look forward to many years of maintenance free enjoyment, and would recommend it to others.Lavs@peak.orgThe gazebo is huge and heavy. It includes very, very thin side curtains. It works fine in fair weather, but will have to be modified for rain. Joints need calking and the curtains are incapable of fending rain or wind, so will have to be replaced by better items. The rest seems to be adequate to the task.The biggest problem with the gazebo is the arrogance of Purple Leaf providing zero assistance to their customers. They evidently feel that once you've paid them that their obligation to you is terminated. Where you might expect the purchase to be a transaction in which customer and seller engage in a relationship whereby you provide monetary support and they provide goods and services. Purple Leaf provides boxes of stuff. Beyond that, they can't be bothered with anything like support. Whereas you might expect that they are selling you a.kit, they see themselves as having no responsibility in helping you to use the box of parts to build the final product. To my way of thinking, their attitude is arrogant and should not be tolerated. So, be warned: these people have nothing but disdain for you.The boxes come loaded with an assortment of boxes. Opening the boxes, the first thing you will notice is that there are no instructions. There is a new pieces of paper upon which are printed very, very basic CAD drawings - the kind of output that programmers put out for free as they were learning how to use the primitive graphics in early home computers. A page gives the viewer a rough schematic of assmebled parts with each part labeled with a number. The boxes contain metal sheets with corresponding labels attached to each one and some bolts and nuts, etc. There is no progression to the CAD drawings that explain construction. There is no reference to a detailed instruction manual or video on line. If you assembled your gazebo according to what is very roughly represented in the CAD drawings, you would wind up with a fair amount of twisted metal. So, at the outset you need at least some basic sense of how to build a house - that is, how to erect the framing and roof. You also need to be careful with pieces bolt together. Judging by the reviews many people miss subtle connections that probably should have been explained, but hey, it would have cost Purple Leaf an extra half penny per unit to print out even the most primitive hint.All in all, my wife and I put it togher in a few days. We reasoned out how to build the initial frame not from the CAD drawings, but from some limited experience and reasoning out that one couldn't very well leave metal framing hanging by a couple of bolts. There were a few challenges that would have been very easy to explain had it not have cost Purple Leaf a few cents. But hey, why would you spend those precious couple of years getting an MBA and not used lessons learned to squeeze a couple more pennies out of the customer. It is not like we customers are going to be buying a lot of these gazebos. It is especially true that this particular customer would ever buy anything from Purple Leaf again. Why support a company that is not going to return any support to the customer.Look elsewhere. The gazebo design is not radically different than any other. If the customer comments complain about the lack of instructions, assume that the proprietors are not going to support you. It isn't inconvenient to assemble a gazebo with no instructions. You can do it. It is the idea that you are supporting people that are so arrogant that they deem you unworthy of their time or respect.We love this gazebo! It is much sturdier than we thought it would be based on some of the reviews. It looks beautiful and is very well made. My husband and I put most of this up ourselves (we are in our 60s). Our daughter helped with the roof panels, but that was the easy part! We were amazed that everything fit PERFECTLY! IKEA would be jealous! Whoever designed this thought of everything. It is engineered very well and some pieces are made to be adjustable to make lining the holes up easy. Everything was marked and nothing was missing. TIP: I would not remove a single bolt from the packaging it is on until you are using it. It is very easy to mix those up and then you�ll be in trouble. Also, don�t tighten the roof bolts so tight that you dent the roof! Keeping the clips on the edges of the roof panels was a little tricky. I ended up duct taping them with a thin strip of tape over the tabs to keep them in place. It was a little time consuming, but then the job went much faster and smoother.We had decided to replace our existing gazebo that had a canvas top. It was a very high quality gazebo, but we were tired of removing and replacing the cover every season. It also didn�t have a vented roof, so it got unbearably hot. I was beginning to regret that decision until we installed this one. It is very good quality and looks beautiful. We have no regrets!nannanPro's:","Pro's:

Text: This 16""x20"" frame perfectly showcases your favorite photos, posters, or art prints.. Profile of each frame is 1. 125"" wide with a gray woodgrain finish. Each frame is made of MDF wood with plastic styrene front to prevent breakage. Frames include pre-attached sawtooth hangers for vertical or horizontal wall hanging. Easy to open turn buttons make adding your photograph a breezenanThese are perfect frames. I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color. Overall I'm happy with the purchase! Doesn't look or feel like cheap frame material, so I think it's worth the price.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Nominal size: 16x20x1; Actual size 15 3/4""x 19 3/4"" x 3/4""; This MERV 13 filter is comparable with MPR 1500-1900 & FPR 10.. Designed to filter microscopic particles such as lint, dust mites, spores, pollen, pet dander, fine dust, smoke, viruses, and bacteria. Simple to install and a cost-effective step towards a healthier home environment. For best results, change your filters every 60 to 90 days but increase frequency to 30 days during peak summer and winter months. 100% synthetic electrostatic media for high efficiency with low air flow resistance. Manufactured in the USA by Filtration Group, a world-leading manufacturer and supplier of filtration solutions making the world safer, healthier & more productiveThese filters have cost me a lot of money! I ordered these a while back 4 1/2 months ago to be exact. I started using them 2 months ago. I came home 7 weeks ago to a very hot house. Went out and the A/C was frozen up. I unthawed it and called a A/C company to figure out what was going on. Everything checked out. Went 2 weeks with cooler weather and everything was great. It got hot again and it froze up again. I called a different company and everything was fine. A total of 4 companies and over $700 in service call fees I finally figured it out on my own. It was frozen up and I let it unthaw again and took out the filter and put back in a cheap one and have had no problems. I�ve called 2 of the companies and met them to show them the filters and they said to never purchase again. It wasn�t allowing air to flow because they were to thick and are not made of materials to filter. Smh. Amazon should refund me every dollar with the money they make ripping people off with such junk.I ordered these for the first time in 16x20x1 in a 4 pack.Cons: I was surprised they weren't individually wrapped in plastic.Pros: These are ""cheap"" filters, but that's exactly what I wanted. If i order allergen rated high filtration filters, my old furnace just overheats and shuts off due to air flow restriction. These seem good so far.Sizing:The biggest complaint I saw from others on these filters is that they're not a literal size. Meaning a 16x20x1 filter isn't LITERALLY 16 inches x 20 inches x 1 inch.I replaced a 16x20x1 from another brand with this. It was the same size as the other 6 companies I bought from. They're all the same (correct) size. Granted I haven't ordered every size this company makes, but what I ordered was the size that I expected, and the same size you'd get from every other brand.Basically, the people complaining that they're not the right size probably have no idea what size their furnace needs. Look at the older filter label, order that size. Job done.I am a medical facility operations advisor filters that are not stamped with a ""A"" rating like MERV 13A or MERV 9A will loose the rating quickly so a MERV 13 might become a MERV 11 after 30 days.With large air handlers you have ""pre, intermediate, final, and last stop HEPA"" those HEPAs get those tiny buggers like TB.So with standard home filters best to change every 30 days so you don't plug up ypur evaporator.Or if you can get into your air handler unit (AHU) wash your evaporator every year like your condenser outside.Hope not too deep I really could have gone alot deeper.My daughter is allergic to so many airborne things, including cat dander (we have four). Since switching to these filters (instead of the 3M allergen ones we'd been using) she hasn't had to use an inhaler! Yes, she takes a daily dose of Zyrtec, but she started doing that long before we switched filters and still needed daily puffs. Besides eliminating my daughter's need for an inhaler, I *know* these filters work better just by looking at them because they catch SO MUCH MORE junk. There were times when we went three months without changing a 3M filter, and even then, they didn't have as much junk on them as one of these Aerostar filters catches in one month. Seriously, give these filters a try! You have nothing to lose because they're a lot less expensive. The only downsides are: a) You will have to change these more frequently because they work SO much better. b) For some reason, they aren't sized exactly as labeled--about 1/4 inch shorter both width and lengthwise. However, they're still less expensive than other brands that don't work as well, even if you use one a month, and the size issue isn't really an issue unless you sleep right next to your furnace (because there might be a slight noise when your air starts and stops since these run small). Our furnace is in the basement, so we never hear it.Terrific product, especially when compared to what's available at the big box stores. The only negative I've seen is that I have to change them more frequently.I live in Colorado, and we've been having more forest fires lately. In the past, fires have been noticeable indoors by the smell. With these filters, I don't notice that smell, and I hope that means I'm getting less junk in my lungs.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Enjoy the great taste of Dunkin' in Dymatize ISO100 protein powder with our two new flavors � Dunkin' Cappuccino and Mocha Latte flavors. 20 servings of Dymatize ISO100 in Dunkin' Cappuccino flavor Protein Powder, with 95mg of caffeine per scoop. 25 grams of protein which includes 5.5 grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), 2.6 grams of Leucine per serving, 1 gram or less of sugar and fat per serving. Scientifically formulated with fast-absorbing hydrolyzed whey protein isolate, ISO100 can help support your keto diet, low carb diet or high protein diet; add to your favorite recipe or high protein shakes. Gluten free with less than 1g of Lactose; sweeteners like sucralose, steviol glycosides are presentDymatize ISO100 has hands down become my go-to protein powder. I have now tried 9 flavors, they are (in no particular order):- Chocolate Caramel- Chocolate Peanut Butter- Cinnamon Bun- Cocoa Pebbles- Cookie and Cream- Fudge Brownie- Gourmet Chocolate- Gourmet Vanilla- StrawberryThere are really four main factors that matter to me in a protein powder; How well does it mix, What's actually in it, how much does it cost, and the most important factor of all, taste.1) How well does it mix:It mixes great, zero complaints on this front. It borderline mixes too well. I typically have my protein in one of two ways; a shaker bottle with a metal shaker, mixed with water or milk, or a protein shake/smoothie mixed in a ninja blender. In both situations, I have zero issues with the mix. Never comes out clumpy or lumpy. Some of the flavors mix so well they come out very foamy (more so than other powders) and I actually have to wait a bit so I'm not just drinking bubbles.2) What's in it?:I am not a supplement expert, but Dymatize's ISO100 has significantly less cholesterol than a lot of competitors, and that's good enough for me. This factor matters the least to me, I don't look too much into ingredient labels, but heart disease does run in my family, so avoiding unnecessary cholesterol, which is common in a lot of powders, is a big plus.3) Cost:I think the price is exceptional for the product. Sometimes there will be great deals here on Amazon for specific flavors. I will get to it in the next section, but even though I do not think Dymatize has the hands-down best flavors, for the cost I couldn't be happier.4) Taste:THE BIG ONE!!! Gourmet Chocolate is without question my absolute favorite chocolate flavored protein powder. Totally subjective obviously, but I don't think anything else even really comes close, and I've tried a pretty extensive selection of chocolates. For a reference point that a lot of people can relate to, I do not like Optimum Nutrition's chocolate at all, I think it's pretty disgusting.I am giving an overall rating of 4 stars because aside from gourmet chocolate and cookies and cream, I do not think any of the other flavors I've tried are out of this world. Look above for the list of all the chocolate variants I've had. I won't bother buying any of them again, because the gourmet chocolate is just plain better than all of the others. The flavor difference is minimal enough that I don't care for them to add variety, but big enough that I see no reason to waiver from the king.Chocoloate Peanut Butter is an outlier on the chocolates, It's really good too, BUT when I want a chocolate peanut butter flavor, I think it tastes way better to just use gourmet chocolate, and then add a tablespoon or two of peanut butter powder, like PB Fit. It's a small amount more calories for a lot more protein and a much less artificial flavor.Cookies and Cream is my second favorite. It's also super delicious. Now that I've experimented with most of the flavors, I will probably just be buying cookies and cream and gourmet chocolate, so that I don't get bored of one.Gourmet vanilla and cinnamon bun are fine. If you really like those flavors I have no complaints.Strawberry I could not get to taste good in a smoothie. Just wouldn't sit right with me. Mixed with just almond milk it's pretty yummy though. I got pretty tired of this flavor pretty fast and will likely not buy it again. I'm generally not crazy about fruit flavored protein powders though.So, I didn't give 5 stars because not every flavor is my favorite. What is you might ask? I really love Ghost Protein. I think they have the best flavors if you want 3 or more choices. Their coffee flavor is my favorite protein of all time. BUT, Ghost is a lot more expensive. The ISO100 makes me a lot happier when I remember I'm spending quite a bit less per scoop (I usually buy the 3 lb tubs of ISO100, which is obviously cheaper per oz). It just comes down to price to performance, and right now ISO100 wins it for me. I still buy Ghost from time to time because I like it so much.Just for funsies here is my fairly generic protein smoothie I have almost every morning for my breakfast.1 scoop of either Gourmet Chocolate -or- Cookies and Cream ISO100.3/4 cup milk2 tablespoons peanut butter powder (I like PB Fit)1 whole frozen banana1/4-1/2 cup frozen black coffee ice cubes (you can of course just use regular ice cubes)About 35-40g of protein for a 350-400 calorie smoothie that tastes BANGIN.If you try it out, blend the milk, PB powder, and protein together first. Then add the coffee ice cubes and blend for 30 seconds to a minute. Then add the banana and blend to desired thickness, another 30 seconds - 1 minute. If you try to do it all at once, there are too many cold ingredients and the protein and PB powder won't blend as well as it normally would otherwise.OBLIGATORY FINAL SENTENCE IN ALL CAPS ABOUT GETTING THEM GAINZZZ.I have been a huge fan of dymatize for years since i started my fitness journey. I am so happy that they have expanded and created more flavors so that customers can have a variety. The first flavor i ever tired was chocolate and it was so good not as chalky and there was no weird after taste. I love how they both taste great with either water or almond milk.This is a review as well with a comparison of all the flavors i have tasted thus far.Chocolate-taste like chocolate milkCinnamon bun- taste like the cinnamon toast crunch cereal milk or if youve ever tasted horchata(cinnamon rice water)Birthday cake- i read a review that said it tasted like halo top birthday cake, spot on! Reminds me of sweet cream ice cream from marble slab but Not too sweet!Peanut butter chocolate- my new favorite! Taste JUST like the little debby nutty bars.I have tried over 6 vanilla protein powders and I have truly hated them all. Everyone says chocolate powders are so much better, but I hate chocolate. A friend told me about this brand and the birthday cake flavor and I had to try it. My mind was blown. It legit tastes like the halo top birthday cake ice cream! With less than 1g of sugar and 25g of protein. I love it! I WILL be buying more! I'm addicted! :)So before my purchase, i read the reviews from 5 stars to 1 stars and viewed the images posted. I became hesitant to purchase but i had previously bought the cinnamon bun flavor at a vitaminshop and i was very satisfied. I decided to go with my gut feeling and purchase this flavor for i heard many great reviews and LET ME TELL YOU! It smells DELICIOUS. .Now i posted the tub to show everyone how this might look like a rip off because it looks half empty BUT I WEIGHED IT and it's exactly what you're buying!!! The window strip for visibility is there for helpful tricks not to show the buyers it's supposed to be completely full...i weighed the product and it does give me the 725g of protein it states, my scale indicates 880g only because it's considering the weoght of the tub as well. It even says on the product ""sold by weight not by volume""IM VERY PLEASED! THANKS.Tastes ok, but the tamper seal on the top was falling off as if it had dried out. The plastic seal on the lid seemed in better shape though.The biggest issue is, for something that is advertised as gluten free.... I seem to have been glutened the 2 times I've used it.Pro's:","Pro's: 
-Tastes good
-Mixes well

Text: Laminated Particleboard. Features 2 open storage spaces divided by 1 adjustable shelf that can support up to 15 lb. Cut out hole in the Back panel which allows for easy wire management. Features 1 practical drawer. Made in North American with non-toxic laminated particleboard. Accessories not included, 5-year Quality guarantee.Back is not laminated and the accessories are not includedJust built the desk tonight. Really not that hard to put together, although I am very handy. Only problem is that I didn't realize until half way through that the top of the desk had a surface crack across one side. I decided to finish it and see if I can get a replacement from the manufacturer. I will update with results. Really not a bad desk for the price. The design is great, but the material is cheap. It's pressed wood with a very thin veneer. I've had items made of similar material and I know they don't last. But, for the price it's ok. If they send me a replacement top I'll be happy. ASSEMBLY TIP: lay out the pieces like they show in step 1 and it's much easier to put together.UPDATE:Emailed South Shore customer service this morning. Here is the customer service email: South Shore Service <services@southshore.ca> This afternoon received a response that they are sending me a new desktop. They're also sending me the studs to connect to the base. Very happy with service. Great company with fast response to service requests.2nd update 8-16-16:Installed new desktop. Very easy to replace. Arrived in perfect condition, packed very well with wood all around it.Awesome. Its very hard to find an affordable computer desk that isnt just a flat table these days. Package is pretty heavy, and if you live on a 2nd floor appt like me, you may need a hand to get it up the steps. Came on time, completely undamaged. Not even a scratch. I was worried based on some other reviews I read, but I guess I was lucky. The instructions are just pictures, but if you simply read them over once before starting assembly, and seperate pieces and parts accordingly, Its actually really easy. All my parts were labeled correctly, just double check everything step by step as you go, as some of the letters and numbers do look similar. You can do it yourself, but I'd highly suggest a second set of hands to help with holding piece in place as you attach them to one another in the first few steps. Funny enough, they even state to grab a friend, and put on music before beginning assembly haha. If you have a basic sense of 3D ""front and back, left and right"", and a screwdriver you are set. I would NOT suggest using a drill, as the connectors are designed to be inserted, and locked into place by location, not strength necessarily. All the holes were pre-drilled and lined up perfectly, and the kit came with exactly the parts, and color specified. If you dont double check the details in the instruction pictures, its easy to flip some parts around as they are not labeled front and back, as well as sizes of specific connector materials as they are the same type and color, with different diameters. So make sure you get it right the first time, as its a pain to attempt to re-do. [I had to re-do a piece of the top shelf, and it was tough to do w/o breaking the connector.] Took me and my roomate less than an hour to assemble. My half tower fits perfectly in the base, BUT without the open shelf. I had to remove it. I have the drawer above, then tower immediately below. A full tower would NOT fit, and a mini tower, or laptop would be fine. There are spaces built into the back of the desk for wiring which is really nice, and helps with airflow and cooling. The height is also very nice, as long as you have an adjustable computer chair. Its fits both of my 21in monitors on the top shelf beautifully, with the roll out keyboard shelf being a life saver. [only 1 monitor in pic, Im repairing the other currently.] Computer speakers get a little boost if placed between the main top piece of the desk, and shelving piece. If you need something affordable and functional, go for it. It can support at least 130 lbs of weight when assembled, as I have stood on it multiple times already to get to the ceiling above, and wall behind for decorating, so no worries of flimsyness or collapsing.The box had seen better days when it arrived, but everything inside was perfect. (one or two little chips doesn't bother me) I thought it was going to be a chore to put this together alone, but it only took me 2 hours! Very simple instructions, a screwdriver and hammer are only tools needed. It's perfect for my needs and I love it.I bought this desk in black for my son's room; he is 11 (5 ft 7 - 132 lbs).He fits this desk, even though it is considered smaller.He loves it because he feels special to have his own work area in his room.I assembled it myself (I am his mom) without any difficulty.It says you need 2 people to assemble, but you do not.Directions: you kind of have to guide your way through these assembly instructions because they are not completely accurate. Just use your head and you'll be alright.It took me almost 2 hours to assemble-but my son is worth the time.The parts are all labeled with ""A"" ""B"" G"" etc�.The back panel was too small for desk, (wrong part) but I can do without it since it's against a wall.PERFECT for dorms, small spaces etc..The drawer and keyboard tray slide without effort and has a great, smooth glide.You won't be disappointed.Have a great day!shorter than i thought it would be but it definitely works. glad i didn't buy the chair yet so i know what to look for now.all but one of the rails came bent and amazon refunded me for keeping a damaged product but they would have helped me get new rails if i hadn't needed the desk right away. they straightened out enough to be functional when i screwed them down tight.easy enough to put together alone. i did it in about an hour. getting it out of the packaging is kinda tough and i had help but if you give it some grit you can do it.the drawer isn't white on the inside so that threw me off but it all looks good and isn't obnoxious. picture included just so it doesn't catch anyone else offguard. also the middle piece shown on the hutch portion doesn't quite touch the top of the desk. i would have secured that with a cam lock if i could have. all the pieces are covered in sawdust as pictured, so i recommend wiping it all down after putting it together. that shouldn't prevent you from buying it.overall a really great desk for the price and quite attractive for pressboard. thought about docking a star for the minor issues but honestly i'm very happy with this desk. i wanted something cheap and functional and this is exactly that.Pro's:","Pro's:

UPGRADE FOR ALL 8 HYBRIDS: Midsize Majek Mens K5s Design High Traction Tech Grips-Excellent clubs! Do not be fooled by the fact that these are senior flex clubs. They play closer to a regular flex. I am in my early 50�s and am super happy with them. If you struggle to hit long and midrange irons like I do, then these are the clubs for you. To be a good iron player you have to strike down on the ball and �punch� it. That is a difficult swing to master and requires a lot of clubhead speed. These hybrid irons allow you to use a sweeping swing (striking the ball upward) and still get great iron results. These clubs instantly improved my game by several strokes. If your swing mechanics are solid, then these clubs are far more accurate and forgiving than conventional irons. The graphite shafts give you good distance without having to generate high clubhead speeds.I can't believe these hybrids, wow!! My handicap was 23, using irons and about ready to give up golf. I had a back operation 6 months ago and just couldn't hit the irons correctly. Received my hybrids Saturday searched the internet on how to hit them, not much information on how to hit 6,7,8 and 9 hybrids, so I didn't expect much and first time going to the course playing 18 holes, shot a score of 82. Unbelievable, the lowest score ever. So excited to be playing again.In my late 60s, decided to get serious about golf again. These are flat out the best, most forgiving and easiest ""irons"" to hit. As long as you set up right, keep your head down, and swing through, the ball goes straight, every time! Most remarkable clubs I've ever used. Just as easy to hit the 3 or 4 iron as the 8 or 9. Why older duffers like myself still struggle with blades, even cavity backed, is beyond me. And the price is hard to beat. Nuff said.I purchased these clubs to replace my old MacGregor VIP Oversize Plus irons with S-Flex tapered steel shafts. The MacGregors are still excellent clubs, but my 73 year old body can't use them effectively any more. I purchased these Majek hybrid clubs in the hopes that they would work well and give my body some relief. I have not been disappointed. The grips are easy to grasp and hold, the senior flex graphite shafts are a relief to my arms, and the hybrid heads great for making a good golf shot.Haven't been able to hit a decent iron shot in years. Shanks, tops, skulls, pushes, pulls, etc - but nothing near the flag. I had zero confidence with any iron shot from 30 yards to 150. Finally decided to try a full set of hybrids, since I could generally hit my 4 and 5 hybrids well. These exceeded my expectations! I can hit my approach shots high and straight. Still learning to chip with hybrids and dial in the distances, but I'm sure that will come. I now hit shots to the green with confidence that I haven't felt in a long time. Based upon my first few rounds, my scores have dropped by about 5 strokes/18 holes. I think it will even get better as I gain experience with these hybrids.Pro's:","Pro's:

Plenty of room for two queen sized blow up mattresses but we used the front room for storage and seating. Loved that the front room had a cover so that the front room was not exposed to the elements. Very well insulated and easy to setup, despite the instructions being very minimal. Quality of our tent was on par with more popular brands like coleman and core. I could not put up the canopy but i think this was user error.I was absolutely impressed with the qaulity of this tent. The gage in the materteral is much thicker and the zippers are made out of crime plated steel. The water proof bottom is of a higher thickness and much better qaulity than every other tent in this price range. And Ive had a lot of tents. Its very easy to heat and wind doesn't come through it! A great deal ! Im not payed for saying this or am I in anyway involved in this company! You won't find a better tent for this price!We haven�t used this in bad weather yet, but in nice weather it was perfect and has SO much room.

I got the white ones and I�m obsessed. Did not come with any damage or warping of the plexiglass. Also someone mentioned that the plexiglass was foggy. There is a sticker that said peel off protective film before use. Thankfully they had that sticker because at first I was bummed it looked foggy. Once I peeled off the film it looked crystal clear. Only thing is one frame in my two pack had film on both sides and the other frame only had film on one side. I sat there flicking the edge for a minute before I realized. Just know there may be film on one or both sides of glass. Highly recommend for the price. Frames are expensive as hell so I�m glad I found these.We used the frames for two posters in our nursery. The posters were not cheap and we had them custom matted, so we wanted a nicer look to the frames as well. These were perfect because they�re not too heavy weight, but still look like nice quality and not cheap looking. I personally like that it�s not glass, since it�s in a nursery and I don�t want to risk glass breaking. Overall, for the size of the frame, it�s a good deal for the items.This is a real quality frame. I purchased it in the weathered white & I love it. Put a beach themed puzzle in it & hung on my bedroom wall. It looks great! The puzzle was a tight fit for thickness, but it did work. I�m glad I bought it.Great frames! Mine came packaged nicely with protective foam on the corners and a plastic film on the front of both Poster frames.. The black has hooks that twist to lock down the frame's back, which I find way easier than the metal that you have to bend to lock in. The wood is study and is a nice washed out white-tan color. Overall I'm happy with the purchase! Doesn't look or feel like cheap frame material, so I think it's worth the price.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Made of solid hardwood, heavy-duty stools with 29 inches in height. Heavy-duty seat and legs with 6 stretchers for support. Overall size measures at 18 inches width, 16 inches depth and 29 inches in height, the seat measures 9 inches in depth, 17.63 in width and 1.63 in height, the leg measures at 1.5 inches depth by 1.5 inches width. Includes set of 2 antique black finish stools. Assembly required, easy and fast installationOk, so when we opened the boxes, we were missing 2 sets of bars ( the medium and the long) collectively, from both boxes. We took the bars from both boxes to make one stool. I REALLY like this stool!!! No, it's not all that comfortable ( it IS wood ya know), but what sold me: it seems sturdy. it is heavy, but sturdy is VERY important here. We have autistic children that WIPED OUT our last purchase of bar stools with in 9 months. It is great because it is sturdy and, with no back and no arms.....my kids don't seem as interested in them, which means they might actually last around here!!!! ( a mom can dream!)Now.... the customer service portion. Once I realized we were missing parts, I came back to amazon to contact the seller. It was only 12 hours and I had a response ( I emailed late in the afternoon) and to my complete pleasure, they apologized and said they would put the missing bars in the mail asap. Now, that's a nice change these days and I give an overall rating of 5 stars because of both aspects of this review. I will do an update IF autism whips these stools into firewood, but here is hoping the stools last!!I purchased these to really bring together the bar top and dining room area in my house when I was putting it on the market. If I�d had the room when I moved across the country to bring them with me, I would definitely have kept them.These are sturdy, solid wood, and wonderfully made. The saddleback style is a lot more comfortable for an adult backside than those round things that you see everywhere. I did get several months of use out of them before I had to sell everything I owned except my clothes and books, and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a gorgeous set of barstools that are also comfortable.I purchased these with my own money and did not receive any compensation whatsoever for this review.I have to be honest I really like the look of these and I can tell that it�s going to be a sturdy stool. However, we can�t get some of the pieces to fit together quite right which is terribly disappointing. We�re currently using it as a speaker stand instead of something to sit on. But I�m not giving up. I going to try strapping it around the legs to hold it in while assembling the last 2 rungs.The stools themselves are great, exactly as described, sturdy, not difficult to assemble- HOWEVER- the stickers on these stools are unacceptable. There is absolutely no reason that we should have to deal with nasty sticker residue on an item of this value and quality. I would have given these stools a 5-star review, if not for the nasty sticky spot that is still on the seat portion of all 4 of my brand new stools, after trying multiple ways to clean it off without damaging the stool. Stickers on each leg have an identifying letter for assembly, they are small stickers, but it still took too much effort to remove these, while the sticker on the actually seat is infuriating.I needed something for under the counter ledge to sit on that didn�t take up a big footprint as the area is kind of tight there. They fit the bill for that and have held up okay. They seem a bit wobbly after several months of use though. We don�t even use them that much. They still look nice and we like them okay. We will probably replace, but they work for now.Pro's:","Pro's:

COOLING EVERYWHERE YOU NEED IT: Customize the direction of airflow to where you need it most with 8-way cooling using two 4-way directional vents.I received my unit today, it's not that noisey and it blow strong airSo far i love AC. It cools down my one bedroom apartment pretty nicely.I don't know what other people's experience along this line might be or might have been. I have no problem with the a/c. It appears to be fine. HOWEVER. I wanted to register my unit. The manual that came with the unit had a web address where a customer could go to register online. I went to the page listed and there was a page of boxes to fill in. The first box was for ""Model #"". All that came up in the drop down menu were tvs. The tv listing would scroll down and when I got to the last tv listing...it would automatically be entered in this field. I tried many times with the same result. I finally contacted TCL through chat. Their first response was that I was probably accessing the page from the ""wrong URL"". Even though I was accessing it from the URL listed in the TCL manual. Went around a bit with them on this one and their second reply was that I needed to ""clear my browser"". Which I did. (Knowing full well that this was NOT going to solve this issue.) Actually I cleared it twice. Meaning that each time I had to re-enter any data for any groups or websites or pages that I had to post a password for. It was NOT the browser. Same problem. Could NOT enter the data in the field. Told them they needed to correct it on their end. They, then, sent me the page and I entered all the info in the boxes and sent it back to them. Was contacted and told they had not received my response. I sent this info to them 4 TIMES. And they still did not receive it. Can you see why I might be a bit irritated? I am not going to deal with these people any further. I will say to you if you are a potential customer: maybe start out by calling them? Or do not depend on them to EVER be there if you need them. Have a problem with your unit? GOOD LUCK!As said in the title, I desperately needed something to cool down the sunroom in the back part of the house. It was basically unusable in the summer.To give you an idea, it would hit 90F in the room by mid morning in the summer if it was a warm day. This is with thick insulating curtains, blinds, and double pained windows. Absolutely miserable to use unless you wanted a sauna.This struggles a little on the hottest days (100+) to keep the temps below 80f, but that's mostly my fault for getting a size that's a bit too small for a big room with high ceilings. But 80 feels frosty compared to the 98+ degrees it would get to without it.Now this unit is a bit noisy if you turn up the fan speed to high. I keep it on low most of the time though and it does just fine. If you're a light sleeper you might look elsewhere.I haven't measure the power draw myself, but it's barely made a scratch in the power bill in the last few months I've used it.Really the only complaint I would have with the unit itself is the rather flimsy cheap remote that comes with it. Sometimes the buttons don't register and you just have to keep aiming it in different directions until you hear it beep. Not to mention the cheaply applied fonts that have rubbed off from light use. Do better on this part, TCL.Was surprised they shipped it via UPS from Oregon to Florida - probably not very cost-effective. When I installed it, the left rear corner was badly bent - probably a shipping issue, but the box didn't look very damaged, just a little wear and tear. I was a little dismayed to find it identical to my prior A/C, a Black and Decker model which gave me LOTS of problems (failed in a continuous duty state - had to use a power line thermostat to keep it going - and then the motor froze). The B&D remote even works on the TCL model. But the TCL A/C is working fine so far, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Cooling is great, unit is a little noisy, installation was a breeze since the unit was the exact same size as prior unit. Except I had to fix the bent up corner or enlarge the hole.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 100% Polyester. Stylish and unique set of curtain panels with a blue Jacobean floral design throughout.. Room darkening window curtains filter a portion of light and heat, but allow for some natural light to come through.. These curtains measure 108�H x 52�W with a 2� header and will add a dreamy touch for your bedroom, living room or dining room.. 100% polyester window panels with a floral design. Curtains are not lined and have a 3� rod pocket for easy installation.. Easy to care for and safe to machine wash cold in a mesh laundry bag, gentle cycle and tumble dry low.Excellent value. Doesn�t block out the light as fully as hoped, but still a 5 Star value. Order 2 sets for wider windows. Use clips if you want to maximize length for puddling at the bottom. Clip a cheap flat white sheet to the back if you prefer full light blocking.I didn't buy these for the light blocking properties, but for the look. They�re AMAZING quality for the price. I�d buy again in a heartbeat!I love them. When I saw them I knew I had to have them. If you knew me you would be shocked because they are not me, but I designed my room around them using the blue on the walls and my room is now my relaxing space. Not the best photos...sorry. Thanks!We just got a new (to us) home...painted our dining room navy blue with white wainscoting. Looks really nice and crisp and bold. Finding the perfect curtains was so hard!!! These are exactly what I was looking for! Super great quality, thick, not cheap fabric. (After taking the pictures, I ordered a 3rd set so my big window had 4 panels-looks better) I love them!!!I was so excited to get these curtains today. I only ordered about 3 or 4 days ago and they arrived today. They were shipped on hangers in such a way that they didn't have one wrinkle. They are so soft, and rich feeling it is amazing. These are so much nicer than I expected. (I had hoped they were this nice but still unsure.) If I didn't know better, I would have expected to have had to order these custom made for my windows. I didn't hesitate to order these because I have always been happy with the customer service I have received in the past. These lovely curtains will give me many years of beauty to my home.Pro's:","Pro's:

Machine washable in cold water, use only non-chlorine bleach when needed, tumble dry low and cool iron on face side as neededI ordered both to see the difference in color and which would match my bedroom best! I thought it would be helpful for you to compare as well if ur interested and not sure which color to go with. I�m going for ivory which is the lighter color ??Bought several sets of these for new house! Love the linen look! Nice backing. Thick material. I did iron to get wrinkles out of!These curtains were everything I was hoping for. They are completely black out but somehow manage to feel somewhat light in weight. I love the fact that they are a true neutral color and not golden or yellowish or ivory in nature. Natural color is a good description for them and they blend very well with our beige walls.. Our walls are painted with Sherman Williams balanced beige and they look great together. It did take a while to iron them and I will need to touch them up after a few days again but it was very doable and I can tell that they will in the end be well ironed in appearance. Overall I�m extremely satisfied with these curtains. The picture is spot on color wise. Just a great find!I was not at all sure that these curtains would suit me as I attempted to give a facelift to a tiny screened porch we never used, but I opted for them because the price seemed very reasonable, there were good length options, and they appeared to be the only ones that had kind of a linen-esque ""weave"" to them (which matched my furniture cushions better than smooth curtains would have. When they arrived, I still really wasn't totally sure, but I put them up ... they instantly added SO much to the look of the new ""room"" and I liked them SO much that I ordered another 2 sets, and then another 2 (for spots on the porch I had thought ""didn't absolutely need curtains"" initially). I felt with their nice vertical height (redundant?) they really grounded everything in the room and made some relatively inexpensive furniture look really nice and much higher end than it actually was. The fact that they are also able to block sunlight (if you needed that--mine are kept pulled in, so I don't use that feature) is an added bonus, as is their ability to handle damp and even sometimes wet conditions. They seem very robust and the weave is nice ... it's navy but just faintly flecked with black (or something darker than navy) when you really look up close, which ends up meaning they mix with other navy elements very well (i.e., the navy in my cushions is not precisely the same as the navy of the curtains, but with the black flecking in the curtains, they blend really well, even right up against each other). I know I was unsure to begin with, but I am now a true believer--especially for the price, I just don't think you can go wrong with these if your use case is anything like mine was!After trying 3 other pairs of curtains in two months, I finally found the right fit!I recently moved into a new place next to a busy NYC park, visible from my large east facing bedroom windows. In the mornings, direct sunlight would wake me up and keep me up before I was ready for the day, the light in the room felt overwhelming. I needed a curtain that would dampen sound and keep in the room�s conditioned temperature stable while blocking light and hopefully keeping with the room�s light color scheme.These curtains keep the room feeling open (even when they are drawn closed) with their ivory color and nice texture, but let absolutely NO light in, aside from what peeks through the tops of the curtains which can�t be helped. The color is a beautiful off-white that really keeps the room feeling open after trying other darker pairs that were not a fit.I am so glad to have found a curtain that looks light and airy, but works hard to decrease noise, temperature and light exchange.Pro's:","Pro's:

We chose the one for our unit (Frigidaire) rather than a generic sleeve. Perfect fit.Now, some people are complaining that there is no water dripping out the back. That is because newer A/Cs use the water that would normally drip, to cool the fins and the condenser. The fan in the back splashes the water around to the parts needed cooling. (I suppose if the condensation gets too much the water will drip out of the cut outs in the back.)Its too soon to rate energy efficiency so no comments about that.I am so happy with this unit. It is so quiet and powerful. Remote controlled.. It was easy to install into the wall. Comes with everything you need. I already had a sleeve so I just used mine.We did not know it needed a sleeve.Low noise level and remote easy to useHave installed in an old sleeve. It perfectly fit there.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 4 Mode Options: Air Conditioner, Fan, Dehumidifier, and Heater with built-in continuous drain design and effective cooling for spaces up to 300 square feet. Washable dust filters trap dirt and debris, improving indoor air quality and unit life span.. Programable Convenience: Three fan speeds help control temperature and energy costs. Intelligent functions like Sleep Mode, and automatic on/off with programable 24-hour timer, offer utility and ease of use.. Compact Mobile Design: Designed to save space and fit easily in any room. This unit is perfect for single-room cooling/heating, and the included caster wheels allow for quick, effortless transport.. Practical Controls: Dual LED digital touch display panels and full-function remote control makes this 12,000 BTU portable unit simple to program and use.. Self-Evaporating System: There is less need to empty water trays thanks to innovative evaporative technology that draws moisture out of your space to evaporate in the outside air.I have purchased several different brands of portable air conditioners; Pinguino & Sylvane . This is almost ideal. Only requires a single vent out the window (I've had dual hose). It is much smaller in size which means it takes up less space, so when entering the room it isn't the first thing you see. I love that it is fully self evaporating; which means no inconvenient water tube to be emptied into a bucket every how many hours. It cools my bedroom which is approximately 12x15- temp in NYC of late about 90F hot and humid. No sticky humidity in my room either. Noise level, on par with other portables. Doesn't stop my hubby from watching tv and falling asleep with the remote in his hand- same ole, same ole. lol Bottom line- I like it and so far, it's great!nanLove the fact that this product is portable and works without actually having to put it through the window! There are accessories that come with it to do so, however. There is really nothing to dislike about this unit. Yes, it's a little noisy, but it's an Air Conditioner, at 8,000 BTU! For the price I paid, I can't expect anything better. Thank you Rosewill for making a great unit. This company never lets me down.This unit is pretty good for the price. It cools an average size bedroom pretty well.I live in Florida and rent a room. I like to keep the temperature around 75 degreesand my roommate who also owns the house that I live in likes the house warmer.My room is in the front of the home and a window-mounted unit is forbidden by the HOAso I use this unit and it works pretty well. When I purchased this unit, there was a reviewthat stated this unit leaked and the person lived in the desert. So I measured the unit purchasedthe pictured Sterilite container pictured in the attachment. This unit fits in there perfectly I purchased the unit in February of 2019and I watched inside of the container for water leaking. About a month went by and there was NO water leaking.Then about a month after that, I looked in the bucket and notice a small amount (about a quarter-inch) of water was in the bucket. That water evaporated in less than a week. Then last night 08/10/2019, the unit would not start. The display on the top had a little re3d light on it indicating that the internal tub was full. I picked up the unit, put it on my bed, (I read that the plug I needed to unscrew was at the bottom of the unit) I unscrewed the plug, tipped the unit over slightly and emptied the internal tank (which was full of water)r into this container, took the container that had like an inch and a half of water in it to the tub and emptied it. I screwed the plug back I put everything backed and it started up without any trouble. I hope this helps someone. Oh, this DB meter app on my phone says this unit puts out audio averaging 51 DB-A whatever that is. I have earbuds in all the time so I do not notice it.I love this portable ac so much that I�m actually considering buying a second one to replace an older portable ac in another room! It takes up less room, and seems to use less power. I live in a 1,000 sq. ft. place, and space is definitely a concern. The room I am using it in is roughly 250 sq. ft. It�s more effective than other portable ac�s I have had in the past. I love that it�s self-evaporating. I live in a drier climate, but other ac�s I�ve had did need to be drained frequently. So far, no issues with that with this model. Quieter than older models, but I wouldn�t call it silent. That�s okay, because the white noise helps me sleep! I love having a remote control for it as well. I have older windows in my house, similar to what another reviewer had posted. It took a little work to cut down the window insert to size, but it�s my fault for not measuring my windows first. It also took some work to get the exhaust hose to latch. But, not impossible. Overall, definitely worth the money. Especially since it�s at a lower price than most other portable ac�s on the market.Pro's:","Pro's:

Durable and easy to clean synthetic leather shell with full wrap around hook and loop closure and attached thumb for safety. Get in shape one punch at a time with the comprehensive protection offered by these boxing MMA Muay Thai training workout gloves. A mesh palm to keep the hands cool and comfortable as you train to reach your fitness goals. These sparring punching bag mitts come in a variety of colors and are sure to give you a competitive high calorie burning workoutI've used a whole bunch of different training gloves. These are my favorites. Incredibly durable. About a year and a half of hard use from a big guy: I hit hard; I sweat a lot; I don't take particularly good care of my equipment. The only things I've noticed are a small hole in the internal fabric by my right middle finger tip and some obvious wear on the cosmetic design.No, these aren't fight gloves. They're for training. Heavy bag, light sparring - they're perfect. I've seen some comments that these may not be a full 16 oz. I'm not sure about that. If so, I feel bad for sparring with these. Otherwise, they are awesome gloves. The foam padding over the fist is more than adequate to absorb a great deal of impact but still communicate the feel of a punch snapping vs pushing, landing vs glancing, etc. They're not so big that you can cover your whole face with one like some other of those big pillowy gloves. The wrist support is pretty solid when snugged down tight. EASY on and off, unlike all of these wacky X-closures and overlapping straps that you need an engineering degree to take off.Great, great gloves. I'll buy another pair if these ever give out (maybe not in ostentatious gold, though)They feel great, they look amazing, the value is excellent.Amazing buy, exactly like the photos. Buy itthese are the best sparring gloves. quality is great & they're extremely comfortable!I absolutely LOVE these gloves, I have been training and competing in Muay Thai for over 4 years and I can say that these gloves are absolutely amazing for things such as sparring, hitting the heavy bag or even amateur competitions... however if you are going to compete at a higher level I would definitely recommend gloves by higher brands such as Fairtex or Yokkao... overall gloves are perfect and they do the job, got these a little over 2 years ago and I still break them out from time to time, and they still work just fine with minimal wear and tear... great bang for the buck overall and the gold/black color combo looks awesome as well...Pro's:","Pro's:

I did, so I bought this and it is perfect for displaying the picture. Good purchaseso easy to hang canvas art�I had two 24x45 posters printed, and I couldn't find any picture frames without paying a small fortune, but this was an excellent alternative to a full frame. The magnets are strong enough to hold my rather large posters (and it is thicker material too). The string for hanging is staying strong. I definitely recommend this.The frame is very beautiful and easy to put together. I had to handle the picture and frame gently so it would not fall apart. The diamond kit is 30x40 cm, which is not that big, but it is heavy enough that it is easily separated. I trimmed the edges of the picture, which helped considerably. I would buy it again!I have tried numerous times to put the picture in here, must be something wrong with my computer.This item appears to be well made but don't put it in a room with breeze. I have mine hung on my office wall. I have my window open and whenever there is a mild breeze coming through, the magnets fail.

Proudly Custom Made to Order in the USA!It's okay - the construction is bevelled wooden frame with framing staples and about the quality you'd expect for this price. It looks nice on the wall and frames pictures decently. I got the rose gold finish which is a nice mild rose-gold type colour with metallic sheen (somewhat like brushed metal. It's shiny, but not mirror reflective). If you look up close the joints between wood arms has gaps, but probably wouldn't distract for most types of art.Regarding the foam board backing however - I tested with a Lineco pH testing pen and the board contains acidic content. While the interior foam of the board seems to be okay, the papered surface artwork actually sits on is fairly acidic. It's also thick enough that adding a matte if desired is possible, but would require squishing of the board backingNeeded an 18""X18"" frame for my son's artwork. This was perfect. Easy to use.

This was to replace a chain that broke. I wrongly thought that my old chain was 0.5mm. This 0.5mm chain is very very thin - the seller's website warns that it is thin so please believe them! On comparing this new chain with my old one, I think my old one was more like 0.9 or 1mm. I've worn the new 0.5mm chain once - it is almost impossible to see it against my skin! I was planning to use it with some (not very big or heavy) pendants, but am concerned the chain may break and I lose the pendant. I might wear the chain on its own for a few times and see how it holds up. So, this is not the seller's fault, please be aware of the size you are buying! P.S. The gift box it came in is lovely, the item arrived a few days early, and the outer packaging was very secure.I bought this for a pendant, but, having no idea of mm, thought it would be small enough to wear with it. Nope, too big, however, it did fit another that I use it with and it looks perfect with it. All in all, everything worked out well except that I still have to get another chain for the one I didn't have a chain for in the first place.Excellent gold chain arrived on time as describedIt's very fine.

Text: Weather Resistant Fabric. Rust Resistant powder coated frame. Decorative windows. Power source type: ManualThe directions are easy to follow. Material is sturdy.For the price I can't really complain. Our son got married at our house in December and we needed some sort of cover from the weather. We bought 4 tents. I really like that we were able to leave some of the sides open and not put up all four walls. It made it easy to do food in one tent and tables in the others. The poles aren't that sturdy, but they worked just fine for our occasion. I will say, the tents do look nice set up. Once we got one tent set up, the others were extremely easy and went up fast. I would suggest buying a large duffle bag to store it in once you are done to keep everything together. I found some from another seller. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the poles were heavier! As to waterproof like the description says, they are! We set the tents up Friday, the wedding was Saturday afternoon and we woke up to rain Sunday morning. Everything under the tents was dry!Solid frame that goes together easily. The velco straps on the walls did not hold up one day for a 2 hour party with 8-10mph winds.This product is CHEAPLY, CHEAPLY made!!! The tarp is SUPER, SUPER thin, the poles are skinny & very weak!! When we were trying to put the top (tarp)on it was a little windy out. The velcro piece ripped right off of the tent. We never did get the top on or were able like to use it. To return it, we had to pay for our shipping which was $100, which we didn't do. There is no contact number or email. On the return slip you shop it to a person. There is a number listed. But when I called the phone rang & then disconnected. We purchased these for a cancer event. Now not only do we need to find others tents we also are getting ZERO money to return them with paying for shipping abd the 20% restocking fee. Uggg.Velcro did not stick well and gusts of wind ripped the Velcro off the side walls. The feet also did not lock into the poles.

Packaging could be sturdier but was delivered with no damage.I bought these for a Honeywell heat exchanger (part of a Carrier heat pump system) and they fit perfectly. I'd tried other aftermarket brand filters and in every case they were a little undersized so they fit loosely into the slot and didn't seal well. If they don't seal well they will leak air around them and the filter will not be effectively filtering out all the dust, spores and particulates. This Honeywell filter is a little more expensive than the aftermarket brands but really well worth it if you want to have less dust, spores, etc., blowing back into the house.So mad. The shipping box was fine but filter not even usable. How can that happen? Was it sent while knowledge of it being defective? Ordered online for convenience but now out the money and time to return.I�ve tried the off-brand filters with the same dimensions and I was not satisfied with the quality so I came back to the originals. You get what you pay for. These filters get changed approximately every 6 months, why not spend a little extra and make sure you�re getting the best. I won�t go back to the off-brand.

Text: Transitional design. Wipe clean vinyl. Plush padding. Swivel Seat. Sturdy and durable ConstructionWell made. Sturdy, comfortable and look great. Price is great too.5 stars BUT..........Totally satisfied with the stools...look great. However, I have a caveat with respect to assembly. Each leg has 2 holes,...one at the bottom for the foot rest and one at the top where the seat part attaches. On my first leg, I simply screwed the bottom screw in first. Then I proceeded to the top screw. While not way off, the alignment wasn't perfect and it was somewhat difficult to get that upper screw all the way in. Same with the second leg. Thereafter, on the 6 remaining legs of my two stools, I screwed in both the upper and lower screws halfway before tightening either of them down. Problem solved. Also, when attaching the assembled legs to the top/cushion portion, make sure that all 4 holes are properly aligned and insert all 4 screws halfway before tightening any of them all the way down. Finally, one of the holes/female part/screw receptors on the upper end, in the leg, loosened from where it was housed so that it kept twisting after I got its screw 90% of the way in. I've assembled stuff like this for decades, so it's not as if this was my first assembly job and I had no experience with this type of thing. Just a 'for what it's worth'.Previously ordered two from online company! I was really glad to have found it on Amazon for better pricing although this batch did have some difficulty with assembling. It took me longer to finish putting the the two stools together. Partial tightening needed for each bolts as otherwise the others get misalignment. Definitely sturdy and the cushion firmer than the previous purchase few years back.Love love love them very comfortable tooItem arrived promptly and was very well-packed (all parts and hardware were accounted for). The stool came in seven parts: four legs, circular kick bar, seat assembly, and top of seat. Follow the instructions to assemble the stool; assembly isn�t difficult and tool is provided. Stool is put together one leg at a time, fastening each leg to a notch in the kick bar and in the seat assembly. I recommend attaching opposing legs to begin with, and using some good quality glue in the joints and screw holes. Remember not to tighten any of the screws on the legs all the way until all four legs are attached, then go ahead and tighten the screws. Same with attaching the top to the seat assembly: do opposite screws and don�t tighten all the way until all four screws are in place. Also, add a little glue between the seat assembly and the seat itself and in the screw holes, etc. After tightening all the screws I found this stool to be incredibly sturdy. It�s solid and well manufactured. I purchased this stool in a beautiful dark espresso finish that is very nice. Be aware when ordering, that the stool you purchase will be the right height for what you need it for.Pro's:","Pro's:

The picture shows a real 26 in luggage. I measured this one and it is less than 23.5 in outside. So it a confusing because this brand sells either a 22, a 26 or a 29... no 23.5 or 24. This size is too large to be a carry on and too small to be a real 50lbs luggage. You would fit at best 35 lbs. it s a pitty because I really liked it.Good suitcase. Seems very sturdy and has lots of room. No issues with the wheels or the pull handle.I�m impressed with this luggage. Sturdy, easy to maneuver, holds a whole bunch of clothes and good looking. I even got a complement from an airline worker about it�s looks.Arrived quickly and was as describedI bought this luggage for my husband. He really likes it! He says the wheels are very smooth. This luggage fit a weeks worth of construction work clothes and construction boots along with comfy clothes.The only downside he said is that when the handle is all the ways up is gets loose.

Text: nanSeems like I never have enough of these things. I have to keep buying more, for all of the cameras and drones that use them. So, I thought I would try these from Gigastone. I did good. These cards work great. I tested each one, to make sure that it was a good card before I packed it with a camera or a drone. Every single card was trouble free. If you need high speed Class 10 cards, and want an economical price, I can honestly recommend Gigastone to you.Perfect for my Wyze cameras. 32Gb is the max for the cameras.(same review as for the 64Gb Gigastone cards:I had a shorting issue with my 3D printer ruining SD cards. (finally found the short and fixed it). Not wanting to keep wasting money on high-brand-name cards, I ordered these Gigastone SD cards. They work great so far. No issues. I installed the controlling software for the 3D printer easily and it is now working again - yay.I also put two inside of my security cameras and two more in my 3D printer monitoring cameras. All five cards are working great with no issue in any device.What really surprised me was that these came with a USB-to-microSD reader. I did not remember seeing that in the product description. This made setting up the 3D printer very easy and it makes working with the SD cards easier since the only reader I have is attached to my CAD/CAM computer. Now I can use the USB device to read SD cards on my laptop.Win-win for me.Purchased this package because I have numerous adapters but did not have additional 32 GB micro cards. This deal makes brick and mortar stores appear SUPER GREEDY. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.best option for digital cameras, dashboard cameras, surveillance camerasI use my memory cards for mostly drone video i fly a mavic air 2 it does like much fasterSd 30v cards but i loose so many of those little pixies i cant see spending all that moneyOn them. I also give them away with some video shots. But they keep up just fine with the dronesI fly just fine.. thanks good product. ,! Will buy againShawnIn oregonPro's:","Pro's:

Text: Long lasting with a touch of sophistication. This is a worthwhile option for your needs. Made from wood. Imported from United States of AmericaPackaging was perfect. All pieces on all four stools were included with clear instructions. Each stool took about 15-20 minutes to assemble, and everything fit perfectly. The stools look good in my new house and I am very happy with them.Also the price was very reasonable fur such quality.We had bought three black stools over 3 months and they get used everyday at our kitchen bar. They appear to be very rugged. My husband weighs 260 lbs and they show no signs of stress. They were very easy to assemble. On each stool, the pieces were all marked and easily put together. The only thing we can find fault with and it really is not a fault of the company; the finish appears to chip easily, but a black marker will cover that and make it unnoticeable. Would diffidently buy againThese are high quality chairs at a super price! They are solid heavy wood with thick faux leather cushions. The chairs swivel smoothly and are very comfortable to sit in. They did take time to assemble but were well worth the work.These chairs were shipped quickly and arrived in good packaging to prevent shipping damage. I did find a little damage to the wood on one of the chairs, but it appeared to be something that happened prior to shipping, and not enough to warrant sending it back. The higher height chairs (29 inch) work perfectly with our new 42 inch high pub table. The white paint even matched, even though I bought the table from another vendor on Amazon. The assembly instructions are not very clear. When you attach the back to the seat, there is a middle screw and two screws on each end to secure it. Be sure you screw in the middle one first! If you try to do the outside ones first, they don't line up and we thought we were going to have to drill new holes until we figured out that putting the middle screw in first pulled the wood back to align it all. After that, the assembly went well. They are comfortable to sit in!Great chair , very comfortable and easy to put it together. I needed to replace my old countertop chair for the kitchen.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: nanFirst impression out of the box with any Fairtex product is high quality and craftsmanship. The BGV9 exceeds this and then some before even slipping them on. I was in the market for a longer cuffed, 16oz glove primarily for bag and mitt/pad work, but able to use and not feel guilty doing drills and technical (light) sparring. I've owned a pair of the flagship BGV1, which are nice, but I didn't like the lack of a grip bar. The BGV9's have a grip bar and probably the most effective one I've tried in a glove of any brand. That said, I was surprised by the size of the hand compartment within the glove. Most all Thai branded gloves are damn near impossible to get a hand in, brand new and I have average size hands at 6' 1"" - 170lbs. These 16oz are caverns. More space from left and right of the hand than length-wise. In fact, they're about a perfect length for me. Making a fist inside feels good. I'm hoping as they break in, they'll conform more around my hand as time goes. We'll see. One thing I love about this glove compared to other Thai brands is the lack of loose fabric within. For regular sparring, I probably wouldn't use these because they are on the harder side. They feel great hitting the pads and bag. Padding on the palm is more than sufficient. Stitching is great and these should last for years with heavy use. Overall I'm pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend them to others.I've tried a good bit of gloves, these are THE best for pad, mitt, and bag work, period. Wrist support is top notch for hard punching, grab bar is great for power and feel, fit is snug and supportive, quality is what you'd expect from Fairtex, price is more than reasonable for handmade premium leather gloves. I walk around at 160-165 and use a 12oz pair of these for everything striking related except sparring.Only downside is the shape and design of these don't work great for MT clinches, which makes sense because they are a more traditional mexican-style boxing glove. If you are sparring in Muay Thai, I recommend the BGV1 for that, Fairtex's bread and butter MT glove. But for pad/bag work I LOVE these because of the additional wrist support.I have these (BGV9) in 12oz for pad/mitt/bag work and the BGV1 in 16oz for sparring. That glove quiver should handle anything you throw at it for several years, provided you take proper care of your gear. Use deodorizers after each session, don't leave your gloves in your bag wet, apply leather conditioner monthly to keep the surface soft and supple (any real leather gloves will crack if you don't do this, it's not a quality issue, it's a user issue).Lastly, there is no doubt these are REAL FAIRTEX GLOVES, but you can get fakes from weird third party sellers here on Amazon, so pay attention when you buy. Mine came in the factory plastic sealed with an authentic Fairtex tag on it. When you select your size/color, read carefully and only buy from ""Fairtex Official"" (fulfilled by Amazon). That guarantees you are buying products stocked directly from Fairtex to Amazon. Anyone else I wouldn't trust.I was excited to get my first pair of ""higher end"" gloves, but when I put them on they were insanely rough on my knuckles and loose... I don't have dainty little hands, I'm a 6' 215 lb man with an athletic build... these gloves are awful and to be honest a bit dangerous. If I were to put effort into my punches I could have injured my knuckles or my wrists. I wish I could give the crooks who sold this 0 stars... and punch them in the head with real Fairtex gloves.These are boxing gloves, not Muay Thai gloves. They are excellent quality. Be warned, they will feel quite stiff when you first use them. It may be a little tough to squeeze your hands through the wrist portion for a couple weeks. There may be some stiff and uncomfortable edges inside the glove. However, THEY DO BREAK IN after a few weeks. The gloves get more supple and comfortable. You won't notice those stiff spots on the inside anymore. Now they feel like a dream to wear. The gloves are very well made. The wrist support is fantastic so you can really wail away on that heavy bag.I have been wanting these gloves for a long time. I saw all the reviews and they just seemed amazing. I finally bought the gloves and have had them for about 2 months now. In the end I was impressed by some stuff, and disappointed by other stuff to a point where I am regretting buying these.To start off, the gloves looks great. They are made from really good quality materials. Real leather. They feel like tanks and will probably last you for a long time.They are also really stiff, and are great for the heavy bag. I would not use these for sparring much, unless you want to hurt the person across from you. In that case, get ready to lose a sparring partner. There is just no give on the foam.The biggest thing against these gloves is the comfort. I have 12 different boxing gloves and these are the most uncomfortable gloves by a mile. It's because of that second grip bar all the way in the glove by your finger tips. I have bigger thick hands, and every time it feels so uncomfortable and my fingers go numb if I use these gloves for a longer period of time. I really wish I could return these and buy something else. Be careful of that second grip bar. I see what they were trying to do, but there is a reason why most other gloves don't shove another grip bar by young finger tips.Still giving them 3 stars for being a good value for money glove with great quality and durability, but I can't give them more since they are not usable for me and are extremely uncomfortable.Pro's:","Pro's:
-High quality and craftsmanship
-Effective grip bar

The top of the tent is high density mesh, very breathable, we can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the sky when lying inside.. KTT Camping tent not only focus on the quality, but also pay attention to its practicality.I love this tent. Super easy setup. As with most tents, you'll want to get heavier duty stakes (why do they always come with those thin metal pencil sticks?). Endured three intense, multi-hour downpours in this thing. The only leaking happened during the first downpour, and only the tiniest bit in the corners. Some waterproofing spray once we'd dried out fixed that easily. Next two: no leaks at all. The ventilation in this thing is excellent. Did not experience that icky damp tent issue.It's super roomy, but still packs up light and compact.My only complaint is the front awning/rainflap. It's not wide enough to have open during rain without rain coming into the tent. But that's a very minor complaint.TLDR: I have always hated tent camping, but I love it now. This tent is awesome.I purchased the KTT Large Tent 8-10 person in Browness July 27th, 2021 arrived early within days! Prompt shipping from company, everything in tact/pieces & Great delivery!1. TAKE YOUR TIME PUTTING THIS TENT UP THAT IS KEY! (IMPORTANT) There are hidden Velcro tabs under the cover that secure to each of the sides of the tent poles which gives it so much more stability. This keeps the tent from swaying and bending.2.

Text: Enjoy enormous desktop storage space for years to come for photos, movies, music, and more. Designed to work with Windows computers, this external USB drive makes backup, easy with a simple drag and drop. System requirement: Windows 7 or higher operating system. Setup is easy; Just connect the external hard drive to your Windows computer for automatic recognition no software required. Includes an 18 inch USB 3.0 cable and 18 watt power adapterWithout question, this is the loudest external drive I have ever owned. It's so loud, man.You don't want this thing in the room with you if you're trying to watch tv or just straight up have a conversation.You can barely even sleep in the next room without this thing acting up. I had to place this beast on a soft cloth to try to absorb some of the noise.It seems to work fine otherwise, though. It transfers speedily enough. No problems in that regard.But man, this thing is soCRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH!!!!See what I mean?! Even now it's crunching away on...something. I'm not copying or opening or saving or playing or indexing or time-machining or whatever. It just likes to crunch.I'm not even lying. You gotta believe me. This thing is loud.I appreciate the 10TB of space but I wouldn't recommend this drive, and will not be buying another one.To sum up this whole review:CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH!!!!You have been warned.I bought 2 of these from Amazon for the purpose of shucking them & using inside my case as internal SATA drives. To my great delight the drives inside were ""Seagate IronWolf Pro 14TB NAS"" 7200rpm Internal Hard Drives! (See pics. I numbered my drive & blacked out identifying #s. for pics here) ...The drives were NEW and Pristine. The model externals I bought had the STEB14000402 model number, but I notice those don't seem to be available right now on Amazon since my last purchase. The 14TB external available now is: # STEB14000400. So maybe the STEB14000402 models, at least right now, may have the IronWolf Pro's in them. ...I believe this just varies at any given time though depending on what Seagate has available at the time of manufacture. But you will get I think, either these 7200rpm IronWolf Pro's OR an Exos 7200rpm drive in these externals no matter what the model # is for the 14TB external. ...It seems to be just ""Luck of the draw""! In any case, shucking took 5-10 minutes and the drives do not need any special partitioning or formatting etc. once shucked and installed as bare drives. Windows 10 recognized them the same as when they were attached via USB 3.0 andthey are VERY fast! ...The NEW Ironwolf Pro's are around $200 - $250 MORE if you buy the bare drives. By shucking the externals, you will save a BUNDLE. However, as most who would attempt this know, you will VOID ANY WARRANTY on the drives. The case tabs are going to break when they are shucked/removed from the external enclosures (They are designed that way!) ...So you COULD still put it back together to use for yourself for other drives etc., but you could NOT put the original drive back in and send back to Seagate for warranty repair. They would KNOW it had been shucked is the point. But any drive failure would most likely occur after the 1st year anyway, and that's all the Externals are covered for. ...Just be sure to check your new external using ""CrystalDiskInfo"" and maybe ""Seatools"" before shucking to check for any issues or bad sectors etc. that it could have left the factory with. Check them BEFORE you remove from enclosure! ...These do work great and very fast as just USB 3 externals btw. But if you're brave enough I say ""Shuck it""!**WARNING THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY**I was looking for a few drives to add capacity to my NAS, with all the articles out about SMR and all the issues it causes with ZFS, I did som research. It looked like all of Seagates 10tb drives were CMR (which is a good thing). I rolled the door e and bought two.The case was super easy to remove, no glue holding stuff together, just a piece of aluminum tape. Inside was a Barracuda Compute Pro (as expected). Removed the USB3 interface, and popped them in my NAS. They spun right up, and easily added to my pool. Haven�t had a problem since.Keep in mind below the 10tb Seagate does use SMR (really meant for archives, so ideal for a backup drive) this will cause slow write times. At the time of writing this, all of Seagates 10tb+ drives are CMR and do not suffer the drawbacks of SMR.nanI thought I needed an 8TB drive, but this 10TB was the same price. I can't say, after only a couple of months, if the hard drive is quality and will last a long time. Seagate is hit-and-miss on drives, like most other brands.But then: this is just one of two backup hard drives. Because we all run backups every month, right!? :-) So if it fails, just get another one. Okay, not a glowing review. But then, so long as you stick to 1st tier hard drive makers, I think we are getting as good as it gets: Seagate, Western Digital, and Hitachi/IBM.For every external drive, not just this one: Be SURE to set your Windows Device Manager, Disk Drive, ""Policy"" on this drive to disable Windows caching. Otherwise, you'll not get amazing speeds on any external device. This means you'll have to go old-school with ""ejecting"" the device from the System Tray to assure everything is closed-off on the drive before disconnecting. A minor extra step which is easily compensated by the faster copy times.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Will fit a poster/photo size of 10x14 (inner dimensions).. Uses a flexible plexi glass material for a shatter resistant, less fragile, and lightweight product.. Plexi has a protective semi-translucent film on both sides that must be removed before use.. Option to hang horizontally and vertically with the sawtooth hanger (already included).. MADE IN CHICAGOThe product description stated: ""Hanging hardware inlcuded. All frames come with plexi-glass. Looks just like glass when it is on the wall. ""Ok, (1) no hanging hardware was included. I'll need to figure out how to hang this heavy frame.(2) The plexi-glass doesn't look anything like real glass. It is only semi-translucent, white. You can only see an outline of the picture through it. I had to fit in the print without any cover by taping its back to the cardboard.I wish people who sell things on Amazon took a responsibility for their product and didn't just try to make money. They should understand that sending cheap faulty crap can have very sad consequences. I needed to frame a very special print to give to my husband for our 25th wedding anniversary. Of course I had to make do with this crap and these sellers are keeping my money. But honestly, this was false description of the product on their part and my very special ocxasion was ruined because of that.Worked great on our 24x30 puzzle. Couldn't find this frame size in any local store, so I'm glad that I found this one. I was thinking the piece of plexiglass was going to be a little thicker, but its actually only the same thickness as like 3 or 4 pieces of paper put together. Very thin but does the job. Frame is made of vinyl covered particle board but seems decent quality. This same frame from same company is offered for $1 cheaper on Ebay, but I figured for the extra $1 I'd rather have Amazon's easy return policy in case the puzzle didnt fit inside the frame.I didn't see too many photos sharing what the ""glass,"" wood, and hardware were for this item, so I wanted to post images for others to see. The ""glass"" is a bendable plastic which comes covered for protection (that's the blue you see in the photo where I'm bending it; it came off quite nicely with no problems and the plastic is very crisp and clear). The wood is actually particle board wrapped in a tape- or sticker-like substance which frays a bit at the corners. Hardware is metal sawtooth hangers which you need to hammer in yourself (I opted to use wire-hanging hardware I had instead). The item actually arrived 2 weeks before the estimated arrival date (about a week after I ordered it). Overall, even with the lower quality aspects of this item, I'm very pleased with this purchase. Having been to professional framers to frame artwork, this is a much lower cost in comparison and is definitely equivalent to the price paid for it. I was a bit nervous after I read some of the reviews on here, but would buy from this company again.i was very disappointed with this purchase. i'll be the first to admit, 'you get what you pay for', and while i've gotten lesser-priced frames on Amazon before and was completely thrilled, just not this time. i've included a photo of the 'plexi-glass' for you 'future buyers' to help you decide to NOT buy this one :) for the price there's no point in returning it. i'll find a piece of glass locally and make it work.This is a very good product and value. Based on the reviews, it seems some customers don't realize the plexiglass has clear protective film on BOTH sides. It's crystal clear once you remove both pieces. It comes with a two brackets designed to hang on a single nail or screw, but you may want to do it ""pro"" with two fasteners and a piece of wire.Pro's:","Pro's:

Every little bit helps in being more visible and noticeable to the phone-texting pot-smoking drivers on Denver area roads. I held off a bit because the price is higher than many others, but in the end these LEDS are worth every penny. They look like they are well made from good materials. I wouldn't be surprised to see them priced much higher, but I'm glad they're not.Excellent product, but didn't fit my application because I didn't do any research first. This is an 1156 type bulb base which has one contact point on the bottom. Used for one dedicated function. I.E. turn signal only. What I needed was an 1157 type bulb base which has two contact points for seperate functions. I.E. turn signal and parking light. Still, the bulb is well built and all LEDs operated as they should. Very bright and far superior to the stock glass bulbs. If you only need a single function amber bulb, I would strongly suggest ordering these.nanWorks well in Harley 04 Super Glide. I wasn�t able to plug and play the red brake lights together with these though, maybe it�d work with some sort of load leveling. They are great even in the smoked housing and I�ve had them one riding season, totally worth being seen to spend the extra few bucks. I�m planning to add them to 07 Road Glide next.

Totally changed the game while packing up in the dark.One thing to think about. They have a projector beam, which means the bulb needs to point straight back where you want the light. I originally bought these for my RV, but realized when I went to install them, that my RV bulbs faced up, not out, so the projector-style bulbs didn't work. I ended up installing them in my car, and have been incredibly happy with them!These bulbs are bright. It has a magnifying lens in its tip that helps spread the light beams. I used this in a travel trailer interior light replacing the original 1156 bulb. Its about the same brightness but uses less battery power.Push and turn , good brightness, replace for my tractor lights to led ,Much better headlights on our Craftsman riding lawnmower than the incandescents. Makes night mowing possible.These lights are super bright! I didn't realize what a difference it would make by replacing the bulbs, but these are way brighter than my original ones.

I have purchased probably 50 to 60 various types of frames from Target and one other on Amazon. This is by far THE BEST quality and value and was packaged expertly!!! I ordered this after I had one delivered by Target that arrived in pieces. This was sealed with bumper pieces of foam on it in a box within an Amazon box. I am amazed at the quality for the price!! It is exactly what I was looking for to frame this print for my baby's room. I removed the included mat to make it fit 11�14I used this frame for a painting commissioned by a client. I've been a professional artist for 10 years, and this is the best quality frame for such an inexpensive price that I've ever bought. It came packaged very carefully with a reusable inner box and corner protectors, the frame itself looks great and is well made, the back panel is very well made and stays securely in place, yet is easily removable. It has sturdy sawtooth hangers for either portrait or landscape orientation, and the edges of the glass are rounded and finished-- something you basically never see in frames under $100. Will definitely buy more of these frames in the future!Between you and me I usually spend $10 or less on a picture frame... but I recently purchased a painting I loved and wanted the perfect frame for it, this seemed to be the only one to fit the bill, and WOW. The frame is heavy and nice quality. I didn�t notice any chipping and the frame seemed well packaged. I thought the depth options for the frame were cool too, the deep set photo seems fancy to me compared to just having it pushed to the glass like most frames! My painting is an 11x14 and I felt like the mat was exactly that same size. I would have preferred it to have a little bit smaller of an opening so I didn�t have to be so careful getting the edges perfect. Not sure if my photo is actually a little small or if the mat is cut a little big. But the end result is lovely and I wouldn�t hesitate to order again.The frame is not wood; it is a composite likely made of resin and wood shavings (like a lot of frames these days). It looks like a gray-brown distressed wood. It's a very neutral color. The depth is slightly over 1 inch, but the distance from the rabbet to the frame points is about 3/4 inch, so that is how much you will be able to fit unless you add your own frame points in a different location. You can use a flat head screw driver to fold the points upward toward the wood to lift out the frame package. When you put the frame package back in, use the same flat head to fold them back down. I am going to guess that the metal points will take about three or four ""reframings"" before they snap from folding up and down: not bad. There are two points on the short sides and three points on the long sides. The glass is sanded at the edges, which is nice because it is less likely to cut your fingers when you handle it. The mat appears to be a decent quality. The mat opening is 10 1/2 x 13 1/2. There is a 1/2 inch deep particle board spacer under the mat, giving it a shadow-box effect. The spacer opening is 15 1/2 x 19 1/2, so if you use the spacer, whatever you frame has to be at least that large or it will float loose inside the mat with nothing holding it down. You don't have to use the spacer, though. It is completely removable. The backing gets the lowest score from me. I recommend that you add an archival paperboard backing and toss out the particle-board backing. This is a very acidic material and it will cause paper to yellow over time. It also adds a lot of unnecessary weight. Most art or frame stores will sell you an archival board cut to size. There are some flimsy metal sawtooths embedded in the particle board backing that are intended for hanging. Instead, I recommend adding eye hooks or small d-rings to each side of the frame about a third of the way from the top and stringing wire across. I found it very easy to add the hardware. The ""wood"" is soft, but not too soft. With a few modifications, I am happy with this product.Easy to set up, durable, and looked nicePro's:","Pro's:

FLUID RESPONSE AND MOVEMENTS - Don�t miss a beat with an incredible 144 Hz refresh rate - watch the action unfold in real-time as it was meant to be seen and have the ability to react with a 6 ms response time.

Curved monitors allow users to stay in the game longer by reducing eye strain and fatigue. Spend less time searching and find yourself immersed in your game or work environment.. BEAUTIFUL COLOR REPRODUCTION - 99% sRGB color accuracy lets you see all 16.7 million supported colors at a premium level. Witness captivating deep contrasts with the 4000:1 ratio and find yourself appreciating games, movies, and more like never before.. A MEDIA POWERHOUSE - With multiple connections, turn your monitor into a media hub! Each monitor comes with 2 HDMI 2.0, a DP 1.4 input, and a 3.5mm audio jack for private listening. Each monitor is 75mm x 75mm VESA mount ready, so you can mount on a wall or monitor stand.Went into this purchase a bit skeptical on a monitor with almost no reviews. Looking at the other ultrawide curved monitors on amazon, this one ticks all the boxes, plus some for a fraction of the price.144hz works. Freesync or Gsync. Tried with a vega 56 and rtx 3070. No issues with either. Was a tad worried about this as the description listed adapative sync and nothing specific. It works with either.HDR. Yes this works too and something none of the other curved ultra wides offer that I have found. Tried with Horizon Zero Dawn and RE: Village. Can definitely tell a difference between this and SDR. Be sure to enable HDR in the monitor OSD as well as windows display settings.The stand is nice and sets it apart from most of the others. You can adjust the height, tilt, and rotation.Gorgeous monitor so far with 0 dead pixels. It is still very early but so far my expectations have been exceeded.I was skeptical moving from an IPS based monitor to a VA panel monitor. The screen on this is phenomenal. Colors are beautiful, rich, bright and immersive. I was also worried about driving these with my old Nvidia Geforce 970 video card (since getting a new one seems impossible these days). I didn't need to worry. The card drives two of these monitors with ease, but I did have to use the DisplayPort cable to get native resolution at the 144hz refresh rate.. HDMI wouldn't go beyond 1920x1080 for me.The curve is just right. Pronounced enough to fit nicely on my not-very-wide desk. The stands are great, adjustable height and don't take up too much real estate. I feel these monitors are well designed and deliver. Looking forward to using them for many years to come.This product is advertized as a 144Hz refresh rate but in fact it is a 100Hz refresh rate. Don't buy this monitor if you want a gaming one with 144Hz refresh rate.Overall the picture is great when it works, but this was a dud. It worked for less than a week, then it would sporadically lose picture and fail to regain it. I tried with a laptop and two different desktops and DP/HDMI and the same issue would happen. Also, none of the buttons worked. Not even the power button. I'm returning for a more well-known brand.The picture quality for everyday web browsing and work is far too small to be of use. Moving the mouse from upper left to lower right in an MMO is a chore and seems to take longer. This is best for controller run and shoot type games. The picture quality is amazing.Pro's:","Pro's:

And it's even the size it was advertised as. I can use it to frame things. It's not extremely versatile: you can only frame things that are 16x16 or frame nine smaller pictures that are about 4x4. It won't tend bar at a party or wash your car. But the seller didn't make any rash promises about how it would tend bar for you at parties or wash your car, and I really didn't expect it to tend bar or wash my car, so I can't complain. It's a frame. For pictures, you know. A picture frame. And it works as that sort of thing. So I give it five stars. But only as a picture frame. Not as a bartender or car-wash lackey.I looked at several like this, my friends. This one is more expensive and takes longer to arrive, but it is worth the wait and the money. Don't make me say I told you so...I needed 6 frames that would hold a 12X12 photo and leave a 2 inch space for a 2 inch mat. These are the only reasonably priced frames I could find. I just took out the mat that they come with and used my own. They have a great brushed aluminum sort of finish and are really sturdy. They're easy to load and have real glass.

I will admit it is a MONSTER to assemble!!! Please plan for at least 4 hours with one person really knowing about assembly. Otherwise, it will be longer for one person, maybe impossible or with 2 people that aren�t used to assembling. My desk came with a cabinet that thing is huge in comparison to what I was expecting.

The laptop pocket is the perfect size to hold my 15"" Lenovo Chromebook, charger and mouse with plenty of room to spare and the padding is protective. I like the little velcro tab that holds the padded walls of the pocket in place. The outside pocket is more than enough room for my iphone 8 plus. I love that the key ring is on the end of a ribbon on the inside right where you unzip the bag so it is never hard to find my classroom keys. The umbrella holder is also on that side so you can easily access it when you need it. It is made out of water repellant material that feels nice and cleans super easily. While I love all these things, my favorite by far is the shoulder strap. I am a very heavyset woman and cross-body straps are NEVER long enough but this one is. It makes it easy to carry my bag, and still have my hands free for my coffee cup and whatever else I may need to carry.Update 2.I love it the more I use it.It carries my Mac book, files, personal items and I can find things easily.I wear designer bags and needed something for work instead of using designer totes. I didn�t like the brown trim at first. Thought it looked cheap but after I wore it a bit it broke in abs looks great!I would buy another!I purchased this end of April and about a month and half of using it the long strap broke. I carry a new Macbook Pro laptop and a portfolio. Pretty disappointed about that.I can fit my 15.6"" dell latitude ( bag would accommodate a larger laptop though), wireless mouse and keyboard, headset, charging cord, wallet, cell phone & charger, 2 legal pads,pens, my planner and file folders. Could fit more but that's enough weight to carry around already. This bag is great! Seems sturdy enough and has some padding to it to protect electronics. Note, the bag does not come with a power bank, only a connection on the outside that you can plug your usb cell phone charger into and use the front pocket to store your phone (there is a cord inside the bag that you can connect to a power bank of your own)I use my bag for a work bag. I have a 16"" laptop and carry that along with several other note books and all my client's files. I like that it is easy to keep clean, wipe down if needed and has the charger built in. The bag itself is flexible than a leather bag, it is a light weight material and does not add to the overall weight to carry. I would recommend it.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: CONTENTS: 1 Frame. Fits 16x24 inch Photos or Posters. Please MEASURE YOUR PICTURE to ensure it is 16x24 exactly before buying. Black Color, Wood MDF Material. Plexiglass Front Face (NOT GLASS). Please peel off the PROTECTIVE FILM from both sides of the plexiglass for better visibility.. FRAME BORDER and BACKING: Border width: 1 inch (2.54 cm). Thickness: 0.6 inch (1.5 cm). Black backboards and back hooks for hanging frame (Landscape and Portrait).. EXACT FIT: A 16x24 photo fits the frame entirely without matting. The frame itself is larger than the picture size by 0.75 inch on each side (outer frame dimension of 17.5 x 25.5 inch). The picture display area is slightly smaller than the photo size by 0.25 inch on each side, for holding purposes (picture display area of 15.5 x 23.5 inch).. FULLY ASSEMBLED: The frames will arrive fully assembled. Please hang the frames using the already installed back hooks. Do not hang by the frame border itself. Display picture included. These frames have no matting (please purchase separately).. QUALITY: These Black Wood Frames feature a sleek surface finish and front face that will complement your displays. Suitable for Photos, Posters, Documents, Certificates, and more.These aren�t the most high quality/fancy frames, but they were exactly as expected for the price! I needed a large number of frames for some movie posters and didn�t want to spend $300+ just on the frames. These are perfect. Came well packaged and had no damage. As it states in the listings the larger frames have plexiglass rather than real glass. There is also a protective film on both sides of the plexiglass that needs to be peeled off.The frame was exactly as promised, which is reassuring as I have purchased frames in the past that did not quite match the dimensions as advertised. This frame seemed sturdy and looks nice on the bedside table. I am very satisfied with my purchase.Being a framer I found it odd that everything got held in place using a point driver- I did not find them easily bendable, probably because my arthritic hands. This might throw a person not familiar with point drivers off. Just a thought.Waste of money. I was very careful putting in a poster and out of nowhere the frame breaks off on one of the corners. Not happy with this at all. I'm beyond mad especially since it took so long for this to ship. I know it's not their fault with the shipping delay due to the pandemic. But imagine waiting weeks to get the frame and then finally it comes and breaks instantly. It's super delicate. Don't take your chances on this.Was looking for 12x18 frames with plexiglass for artwork for my son's room. I didn't want glass above his bed, and these frames stood out even though they're pretty inexpensive. They're well manufactured, and the corners are tight and line up perfectly. The plexiglass, though thin, is protected on both sides with transparent film that you remove, but do so carefully as flex marks are easy to leave when the plexi is this thin. The frames were also extremely well packed. I'm very happy with my purchase as well as the seller. These are a great value!Pro's:","Pro's:

A delicious multi-layered protein bar that delivers balanced nutrition and a soft, yet crunch texture all in a gluten free package. Packed with 16 grams of protein in each multi-layered bar, plus they contain no GMOs and is low in sugar (5 grams) and only 12 grams of net carbs. Our protein bars feature your favorite flavors, plus they're packed with all the nutrients you need and none of the fillers you don't. Use as a snack to help boost your protein intake, or break up into smaller pieces to spread them throughout the day to curb your appetite. Our protein bars are banned-substance tested and manufactured in a GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant facility. We care about the products you put into your bodyThese are sweet. Almost too sweet. And they definitely have the weird consistency of a protein bar. They�re not worth the price. I guess I need to stop listening to bloggers who get paid to promote items!These bars are low calorie, low fat and low sugar. Considering the great macros these taste amazing. All you people writing reviews saying they taste horrible or they don't taste fresh. Guess what they are not fresh lol they're prepackaged bars lol. THose of you saying they don't taste good, you are all probably used to eating like trash and eating snickers bars all day. If you generally eat healthy and don't eat fast food everyday, you will enjoy these. Take it from someone who has been in the fitness industry most of my life, these taste better than most protein bars out there. Believe me I've tried them ALL. Yes there might be some that taste a little better but those have triple the sugar and fat content. These are a good snack. Not a meal replacement.I give these 5 stars. They taste good and have a nice wafer like crisp which I like. They taste (to me) like a nutty bar but less sweet. These do not look like wafer bars by the way. They kinda resemble a baby Ruth bar except fatter. They are fairly large too. I could do half now and half later kinda deal. I can get these cheaper in my area, but I did not want to go put to the store so I chose to pay an extra $5 and purchased them on Amazon.I love the Alani Nu protein bars, chocolate is my personal favorite. I got my blueberry muffin ones off Amazon because the Alani website is out of stock on every flavor. My ONLY complaint (probably if I would have purchased directly from them) is that I would happily pay a bit for shipping if they were shipped with temperature control. They came slightly melted because of the heat (I knew it was likely to happen) and they still taste great! Just a little something to maybe offer if its price effective and people are willing to pay! Because I definitely am willing to pay for it!Box was supposed to have 12 bars, arrived with 10. Very odd. Obviously it had been returned then resold. For $31 dollars I expect at 12 bars.

Today was a turning point in my naive line of thinking. I felt like I went to a yard sale and got ripped off. This frame is nicked from head to toe, whether very obvious or very faint. I was going to put a very meaningful picture in this frame as a Christmas gift for my fiance, but that will definitely not be happening. At first I was thinking ""hmm maybe it won't be so noticeable"", but the more and more I stared at this thing, my eyes hurt thinking of the pain that this frame endured (andddd couldn't get over the visibly chipped black paint). The packing style was actually very well done and very secure - which is concerning because there was really no possible way this was damaged in shipping...meaning that someone knew this was damaged and shipped it anyway. I'm beyond frustrated with my experience with this frame and company. Additionally, depending on where you live (US), you may get slapped with a small international fee that appears out of no where, and is not mentioned in the process at all. If you don't believe the negative comments, I was just like you so please believe this one when I say, save your money and go elsewhere!For the price these frames were wonderful. We bought three to frame our 3 year olds art work to add color to our home. The frame was tightly packaged when it arrived and we were fortunate to have no scratches on our frames (yay!). The frames all ahead the hanging wire and looked amazing when we put them up.The same frames at Michaels and other stores were double/triple the price. We were very pleased with our frame purchase. Amazon for the WIN. Thanks Amazon!Was pleasantly surprised with how durable it is. There were a bunch of black frames available, some with sketchy review histories so I thought I'd let everyone know this was a good one.I used it for my poster of one of my favorite song lyrics from MercyMe as well as a great movie. It looks gorgeous hanging in my bedroom where I see and read it every day!!! Beautiful frame!!It�s a decent frame for the price point. It is plexiglass and came with a covering on the front so it didn�t get scratched (which is what�s bunched up on the picture). The back has multiple hangers so you can choose how you want to hang it.

I am very pleased with these panels overall and will add to this review after completion of this project.The overall quality of these panels are excellent and they are tall enough to set up my pop-up at it's tallest setting. the zippered corners are a fantastic addition and the velcro corner buckles (when using just one panel) are sturdy and well designed.The fabric is far superior to the single panel I bought preciously which was too small and a crappy fit for more $$.These are the best I've found to meet my needs.This was a lifesaver at the beach with our grandchildren! The wheels were nice and helped instead of having to carry it. Set up was easier with 2-3 people, but once it was set up, we really appreciated having shade. The sidewall helped greatly as well! I would definitely recommend for anyone headed to the beach for a day.We took it to a windy beach - it stood strong while others around us blew awayThis is a great canopy. It is a quick canopy to get to the full open position, with a simple center locking mechanism. All you have to do is push the center up and it locks in place with no other locking points at the four corners. The leg poles are also easy to use with no small metal button to get your fingers snaged by. It has a rocking switch that you just push and pull your legs down. Also this thing is huge!!!!!

This is an industry standard. Your computer reads things in multiples of 1,024... so 1,024 bytes is a KB, 1,024 KB is a MB... 1,204 MB is a GB, etc... But all drives are sold in multiples of 1,000. So if you buy a 512GB card, and do the math... device makers are saying that card is 512,000,000,000 bytes. But divide that by 1,024 and your operating system will see it as 476.84GB. Beyond that, you also lose a small percentage for the ""file system"" index on the drive. So you may see a few GB less even. In my case, I have a 256GB card, which shows up as 238GB, which is exactly as expected. The description on this listing explains this with the text:1MB=1,000,000 bytes. 1GB=1,000,000,000 bytes. 1TB=1,000,000,000,000 bytes. Actual user storage less.That explained, I tested my card's speed to see if it hits the 120MB/s ideal... not really. But marketing hype being what it is, I'm sure the ""Speed up to 120/MB/s**"" is in perfectly ideal conditions with specific readers and file sizes and the like... so my test of 93MB/s on a 10 year old USB 3 card reader with the SD adapter is acceptable to me. I think this should work fine on a soon to arrive Nintendo Switch for the kids. I'll update this review if any surprises come up that should be noted.Works great and is less than the Nintendo Branded one.Got the 1TB microSD on a deep sale to use for my Switch because I don't want to worry about storage for the rest of my mortal existence.Is 1TB overkill for a Switch?

Made of Solid wood in walnut finish and Ready to Assemble.. Seat height is 30.12""Everything went great however the wood screws cracked the wood. The manufacturer doesn't recommend this however I will use glue instead on the replacement. Glue bond is actually stronger than wood. So the glued dowels should actually be stronger than screws in wood... Still a fabulous deal for the money. I just forgot about the glue idea proposed by a different reviewer. Glue was my original intention... However the screw won out in my mind....These just arrived and I was so excited to get them that I asked my husband to please put them together after work if at all possible, and I�m not usually that impatient. I�ve had slipcovers for chairs like these for two years and just needed the chairs, so I was sitting on pins and needles to get them all together! Well, my husband, who is super handy, had a really tough time being able to assemble even one. First off, no instructions were included, then he realized there wasn�t nearly enough hardware to put them together, and finally the many pieces were damaged, broken and misaligned, ugh! I went from being excited about them to feeling bad for my hubby that I ordered them. I had no idea there would be this many obstacles to simply putting two bar stools together! He was eventually able to figure out how to get one out together using hardware he had on hand in his workshop, so I could at least be able to see what two would have looked like. I gave a three star rating because Amazon customer service was able to help me resolve these issues without more headaches, but I give the bar stools themselves one or two stars due to no instructions, lack of hardware, and the pieces not being machined well enough to avoid alignment issues, etc.Good chairs, they hold up pretty good.I ordered these extra stools to go along with the Winsome pub table & stools - they are a perfect match in wood finish. The wood is solid & has a super nice finish. They were a bit more difficult to put together by myself because the rungs had to be lined up before tightening. With a second person, it would have been a piece of cake.These bar stools are exactly what I�ve been looking for. Great rich color and sturdiness. I added these adorable 16x16 seat cushions and I am in love with how they look. My husband put them together in no time. Great for the money!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Faux Leather. Imported. Constructed with solid hardwood. 360-degree steel ball-bearing swivel plate. Slightly flared legs for stable seating. Durable footrest. Black faux leather upholstery. High-density foam cushionThis stool is excellent quality and is a GREAT value. I am a finicky customer who has been a product guy for most of his career, so I don't say this lightly. I am so impressed that I am writing a detailed review for those that want the details. To be precise, I would give this product 4-1/2 stars if it were possible, but I am rounding up to 5 rather than down to 4.Packaging- as others have noted, the packaging is exemplary. and explains why each piece arrived in perfect condition. It takes 15 minutes to completely unpack everything and lay it out for assembly. It's worth every minute! Others have complained that they couldn't find the hardware. My boxes arrived with a red plastic tag on the outside of the box labeled ""hardware"" and when you open the box you realize that tag is connected to the hardware package. Clearly, they listened to the feedback and made it painfully obvious where the hardware is.Wood and Finish- While the description calls this ""cherry"" finish I would describe it as a medium mahogany color. The wood itself appears to be some kind of Asian mahogany such as luan (Phillipino mahogany). The color goes very well with my medium cherry cabinets and Brazilian cherry floor.I am a woodworker and am very impressed with the finish. It is a satin finish, and examining all of the pieces of three stools, it is damn near perfect in any area that shows.Construction- all of the pieces fit together very well. Every bolt engages with a metal threaded insert. You will not be driving any wood screws. All of the bolts are Allen screws so you can crank them good and tight. The foot rest is sturdy, not a flimsy piece of wood. Just the same, I wouldn't stand on it.As I was assembling the first one, I noticed that the swivel was a bit stiff. Rest assured that once assembled and with your weight on it, the stool swivels readily. I'm going to guess that they made it a little tight so kids wouldn't spin on it Probably some do-gooder in Washington mandated that so kids couldn't have fun. ;-)Assembly- the instructions are sufficient but not elaborate. And I might add, they are only helpful if you look them over before beginning assembly. Naturally, I did not do that before assembling my first stool. The most important lesson learned from that is that it really does matter that you assemble these in the order of the steps outlined.The assembly steps are, 1) attach the four legs to the foot rest, 2) attach the ""apron"" (ring below the seat), (note that the instructions present the preceding two steps as one step), 3) attach back to seat, 4) attach assembled seat to swivel mount. The bolts are very clearly labeled as are the washers, and an Allen wrench is included. Here are a few notes and tips:1. All bolts are installed with flat washers. All bolts also use lock washers EXCEPT for the final four that attach the seat to the swivel.2. If you don't follow the recommended order, you will find it very awkward to get at some of the bolts.3. First assemble the legs and two rings FINGER TIGHT. A very common mistake is to snug each bolt as you install it and then complain that things don't line up. Once the legs and the rings are loosely assembled, set the unit on a flat surface (I used my granite kitchen island) and then tighten. I recommend you tighten the seat ring first, and then foot rest.4. The Allen wrench has a ball tip on one end- this is a great feature for turning the bolt head from an angle when necessary, until the final half turn of tightening.5. I put an old towel down on my counter so nothing would get scratched.6. The bolts and washers are oily when they come out of the package. I would have a rag handy to wipe them off while you assemble.7. I found it helpful to use my metric Allen wrench set (shown as it provides a great handle and also can be bent 90 degrees.8. The bottom of the seat back where it attaches to the seat is a slightly wider arc than the seat base. You might be concerned about a gap when you first line them up. Start all six bolts, and then snug up the center first before the outside bolts. As you tighten you will see it pull the center of the seat back closer to the seat bottom until it is flush. Then tighten the outside bolts.The assembled unit is very attractive and looks like it could have cost double or more. The seat cushion itself is on the firm side. I have very little padding on my back side (!) so I would have preferred a bit more padding on the seat. The seat back is VERY comfortable.Although these are proper counter height, I would have preferred if they were an inch or two taller. I measured the under-counter clearance and it is pretty much as it should be. But I'm on the shorter side, so I would have preferred sitting slightly higher. Bar height stools would have been too tall.To sum up, if you like the look of these, go for it. I am deeply impressed with the quality and the value they represent. If anything changes, I'll come back and update this review. Here are a few pictures to give you a better idea.I read the good & bad reviews and C.H. O�Briens review had it right as a woodworker. I�m a mechanic and capable also. I realize after most of you read this, you may just order them from a real furn. store and avoid this explanation as follows, but for those like me who like to save some cash and don�t mind a little work for a BETTER outcome then some of you have experienced, then you can�t go wrong with their value, IMO.I Put together two and followed Obriens advice which was spot on. Each chair was well packaged and so fresh that the wood finish was still strong (odor) but not so bad that you cleared the room. First I lubed the swivel bearings with (drops of heavy oil-see pics) as one was not fully seated in its frame, but not bad enough to hurt this assembly. They were very stiff as they are a press fit assembly (not a critical tolerance part like a wheel bearing) and extra lube helped them a lot. Then I removed all the wood screws (one at a time and replaced) using few drops of gorilla glue on them as a locktite. You can also use slow dry ethyl cyanoacrylate (crazy glue types) if you prefer but you have to move much faster which leads to mistakes which is a poor outcome, IMO.DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN ANY of THE FASTENERS, especially the four seat pad wood screws. If you strip out the seat pad holes, then you turn the pad approximately 1� and restart the screws in a fresh spot, and add glue. (A couple were stripped from the factory assembly but problem solved)!This is key to a good outcome and why locking the screws now and letting the chairs sit for 24 hours letting the Locktite cure before use will make for a better seat assy. In long term use, IMO.After checking that all the machine screws would turn freely in the metal inserts by finger in every hole, I then started assembly of the legs and rings but leave them very loose till the seat is on. Put the seat back on the seat pad (as it rests on a table or another stool) useing locktite on the threads and tighten. Leave the seat pad/back upside down and place the legs/bearing assy. on to the seat bottom and lock tight the four machine screws here also. (Legs are still loose). Now turn the whole chair assy. over on a level table/counter and put two drops of Locktite on each leg machine screw thread one at a time (where the threads begin) leaving it one turn out from loose. Now tighten each screw snug and go to the next one. After all snug, repeat tight, and repeat one more time around. This helps keep the legs from having an unbalanced teetering effect when on the floor afterwards.I know, sounds like a headache in explanation, but the physical application is really straight forward.Good luck with yours. RH-Tx.Thank goodness it was so well packaged. Fedex clearly put a forklift tine through the side of it, and then put it on my porch upside down under the other chairs so maybe I wouldn't notice? Despite the box damage, which appears out of the seller's control, the chair was unscathed. The packaging was a good move, guys, I forgave the pain it was to open. These barstools are well-made and they match my bar perfectly. Although there are a few off- color putty repairs from the nicks and scrapes of the manufacturing process, the finish is overall pleasing. Mine is in cherry, and the workmanship is better than expected. I suspect they package the locking washer and washers by weight, though, each package was off here and there from what I needed. Not a biggie. For the price, it's a decent barstool. The seat is a little more shallow than you would expect given how the back is assembled. It's not as cushiony as it looks, but not entirely uncomfortable either. And I did, after all, work pretty hard to break those bad boys in... and even after wrenching my back last week, I was comfortable seated on them in my recovery. I bought two to see if I'd like them. Will get a few more to accommodate the family, as the ""bar"" is really only used every other weekend, and it's a ""coffee bar"" the rest of the time. Nice. Recommend you bypass the cheap stuff and just go for these, if you're wavering. However, it is a little weird to see ""Ho chi Min"" on the return label.I purchased 6 of these stools and they are amazing...workmanship is good...these are sturdy stools. I can honestly say that family and friends were impressed with the quality of this stool...also comfortable...install instructions were excellent.I ordered four of these chairs. Amazon had the best pricing, so I took the plunge -- even though I was a bit nervous by some of the reviews (damaged goods or poor quality). I am happy to report that all four of my chairs arrived in perfect condition, with no blemishes at all. As far as I'm concerned, these swivel stools are unbeatable for the price. Hopefully they will stand up over time.Assembling them is super easy. After the first one you get the hang of it and the others will go together without having to look at the instructions. The assembly is based entirely on bolts, lock washers and washers. So pretty straightforward. The main thing to keep in mind is to leave the foot ring bolts a little loose (noted on the instruction sheet) and only tighten them as the very last step. Do this on a flat floor so you can ensure the legs are even.The most ""challenging"" part is when you put the back of the chair onto the padded seat. This is because it's a semi-circle, so some of the screws can bind a little if you're not careful. Leave them all fairly loose until you get all six into place and then begin tightening them equally back and forth. This will ensure the pieces come together with the least amount of binding pressure.All in all I would recommend these stools. They are extremely well packaged. One final tip to make things go faster. Before you put any bolts in, separate all the bolts into groups and add all the washers onto the bolts in the proper order. Then, it's really quick to put it all together.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: 95% Cotton, 5% Spandex. Imported. Pull On closure. Machine Wash. ?SWEATPANTS FEATURES: Women cotton sweatpants are soft, breathable and stretchy and do not deform, pill and fade easily as to provide maximized durability. We make your movements free and your life convenient.. ?DETAILS: Elasticated ribbed waistband with drawstring for a custom fit?Flatlock stitching and ribbed taping at sides?2 zippered pockets and added mesh inserts within the pocket for secure storage. ?EASY CARE--Gentle machine wash below 30 degree Celsius or hand washThese sweatpants are exactly like the Athleta ones for 89$! Literally everything looks the same down to the smallest of details! I have not washed them yet and did size up. For reference, I�m 5�5� 132 lbs and ordered a large as suggested. They are loose but comfy and don�t look all saggy or too big if you aren�t used to wearing joggers more fitted which I am not. According to the sizing chart I guess I would have met criteria for a small but I like the fit of the large. I actually had the Athleta ones in hand I had ordered as well and thought it�s crazy to pay this much for the same looking product. They appear to be of equal quality but if not, hey, I can order 2 to replace these for one of the Athleta brand. Love love love them. The zippers add a classy touch and also serve to slim the hip area (not that that�s a concern for me) but also are functional for your phone, etc. I�m ordering two more pair. One in every color! Please make a navy!!!!!!Purchased these zipper pocket jogger sweats for myself but they fit a bit more snug than I like. I�m 5�7� 135 and I ordered a medium my usual size. I gave them to my daughter who is a small and they fit comfy and loose like we like them. If you want a more formed fit order your usual size. They are made very well. Super comfy. I just ordered another grey and black pair in a large. After I wash and dry they should fit the way I like. Loose and for loungingThese are comfortable. At 5 foot 4 inches and 160 lbs, I purchased XL per the chart, but I think L would have fit better. These are 5 inches above my bellybutton, so they are definitely high-wasted pants. I was hoping for a thicker main fabric, but it is on the medium/light side. They are well made, but the fabric (after being washed 1 time) seemed to attract and collect the lint, cat hair and people hair from all the clothes in the wash. We have top-of-the-line washer and dryer, so they aren't to blame. It is something about this fabric. I will need a lint roller...However, Since I purchased these for around the house, I am still happy because they are comfortable.Very nice jogger pants! Comfortable, good quality and nice length if you�re on the tall end of average height.So glad they were long enough. Most jogger pants run short for me (I�m almost 5�7�).I truly find these joggers the best I've ever owned. From the moment I put them on it was instant comfort. The inside is extremely soft and the elastic high waist with the drawstring does in no way constrict. The zippered pockets with the interior net pocket for keys or change are my overall favorite. I have room for my phone and small things I can't live without. You can also wear them a bit dressy with the addition of a blazer, etc. I hope they come back in stock soon so I can order more.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Wi-Fi ready Connected room air conditioner with Frigidaire smart app for mobile operation. 2017 energy star: 12.0 energy efficiency Ratio (EER). Window-mounted installation with new modern design (uses standard 115V electrical outlet). Power Cord Length: 72 inches. 12,000 BTUs cools up to a 550 square foot room with 3.8 pints per hour dehumidification. Use your smart device to turn the unit on or off, change temerature, control modes and adapt fan speedsThere are two major reasons why I'm disappointed in this purchase and regret it:As many people have said, the WiFi connection is a total disaster! I figured it was just a bunch of people without a lot of experience connecting with smart devices, but no, it really is the worst system you've ever seen. We (both programmers) spend hours trying to get it set up, and in the end, it only worked for one of us.Even after it is ""working"", getting it working with Google Home is another slap in the face. After getting it set up, the way you control it is by issuing a long command like ""Hey Google, ask Frigidaire to turn air conditioner temperature to 72."" Google will respond with voice (as always), but then it has to call up the Frigidaire app, which then also feels the need to talk to you and repeat the same stuff. So, even with everything working it takes like 10 seconds from saying ""Hey Google"" to have the thing respond.The second thing is that the unit arrived damaged in four different places. (See photos). This was not a UPS mishandling in any way--the unit was already damaged before it was packaged, because the packing materials and the box are all in perfect condition! Another damage that I couldn't even take a picture of was that two of the ""paddles"" that allow you to adjust the air output direction were popped out of their little plastic holes and were rattling around in an area that you can't easily get to. It took some needle-nose pliers and a chopstick and another fifteen minutes of my time to re-set the paddles.I gave two stars strictly for the looks of the unit. But as for build-quality, basic quality control/inspection at the factory, and the garbage smartphone app, I would give a big fat zero!I had to buy a unit for another bedroom a few days ago, and I went with a more highly rated GE model. (I don't mean rated on Amazon; I mean rated on a legitimate ratings forum, namely Consumer Reports).Incidentally, I have other Frigidaire products that are great. It is sad that they really dropped the ball on this one.I bought this frigidaire 10,000btu ac for my Birthday (the gift that keeps on giving). I have been running the air conditioner for a month now and it is as quiet, doesn't rattle like some other store off brand air conditioners I use to use.The Bluetooth does work great, You have to add the Frigidaire unit to your WiFi network. It is a little tricky at first, eventually figured it out.Since the ac is in the bedroom, I only need to set the temp at 73� or 74� for a cool nights sleep.It doesn't take long for the room to cool down.The Bluetooth is a great feature. I tested this on my day off. I set the ac to automatic turn on at 3pm at 74�, when 3pm rolled around the ac kicked on as my Bluetooth request,Now I come home to a cool bedroom.I highly recommend this air conditioner 100%.update 5/29/18Every time the electric goes out at the apartment or a down internet the Frigidaire app gets 'lost connection' then when the electric and WiFi come back on I have to delete the air conditioner from the app account and do the set up process all over again which is a pain in the neck, the air conditioner app never reconnects when it suppose to automatically. The Frigidaire website with the question and answer: states; if power is lost to the entire house, your router will be disconnected from the internet as well, thus disconnecting the appliance. The good news is that as soon as power is restored the appliance will automatically re-connect and function normally without user intervention. If you are connected and running at the time of the power loss, you may receive a connection lost notification.Everything is a 5 star except for the app. I wish Frigidaire sends an app update to fix the issue.Update 11/2019 year and 7 months later the compressor is making an annoying noise which makes it hard to get to sleep. So, I put the fan on only which doesn't help with lowering the temps. It is still hot hereWorst AC unit I have ever owned. Not only is it insanely loud, the materials are so cheap the whole thing rattles like crazy, but it gets worse... it leaks... from the front! After a few days of heavy use ince it�s turned off it puts water out of the front ruining anything near it. You think �maybe the filter needs cleaning� nope after a good cleaning it decides to spit water all over you in your sleep. BUY ANY OTHER AC POSSIBLE. They may have invested in design but thi AC is absolute garbage. Not only the worst AC I have ever owned, this is the worst consumer electronics product I have ever owned.We have central air but also use a window unit in our 3rd floor bedroom which just never gets cold with the central system. I was going to buy the 6000BTU model, but realized that this 8000 BTU one would also fit in our very narrow windows and went with this one. It fit perfectly in our 23"" window. Working alone, I had it unboxed, assembled and installed in under 20 minutes, and it looks better than any window air conditioner that I've ever seen before. It's quiet and it is nice and cold and it dropped the temperature down very quickly! I don't know why others have complained about the controls on the unit, they are VERY straight forward and easy to use...unless you've never used ANYTHING electronic before in your entire life. The same for the remote control, it's easy to use and handy. It hooked up to our internet quickly and easily and has been working flawlessly with the IOS app.I already have the 8000 BTU version and I LOVE being able to control and view the temperature of my apartment when I am not home!Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Built-in Wi-Fi. Smart Home/voice Command Device Compatibility. Wide Air Discharge Vents. Counterweights Dampen Vibration And Decrease SoundCooling is awesome. If you can get it to turn on. Remote is useless unless you stand 1 foot in front of unit. WiFi does not work. Impossible to connect.Overall this is a disappointment considering Freidrich reputation.The AC came damaged, had to return it and it�s a hassle because it�s sold thru a 3rd party.This ac is great and is fully capable of cooling my house quickly and efficiently. The remote and the app work perfect and easy to use.My only complaint is the noise level. I wish there was a few more modes on the fan. The low is still very powerful and loud.It's not a deal breaker but it is loud enough that I did have to change my original placement.Cools really well. Cooling is excellent. Only experienced 90 degree days remote sucks. No back lighting, modes on the unit are backlighted. Apple iPhone wanky. Don�t care about noise quiet is no an issue for me. Love the sound. Will review more after we hit 100 plus. The 10k BTU unit is perfectly for my 800 sq ft houseThe unit works well but boy is it noisy. I bought it to replace an old LG unit in my apartment living room.

Care Details : Machine wash colors separately wash in cold water, gentle cycle, tumble dry low, low iron.Absolutely IN LOVE with these curtains! We are redoing our eat in kitchen nook and I wanted curtains that weren�t bulky but also weren�t too sheer, these are exactly what I envisioned. I cannot rave about them enough, I want them all over my house! The tabs in the back make them lay great and made it easy to hide ugly brackets on my curtain rod.They definitely aren�t room darkening, but do give privacy and some light filtering.This is a great find for a tab back curtain, which always looks better than a rod pocket. While unlined, these curtains have a linen-like texture, not unlike those I've purchased from Pottery Barn in the past. They provide the right amount of privacy, modest light-filtering, and wrinkles steamed out easily. I am using them on an existing metal curtain rod that hangs above a sliding patio door. To get the right amount of break at the floor but not too much ""puddling,"" I clipped safety pins on each back tab. This gives the curtain more height above the rod and ensures they hang at the desired length.I love these. Perfect thickness and texture. Length is magical (108� against an 8� tall window). Sheerness is not too much but rather just enough. The price was amazing... couldn�t find ANYTHING comparable in stores. Delivery was quick. I need to steam them, but I was eager beaver to get them up. I just love love love. Buy them. I endorse these curtains. ??????I am in love with these curtains! I needed to buy three sets to replace my previous curtains which are now too short because I removed the ring clips that had began to rust after years of use in our humid climate. I was looking for something simple, in a natural material and white color, that didn�t block too much light. These curtains were exactly what I was looking for. They are lightweight, but provide the right amount of brightness and security to my bedroom. The texture is subtle, but still noticeable, especially when closed. The packaging of the three sets were not identical, but the product itself all appeared to be the same. I was aware from previous reviewers that there would be shrinkage, so I bought the next size up (which I needed anyway since my rods were hung higher to accommodate for the ring clips that I would not be using anymore). They did shrink even though I washed in cold water and dried at a low temperature, but I didn�t measure exactly how much. After washing, drying and ironing, their length is slightly longer than where I like my curtains to hang, but I think they look nice. They were easy to iron and hang on the rod. For the price, I feel like these are nice quality, and I am glad I bought them.I looked everywhere for reasonably priced white cloth curtains that would do the trick. Initially purchased 2 panels for the new sliding glass doors and 2 for the window while giving a full effect. I ended up adding four 96� panels in total to this 120 inch in length sliding glass door opening for the volume effect. Now just need the curtains to come back in stock for the windows.Pro's:","Pro's:

If customers have any quality problems during assembly and use, please feel free to contact us. We will reply and solve them soon. Note: The stock of gazebo top replacement is available in our store.I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and sturdiness of the frame. The instructions recommend 2 people but it was easy enough for this senior citizen to assemble solo. The domed top seems to make all the difference as it has not sagged in the rain and we've had some downpours. The shape of the dome seems to also resist lifting in the wind. I've purchased cheaper types of gazebos that didn't survive the summer but this one is by far the most heavy duty. I also thought the legs were ""bent"" but it's actually a neat feature. A bow legged gazebo makes the inside feel more spacious.Bought this after the snow caved in our old one (oops). I was able to put the entire thing together myself (30+ y/o female). I couldn�t tell you how long it took because I was just kinda going at my own pace, enjoying being outside on a nice summer day, taking breaks here and there.There were times I thought I would definitely need a 2nd person, but I figured it out and got everything done myself. Some screws were mislabeled so I had a couple heart attacks thinking I didn�t get the right pieces, but everything was there.We put weighted bags on the corners and it has survived some pretty gnarly wind storms with no issues.10/10 recommended!Honestly, I didn't expect much from this based on the price, but it's been great. I've only had it up for one summer so far but it held up to the elements great, it's surprisingly sturdy for the price and how many pieces it's made out of. My only complaint is that the bug screen at the peak doesn't have any way of attaching to the main cover so it just sort of blows around and doesn't do a good job keeping bugs/debris out of the top.I haven't disassembled it since I bought it, because the yard is still in good shape. I was impatient to open it and check the quality inside. The quality of the shed is really good. Block the sun's rays. I will go ahead and buy a second one.Great outdoor canopy!! The setup instructions was easy to understand and put together, it literary took me and my wife less than two hours to set everything up. The material is also very durable, we had a few rain storms already and had absolutely no issues with it. The design and durability of this product is definitely worth it's money.Pro's:","Pro's:

Replacement Canopy Only. Metal structure and mosquito netting NOT included.. This gazebo was originally sold by Lowes.. Manufacturer's Model Number: S-1210GZ, S-1210GZN. UPF 50+, water resistant, CPAI-84 fire retardantI bought this in June 2019 and it only lasted a year. Every time it rain it leaves puddles of water just laying there make dips in it. It will not go away it just get bad. I had water dips in 8 spotsof the canopy. I had to keep dumping the water out by pulling on it.Will July 23 2020 we had a really bad rain storm I was worried that night. When I woke the next morning it was ripped up in 4 section. And the gazebo was down on the ground with a puddle of water sitting there.I should have listened to the reviews.I purchased this Only 5 months ago. My husband looked at it yesterday & saw that it had a large rip in it on the top! Truly did NOT expect this. My husband always listens to the weather report. If it ever says that we are going to have high winds-He ALWAYS takes the canopy top cover down & then puts it back up when the ""winds/storm"" die down. It's a lot of trouble for him but he knows how much I love to sit out on the covered deck. Before this happened I would have given it 5 stars, but can't now. Would NOT recommend this cover. $ money down the drain!I bought this item as a replacement for a canopy that I have had for several years. It was easy to put on and fit well, but sadly it didn't last more than a few months before being ripped to shreds by a brisk wind. Before it became a tattered mess, we had a thunderstorm come through and two small tears appeared on opposite sides close to where the canopy wrapped downwards on the frame. It was a normal storm and winds could not have topped more than 30mph. The next day the wind picked again and the canopy ripped on all four sides. and there is no way to fix it as the tears are not at the seams, but across the fabric itself. Very bad quality for something you buy at this price.Purchased this replacement canopy in April 2020. It did not even last one season. Picture shows part of the ripped area .... being held together with clamps to get through the season. Unless you use this in an area that is sheltered from the wind, do not waste your money!All in all the replacement roof is good and much better quality of construction than previous ones we have purchased for our gazebo. My only complain was that it doesn't quite fit our frame although we did manage to get it on well enough to keep it. About another half an inch or so on both the 12 foot side and 10 foot side would have been better. Fairly certain that our frame is old enough that the roof probably fits newer frames better so I am still willing to recommend it to others.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Design: Black 11x17 inch picture frame, perfect for your cherished memories; comes with hanging hardware for hassle-free display in both horizontal and vertical formats to hang flat against the wall. Material: Wood frame with lead free tempered shatter-resistant glass that gives a clear view of your picture. Quality: Durable, gallery-style frame; the frame's front has clear glass and a sturdy backboard to keep your photo in place. Use and Display: Perfect for 11x17 inch pictures and legal papers. Protective Packaging: American flat developed exclusive proprietary packaging that helps ensure safe delivery of fragile items; order with confidence, click and add to cart todayStated size is FALSE. Viewable size for image is 12.5 x 18.5 and entire frame is 14.25 x 20.25. You CAN fit a 13 x 19 image into this frame, however you will lose an entire half inch both vertically and horizontally, so this is completely worthless if your image doesn't have any border or you don't mind losing a full inch of your image (measuring diagonally).I get it, lots of frames advertise being slightly larger than they are. I'm an artist, I'm used to that and understand that they usually are saying what size image will fit, not the viewable size. However, I bought this particular frame SPECIFICALLY because one of the images literally shows the measurement of the viewable area as 13 x 19. The image showing this false measurement needs to be edited to show the accurate size.I was hesitant purchasing this particular frame seeing as some other reviews showed their product arrived cracked, but other alternatives were out of the question for their prices so I stuck to my guns with this one. Glad I did!The cardboard backing is easy to remove, and it fit perfectly for my 11x17 art print I measured prior. Doesn't shake around in the frame like I feared. I had this print signed, and it protects it quite well! No visible scratches on the glass. If I buy another one of these frames for other prints, hopefully I have a similar experience.I was searching for a frame on Amazon and came across this frame. It came wrapped up with enough protection.The glass on the frame was a little dirty but that was easily fixed by cleaning it. Besides that there isn't really anything to complain about. The frame arrived in good condition and was shipped fast.I ordered a poster from Vista print and it looks great in this frame it was a perfect fit. I am very happy with my purchase. I will consider this brand in the future when I need order another.Absolutely stunning & very well made! It exceeded my expectations & was even nicer in person than in the picture! It includes both hangers already attached to hang either vertically or horizontally plus the option of wire as well. It's got a nice heft & is definitely much nicer looking than the price alludes to. I'm very impressed. My only qualm, if I had to nitpick, are those little metal tabs that secure the backing. I have found in past experiences that after bending them back & forth a few times, it can cause them to break which will lead to the back needing to be taped as an alternative. While I don't anticipate this to happen to me due to the nature of the use of the frame, it is something to be kept in mind if you frequently change what you display. Otherwise, it's sincerely a terrific, quality frame that is well packaged at an unbeatable price.I could not be more pleased with this frame. I had a matted print I needed to frame, and the outside dimensions of the mat were exactly 11 x 17. It can of course be tricky to order online and be sure you're getting the right size, but I relied on the seller's description as well as the seller's answers to some customer questions. It's exactly what I wanted. Frame itself is very sleek and elegant-looking. The glass is much thicker than you often find in pre-made frames, especially at this price point! The backing board is sturdy, and it will hold quite well the sawtooth hanging bracket. There are actually two brackets, to hang vertically or horizontally, and I like that they are mounted on the board, not on the edge of the frame. They also will bend outward to give a little more space between the picture nail and the frame. The frame also comes with alternate hanging hardware -- clips and wire if you prefer that way. And the protective packaging was great, very carefully designed. Everything about this frame was high-quality.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: ALL-SEASON GAZEBO: Durable structure is made of dark grey powder coated aluminum to withstand harsh weather conditions year-round. GALVANIZED STEEL ROOF: Roof made of grey galvanized steel panels to provide protection from excessive sun and rain. PROTECTION FROM BUGS: The included PVC-coated polyester mosquito netting keeps pests away so you can enjoy your bug-free outdoor space. INCLUDES HARDWARE: Gazebo set includes all necessary hardware for assembly. CERTIFIED FLAME-RESISTANT: Gazebo meets CPAI-84 flame-resistant international safety standardsThe product is a good product however, I received a frame with no top. Contacted Amazon, they wanted to give mea refund of 420.00....LOL I immediately asked for a supervisor, she told me to contact the NSD Delivery and also theManufacturer. Well I did both, NSD said they only received one box to deliver... Not two, Also the box I received clearly says Box 1 of 2. So the Manufacturer said, well this is currently out of stock and there is no top. So I calledAmazon back to speak w a supervisor again, they said return the 250 lb in the original box. and they will refund.I informed the supervisor we had already paid someone to put the frame up and I'm not going to undo, I just need a top to my product I paid 2200.00 for. She said well I cannot help you unless you return the product. Now I'm out 2200.00 cuz I have a Gazebo frame with no top and they have not even had any other suggestions. So after speaking w another supervisor, she informed me that she could have a delivery pick up to come out and disassemble the frame and package it & send back, and that they would refund me the full amount. Well the appointment was yesterday and a delivery person did show up, however they do not disassemble anything, they just pick it up. So we are back to talking to a supervisor again...this has taken several days and hours of my time just trying to get ahold of the right person from Amazon. Nightmare!!!to say the least!First off, I have no idea why some people have ""experts"" that take 2-3 days to put this shelter together. By myself, the first day, I spent 3 hours and had the frame and supports put together. The next morning, I put the start of the roof up with my wife's help. That was the first 1/2 hour. After that, my brother stopped by and we had the entire shelter completed in about 5 hours. That's a total of 8.5 hours. Yes, the instructions aren't the greatest and some steps are a little vague and require some time to figure out what they are trying to say but for the most part are pretty easy to understand.After the full install is complete, this structure is VERY sturdy and looks like it'll hold up for a long time.I'll post an update after the first rain to see how see how waterproof this shelter really is. Some have reported some leakage issues but I'm not seeing right now where I'd get any. It's pretty tight.if you have some skill thos project is no problem. Very little written instruction but the illistrations arent too bad. May need a little trial and error when assembling. Assembled most of it alone. Having a helper makes it go faster but can be done solo if your creative. Once assembled its pretty solid and i expect it to last at least 10 yearsnif not more. Dry desert climate.I love the product so far, it is very striking! I was pleasantly surprised that the mosquito netting was so substantial, although I am not wild about the hooks as they are hard to move along the rails. Also the gutter leaks at the joints.Be prepared, it will darken your home considerably if you are placing never a window for example on a deck. That was disappointing and I had not expected that. Wish I could have purchased a light color. Also the instructions could have been clearer. All pictures without any narrative and orientation guidance. Customer service is a stickler for details regarding replacement of small pieces such as missing nuts/bolts, surprising given the $2,500 I paid.This gazebo is great looking and durable. Took longer than I thought to assemble but only because I was on the corner of a deck. We don't get much harsh weather here but seems like it would hold up. Seems a little too pricey by a couple hundred dollars, but it looks better than others.Pro's:","Pro's:

Furniture and weights NOT INCLUDED. Search B08V8GJL2Q for furniture.I love this gazebo. I wanted to get a jump start for the nice spring and summer weather and purchased this in February. It is sturdy and dry. I have already began to enjoy sitting, dining and relaxing under it, even during the colder days. Two people were able to assemble it and directions were fine. It held up well during our windy days in March. Customer service is also excellent. A few parts arrived damaged (perhaps by FedEx during shipping). The company sent me replacement parts immediately and I had them within a few days. I was amazed by their quick response and they were in constant contact with me. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase.Very nice 12x16 gazebo. Myself and my 12 year old son put it together. Product is great. Shipping by FedEx is horrible. They never update there shipping info. I received 4 packages out of 5. The 5th showed 4 days later even though it was at fedex with the rest.We love our 12x20 gazebo! To be fair, it is difficult to make sense of the instructions, but once you get that figured out it is well worth the hassle. Make sure to have at least 3 people to help you assemble. The gazebo is sturdy and good quality and we will be securing it down to the cement with some anchors just in case. We enjoy the option of the curtains for privacy. The size and space is also a plus. We have our hot tub and some furniture under and they fit just fine. The three loops under the roof are convenient for hanging lights and or fans. If you�re unsure about getting this gazebo, think no more. It is very nice! So glad we purchased this specific one.Edit: I wanted to update my review after getting some rain and snow. The gazebo stood up to both just fine. It is weatherproof and we have not noticed any drips or water leaks under the roof. Extremely happy with the purchase. Would definitely recommend.Very pleased with my purchase of the Purple leaf gazebo. From the start I was contacted by customer service with a message letting me know the 5 tracking numbers for FedEx that was shipping my gazebo. I was impressed the aluminum construction was so light it could be shipped FedEx. It arrived and the quality of construction was very good and solid for being light weight it is very strong and sturdy. The canvas curtains are very thick and heavy, i assume they will stand up to the harsh Arizona sun. The instructions were easy to follow, they were almost all pictures, few words and good labels on every panel and part and screw. My wife and I assembled it over 3 evenings, probably 8 hours total. The company checked in with me to make sure everything arrived, answered any questions I had, I was confident if there were an issue they would address it immediately.Great lookingTook a while to put togetherComes with extra screws and parts which is a great ideaShipping was fast and each piece was wrapped in a foam wrappingHave only two complaints directions need to be better and more completeWish there was a cover on the bottom of the legs to cover mounting screwsAll in all a great productPro's:","Pro's:

Text: One 12 count box of Pure Protein Chocolate Peanut Caramel Protein Bars. These protein snack bars offer delicious chocolate, peanut, and caramel flavors in every bar. Enjoy a gluten free protein bar pre workout, post workout, or on the go. Low sugar (1) protein bars each contain 20 grams of protein, 2 grams of sugar, and 190 calories. Instructions: Adults, for best results drink 8 fl. ounces of water or other liquid with this bar. These 20g protein bars provide high-quality protein, an essential part of a nutritious, balanced dietI have a genuine sweet tooth, and my favorite taste? Chocolate. This was fine while I was younger, and my metabolism would work off the extra sugar. However, I'm now in my 40's, I'm not as active, and I have a job and hobbies that keep me at my desk a majority of my day. That said... my sweet tooth has not gone away. My son joined the Army and they needed low sugar, high protein bars.. that's pretty much all we could send them. This bar was one of the items we tried, and I fell in love with them... basically it's a candy bar that gives me protein, and less than 2g of sugar... perfect. I now buy these 4 boxes at a time, and they have been great to substitute a meal (when I'm not as hungry) or afternoon snack. In addition, I have generally eaten these before going to play a sport (softball is most common)... it allows me to eat, so my stomach has something in it, but it's also light enough to not 'weigh me down' or cause me to 'drag' as I hustle in the game. I 100% support and promote these to family and friends - they have proven to be a great product for me... I hope they work as well, or better for you.I love these! Alot of low calorie protein rich bars are hard, dry, cardboard-esque- not these! They taste unhealthy(meaning delicious!) They pack alot of protein punch for the calories and I always keep them in my purse and backpack(nursing school!) Just in case hunger strikes at an inconvenient time! Love them! Also, I've accidently left them in the car(melting issue) and after returning to normal temperatures they were still great to eat, I'm not saying you should do that on purpose but I'm saying they are a snack or impromptu meal you can count on being there for you when you need it. Can't say enough good about them.These chocolate Peanut Caramel bars are the BEST flavor and best tasting for protein bars. I've bought this brand and flavor for years (yes, since the yellow packaging) and the formula/taste has consistently remained good. It's worth it to order it online in a value pack because (1) it's cheaper and (2) they are that good you would want a lot of them LOL. However, I definitely wouldn't order these bars in the hot/summer months since they arrived melted. Yes, you can refrigerate but this does contain dairy (meaning might be spoiled ??). If it is a colder/cool month, I would definitely reorder. I hope this review helps :)I used a doctor directed plan to lose my 45#, but then needed to get back to a ""normal"" routine to maintain. Since a working person often does not have time to plan healthy fresh meals for the work day and I wanted to stay on my high protein, low carb, 5 small meal per day meal plan, this fit the bill. I have 2 egg-white fried in ovacodo oil on guacamole 1/2 slice sour dough toast and side of fruit for breakfast, a pure protein bar at 10a and 3p and a green sld or cup of broth base veg/protein soup at lunch and then my lean and green for dinner. I do not get hungry or crave unhealthy carbs. This maintains my weight as well as my muscle mass. I do get 8k steps and light weight lifting in daily. And I can still treat myself to a dessert once a week. I'm 64 years young, 5'1"" and 130#. This works for me!! I've done this for 3 years.I have these on a subscription. I have low blood sugar and carry these for a quick protein boost. I've tried about 10 flavors and multiple brands and these are the best. My only problem is even Amazon runs out and I can't always get them on time. But they are like a sweet treat full of protein not sugar or carbs. It's a treasure for your mouth and is healthy too.

This is it Bar also has lots of fiber if you are into that. I had occasion to deal with their customer service department and they promptly took care of the issue I had. Hat's off to No-Cow. Highly recommended and I'll buy again.So I know, with a pessimistic title like that I must be a two or one star review. Not at all. For what these are, they are five stars. And what they are is a pretty fair tasting appetite killer. They each have 20 grams of protein and 17 grams of fiber. I eat one of these with my afternoon tea, and sometimes never even think about dinner.They are made with vegetable protein. And veggy protein is gritty. They smooth it out some using glycerin (rather than oil). This keeps the calories down. I highly recommend eating them with a warm liquid like tea or coffee, as it brings out the flavor of the bits of peanut and or chocolate, and makes the texture smoother.So, if your priority is: vegan, high protein, weight loss, high fiber - you will likely be happy. If your hope is that a bar with this much vegan protein and fiber will taste like a candy bar�.move on. ??I HATE not being able to eat foods with dairy products. However, since I found NO COW, I no longer have the pain in my gut from Whey.. I workout a lot and like having a protein bar to take on the run. Thanks !The purchase says LOW CARBS , it is NOT low carbs. Its 26 grams of carbs per bar. I looked up this item under a low carb keto search in Amazon, even the email the company sent me asked me how I liked it, and also mentioned that it was low carb. For a keto diet, 20 grams of carb is the daily allowance. These bars are 26 grams of carbs each. That is NOT low carb. This is not keto friendly either - too many carbs past the daily allowance. I couldn't eat them.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Direct replacement. Ready to use , no assembly required. MERV 11 high eficiency filter. Removes air polutants and allergens. Included is a Dakota Supplies date of installation stickerFits. Works. No problem w seller or delivery. A bit pricey but good quality. Gotta be careful nowadays w your measurements. A 2 x 4 is not a 2 x 4 anymore, so it goes w many measured items these days. Pay attention to the numbers you need. Bought a pricey 5 pack of filters that weren�t as advertised or right size. Actual measurements can sometimes be different from those advertised. Big run around to try and replace / refund. So measure twice and check theirs to be sure you�re getting the correct filter. A quick click can make for a giant hassle sometimes.I was getting desperate to find this filter. I noted the other filter needed an assembly and I did not want to take a chance on having a filter collapse on me and REALLY wanted to get the original FILTER that my HVAC technician installed with my NEW UNIT. I was delighted to find out that THIS filter is EXACTLY the same one when I took out the ""OLD/ORIGINAL"" filter! LITERALLY the same size, make, build, and the ""font"" on the box is the same!!! IT's a clone!It's working great! Easy to put in and the fit is EXACT! THANK GOD! Gonna order me another one or two!I like the fact that I ordered the product and receive it promptly, and it is the right size.This product is required for our clean air system in our home. It is exactly what we need to have and is accurately described on the website.First replacement on our new A/C unit and looked at getting the QuickBox (assembly required) version. After reading reviews I decided to look further and found this. Filter was shipped in a big box, sturdy and rigid constructed no tabs or reinforcement needed. Fit perfect into our handler. Will definitely reordering again.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: SPECIALLY DESIGNED: Super low profile design fits jack under vehicles as low as 2-3/4"". VERSATILE: Wide lift range of 2-3/4 inches to 15-1/4 inches; no need for additional jack stands with safety bar in place; fits many modified and stock passenger vehicles. SAFE: Locking safety bar supports lifted load at maximum height. EASY TO USE: Ball bearing swivel casters for easy maneuvering. DURABLE: Meets or exceeds ASME standardsAdmittedly, I was hesitant about buying this after reading so many bad reviews. I received it a few days ago and am very much pleased with it. I change my own tires--from Winter to Summer tires (and vice-versa) on my wife's car and mine. I have a low-slung Subaru WRX and the low-profile of this jack easily fit underneath the jack points. I almost lost the bolt that holds the handle to the jack--so please remember to look for it in the box. It holds the lift handle in place making maneuvering the jack quite easy. There's also a nice carry handle built onto the end. I like the rubber saddle as it seems to be made for the new-style jack points before and aft of the front & back tires. It was easy to raise the car with just a few pumps. I'm completely satisfied. It does everything the description says it does. Would buy again.Unfortunately there is no option to get in contact with the seller through my options listed. Tried going through Amazon support and said the product wasn't returnable.I have used this jack a total of 5 times since I got it in may. The jack is already leaking and doesn't hold a load for my Mazda 3. I want a replacement hoping that I just got a bad seed but sense I can this is my only option.I don't not suggest this jack to anyone. It was a big waste of money. And can't seem to get it back.Would be willing to change my review with a replacementSo far so good. VERY low profile. Still have two finger clearance when rolling the jack under the car, even with puck in place. Very large pad to fit my puck with room to spare. Five full pumps and the tire is 3+ inches off the ground and at the first safety bar hole.Only negative is the lowering. Very abrupt.I really like this jack because it allows me to rotate my tires on my Tesla Model 3 with just it and no other jacks or stands. The Model 3 has a very stiff chassis and you can lift up one side of the car with just this jack, lock it safely with the round bar, and rotate tires front to back. I like that the saddle has a rubber pad glued into it to reduce the risk of damage to the car (although I use a vehicle specific jack pad for my Model 3). Only thing I works change is to make the handle return spring stiffer so that the handle stays up by itself.This jack performed better than any jack I have ever owned... The low profile was perfect for my needs and the lift height is surprising for the design... I would absolutely recommend this product for people who own lower to the ground vehicles...Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Modern style; satin black with smooth laminate wrap finish. Each frame includes: clear acrylic facing, rigid cardboard backing and wire hanging hardware kit (some assembly required). Each frame holds a 17 by 22 inch photo/print/poster (viewable area reduced by .25"" on each side due to frame lip). Frame moulding is 1 inch wide; solid MDF construction. Frame is designed for WALL HANGING only (hanging hardware allows for portrait or landscape orientation)I had found some wonderful posters and simply needed the frame to hang them. Perusing through other listing I found most 24x36 frames to be alarmingly expensive, but the cheaper ones did not look fit to weather the test of time. Enter these frames.Best value for you moneyThe frames are beautiful and the packaging is exquisite ensuring they arrive undamaged. Mounting my poster was a breeze, and then adding the hardware and hanging the poster was even easier. Next time I need frames I'm coming right back here.Usually after I toil and labor over a 1000 piece puzzle of special difficulty (like a ""photomosaic""), I glue it up on a board to not only eventually display it, but because I do not want to endure that ordeal again with that particular puzzle. Something that represents that much time and effort needs a smart frame to put it in. One that is not only the 20x27 size of the puzzle but has options for hanging landscape or portrait mode. AND will not cost me more than the puzzle itself.Enter the Craig Frame Essential. Nice looking, solid frame with a protected acrylic shield (removable film on both sides). I bought a two pack for two difficult Disney puzzles that I had glued onto poster board. They fit perfectly and look fantastic. Would definitely recommend their two-pack for 1000 piece puzzles that are usually about 20x27.The delivery was quick. Packaging excellent, workmanship, and measurement spot on. Had to trim one puzzle by 3/8"" (expected) and all three pictured are a huge success!!!Having a frame to finish off the total look to present their gift means everything. I am an avid puzzler. I see a puzzle think of the receiver and put it ? together. I have a large family and many grandchildren, nieces, nephews, that all covet, and cherish their gifts. Knowing that every piece was lovingly placed just for them.I suggest when your ready to order, that you only order your frames independently of any other items in your shopping cart. This insures your items are specifically packaged, and boxed to your frames if that makes any sense. N this case I ordered and received these three frames in the same order. I've ordered both ways and definately have found that placing my frame order by itself. My product arrives in its best shape possible.Do not purchase these frames. First of all these frames are not the frames in the picture advertised. These are extremely thin rectangular frames the ones in the picture are wider and rounded. Cardboard is the backing for your pictures. I paid over 60 dollars for two of these cheap frames. I paid fifty dollars to much. I repeat don�t waist your hard earned money on these cheap frames.Got this because it seemed like the best deal for the money, and it turned out to be true. They also look great. A quick note on the packaging... This shipped via FedEx and got pretty smashed up in transit, which worried me initially, but the packaging was more than adequate. The outer box is mostly empty air, with a smaller box/cardboard frame inside to act as a bumper around the frames, which were also packed back to back, preventing them from scratching each other in visible places. Overall very pleased. Need to get at least one more, so I'll be placing a second order soon.Pro's:","Pro's:

Text: Made of solid wood. Wide, square seat. 2 sets of four crossbars for stability. Crossbars provide 2 heights as footrests. Assembly requiredThey were a little difficult to put together, only because we thought the holes didn't line up exact. You just need to make sure you have the correct sides going the correct way. My 16 years old daughter put two of them together in about hour. Once assembled, they looked great. Love the larger-square seating.This stool is great. Very heavy feel to it. Some reviews I saw before buying claimed it was awkward putting together; it just took some strikes in the right places during the final steps which ends with a solid stool. Would definitely recommend and buy again.Pretty decent stool at a very good price. Easy enough to assemble after taking two minutes to review the parts. Expected it to be wobbly at this price point but was pleasantly surprised that it was very secure seating. Recommended.I only gave sturdiness 4 of 5 because my husband put all his eight on one of the rungs. I don�t thing most people would ever have this issue.

The color is more of a beige than cream. Easy to put together and feels sturdy. Only reason I dropped one star is since one chair was missing a floor guard. We contacted the seller and immediately had a response and piece sent in mail. Very pleasedUpdated- they sent more than the peice they sent a new chair! So extra impressed on the customer service.

They were very easy to assemble as well, it took about 40 min to put them both together by myself.

This Atlantic piece is 23.5�. I had to stand at the curb and stuff important things into checked bag and my medical equipment into my large purse (thank goodness I brought the biggest I had). Very inconvenient, had to send some shoes and clothes back home in the not- carryon with my daughter. Really upset me as I really need an overhead carryon for meds and medical devices.I did not know 5ere was a 30day time limit to return things to Amazon. They are now charging me an $11 restocking fee!I bought this suitcase for my 82 year old mother, who was packing to come live with me, and had never owned her own suitcase. She was charmed by the pretty teal/royal blue design, and especially loved the spinner wheels that roll easily in any direction. This is the perfect medium sized suitcase (NOT carryon size). It has a telescoping tubular handle and two fabric side handles, multiple zipper pockets, it�s lightweight, and most importantly the zippers are good quality (no breaking open and spilling your contents). It worked perfectly on her trip, and I�m pleased with my purchase.Great value, this piece...really pleased with everything about it. Will order another one soon.GraciasThis was my favorite luggage item; the colors and pattern are really cute and distinctive; easy to find your bag on the luggage carousel, and completely my style. Which is why I'm sad to report that after a few months of use, the retractable handle completely stopped working. It's now basically useless to me because I can't conveniently roll the suitcase any more.

QUICK-DRY: Fabric quickly wicks away sweat from your body, keeping you dry, cool, and comfortable all day long. Perfect for any activity.First off, let me speak to my order experience. This is a SINGLE pair of underwear. For a price point above $10, I was expecting a multi-pack of this underwear.For quality sake, it's very good. I'm happy with the form, fit, and feel.Here's my forecast to future buyers of this underwear: once someone buys this underwear at the above $10 price point, I expect their next purchase to be directed to companies such as JOCKEY or other high quality undergarment manufacturers. The 32degree is definitely comfortable, but it doesn't compare favorably with the high-end undergarment options in the marketplace.I think the proper price-point for a single pair of new-age fabric underwear would best fit in the $8 range, not $12.-Super soft and breathable material-Great length and offer plenty of room so you don�t feel cramped-Material molds to your bodyAmazing pair of briefs. Once you buy these, go ahead and buy the 32 degree cool 2 pack shirts as well, this company has the most comfortable clothes I�ve ever felt. I�m currently trying to replace my whole wardrobe with their stuff. I literally tell as many people as I can about this company, because I love their stuff so much and I want them to be around forever. Just go ahead and get them, you won�t regret it! And you�ll probably end up wanting everything they make, like me??I used to buy under armor underwear of similar design/material but I found the 32degrees at Costco and bought a pair. They fit even better than UA and feel lighter, more breathable.... and are much cheaper. I�ve since purchased an entire wardrobe of the stuff from amazon.Not terrible, but far from great. The waist and legs are sized appropriately, but the 'crotch' is too tight and the fly design is baffling--the overlapping layers of fabric overlap much more than necessary, and again, it does not offer comfort for your groin.Not a fan of these boxer briefs. The fit was off right away. They rode up my legs, and wouldn't stay down. Not comfortable at all. Tried washing then re wearing. Still nope. These have been tossed. I couldn't even wear them to sleep. Save your money. Just get the originals, the brand that cost more, but works. The initials are UA. So much for saving a few bucks...Pro's:","Pro's:

Security: Meets CPAI-84 flammability requirements. Heavy duty carry bag with compression straps and ID label to personalize your tent.I love this tent! It is literally the nicest tent I have ever seen in person. I recognized the quality workmanship right away. I bought this tent to replace the crappy new Coleman tent I bought and returned immediately. All of the seams on the rainfly are perfectly taped. I love how the rain fly goes on all the way to the ground, and the roll-up windows and vents on the rain fly are wonderful. This is the first tent I have seen that has 2 doors - how cool.It is definitely 100% waterproof. Took it to San Diego and it rained on us really hard on the 2nd night of our trip, and there was flooding at our campground. I added some pictures to illustrate the amount of rain we got. The inside of the tent was 100% dry, and we were all very comfortable. There was so much water on the ground that the floor of the tent felt like walking on a water bed, but not one leak inside the tent. I was amazed. Everyone that has seen the tent is impressed. The ventilation is superb, better than any tent I have used. It is easy to put together, and fits in the storage bag with no problem. It is huge! There was room for 3 big cots and a queen sized air bed, with some room to spare. I can walk upright from one end to the other with lots of room over my head (I am only 5'7"", though). One great thing about this tent is that you can put the rain fly on, then roll it back and tie it down; enjoy sleeping under the stars with the enormous screened windows, and if a rogue rain storm should happen to roll in in the middle of the night, no worries - just get out and unroll the rain fly. I can't say enough great things about this tent. I love everything about it. I think if I ever need another tent, I will get another NTK.Camped every day for a month across over 7 campsites in a variety of conditions including 40mph winds, 33*F temperatures, high and low elevations, rain, blistering sun, and more. Camped in gravel, grass, moss, pine needles, tundra, and sand. Housed two adults and two children under the age of 10. INCREDIBLE TENT!!! Never leaked. The rain fly design was so versatile as to allow a multitude of different configurations depending on the weather and degree of privacy desired. Have used several tent brands before including Colman and this one has them all beat. The only advice that I would give is to buy real tent stakes. The metal ones that come with are perfectly fine for backyard camping, but for remote outdoorsy kind of adventures you'd be better off with some thicker, longer, more solid stakes.When I was considering buying the tent on Amazon, I was confused about how the rain fly worked. It ties onto the tent poles at various positions and has a double door design that free-floats on top of the inner tent piece. The fly doors also roll up if desired which is super nice. The inner room divider divides the inside into two, unevenly sized partitions which was also nice so that we could put the kids and their stuff in one end and the adults in the other end. Absolutely no fantasy of real privacy but sometimes just having a wall between you and another human being is enough. Also, when it got down to 33*F, we all moved into the smaller partition side to conserve warmth. Worked great.All that tenting (30ish days!) and the tent shows no sign of wear. Incredible tent people.I purchased the Arizona 9 to 10 person tent to replace a Wenzel Columbia 4 person tent that tore after about 5 years of occasional use. There are great reviews of this tent and photos so I will skip a lot of details and get to the heart of if I would recommend to friends and family.* This is a heavy tent. I have low back arthritis so my back is sensitive to weight. This tent feels much heavier than 26 pounds. I later purchased an REI Kingdom 8 which is also heavy but almost half the weight. Lifting the Arizona tent is very heavy. My adult family became quickly frustrated trying to help set up the tent. There were no detailed instructions and the tent setup was not intuitive. Add the weight and the wind causing the tent to lift and fly like a kite added to the low back pain. If friends and family are willing to help set up the tent in windy cold weather, then yes, I recommend this tent for friends and family.* It is possible for one person to set up this tent but lay the rainfly on top and secure it before raising the tent or have a tall ladder because getting the rainfly on top once the tent is erected is a struggle. I had to remove a pole and partially collapse the tent to get the rainfly on top. I highly recommend setting up the tent first before taking it into the field for camping. The X crossing poles in the center tended to tip over. The pin rings helped keep the poles in place and I was thankful for those.* Waterproof was tested with a water hose and there were no leaks. I still recommend spraying a water repellent over the outside of the tent.* The bottom is like a bathtub. The plastic material is like a heavy tarp and crunches loudly when walking inside the tent. I recommend using a plastic outdoor carpet to muffle the sound. When turning over in a sleeping bag on a quiet night it�s - loud crunching sound - or get some earplugs.* The interior space is enormous - the size of a New York apartment or small camper. I recommend buying a good quality water repellent tarp to go under the tent floor. Look at the height of the tent and length then buy tarp and poles that will provide shade for the tent. In my area of the country, limbs break from trees so it�s not safe to put a tent under a tree. My area also has high summer temperatures so a tarp over the top of the tent will provide extra shade.* Buy a bigger carry bag for the tent. I was unable to get the entire tent into the bag because the plastic tub does not roll or fold well.* Other reviews will give more details and photos. No instructions clearly explained how to set up the tent so print out the photos younsee on the product description page.* Because of its weight, I would not buy this tent as a personal tent for me but it�s a great tent for people who can manage the weight. For the price, it�s a great buy for the features and space you get. It�s a great value but set it up in advance of your trip. The Amazon page has photos of how the set up looks but when the box arrived the my home, there were only photos on the box that described its features but not how to set up the tent. I included a photo of a very important setup feature - use the ribbon to tie the two cross X poles together before you raise the tent. This 9-10 person tent is very tall and once you raise the tent you can�t reach the top to tie the poles together. Even with a ladder we had to partially collapse the tent. There are no step by step instructions and the setup is not intuitive. I have owned several tents and this tent is not intuitive, but once you set it up it makes sense. But extra tie out cord and stakes for the type of soil or you will be upon. When at the beach I use snow stakes. Stakes down well - this tent did not fly away in a sudden wind and rain. Do not throw away the ribbons or anything in the box until you are positive the tent is set up properly.

Bought to have some shelter and warmth when socially distancing. I�m very pleased with the stability of this. It�s NOT a pop up so it�s very sturdy and has so far held up to rains and snows (I make sure to knock the snow off the roof ASAP so it doesn�t get too heavy - we�ll see how well the top holds up). I don�t have a fenced in yard so I was afraid this could �walk away� but you�d really have to disassemble it to move it out of the yard. It has so far kept the water and snow to a minimum and the patio heater has SO FAR not damaged the roof (I believe due to the vent at the top). I have a infrared thermometer and constantly monitor the temp of the roof when running the heater (which DOES have the recommended 18� clearance above the heater - in the center at least). It gets up to about 100-140* TOPS around the lower areas around the edges of the heater and so far I haven�t noticed any issues with shrinkage/burning.Two things I noticed literally right out of the box: it was very well packaged, and the welded ends of the supports didn�t have a lot of welding. Sure enough, literally 15 mins. into assembly, the first side bars I joined and lifted up, the welding broke. I didn�t drop it, didn�t put stress on it, it simply broke from its own weight. Such poor craftsmanship. I was disappointed I had to lug it to The UPS store alone, and, I kid you not, there was another one at UPS being returned. I was refunded promptly but overall very disappointed. Please do not buy this product.This is a beautiful canopy, I enjoyed it for all of a 1/2 day (5 stars) - My issue is with the Customer Service - zero starts. I purchased it in March 2021 but did not put it up until the July 5th. We spend about 4 hours getting it up on a Monday and unfortunately a sever storm hit my area on Tuesday, (who knew NJ could receive such serve weather in July, we had a new record for damages). The Gazebo tumble over, rolled over to the next yard and was damaged. Two of the rods were broken (see pics) and two poles were bent. I have tried to contact ABCCANOPY by e-mail just to ask if I can PURCHASE replacement parts (they do not have a number, just an e-mail) I sent e-mails but NO REPLY. The Gazebo is so nice (I didn't even get to take a pic of it standing) I was thinking just to order another one in a different color so I can change colors summer to summer - BUT, I don't like spending money with companies I cannot receive an answer from. This was no one's fault but really, no customer service? I could have lived with the answer NO, we do not have replacement parts but I'm very uncomfortable with NO REPLY.I love that the color was a true navy blue, I didn�t like that some of the tack welds were done really bad. I had the wind blow before my sandbags came in and it fell and bent one of the poles, shouldn�t be a hard fix since it was one of the bad welds that broke. Definitely setup after you get the sandbags and fill them with small rock. I have had the wind blow since and this thing doesn�t move.Pro's:","Pro's:

I went to my local Michael�s store for a frame and they had a very limited selection considering half the store is for pictures and frames. I got a $40 frame and the hanging clips broke immediately after hanging on the wall. I returned that one and found this one on Amazon for half the price. The rustic blue color also happened to be perfect for the picture I was using and the room it was going to be in. The mounting brackets felt sturdy and don�t seem like they will fall off the wall any time soon. Really glad I found this brand, the picture frames are pretty good quality without breaking the bank! Excellent buy!Great frame for the price, glass is plexi and comes with sticker on both sides to keep from scratching during shipping which was awesome. Was also surprised to see it was real wood which looks and feels rustic with the deep grains. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and was perfect for our Badlands print.I was looking for a frame for a cloth painting I purchased in Tanzania. The painting was a odd size, so I crossed my fingers and ordered. This frame comes with two different sized matts and the smaller one was perfect for this painting. The frame is well-made, it came in protective packaging and arrived quickly. What more could I ask for?I had a 9x10 piece of art and couldn't find any frames that would fit. This frame was so cute, perfect and fit well with the mats. I ended up using the 6x8 mat with the picture (again, art was 9x10 and frame was 9x12) and it looks adorable.This frame came well packaged. I really liked that it included 2 size mats in 2 colors, white and cream. It was a perfect fit for my need. The quality is great for the reasonable price. Very happy with my choice!Pro's:","Pro's:
