Mississippi map turtles don't grow quite as large as some other species like sliders and cooters, but they still do require a relatively large and deep aquarium habitat.</p><h3>What is a map turtle?</h3><p>Map turtles include 14 species of turtles in the genus with patterns on their shells that look similar to the tall contour lines of an elevation map. These species are named inhabit the banks of much of the Mississippi River and its southern tributaries.</p><p>These super skittish turtles need the opportunity to flee to deep water whenever they're scared. Because these turtles require pristine water quality and startle easily, even captive-bred animals often become ill from stress alone. These are best left as ""look only"" turtles; caring for them will be comprised of aquarium maintenance steps like lighting, water changes, and a focus on filtration and water flow. For these reasons, the Mississippi map turtle needs a very experienced keeper and is not suitable for children.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Mississippi map turtle</p><p>Adult Size: Females grow to 10 inches; males grow to 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30+ years</p><h2>Mississippi Map Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>A Mississippi map on dry land feels sort of like a fish out of water. They feel so at home in the water that they don't stray far from any body of water so that they can always dart back into it to make an escape.</p><p>Mississippi maps are friendly in a community of turtles, although females will tend to be dominant as they grow twice as big as males. When keeping multiples, limit the number of females that are kept together.</p><p>These nervous and shy turtles do not appreciate being handled too much and doing so will deny the animal its safe place: the water. With strong jaws made to crush river snails and crustaceans, these animals offer a strong bite, so keep your fingers safely away from the head.</p><h2>Housing the Mississippi Map Turtle </h2><p>Of all of the pet aquatic turtle species, these are the turtles that most like a strong current from a large filter or even a powerhead; they like deep water too. Originating in large flowing rivers, they are strong swimmers who feel right at home in mildly turbulent water flow.</p><p>Full-grown map turtles need plenty of swimming space, but typically a 75-gallon fish tank will do well for one male turtle; females need about a 125-gallon tank. Gravel built up with some larger rocks to create a beach on one side of the tank serves well as a basking area and dry-docking station for your turtle. A variety of floating accessories for the turtle's use as raft haul-outs are available at pet stores.</p><p>Water quality is very important to animals that spend the majority of their lives submerged, and dirty water can cause a number of infections. Quality filters are a must for any Mississippi map turtle enclosure to keep the water clean, clear, and free of odors. Submersible filters like the Cascade internal filter and canister filters are your best options for creating very clear water. They should be constantly running to not only provide filtration but also aeration.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Mississippi map turtles don't need extremely warm temperatures but will be more active and have a better appetite if they are kept around 85 degrees F. If temperatures are allowed to drop below the 60s your turtle may become lethargic, not eat well, and start to go into hibernation. Turtles that are housed outside in warmer months should be brought inside to a warmer environment when the outside temperature gets too cold, so they don't go into hibernation.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Map turtles that are housed outside do not need supplemental UVB lights since they receive natural UVB rays from the sun. When housed indoors, however, full-spectrum UVA/UVB lighting and supplemental heat lights are absolutely necessary. UVB lighting should be provided for 12 hours each day and year-round in the form of a special reptile UVB bulb. Also, this bulb should be replaced every six months since the invisible UVB rays expire before the visible white light does.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Map turtles are omnivores that eat their food while swimming. Aquatic turtle pellets are a good staple diet for map turtles, but they should also get some fresh, leafy vegetables or plants. Dark, leafy greens like romaine, dandelion greens, and fresh parsley should be placed in the water on a regular basis or clipped to the side of the tank with a suction cup clip sold in the fish department. Fresh, chopped apple pieces and freeze-dried shrimp can be offered as treats but should not make up a large percentage of your turtle's diet.</p><p>For the meat portion of their diet, map turtles also eat some insects, crustaceans, and fish. Fatty fish like goldfish should be avoided; select larger, higher protein food items. The majority of their diet should be plant-based from the formulated turtle pellets and the fresh greens.</p><p>In order to prevent captive, non-foraging turtles from becoming obese, the amount to feed should be whatever they will eat in under six minutes. If using this schedule, feed your Mississippi map turtle no more than three days per week. If feeding daily, only give what they will eat in under two to three minutes; feed in the morning or afternoon, matching the times when they are typically most active.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Map turtles are relatively easy to care for with the proper setup and diet. But they can run into some health issues.Intestinal parasites are found naturally in most reptiles, including pet map turtles, but they can become a problem if they overpopulate the intestinal tract. Therefore, annual fecal parasite exams should be performed by your exotics and reptile vet. Appropriate deworming regimes can help.</p><p>If water quality is a problem, your turtle can get skin, shell, and ear infections from the dirty water. If too much algae builds up on your turtle's shell or skin, use a soft toothbrush to help keep it clean. Ear infections are easily recognized as large bumps behind your turtle's eye. They will need to be cleaned out by your vet, and your turtle will most likely be placed on antibiotics.</p><p>Your turtle's beak and nails should be maintained at a good length and may need periodic trimming if they are unable to grind them down by themselves in their environment. Sometimes there is an underlying health issue that is causing the excessive growth.</p><p>Without proper UVB lighting and calcium from the turtle pellets, map turtles are likely to develop metabolic bone disease and shell deformities. If you suspect your turtle has a health issue, bring it to the vet as soon as possible.</p><h2>Choosing Your Mississippi Map Turtle </h2><p>Mississippi map turtles should have no signs of flaking or unusual bumps on both the front and back shell. Their eyes should be clear, and their skin should not show any signs of irritation or infection.Whenever possible, arrangeto watch the animal eat before taking it on as your pet, just to ensure that it has a healthy appetite.</p><p>Your best bet is to get your turtle from a reputable breeder rather than capturing one in the wild and trying to bring it home. A breeder can tell you the turtle's history and health background; with a wild turtle, however, it may be harboring some hitchhiking parasites.</p>",1260
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mud-turtles-1238354,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Mud Turtle Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Mud Turtle Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>0</p><p>Native to ponds in the Eastern United States from Texas to New York, Eastern mud turtles are popular as pets largely because oftheir small size. Rarely growing to be over five inches long, mud turtles are aquatic turtles that are small and compact.Their care requirements are similar to other aquatic turtles, but unlike some of their relatives, they are semi-terrestrial.</p><p>Unlike many other reptiles, and especially aquatic turtles, mud turtles hardly ever bask. They spend most of their time walking, buried under leaves, or settling on the bottoms of shallow ponds rather than trying to soak up the sun. While they may be well-suited for older children who can properly care for them, mud turtles are probably not a safe pet for a younger child.Since they need both land and water habitats, their keeper must have an intermediate level of skill in tank and terrarium construction.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Mud turtle, Eastern mud turtle</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 50 years</p><h2>Mud Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These little turtles look quite cute, but don't assume that they'll be docile and friendly. Mud turtles are on the grouchy side and will bite with their curved beaks if they feel provoked or nervous. This is one of several reasons to avoid picking up or touching a pet mud turtle unless it's absolutely necessary.</p><p>Some people become concerned if they smell a foul odorall of a sudden coming from their mud turtle. Mud turtles are closely related to musk turtles and, like these relatives, mud turtles can secrete an awful-smelling liquid to scare off predators. Most mud turtles raised in captivity will never use this defense mechanism, but owners should know that mud turtles do have this capability to produce a musky odor.</p><h2>Housing the Mud Turtle </h2><p>Despite their small adult size, these turtles need adequate room to swim and dive when kept indoors in an aquatic terrarium. Provide at least a 40-gallon fish tank that has a land half and a water half. This allows your turtle to swim and dive but also room to roam around and burrow on dry land. Make sure the water depth is equal to twice their length. For a female turtle, it's a good idea to get a 50-100-gallon tank.</p><p>Using gravel on the bottom of the water half of the tank will keep it cleaner than using a muddy bottom, and a floating dock may be a welcome addition. However, for the land portion, consider adding a second tank, placed on its side, atop the rim of the water tank to create a double-decker habitat. With this kind of setup, create a safe, centrally located ramp between the upper and lower level so your turtle can safely access both levels without tumbling out of the enclosure and onto the floor. Make sure the substrate you use is large so your turtle doesn't swallow the mud turtle.</p><p>Mud turtles are so named because they like to burrow in mud when they hibernate, but you don't have to have a muddy enclosure just because you have a mud turtle. Encouraging your turtle to hibernate is not recommended in captivity, so it's not necessary to provide mud, despite the turtle's name. Wet leaves and loam are sufficient for the turtle to bury itself in the dry portion of the terrarium.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Ensure that all parts of the habitat do not get too cold. Turtles of all kinds require heat lights as well as UVB lights. Meant to keep your mud turtle warm, large heat lights warm the entire enclosures that mud turtles use. Traditional reptile heat bulbs and a separate UVB bulb should be utilized to preventthe enclosure, which should be at a water temperature of 74-78 degrees Fahrenheit. Ambient tank temperature should be between 78 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB lights help the turtle produce Vitamin D3 so that their digestive system can properly absorb calcium. The UVB bulb should stay on for a 12-hour cycle and be replaced every six months. Even if it doesn't burn out, its ability to make invisible UVB rays will run out before the visible portion of the bulb burns out.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Mud turtles are omnivores, but the majority of their diet consists of worms, fish, snails, and other foods typically found in ponds. Offer one protein meal until satiation every other day. Turtle pellets are a nice addition to their captive diet.</p><p>Also, feed whatever volume they will eat of the dark green, leafy vegetables like fresh parsley and dandelion greens; other salad greens (not iceberg or romaine lettuce) should also be offered fresh daily. Provide calcium supplements daily for hatchlings and three times a week for adults. Food should be provided several times during the week. In addition, feed one protein meal a day (can be insects, snails, worms, or small fish).</p><p>Although it's not ideal to handle mud turtles frequently, some owners create a separate sub-enclosure (like a clear, floating plastic box) for feeding their pets, since mud turtles are exceptionally messy eaters. If you don't want to move them to a feeding area, just be aware that you may need some cleanup time after feeding.</p><p>Although mud turtles are not exceptionally strong swimmers, they do spend much of their time in the water. Use a submersible or canister filter to help keep the water in your turtle's tank fresh and aerated as they need clean water to prevent infections and illnesses. Use more than one filter to keep water clean and clean the rocks in the tank every two weeks with diluted bleach and run water over them to rinse off the bleach before placing it back in the enclosure.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>It's always helpful to bring your turtle in for an annual checkup with an exotic pet veterinarian. The most obvious health problem with any aquatic turtle is poor shell health. Dirty water, incorrect lighting, and an inappropriate diet can lead to flaking shells, shell deformities, and even shell rot.</p><p>Other diseases that are easily reversed include ear infections, vitamin deficiencies, metabolic bone disease, and intestinal parasites. Again, improving your turtle's water quality, overhead lighting, and diet should suffice. Have a fecal sample from your mud turtle checked yearly for intestinal parasites; these can usually be expelled with the appropriate deworming treatment.</p><p>If you intend a mud turtle to be a pet for a child, be aware of the connection between aquatic turtles and Turtles are cute and children naturally want to pick them up and play with them, but since they may harbor , turtles can pose a health risk to anyone who handles them. Children are thought to be most at risk since they're less likely to wash their hands after touching an aquatic turtle.</p><h2>Choosing Your Mud Turtle </h2><p>Mud turtles should have smooth shells with no signs of flaking or unusual bumps. Their eyes should be clear, and their skin should not show any signs of irritation or infection.</p><p>Your best bet is to get your mud turtle from a reputable breeder; do your research before you make your selection.</p>",1214
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/red-eared-sliders-p2-1238386,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Red-Eared Slider Turtle: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Red-Eared Slider Turtle: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Red-eared slider turtles can be rewarding pets. They sport attractive yellow and green markings on their shells and skin, along with distinctive red patches behind their eyes, and they often are quite sociable with their owners. However, they are a fairly substantial undertaking when it comes to their care.</p><h3>What is a red-eared slider?</h3><p>Red-eared sliders are a type of turtle native to North America. Known for their distinctive red markings and quick ability to ""slide"" into their native ponds, these active swimmers are commonly kept as pets.</p><p>Those cute little turtle hatchlings you see for sale will grow into large, long-lived, and somewhat messy aquatic turtles. Be prepared for how much space and cleaning they will need. Like most other reptiles, the red-eared slider is a poikilotherm that cannot regulate its own temperature, so it's important for these pets' owners to provide the proper conditions with heat lamps to ensure their well-being.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Red-eared slider turtle, red-eared slider, red-eared terrapin,red-eared turtle,slider turtle,water slider turtle</p><p>Adult Size:Around 12 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30 years</p><h2>Red-Eared Slider Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Red-eared slider turtles are active pets that enjoy swimming and diving. Captive-born red-eared sliders tend to be friendlier and more outgoing than those born in the wild. In fact, wild turtles are likely to disappear into their shells or underwater when they hear or see anything (or anyone) approaching, while captive-bred sliders might actually swim up to you expecting a treat. Avoid purchasing wild turtles that make it into the pet trade, as the stress of the lifestyle change for them can result in serious health problems and even premature death.</p><p>While it's possible to find a red-eared slider that's eager to interact with you when you pick it up, it's more likely that your pet will feel nervous and either disappear into its shell or nip. In general, it's best to respect your turtle's space and simply watch it rather than handling it.</p><h2>Housing the Red-Eared Slider Turtle </h2><p>Setting up appropriate housing for a red-eared slider turtle is not cheap, so be prepared to spend a couple hundred dollars on a proper habitat. No matter what a pet store sales associate claims, your hatchling turtle will not thrive in a small plastic container. Get an aquarium, even for the smallest of hatchlings. Start with a 10-gallon tank if you must (though a 20-gallon tank is better), but be aware that your turtle will grow and need a larger tank pretty quickly.</p><p>In addition, you will need to provide full-spectrum UV lighting, a basking heat light, and a drydocking area. The docking area should include an easily accessible ramp out of the water and a stable area where the turtle can bask in the light to absorb heat and UV rays.</p><p>Furthermore, red-eared sliders can be pretty messy because they both eat and produce waste in their aquatic home. For optimal cleanliness, install a tank filter that is rated for two to three times the amount of water you have in your tank. Canister filters and submersible filters are both used for aquatic turtles. If you don't have a filter, you will need to do weekly partial water changes and water quality testing, something that is both time-consuming and messy. But if you allow the water to stay dirty, your turtle can develop various health issues.</p><p>Some red-eared slider turtlescan live year-round in an outdoor pond in warm climates. However, creating a healthy pond environment and protecting your turtle from predators, cold spells, and pesticides must all be taken into consideration.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Turtles' health can suffer if they are not warm enough, so it's important to provide an environment between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The turtle's basking dock should be between 85 and 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a water thermometer to keep an eye on water temperature. If it falls too low, add a basking light or other heating device.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Full-spectrum UV lighting is necessary over your turtle's aquarium to mimic the benefits the turtle would get from natural sunlight. Leave the light on for 10 to 12 hours per day.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material used on the bottom of your turtle's aquarium. Not only does it have an aesthetic factor, often mimicking the animal's natural environment, but it also can give your animal something to burrow into. You can leave the bottom of your tank bare if you wish to make cleaning the water easier. But if you want to use a substrate, pick gravel or rocks that are too large for the turtle to ingest to line the tank bottom.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Red-eared sliders eat both animal protein and vegetables, including leafy greens, dried shrimp, krill, and crickets. It's fine to feed your pet a commercial brand of turtle food, most of which are specifically formulated for complete nutrition. Follow your veterinarian's recommendations on feeding to maintain a healthy weight for your turtle's size. There is no need to provide water beyond what's in the aquarium.</p><p>Many owners opt tofeed their red-eared sliders in a container of water outside their regular tank. In addition to proper filtration, this practice can help keep the water clean.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Turtles and many other animals, such as hedgehogs, often carry salmonella and other pathogens that can spread to humans. This shouldn't necessarily stop you from getting a turtle (unless perhaps you have young children or immunocompromised people in your house), but you should be aware of the risks and take proper hygiene precautions. Washing your hands before and after touching your turtle or its habitat is key.</p><p>Moreover, watch out for gastrointestinal parasites in your red-eared slider. Symptoms include poor appetite and abnormal feces. These turtles also are prone to respiratory infections, especially if their habitat is too cold. Some signs of an infection are open-mouth breathing, sneezing, and excess mucus. Plus, like many turtles and tortoises, they might come down with shell rot or ulcers. This often occurs due to an unsanitary habitat or improper diet and shows up as abnormal or foul-smelling patches on their shell.</p><p>As for behavior, these turtles are generally friendly once they get comfortable in their environment. However, if you must handle them, do so slowly and gently to limit their stress and minimize the potential for aggressive behavior, such as biting.</p><h2>Choosing Your Red-Eared Slider Turtle </h2><p>Red-eared sliders are widely available at pet stores, though it's best to look for a turtle at a reputable breeder or rescue group that can give you comprehensive information on the animal's history and health. The average price for a red-eared slider in pet stores is around $20, but a quality breeder will likely charge a little more.</p><p>Choose a turtle that is active and alert, and make sure it is eating. Look for any red flags, such as lethargy, abnormal feces, shell discoloration, swelling, or excess mucus.Also, note the environment in which the turtles are kept at the pet store, breeder, or rescue. If the water isn't clean or the temperature is too cool, there's a chance the turtles will have health issues.</p>",1201
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/yellow-bellied-sliders-1238384,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Yellow-Bellied Slider: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Yellow-Bellied Slider: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>One of the most popular pet turtles, yellow-bellied sliders, are long-lived aquatic turtlessome live up to 40 years in captivity. These turtles spend most of their time in the water, but unlike amphibians, they need to be able to get out of the water to dry off and rest.</p><p>As far as turtles go, this species is moderately easy to care for. In general, aquatic turtles require a lot of tank maintenance. Closely related to red-eared sliders, these turtles will also need a giant tank as adults. These popular pets are distinguishedby their shells, which are brown or black with yellow stripes. Their underbelly or lower shell is yellow with black spots, hence its name.This turtle's native range is the southeastern U.S. from Florida to Virginia.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Yellow-bellied slider, yellow-bellied terrapin</p><p>Adult Size: Males can grow up to 9 inches long; females can grow up to 13 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy:30 to 40 years</p><h2>Yellow-Bellied Slider Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The slider is adiurnal turtle, meaning it is most active during the day. They tend to eat first thing in the morning, and in the wild will spend most of the rest of the day basking in the sun. Captive yellow-bellied sliders also are most active during the day.</p><p>Like most turtles, yellow-belliedsliders do not like handling; this can cause undue stress for them. Over time, you might be able to get them accustomed to handling, but when they feel threatened, they will bite.</p><p>These curious, amiable reptiles are entertaining pets if cared for properly. They will never be cuddly pets like a dog or cat, but yellow-bellied sliders tend to have unique personalities that endear them to their owners.</p><h2>Housing the Yellow-Bellied Slider </h2><p>Aquariums are good for young sliders, but as these turtlesmature, their size makes housing them a bit more challenging. The ideal tank size for an adult slider is 75 to 100 gallons. Provide a basking dock and clean water for your turtle housed indoors.</p><p>These turtles eat and leave fecal matter in their aquatic home. You will need to install a tank filter rated for two to three times the amount of water you have in your tank. You can use canister filters or submersible biological filters. If you don't have a filter, you will need to do weekly partial water changes and water quality testing, something that is both time-consuming and messy. If the water remains dirty, your turtle can develop various health issues.</p><p>Treat water with a water conditioner before using it. The water conditioner will remove chlorine and other harsh water additives that can disturb your biological filter and your pet's quality of life.</p><p>If you have an outdoor pond and a securely fenced yard to keep your turtle in and predators out, you might consider putting it outdoors for at least part of the year.</p><p>Enterprising owners also make roomy habitats for sliders by using pre-formed plastic pond liners to make indoor ponds. All turtles kept indoors will need special lighting.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Turtles need adequate UVA and UVB rays. They typically get these UV rays from unfiltered sunlight or a special lamp. Aquatic turtles will need these UV lights year-round for about 12 hours per day. Replace UV light bulbs every six months. If your yellow-bellied slider lives outdoors, it will not need supplemental UV lighting; the sun's rays will be sufficient.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>As cold-blooded creatures, turtles need to self-regulate their body temperature. To control their temperature, turtles seek out basking spots to soak up the sun's warm rays. If you have an indoor tank, you will need to replicate a sunny basking spot that can reach about 88 degrees Fahrenheit. Either a 60-watt or 100-watt basking bulb should be sufficient. As turtles also need the UV rays from the sun for proper development, you can get a combinationmercury vapor bulb, which provides both heat and UV.</p><p>Their water also needs to be at a constant temperature of 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Awater heaterwill be required to keep the water warm. It should be maintained day and night.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Yellow-bellied sliders are omnivorouscreatures. Turtles of all ages should get a wide variety of both animal and plant-based items. Juveniles and hatchlings should eat twice a day, and their diet should lean towards carnivorous. Once a turtle reaches adulthood (age 2 to 5), its diet should consist of mostly vegetables.</p><p>Commercial turtle pellets are a proper base diet when supplemented with a variety of other items. Offer only what your turtle can consume in about 15 minutes and remove uneaten food.</p><p>Dark, leafy greens like romaine, dandelion greens, and fresh parsley should be a regular part of your yellow-belliedslider's diet. Offer chopped apple pieces and freeze-dried shrimp occasionally.</p><p>Most aquatic turtles eat the occasional insect or fish, but avoid giving them fatty fish, and never give them high-protein meats. An aquatic turtle'sdiet should be mainly plant-based.</p><p>Feeding your turtle outside of its home is a bit more work at feeding time, but it will make keeping the tank clean a lot easier in the long run.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Sliders should be able to dive into their water. A turtle that is always floating can be a sign of a problem, such as pneumonia. Turtles with eyes that are closed or puffy may indicate a respiratory infection or a similar issue. Wheezing and drooling also are signs of respiratory ailments.</p><p>Shells that are soft, not smooth, or covered in algae might have shell rot, which is a painful condition caused by fungus.</p><p>Metabolic bone diseaseand vitamin deficiencies are also common issues that affect aquatic turtles in captivity due to inappropriate diets and lighting. Make sure your UVB and heat lights are changed regularly to help keep your turtle healthy. Metabolic bone disease is particularly painful for turtles and can be life-threatening if not treated properly.</p><p>If you notice any signs of illness, consult with an exotics veterinarian who specializes in reptile care. Most of these conditions are treatable if caught early.</p><h2>Choosing Your Yellow-Bellied Slider </h2><p>Before you bring home your yellow-bellied slider, there are a few things to look out for to ensure it's healthy. Make sure the turtle's eyes are not sealed shut, and they should not be puffy or have discharge.</p><p>If its shell has any soft or rough spots, this is another bad sign; it could indicate shell rot. Test its responsiveness by making sure it pulls its head and legs into its shell or tries to swim away when you attempt to pick it up. Most turtles and tortoises don't like handling; this is normal, expected behavior.</p><p>Your best source for buying a yellow-bellied slider is a reputable breeder who has documented its health and history. A captive-bred, not wild-caught slider, is the best option.You can expect to pay $10 to $20 for a hatchling. Adult specimens can cost upwards of $60 to $100. These higher prices reflect the amount of care that has gone into bringing the turtle to adulthood.</p>",1180
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/african-side-neck-turtles-1238351,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>African Sideneck Turtle: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>African Sideneck Turtle: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Aquatic turtles are fun to watch, especially when they're as unique looking as the African sideneck turtle. These turtles got their common name because they're unable to tuck their heads entirely inside their shells, so they tuck them to the side instead. Sidenecks are on the larger side as far as turtles go, and they can live for several decades.Their shell is often a dark brown, and their skin ranges from olive to brown with black markings on the top of their head. They have large, round eyes and a mouth that looks like it's fixed into a permanent smile.Sidenecks have moderate care needs but can be suitable for beginners if you're willing to put in the work.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:African sideneck turtle, African side-necked turtle, African helmeted turtle, marsh terrapin, crocodile turtle</p><p>Adult Size:7 to 12 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 25 to 50 years (or more)</p><h2>African Sideneck Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>African sidenecks have longer necks than most other species of turtles. This gives them a distinct advantage over their fellow turtles: If they find themselves turned upside-down, these turtles can right themselves using their neck muscles. Other turtles are often helpless when turned on their shells.</p><p>You can socialize pet aquatic turtles with frequent interaction, and African sidenecks are no exception. They might be a little shy at first, but once they're comfortable, they're typically inquisitive, active turtles that can be interesting to watch.</p><p>However, like other aquatic turtles, these animals aren't for handling. They're stressed very easily, and they might bite when provoked. Plus, they might carry salmonella bacteria, so it's important to wash your hands after handling anything in their environment. And it's probably best to keep them away from small children due to the risk of infection.</p><h2>Housing the African Sideneck Turtle </h2><p>Your turtle should be able to swim and dive in its aquarium, so the larger it is, the better. Ideally, you should have at least a 75-gallon aquarium that is half to three-quarters full ofwater. Also, provide a dry land area using a floating dock or large rocks, so your turtle can climb out of the water to dry off. Use a secure metal meshscreen lid to keep your turtle safe, especially if you have other pets.</p><p>Moreover, invest in a quality water filter. Aquatic turtles defecate in the water, and without a filter, you'll have to do weekly water changes. Some people prefer canister filters while others like the smaller submersible filters. For a large tank, a quality canister filter is typically your best option.</p><p>In addition to keeping the water clean, you should dechlorinate the water by either letting it sit out for 24 hours before adding it to the tank or by adding a dechlorinating solution. A recommended pH of 6.5 (a fairly neutral pH) should be maintained and can be easily checked with watertest strips from the pet store.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>African sidenecks require supplemental heat from a heat lamp to maintain their body temperature. Heat lamps vary in wattage and should maintain an ambient temperature of around 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a basking temperature of around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature should never drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, even at night when the basking light gets turned off.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>African sidenecks also need UVB lighting to properly metabolize calcium. Keep a UVB-emitting lamp on the tank for around 12 hours per day to maintain a normal day-night cycle. These lights typically need to be around 10 to 12 inches away from where your turtle sits outside of the water, and the bulbs usually need to be replaced every six to nine months. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on your specific bulb. Lack of appropriate UVB lighting can result in metabolic bone diseases.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your turtle's aquarium. It can help to mimic the look and feel of the animal's natural environment. A substrate isn't essential, and it will collect food and waste, requiring regular cleaning. But if you wish to use a substrate, many owners opt for sand or large pebbles. Anything larger than sand but small enough for a turtle to eat is dangerous.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Like most aquatic turtles, Africansidenecks are omnivores. They eat some plant material, as well as insects, fish, crustaceans, and aquatic turtle pellets. Turtle pellets should include the calcium and other vitamins and minerals that your turtle needs. Meat (such as chicken or beef) should never be fed to your aquatic turtle.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Aquatic turtles are often afflicted with parasites. These are tricky to treat because the turtle might not show obvious symptoms. Parasitic infections are usually discovered during an exam by a reptile veterinarian.</p><p>African sideneck turtles also are prone to vitamin A deficiency. Signs of this can include swelling and pus around the eyes.</p><p>Plus, like most reptiles, African sideneck turtles are predisposed to respiratory infections. You might notice your turtle wheezing if it has a respiratory infection, along with excess mucus around its nasal passages and mouth.</p><p>All of these conditions should be treated by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. Don't try to treat a sick turtle with a home remedy before checking with your vet first.</p><h2>Choosing Your African SideneckTurtle </h2><p>Visit a reputable breeder or rescue organization to acquire an African sideneck turtle. The seller should be able to tell you about the turtle's origin and health. Young turtles often cost between $50 and $100. When selecting your turtle, look for any signs of illness, such as flakiness on the shell, difficulty breathing, lethargy, or a lack of appetite.</p><h2>Similar Species to the African Sideneck Turtle </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your new pet.</p><p>Pet Turtles: Cute But Commonly Contaminated with Salmonella.</p>",968

Because they are vulnerable to predators due to their lack of a shell, softshell turtles can be aggressive. It's not a good idea to house pairs of them together because they'll likely attack each other. They have sharp claws and strong jaws that can do serious damage. Likewise, these turtles generally don't like being handled and aren't timid about attacking a person if they feel threatened.</p><p>Furthermore, don't plan to have a softshell turtle as a pet in a home with a small child due to their aggressive nature. Plus, curious dogs, cats, and other pets can do serious damage to a softshell turtle and also might be injured in the process.</p><p>Female softshell turtles get to be much larger than the males, so owners must be prepared to find them a sufficiently large enclosure. That large enclosure also requires a moderate amount of care to keep it clean and properly heated, so this isn't a low-maintenance pet.</p><h2>Housing the Softshell Turtle </h2><p>The kind of softshell turtle you choose will determine the size of tank you need. For instance, the Florida softshell turtle can weigh over 40 pounds and reach over 2 feet long, requiring a large area to swim. At roughly half that size, the spiny and smooth softshell turtles are more manageable as pets. They can be kept in a large aquarium that's at least 75 to 100 gallons.</p><p>The water must be kept very clean, and there should be nothing sharp or rough that could cause a wound on your softshell turtle in that tank. Canister filters, submersible filters, and other efficient filtration systems should be utilized to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. Moreover, provide driftwood or a floating island to allow your turtle to leave the water and bask when necessary. And include live aquatic plants if possible.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Most softshells do well in enclosures that are kept at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Water heaters designed for fish, as well as reptile heat lights, can be utilized to maintain an optimal temperature. A basking lamp around 90 degrees Fahrenheit is usually ideal.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB lighting is recommended in addition to heat lights to allow the turtle to metabolize calcium. These lights should be kept on for around 10 to 12 hours per day to mimic a natural day-night cycle, and they should not be blocked by any glass or plastic. The bulbs typically should be changed every six to nine months, following the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>In the wild, softshell turtles love to bury themselves in the sand and mud. Provide clean play sand at the bottom of their tank to encourage this natural behavior. Don't use harsh substrates, such as gravel, which can hurt the turtle's fragile body.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Softshell turtles eat a variety of insects, amphibians, eggs, and fish in the wild. In captivity, they are also primarily carnivores but will adapt to eating floating turtle pellets. Fish, gut-loaded crickets (crickets fed nutritious foods that then pass to your pet), worms, and other readily available prey items are typically offered to pet softshell turtles.</p><p>Larger softshell turtles will even eat pinky mice and small amphibians, such as frogs. You should always place the food in the water and let your turtle eat without having to get out of its pool. In general, feed adults once daily as much as they can consume in 15 minutes. But check with your veterinarian about the quantity and timing of the feedings for your turtle's age and size. They do not need a separate water dish.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>In the wild, softshell turtles are a favorite meal for alligators. And even in captivity, these turtles are much more vulnerable to injury than other pet turtles because they lack a hard shell. Wounds and consequent infections are common in softshell turtles, along with ear infections and intestinal parasites.</p><p>Annual checkups with a veterinarian who specializes in exotic pets are recommended. Opt for a fecal exam to check for parasites, which can wreak havoc on a turtle's immune system and overall health. Along with routine vet care, proper tank setup and water quality are key to keeping a healthy softshell turtle.</p><h2>Choosing Your Softshell Turtle </h2><p>Because of their complex care needs, softshell turtles usually aren't recommended for beginners. If you think a softshell turtle is a good fit for you, get your turtle from a reputable breeder or rescue organization that can provide information on its origin and health. Expect to pay between $50 and $150 on average.</p><p>Look for a turtle that is alert, moves quickly, and does not appear lethargic. (Remember, these animals move faster than many other turtle species.) Any scaliness or cuts on the turtle's shell might indicate a turtle that has suffered an injury, which could mean it has other less obvious health issues as well. Moreover, its eyes should be clear and free of any mucus or crustiness.</p>",895
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/red-eared-sliders-1238387,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Red-Eared Slider: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Red-Eared Slider: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Red-eared sliders are very popular aquatic turtles that require special lighting, an animal and plant based diet, and continuous cleaning and maintenance. Red-eared sliders are a serious commitment because they can live up to 20 years in captivity and needs proper upkeeping to stay happy and healthy. If you get one of these quarter-sized babies, it may look easy at first, but as they grow, they will need a bigger tank and a lot of constant care.</p><p>Take a look at what you need before acquiring a turtle and your new pet slider will be sure to thank you.</p><h2>About Red-Eared Sliders</h2><p>Red-eared sliders require more work than many people think. They also get much larger and need more room than is often implied by pet stores and other vendors. A large tank, special reptile lighting, and an appropriate diet are just a few things you'll want to make sure you provide to your red-eared slider.</p><h2>Choosing a Healthy Red-Eared Slider</h2><p>Before you bring home a red-eared slider, there are a few things to check out to increase the odds that you are bringing home a healthy turtle. Learn where to get a red-eared slider (including possibly rescuing one) and how to tell whether or not your turtle of choice is healthy.</p><p>Look at its eyes, shell, how it swims, and whether or not it seems very active. There are some key indicators to help you determine whether or not a red-eared slider is healthy.</p><h2>Housing Your Red-Eared Slider</h2><p>Small aquariums are good for young turtles but as red-eared sliders mature they will require a tank that can hold well over 100 gallons of water. Creative turtle owners use all sorts of novel housing ideas to meet the roomy requirements of their red-eared sliders using things like pre-formed plastic pond liners to make homes more like indoor ponds. And, if you have an outdoor pond, and a securely fenced yard to keep your turtle in and predators out, you might consider putting your turtle outdoors for at least part of the year.</p><p>Water quality must be maintained no matter where you house your turtle and both supplemental heat and UVB lighting should be provided. Setting all of this up is the hardest part but once your tank or pond is established the maintenance isn't all that bad.</p><h2>Feeding Your Red-Eared Slider</h2><p>Although red-eared sliders' tastes tend to change as they mature, (shifting to a more herbivorous diet as they get older) turtles of all ages should be offered a wide variety of both animal and plant based items. Commercial turtle pellets can make up a good base for the diet but they should be supplemented with a variety of other items.</p><p>There are a few basic things you can do to ensure easy cleanup and a healthy turtle. Feeding your turtle outside of its home is a bit more work for you at feeding time but it will make it easier to keep the tank clean and the overall water quality good in the long run (which is best for your turtle to avoid ear infections, shell problems, etc.). Also, avoid overfeeding your turtle to prevent obesity and excessive waste matter.</p><h2>Red-Eared Slider Behavior </h2><p>Whether it is making sure red-eared sliders are free to perform behaviors that are necessary for their well-being (such as basking and swimming) or just trying to figure out what your turtle is doing, understanding normal red-eared slider behavior can help you provide optimal care for your turtle. Claw fluttering and a resistance to basking outside of the water are just two behaviors that may mean your turtle is trying to tell you something.</p><h2>Red-Eared Slider Health </h2><p>Improper environmental conditions anddiet are among the most common culprits when it comes to health problems in red-eared sliders. Diseases such as metabolic bone disease (MBD) and vitamin A deficiency are seen in many kinds of reptiles including red-eared sliders.</p><h2>Sexing Red-Eared Sliders and Reproduction </h2><p>Red-eared sliders are not easy to sex until they reach sexual maturity. Adult male turtles will have a long tail and long front claws while adult female turtles will have short front claws and short tails.</p><p>Some people don't find out they have a female untilshe starts laying eggs (females will lay infertile eggs without a male present). Casual breeding of red-eared sliders isn't recommended but it is important to provide a nesting area for egg-laying females. Although they will drop them in the water, this is not a red-eared slider's preferred way to lay eggs. Some females will retain their eggs rather than dropping them in water if they do not have a nest and will become egg bound (a serious problem).</p><h2>Red-Eared Sliders and Salmonella</h2><p>Every so often, you will hear from the media about the risks of salmonella from pet turtles (and sometimes the warnings sound scary). However, the risks of salmonella from pet turtles is nothing new and can be managed quite easily. Many kinds of pets (including all reptiles, amphibians, hedgehogs, and more) carry salmonella and most people should have little reason to worry about contracting the bacteria. A simple hand washing is all it takes to drastically reduce your risk of getting infected.</p>",863
7,https://www.thesprucepets.com/gulf-coast-box-turtle-1238468,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Gulf Coast Box Turtle: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Gulf Coast Box Turtle: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Native to areas along the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf Coast box turtles are the largest subspecies of the common box turtle. They have a large, domed upper shell that's typically dark brown or black with yellow stripes or blotches. They're not aquatic turtles, but they do love to be around water. In the wild, they're often found in marshes and swamps. As pets, these turtles have complex housing and dietary needs, so some turtle experience is ideal before acquiring one.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Gulf Coast box turtle</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 8 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 to 40 years in captivity; up to 100 years in the wild</p><h2>Gulf Coast Box Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Gulf Coast box turtles usually aren't suitable pets for young children or for new pet owners. This is due to their complex care requirements, as well as their susceptibility to stress, which can greatly impact their health. Gulf Coast box turtles are generally shy and don't like to be handled. They need plenty of places to hide to feel comfortable in their environment. However, once they've acclimated to their space, many pet turtles will learn to recognize their keepers and even beg for food.</p><h2>Housing the Gulf Coast Box Turtle </h2><p>While it is possible to keep Gulf Coast box turtles (especially hatchlings and juveniles) in a large indoor terrarium with a heat source, they do much better in outdoor pens where the climate is agreeable. Most experts recommend a minimum of 4 feet by 8 feet for a box turtle's pen, especially if you have multiple turtles or it's a full-time home. A smaller pen will suffice if space is limited, but avoid going below 4 feet by 4 feet. A cramped space can stress a turtle. The enclosure should be in a sunny location, though it should always have a shady spot.</p><p>Moreover, most box turtles are burrowers, so make your pen escape-proof with walls buried deep into the ground. Paving stones placed on the ground around the perimeter can help to discourage digging. It's best to build the enclosure out of solid material; if the turtle doesn't see what's outside its cage, it's less likely to try to climb or burrow out to get there.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>If you're keeping your Gulf Coast box turtle indoors, a terrarium with a heat lamp is the way to go. They prefer temperatures between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit with a basking spot that's around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Nighttime temperatures should not drop below 70 degrees.Do not use a heat rock, as it can cause burns.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Gulf Coast box turtles need UVB lighting either from natural sunlight or a UVB lamp to metabolize calcium in their diets. Without it, they can develop metabolic bone disease and even die. When housed indoors, turn off the lamp at night to mimic a natural day-night cycle.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Because this species lives near water, it likes a high humidity level of around 60% to 90%. Maintain this through misting your turtle's enclosure daily.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material used to line the bottom of your turtle's enclosure. Not only can it mimic the animal's natural environment, but it also can help to maintain the humidity level and satisfy the turtle's burrowing instinct. Thus, substrate that retains some moisture is ideal for Gulf Coast box turtles. Many owners opt for chemical-free topsoil, leaves, and moss. Layer it at least 4 inches deep to allow your turtle to burrow.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Gulf Coast box turtles are omnivores and need a varied diet. As adults, their diet should be around 40 percent vegetables, fruits, and grasses, with the rest made up of low-fat protein sources, such as earthworms, slugs, snails, mealworms, crickets, grasshoppers, and small fish. Hatchlings and juvenile turtles are more carnivorous than adult turtles, so bear in mind your turtle's age when preparing its meals.</p><p>It's particularly important to make sure your Gulf Coast box turtle gets the right calcium and phosphorous balance in its diet to prevent metabolic bone disease. Dark leafy greens, such as parsley, dandelion greens, spinach, and collard greens, all are good vegetable options. Blueberries, grapes, apples, and papaya are good fruit choices.</p><p>Fresh prey insects from pet stores and bait shops are the best protein sources for a box turtle. Avoid feeding a captive Gulf Coast box turtle insects caught outside because you have no way of measuring pesticide exposure. Commercial box turtle diets are available, but they're typically only fed as supplements within a varied diet.</p><p>In general, feed your turtle every two to three days. But consult with your veterinarian about the proper quantity and timing of meals based on your turtle's age, size, and health. You also should provide an easily accessible shallow pan of clean water at all times. The turtle will use this for drinking and soaking, so be sure to change the water regularly.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>In addition to metabolic bone disease, which can lead to weakened bones and death, Gulf Coast box turtles are prone to respiratory infections. These infections are usually caused by insufficient humidity, with symptoms including wheezing and mucus around the mouth and nasal passages. If your turtle experiences frequent respiratory infections, it could be a sign of vitamin A deficiency.</p><p>Parasitic infections are another common ailment seen in turtles. They don't always show symptoms, but they can be diagnosed by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. And like most turtles, box turtles are susceptible to a painful condition known as shell rot, which is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. The shell will appear cracked or dry, and it might emit an unpleasant odor.</p><p>If your turtle is showing symptoms of any of these illnesses, don't try to treat them without consulting with your vet.</p><h2>Choosing Your Gulf Coast Box Turtle </h2><p>Gulf Coast box turtles aren't hardy animals and thus aren't suitable for beginner turtle keepers. They have very specific needs, are sensitive to stress, and are difficult to keep in captivity.</p><p>When acquiring a Gulf Coast box turtle, select a captive-bred specimen from a reputable breeder, or visit a rescue organization. This way, you avoid supporting the capture of wild turtles for the pet trade, which often results in subpar care and sick animals.Expect to pay between $100 and $400 on average. Make sure the turtle has clear eyes and no mucus around its nose or mouth. Also, its shell should feel solid, and it shouldn't have any bumps or swelling along its body.</p>",1107

Theyhave a domed upper shell that's brown with yellow lines in what's sometimes described as a starburst pattern. Their skin is dark gray with white or yellow spots, and there's sometimes green on a mature male's head. Ornate box turtles are one of the most popular turtle species to keep as pets. Thus, they're typically easy to find at breeders and rescue organizations. They have somewhat complex housing and dietary needs. Under the right conditions, they can live for several decades.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Ornate box turtle</p><p>Adult Size: 5 to 7 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy:40 to 60 years</p><h2>Ornate Box Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Most box turtles aren't good pet options for children because they can be shy and not take well to excessive handling. But ornate box turtles are a bit perkier and more personable than their box turtle cousins. Varieties of ornate box turtles bred in captivity tend to be easier to handle than their wild-caught counterparts. Plus, wild-caught turtles don't typically thrive in captivity and often die from the stress.</p><p>When you bring your ornate box turtle home for the first time, be sure to give it time to get comfortable in its surroundings before handling it. Box turtles have been known to bite when they feel threatened. But once they feel comfortable, most ornate box turtles are quite active and enjoy exploring their environment.</p><p>As with other North American box turtles, ornate box turtles in the wild hibernate in cold weather, especially those that live farther north. In captivity, this usually manifests as burrowing.</p><h2>Housing the Ornate Box Turtle </h2><p>Ornate box turtles do best inoutdoor enclosures and often develop health issues when kept solely indoors. They need a large enclosure with room to move around and a high fence to keep them from climbing to escape. (They may be slow, but they do love to climb.) Also, provide several hiding places, such as logs or planks, in your turtle's enclosure. And use a thick layer of loose peaty soil or leaf litter for your turtle to burrow. Plus, include a shallow pan of water for soaking and drinking.</p><p>Ensure that there are both shady and sunny areas in the enclosure, so your turtle can spend time basking but have a place to cool off.If kept indoors, a large enclosure should be built with sufficient heating and lighting.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Ornate box turtles prefer temperatures around 80 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit at night. Make sure shade is available at all points during the day, especially during the warmer months. A heat lamp can provide supplemental heat for cooler days or indoor enclosures. Do not use a heat rock, as this can lead to burns.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Ornate box turtles need UVB lighting to metabolize calcium. If kept outside, natural sunlight meets this requirement. But indoors they'll need a UVB lamp for their enclosure.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Ornate box turtles like a humidity level of around 40% to 50%. In the wild, theycreate a humid microenvironment for themselves by burrowing in moist soil, so it is essential to provide them with a substrate layer at a minimum of 4 inches deep in their enclosure. Regular misting of the enclosure is recommended.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>A common substrate, the material that lines the bottom of your turtle's enclosure, is peat-based soil (make sure it's free of chemicals) mixed with sphagnum moss.Leaf litter also can be used. The substrate helps to mimic the animal's natural environment, as well as maintain the enclosure's humidity level. Plus, turtles like to burrow in their substrate. So if your turtle is on the larger side, provide a substrate layer that's at least 4 inches deep for it to satisfy its burrowing instincts.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Ornate box turtles are omnivores and require a varied diet. Calcium-dusted crickets, mealworms, waxworms,and earthworms, along with pinky mice, should be regular parts of the ornate box turtle's diet. Grasses, dark leafy greens, and certain vegetables and fruits can also be given. Some turtles are nervous about eating in the open, so feed them in a sheltered area. It's also ideal to place the food on a plate, paver, or other flat surface, so they don't accidentally ingest their substrate.</p><p>Some turtles tend to be messy eaters, so owners will feed them in a separate enclosure from where they spend most of their time. You'll have to weigh whether your turtle will tolerate the amount of handling required for special feeding accommodations. In general, feedings should occur every day for young turtles and every other day for adults. Consult your veterinarian for the quantity and variety of food that's best for your individual turtle.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Like most turtles, ornate box turtles are susceptible to vitamin A deficiency, respiratory infections,and parasites.</p><p>Respiratory infections usually show symptoms, such as wheezing and excess mucus around the nostrils and mouth. Repeated respiratory infections, coupled with weight loss or disorientation, can signal a vitamin A deficiency. Thisis usually the result of a nutrient-poor diet. Many varieties of leafy greens, such asiceberg lettuce, don't have enough nutritional value for turtles, so they should not be a significant part of their regular diet.</p><p>Box turtles also are prone to shell rot, which is caused by either a bacterial or fungal infection. It sometimes shows up after the turtle has suffered a shell injury, such as a cut or burn. The shell will appear cracked or dry, and there will be an odor of decay if shell rot sets in.</p><p>Parasitic infections usually require a fecalexam by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. If caught early, these conditions are all treatable. Don't try to use home remedies before you've consulted your vet.</p><h2>Choosing Your Ornate Box Turtle </h2><p>Ornate box turtles aren't hardy and thus aren't suitable for beginner turtle owners.

The casque is present in both males and females and aids in steering water that falls onto their heads into their mouths. Veiled chameleons have bodies that are banded in shades of green, yellow, and brown whichadjust to varying shades.</p><p>Names:Veiled chameleon (,Yemen chameleon</p><p>Lifespan: Approximately 6 to 8years in captivity</p><p>Size:Veiled chameleon males can reach 18 to 24 inches in total length (about 12 inches snout to vent length plus their tail), while females tend to be quite a bit smaller at 10 to 13 inches (just 4 to 6 inches in snout to vent length plus their tail).</p><h2>Veiled Chameleon Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Veiled chameleons are territorial and aggressive to other chameleons so they should always be housed individually. While they are usually quite docile towards people, regular handling tends to be stressful for them. They are pets better suited to being watched rather than handled.</p><p>These chameleons are not good pets for small children, or for novice lizard owners.</p><h2>Housing Veiled Chameleons </h2><p>Chameleons should never be kept in a glass terrarium or aquarium. They need the ventilation that a mesh enclosure provides. Fine metal or fiberglass mesh is not recommended but PVC-coated hardware cloth is good.</p><p>Vertical space is essential and a cage size of 36 inches by 24 inches by 36 to 48 inches tall is recommended (the bigger and taller the better). Chameleons like to climb high up off the ground to the height is of utmost importance. An outdoor cage can be used when the weather is warm enough, as long as overheating is prevented.</p><p>Cleanliness in the cage is vitalto preventing bacterial or mold growth. Using paper towels or newspaper to line the cage makes cleaning easy and a reptile dirt mixture can be placed on top. Do not use wood chips or any other substrate that could be accidentally ingested and cause blockages.</p><p>Provide lots of sturdy non-toxic plants and branches. Ficus trees have often been used in chameleon housingbut theyrequire some caution as the sap can be irritating.</p><p>Other plants you could try include pothos, hibiscus, and dracaena. Artificial plants and artificial vines may also be added. A varying selection of branches should be provided, making sure there are secure perches at different levels and temperatures within the cage for your chameleon to climb on.</p><h2>Heating and Lighting </h2><p>For veiled chameleons, a daytime temperature of about 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit should be provided along with a basking spot at 85 to 95 degrees. As long as your home doesn't drop below 65 to 70 degrees at night, heating at night isn't necessary.</p><p>Heating is best accomplished by using a basking or incandescent light in a reflector or a ceramic heat element to achieve the basking spot temperature, all of which should be placed outside of the cage to prevent burns.</p><p>All chameleons need a full spectrum ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light source. Keep the full spectrum UV light on for 10 to 12 hours per day and follow the manufacturer's recommendation for the distance that the bulb should be placed from where your chameleon can climb (usually 6 to 12 inches).</p><p>Remember these bulbs need to be replaced every six months. Chameleons also benefit from spending time outdoors in natural sunlight when the temperatures are warm enough (but beware of overheating so make sure shade is always available).</p><h2>Humidity and Hydration </h2><p>Veiled chameleons need a moderate humidity level (around 50 percent). Misting the plants twice daily will help with humidity levels and a drip or misting system is also recommended. Chameleons rarely drink from a water bowl but they will lap up droplets of water off plants so the misting/drip system also serves as a water source. Position a drip system so the water droplets cascade over the plants in the enclosure. Invest in a hygrometerto measure the humidity.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Veiled chameleons are mostly insectivores so theyshould be fed a variety of insects every other day. Crickets are usually the mainstay of the diet but locusts, roaches, butterworms (good for calcium), silkworms, flies, and grasshoppers can be fed, as well as mealworms, superworms, and waxworms (in limited quantities as they are high in fat).</p><p>Be wary of wild-caught insects due to possible exposure to pesticides and always avoid feeding lizard ants or fireflies. All insects should be gut-loaded. Many veiled chameleons will also eat a bit of plant matter so it is vital that only non-toxic plants are used in your chameleon's enclosure.</p><p>You can offer small amounts of vegetables and fruits such as dandelion leaves, collard greens, kale, diced zucchini, butternut squash, red pepper, blueberries, and thin slices of apple or pear. Monitor your chameleon and adjust feeding amounts as needed. If many insects are left uneaten or your chameleon is too full-bodied you may want to reduce the amount you're feeding them.</p><p>Never leave live prey in the cage for extended periods of time as insects may attack your chameleon, which can lead to infection.</p><p>It is prudent to dust insects with a calcium/vitamin D3 supplement two to three times a week. A multi-vitamin and mineral supplement can be added once a week. Some experts recommend choosing a supplement that does not contain vitamin A; instead, use beta-carotene.</p><h2>Choosing Your Veiled Chameleon </h2><p>As with most exotic lizards, there's no way to know if a wild-caught variety has been exposed to parasites or other potential infections. It's best to get your veiled chameleon from a reputable breeder. Watch it eat before committing to buying it if possible, to observe any appetite issues.</p><p>If its eyes are cloudy or there's any mucus around its mouth or nasal passages, these may be signs of a sick chameleon. And if it has dry patches on its skin, this may indicate a problem shedding.</p><p>Once you've chosen a veiled chameleon, have a reptile veterinarian check it for parasites. This isn't a condition that will necessarily be obvious.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like many lizards, veiled chameleons are prone to respiratory infections, and stress-related ailments. Calcium and vitamin A deficiency, which result from a poor diet, are also fairly common.</p><p>If your chameleon shows redness or excess saliva around its mouth, this may be a sign of mouth rot or stomatitis. This should be treated by a veterinarian with exotic reptile experience.</p><p>Metabolic bone disease, a result of insufficient UVB light, is another common condition among veiled chameleons. They may appear to have wobbly legs, or become lethargic and have a poor appetite. This is another condition that is treatable if caught early enough, but consult your veterinarian; a low appetite is a sign of many possible conditions for chameleons, including a parasitic infection.</p>",1136

This beautiful creature may be the pet for you if you're willing to make the commitment to properly care for it.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Being territorial and solitary animals, chameleons should be kept by themselves; males are especially aggressive toward one another.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Chameleon</p><p>Adult Size: Widely varies27 inches at largest, and .5 inches at smallest</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 to 10 years in captivity</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About Chameleons</h3><h2>Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Young chameleons are usually a dull gray/brown color and can change shades a bit. At around five months of age, the adult color and the ability to change colors develop, and a range of colorsincluding green, blue-green, turquoise, and blackcan be seen.</p><p>Changing colors provide camouflage, temperature regulation, and a means of communicating with other chameleons. Similar to anoles, chameleons change colors in response to excitement, stress, temperature, lighting conditions, the presence of another chameleon, and other influences.</p><p>Generally, a dark brown to black chameleon is stressed, with the brighter colors reflecting a happier mood.</p><p>Chameleons use their tongues to catch prey. A chameleon's tongue can be up to 1.5 times the length of its body, allowing chameleons to catch insects from a distance. They primarily eat insects, but some willeat vegetation and small invertebrates.</p><p>Chameleonfeet have three toes pointing in one direction and two that point the opposite way, which gives them a good grip on the tree branches they spend most of their time on. Many species also have prehensile tails. They have globular eyes that rotate like turrets and move independently, allowing them to scan a wide radius to hunt for food and look out for predators.</p><h2>Housing a Pet Chameleon </h2><p>The natural habits of chameleons make them tricky to care for. Chameleons are arboreal, meaningthey live exclusively in trees. They need cages with ample foliage for climbing and privacy, and the enclosure must be quite large.</p><p>For the larger chameleons a cage measuring 3 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet tall should be provided, but the more space the better. Ample ventilation is required, and a cage screened on three sides is best with poly mesh or vinyl coated wire preferred to prevent toe injuries.</p><p>Branches of various diameters need to be provided for climbing and the bulk of the cage space should be filled with these branches or live foliage. Ensure that the plants are not toxic, as the chameleon may eat the foliage.Substrate made up of small particles (such as gravel, sand, bark, or moss) should be avoided to prevent the chameleon from accidentally eating it while catching prey.</p><p>Several basking areas of various temperatures must also be provided in a chameleon's enclosure. Some chameleons are happier at higher temperatures, others at lower temperatures. Be sure to research the specifics for your breed.</p><p>Chameleons get their water from droplets on leaves so as a rule, they will not take water from a dish. Adequate water intake must be provided either through a drip system or by misting the enclosure at least twice daily.</p><p>Drip systems can be purchased or fashioned from a water container with a pinhole placed on top of the cage, or even by placing ice cubes on top of the cage to melt slowly and drip into the cage. If a drip system is used, keep the watering location consistent so the chameleon knows where to find water. Misting will also help keep the humidity levels up.</p><p>With a drip system, excess water should be collected and removed to prevent the humidity from getting too high.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Chameleons need exposure toUVA and UVB rays. In addition, allowing some exposure to natural sunlight through an open window (glass filters out nearly all of the necessary UV radiation) will help keep chameleons happy and healthy. The UVB lights should be on for 10 hours a day.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Follow manufacturer directionsto make sure you do not cause thermal burns on your chameleon.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Chameleons seem to do best on a variety of insects so you should try to feed as many types of insects as possible to your pet. Crickets, mealworms, super worms, wax worms, wax moths, and roaches are all good items to feed.</p><p>Prey food should be gut loaded with calcium prior to feeding and should be dusted with a calcium supplement. Some nutritious leafy greens (avoid spinach, lettuce, and cabbage) and other vegetables and fruits can be offered in small amounts as chameleons will occasionally eat these.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Many chameleons suffer from calcium and Vitamin A deficiencies, usually the results of a poor diet. They're also prone to mouth rot, or stomatitis, an infection around the mouth that shows redness and excess saliva or drooling.</p><p>Another common ailment among chameleons is metabolic bone disease. This condition, which can be fatal if not treated appropriately, causes a chameleon's bones to become spongy. They'll look lethargic and may lose their appetite.</p><p>As with any condition where your pet seems ill or stressed, it's best to consult a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. Try to avoid home remedies before you've consulted a vet.</p><h2>Choosing Your Chameleon </h2><p>When selecting a petchameleon, it is best to find a captive-bred one. Wild-caught specimens are usually extremely stressed, carry a heavy parasite load, and have difficulty acclimating to captive conditions.</p><p>Chameleons are not the hardiest nor easiest reptiles to keep, and starting with a stressed pet will only make matters worse. In addition, the capture and shipping of chameleons (which fortunately is being more tightly regulated) results in the deaths of many animals. Many more die in transit than make it to the pet store.</p><p>Once you've found a captive bred chameleon, observe them. They should be bright and active, able to change colors, and have a well-fleshed body.</p><h2>Different Species of Chameleon </h2><p>There are several species of chameleons that are popular aspets.</p><p>You can check out our other chameleon breed profiles here if you're still deciding which is the right pet for you.</p><p>Depending on where you live, chameleons can cost from $30 to $300.</p><p>Most chameleons don't enjoy being pet, but you can try some gentle rubbing under your chameleon's chin and see if it enjoys that.</p><p>Yes, they get darker when they are stressed, and appear lighter and brighter when they are calmer or excited.</p>",1132
11,https://www.thesprucepets.com/panther-chameleon-1238537,Reptiles & Amphibians > Chameleons,<h1>How to Care for a Panther Chameleon</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Panther Chameleon</h1><p>Panther chameleons exhibit many different brilliant color morphs or phases named after the geographic location they come from in their native habitat of Madagascar.</p><p>Females show less variation in color (often orange or brownish) and have a less dramatic ""helmet"" than males (comprised of ridges along the sides of the head), as well as being smaller.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Panther chameleon</p><p>Adult Size: Panther chameleons can reach up to around 21 inches in length, although those in captivity tend to stay a bit smaller (this includes the tail). Males tend to be larger than females.</p><p>Life Expectancy: Approximately 5 years in captivity.</p><p>Difficulty of Care: Easy</p><h2>Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Panther chameleons are territorial and should be housed individually. Handling tends to be stressful, so as with other chameleons, they are pets that are better suited to being watched rather than handled a lot.</p><p>Panther chameleons, like most other species of chameleon, is territorial; if two males are housed together in captivity, they change color andsometimes attack each other. In the wild, this is part of the ritual of males choosing female mates.</p><p>These lizards have exceptionally long tongues, with which they can snatch their prey out of mid-air.</p><p>They don't live very long in captivity, but their generally docile demeanor and the fact they're relatively easy to care for compared to other lizards make panther chameleons a favorite among lizard owners.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Chameleons should never be kept in glass terrariums. They need the ventilation provided by a mesh enclosure. Fine metal or fiberglass mesh is not recommended for chameleon enclosures; PVC coated hardware cloth is good.</p><p>Vertical space is essential to allow the chameleon to climb, and a cage size of 36 inches by 24 inches by 36 to 48 inches tall is recommended (the bigger and taller the betterchameleons like to climb high up off the ground). An outdoor cage can be used when the weather is warm enough, as long as overheating is prevented.</p><p>Provide lots of sturdy non-toxic plants and branches. Ficus trees have often been used in chameleon housing, but require some caution as the sap can be irritating. Other plants you could try include pothos, hibiscus, and dracaena. Artificial plants may also be added, and artificial vines are a great addition. A good selection of branches of different diameters should be provided, making sure there are secure perches at different levels and temperatures within the cage.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Cleanliness in the cage is vital to prevent bacterial or mold growth. Using paper towels or newspaper to line the cage makes cleaning easiest. Potted plants can be placed on a plain paper substrate for easier cleaning while still allowing live planting in the cage. Do not use wood chips or any other substrate that could be accidentally ingested and cause blockages.</p><h2>Temperature </h2><p>A daytime temperature gradient of between 75 and 90 degrees should be provided, with a basking spot at 95 degrees, At night, the minimum temperature should not drop more than 15 degrees. Heating is best accomplished by a basking or incandescent light in a reflector or a ceramic heat element, any of which should be placed outside of the cage to prevent burns.</p><h2>Lighting </h2><p>Chameleons need an ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light source, so invest in a good bulb such as the Zoomed Reptisun 5.0. Keep the UV light on for 10 to 12 hours per day. Remember these bulbs need to be replaced every 6 months. Chameleons also benefit from spending time outdoors in natural sunlight when the temperatures are appropriate (but beware of overheatingmake sure shade is always available).</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Panther chameleons need a high humidity level; it's best to aim for between 60 and 85 percent. This can be accomplished by misting the plants regularly, and a drip or misting system is also recommended.</p><p>Chameleons rarely drink from a water bowl, but they will lap up droplets of water off plants, so the misting/drip system also serves as a water source. Position a drip system so the water droplets cascade over the plants in the enclosure. Invest in a hygrometer to measure humidity.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Panther chameleons are insectivores so should be fed a variety of insects. Crickets are usually the mainstay of the diet, but locusts, roaches, butter worms (good for calcium), silkworms, flies, and grasshoppers can be fed, as well as mealworms, super worms, and waxworms.</p><p>Be wary of wild-caught insects due to possible exposure to pesticides and avoid fireflies.</p><p>All insects should be gut loaded (fed fresh veggies and vitamin/minerals) before feeding. In addition, some chameleons will also eat a bit of plant matter, including collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, and sugar snap pea pods.</p><p>If you find uneaten insects or your chameleon seems to be gaining a lot of weight, you can cut back on the amount you're feeding, or how often you feed it. And remember to never leave live prey in the cage for extended periods as insects may attack the chameleon.</p><p>Make sure to gut load your insects well, and it's prudent to dust insects with a calcium/vitamin D3 supplement (e.g. Rep-Cal) two to three times a week and use a broad vitamin-mineral supplement once a week. Some experts recommend choosing a supplement that does not contain vitamin A (use beta-carotene instead).</p><h2>Choosing Your Panther Chameleon </h2><p>Look for a chameleon whose eyes are clear, and who doesn't show the signs of a respiratory infection: difficulty breathing or wheezing, lethargy and a lack of appetite. If it has dry skin patches, that may be a sign of a parasitic infection.</p><p>As with all exotic pets, the best option is a reputable breeder who specializes in reptiles.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Calcium and vitamin A deficiencies are common among chameleons including the panther. This condition is usually the result of a poor diet.</p><p>And like other chameleon breeds, panthers are prone to mouth rot, or stomatitis, an infection around the mouth that shows redness and excess saliva or drooling.</p><p>Perhaps the most serious illness for captive chameleons is the metabolic bone disease. This condition, which can be fatal if not treated in a timely fashion, causes a chameleon's bones to become weak and brittle. A chameleon with this disease will appear lethargic and may lose their appetite.</p><p>As with any condition where your pet seems ill or stressed, consult a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p>",1056
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/keeping-green-anoles-as-pets-1236899,Reptiles & Amphibians > Chameleons,<h1>Green Anoles</h1>,"<h1>Green Anoles</h1><p>Green anoles are known by many names but they are also known for their ability to change colors from green to brown and back again (although they are not true chameleons). They are often found running around and basking in the sun in the Southeastern United States and islands in the Caribbean as well as in terrariums across the country as pets.</p><h3>What Is an Anole?</h3><p>An anole is a small tree-dwelling lizard with 250 species that is native to the Americas.</p><h2>Green Anole Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Green anoles are the only breed of anole native to the United States; they can be found in the wild in Tennessee, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas, and Texas. Green anoles are very popular and make good ""starter"" pets for children. These pretty little lizards have emerald-green backs and pink ""dewlaps"" (pouches under their chins). An occasional anole may even have a blue tint.</p><p>Anoles are fun to watch, as they are active during the daytime and love to climb. One of their best attributes is their willingness to interact with their human owners; many are willing to eat from their owners' hands. While it is fine to pick an anole up (and many enjoy perching on a human shoulder), it's important to avoid grabbing them by the tail. Instead, teach children to pick them up by placing a hand under the lizard's belly.</p><h2>Housing the Green Anole </h2><p>Anoles can be housed in a fairly small tank or terrarium. A 10-gallon tank is sufficient for a single or pair of anoles.A larger tank is, of course, better though and if you are housing multiple anoles lots of space is necessary.</p><p>You should only keep one male anole per tank. Females will get along fine as long as the tank is roomy enough, and there plenty of basking spots and multiple places to hide. A securely fitted lid is necessary since green anoles can squeeze through very small places.</p><p>A humidity level of 60 to 70 percent is necessary for green anoles (use a hygrometer to monitor these levels). This can usually be achieved by misting the inside of the tank daily. Misting systems are available although they are quite expensive. If you are having a hard time maintaining the humidity level try covering part of the top of the tank and/or increasing the number of live plants in the enclosure. Misting also provides drinking water for the anoles as they often will not drink from a bowl (they will lick droplets of water off the misted plants like chameleons).</p><h2>Heat and Lighting </h2><p>During the day be sure to provide a thermal gradient from 75 to 80 F (24 to 27 C) with a basking spot of 85 to 90 F (29 to 32 C). A combination of under tank heaters and a basking light on one side of the tank works well. Make sure the appropriate temperature gradient is provided by measuring temperatures in various spots around the tank. Night temperature can drop to a gradient of 65 to 75 F (18 to 24 C). Do not use white basking lights to achieve nighttime temperatures but instead use heating pads, ceramic heating elements, or special night heat lights.</p><p>In addition to the incandescent basking light, you should provide a full spectrum UVA/UVB light for 10 to 12 hours per day. This special light will help prevent your anole from developing metabolic bone disease and keep them looking brightly colored, active, and happy. The bulb needs to be changed out every six months (even if it hasn't burned out) and nothing should be blocking the light other than a metal mesh screen (no plastic or glass).</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>A substrate of peat moss and soil with or without a layer of bark (e.g. orchid bark) is an ideal substrate for anoles. Live plants help maintain humidity and provide cover. Favorite live plants include sansevierias (snake plants), bromeliads, philodendrons, ivy, orchids, and vines. Pieces of bark and branches should also be provided for climbing and basking. Avoid oily or scented substrates such as wood shavings, and stay away from very dry substrates such as sand.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Green anoles are insectivores and are generally good eaters.While crickets can be the main part of the diet, it is best to feed a variety of gut loaded insects including mealworms and wax worms.Feed two to three appropriately-sized prey itemsthat are about half the size of the anole's head every other day. A calcium and vitamin supplement should also be dusted on the insects.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>In general, green anoles are hardy animals and are rarely ill. They can, however, develop respiratory issues, mouth rot, or a metabolic bone disease that results in weight loss and swollen joints.</p><p>You should always consult a veterinarian if you see any of these problems. Meanwhile, however, do check to be sure that your pet's substrate and diet are appropriate, as problems with these are often the cause of stress-related illness.</p><h2>Choosing Your Green Anole </h2><p>Green anoles are available at almost any pet shop and should be relatively inexpensive. Look for an active, alert specimen and be sure that other anoles at the shop look healthy and well cared for. It's helpful to know that missing toes are not a problem: green anoles lose and regenerate them with no health implications.</p><p>Give your new pet a few days to acclimate to its new home before taking it out to play. If possible, locate a vet with reptile experience, and bring in your green anole for a ""well pet"" checkup.</p>",937
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/oriental-fire-bellied-toads-1236815,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>Oriental Fire-Bellied Toad: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Oriental Fire-Bellied Toad: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Native to rice paddies and the highlands of southern and southeastern Asia, Oriental fire-bellied toads have bright green and black coloration on their warty backs and brilliant orange and black on their undersides. Despite its name, this amphibian is technically a frog, not a toad. One characteristic differentiating frogs from toads is toads have rough, textured skin. And, while this frog has bumpy skin, it is one of the exceptions.</p><p>Oriental fire-bellied toads are hardy, colorful littlecreaturesthat are suitable pets for beginners. You will not be able to hold it much, but they are interesting to observe. They are not difficult to care for, although they do take a fair amount of work to maintain.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Oriental Fire-Bellied Toad</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Oriental Fire-Bellied Toad Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The bright colors of these frogs are a warning to predators to stay away, including humans. Its skin excretes a toxin. This clever frog announces its toxicity to potential predators by flashing its bright, fiery colored belly. Most predators recognize that such bright colors indicate that eating this particular frog can make them ill.</p><p>While it is somewhat toxic to humans, regular handling of the warty, semiaquatic Oriental fire-bellied toad is not recommended as it secretes poison from its skin. This toxin is not strong enough to kill or severely harm a human, however, it may induce skin sensitivity. If the poison is on your hand, and you put your finger in your eye, it can cause pain, so avoid handling this creature if you have any cuts on your hands. Always wash your hands thoroughly before and after touching them or cleaning their tanks as all frogs have sensitive skin that can react to oils or soaps on your skin.</p><p>Due to their potential toxicity, do not house these toads with other animals.Regular cleaning and water changes will help keep toxins from building up in the tank.</p><p>Fire-bellied toads do not have extendable tongues, so they use their mouths and forelegs to grab their food and stuff it into their mouths. It will rarely bite you; if it does, your finger was likely mistaken for food.</p><h2>Housing the Oriental Fire-bellied Toad </h2><p>At the minimum, get a 10-gallon tank for this animal's enclosure. You can house two or three frogs in a tank of this size. If you get more frogs, plan on about 4 gallons of tank space per frog. The horizontal or long aquariums provide more floor space for their size. A secure lid is a necessity. These active little frogs will try to escape if given a chance. The top should allow adequate ventilation.</p><p>A semiaquatic tank is an ideal set up with a third to half of the tank as land area, and the remainder should be about two to four inches of water. You can decorate the land area with smooth rocks.</p><p>The water should have a filter, and frequent water changes are necessary. Use only dechlorinated stale water or bottled spring water in the tank. These frogs produce a lot of waste, so you will need to do frequent partial water changes.</p><p>Expect to clean out the cage thoroughly once a week. While cleaning, place the frog in a secure second tank. Scrub the tank and furnishings. Rinse thoroughly with hot water, do not use any detergents or chemicals. To make cleaning easier, get removable tubs or basins for each side. You can also use smooth gravel on the water side as well as live or artificial plants.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>A heater is not usually necessary as these frogs can handle standard human room temperature, although slightly warmer temperatures are ideal, roughly 75 to 78 F. Use a thermometer to accurately gauge the temperature. Set up a basking area with a low wattage lamp set for 12-hours per day, mirroring the day and night cycle. You can use an under-tank heat mat under the terrestrial portion of the enclosure to heat the tank; if you keep the substrate moist, the two together will help increase tank humidity.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>These frogs have no specific lighting requirements other than a day and night cycle. Many experts agree that this species does not need UVB lighting. However, some experts state that a low dose of daily UVB can't hurt and might help with calcium absorption. Most importantly, this species requires humidity. Sometimes too much light can dry out the enclosure, which can damage the animal's sensitive skin. Extended light periods may also stress out your frog.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Humidity is essential for this species, so pick a substrate that will help you maintain high humidity and keep it moist by spraying it every day with a water bottle. Aim for 65 to 80 percent humidity at all times. A hygrometer or humidity gauge will help you check moisture levels. If you have difficulty maintaining the moisture on your own, invest in a mister or humidifier for your enclosure. You can automate it, setting it to go off at timed intervals or when low humidity levels are detected. If all else fails, your frog can also get adequate hydration and humidity from the aquatic portion of its enclosure.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the bedding or lining for the bottom of your pet's cage. Sphagnum moss, coconut husk, and organic, fertilizer-free potting soil are excellent substrates for the terrestrial side of your frog's cage. Provide a depth of about 2 to 4 inches, since fire-bellied toads often burrow. Include damp moss, other plants, and some areas to hide in the terrain portion of the tank.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Oriental fire-bellied toads will eat a variety of prey items, including crickets, other insects, such as waxworms and earthworms, and small feeder fish like guppies. Avoid feeding mealworms because their tough exoskeleton can be too tough to digest. Never feed wild insects; they often have parasites, pesticides, and herbicides.</p><p>The water used in the tank must not have chlorine or chloramine, which may be in municipal tap water. To be safe, use a pet supply product made for removing chlorine and chloramine which can harm or kill your pet frog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Red leg disease, caused by a parasitic infection, is a common condition in captive pet frogs, including Oriental fire-bellied frogs. Frogs or toads with this disease develop reddening of the legs as an early symptom. Other signs include unresponsiveness or sluggishness.</p><p>Most frogs are susceptible to fungal infections. Look for inflammation on its face or an oozing a cottony-like substance on its skin.</p><p>Red leg disease and fungal infections are treatable if caught early. Treatment requires a visit to an exotics veterinarian who has experience with amphibians.</p><h2>Choosing Your Oriental Fire-bellied Toad </h2><p>This small and easy-to-care-for animal makes an excellent pet for a beginner frog owner. The best option for purchasing one is a reputable amphibian breeder, who can tell you the animal's history and any health conditions it might have.They can cost from $15 to $25.</p><p>A healthy frog has clear eyes. Although most healthy frogs have smooth skin, expect your Oriental fire-bellied toad to have rough, bumpy skin. If you can watch it eat before deciding, that's ideal; most frogs will not refuse food unless they're unwell.Red flags of frog illness or potential poor husbandry include lethargy, trouble breathing, or if its abdomen seems bloated.</p>",1230
14,https://www.thesprucepets.com/african-bullfrogs-1238715,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>African Bullfrog: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>African Bullfrog: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>African bullfrogs, also known aspixie frogs, are not your everyday White's tree frog or dwarf clawed frog, but their care is quite similar. These are large, classic-looking frogs that are native to Africa but found in homes around the world. They're primarily an olive green color with a lighter belly and orange around the limbs. They aren't cuddly pets; African bullfrogs have a well-earned reputation for being ornery. So if you want a pet you can handle and play with, this probably isn't the option for you. However, they are entertaining to watch and good for people new to keeping frogs, as their care is relatively easy. Just make sure to get their housing setup and diet correct, and they can live for many healthy years.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: African bullfrog, pixie frog</p><p>Adult Size: Males are 10 inches long and 4 pounds or more; females are 6 inches long and around 2 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy:15 to 25 years</p><h2>African Bullfrog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>African bullfrogs are only moderately active, but they can be fun to watch in their tanks. Overall, they're generally easygoing, low-maintenance animals. Expect to feed them roughly every other day and clean their tank once or twice a week. Also, note that males shouldn't be housed together as they can be territorial. Male bullfrogs also will guardand sometimes eattheir tadpoles in the wild.</p><p>Some African bullfrogs will tolerate a bit of handling for short periods.But you still must use caution when holding them to protect their delicate skin. Plus, they can easily use their powerful legs to spring out of your hands and potentially injure themselves. Moreover, these frogs have sharp teeth and have been known to bite humans who are handling them. They'll typically croak loudly to let you know when they're feeling stressed. But if you respect their boundaries, you should have a laid-back pet.</p><h2>Housing the African Bullfrog </h2><p>Pet frogs are fairly simple to care for, but you must ensure that your habitat is set up correctly. The larger your frog, the larger your tank needs to be. A medium-size African bullfrog should have at least a 10-gallon tank; bigger is better.</p><p>You can use small, smooth rocks for the bottom of the tank. Fill it about a thirdof the way with dechlorinated water and then use progressively larger stones to build up one side of the tank to create a beach. This will give them something they can easily climb onto and allow them some time out of the water when they want to dry off. Tank cleanings should occur one to two times per week or more to keep the water fresh.</p><p>A container of dirt can also be provided in the event your bullfrog wants to burrow. In the wild, African bullfrogs burrow their entire bodies into the dirt and hibernate for up to two years to escape the dry season. In captivity, though, we can control the temperature and humidity that our frogs live in, making it unnecessary for them to hibernate.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>A room that doesn't drop below 75 degrees Fahrenheit should be appropriate for your bullfrog. If you find the frog isn't very active or isn't eating much, try increasing the temperature. Simple water heaters designed for fish tanks and heat lights made for reptiles can be utilized to create an ideal environment for your African bullfrog.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>African bullfrogs require a cycle of around 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness each day. Keep them out of direct sunlight. A UVB light isn't essential, but it's often recommended to promote nutrient absorption.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Humidity is very important when caring for amphibians due to the nature of their skin. Bullfrogs require a damp tank and plenty of water to swim in. The humidity level should be around 80% to 90%, which you can monitor using a hygrometer. If you need to raise the tank's humidity level, mist the inside with clean water a few times a day.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your bullfrog's enclosure. It helps to maintain humidity in the environment, and it can make the tank feel more like the animal's natural environment. Coco fiber, made from coconut husks, is a good option for substrate. Peat moss is another option. The ideal is an organic product that retains some heat and moisture. Avoid using any soil that has been treated with insecticides or other chemicals.Be sure it's clean, and change it frequently. African bullfrogs are known to eat the substrate in their cages, so any material lining the enclosure should be easily digestible.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>These large frogs are quite the carnivores. A healthy bullfrog diet consists of gut-loaded crickets (crickets fed nutritious foods that pass to your pet), mealworms, and other available insects. It also includes small rodents, such as mice and baby rats called fuzzies, and even other smaller amphibians. Stay away from grocery store meat like chicken and beef. This muscle meat does not provide bullfrogs the same nutritions that the whole-prey items offer.</p><p>Young bullfrogs generally eat daily or every other day, and adults have meals two to three times per week. Place the food in a shallow dish or on a flat rock. It's best to change what's on the menu at each feeding for a varied diet that mimics what they would get in the wild. Also, avoid overfeeding these voracious eaters. Consult your veterinarian for how much to feed at each meal based on your frog's age and size. Finally, you may offer a shallow water dish in addition to the tank water if you wish.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Although these frogs live for many years, they don't need much in the way of health care. If the environment is warm and damp enough, your frog shouldn't have any skin issues. However, bacterial and fungal infections of the skin and eyes are common in pets that live in less-than-ideal conditions.</p><p>Intestinal parasites also can be an issue with pet bullfrogs. If your tank temperatures are warm enough and your frog still isn't eating well, bring your frog to an experienced exotics veterinarian to rule out parasitism. A yearly fecal sample should also be checked.</p><p>Moreover, be on the lookout for ammonia poisoning. This occurs when the frog is left in an enclosure with too much waste. Symptoms include lethargy, uncoordinated movements, and cloudy eyes. Death can occur within a few days. Clean the tank as soon as possible, and call your vet.</p><h2>Choosing Your African Bullfrog </h2><p>Acquire your African bullfrog from a reputable breeder or rescue organization. Look for reptile and amphibian groups online or consult your local pet shop for recommendations.

15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/african-clawed-frogs-as-pets-1236809,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>African Clawed Frogs: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>African Clawed Frogs: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>African clawed frogs get their name from the three claws on their hind feet, which are used to tear apart food. These aquatic frogs, which are found mainly in ponds and rivers throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, have become popular pets in large part because they're easy to care for and live a long time. They can be quite enjoyable for owners to watch, and a proper tank setup for them is fairly simple to accomplish.African clawed frogs are sometimes confused with dwarf clawed frogs. However, the African clawed frog has eyes on the top of its head while the dwarf frog's eyes are on the sides of its head. Moreover, African clawed frogs have flat snouts while dwarf frogs have pointed snouts. And African clawed frogs have webbed back feet and digits on their front feet (similar to hands) while dwarf frogs have four webbed feet.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: African clawed frog, African claw-toed frog</p><p>Adult Size: 2 to 5 inches long with females larger than males</p><p>Life Expectancy: About 15 years</p><h2>African Clawed Frog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>In the wild,African clawed frogs are considered an invasive species on four continents. They are hardy predators, with some even able to survive cold weather other frogs could not. Plus, they can adapt to a variety of food sources and are even known to eat the young of other frogs.</p><p>African clawed frogs can be fun pets to watch, but they're not meant for handling. As aquatic frogs, their skin dries out quickly when they're out of water. However, some African clawed frogs can learn to take food from their keeper's hands, which can be a fun alternative to holding your pet. They do sometimes accidentally nibble on fingers, but this is not an issue because they lack teeth. Due to their hardiness and relative ease of care, they make good pets for first-time frog keepers.</p><h2>Housing the African Clawed Frog </h2><p>A 10-gallon aquarium is considered the minimum appropriate size for one African clawed frog. While African clawed frogs don't need a land area, the water should only be 7 to 12 inches deep for the frogs to easily reach the surface to breathe oxygen. A secure lid is a must, as these frogs are adept at propelling themselves out of the water and escaping when given the chance.</p><p>The water must be dechlorinated using a product from a pet store designed to remove chlorine. Or it can sit out for at least 24 hours to allow the chlorine to evaporate. Moreover, African clawed frogs are sensitive to the toxic effects of metal ions in the water, so ensure that the water you use does not come in contact with metal.</p><p>African clawed frogs have a sensory system that allows them to sense vibrations in the water. Thus, some experts believe using filters causes constant stress to the frogs, similar to a human constantly being exposed to noise from a jackhammer. However, some owners opt to use gentle filtration, which keeps the water a lot cleaner than going without a filter. If you don't use filtration, change the water at least every week.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>A heat source usually isn't required for African clawed frogs, as they do well at room temperature. Use an aquarium thermometer to make sure the tank stays at around 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (16 to 27 degrees Celsius).</p><h2>Light </h2><p>African clawed frogs typically don't need special UV lighting. Some people choose to provide indirect lighting or use a simple aquarium light to maintain a normal day-night cycle of around 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness each day.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your frog's aquarium. It can help to mimic the animal's natural environment and anchor plants and other decor. A gravel substrate can be used. However, avoid small gravel; you don't want your frog to ingest it. Use items, such as rocks, wood branches, and logs, to decorate the tank and provide hiding places. (Frogs with no place to hide can become stressed.) Live plants can also be added to the tank, though the frog might dig them up. Many people go the artificial route instead.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Many owners feed their African clawed frogs floating reptiles or amphibian sticks. While these sticks are typically well balanced, feeding a variety of foods is still a good idea. Items, such as waxworms, earthworms, feeder fish, bloodworms, brine shrimp, and freshwater snails are all good options. In addition, commercial food for clawed frogs can be purchased from some companies. As long as you provide a good balance, supplementation with vitamins and minerals is usually not necessary.</p><p>In general, overfeeding is more of a problem than underfeeding. Feed daily, and keep an eye on the body shape of your frog. If it seems to be overweight, cut back your feedings to once every other day. Also, consult your veterinarian on the proper amount to feed.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>African clawed frogs are prone to bacterial and fungal infections. They can also get dropsy, or severe bloat.Bacterial infections are often marked by cloudy eyesand redness or sores on the skin. The signs of a serious fungal infection include white growth that resembles cotton on the skin, as well as discolored eyes.</p><p>Moreover, like most aquatic frogs in captivity, African clawed frogs are prone to red-leg disease. This is a parasitic infestation that gets its name from an early symptom of reddened legs. This condition is easily confirmed and treated by a veterinarian.</p><p>Disease is often due to poor water quality in the tank. If you're concerned that your frog is unwell, don't try to treat it with a home remedy. Always consult a qualified veterinarian for advice.</p><h2>Choosing Your African Clawed Frog </h2><p>It's best to select a captive-bred frog from a reputable breeder or rescue organization. The group should be able to tell you the animal's origin and health history. Expect to pay around $20 to $30. Healthy frogs are active swimmers that hide frequently and have clear eyes and smooth skin. Be wary of a lethargic frog that doesn't readily accept food when it's offered, as such an animal is likely sick.</p><h2>Similar Species to the AfricanClawed Frog </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your new pet.</p><p>African clawed frogs are available in many pet stores, as well as through online merchants.</p><p>Male African clawed frogs croak when it's mating season and as they are looking to attract potential females to mate with.</p><p>At about 10 to 12 months, African clawed frog's reach sexual maturity.</p>",1148

As strictly terrestrial amphibians, they are very poor swimmers. Instead, they spend most of their time in a humid environment among damp leaf litter.Pacman frogs get their common name from the popular PacMan arcade game, because like the animated character, these frogs have a rounded appearance with huge mouths.Pacman frogs are not difficult to care for and they make interesting pets. However, for people who like their pets to be active or interactive, the Pacman frog may not be a good match, as it is not the best pet for handling.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Ornate horned frog, Pacman frog, Pac-man frog, Pac man frog, South American horned frog, Argentine horned frog, ornate Pacman frog, and Argentine wide-mouthed frog</p><p>Adult Size: 6 inches long (about as wide as they are long); females are larger than males</p><p>Life Expectancy: Around 6 years in captivity</p><h2>Pacman Frog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These amphibians are docile pets, but their counterparts in the wild have been known to bite if they feel threatened. A Pacman frog's appetite matches its size, and it will attempt to eat anything that moves within striking distance of where it sits on the ground. Any kind of prey that walks by is fair game for this hungry frog.</p><h2>Housing the Pacman Frog </h2><p>Pacman frogsdo not need a large cage since they are not very active. A 20-gallon tank is fine for one of these frogs. As they will often try to eat any cage mates, they should be housed alone. A cage top is recommended to help maintain temperature and humidity but Pacman frogs are not known to be at risk of escaping.</p><p>The tank can be lined with paper or smooth rocks, as long as leaf litter or moss and some plants (live or artificial) are provided for a Pacman frog to burrow in or hide. The substrate should be misted daily to help keep the tank humidity between 50% and 80%.</p><p>A shallow bowl of water should also be provided, one that allows the frog to drink and sit in without drowning. Depending on how humid your tank is, your Pacman frog might spend much of its time in its water dish, so providing plants around the dish will help your frog feel more secure. The water dish should also be in a warmer part of the cage so that the water does not get too cold.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>The temperature in the tank should be kept around 82 F during the day and allowed to drop to around 78 F at night. Heat is best supplied by using an under-tank heater as overhead incandescent bulbs can be too drying for your frog (although a red incandescent could be used if supplemental heat is needed at colder times).</p><h2>Light </h2><p>For lighting, a fluorescent fixture can be used although your frog might prefer more subdued lighting; regular room light may even be enough. Maintain a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle. Some owners recommend providing a UVA/UVB light for this 12-hour cycle.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Pacman frogs are fairly easy to feed since they are not fussy eaters. Smaller Pacman frogs can be fed insects such as crickets, or other common pet store prey insects such as mealworms, and wax worms that are gut loaded prior to feeding.</p><p>As your frog grows, it can be fed pinkie (newborn) mice and eventually larger mice. Adult-sized frogs may take a medium-sized mouse or pinkie rat.Guppies, a variety of insects, and even smaller frogs can also be fed to your Pacman frog.</p><p>While small Pacman frogs that are eating insects should be fed daily, larger frogs that are fed mice or feeder fish can be fed only every few days. The best guide is to feed based on your frog's body condition: If your frog is getting too round and fat, cut back on how often it is fed.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavioral Problems </h2><p>Bacterial and fungal infections of the skin and eyes are among the most common ailments of amphibians, and the Pacman frog is no exception. Any redness, swelling, or pus is a sign of an infection.</p><p>Pacman frogs also are susceptible to parasitic infections.If your tank temperatures are warm enough and your frog still isn't eating well, bring your frog to an experienced exotics vet to rule out parasitism. A yearly fecal sample should also be checked to make sure your frog doesn't have an overgrowth of common parasites.</p><p>Although less common in frogs than in other reptiles and amphibians, a Pacman frog kept in an enclosure without enough humidity may develop a respiratory infection. This is marked by wheezing, drooling, and lethargy. Also, be on the lookout for ammonia poisoning. This potentially fatal condition occurs when waste in an animal's enclosure is not properly cleaned.</p><p>All of the above conditions can be treated by a veterinarian if detected early enough.</p><h2>Choosing Your Pacman Frog </h2><p>When deciding on a Pacman frog as a pet, look for an active, alert animal that has clear eyes and whose skin appears free of blemishes. If you are able to watch it eat before deciding, that's ideal; rarely will a Pacman frog refuse food unless it's ill.If the Pacman frog you're interested in seems lethargic or is having trouble breathing, or if its abdomen seems bloated, these may be signs of illness.</p><p>The best bet for acquiring a Pacman frog is via a reputable breeder who can give you a complete health history on your potential pet. Captive-bred Pacman frogs are the better option because they're less likely to be exposed to parasites and other ailments that wild-caught frogs may have.</p><h2>Similar Species to Pacman Frogs </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your pet!</p><p>Pacman frogs grow to be about 6 inches long.</p><p>Pacman frogs that eat insects should be fed once a day. Pacman frogs that eat fish or mice should be fed every few days.</p><p>Breeding Pacman frogs can be a tricky endeavor.

These lizards hail from New Caledonia, an island country off the coast of Australia. They were once thought to be extinct but were ""rediscovered"" around 1994. Since then, theirpopularity aspetshas continually increased.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Crested geckoNew Caledonian crested gecko, eyelash gecko</p><p>Adult Size:7 to 9 inches, including their prehensile tails</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 20 years</p><h2>Crested Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Crested geckoscome in awide array of colors and markings (morphs). They get their name from the fringed crest that begins over their eyes and runs down their necks and backs, though the size of the crest varies.</p><p>Crested geckos have specialized toe pads that allow them to move along vertical surfaces effortlessly, and their prehensile tails add to their agility. They are also excellent jumpers.</p><p>Crested geckos usually have relatively docile temperaments, though they are a bit skittish and care is required when handling. They don't usually like handling, so avoid it if possible. They may try to jump away from you, which can injure them. Crested geckos may drop their tails if handled roughly or to attempt to get away; unlikeother geckos,they willnotregenerate their tails.</p><p>They will only bite if they feel threatened. Bites are startling, though they do not hurt and are not strong enough to cause bleeding.</p><h2>Housing the Crested Gecko </h2><p>A minimum of a 20-gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for an adult, but a larger tank is better. Crested geckos are arboreal, active, and need lots of vertical space for climbing, so a tall tank is preferred. Two to three crested geckos can be housed in a tall 29-gallon terrarium. Males are territorial, so keep only one male per tank. You can use a glass terrarium with a screened side for ventilation, but some keepers prefer screened enclosures.</p><p>Crested geckos need room to climb, so provide a mix of branches, driftwood, cork bark, bamboo, and vines at a variety of heights and orientations. Add a variety of silk or sturdy live plants (such as (pothos), , , and ) as they will hide in the plants for cover.</p><p>Every day, you will need to remove all uneaten food and spot clean to remove feces. Clean the entire terrarium and its decorations at least once a month using reptile-safe disinfectants. Depending on the substrate, you will need to replace it weekly or monthly to prevent bacterial growth.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>As cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature. A daytime temperature gradient of 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 26.5 degrees Celsius) should be provided for crested geckos with a drop at night to 65 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius). Monitor with temperatures gauges to ensure the cage does not overheat. Crested geckos get stressed at higher temperatures. A low-wattage red nighttime bulb makes a good heat source, and it also allows you to view the lizard at night when it is most active. Do not rest a heat source on the top of the tank as these climbing geckos could get too close and get burned.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Crested geckos are nocturnal; technically, they do not need special UVB lighting. However, some experts suggest that a of UVB lighting (about 5 percent) is beneficial for overall reptile health. Any added lighting will raise the temperature in the enclosure, so monitor that. Also, provide a gecko hideaway, so geckos can get away from the light if they want.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Crested geckos need a moderate to high humidity level of about 50 to 70 percent. Get a hygrometer (humidity gauge) to monitor levels daily. Provide humidity with regular misting with warm, filtered water. Depending on your cage setup, you may need to mist it a few times a day to keep the humidity up. Always make sure the cage is well-misted at night when the geckos are most active. If you are not around during the day or cannot physically mist the enclosure, get an automatic mister or fogger to add humidity to the cage at timed intervals.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most pet owners use a substrate to line the bottom of the cage. When selecting a substrate for a gecko, consider pet safety, ease of cleaning, and if the substrate aids in retaining humidity. Ideal substrates for a crested gecko are coconut fiber bedding, moss, or peat. You can also use newspaper or paper towels, although these are not as attractive.</p><p>Crested geckos are somewhat prone to ingesting substrate while hunting; if this is the case for yours, use sphagnum moss (either alone or over another substrate like coconut fiber) or paper towels. Paper towels are recommended for juveniles as they are more likely to swallow other substrates accidentally.</p><p>Although attractive, gravel (or pebbles) is not a suitable substrate since it is difficult to clean thoroughly and regularly. Avoid reptile sand and non-organic soil substrate, since these are swallowing hazards.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Since they are nocturnal, feed crested geckos in the evening. Feed juveniles daily and adults three times a week.</p><p>A commercial crested gecko diet is usually well accepted and is the easiest way to ensure a well-balanced, nutritious diet. Supplement that food with crickets and other prey insects (roaches, waxworms, silkworms). Avoid feeding mealworms, since they have a hard, undigestible exoskeleton. For variety and to allow the gecko to exercise his hunting instincts, feed as much prey insects at one time as the gecko eagerly eats.</p><p>Insects fed should be slightly smaller than the space between the gecko's eyes and should be gut-loaded or fed nutritious foods before feeding to your lizard. To boost your reptile's vitamin and mineral intake, dust the insects with a calcium/vitamin D3 powdered supplement three times a week. You can dust prey items with a multivitamin powder supplement once a week as well.</p><p>Crested geckos will eat fruit several times a week. Try mashed fruit or jarred baby food. Favorites include bananas, peaches, nectarines, apricots, papaya, mangoes, pears, and passion fruit.</p><p>If you have difficulty finding a commercial gecko diet, provide a combination of insect prey items and fruit. This option is not the most balanced diet, but it will suffice in a pinch or for a short period. In this case, your best insect choice is crickets with the occasional addition of other insects for variety.</p><p>Provide a small shallow water dish with fresh water daily, though they will likely prefer to drink water droplets from leaves in the humid habitat.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Geckos are prone to a few health problems that are treatable by an exotics veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing Your Crested Gecko </h2><p>Crested geckos are commonly sold, mainly because they are so easy to care for and have such sunny dispositions compared to other lizards. Even though they're widely available at pet stores, try to get your crested gecko from a reputable breeder.You can expect to pay $40 to $150 for a crested gecko; the price increases with the rarity of the color or morph.</p><p>When picking out your gecko, make sure your gecko can climb well, has a straight spine, and no visible ribs or pelvic bones. It should appear lively and alert. Also, it should have bright eyes, as well as a clean nose and vent (fecal opening).</p>",1239
18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/tokay-geckos-1236913,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Tokay Gecko: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Tokay Gecko: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Tokay geckos aren't as common as pet leopard geckos, but they are just as interesting as their cousins. As the second-largest type of gecko, they're known for their vibrant colors and spots. They're usually a blue-gray color with bright orange and blue spots. They do have a reputation for being somewhat aggressive and aren't recommended for beginners. But once you have their tank set up, their care needs are fairly straightforward.</p><p>An arboreal species living in trees and on cliffs, tokay geckos are native to parts of Asia and some Pacific Islands. They're vocal animals, making a unique croaking noise that sounds like ""To-kay! To-kay!"" This is how they received their common name. According to some myths, they're said to bring good luck. However, they're also unfortunately frequent targets of poachers in the wild, because they are used in some medicinal remedies. People will dry their bodies to be boiled into tonics or ground into powders that claim to treat various conditions, including asthma, diabetes, cancer, and more. If you're looking for a captive-bred tokay gecko, first educate yourself about its needs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Tokay gecko</p><p>Adult Size: 15 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years on average</p><h2>Tokay Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Tokay geckos are nocturnal, meaning they're most active at night. During the day your gecko will sleep in a head-down position.In the wild, these geckos are known to be highly territorial. Males especially will attack any animals, including other tokay geckos, that they perceive as a threat. Moreover, tokays are excellent climbers and have relatively big heads compared to other geckos. They also have strong jaws and prehensile tails (tails capable of grasping onto things).And they're able to detach their tails to escape a predator.</p><p>Furthermore, tokay geckos have a reputation for being pretty feisty, and they can deliver a painful bite. With regular interaction, they can become less aggressive, but they generally aren't good for handling. Thus, this is not a pet for the novice herpetologist or a home with young children. These geckos are clever and will bite if they feel threatened.</p><h2>Housing the Tokay Gecko </h2><p>Never house male tokay geckos together. It's also best not to house your gecko in your bedroom, because its vocalizations might wake you up.</p><p>Because these are large geckos, a 20-gallon tank is the minimum size suitable for their housing. Provide sturdy branches, as your gecko will spend much of its time climbing. And add reptile-safe potted plants if you wish. (Artificial plants can also be used.) Plus, provide some hiding spots using cork bark, half logs, or caves.</p><p>Be sure your tank has a secure lid. Tokay geckos are strong and might attempt to escape if the opportunity presents itself. This can lead to a dangerous situation both for the gecko and for anyone in your home if the gecko feels the need to defend itself.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Aim for 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 32 degrees Celsius) during the day and 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 27 degrees Celsius) at night. An incandescent bulb can be used for heat during the day. But a nocturnal reptile bulb or ceramic heat element must be used at night to mimic the day-night cycle. Heat provided from above the tank is preferable over a heating pad because tokay geckos are climbers.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB-emitting bulbs generally are not necessary because tokay geckos are a nocturnal species, though some experts believe a low level of UV light can benefit their overall health. A red nighttime bulb will allow you to see your gecko at night when it's most active without interrupting the animal's natural day-night cycle.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Tokay geckos prefer a high humidity level of around 70 percent. Don't let it drop under 50 percent. Maintain humidity through misting, a substrate that retains water, and a bowl of water. But also make sure the tank has good airflow, because an environment that's too damp can lead to health issues. Measure the humidity level with a hygrometer.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your gecko's tank. It helps to maintain humidity, and certain substrates can mimic the look and feel of a gecko's natural environment. Orchid bark or coconut husk-based substrate are good choices for their moisture-retaining qualities. When the gecko is shedding, you can even use paper towels, which helps with cleanup. Select paper towels that have not been bleached and are free of ink designs.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Tokay geckos are usually voracious eaters and can be fed a variety of insect prey, including crickets, superworms, mealworms, waxworms, grasshoppers, and cockroaches. Larger tokays might even take pinky mice. Prey should be gut loaded (fed nutritious foods, which then pass to the gecko)and dusted with a vitamin supplement containing calcium. Juveniles can be fed every 24 hours; adults typically are fed every other day. Consult your veterinarian for how much to feed your gecko, based on its age and size.</p><p>As they would in the wild, tokay geckos often drink from the moisture droplets that land on the climbing branches in their enclosure from misting. But you should also include a shallow water dish on the bottom of the tank, so they always have a source of hydration.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Like many lizard species, geckos are susceptible to mouth rot, or stomatitis. Symptoms include a reddish appearance around the mouth or a cheesy-looking ooze. Excess saliva can indicate a respiratory infection.</p><p>They're also prone to parasitic infections on the skin as well as internally. A skin infection can look like a rash. And if your gecko is having difficulty shedding completely, this is another symptom of a skin problem.Moreover, internal parasites can cause sluggishness, changes in appetite, and unusual fecal deposits.</p><p>All of these conditions are treatable if caught early. Consult a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. Don't attempt to treat these ailments with home remedies.</p><p>In terms of behavioral issues, tokay geckos aren't cuddly pets. Handle them carefully and only when necessary to prevent injury. When they bite, they are known to clamp down and not want to let go.</p><h2>Choosing Your Tokay Gecko </h2><p>If you feel you can handle the feisty temperament of a tokay gecko, choose a captive-bred animal from a reputable breeder or animal rescue that can tell you about its origin and health. Expect to pay around $20 to $50. Choose a gecko whose ribs and pelvic bones aren't visible. You also shouldn't see any bumps on its skin, whichcan indicate an infection or a broken bone.</p><p>One way to determine whether a tokay gecko is healthy is to pick it up. A healthy gecko will dislike this and will vocalize or attempt to bite you, so be sure your hand is behind its head. If the gecko opens its mouth, it's getting ready to bite.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Tokay Gecko </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your new pet.</p>",1157

Day geckos, in general, are not good geckos for beginner reptile keepers as they are a high-maintenance pet. Some of the easier day geckos to care for include giant day geckos, gold dust day geckos, or lined day geckos.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Day gecko (includes 60+ species)</p><p>Adult Size:Sizes vary between species; smallest is 2.6 inches and largest is 11.8inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Smaller species, up to 10 years; larger species, up to 20 years</p><h2>Day Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Unlike many other lizards, including most other types of geckos, day geckos are active during the day. They are generally pretty fragile, and it is not a good idea to handle them since their skin is quite delicate. Handling can stress them out, and as a defensive mechanism, they may even drop their tail. While their tails will regenerate, the animal should never be forced into that situation.</p><p>If feeling threatened, they might bite, although that is the last resort. A bite from a giant day gecko, the largest of the day geckos, can hurt and may even break the skin.</p><p>House day geckos separately. Males are especially territorial, but even mated pairs may fight and need to be split up.</p><p>These lizards are excellent climbers. Their toe pads have tiny filaments (setae) that allow them to cling to almost any surface, including glass walls and ceilings.</p><p>Day geckos have particular care requirements and need attention every day. This lizard is only recommended for those who have prior reptile-keeping experience.</p><h2>Housing the Day Gecko </h2><p>Each gecko's requirements vary somewhat, so thoroughly research thegecko species, in order to have the appropriate cage, lighting, humidity, and food ready for its arrival. Being adequately prepared can decrease your gecko'sstress during the transition into its new environment.</p><p>Day geckos are great escape artists. A glass tank with a firmly closing screen top for ventilation works well for day geckos.</p><p>The exact cage set-up and environment required will vary a bit with each species of day gecko. As a general rule of thumb, day geckos will need an enclosure that is taller than it is wide with branches to climb on.</p><p>Place stalks of bamboo, branches, or live plants (snake plants, bromeliads, or other tropical plants) into the tank for climbing options and aesthetic appeal. Provide lots of cover and hiding spots to make your day gecko feel secure.</p><p>You will need to spot clean the cage every day to remove visible feces and do a full cleaning with a reptile-safe disinfectant once a month.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Exact requirements vary by species, but daytime temperatures should be between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit on the high end and between 72 and 77 degrees on the low end, which is usually during nighttime hours.As cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature. A thermal gradient in the cage allows the lizard to move around to different areas to control its body temperature.</p><p>Light bulbs can serve as your primary heat source and provide heat for the 90-95 degree basking spot. Thermometers are essential to gauge temperatures day and night.</p><p>If more heat is needed, especially at night, you can use ceramic heat emitters or under tank heating pads. Sometimes a variety of heat sources must be used to achieve ideal day and night time temperatures. To avoid burns, do not place heat sources too close or in direct contact with the gecko.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Day geckos need exposure to ultraviolet light, so fluorescent, full-spectrum UVB-emitting reptile bulbs are necessary. Provide 10 to 12 hours of UV light. Change the bulbs every six months,even if the light doesn't burn out. The invisible UVB rays stop emitting after that period.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>All day geckos need relatively high humidity in their enclosures, ranging anywhere from 60 percentto 80 percent, depending on the species. Get a hygrometer or humidity gauge to accurately detect the humidity level. The use of live plants and a proper substrate will help maintain moisture along with regular misting of the tank. If you are away during the day and will not be able to mist the cage, get an automatic mister or fogger to add humidity at timed intervals.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most pet owners use a substrate or bedding to line the bottom of the cage. In the case of day geckos, the right substrate helps maintain a humid environment. Ideal substrates for most day geckos are peat moss, organic potting soil (no vermiculite), or orchid bark.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Insects, such as roaches, silkworms, waxworms, and butterworms, make up the bulk of a day gecko's diet in captivity; some will also eat various tropical fruits such as papaya, mango, or even fruit baby food.</p><p>Most geckos will eatthree to five insects twice weekly and fruit baby food mixed with a commercial nectar substitute once a week. Juveniles and breeding females should be fed five to seven times weekly. Feed them in the morning when they are most active.</p><p>Insects fed should be slightly smaller than the space between the gecko's eyes and should be gut-loaded or fed nutritious foods before feeding to your lizard. The insects and fruit should also be dusted with a multi-vitamin powder and vitamin D3/calcium powder at every other feeding.</p><p>Provide a small, shallow water dish with fresh, filtered water daily, though they will likely prefer to drink water droplets from leaves in the humid habitat.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Geckos are prone to a few health problems that are treatable by an exotics veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing a Day Gecko </h2><p>As with most breeds of gecko, it's ideal to obtain one from a reputable reptile breeder. Captive-bred geckos are less likely to have diseases. If possible, ask the breeder if you can watch the day gecko eat before deciding on buying it. On average, they can cost $50 to $250. Babies usually cost the least since they have a higher mortality rate. Adults and morphs (color variants) often fetch a higher price.</p><p>A reputable breeder should also provide the gecko's full health history. To find a reputable breeder, ask local exotics vets and other reptile owners. You can often meet breeders at reptile expos and shows.</p><p>Health geckos have clear eyes and healthy appetites. As long as the animal doesn't refuse food, you can expect it to be in relatively good health.If you notice a gecko with dry, flaky areas on its skin or difficulty shedding, this could be signs of a parasite, infection, or inadequate husbandry.</p>",1135

A polymorphic species, gargoyle geckos also make popular pets because they can take on a variety of colors and patterns, including yellow, brown, white, gray, orange, and red.</p><p>Among their other defining traits are a triangular-shaped head, large bulging eyes, and semi-prehensile tail, as well as the round toe pads associated with other types of geckos. They also have cranial bumps that resemble horns, which is how they earned their unique name.</p><p>Most often found in the southern parts of New Caledonia, a small island nation east of the Coral Sea and Australia, the gargoyle gecko is a hardy, low-maintenance reptile that can make a great pet.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Gargoyle Gecko</p><p>Scientific Name: Rhacodactylus auriculatus</p><p>Adult Size: 6-10 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15-20 years</p><h2>Gargoyle Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The gargoyle gecko is known for its friendly nature. They adapt well to life as a pet and should live long, healthy lives assuming they are receiving proper care and having their basic needs met.</p><p>When stressed, you may notice your gargoyle gecko release its tail--it will take a few months to grow back. Though they will tolerate handling, be sure the first handling sessions are short with a day or two in between to give your reptile the time and space to learn to trust you.</p><p>Though they are usually rather docile, the gargoyle gecko can exhibit territorial behavior when housed with other geckos. However, in some cases, a single bonded pair can be housed together.</p><p>Gargoyle geckos are crepuscular, meaning that they are most active during both dawn and dusk. So don't be surprised if your gecko seems to remain still for most of the day and then starts climbing as the sun begins to rise or set.</p><h2>Housing the Gargoyle Gecko </h2><p>Fortunately, you're not going to need a significantly large enclosure for the gargoyle gecko. While it's possible to house them in a 10-gallon tank, a larger reptile vivarium (aim for at least 12x12x12) is recommended. Either glass or plastic will assist with humidity retention, and you may want to look for a front-facing door and vents.</p><p>These are arboreal geckos, which means they will want ample height to climb. The taller the tank, the more it will replicate their natural environment. You can add some climbable branches and vines, and even a small box for hiding at the bottom of the enclosure. Like most reptiles, the gargoyle gecko will appreciate a place to hide.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Unlike some other reptiles, gargoyle geckos don't require a particularly hot environment. Since these geckos are highly adaptable, you may not even need supplemental heating or light. However, most gecko owners opt for a heat source such as a heat lamp, preferably with white or clear low-wattage incandescent/halogen bulbs.</p><p>You'll want to be sure that temperatures don't reach 85 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are using a basking lamp, aim to keep one side of the enclosure in the upper 70s or low 80s, while the other side hovers around 74 degrees.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Gargoyle geckos can benefit from some form of light during the day, which will help regulate their day/night cycle as well as improve appetite, activity, and overall health. Aim to have their light on for about 12 hours a day.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>The gargoyle gecko requires moderately high humidity levels--aim for between 60 and 70 percent humidity in their enclosure at all times. A digital hygrometer can help gecko owners to monitor humidity levels, as well as adjusting the vents to ensure you're trapping enough moisture.</p><p>The substrate and plants can also be misted on a daily basis if needed. Depending on how well your gecko's enclosure holds humidity, you can mist heavily in the evening and then provide a light mist in the morning. The excess droplets can also be used as a drinking source for your gecko.</p><p>Incorporating live plants in your gecko's enclosure can also be helpful to maintain proper humidity levels -- a few options are Philodendron scanden, Devil's Ivy, and Ficus benjamina.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>You'll want to choose an absorbent substrate for your gargoyle gecko, such as bark chips, a mixture of soil and moss, or even newspaper. Just be sure the pieces are very small to prevent your gecko from consuming them.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Though they're omnivores, the gargoyle gecko is considered to be picky. Some may avoid eating live insects, for example, and may need to be fed commercial fruit- and vegetable-based foods. When being kept as a pet, these geckos are routinely fed waxworms and mealworms, crickets, and dubia roaches.</p><p>You can opt for gut-loaded insects as well as dusting them with calcium and multivitamin supplements (aim for every other feeding) in order to boost the nutritional value within their diet.</p><p>Though they generally don't drink a lot of water, it's still best to include a small water dish in your gecko's enclosure. A shallow dish is best because they may occasionally choose to soak in order to help with shedding, and be sure to clean and replenish the water regularly.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The gargoyle gecko isn't associated with any significant health problems, although they are prone to common ailments that affect reptiles--these include bacterial issues, respiratory infections, and metabolic bone disease.</p><p>Fortunately, these diseases can often be preventable. For example, metabolic bone disease occurs when your pet doesn't take in enough calcium since reptiles require UV exposure to naturally synthesize calcium. Respiratory infections are usually caused by improper temperature and humidity levels in your pet gecko's enclosure. A source of UV light and calcium supplements with their food can help ward off bone disease, while bacterial infections can be avoided with proper cleaning.</p><h2>Choosing Your Gargoyle Gecko </h2><p>Among the least expensive of all the species of gecko, you can typically take home a gargoyle gecko for as little as $50 (although some can cost up to a few hundred dollars). There are certain traits that can cause a gecko to run closer to $1,000. Keep in mind that a female gecko is generally more valuable (and likely more expensive) than a male.</p><p>You can find gargoyle geckos in a wide variety of colors and patterns, and they can also vary in size to a certain degree. You may want to inquire about the traits that your gecko has been bred for; in gargoyle geckos, for example, many breeders will selectively breed for their knob or horn size. You'll also want to observe your gecko for how it reacts to handling, as most gargoyle geckos will take time and patience to adapt to being handled by a human (and even then most will only tolerate it sporadically and for short periods of time).</p>",1117
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/panther-geckos-1238258,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Panther Gecko: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Panther Gecko: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Panther geckos ()are popular exotic pets thanks to their interesting markings and ease of care. Also known as the Madagascar ground gecko, this species hails from the island of Madagascar and is often found in the leaf litter of forests. Panther geckos are predominantly brown with black markings and big eyes. And they have a healthy appetite for crickets. They generally do well in captivity when given the proper environment, though they are typically quite timid and prefer not to be handled.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Panther gecko, ocelot gecko, Madagascar ground gecko, pictus gecko, Malagasy fat-tailed gecko</p><p>Adult Size: 4 to 6 inches long, with some males reaching 8 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 10 years</p><h2>Panther Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These small geckos not only are known for their beautiful patterns but also for their interesting personalities. Juveniles can be jumpy but tend to calm down and become docile as they get older. Overall, panther geckos are nocturnal, so they won't be terribly active during the day.</p><p>Although they're not ideal pets for homes with young children who might want to touch and hold the animal, panther geckos are suitable for first-time lizard owners who can commit to the animal's needs. These geckos don't respond well to stress. They don't like being handled and will bite as a warning if they feel threatened. (It's usually not much more than a warning bite and won't do much damage.) Panther geckos also can lose their tails when they feel stressed. The tail will regenerate eventually, though it will look different.</p><h2>Housing the Panther Gecko </h2><p>In the wild, panther geckos hang out in fallen leaves and other hideouts on the ground, but they do have the ability to climb. So an enclosure with a secure lid is necessary when housing these small lizards. They're not the escape artists that some other geckos are because they're not natural climbers. But if they do get out of their enclosure, it could be dangerous for them. Likewise, many panther gecko owners refrain from putting climbing branches in the enclosure, as these geckos can fall and hurt themselves.</p><p>Typically a 10-gallon tank will suffice.But if you plan on keeping more than one panther gecko in the same enclosure, you should upgrade to a 20-gallon tank. Don't put males together; they're too aggressive and territorialto live together.</p><p>Include a small dish of water for drinking and several hide boxes in your panther gecko's enclosure. Because they tend to be shy, they feel more secure when they have a hideout to retreat to for a while.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>These small geckos don't require excessive warmth, but they do need a basking area in the mid-80 degree Fahrenheit range. The tank also shouldn't drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit at night. This can be attained by using heat lights. Ones that emit white light shouldbe used during the day while heat lights that emit red or blue/purple light canbe used at night. You also can use a ceramic heat emitter at night, so you don't disturb this nocturnal lizard with bright light.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB lighting is not usually necessary. In the wild, panther geckos don't get much sunlight. But if you're having issues with your gecko being lethargic and not eating well, you can try adding UVB lighting for 10 to 12 hours during the day.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Panther geckos like an environment with around 60% humidity, especially when they're shedding. This can be achieved through misting and the enclosure's water dish. Use a reptile hygrometer to measure the humidity in the tank.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your gecko's enclosure. It helps to maintain humidity, and it can make the tank feel more like a gecko's natural habitat.The substrate can be as natural as you want with bark chips and a dirt jungle mix that is available in pet shops. Reptile carpeting cut to the size of your tank also works well and is easy to clean.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Panther geckos are insectivores, meaning most of their diet consists of insects. They will eat whatever insect they can find in the wild, but in captivity, crickets are usually the food of choice. Crickets are easy to find and can be gut loaded (fed nutritious foods, which then pass to the gecko) and dusted with calcium powder to provide all the essential nutrients a gecko needs.</p><p>Other insects, such as silkworms, small beetles, mealworms, and super worms, can also be fed as long as they are gut loaded, dusted with calcium powder, and of appropriate size. They should be no bigger than the space between your gecko's eyes. Some panther gecko owners introduce leafy greens to their pets' diet, but this isn't necessary.</p><p>Young geckos generally should eat every 24 hours, and adults should eat roughly every other day. Consult your veterinarian for the quantity to feed your pet, based on the animal's age and size. Place the food in a shallow dish or on a flat rock. Also, always include a shallow dish of clean water for drinking.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Problems with shedding usually happen when a gecko is in unsanitary living conditions or an enclosure that isn't humid enough. Failure to shed also occurs when a geckois overly stressed. It might not seem like a significant problem, but the extra skin can cause discomfort, affect its hearing, and constrict its limbs.</p><p>Metabolic bone disease is another ailment that can afflict geckos and other lizards. It's as ominous as it sounds and can be fatal if left untreated. It occurs due to vitamin D and calcium deficiency and can lead to weakened bones.</p><p>Furthermore, like other gecko species, panther geckos are prone to parasitic infections. An examination by a veterinarian who specializes in lizards is sometimes the only way to detect parasites in a gecko.</p><p>Don't try any home remedies to treat your gecko's health concerns unless you're being advised by a qualified veterinarian. You don't want to end up making what could be a treatable problem worse.</p><h2>Choosing Your Panther Gecko </h2><p>Get your panther gecko from a reputable breeder who can provide detailed information about the animal's health and origin. Expect to pay around $40 to $60 on average. Make sure the gecko is captive-bred, as wild-caught geckos typically fail to thrive as pets.</p><p>A gecko with dry spots on its skin might indicate a problem with shedding. This is often a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a parasite or infection. Also, look for a panther gecko with clear eyes, a curious demeanor, and a healthy appetite. Ideally, you'll be able to watch it eat before bringing it home.</p>",1118
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/care-of-pet-golden-geckos-1238765,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Golden Gecko: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Golden Gecko: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Golden geckos, which are native to Vietnam and southeast Asia, are intriguing lizards even though they aren't as popular as many other pet lizards. Males can be yellow-golden in color (sometimes with markings), while females tend to be darker and have more green on the body. Female golden geckos tend to be a bit smaller than males. This may not be the best gecko for a new lizard owner, as they have nocturnal habits. But if you're a night owl, this could be the pet gecko for you, although they do have an aversion to being handled.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Golden gecko</p><p>Adult Size: 7 to 8 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Golden Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Golden geckos are skittish and have delicate skin, so they are not good candidates for handling. They also have a bit of a reputation for biting when stressed. This may not be the best gecko for a new lizard owner, but if you're patient when handling is necessary, your gecko can eventually become docile.</p><p>Like many geckos, the golden will shed its tail when very stressed; they can also regenerate it. However, this is an extreme response from the gecko and it should never be picked up by its tail.</p><h2>Housing the Golden Gecko </h2><p>A 20-gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for a golden gecko, but a bigger habitat is a better home as golden geckos are active lizards. Golden geckos need vertical space for climbing so use a tall tank. Males are quite territorial so they should only be kept one to a cage. They have specialized toe pads that allow them to effortlessly move along vertical surfaces, and they can even cling upside down.</p><p>The substrate for golden geckos should be something that retains moisture, such as reptile bark or shredded coconut fiber bedding. Some keepers also use pure soil but avoid usingpotting soil, which often contains perlite, an inorganic material derived from mined volcanic glass of the same name. It can cause impactions in lizard if too much is accidentally ingested.</p><p>Golden geckos need room to climb, so provide branches, driftwood, and faux silk plants or live plants. They also need hiding spots such as reptile caves or clay plant pots that are placed on their sides. Make sure there are no sharp edges in the habitat. If you have multiple geckos, be sure to provide enough hiding space to allow themto hide from each other.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>A daytime temperature gradient of 75 to 90 Fshould be provided for golden geckos, with a drop at nighttime to 70 or 75 F. Heat can be provided via a ceramic heating element or a reptile bulb inside a reflector. Place any heat source only on one end of the tank so that the other end stays colder. Do not rest a heat source right at the top of the tank, as these climbing geckos could get too close and burns could result.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Since golden geckos are nocturnal, there's no need for special light spectrums. However, many experts suggest thatproviding some UV lighting is still beneficial to a gecko's overall health. White incandescent bulbs or blue reptile bulbs can also be used during daytime hours, and red reptile night bulbs can be used at night.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Golden geckos need a moderate to high humidity level; aim for 60 to 80 percent relative humidity. As humidity is very important, the best way to measure it is to get a hygrometer and monitor levels daily. Provide humidity with regular misting; the geckos will likely drink from water droplets that collect from the mist.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Golden geckos should be fed a variety of live prey insects. Crickets can make up the main part of the diet, with the addition of waxworms, mealworms, butterworms, roaches, and other pesticide-free, live insect prey. A gecko's prey should be gut loaded prior to feedingand also dusted with a calcium supplement two to three times a week; use a multivitamin dusting once a week as well.</p><p>Feed your golden geckosin the evening. Juveniles should be fed daily but adults do not need to be fed every day. Some keepers recommend randomizing the feeding schedule to keep the geckos interested in their prey. For instance, feed every other day, then feed two days then skip a day, and so on. Feed as much prey at one time as the gecko will eagerly eat.</p><p>Golden geckos will often eat fruit as well. You cantry mashed bananas, pureed baby food, or sliced fruit; goldens especially like tropical fruits such as mangos.</p><p>Provide a small shallow water dish with fresh and clean non-chlorinated water every day. They may use this more for soaking than drinking as golden geckos, like other geckos, prefer to drink water droplets that collect on the surfaces of leaves.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>One of the most common ailments among geckos is a metabolic bone disease (MBD), which is the result of insufficient calcium and vitamin D it the animal's diet. Geckos with MBD will display a poor appetite and tremors and sometimes can suffer painful limb deformities.</p><p>Golden geckos that are undernourished or that live in an enclosure with insufficient humidity often develop a condition called dysecdysis. This condition causes the gecko to have difficulty shedding and can also affect its vision. When it first develops, it looks like a patch of dry or rough skin.</p><p>Like other geckos, goldens are also prone to respiratory infections, including pneumonia. If your gecko is drooling or wheezing or has excess mucus around its nasal passages, these symptoms likely indicate respiratory problems.</p><p>All of these conditions should receive treatment from aveterinarian who specializes in reptiles and especially lizards. Most geckos will recover from the above illnesses if treated in a timely manner.</p><h2>Choosing Your Golden Gecko </h2><p>Golden geckos are usually readily available from breeders since they tend to be lower-profile and less popular compared to leopard geckos or crested geckos. Be wary of wild-caught golden geckos since you don't have any way of knowing their health history or about any parasites they may be carrying. Captive-bred golden geckos tend to be healthier.</p><p>Before you purchase a golden gecko, inspect its skin for any sign of dry patches, which could indicate problems shedding. If possible, arrange to watch the animal eat to ensure it has a healthy appetite.</p>",1062
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/care-of-pet-white-lined-geckos-1238768,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>White-Lined Gecko: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>White-Lined Gecko: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Native to Indonesia, white-lined geckos' bodies are brown, green, or tan. But their namesake comes from the white stripe that starts on each side of the head, converges on the back, and runs down to the tail, which has broad white bands. These geckos also have specialized toe pads that allow them to move effortlessly along vertical surfaces. They're not as temperamental as some other gecko species, so they can be good pets for less-experienced owners who can meet their care needs. However, don't expect a cuddly pet, as handling these nimble animals can be difficult. But once you get their housing set up, their care is fairly simple and straightforward.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: White-lined gecko,white-striped gecko, Indonesian skunk gecko, skunk gecko</p><p>Adult Size: 9 to 10 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 20 years</p><h2>White-Lined Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>White-lined geckos tend to be less aggressive than their close relative, the tokay gecko. However, they still will bite if they feel threatened, and they're quite fast and delicate. Thus, handling them usually isn't recommended unless it's absolutely necessary. These geckos are nocturnal, meaning they're most active at night, and they love to climb. They can be kept with other geckos, but you should never keep two males together. They typically will fight over territorypotentially to the death.</p><h2>Housing the White-Lined Gecko </h2><p>A 20-gallon terrarium is sufficient for a couple of white-lined geckos, but bigger is better because these are active lizards.White-lined geckos need vertical space for climbing, so use a tall tank. A glass terrarium with a screened top or side for ventilation works well. Provide a mix of branches, driftwood, cork bark, bamboo, and vines at varying heights and orientations for climbing. And add a variety of silk and/or sturdy live plants, as the geckos will enjoy hiding in them. In addition, use caves, bark, or other items suitable for hiding spots. Finally, include a small, shallow water dish that you clean and fill with fresh water daily.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Create a daytime temperature gradientbetween roughly 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit for your white-lined gecko. The temperature at night should be between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat lamps or ceramic heat emitters make good heat sources for daytime. At night, red nighttime bulbs or ceramic heat emitters are good options. You can also use under-tank heating.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Never rest a heat source right on the top of the tank, as these climbing geckos might get too close and burn themselves.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>White-lined geckos are nocturnal, so they don't need special UV lighting. However, many experts believeproviding low levels of UV lighting can be beneficial to their overall health. Ensure that the gecko can hide from the light if desired. A red nighttime bulb will allow you to view your gecko when it's most active.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>White-lined geckos need a moderately high humidity level of around 65% to 75%. You should regularly monitor the enclosure's humidity with a hygrometer. Mist the gecko's enclosure a few times a day with warm, filtered water, and make sure the enclosure is well-misted at night when the gecko's activity is highest. White-lined geckos often willdrink from water droplets left from the mist.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>The substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your animal's enclosure. It can provide the look and feel of the gecko's natural environment, and it also should be something that retains moisture to help maintain adequate humidity levels. Some options include coconut fiber bedding, cypress mulch, moss, and peat. You also can use paper or paper towels.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Feed white-lined geckos a diet mainly of crickets. Other insects can be added for variety, including roaches, locusts, cutworms, and silkworms. (Only feed waxworms and mealworms occasionally.) Prey should be about the size of the space between the gecko's eyes.</p><p>Feed your gecko in the evening. Any prey should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious foods) prior to feeding it to your gecko, as well as dusted with a calcium supplement two to three times a week. Also, consider adding a multivitamin once a week, but be sure to consult your veterinarian when adding any supplements to your animal's diet.</p><p>Juveniles should be fed daily, but every other day should suffice for adults. Feed as much prey at one time that the gecko will eagerly eat, and don't leave uneaten crickets roaming around the tank.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>White-lined geckos are prone to stomatitis, or mouth rot, a disease common among gecko species. If infected, they'll likely have a cheese-like ooze (which is actually pus) around their mouth, along with redness. Moreover, if you notice your gecko is drooling, this might be a sign of another common ailment among geckos: a respiratory infection.</p><p>Plus, like other gecko species, white-lined geckos are susceptible to parasitic infections. On the skin, such an infection can look similar to a rash; another symptom is a failure to shed its skin properly. Internal parasites can cause lethargy, changes in appetite, and unusual fecal deposits.</p><p>All of these conditions can be treated if they're caught early enough. Do not attempt to treat these ailments with home remedies; always consult a veterinarian who specializes in lizards.</p><h2>Choosing Your White-LinedGecko </h2><p>Captive-bred geckos are ideal as pets because they're much less likely to have parasites or other health conditions like wild geckos often do. So select a gecko from a reputable breeder or rescue organization that can tell you about the animal's health history, and expect to pay around $15 to $50.</p><p>Look for a gecko with skin that's smooth and free of any bumps (which could indicate an infection or a broken bone). The gecko should have clear eyes and should readily accept food when it is offered. Plus, a healthy white-lined gecko will likely react with displeasure when handled and possibly try to bite you. A gecko that's very lethargic and docile might be sick.</p>",995
24,https://www.thesprucepets.com/long-tailed-lizard-care-1239190,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Long-Tailed Grass Lizard Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Long-Tailed Grass Lizard Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Long-tailed lizards are so named because their tails can easily grow to be four times the length of their bodies. These lizards are native to southeast Asia, China, and southern Russia, occupying open, overgrown, damp grasslands at the edges of forests. They use their long tails for balance and weight distribution while moving swiftly, or ""swimming,"" across the tops of the tall grasses.Long-tailed lizardsmove fast and are extremely agile, but like all reptiles, they enjoy a good long bask in the sun.</p><p>With its dark greenish-brown to brown on their back (to blend in with the grass) and a light, creamy white belly that blends in with the sky when viewed from below, these lizards sport the typical camouflage pattern of an elevation hunter. A brown stripe with a thin white or black border often runs down each side of the long-tailed lizard, though the coloration and stripe patterns can vary. Their gentle, easygoing nature makes them suitable as pet lizards for both novice and experienced owners.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Long-tailed lizard, long-tailed grass lizard, grass lizard</p><p>Adult Size: 10 to 12 inches; tail accounts for up to 4/5 of their total length</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5+ years</p><h2>Long-Tailed Grass Lizard Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>This lizard can usually be housed in small groups of two or three, although males can be territorial and may fight if kept in the same enclosure.Be sure to provide a 10-gallon space for each one of your lizards. You can even house these reptiles with other peaceful species such as anoles and geckos.</p><p>Long-tailed grass lizards have prehensile tails. Like monkeys and lemurs, these lizards can wrap their tails and hang by them if they choose, a fairly unusual trait in the reptile world. Although they can tolerate gentle handling, you should never grab one by the tail as it may detach. Like the gecko, your long-tailed lizard can drop its tail when it feels threatened, and then the tail will regrow. It will take them much longer to regrow their tails than some other, shorter-tailed lizards.</p><h2>Housing the Long-Tailed Grass Lizard </h2><p>A 20-gallon vertical and hexagonal tank is the minimum size requirement for housing a single long-tailed lizard; you'll need an additional ten gallons of enclosure space for each additional lizard (i.e. a 30-gallon tank for three lizards). A screened top should be used but it must be one that is very secure; only a tightly clamped lid will keep these agile lizards from escaping.</p><p>Within the cage, provide a variety of branches, cork bark, sturdy plants (live or silk), and vines to provide lots of hiding spots and climbing space. Since long-tailed grass lizards are so active and quick, the larger the tank is, the more at home they will be.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Although this lizard lives in tall grass in the wild, in a captive enclosure it will spend some time on the floor of the tank (the substrate). Mulch, peat moss, or forest bark type substrates are usually recommendedsince they help to retain humidity. Paper towels or green reptile mats (Astroturf) can also work as a bottom layer as they make for easier cleaning. Sand and wood chips are not recommended due to the potential for accidental ingestion and subsequent impaction.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>To achieve a proper thermal gradient during the day, provide your long-tailed grass lizard with a basking spot between 90 and 95 F; the main enclosure should have an ambient temperature that is between 75 and 85 F. At night, temperatures should fall to be between 65 and 75 F; if it's too much lower, your lizard may become ill from an inability to digest its food.</p><p>Heat lamps with various heat bulbs or ceramic heat elements can be used to provide heat. Under-tank heaters alone may not be sufficient to maintain ambient air temperatures for long-tailed grass lizards as these lizards spend the bulk of their time at elevations that are high off the ground.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Since they are diurnal (day-dwelling), long-tailed grass lizards need exposure to full-spectrum ultraviolet light. Use a UVA and UVB producing bulb that is designed for use with reptiles. Make sure the bulb is close enough to the lizards, but not so close that it can cause burns. Since glass filters out the invisible UV light the lizard needs, the UV bulbs should be placed behind or over the wire mesh lid and not behind glass. At night, use a red or purple night time bulb or ceramic element.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Maintain a humidity level of 70 to 75 percent in the tank at all times; invest in a hygrometer to make sure your humidity level is at the correct level. A shallow water dish will help with humidity but also mist the tank daily with water as many long-tailed grass lizards will only drink from water droplets on the leaves in the tank.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Live crickets can be used as the main diet for long-tailed grass lizards. Supplement with mealworms, waxworms, butter worms, and flies to add variety. Be sure your lizard's prey has been gut-loaded before feeding.</p><p>Adult long-tailed grass lizards can be fed several crickets every other day or so, while juveniles can be fed daily. Once a week, dust the prey items with a vitamin and mineral supplement (including calcium and Vitamin D3).</p><p>A shallow water dish should also be provided for clean, fresh non-chlorinated water. Consider using a reptile drip system (as used for chameleons) which can teach arboreal lizards to drink from a dish. Not only does a dish give you a gauge for how quickly the air is evaporating the water, but the lizard may use the shallow water to bathe in or to aid in defecation.</p><p>Change out this water source daily by removing it from the tank and refilling it. Do not turn it over inside the tank because a soggy spot on the substrate is likely to grow mold.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Wild-caught long-tailed grass lizards are more prone to parasitic infections, but their captive-bred counterparts will sometimes come down with a parasite as well. If you notice sluggishness, a lack of appetite, or vomiting, these symptoms may indicate a parasitic infection. External parasites can also be a problem, with ticks or mites biting the lizard's skin.</p><p>Many breeds of lizard are also susceptible to respiratory infections and the long-tailed grass lizard is no exception. Open-mouth breathing, wheezing, and excess mucus around the nose and mouth are the most common symptoms of a respiratory infection, which is most often caused by improper humidity. The above medical conditions require a visit to a reptile veterinarian for treatment; don't try to treat your fragile lizard at home.</p><h2>Choosing Your Long-Tailed Grass Lizard </h2><p>As with most exotic pets, but especially with lizards, acquire one that has been ""ranched,"" that is, bred in a controlled environment. These are usually easily obtained from reputable breeders. Taking this approach is better than bringing a wild-caught lizard home because you'll have knowledge of its health history; wild animals are exposed to more parasites and other dangers.</p><p>Healthy long-tailed grass lizards have long tails, clear eyes and skin, and very alert personalities. They move fast, especially when feeling startled, so if you encounter a long-tailed lizard that is sluggish, that's a signal that its health is suspect.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Long-Tailed Grass Lizard </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibiansthat can be your pet!</p>",1250
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/colombian-tegus-4046140,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Colombian Tegus</h1>,"<h1>Colombian Tegus</h1><h2>These lizards are strong and can be aggressive</h2><p>Not to be confused with the Argentine black and white tegu, the Colombian tegu is often found in homes of herp lovers across the country. These larger lizards don't make good pets for everyone though so make sure you read up on their care before deciding to get one. With the right care and proper environment, the Colombian tegu can be a rewarding pet reptile.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Colombian Black and White tegu, Colombian teguGolden tegu, Black tegu</p><p>Adult Size:About 3 to 3 1/2 feet long</p><p>Life Expectancy:Up to 20 years</p><h2>Colombian Tegus in the Wild </h2><p>As their name implies, Colombian tegus are from the South American country of Colombia but can also be found throughout the Amazon basin. Their native habitat is hot and humid since they live near the equator and they enjoy eating almost anything they can find including insects and rodents.</p><p>They are quite the scavengers in the wild. They can also be found farther south of the equator where the climate is slightly cooler and burrow their bodies into the soil to cool off on a regular basis. Very little is known about their breeding habits because they are often cooling off underground and hiding in their burrows.</p><h2>Colombian Tegu Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These large reptiles have a reputation of being more aggressive than the similar-looking Argentine black and white tegus, therefore, they don't make good pets for beginner reptile enthusiasts. With regular handling, preferably from a young age, Colombian tegus can be content to hang out with their owners and be carried around but if they are not handled they can be aggressive toward humans.</p><p>Experienced reptile owners that also have a lot of patience to hand tame and time to spend with their Colombian tegu will be rewarded with a friendly reptile pal.</p><p>Ideally, you'll acquire your Colombian tegu at a young age from a private breeder who has been handling their clutches already. Handle your tegu daily, and feed your tegu outside of its regular enclosure so it doesn't associate you with mealtime.</p><h2>Housing Colombian Tegus </h2><p>Since Colombian tegus grow to be over three feet long you will need a large enough enclosure that will not only keep them safe but allows for enough room to burrow, move about, and eat. Most tegu owners end up building their own enclosures using supplies from home improvement stores, purchase large terrariums, or utilize a closet or small bedroom as their tegu's home.</p><p>A minimum of six feet by three feet by three feet is recommended for most Colombian tegus that also get time to exercise outside of their enclosures. Despite the large cage that is needed, keep in mind that Colombian tegus don't require a lot of height in their cages because they don't climb like some reptiles that are similar in size.</p><p>A water dish that allows your Colombian tegu to soak if they so desire should be in their enclosure as well as a place to burrow in their substrate. These areas can be provided by using large plastic containers to aid in cleaning or to allow burrowing you can simply provide a deep layer of soil or bark substrate safe for reptiles.</p><p>A basking area with something to climb on like a branch or shelf will allow your tegu to get closer to the heating elements if they wish or hide under it. At least one hide area should be provided. Try to move things around in the cage on a regular basis to provide mental stimulation and encourage your tegu to move and explore his home.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Offering gut-loaded crickets, mealworms, hornworms, wax worms and cockroaches to your smaller tegu is ideal in addition to some fruit. The insects should always be dusted with a reptile calcium and vitamin D3 supplement to help prevent metabolic bone disease. Some owners use a large plastic storage container to contain the prey items and then put their tegu in that container to eat.</p><p>Larger and full-grown adult tegus may show less interest in the insects they were raised on and should be transitioned to pinkie mice and eventually fuzzies, adult mice, and rats of various sizes.</p><p>Chicks can also be offered if you want to add some variety to your tegu's diet. Occasionally some low-fat ground turkey and a raw egg can be offered as well. Tegus love eggs but these should be reserved as treats.</p><p>Most tegu owners feed their growing lizards several times a week or even daily and then cut back the number of feedings as they reach maturity. Colombian tegus are prone to obesity so monitor their weight once they are full-grown and make sure they have enough time and room to exercise.</p><h2>Heat and Lighting </h2><p>Since Colombian tegus are from a more tropical environment you will need both heat and UVB emitting light bulbs to provide the proper rays to your pet. Use a combination of ceramic heat emitters, basking lights, and full-spectrum lighting that gives off a high percentage of UVB rays to reach a basking temperature of about 100 F.</p><p>The rest of the enclosure should be around 85 F with it not dropping below 75 F at night. Make sure the UVB lighting is not placed on a glass or plexiglass surface as these will block the invisible rays.</p><p>Most manufacturers recommend placing the bulb about 12 inches from your tegu's basking area but be sure to follow the package recommendations and replace the bulb about every 6 months. The lights that emit white light should only be left on for 12 hours a day to allow your tegu to have a proper day and night cycle.</p><p>Use a ceramic heat emitter or night heat light that emits a purple or red glow to heat the enclosure at night.A thermometer should be placed inside the cage (ideally one thermometer on each end of the cage or one that can be moved) to monitor these temperatures in your tegu's home.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Since tegus burrow into the moist soil and live in tropical environments they are used to having high humidity. The large water dish that you have for your tegu to soak in and drink from will help keep the humidity level high but you may also need to mist the enclosure on a daily basis.</p><p>Monitor your tegu's shedding and if it is having problems then it may be an indication that the humidity is not high enough. Placing a hygrometer in the enclosure will allow you to gauge how humid it is.</p><h2>Choosing Your Colombian Tegu </h2><p>As stated earlier, these are not suitable pets for the novice reptile owner. Colombian tegus are strong and can be aggressive, so be sure you're up to the task before taking one in.</p><p>This is definitely a pet you want to acquire from a reputable breeder. A sick tegu may have dry patchy skin, swelling around its nasal passages, and unusual bumps in its limbs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Calcium and phosphorus deficiencies are common in tegus, and like other reptiles, they're susceptible to parasitic infections, respiratory infections, and most seriously, metabolic bone disease.</p><p>This latter ailment is one that usually results in a lack of UVB lighting. Be sure you bring your tegu to a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles if your pet stops eating, seems lethargic, or shows any swelling or dry skin. These are all signs of a sick tegu.</p>",1233
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/argentine-black-and-white-tegus-1239188,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Argentine Black and White Tegus</h1>,"<h1>Argentine Black and White Tegus</h1><h2>These tegus are more gentle than other lizard species</h2><p>Argentine black and white tegus are sometimes simply called black and white tegus, although this can lead to confusion as there is also a Colombian tegu (that looks similar, but is smaller and less docile). Sometimes Argentine tegusare also called giant tegus or big-headed tegus. As itscommon name implies, these lizards hail from Argentina and other parts of South America.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Scientific Name:() </p><p>Common Names: Argentine black and white tegu, black and white tegu</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 4 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 15 years in captivity</p><h2>Behavior and Temperament of Argentine Black and White Tegus </h2><p>Female tegus are slightly smaller than their male counterparts, but both genders have a fairly distinctive pattern of white and black dots and stripes all over their bodies as adults. Their gender can be determined by examining the vent at the base of the tail; males have a bulge but the vent is flat in the female</p><p>Despite theirlarge size compared to other tegus, Argentine black and white tegus enjoy a reputation for being more docile than their smaller counterparts. This is especially true of Argentine tegus that are handled regularly from a young age.</p><h2>Housing Argentine Black and White Tegus </h2><p>Argentine black and white tegus are big and need large and secure enclosures. Juvenile tegus can be kept in a large glass aquarium with a locking lid, but adults will need a larger specialty terrarium or a custom-built cage.</p><p>For adult Argentine tegus, plan on at least a 6-foot by 3-foot by 2-foot enclosure. Double that size for housing more than one. Unlike other lizards, taller cages are not necessary for tegus as they do not stand on their hind legs or climb trees.</p><p>A log or box for hiding should be provided and should contain slightly damp sphagnum moss, to aid with shedding and as a source of humidity for the animal's environment. Chances are your tegu will spend much of its time in this hiding spot.</p><p>Argentine tegus like to burrow, so theyneed a substrate that is not only absorbent and easy to clean but also allows their natural digging behavior. Cypress mulch, orchid bark, or eucalyptus mulch are the preferred substrates for tegus, although some people prefer the convenience of several layers of paper for ease of cleaning (although this can stymie the tegus' natural instinct to dig).</p><p>Avoid wood chips, ground corn cobs, or stone gravel due to the risk of ingestion. You should also avoid indoor/outdoor carpeting since it is likely to get shredded in your Argentine tegu's digging attempts and the stray threads can pose a risk of entangling its nails and toes.</p><h2>Lighting and Heating </h2><p>Argentine black and white tegus are diurnal (active during the day), so they need exposure to full-spectrum UVA, and UVB lighting like the sun provides. They also need a source of heat. While it is true that tegus can tolerate cooler temperatures, for proper health and digestion, daytime temperatures should be between 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, with a basking spot between 100 and 110 degrees F.</p><p>Cooler nighttime temperatures are acceptable but don't allow a drastic change in temperature. Use a combination of reptile heat lamps, bulbs, ceramic heat emitters, and heat mats to reach these high temperatures but avoid hot rocks as they can cause severe burns.</p><p>Tegus have been shown to be one of the few partially endothermic (warm-blooded) lizards, having a body temperature higher than the ambient temperature at nighttime; however, unlike true endotherms such as mammals and birds, these lizards only display temperature control during their reproductive season (September to December).</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Juvenile Argentine tegus can be fed a diet largely composed of gut-loaded crickets dusted with a calcium/vitamin supplement, along with some other feeder insects for variety, such as readily available mealworms and waxworms.</p><p>As your tegu gets older, it can be fed pinkie mice and eventually adult mice, pre-killed or frozen-thawed. But use caution if the mice you are feeding have fur as it may cause intestinal impaction (meaning the tegu can't digest the fur).</p><p>Adult Argentine black and white tegus also can have a variety of fruits and vegetables added to their diets. Canned dog food and eggs can be offered as a very occasional supplement, but be advised that too much protein will cause kidney failure. Be sure to feed your Argentine tegu their mice in a bowl or with tongs to prevent accidentally getting bitten by your hungry lizard.</p><p>Argentine black and white tegus enjoy soaking when they aren't burrowing, so be sure to provide a large shallow water dish that will fit your pet's entire body. Provide fresh water frequently, especially if your tegu defecates in its water.</p><p>Having this large water dish will also help you achieve the ideal 60 to 80 percentrelative humidity in your tegu's environment (a hygrometer will help you monitor the humidity level). Misting the enclosure with water will also aid in keeping the environment the way your tegu likes it.</p><h2>Choosing Your Argentine Black and White Tegu </h2><p>These hardy lizards can become tame pets if handled correctly. But when you're deciding on one, there are a few things to watch out for. This is definitely a pet you want to acquire from a reputable breeder.</p><p>A sick tegu may have dry patchy skin, swelling around its nasal passages or nasal discharge, and unusual bumps in its limbs. If its eyes are cloudy or it seems lethargic, these may be signs of a sick lizard.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Calcium and phosphorous deficiencies can occur in tegus, and like other reptiles, they're susceptible to parasitic infections, which are usually only detected during a fecal exam.</p><p>They're also prone to respiratory infections, which usually happens when there is not enough humidity in the animal's enclosure. If your tegu is drooling or has swelling around its nasal passages and mouth, it may have a respiratory infection.</p><p>The most serious ailment that affects Argentine black and white tegus is a metabolic bone disease. This is the result of a lack of UVB lighting, or lack of calcium and vitamins in the diet. It's painful for the animal and can lead to swelling in the limbs and weakened bones.</p><p>If your pet stops eating, seems lethargic, shows any leg swelling, or continually has dry skin, consult a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. These symptoms are all signs of illness, but are treatable if caught early.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Argentine Black and White Tegu </h2><p>You also can check out our profiles of otherlizard species.</p>",1100
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/tiger-salamanders-1237303,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Tiger Salamander: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Tiger Salamander: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Tiger salamandersare strikingly beautiful animals that are popular exotic pets. They have a fairly long lifespan and usually become quite tame. Native to North America, these amphibians are found in woodlands, as well as in grassy fields, living in underground burrows near bodies of water. The basic coloration of tiger salamanders is yellow blotches, spots, or bars against a black background, though the patterns and intensity of color vary among the subspecies. Plus, they have large eyes, short snouts, thick necks, strong legs, and long tails.As pets, they can be quite lively and entertaining, adapting well to captivity under the right conditions. Once you have their housing set up, the care is fairly straightforward. Expect to spend time each week on feedings, cleaning, and monitoring the humidity and temperature.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Tiger salamander, eastern tiger salamander</p><p>Adult Size:6 to 8 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Tiger Salamander Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Unlike many other salamanders, tiger salamanders are often personable and hardy pets. In time, most tiger salamanders will overcome any fear of humans. And instead they often will follow their keepers' movement from inside their enclosure, as well as reach toward hands offering food. However, they should be handled with care due to their delicate skin.They're not usually aggressive and can be kept with another salamander, though they do not need the company.But it should be noted that they have been known to consume other tiger salamanders, especially when there is a lack of food.</p><h2>Housing the Tiger Salamander </h2><p>The larval stage is entirely aquatic, so these tiger salamanderscan live in an aquarium with 6 inches of water and some rocks to hide in. They should be kept between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 21 degrees Celsius) and not exceeding 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). A good water filter is required, and aeration with an air stone is ideal. Pay particular attention to thewater quality, especially ammonia buildup and the water pH.</p><p>After months to years, the larva will lose its gills and emerge from the water to take on its adult form. As this occurs, gradually reduce the amount of water in the tank, and provide a land area. Once metamorphosis is complete, the salamander can be kept in a terrestrial tank setup. A 10-gallon tank at minimum with a tightly fitting lid that allows airflow should do. One end should have water while the other end should be a raised dry area. When cleaning the tank, only use very hot water and no detergents. Spot clean the tank daily for feces or uneaten food you can remove. And plan to do a full cleaning of the entire environment roughly every two months.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Heating is typically not required, as tiger salamanders should be kept at around 50 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 24 degrees Celsius). Temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) can stress a tiger salamander.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UV lighting is not required, but a regular day-night cycle of around 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness per day should be maintained. Use incandescent lighting, preferably on a timer.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Tiger salamanders prefer a humidity level of around 70%. Maintain this through regular misting, water, and live plants within the tank. Use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material used on the bottom of your pet's enclosure. Not only does it help to mimic a natural environment, but it also increases humidity and allows the salamander to satisfy its burrowing instinct. Provide a substrate at least 4 inches deep that's suitable for burrowing. Anything that maintains some moisture and is gentle on a salamander's skin is fine. Many owners use potting soil (with no vermiculite or chemicals), coconut husk, or sphagnum moss. Gravel is not appropriate, as it's too rough and doesn't stay moist. Also, provide plants, bark pieces, smooth rocks, and other organic materials as hiding places.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Tiger salamanders have a healthy appetite. But they should not be overfed, as they will become obese.The larva eat aquatic invertebrates, such as brine shrimp, insects, small fish, and worms. Adults eat a selection of feeder insects, such as crickets, earthworms, and wax worms. You can also feed them the occasional pinkie mouse and wild-caught insects, as long as you're sure they're from an area that's free of pesticides and other chemicals. Feeding should take place one to three times a week to maintain a healthy body weight. Your veterinarian should advise you on how much and how often to feed your animal, as it can vary based on size and age.</p><p>If your tank doesn't already have a water area, a large dish of dechlorinated water should be provided to adult salamanders. Make sure it's no more than 1 to 2 inches deep. Your salamander might enjoy soaking in the dish, so the water will need regular cleaning.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Tiger salamanders are susceptible to respiratory infections, with symptoms including wheezing and mucus around the nose and mouth. This often results from improper temperatures or moisture levels in their environment. Parasitic infections also are somewhat common in tiger salamanders, especially if their immune system is already fighting another issue. If your tiger salamander seems sluggish or is losing weight, these are sign of a sick salamander; bring it to a veterinarian who specializes in exotic pets.</p><h2>Choosing Your Tiger Salamander </h2><p>As with most exotic pets, it's a bad idea to try to keep a wild salamander in captivity. For one, it might be illegal to take a salamander from the wild where you live. And wild animals often fail to thrive in captivity. Instead, find a reputable breeder or rescue organization. But know that captive-bredtiger salamanders are not widely available because breeding has proven difficult. The seller should be able to give you insight into the animal's health, origin, and personality. Expect to pay around $50.</p><p>As a general rule, avoid purchasing any salamander with dry patches on its skin, as this can indicate a problem with shedding. Plus, look for signs of a respiratory infection, especially excess mucus. A healthy tiger salamander's eyes should be clear and free of any pus, and it should take food readily when it's offered.</p>",1061
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/nile-monitors-1239213,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Nile Monitors</h1>,"<h1>Nile Monitors</h1><p>Nile monitors are occasionally seen in the pet trade but are not typically recommended as petsdue to their large size and agility. Regardless of what kind of a pet they make though, Nile monitors are popular with large lizard lovers because of their swimming and tree-climbing abilities and sheer beauty.</p><h2>Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Nilemonitors can thrive in captivity but aren't always the friendliest as pets. If raised from a very young age and handled regularly, you may be able to trust your monitor a little bit but more often than not they aren't very tame or trustworthy. These reptiles are strong, can be aggressive, and are large.</p><p>From the in 1995: ""There are few of these lizards less suited to life in captivity than the Nile monitor. Buffrenil (1992) considered that, when fighting for its life, a Nile Monitor was a more dangerous adversary than a crocodile of a similar size. Their care presents particular problems on account of the lizards' enormous size and lively dispositions. Very few of the people who buy brightly-colored baby Nile Monitors can be aware that, within a couple of years, their purchase will have turned into an enormous, ferocious carnivore, quite capable of breaking the family cat's neck with a single snap and swallowing it whole.""</p><p>Most Nile monitors resist attempts to tame them, keeping their aggressive personalities through adulthood. When they are young, Nile monitors will whip their tails if they feel threatened. Nile monitors will not hesitate to bite if they are stressed, and given their size, this is not pleasant. These pets are unsuitable for homes with small children, due to the animal's temperament and size.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Nile monitors have voracious appetites. In the wild, they feed on a variety of prey items including fish, eggs, insects, rodents, birds, and even other reptiles such as snakes. As pets, Nile monitors are usually fed insects (like crickets since they are readily accessible from pet stores) when they are young and pre-killed rodents like mice and rats as they get larger.</p><p>Wild Nile monitors eat live prey items but it is not recommended to feed live mice or rats to a pet Nile monitor due to the risk of the prey biting your lizard. Monitors that have especially large enclosures with numerous hiding spots may be at less of a risk for injuries from their food but the potential for bites is still there.</p><p>Gut-loading crickets and dusting themwith calcium powder before feeding your Nile monitor is vital for a growing reptile but if you are feeding whole mice or rats it is not necessary to add anything to them.</p><p>Juveniles should be fed daily and adults should be offered food a few times a week. Obesity can be an issue in adults who don't get enough exercise though sobe careful you are not overfeeding your monitor. When considering how much an adult monitor eats in a week (several large rats) you can see how expensive owning a Nile monitor will get.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Of course, bigger is always better when it comes to reptile housing and this isespecially true for a monitor that likes to climb, swim, run, and can grow to be nine feet long. At the bare minimum, your enclosure for a Nile monitor should be twice as long as your full-grown lizard. This means your six-foot monitor would have an enclosure that is 12 feet long.</p><p>The housing also needs to be secure enough to prevent a monitor from escaping by burrowing under a fence or climbing out. A large water source, preferably one that your monitor can swim around in, is required along with something to climb on and hide in.</p><p>An entire bedroom in a house is often used or secure, custom-made, outdoor enclosures are great seasonally to provide natural sunlight.</p><h2>Heating and Lighting </h2><p>Nile monitors are native to Africa (although an invasive population is thriving in Florida) where the weather is hot. A basking spot temperature should reach 120 F with a temperature gradient down to the 80s during the day and not drop below 80 at night.</p><p>A Nile monitor also requires UVB lighting. This light should be on a 12-hour cycle and the bulb should be replaced every 6 months, even if it doesn't burn out (unless the manufacturer guarantees it to last longer). The invisible UVB rays eventually run out from these bulbs and you are left with nothing more than a fluorescent bulb emitting white light. If your Nile monitor lives outside year-round and gets natural sunlight this light is not necessary.</p><h2>Choosing Your Nile Monitor </h2><p>Nile monitorsare beautiful, large, strong, and aggressive reptiles. They do not make good pets but are hardy nonetheless. If you are consideringgetting apetNile monitor make sure you have a large and safe enclosure.</p><p>You should also make sure you have the regular funding to pay for all the food it will eat over the next 20 years, check to seeif it is legal to own a Nile monitorwhere you live and if a vet near youis willing and knowledgeable to treat such a pet.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Monitor lizards are susceptible to metabolic bone disease, the result of a diet that lacks calcium. It can also occur if the lizard is not getting enough UVB lighting.</p><p>These lizards are not as prone to parasitic infections as other breeds but can suffer from constipation due to impaction. They eat a lot and sometimes ingest sand or other things they can't digest.</p><p>If you suspect your Nile monitor has one of these conditions, you should seek treatment from a veterinarian who specializes in lizards.</p>",938

It is generally docile, relatively easy to care for, and does not get very large; it's a great choice especially for beginner snake owners.However, these reptiles are also favorites of even experienced keepers due to the array of beautiful colors and patterns selective, captive breeding has produced. Closely related to the rat snakes (as cousins in the genuscorn snakes are sometimescalled redrat snakes. Theyare native to the southeastern United States, are mostlyland-dwelling, andare active mainly at dusk and dawn.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Corn snake,red rat snake</p><p>Adult Size:2.5 to 4 feet long on average; occasionally up to 6 feet long</p><p>Life Expectancy:15 to 20 years</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Low-Key Corn Snake</h3><h2>Corn Snake Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These low-key snakes allow people to handle themand are generally docile. But when they feel threatened, especially in the wild, they may vibrate their tails as a defense mechanism, similarly to rattlesnakes.</p><p>Like most snakes, corn and rat snakes are unrivaled escape artists. They will push at the lid with their noses looking for weaknesses and tiny openings, so the fit of the lid is very important. If a snake gets out of its cage it can get lost or hurt. An escaped snake is also likely to give your household visitors a good scare.</p><h2>Housing the Corn Snake </h2><p>A 20-gallon long glass tank (alonger and shallower version of the20-gallontank) makes a good-sized enclosure for a corn snake. It is important to use a secure-fitting lid that can be clamped down from the top.</p><p>In order to feel safe, corn snakes need places to hide.Provide a hide box (any closed-in container like an upside-down cardboard box) that is just large enough for the snake to curl up in; if it is too large the snake will not feel as secure. Pieces of bark can also provide hiding spots for your snake if they are atop a substrate that allows burrowing under the bark. Ideally, there should be an available hiding place in both the cooler and warmer ends of the enclosure. Also, provide a forked branch for climbing.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Maintaining your corn snake'shome at the correct temperature is vital. An overhead incandescent heat lamp is the preferred method of heating, but corn snakes are from temperate climates, so they do not need tropical temperatures. Keep an ambient temperature of 80 to 85 F. A basking site should be 85 to 88 F.At night, the temperature should drop only as low as 75 F. Under tank heating pads or heat tape can be used, but they can make it difficult to monitor how hot the enclosure is, so use thermometers inside.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Luckily, corn snakes prefer the humidity found in a typical household. Between 35 and 60 percent is a good range for the ambient air in the enclosure: the higher end of this range will promote healthy shedding. Monitor your corn snake enclosure with a hygrometer, especially in the dryer winter months; you may need to mist the tank or refill an evaporating water bowl more frequently.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>These snakes like to burrow and hide, so using a layer of loose substrate (floor lining) on the bottom of the enclosure is key. A variety of materials can be used asa bottom layerfor the enclosure.Inkless newspaperis the utilitarian choice since it is very easy to clean up, but its appearanceinthe cage leaves a little to be desired. Indoor/outdoor carpeting (""Astroturf"") can be used, and if you cut two pieces, you can rotate them by swapping the clean one out for the dirty one at cleaning time; wash and thoroughly dry the soiled piece before using it.</p><p>For the top layer, aspen shavings can be used. The chips that are soiled with feces can simply be scooped out; clean and refresh shavingsas needed. Move the snake to a separate container for feeding so that the shavings are not inadvertently ingested. Do not use pine or cedar shavings because the aromatic oils can cause irritation and respiratory issues in your reptile pet. Sand, soil, and corncob are also not good choices as substrates for corn snakes.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Corn snakes are carnivores. In the wild, they stalk their prey primarily via smell rather than sight. Captive corn snakes should be fed pre-killed frozen mice that are properly thawed.Hatchlings are started out on pinkie mice for feedings, and the size of the prey should be increased as the snake grows. The prey item can be as wide or a little wider than the snake's head.</p><p>Feed growing snakes twice per week; adults need only be fed one appropriately sized prey item every week or two. Your snake'sappetite might decline around the time of a shed, so reduce feeding frequency if your snake is about to start shedding, evidenced by cloudy eyes and dulling of the skin color.</p><p>As corn snakes do drink water by absorbing it through their mouths, a water dish is also necessary; it's important to keep the water meticulously clean. Snakes often use their water to aid them in defecation; when this happens, dump the dish, and clean and refill immediately. A heavy shallow dish several inches in diameter makes a good water source. You may even find your snake soaking in the dish, particularly before a shed. Use non-chlorinated water whenever possible.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Mouth rot, or infectious stomatitis, is a bacterial infection of the mouth that often causes saliva bubbles as well as inflammation in and around the mouth. If left untreated, this ailment can cause infection in the bone, and the snake's teeth may be lost.A toothless snake will not be able to eat correctly.</p><p>As with most snake breeds, corn snakes are susceptible to fungal disease and respiratory infections. Fungal infection is marked by discoloration of the skin. A sign of respiratory infection is open-mouth breathing or wheezing. All of these health issues require treatment by an exotic animal veterinarian who has expertise in reptiles.</p><h2>Choosing Your Corn Snake </h2><p>When choosing a snake, a captive-bred specimen is the best choice. One shouldn't be difficult to find since corn snakes breed fairly readily in captivity. Look for a snake that doesn't have any retained skin from a shed. Choose a snake with clear eyes, no cuts or scrapes, and no mites or ticks. Also, a clean cloacal vent, an alert head, and mouth with a pink tongue and small amount of clear saliva are all good signs of health.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Corn Snake </h2><p>Due to its brownish-orange coloring, the corn snake is often mistaken for the venomous copperhead snake (), but the two species share few attributes other than color. Copperheads have sideways hourglass markings on the back; from the side, they look like a line of Hershey Kisses chocolates.</p><p>If you're interested in other snakes similar to the corn snake, check out:</p>",1179

They will live 20 to 30+ years in captivity if well cared for and are big snakes for the average pet owner. Red tail boas need to be seriously considered before being purchased due to their strength, size, the amount they eat, and their ability to constrict. They are not legal to own everywhere so be sure to check your local laws as well.</p><p>The reason red tail boas are so popular is due in part to their typically docile temperament. They aren't usually aggressive snakes but even if they aren't upset they can do damage to a person quite easily by constricting (to hang on to someone's hand, neck, or arm) or biting youif they think your hand is food.</p><h2>Housing Red Tail Boas </h2><p>A 11-foot snake needs a little room to move about and stretch out fully. While snakes feel secure when they are hiding under something and are able to curl up, they should also be able to fully stretch out end to end without touching the sides. An enclosure that provides a minimum of 10 feet of floor space, is a couple of feet high, and a couple of feet wide is sufficient for an adult red tail boa.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing about anenclosure for a red tail boa is how secure it needs to be. All snakes are escape artists and will push through unlocked lids and squeeze through small openings. All snake enclosures should have locks or latches to prevent an escape, which can be dangerous to both the snake and the people living in the house. Placing a red tail boa inside a tied pillowcase works well for transporting or to temporarily hold them while cleaning their enclosure.</p><p>Since red tail boascome from a tropical environment, the ease of maintaining humidity levels should be taken into consideration when setting up a cage. Glass or plexiglass sides and lids help to keep humidity higher (needs to be 60-80%) in an enclosure but you will want to make sure enough air is still able to circulate inside and that nothing will melt from the heating devices.</p><p>Your snake needs a large, sturdy bowl for water. Itshould be able to easily fit its entire body in the bowl to soak. Red tail boas should also have a hide box or place to escape the heat and to curl up in a quiet, hidden place whenever they want to. Many owners use wooden or cardboard boxes for hides and replace or clean them as needed. Tree branches may or may not be used by your snake.</p><p>The kind of bedding you choose should be easy to clean since a large snake produces quite a large amount of waste material. Paper towels are great for young red tail boas and reptile cage carpetor indoor/outdoor carpet cut into removable sections are easy to clean when you have anadult snake. Other materials that are often used includereptile bark, reptile dirt mixtures, and other natural floor coverings. Sand is not appropriate for red tail boas; they may ingest it causing a digestive impaction.</p><h2>Lighting and Heating </h2><p>Since red tail boas are from Brazilthey like their environments warm. A basking spot of around 90 -92 degreesFahrenheit should be maintained using heat lights or other means. But avoid using hot rocks because they can cause thermal burns in a snake. The rest of the tank can be in the mid-80s and at night it's safe for the temperature drops into the lower 80's but not required. You can use either a thermostat or thermal temperature gun to monitor temperatures in your snakes environment.</p><p>Heat lights, ceramic heat emitters, under tank heaters, and incubator cages are all acceptable means of heating a snake cage. Just make sure your snake cannot get to the heating element and burn itself.</p><p>UVB lighting is not mandatory for red tail boas, but if you want to offer supplemental white light during the day, a UVB light is a great option. It may even help stimulate appetite, decrease stress and make your snake an overall happier, more active snake.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Juvenile red tail boas will eatfuzzies, then mice, then rats, and once they reach adulthood, they will be eating rabbits and large rats. When 3 feet in length, they can eat small rats and once 5-7 feet, they are now able to move up in size of prey to large rats. Prey items should be killed prior to feeding them to your snake and offered in an enclosure used only for feeding.</p><p>Do not feed your snake in its regular cage; this will decrease the likelihood of the snake thinking you are food and accidentally biting you or ingesting its substrate. The feeding tank should be covered with a towel while feeding to provide a sense of security to your snake, or you can place your snake's hide box in the feeding tank while feeding.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The most serious disease that can affect boa constrictors is inclusion body disease or IBD. This is a fatal retrovirus, akin to HIV in humans. This virus can lay dormant for years before the snake shows any sign of illness. This disease can be transmitted from snake to snake via direct contact, indirectly in the air, and via mites, which carry infected bodily fluids. This is why it's a good idea to keep multiple pet snakes separated if possible.</p><p>IBD is marked by poor appetite and excessive saliva, and in serious or more advanced cases, IBD causes snakes to lose control of their bodily movements.</p><p>Red tail boas also are susceptible to respiratory infections, marked by wheezing and nasal discharge. A foamy discharge from a snake's mouth usually indicates pneumonia, which requires immediate treatment.</p><p>Scale rot and blister disease are both common in boa constrictors, with both usually caused by unsanitary conditions. Blister disease may appear like burns on the snake's skin and is usually caused by overheated cages or a lack of humidity.</p><p>All of these ailments should receive treatment from a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p><h2>Choosing a Red Tail Boa </h2><p>Red tailboas are large, strong, long-lived snakes and aren't for everyone. Feeding them can become more expensive as they get larger, and so will the time it takes to clean their cage. Therefore, make sure you are prepared and know what to expect before taking home any pet, especially one that lives up to 30 years.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Red Tail Boa </h2><p>You also may want to check out all of our other snake breedprofiles.</p><p>Large Constrictor Snake Final Rule.</p><p>Lighting Requirements for Reptiles.</p>",1250
31,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hognose-snakes-species-profile-5226049,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Hognose Snake: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Hognose Snake: Species Profile</h1><p>Despite the fact that the word ""hognose"" can encompass several different species of snakes, all hognose snakes are known for their characteristic upturned snouts. is the most commonly kept pet hognose snake and because they are relatively small when compared to many other pet snakes, they are a popular alternative to a ball python or corn snake. Knowing how to properly care for a hognose snake will help it thrive and provide you with years of companionship and enjoyment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Western hognose snake, hognose snake, hog-nose snake, North American hog-nosed snake, blow snake, bluffer, faux viper, plains hognose snake, prairie hognose snake, spoonbill snake, spreadhead snake, Texas hognose snake, Texas rooter</p><p>Adult Size:Up to three feet long with males being smaller than females</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 18 years</p><h2>Hognose Snake Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Hognose snakes are known for their array of defensive behaviors but are otherwise considered fairly docile as pets and can even be great for kids. These small snakes are active during the day and if they feel threatened, you may even hear them make a hissing noise. Other defensive behaviors that may be observed include the flattening of the body to appear wider and larger, the compression of the neck to give the deceptive appearance that they have a ""hood"" like that of a cobra, and they may even play dead. Playing dead involves the hognose snake flipping over on its back with its mouth agape and tongue hanging out. It may even release a foul-smelling odor while it's pretending to die. These little upturned-snout snakes may occasionally strike if it is frightened, but it just strikes with its snout, not its teeth, so there is very little concern if you do get a hognose snake bite.</p><h2>Housing the Hognose Snake </h2><p>Because a hognose snake is not a very large reptile, its enclosure does not have to be very large, either. A 20-gallon long tank will provide ample floor space for an adult hognose snake; they just need room to slither and burrow, so consider a 40-gallon tank to give them extra space. They don't climb, so you may not think you need a lid on the tank, but you should always make sure your snake's enclosure is secure. A screen top is a must.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Unlike some other reptiles, hognose snakes burrow so that means that their heat source needs to be on the ground level. Under tank heaters can be utilized to provide heat by being placed on one side of the tank to create a thermal gradient. These can also heat up the glass of the tank, so be sure your reptile has no ability to burrow down to the level of the glass and experience a thermal burn. An alternative to a reptile-specific under tank heating pad is to use a heat-producing bulb to achieve a temperature of about 90 degrees, but you should never use a hot rock. Hot rocks can easily cause thermal burns and should be avoided. A cool side should be provided which should remain in the high 70's.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Hognose snakes are diurnal, so it is important to provide them with adequate white light each day. A full-spectrum light should be used for about 12 hours a day to mimic the normal day/night cycle your snake would experience in the wild. Be sure to follow the instructions on the specific light you purchase regarding the placement of the bulb as well as the expiration.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>A semi-arid environment is ideal for a hognose snake, so it does not require a high level of humidity. Aim for about 30% humidity in your enclosure, but be sure not to get below 20% or above 50%. A hygrometer can be purchased and used to monitor these levels.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Bedding or substrate for an adult hognose snake can be a variety of things, but you want it to allow your snake to burrow and be non-toxic. Shredded or various recycled newspaper and other paper beddings and aspen shavings are the best options and can easily be spot cleaned as needed. Sand and crushed walnut shells should be avoided as they may contribute to an impaction.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Hognose snakes don't swim, but they do not have access to fresh water at all times. A shallow bowl of water should be placed in your snake's enclosure and changed out at least once a week. If your snake gets the water dirty, be sure to change it as soon as possible. Additionally, a water bowl large enough for them to fit into should be provided if your animal wants to soak.</p><p>Meals for hognose snakes consist primarily of small mice. Depending on the size of your snake, pre-killed pinky, fuzzy, or adult feeder mice should be offered about once a week if it is an adult or every three to five days if it is a juvenile. Use the size of your snake's head to determine an appropriately sized meal. If the prey item is wider than your snake's head, it is too large.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>There are not any health problems that are specific to hognose snakes, but snakes in general can develop a few types of issues. Mouth rot, skin wounds, respiratory infections, skin infections, dysecdysis (or retained shed), and parasites are the most common health problems that affect snakes. A veterinarian that is comfortable treating reptiles may be needed for some health problems, but most issues can be avoided by providing your hognose with an ideal environment. Hognose snakes can be finicky when it comes to eating in captivity; some owners recommend using froglinks to entice your hognose to eat if they refuse food.</p><h2>Choosing Your Hognose Snake </h2><p>First and foremost, you should only purchase a captive-bred hognose snake. Wild-caught snakes can not only be illegal, but they can also harbor more parasites and experience more stress in a captive environment than those that were bred to be pets. There are various breeders as well as pet stores and rescue groups that sell or adopt out hognoses. Be sure to ask about the snake's origins before adopting it.</p><p>Purchasing a hatchling will almost always ensure you are getting a captive-bred snake, but regardless of its age, you should also ask what and how often the snake is eating. You should also find out the last time it ate and defecated and examine its skin for any signs of parasites, injuries, or infection. Your snake should have open, alert eyes, its ribs should not be visible, and there should be no retained skin.</p><p>Reptile expos and online breeder sites are the most popular sources for purchasing a hognose snake, and you should expect to pay at least a couple of hundred dollars for a traditionally colored hognose snake. Some rare color morphs may cost over $1,000, so be prepared to invest a substantial sum if you want a uniquely colored hognose.</p>",1160
32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rat-snakes-1239229,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Black Rat Snake: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Black Rat Snake: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Rat snakes are among the most popular pet snakes. And after the corn snake, the black rat snake is the member of this snake family that you'll most often find as a pet. Black rat snakes are found in the central portion of North America, and in the wild they're sometimes mistaken for rattlesnakes. However, they are not venomous and in fact are rather shy and docile. They have shiny black backs with lighter bellies and white on their throat. Their smaller size and less demanding temperature requirements compared to many other snakes make black rat snakes popular pets both among first-time snake owners and experienced handlers.They won't be the most cuddly pets, but they can learn to feel comfortable while being handled.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black rat snake, western rat snake, pilot black snake, black snake</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 6 feet long</p><p>Lifespan: 10 to 30 years in captivity</p><h2>Black Rat Snake Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The black rat snake might be mistaken for a rattlesnake because it wrinkles up its body and freezes before striking its prey or when it feels threatened. This snake also might vibrate its tail like a rattlesnake when threatened. And it can emit a musky odor that's intended to deter a predator. Moreover, black rat snakes will use their strong, agile bodies to stand their ground and strike when provoked, such as when they're under attack from a predator in the wild. However, they more commonly flee from confrontation. Around people, black rat snakes are typically pretty calm and not aggressive if they are handled regularly.</p><h2>Housing the Black Rat Snake </h2><p>Because rat snakes are good climbers, maintaining an extra secure enclosure is key to keeping your snake in its home. A solid latch is necessary to any black rat snake house, as well as some height to the cage to allow your snake climbing room. A 30- to 40-gallon tank is suitable, though the larger (and taller) the better. A water bowl large enough for your snake to fit in to allow a good soaking should be provided at all times.</p><p>Rat snakes are hardy snakes and don't require much maintenance once their cage is set up. Cleaning their cage as needed and keeping their water bowl fresh will be your main duties besides feeding.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Rat snakes prefercooler temperatures than some other snakes. But to stop them from hibernating you should keep their enclosurebetween 80 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit, with a minimum temperature of 70 degreesFahrenheit at night. Special reptile heat lights should be used to maintain these temperatures.</p><p>Don't use hot rocks, as they can be dangerous and burn your snake. Under-tank heaters also are not recommended because they make it difficult to regulate the ambient temperature. Ceramic heat emitters and incandescent heat light bulbs are preferred.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Unlike many other snake species, ultraviolet (UVB) lighting is not necessary for black rat snakes. If you're using any heat lights that emit a visible white light, these should be placed on a timer or turned on and off every 10 to 12 hours to replicate the natural day-night cycle.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Black rat snakes prefer a moderate humidity level of around 35% to 60%. The humidity should be on the higher end during shedding. Monitor humidity with a hygrometer, and increase it with misting or a bowl of water if necessary.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>In the wild, black rat snakes spend most of their time in heavily wooded areas, so a substratethe material on the bottom of the enclosurethat reflects this natural environment is recommended. The substrate will help to maintain humidity and satisfy the snake's natural burrowing instinct. Newspapers are an inexpensive and popular substrate material. A piece of reptile carpet also can be used. Plus, pine bark chips or aspen shavings are other materials that work well, and they can be scooped out when soiled (much like cat litter in a litter box).</p><p>Sand is not a good substate option because the snake can inhale it, causing respiratory problems. You also should avoid using pine shavings or cedar shavings, as the strong aromas can irritate your snake's sensitive respiratory system.</p><p>Be sure to thoroughly wash and dry any substrate material you plan to reuse before putting it back into your snake's enclosure. Poor husbandry is a major cause of illness among captive snakes.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Rat snakes are constricting snakes, which meansthey wrap their bodies around their food before eating it to suffocate the prey. In thewildthey catch and kill live rodents. But incaptivitythey will eatpre-killed prey, which is a much safer option. Live prey can bite or otherwise injure a snake, especially if the snake isn't interested in eating it right away.</p><p>Mice and rats are theprey of choice for pet rat snakes,as they are readily available from many pet stores and can be ordered frozen in bulk online. Feeding an adult rat snake once a weekis a good starting point, but this will vary depending on the size of the food and the size of your snake. Like other snakes, rat snakes generally won't eat if they are about to shed or are currently shedding.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Black rat snakes are generally docile and easy to manage behaviorally if you handle them often. But in terms of their health, these snakes are prone to mouth rot, or infectious stomatitis. This painful bacterial infection of the mouth displays as saliva bubbles, as well as inflammation in and around the snake's mouth. It's imperative to treat mouth rot; an advanced infection can cause the snake's teeth to fall out.</p><p>Black rat snakes also are susceptible to fungal and respiratory infections. If your snake is breathing with its mouth open or is wheezing, these are signs of a respiratory problem. Discolored skin indicates a possible fungal infection.</p><p>All of the above are conditions that require treatment by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p><h2>Choosing Your Black Rat Snake </h2><p>To ensure you're getting a healthy snake, you should obtain one from a reputable reptile breeder who often charges around $50 to $100 for this species. It's not advised to take in a wild snake. This might not be legal in your area, you have no way of knowing its health history, and the animal is unlikely to thrive for very long.</p><p>A healthy black rat snake won't have excess skin (which can indicate an unsuccessful shedding). It should have clear eyes (cloudy eyes are a sign of illness) and no skin discoloration or cuts (which are potential signs of mites, ticks, or injuries). Also, it should be alert and flicking its tongue.</p><p>A lethargic snake is not a healthy snake, though some black rat snakes might try to hide if they're feeling nervous which is normal behavior.</p>",1143
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/central-american-boa-4165404,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Central American Boa Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Central American Boa Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Often confused with the red-tailed boa, the Central American boa is actually a different species of snake that doesn't grow to be quite as long. It has very similar needs to other snakes from Central and South America, is non-venomous, and a common snake found in the pet industry. Knowing the specific care a Central American boa needs can help keep it healthy and therefore maximize its lifespan.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s):Central American Boa, Common Boa, Dwarf Boa</p><p>Adult Size:5-8 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20-30 years</p><h2>Central American Boa Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These patterned snakes are happy living alone and are crepuscular. This means they are most active at sunrise and sunset but they may also be caught basking under their heat light from time to time. They spend most of their time on the ground, but when they are younger and not so heavy, they will climb trees and bushes. Like most snakes, they may strike if they are scared or threatened but the Central American boa is not typically considered an aggressive species. They are usually calm and make for easy handling.</p><h2>Housing the Central American Boa </h2><p>Central American boas are native to Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela. Here they prefer tropical rainforest climates so their housing in captivity should mimic this as closely as possible.</p><p>A large enclosure with a secure lid is a must for a Central American Boa. A glass terrarium or aquarium can be used for young boas but as your snake grows, a larger enclosure will be needed. Ideally the cage should be the length of your snake when it is full grown so that it can try to stretch out fully. Special reptile enclosures are typically recommended due to the size needed for an adult boa.</p><p>Spot cleaning your boa's enclosure should be performed on a regular basis but a full change of the substrate should be done as needed. Snakes are not dirty pets but if you feed your snake in its enclosure then it will need to be cleaned more often.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Since Central American boas need supplemental heat to regulate their internal body temperatures, heat lights are necessary for your snake. Ceramic base heat lights should be used with heat lights or ceramic heat emitters to provide a basking area of about 90 degrees. Your snake should not be able to come into contact with the light to avoid thermal burns and hot rocks are not recommended for the same reason. The cooler side of the enclosure should not be allowed to drop below 75 degrees so heating elements should be placed to provide this appropriate thermal gradient where your snake sits. Various types of thermometers are available to help monitor these temperatures and should be located at the same level as your snake.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>White light from a heat light or fluorescent bulb should be available for a 12-hour cycle to mimic outdoor conditions. UVB lighting is beneficial but not necessary for most snakes. A regular fluorescent or incandescent bulb that emits white light is adequate to simulate this daily cycle and provide lighting for your snake's enclosure.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Humidity does not need to be high unless your snake is shedding. Fifty percent relative humidity, measured with a hygrometer placed in the enclosure, is acceptable under normal circumstances but should be increased to 70% at the time of a shed. This can be done by placing larger or more water bowls in the enclosure, misting it with a spray bottle, or placing wet moss in a hide box.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate or bedding should be placed on the bottom of the enclosure. A two-inch layer is ideal to allow your snake to comfortably move about and even burrow in a little. Aspen shavings, shredded paper material, or reptile dirt are popular options. Pine and cedar shavings or wood chips should be avoided as these contain oils that can be irritating to your snake.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>A large water dish should be provided to allow your snake to soak and will also double as a source of humidity. This should be changed regularly. Pre-killed prey should ideally be fed in a separate container, such as a large plastic storage container, so your snake does not associate you reaching into its enclosure with food. This will decrease the likelihood of being bitten and also help to keep its enclosure clean.</p><p>Central American boas typically eat frozen, thawed, or live fuzzy mice, but some may be large enough to eat a small frozen, thawed adult mouse. Young snakes only need to eat once a week and adult snakes are usually fed once or twice a month and even less as they age.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Reptiles that get too cold or don't have enough humidity are likely to get sick and have problems shedding. Respiratory illnesses and dysecdysis are common problems that are usually easily prevented by having an appropriate environment for your boa. Other issues can include impaction if your snake ingests its bedding, mouth rot, and various internal and external parasites from the rodents they eat, the bedding they are in, or from being outside. Central American boas may not need veterinary care as often as a dog or cat but a regular physical examination is always a good thing to help catch any small problems before they become a major issue.</p><h2>Choosing Your Central American Boa </h2><p>When purchasing a Central American boa, first and foremost, make sure it is a captive-bred snake. This will help decrease the likelihood of parasite issues. Your snake should not have any wounds or lesions, be well muscled and smooth, and have no signs of mouth rot. Be sure to ask what the snake has been eating as well as when the last meal was consumed.</p><p>Reputable breeders typically charge between $100 and $150 for a baby Central American boa but more exotic or rare morph patterns and colors may cost more. In addition to the cost of the snake, online purchases will also have shipping fees but some pet stores and reptile shows or expos may also have Central American boas available for in-person purchasing. Snakes that have no feeding records, signs of illness, or have been wild-caught are not ideal purchases.</p>",1090

They're found in North America, South America, and Madagascar. These animals are fairly small and generally have thick bodies and round eyes.</p><p>They're often kept in homes as pet snakes. Hognose snakes tend to be timid, preferring to hide from predators in the wild rather than attack. Likewise, in captivity, they rarely turn aggressive.They are relatively easy to maintain once you have their housing and feeding routine down.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Hognose snake</p><p>Scientific Name: ,,</p><p>Adult Size:Less than 2 feet long on average; some can reach 4 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years; up to 20 years in captivity</p><h2>Hognose Snake Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Hognose snakes are diurnal animals(active during the day), and they are known for their docile nature. In fact, the eastern hognose () is especially well known for its habit of playing dead around predators. When hognose snakes feel threatened, they might flatten their necks, raise their heads, and occasionally strike but rarely bite. But if they're handled regularly from a young age, they can grow up to be fairly calm around people.</p><p>There's ongoing debate in herpetological circles about whether hognose snakes should be classified as venomous. Technically, they do secrete venom in their saliva that is lethal to small prey animals, but it's harmless to humans. And because hognose snakes don't typically bite, it's unlikely that a human would come in contact with the venom anyway.For these reasons, most snake experts don't consider hognose species to be on the same level as poisonous snakes, such as rattlesnakes and cobras.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Small and Distinct Hognose Snake</h3><h2>Housing the Hognose Snake </h2><p>Hognose snakesdon't grow very large, and a tank that allows them to stretch the entire length of their body will suffice. A 20-gallon tank is often a good size for one snake, depending on how large your animal grows. Prioritize floor space over height, as these snakes don't typically climb. But a secure lid is still recommended to keep your snake safe in its enclosure. Provide a water dish that's big enough for your snake to climb into, as well as a hide box where it can go to feel secure.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Within the enclosure, provide a temperature gradient with a basking area at around 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit and a cool side that doesn't drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. To achieve these temperatures, you might need to experiment with different wattages of heat bulbs at varying heights. For an accurate reading, remember to measure the temperature at the level of your snake in the enclosure, not at the top of the tank.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Many owners opt to provide full-spectrum UVB lights on a 12-hour cycle in the snake's enclosure to mimic the natural day-night cycle. This isn't absolutely essential, as these snakes get most of their vitamin D from their diet. But the lighting can help their bodies produce vitamin D, ensuring that they don't become deficient.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Hognose snakes need a humidity level from roughly 40 to 70 percent. The level varies slightly among the species, and the snakes tend to prefer a little higher humidity when they're about to shed. The water dish in the enclosure will provide humidity, but you also can lightly mist the enclosure if you need to raise the humidity level. Monitor the humidity with a reptile hygrometer.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Hognose snakes have unique snouts that act like little shovels. In the wild, they use their noses to burrow into the ground. In captivity, it's ideal to provide them with a few inches of sand mixed with reptile-safe soil or another material that allows the snake to burrow and hide.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Hognose snakes, especially , can be difficult to feed in captivity and might refuse food. In addition to staying consistent with what and when you feed them, make sure the enclosure temperatures are correct. Snakes need warmth to remain active and properly digest their food. And there's little doubt when hognose snakes are hungry. They'll often approach their feeder with an open mouth, ready for their food.</p><p>Hognoses will start out eating gut-loaded crickets (crickets fed nutritious foods) dusted with calcium powder. As they mature, they'll graduate to pinkies, fuzzies, and possibly adult mice, depending on how large the species grows. Young hognose snakes need to be fed a few times a week, and fully grown snakes typically do fine being fed one prey item a week. If you notice your snake is about to begin shedding, it's sometimes wise to reduce feedings to prevent regurgitation.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Despite their timid nature, hognose snakes are a hardy breed that doesn't often get sick. But there are a few diseases to watch out for.</p><p>Like most reptiles, hognose snakes are susceptible to respiratory infections, which show symptoms of wheezing, drooling, and general lethargy. It's believed that improper humidity is usually the reason for recurring respiratory infections in snakes.</p><p>Another ailment that afflicts snakes is mouth rot, or infectious stomatitis. If you spot saliva bubbles and inflammation around your snake's mouth, those are classic symptoms of mouth rot. It's a painful condition, and if left untreated it can cause an infection that makes your snake's teeth fall out.</p><p>Hognose snakes also are prone to fungal infections, which can cause problems shedding and discoloration of the skin.All of these conditions should receive attention from a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p><h2>Choosing Your Hognose Snake </h2><p>Ideally, you'll want to get a captive-bred hognose snake from a reputable breeder or rescue organization that can answer questions about the snake's health history.Make sure to ask what the snake has been eating, how often it usually eats, and the last time it ate and defecated. Expect to pay around $100 to $500, depending on the species and age of the snake.</p><p>It's up to you to decide whether you want an adult snake or a hatchling. If you have limited experience with snakes, you might want to choose a hatchling. You can pretty much guarantee it's been captive-bred, and you'll be able to start handling it from a young age.</p><p>A healthy snake's ribs shouldn't be visible, and it shouldn't have any noticeable kinks in its body when it stretches to its full length. Plus, you should check its skin for mites and ticks before agreeing to take it home.</p>",1091

It has a brown to yellow shell and very thick, yellowish-brown skin, along with pointed scalesor spurson its legs. Native to arid and semiarid regions of Africa, these tortoises can adapt to various living conditions, which is one reason why they have become popular as a pet.However, they don't make ideal pets for everyone due to their long lifespans and specific care requirements. But if you can keep them happy and healthy, they can make for very fun, curious, and friendly companions.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Sulcata tortoise, African spurred tortoise</p><p>Adult Size:18 to 30 inches long, weighing 80 to 150 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 70 years or more</p><h2>Sulcata Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Sulcata tortoises are quiet like all other tortoises, and they are big and slow. They also tend to be curious creatures, sometimes to their detriment. They can easily get stuck in spaces that are too small for them, as well as flip themselves over and be unable to right themselves. As pets, these tortoises are generally pleasant and docile. They're rarely aggressive or territorial. But they still should not be handled regularly, especially when they're younger and more fragile. Excessive handling can cause stress and lead to health issues or even premature death.</p><h2>Housing the Sulcata Tortoise </h2><p>Access to a spacious outdoor enclosure is ideal for these large tortoises. They need a sturdy fence around 2 feet tall. And because they burrow quite well, the fence should be extended underground at least a foot in an outdoor enclosure. Shelter in the form of a doghouse or small shed is a good idea to provide protection from the elements, and a muddy wallow may be included for your tortoise to soak and defecate in.</p><p>Housing adult sulcata tortoises indoors can be impractical due to their size, but you will have to provide them with a warm space if you live in a colder climate. An outdoor heated shed or greenhouse where they can live when it is cool outside can be a suitable option. If you do choose to bring an adult sulcata indoors, you likely will need to dedicate a room to it.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Sulcata tortoisesneed hot temperatures to stay healthy and active. They can handle outdoor temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, as long as they have access to a shady spot where they can go if they need to cool off. If the nighttime temperature drops below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, they'll need some supplemental heat.</p><p>Maintain daytime temperatures in a room, greenhouse, or shed where your tortoise resides at around 80 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit with a basking lamp at around 95 degrees Fahrenheit. At night, temperatures between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit are typically fine. Don't let the enclosure get too cold, or your tortoise might stop eating and be more susceptible to illness.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Tortoises housed in an outdoor enclosure don't need any special light beyond the sun. But when they're housed indoors, a UVA/UVB light is necessary for your sulcata tortoise because it won't be getting regular, unfiltered sunlight. The light will help your tortoise grow strong bones, avoid disease,and stay healthy. Be sure to place the light close enough to your tortoise for it to receive the benefits, following the product instructions.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Sulcata tortoises prefer a humidity level of around 40 to 55 percent. Humidity that's too high can lead to fungal infections and other issues. If you need to raise the humidity, lightly mist the tortoise's enclosure once or twice a day.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Sulcata tortoises are herbivorous, grazing tortoises that need a high-fiber, low-protein diet. This can be provided by feeding a variety of grasses and hays (comprising at least 75 percent of their diet), along with some edible weeds and flowers, such as dandelions, clover, endive, and cactus pads. Small amounts of other leafy green vegetables are also fine. Avoid foods high in oxalates, such as spinach, mustard and beet greens, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower.</p><p>Your tortoise will nibble on the grasses and weeds in its environment throughout the day, and you should offer a salad of other leafy greens and vegetables every one to two days. Check with your veterinarian to make sure you're offering the proper variety and quantity, as this largely depends on age, size, and health of your tortoise.</p><p>Many owners supplement the veggies with a calcium powder once or twice a week (or as directed). Do not feed fruits, animal protein, or pelleted tortoise foods from the pet store unless directed by your veterinarian. Tortoises get most of their hydration from their food, but you also should include a shallow water dish in their enclosure that you refresh daily.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Like many reptiles, sulcata tortoises are prone to respiratory infections, especially if they're kept in environments that are too humid.And like other tortoises and turtles, shell rot is a common problem. This is usually caused by a fungal infection that leads to a flaky, dry shell.</p><p>Metabolic bone disease is another serious ailment among tortoises and other reptiles. When the animal's phosphorous-to-calcium ratio is out of balance, it can lead to softening and weakening of its bones. This disease can cause deformities and eventually death if not treated properly</p><p>All of these conditions are treatable by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles if caught early enough. Don't try to treat your tortoise with home remedies unless recommended by your vet.</p><h2>Choosing Your Sulcata Tortoise </h2><p>Getting a sulcata tortoise from a reputable breeder who can tell you about its health history is crucial. This is an animal you'll ostensibly have for a very long time, so you'll want to start off on a healthy foot.Breeders are fairly easy to find across in the United States, thanks to the animal's popularity. Expect to pay between $50 and $200 on average for a young sulcata tortoise.</p><p>Look for a tortoise with clear eyes and a smooth shell. And if possible, ask to see it eat. A healthy sulcata tortoise is a voracious eater; if it's not taking food, this could be a sign of illness. Most importantly, be sure you're up to the task of adopting such a large animal that could theoretically outlive you. Many sulcata tortoises are unfortunately rehomed, so you'll need to have a plan in place for someone to care for your tortoise if you're not able to any longer.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Sulcata Tortoise </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your new pet.</p><p>Quickly! Sulcata tortoises grow to be six to 10 inches long by the time they are 2 years old. They are the fastest-growing species of tortoise and eventually reach an adult weight of 79 to 110 pounds.</p><p>Lots of veggies, at least 20 percent of a sulcata's diet should be various fruits and veggies. After that, the rest of their diet should be grass or hay.</p><p>Despite many old wives tales stating you can count rings on the bottom of the tortoise's shell, there really is no way to tell the age of the tortoise unless you have proof of its existence: For example, if you get it from a breeder and it's however many months old, you can keep track from there.</p>",1243
36,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cherry-head-red-footed-tortoises-4057737,Reptiles & Amphibians > Tortoises,<h1>Cherry Head Red-Footed Tortoise: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Cherry Head Red-Footed Tortoise: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Cherry head red-footed tortoises are considered a smaller variant of the red-footed tortoise, and they're closely related to the yellow-footed tortoise. Because they're technically the same type of tortoise as the red-footed tortoise, cherry heads have the same Latin name () and almost identical care requirements. Some people believe cherry heads were intentionally bred to be small versions of red-footed tortoises, but they're actually found naturally in the wild and are native to Brazil.They live along rivers and near the edge of forests. As their name suggests, they feature bright patches of either red or orange on their legs and head, and their shell color varies from a light to dark brownish color.</p><p>They're fairly easy to care for as pets, though they are a long-term commitment. Expect to spend several hours per week on their feeding routine, as well as keeping their environment clean. They're not animals you'll be able to excessively handle, as this can cause undue stress. But they can learn to be calm around people.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Cherry head red-footed tortoise</p><p>Adult Size: Less than 12 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 50 years in captivity</p><h2>Cherry Head Red-Footed Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These tortoises are fairly hardy, somewhat shy, and intelligent. Most quickly learn their feeding routine, as well as where everything is in their enclosure. Plus, they are known for their strong senses. They have a good sense of smell, and they typically can feel the slightest touch. Thus, it's important to handle your tortoise carefully and gently. Overhandling can easily stress a tortoise and result in illness or even death. But with consistent, calm handling, these tortoises generally become comfortable around people.</p><p>They also can be kept in groups of other tortoises because they're not highly territorial. But watch out for males competing over a female tortoise, as they can become aggressive and injure each other. They're typically active during the day but might rest for a while after a large meal. Plus, they generally don't hibernate but might slow down during the colder months. Still, expect to maintain their care routine throughout the entire year, including regularly cleaning the enclosure, monitoring the heat and humidity, and providing a balanced diet.</p><h2>Housing the Cherry Head Red-Footed Tortoise </h2><p>Outside housing is preferable for these tortoises if you live in the right climate. Outdoors, they need a sturdy, escape-proof enclosure with walls at least 16 inches tall and a few inches below the ground to prevent a tortoise from digging under them. Don't use see-through fencing because tortoises can be more enticed to escape if they can see something outside of their enclosure. Moreover, many people add netting or wire to the top of the enclosure to protect the tortoise from predators.</p><p>Include a muddy wallow within the enclosure, as well as a pan of clean water for wading.Ideally, the enclosure will have an area with densely planted vegetation, which will help your tortoise cool off when necessary. You also can include a doghouse-type shelter to protect your tortoise from the elements.</p><p>If you choose tohouse your tortoise indoors, you'll need an enclosure that's at least 3 feet by 5 feet. Many people choose to use large plastic storage containers, especially for young tortoises.A store-bought or homemade tortoise table is also an option.A pan of water should be provided at all times for soaking and drinking. And a hide box should be placed at the cool end of the enclosure for a sheltered retreat for your tortoise.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>When housed outdoors, these tortoises can safely live in daytime temperatures that reach 100 degrees Fahrenheit, as long as they have a shady spot and access to water. They can tolerate some cold, too. But if the nighttime temperature drops below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, provide them with a heated shelter that ideally maintains temperatures in the 70s. For an indoor enclosure, room temperatures between around 68 degrees Fahrenheit to 80 degrees Fahrenheit are typically fine. Use a heat lamp on one side of the enclosure to create a basking spot at 95 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>For indoor enclosures, use aUVB light overhead for roughly 12 to 14 hours per day to mimic a natural day-night cycle. This lighting will help your tortoise properly absorb the calcium in its diet, staving off disease. Outdoors, tortoises acquire the UV lighting they need from the natural sunlight.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>This species is native to tropical areas and prefers a humid climate. Maintain a humidity level of around 70% to 80%. The water pan in the enclosure will help to add humidity, and you can lightly mist the enclosure to increase the humidity if necessary. Regularly measure the enclosure humidity with a hygrometer.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Various materials, or substrates, can be used to line the bottom of an indoor enclosure, including peat moss, coconut coir, and paper. The substrate helps to mimic the look and feel of the tortoise's natural habitat. Many people prefer cypress bark because it helps to retain humidity. In an outdoor enclosure, the natural soil is generally fine, as long as it's not treated with any lawn chemicals or fertilizers.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Cherry head red-footed tortoises are omnivores and eat a wider range of foods than many other species of tortoises do. Feed your tortoise a variety of fresh, dark, leafy greens, such as dandelion greens, endive, mustard greens, and escarole. Plus, offer other vegetables and fruits, including carrots and clover hay. Do not feed a lot of animal protein. One small serving of moistened, low-fat cat food or lean meat every other week is enough. In addition, a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement should be given a few times a week.</p><p>Many owners feed their tortoises every day or two, but that largely depends on the animal's age and size, as well as the variety of food offered at each meal. Consult your veterinarian for the proper quantity and spacing of feedings for your particular animal.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>One health issue occurring in these tortoises is shell rot, an infectious disease caused by bacteria or fungus and presenting as flaky patches on the animal's shell. It's a fairly common but problematic health condition that can lead to more serious infections, and it usually requires antibiotics.</p><p>Some tortoises also might develop vitamin A deficiency, which can cause swollen eyes and other infections. Furthermore, unsanitary living conditions often lead to ear infections. Both of these ailments should clear up with antibiotic treatment from a veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing Your Cherry Head Red-Footed Tortoise </h2><p>Red-footed tortoises are popular pets and therefore have become vulnerable to extinction in the wild due to people catching and selling them. You should never purchase a wild-caught tortoise; instead, seek out a reputable breeder or rescue organization. Expect to pay around $200 to $500 for hatchlings and young tortoises. Be sure to ask about the tortoise's health history. And select a tortoise that is alert with bright eyes. Lethargy or any discharge around the eyes, nose, or mouth could be a sign of disease, such as a respiratory infection.</p>",1190
37,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hermanns-tortoise-1237262,Reptiles & Amphibians > Tortoises,<h1>Hermann's Tortoise: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Hermann's Tortoise: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Hermann's tortoisealong with the spur-thighed tortoise and the marginated tortoiseis a Mediterranean tortoise that hails from the rocky hillsides and oak and beech forests of Mediterranean Europe. This attractive tortoise, with a yellow and brown carapace, thick scales, and strong legs, is highly coveted for its mild temperament and its sheer beauty. Care for this tortoise is relatively easy if you live in a suitable climate with plenty of outdoor space. Otherwise, indoor care is complicated.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Hermann's tortoise</p><p>Adult Size:6 to 8 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Average, up to 75 years, although some may live longer</p><h2>Hermann's Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The passive and gentle Hermann's tortoise rarely bites. Typically, it will only bite other tortoises, pets, or humans to defend itself. It does not like to be handled, preferring to stay safely grounded.</p><p>This active creature likes to run, dig, forage, and sunbathe. It is not much of a climber. Tortoises frequently interact and can engage in combat, especially during the mating season in spring and fall. During courtship, male tortoises will chase and ram the females, sometimes causing harm. Only bring males and females together if you intend to mate them; otherwise, house them separately.</p><h2>Housing the Hermann's Tortoise </h2><p>Adult Hermann's tortoises do not fare well indoors, so keep this in mind before bringing one home. Since outdoor housing is strongly recommended, your outdoor climate should closely resemble the Mediterranean region's (Italy, Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania) climate.</p><p>A tortoise habitat should consist of a shallow pan of water (preferably sunk into the ground) for drinking and cooling off, rocks, small trees and bushes, and a shelter to protect it from extreme weather and predators. The pen should also be escape-proof with fencing or sides dug a couple of feet underground since these active tortoises tend to burrow.</p><p>If you ultimately decide to house your tortoise indoors or move it inside during colder weather months, a relatively large enclosure is necessary (2-feet by 4-feet at minimum).</p><p>To keep the enclosure clean, scoop up visible pet wastes when you notice them. Change the water pan daily. You will need to change the substrate at least every one to two months.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>If housed outside, daytime temperatures should average around 80 F to 86 F (27 C to 30 C) and shouldn't fall below 65 F to 70 F (18 C to 21 C) at night. Mimic these temperatures in an indoor enclosure. Lighting will be your primary source of heating for indoor enclosures. Whether inside or outside, it is also necessary to have a cool, shaded area for your tortoise to escape the heat. Make sure the water pan that you provide is deep enough for your pet to immerse its whole body in case it wants to cool off.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>If outdoors, the sun will provide adequate lighting. If indoors, provide a basking light or heat lamp that mimics the sun, complete with a basking spot (a set of low, flat rocks work well) with an ambient temperature of about 95 F (35 C).</p><p>Tortoises require UVB light to synthesize vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 helps the tortoise absorb calcium, which is crucial for bone structure and growth. All indoor enclosures should include a10 percent fluorescent UVB tubelight with areflectorto spread the UVB rays downward to the tortoise.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Humidity is not a significant concern for tortoises. As long as the humidity is at least 25% or higher (most indoor and outdoor environments are), then ambient moisture is adequate for your tortoise.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most pet owners use a substrate or bedding to line the bottom of the cage. In the case of tortoises, they need it for digging. For indoor enclosures, a mix of soil, sand, and composted cypress bark should make up the substrate in your pet's enclosure. The compost mixture should be about two inches deep so that your tortoise can burrow to cool itself off or get activity and exercise.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>A tortoise's diet should replicate wild foraging. Choose a variety of leafy greens and grasses to feed your pet. Supplement greens with smaller quantities of broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, and carrots, apples, apricots, grapes, melons, peaches, and strawberries. Feed it once daily at the same time every day from several food trays spread throughout the enclosure. Give them as much food as they will eat within 15 to 30 minutes, or you can estimate the pile of food to offer should be about the size of the animal's shell.</p><p>An indoor tortoise requires nutrient boosters to make up for its lack of direct sunlight. Give your pet a high-quality tortoise food that includes calcium and vitamin D3 supplements. Wild tortoises also eat insects, slugs, and carrion, but if you feed these critters, offer them in moderation. Tortoises are primarily vegetarian; never feed them a dog or cat food.</p><p>Change and clean its water pan daily and replenish it with filtered water.</p><h2>Hibernation </h2><p>If the enclosure or outdoor temperature drops below 50 F, your pet tortoise may decide to hibernate. Some species hibernate in the wild for up to five months, usually between October and April. For indoor tortoises, however, it is hard to maintain the environmental conditions conducive to a safe hibernation. Therefore, it's best to maintain a consistent enclosure temperature, keeping your tortoise active all year long.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>During the mating season, male turtles get aggressive with other males and females. Monitor and inspect tortoises daily for wounds and isolate any injured animals. Open wounds will require cleaning and antibacterial treatment to prevent infection. If you can't do this, seek medical attention from an exotics veterinarian.</p><h2>ChoosingYour Hermann's Tortoise </h2><p>It is best to buy your tortoise directly from a breeder. Buying from a reputable breeder ensures your pet did not come from a source that's depleting wild populations, plus breeders also offer superior care. Exotics vets and other reptile owners may recommend reputable breeders, or you can find them at reptile expos and shows. You can expect to pay $150 to $500 for a Hermann's tortoise. The price goes up for older tortoises, factoring in the cost to raise them to adulthood and that they are thriving.</p><p>Do not buy a Hermann's tortoise from a pet shop or dealer as there is a larger chance that the tortoises might have come from a non-reputable source. Usually, the housing environment and care are subpar, which potentially increases your risk of acquiring a sick pet.</p><p>Signs of a healthy tortoise include a smooth shell with no odd bumps or malformations. Its eyes, nose, and mouth should be clear with no discharge..</p>",1118
38,https://www.thesprucepets.com/greek-tortoises-and-spur-thighed-tortoises-1239534,Reptiles & Amphibians > Tortoises,<h1>Greek Tortoise: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Greek Tortoise: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Native to Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Southwest Asia, Greek tortoises are commonly kept as pets, and their affable personalities make them enjoyable companions. Greek tortoises sport a shell that's tan to yellow with dark brown to black. They're generally easygoing pets, as long as owners meet their specific care needs. However, because these pet tortoises have a lifespan in captivity often of 50 years or longer, prospective owners should think long and hard about whether they want to commit to caring for an animal that could easily outlive them.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Greek tortoise, spur-thighed tortoise</p><p>Adult Size:Up to 10 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 50 years or more</p><h2>Greek Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Like many pet reptiles, Greek tortoises prefer not to be handled by humans. Handling is very stressful for tortoises, and it can have a negative impact on their health. Some tortoises might even bite if picked up. When you do have to handle your tortoise, such as moving it out of its enclosure for cleaning, do so slowly and gently.</p><p>For the most part, Greek tortoises are amiable and mellow creatures if their needs are met and their aversion to handling is respected. Once they get to know their owners, many become quite social. They'll often walk right up to people, especially if they see someone with food.</p><h2>Housing the Greek Tortoise </h2><p>Greek tortoises stay fairly small but still need ample space to exercise. Many tortoise owners prefer using large plastic storage tubs or building wooden enclosures instead of using fish tanks for housing. Tortoises don't need the height tanks offer, only the floor space. An enclosure that's at least 3 feet by 6 feet with walls around 18 inches tall is adequate, though bigger is always better. Make sure you remove uneaten food and other visible waste from the enclosure daily, and scrub all surfaces of the enclosure with a reptile-safe cleaner weekly.</p><p>If the temperature is 75 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, allow your tortoise some outdoor time. However, it is crucial you never leave your tortoise alone when it is outside. Tortoises can run away faster than one might think, and they're very good at hiding. Plus, predators such as raccoons and hawks can scoop them up.</p><p>It's ideal to build a tortoise-safe outdoor pen that has a secure screened top. Also, bury the pen walls around 6 inches deep to prevent your tortoise from digging under them and escaping. Make sure the pen has sunny and shady sections. And never put your tortoise outside in a glass tank, as the glass and sunlight can create oven-like conditions.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Greek tortoises prefer an environment that's between 75 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. One section of your tortoise's enclosure should be for basking with a heat lamp that maintains a temperature between 95 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the daytime. At night, the enclosure temperature can be between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If kept outside, these tortoises can handle night temperatures that drop to around 65 degrees Fahrenheit. In the wild, they usually hibernate through cooler winter temperatures.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>In addition to a heat lamp for the basking area, the tortoise also needs UVB-emitting lighting for around 12 hours per day. This light promotes vitamin D production in the tortoise, which helps to metabolize calcium and strengthen bones. Without a UVB lamp or sufficient natural sunlight, your tortoise might develop bone abnormalities.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Greek tortoises need a humidity level between 40% and 60%. Use a hygrometer (humidity gauge) to monitor the enclosure's moisture level. Maintain humidity by misting the tortoise every other day or as often as needed. Plus, keeping your tortoise's water dish filled at all times will add humidity.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Reptile-safe mulch, aspen wood shavings, and dirt mixtures are good substrate (or bedding) options for Greek tortoises. Just make sure the food they eat is offered on a plate or other surface, so they don't accidentally ingest their bedding.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Greek tortoises are herbivores and do best with a diet that's high in fiber and low in protein. A variety of dark, leafy greens and other vegetables should be the majority of your tortoise's diet: collard greens, endive, fresh parsley, dandelion greens, zucchini, broccoli, and shredded carrots. Feed your tortoise a few different choices of veggies each day. Timothy hay that is chopped up should be added to keep your tortoise's beak trimmed and for the additional fiber.</p><p>They can eat small amounts of fruits, such as chopped raspberries, strawberries, or apples. But this should not make up more than 10 percent of the diet.</p><p>You can supplement your tortoise's diet with a quality commercial pellet fed daily. Also, regular dusting of the produce with a calcium powder is often recommended to make sure your tortoise is getting enough calcium. Follow your veterinarian's advice on supplementation and feeding to maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>A water dish should be large enough and accessible for your tortoise to walk into and drink or defecate when needed. Change the water daily or as needed to maintain cleanliness.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Like many other tortoises and turtles, shell rot is commonly found in Greek tortoises. Usually due to a fungal infection, shell rot can cause painful shell deformities that are life-threatening to the animal if left untreated.</p><p>Also, like other reptiles, Greek tortoises are susceptible to metabolic bone disease. This ailment results from an imbalance in a tortoise's calcium-to-phosphorous ratio and leads to overall weakening of its bones. It's another painful condition that can be fatal if not properly treated.</p><p>Moreover, respiratory infections affect Greek tortoises like they do many other reptiles. Symptoms include wheezing and lethargy. Incorrect habitat humidity is often the culprit of these infections.</p><p>In terms of their behavior, as long as you respect your tortoise's desire not to be handled, you should coexist peacefully. But be warned a tortoise might bite or scratch if it feels threatened.</p><h2>Choosing Your Greek Tortoise </h2><p>Your best bet for getting a Greek tortoise is from a reputable breeder who knows its medical history. You're potentially committing to this pet for a very long time, so it's ideal to start with a healthy animal. The average cost for a Greek tortoise is around $200.</p><p>A healthy tortoise generally should have clear eyes, no signs of excess mucus, and a smooth shell without any deformity or decay. If possible, ask the tortoise's breeder or rescue group if you can watch it eat. The only tortoise that refuses food is one that is ill.</p>",1092

Unlike most salamanders, they do not undergo metamorphosis from larval to adult form where breathing changes from gills to lungs. Instead, they remain aquatic their entire life. Thus, they are not pets you handle, but they can be quite entertaining to watch.They are relatively easy to care for and hardy, which makes them suitable for beginner pet owners. Plus, their dietary needs are fairly straightforward.</p><h3>What Is an Axolotl?</h3><p>An axolotl isa type of salamander that can be found in a variety of colors, including black, gray, gold, and white.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Axolotl, Mexican walking fish</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size: Between 6 and 18 inches long, though over 12 inches is rare</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years on average</p><h2>Axolotl Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>While axolotls are relatively hardy to slight fluctuations in their environment, they also have delicate, soft bodies with permeable skin. In fact, most of their body is made of cartilage rather than bone. That means they should not be handled unless absolutely necessary. And if you do have to move them out of their tank, do so with a fine mesh net that won't entangle any of their body parts.</p><p>Once you have their housing setup correct, you generally only have to spend a few hours per week on feeding and cleaning. The rest is simply enjoying them as a quiet, aquatic companion. Axolotls tend to be fairly bold and are perfectly content to move about their tank as they're being watched by their humans. Some will come up to the side of their tank when a person is there observing them.</p><p>However, they aren't particularly social animals and don't require any tank companions. They should not be kept with other species as axolotls might try to eat pet fish, and the fish sometimes nip at them, as well. You even should be cautious about housing them with other axolotls. Juvenile axolotls can be cannibalistic toward one another, so they are best raised in separate enclosures. Adults can potentially be housed together, but still, watch out for cannibalistic tendencies. If a body part gets bitten off by a tank mate, an axolotl actually can regenerate it over time. However, it's still best to avoid this situation altogether.</p><h3>Watch Now: Axolotls are Cute, But Do They Make Good Pets?</h3><h2>Housing the Axolotl </h2><p>At least a 15- to 20-gallon fish tank is recommended for axolotls. Make sure the tank has a secure lid, as it's not uncommon for these animals to try to jump out of their enclosure. A land area is unnecessary in the tank for these fully aquatic animals. At a minimum, the water depth should be slightly more than the length of your axolotl. But adding extra depth will help with water quality and give your animal more room to move.</p><p>Keep the tank in a cool room away from bright sunlight with the water temperature between 57 and 68 degrees Fahrenheit (14 and 20 degrees Celsius); don't allow it to get above 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius). No special lighting is required for axolotls (unlike many reptiles). In fact, a dark hiding spot, such as a flower pot laid on its side or an aquarium castle, is often appreciated.</p><p>Some owners opt to leave the bottom of the tank bare, though others believe this might stress the axolotl if it can't get a foothold on the smooth bottom. If gravel is used on the bottom, it must be coarse gravel that's bigger than the axolotl's head. Fine gravel might be ingested and cause an obstruction.</p><p>Tap water treated with an aquarium water conditioner that removes chlorine and chloramines is fine for axolotls. Never use distilled water, and make sure the pH of the water remains between 6.5 and 7.5. (You can find a water test kit to check at most pet stores.) Most owners find a filtered aquarium is easier to maintain because unfiltered water needs frequent changing to remove waste. However, if you choose to have a filter on the tank, the filtration rate should be slow. Powerful filters that create strong currents can stress an axolotl.</p><p>For a filtered tank, cleaning typically consists of a 20% water change each week, as well as siphoning waste from the bottom of the tank. If you're not using a filter, you likely will have to do a 20% water change daily or every other day. Never do a full water change, as this can alter the water chemistry too drastically and stress your animal.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>In the wild, axolotls feed on snails, worms, crustaceans, small fish, and small amphibians. In captivity, they can be fed a variety of brine shrimp, small strips of beef or liver, earthworms, bloodworms, tubifex worms, otherfrozen fish foods, and commercial fish pellets. Do not feed any worms or fish you caught yourself, as they can carry parasites. In general, no vitamin or mineral supplements are necessary.</p><p>Consult your veterinarian regarding the amount of food to offer, as well as how often to feed your axolotl, as this varies depending on age and size. In general, many adults take two to three feedings per week. One of the best methods to feed is by holding the food in round-nosed forceps in the tank near the animal. You also can simply drop the food in the water as close to the axolotl as possible. If your axolotl isn't interested in eating much during the day, try feeding it in the evening when it's typically more active. Remove any uneaten food from the tank every day to keep the water clean.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>A notable characteristic of axolotls is their regenerative powers. In the case of injuries that aren't life-threatening, they're able to regrow their limbs, tail, and even other body parts, such as heart and eye tissue.</p><p>But this remarkable ability doesn't protect them from all health issues. Unsanitary tank conditions can lead to viral or bacterial infections, the signs of which include lethargy and a lack of appetite. Plus, ammonia buildup from waste in the tank can be toxic. If this occurs, it can interfere with the respiratory process causing damage to the gills as well as result in neurological damage.</p><p>Moreover, axolotls with gravel in their tank that's small enough to eat are prone to gastrointestinal obstructions. If your axolotl experiences an obstruction, it will likely be sluggish and not want to eat. And if it's not promptly treated, death can occur quickly.</p><p>Furthermore, axolotls rarely do undergo metamorphosis into a terrestrial form. The reasons for this are poorly understood, though it might have to do with hormones or water characteristics. The metamorphosis can be extremely stressful for an axolotl, and it can significantly shorten its lifespan. If you notice abnormal changes to your animal's body, such as it starting to grow larger, have a veterinarian who specializes in exotic pets examine it as soon as possible.</p><h2>Is It Legal to Own a Pet Axolotl? </h2><p>Axolotls are illegal to own in some states, including California, Maine, New Jersey, and Virginia.In New Mexico, they are legal to own but illegal to import from other states. Check your local exotic pet laws to verify that you may keep one.</p><p>Axolotls are native to Mexico and are considered a critically endangered species due to loss of habitat, declining water quality and urbanization. Thus, they should never be taken from the wild for the pet trade. The vast majority of pet axolotls descend from captive-bred animals that were used for scientific research.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Axolotl </h2><p>Always acquire an animal from a reputable breeder or rescue group. It's best not to buy an axolotl through the internet or a classified ad unless you've spoken directly with the seller, and they're able to provide you with adequate information on the animal. If they can't give you thorough documentation on its origin and health history, that's a red flag. It's also ideal to speak with people who have acquired animals from that seller to uncover any concerns. Plus, a local exotic veterinarian often can direct you to a good breeder or rescue.</p><p>Expect to pay between $20 and $70 on average. Animals with more rare coloring, such as copper, tend to cost more. A healthy axolotl will be active, and it might accept food if you offer it. Its skin shouldn't be flaky, and its body should be somewhat plump (as opposed to underweight), though it shouldn't have any abnormal swelling.</p>",1494
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/green-iguanas-1239136,Reptiles & Amphibians,<h1>Green Iguana Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Green Iguana Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Possibly due to their starring roles in the 1960s Godzilla movies, the green iguanas (American iguana) that are found from southern Brazil all the way north to Mexico have become the most popular of all reptile pets. However, not only are these huge lizards poor pets, but the vast majority of owners who acquire them are not capable of providing the very specialized care they require. It is, unfortunately, all too common for pet stores to irresponsibly sell green iguanas to unsuspecting admirers who are inexperienced and ill-equipped.</p><p>Regardless of what some websites say, green iguanas are not for beginners. Many owners have been permanently injured by these reptiles, and an even larger number of iguanas have been inadvertently killed by poor care-taking. Besides having complex environmental and dietary requirements, it takes time to bathe them, give them exercise, and prepare their meals. Green iguanas are a long-term commitment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Green iguana, American iguana</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 20 pounds; up to 6 feet in length, the tail accounts for the majority of overall length</p><p>Life Expectancy: In the wild, green iguanas live about 20 years. Captive care can be challenging and many iguanas die within the first few years of life due to severe malnourishment and improper husbandry.</p><h2>Green Iguana Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Green iguanas are diurnal (active during the day), arboreal (living in trees) large lizards that choose to inhabit trees near to and overhanging waterways. Iguanas are extremely good swimmers and will often choose to jump from a branch many stories high into a river splash-down to make a quick getaway.</p><p>These lizards grow to be very large extremely quickly, they do not like to be handled, and they have very dangerous claws and tails that are made for creating lashing injuries. They are not at all afraid to use their claws in the blink of an eye. When confronted, they are formidable fighters even as juveniles. They can inflict serious bites.</p><p>It takes them three to four years to reach adulthood. Juveniles stay in familial groups for the first year of their lives. Male green iguanas in these groups often use their own bodies to shield and protect females from predators (like hawks, owls, snakes, and humans), and they appear to be the only species of reptile to do this.</p><h2>Housing the Green Iguana </h2><p>A full-grown green iguana at six feet long needs more room than it does when it is young and only one foot long, but they do grow quickly. Most adult iguanas require half a small bedroom or a very large enclosure. Plan to construct an enclosure that is 8 feet long, 8 feet tall, and 4 feet wide, at a minimum.</p><p>If you can't let your iguana have its own bedroom in the house, you can build your own custom iguana cage or purchase an expensive custom-built enclosure. You must provide many hefty branches and perches to safely climb on, along with regular bathing opportunities and environmental elements. Green iguanas also require specific heating and lighting elements.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Not commonly recognized, the green iguanas are native to the extreme, tropical environments; they require temperatures of 80 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be healthy.Supplemental heat should be offered by using heat lights and lamps but not heat rocks, as they can cause burns. Basking temperatures should be about 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and the enclosure should never be allowed to drop below 78 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>These lizards must have appropriate sources ofUVBandUVAlighting. Otherwise, their bodies cannot produce vitamin Dthat promotes calcium absorption, which can result in metabolic bone disease (MBD), a fatal condition.<sup></sup>UVB lighting should be on for 10 to 12 hours per day, and the bulbs should be changed every six months, regardless of whether or not the light burns out.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>These tropical lizards require high humidity. Add foggers or misters to separate locations in the enclosure to bring the average humidity up to 80 percent (a 70 to 90 percent range). Test the enclosure with a hygrometer in multiple locations, and bring all parts of the enclosure up to this range.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Many iguana owners are well-meaning but entirely misinformed about what iguanas need to be eating. Although green iguanas in captivity (especially the nutritionally deprived pets) will consume meat, excessive consumption of animal protein will result in severe kidney problems and premature death. Do not feed any meat to your iguana.</p><p>Being herbivores, wild green iguanas feed primarily on vegetables and fruits. Dark leafy greens should make up the majority of the daily diet, including dandelion greens, endive, kale, fresh parsley, mustard greens, arugula, and other calcium-rich leafy vegetables. Iguanas swallow their food whole without chewing, so chop all food items into small pieces. Feed this variety once per day; your iguana will not overeat. Remove and discard any food that hasn't been eaten within 24 hours, as all foods must be fresh to be accepted.</p><p>Misinformed iguana owners also tend to feed themiceberg lettuce, which provides water, but has little nutritional value compared to other vegetables.Vegetables high in oxalates, such as calcium-binding spinach, should be avoided. Small amounts of fruits such as berries can be offered on occasion or to entice your green iguana to eat.</p><p>Provide a tip-proof water basin that is deep enough for your lizard to soak in but not large enough for swimming; change and clean the bowl daily. Iguana will sometimes learn to drink from a separate, clean and non-chlorinated water dish, however, they usually prefer to lap the droplets of water condensate from leaves or cage furnishings. Most of the iguana's hydration will come directly from the vegetarian diet.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Being prone to several disease problems, iguanas in the captive environment are typically not healthy and robust pets. Watch your lizard closely for any signs of irregular or abnormal occurrences related to health.</p><p>If you see blood in your iguana's droppings, it may be from a bladder stone. An examination and radiographs (X-rays) will allow your veterinarian to diagnose this problem. Surgical removal of the stones is usually needed, as is fluid therapy to prevent kidney damage. Your veterinarian will discuss the necessary dietary corrections to prevent future stones from forming.</p><p>Swellings on the body are called abscesses. They are treated by surgical removal or lancing and flushing of the abscess. The material within the abscess can be cultured to identify the infective organism and to determine the treatment path.</p><p>Egg binding (dystocia) happens when a female is unable to pass her eggs. It is a common problem in captive reptiles but it can be life-threatening. Poor husbandry including improper lighting and temperature, wrong diet, and dehydration are common causes. An iguana with dystocia will be uninterested in food and become rapidly sick, lethargic, or unresponsive. Medical and surgical procedures are usually required to help these animals in order to prevent losing them.</p><p>Calcium is needed to help green iguanas grow, have strong bones, and avoid metabolic bone disease; vitamin D3 is needed to metabolize that calcium. Supplemental powders are available that can be dusted on the food at every other feeding. As your iguana grows, monitor the calcium and other chemistry values by having your exotics vet run some basic blood tests. These baseline values will let you know if you are providing enough, or too much calcium, protein, and other nutritional elements.</p><h2>Choosing Your Green Iguana </h2><p>Several dated online articles and books have incorrect information regarding their care, diet, and environmental requirements. Rely mainly on the expertise of scientific websites and the many iguana rescue organizations to learn about how to adopt an animal that is already in need of a home.</p><p>In some sensitive ecosystems, such as the state of Hawaii, iguana ownership is prohibited. They are exotic pets that have no natural predators on the island, so they are potentially hazardous to plant populations and to the insect and bird life the plants support. Due to the possible future impact from iguanas that have been set free by the owner after having grown too big for their owners to handle, the state of Hawaii strictly prohibits the import and possession of these tree-dwelling giants. Violators will spend three years in jail and be fined up to $200,000.</p><p>In New York City, ownership of these exotic lizards has been banned since 1999 out of a concern for public safety. They have been classified as animals that are wild, ferocious, fierce, dangerous, and naturally inclined to do harm to humans. The city's dense human population would all but assure unanticipated and unwanted human encounters associated with inadvertent enclosure escapes.</p>",1452

They are an aquatic turtle that comes from eastern North America.</p><p>If they feel threatened, they can release a foul, musky odor, which is how they got their alternative name of stinkpot. They may be small, but these turtles can reach ripe old ages of 30 to 50 years old, and they can be feisty, too. They are not a commitment that should be taken on lightly.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Common Musk Turtle, Eastern Musk Turtle, Stinkpot</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to and even over 50 years</p><h2>Common Musk Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The common musk turtle, due to their small size, is one of the most popular of all the aquatic turtle species. You should not, however, underestimate the amount of care that they require. Male stinkpots have longer tails that have visible spikes making it easy to sex this species. They rarely grow to be more than five and a half inches.</p><p>They come with a brown, grey or black carapace (upper shell), which is highly domed in young turtles, but it flattens out as they grow older. They also have two very distinct yellow stripes that run from the nose to the neck, although, again, these can fade with age.</p><p>While they do spend most of their time in the water, they tend to stick to the shallows as they are not particularly strong swimmers. They are also naturally nocturnal and could be more active through the night.</p><p>They get their name from the fact that, if they feel threatened, they can emit a strong, repellant, foul-smelling odor from their scent glands. They are also known for being rather spunky and can scratch and bite if they feel uncomfortable. They have a long and flexible neck which also makes it easier to grab their target.</p><p>All turtles should be handled with care and respect.To ensure you are not at the end of a nasty nip, you should be especially careful if you have to handle the stinkpot.Picking them up towards the rear of their shell can help.</p><p>There is a risk that aquatic turtles can carry the bacteria. You must wash your hands after handling them. If you have children, you will need to supervise interactions to ensure they are not tempted to put their hands in their mouth before washing.</p><p>The stinkpot is an aquatic turtle that is best observed rather than having lots of physical contact.</p><h2>Housing the Common Musk Turtle </h2><p>The stinkpot will need a suitable tank that will allow them to swim with ease. Unlike some aquatic breeds, they do not need deep water or a substrate (like gravel) on the base of the tank. This also makes the tank easier to clean. If you do want a more attractive looking tank, it will be okay to use a medium sized-gravel. The water depth should be shallow so that the turtle can touch the bottom of the tank and still stretch up to reach the surface without always having to paddle.</p><p>They do not need as big a tank as some of their larger species relatives.Generally, it is still recommended to have a tank designed to hold a minimum of 30 gallons for one turtle as they are an active species. If you plan to house a male and a female together, you will need to watch out for the male becoming too over-eager and harassing the female. If this is happening, you should be prepared to separate them. Two males should not be housed together.</p><p>While the stinkpot spends most of its time in the water, you should still ensure you provide suitable areas to allow them to come out of the water to bask and rest. They dehydrate quickly, so it is not so common for them to spend lengthy periods basking outside of water. Providing structures for basking and plants for support also gives additional enrichment and exploration opportunities.</p><p>A water filter compatible with shallow waters is needed to keep the turtle's habitat clean.Without it, you would have to empty the tank to clean it too regularly. Stinkpots, because of their high-protein diet, can be messier than some other turtle species, so a strong filter system is recommended.</p><p>Alongside an efficient, continually running filtration system, you should still thoroughly clean out the tank at least every few months, and sometimes sooner. You can purchase kits to test the water for cleanliness levels to ensure it does not get unsafe for your turtle to be in.</p><p>Whenever you are putting new water into the tank, you should ensure that this is dechlorinated. The chlorine from tap water can impact on the efficiency of the filter and the health of your turtle.</p><p>If you have dogs or cats, make sure that you have an appropriate cover for the tank to keep your turtle safe.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Although they are not prolific baskers, they should have a warm area to allow them the option, and the temperature in these areas should around 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature should be kept at around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If you are using water heaters to maintain this temperature, be very careful to ensure that the water does not evaporate and expose the heater. This can result in overheating, and it can be dangerous for your turtle.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB-Lighting is recommended to ensure that your turtle is getting enough crucial vitamin D3 to help them metabolize calcium properly. Although this is often added to commercially available pellets, if they do not get enough through their diet, the lighting will ensure that they remain in better health.It is worth noting, however, that the common musk turtle is more capable of synthesizing vitamin D3 than other turtles.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>In the wild, the common musk turtle would eat a wide variety of water fish and insects. They are primarily carnivorous, although they do sometimes eat certain algae. In captivity, providing a varied diet will help to ensure that they remain happy and healthy. Commercial turtle pellets fed alongside high-protein foods such as earthworms, crickets, fish and shrimp are a good choice. Some stinkpots may also enjoy grazing on leafy greens too, but don't be offended if they turn their nose up at them.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The common musk turtle is generally regarded as a healthy little species. As with all aquatic turtles, however, there are certain health conditions they could develop that it is worth being aware of.</p><p>Hypovitaminosis A: This is when your turtle does not receive enough vitamin A in their diet. It can result in swelling in the eyes and respiratory issues that can lead to further complications. This can be treated by providing a vitamin supplement and can be avoided by ensuring that your turtle is fed a balanced diet. If you find a pellet they enjoy, this will help to ensure they get a good balance.</p><p>Infectious Diseases are a relatively common problem in aquatic turtles and these can range in their severity. By ensuring that your turtle is residing in clean water, this can help to minimize the risk of developing a problem.</p><p>Parasites: It is not uncommon for even healthy aquatic turtles to host certain parasites in their system, like nematodes or flagellates. If their numbers become too great, or they pick up parasites like tapeworms from another host, this can impact on their health. You may see things like weight loss, lethargy or diarrhea. By organizing an annual fecal exam through an exotic specialist vet, this can help to ensure things are kept under control.</p><h2>Choosing Your Common Musk Turtle </h2><p>It is very important to make sure that you seek out a reputable breeder or rescue organization when looking to own a stinkpot turtle. Your turtle should be captive-bred to ensure the preservation of the wild populations.</p><p>In the United States, there is a law that prohibits sales of turtles with a carapace under 4 inches. This means you will not find a hatchling stinkpot through most breeders.</p><p>It is usually better to go to a small-scale specialist breeder rather than just a general pet store. Not only will a reputable specialist have more guarantees around how the turtle was sourced and raised, but also they will often provide much better specialist advice.</p>",1426

They are found in multiple regions of the Eastern and Midwestern United States as well as southern regions of Canada.</p><p>They are a popular choice as a pet as they are attractive, not too big, and can live well in or outdoors. The decision to take on a Clemmy, however, should not be taken lightly. They need a lot of care to keep them healthy, and they are likely to outlive you. Some have been recorded as reaching over 50 years of age.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Spotted Turtle, Clemmy, Michigan Spotted Turtle</p><p>Adult Size: 4 to 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can easily live up to 26 years, with some recorded as living over 50 years</p><p></p><h2>Spotted Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The Spotted Turtle, due to their small size, is a popular semi-aquatic turtle species. This does not mean that they are easy to care for, however. As with all aquatic turtles, they have complex housing and dietary needs that need to be considered.</p><p>This species is very distinctive because of the yellow-spotted markings they develop on their carapace (the upper part of their shell). These tend to be small in number in juveniles and grow, sometimes to over 100 spots, on mature adults. The spots are also seen on the face and neck.</p><p>Like the Common Musk Turtle, this is another very small species, and they are usually only between four to six inches in size when fully mature.</p><p>Determining the gender of your is easier as the turtle matures. The female has a reddish chin, whereas the male has a black one. The males tail is longer and thicker too. While they are a semi-aquatic species, they are not known for their swimming skills and stick to the shallows.</p><p>Spotted Turtles are a curious, alert and active species but, as with most aquatic turtles, they can become stressed by over-handling. They are best observed without too much interference.</p><p>If handling is required, this should, ideally, be kept to a minimum, and don't forget always to wash your hands afterwards. There is a small risk that aquaticturtles can carry the salmonella bacteria.</p><h2>Housing the Spotted Turtle </h2><p>This species can be kept out or indoors. Generally, they thrive better when kept in a suitable outdoor enclosure, once they are fully mature.</p><p>They should not be kept in an enclosure with deep waters. Because they are not strong swimmers, this could increase the risk of them drowning or becoming overly tired. Generally, the water levels should be kept where they can rest their feet on the ground but still reach up to the surface. Hatchlings are primarily aquatic, and only leave the water to bask. As they mature, you may notice they don't spend as much time in the water.</p><p>Providing logs and raised areas in their enclosure provides plenty of opportunities for them to rest outside of the water.It also means they are getting additional exercise and enrichment. Using aquatic or plastic plants also offers hiding spots. Make sure that the basking out of water areas are easy to access and dry. Making slanting access points makes it easier for your turtle to get out onto them from the water.</p><p>Because they do spend a lot of time in the water, often even feeding in there, you must ensure the water is kept clean. Dirty tanks and ponds can lead to a variety of health problems for your turtle.</p><p>Using a suitable water filtration system, compatible with shallow water conditions. is often recommended. This means you will have to clean the water manually less often, making things less time consuming for you and less stressful for the turtles. You can also buy kits that allow you to check the cleanliness of the water.This ensures the filter is doing its job effectively and allows you to know when it is time to do a full clean-out.</p><p>Tap water used in the tank or pond should be dechlorinated. The chlorine can impact on the efficiency of the filter and impact the health of your turtle.</p><p>Spotted Turtles can live together, although housing males together is not a good idea as they will usually become aggressive towards one another.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>It is important to keep your Spotted Turtle comfortable and warm. Ideal water temperature will be around 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure that, if you are using water heaters, these are always covered by water. If the water evaporates and they are exposed, it can result in overheating, which can be very dangerous for your turtle.</p><p>You also want to ensure that any basking areas are suitably warm enough, ideally with a temperature of around 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.If the temperature drops too low, this can induce hibernation in your turtle. This can pose a number of risks for your turtle, so, unless you are an expert keeper, it is not generally encouraged.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Turtles need sufficient amounts of Vitamin D3 to help them metabolize calcium properly. Without this, they can suffer from a number of health conditions. Providing UVB lighting above basking spots, particularly in an indoor tank, where your turtle will not be exposed to natural sunlight, is another important consideration.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Spotted Turtles are primarily carnivorous, and providing them with a varied diet will help to maximize their longevity. Once every day or every other day feeding is sufficient, and they often enjoy things like shrimps, worms, crickets, and other insects. They have even been known to enjoy an occasional piece of cooked beef.</p><p>Some enjoy fruits and leafy greens, and others may even like aquatic plants like Duckweed. You can also add in some commercial turtle pellets if these are enjoyed. These pellets often contain Vitamin D3 supplemented calcium which can be beneficial for indoor turtles.</p><p>A calcium supplement without the Vitamin D3 may also be added to the diet of outdoor residents, or you could provide a Cuttlefish bone.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The spotted turtle is generally considered to be a robust little turtle. Like all turtles, it is important to feed them the right diet, provide appropriate lighting and heating, and to keep their water and enclosure clean to keep them in excellent health. Some common aquatic turtle conditions worth being aware of are detailed below.</p><p>Infectious diseasesare a relatively common problem in aquatic turtles, and these can range in their severity. Ensuring your turtle is residing in clean water, and has a warm and clean basking spot to allow their shell to dry out fully, can help to minimize the risk of developing a problem.</p><p>Parasites: It is not uncommon for even healthy aquatic turtles to host certain parasites in their system, like nematodes or flagellates. If their numbers become too great, or they pick up parasites like a tapeworm from another host, this can impact on their health. You may see things like weight loss, lethargy or diarrhea. An annual fecal exam with a specialist exotic vet can help to ensure that potential problems do not go untreated.</p><h2>Choosing Your Spotted Turtle </h2><p>It is so important to do your research when considering providing a home to a Spotted Turtle. You should look for a reputable breeder or rescue organization. Any purchased turtle should be captive-bred to ensure the preservation of wild populations.</p><p>By finding a passionate, knowledgeable and recommended small-scale specialist breeder, you are more likely to get a healthy and ethically sourced turtle.</p><p>In certain areas of the United States, there is a law that prohibits sales of turtles with a carapace under 4 inches.

They range in color but are often a light tan to brown with a long, thick tail and a spiky, beard-like collar around their neck. While they are generally considered good pets, even for beginner reptile owners, they do have fairly complex nutritional and environmental needs. Special equipment and a fair amount of time are needed to care for bearded dragons. However, they are generally social and easy to tame, and they show a range of fascinating behaviors that make them interesting to watch.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Bearded dragon,central bearded dragon, inland bearded dragon</p><p>Adult Size:16 to 24 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy:6 to 10 years</p><h2>Bearded Dragon Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Bearded dragons get their common name from the spines that encircle their necks. These spines usually lie flat. But if a dragon feels threatened, its throat will expand and the spines will stand up. In captivity, however, bearded dragons are generally docile,so owners rarely see their aggressive displays. These animals are active during the day and typically learn to tolerate handling well. Many even enjoy perching on their keepers' shoulders. However, male bearded dragons should be housed separately, as they can be territorial.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Fascinating Bearded Dragon</h3><h2>Housing the Bearded Dragon </h2><p>For a single adult bearded dragon, a 55- to 75-gallon tank, along witha secure screen top, is ideal. Smaller tanks can be used for juveniles, but they will quickly outgrow them.</p><p>Bearded dragons are semi-arboreal (tree-dwelling) and sometimes like to perch off the ground. A selection of sturdy rocks, half logs, and branches can give them something to climb on, especially in the part of the tank used as a basking area. There should also be hiding spots, such as hollow logs, for your bearded dragon to feel comfortable.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Proper temperaturesin the tank are extremely important. As with other reptiles, atemperature gradientshould be provided for your bearded dragon, as well as a basking spot. The gradient should go from 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit on the cool side, up to a basking temperature of around 95 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Nighttime temperatures can fall to approximately 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Heat can be provided via an incandescent light, ceramic heater, or a mercury vapor bulb in a dome reflector hood. You might need to experiment with wattage and distance from the tank to provide appropriate temperatures.</p><p>Use thermometers in the tank to monitor the temperatures at the basking spot, as well as at either end of the thermal gradient. Never rely on estimates. If necessary, an under-tank heater can be used to supplement the heat, especially at night if the room temperature is very low.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Exposure to UV lightingis extremely important for pet bearded dragons. Special fluorescent bulbs can be foundat pet storesthat provide UV light. Your bearded dragon should be able to get within 12 inches of these lights to benefit from the UV emitted, depending on the type of bulb. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Moreover, the lights should be directed through a screen top rather than glass, as glass filters out some UV rays.</p><p>Maintain a consistent day-night cycle by providing roughly 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness each day. Placing the lights on a timer can be helpful.</p><p>Exposure to sunlight can also be beneficial.If time outdoors is provided, shade and shelter must be available, so your bearded dragon can thermoregulate. Neverplace your pet outside in aglasstank, as overheating will quickly occur in the sunlight.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Bearded dragons prefer a humidity level of around 35% to 40%. This mimics their natural arid environment. Usually this level is only difficult to maintain if you live in a high-humidity area. But if you do need to raise the humidity, you can mist your bearded dragon. Monitor the tank humidity using a hydrometer.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material you place on the floor of your bearded dragon's enclosure. It helps to maintain humidity in the environment, and it can give the tank a more natural look and feel.</p><p>For juveniles, loose substrate, such as sand, should be avoided. There is too great a risk of ingestion either accidentally or out of curiosity, and this can lead to intestinal impaction. Paper towels or reptile carpet can be used instead.</p><p>For adults, washed play sand (not fine silica sand) can be used, though paper towels or reptile carpet works fine, too. Do not use wood shavings,corn cob, walnut shell, or other substrates that could cause problems if swallowed.If sand is used, feces can be scooped outwith a cat litter scoop. Sand allows bearded dragons to dig and burrow, which they enjoy.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>In the wild, bearded dragons are omnivores, eating a mixture of invertebrate and vertebrate prey, including insects and smaller animals as well as plant material. In captivity,they should be fed a combination of insects and vegetables. Bearded dragons generally should be fed at least once every 24 hours, depending on their age. Baby bearded dragons often eat three times per day. Consult your veterinarian for the proper quantity of food, as this largely depends on your animal's size.</p><p>Crickets that are fed to a bearded dragon should not be very large, especially for baby bearded dragons. Never feed any items bigger than the distance between the bearded dragon's eyes. For adult bearded dragons, you can offer a wider range of insects, such as waxworms, silkworms,butterworms, red worms, earthworms, newly molted mealworms, andsuperworms. Pinkie mice can also occasionally be offered to adults.</p><p>Insects should begut loaded (fed nutritious foods that pass to your pet) and lightly dusted with calcium and vitamin D supplements toprevent metabolic bone disease. Dust with a complete multivitamin no more than once a week.</p><p>In addition to insects, bearded dragons should befed a mixture of leafy greens and other vegetables and fruits. These items can be chopped and mixed together to make a salad, which can be fed in a shallow bowl. Leafy greens can also be clipped to the side of the enclosure.</p><p>Provide water to your bearded dragon in a shallow dish. If your dragon enjoys soaking in the water, you can offer a larger dish for it to climb into occasionally.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>One of the most serious ailments affecting bearded dragons is metabolic bone disease. This is the result of an imbalanced calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. It can lead to a softening of the bones, making them prone to fractures.</p><p>Like other reptiles, bearded dragons also are susceptible to respiratory infections. Symptoms commonly include wheezing or excess mucus around the nostrils and mouth.</p><p>Furthermore, bearded dragons are prone to impaction of the digestive system, often due to certain insects in their diet. This is especially true with crunchy bugs, such as mealworms. So it is best to feed these in limited quantities, especially to juvenile bearded dragons.</p><h2>Choosing Your Bearded Dragon </h2><p>Virtually all bearded dragons available in the United States are captive-bred, as Australia has strict laws against the exportation of its wildlife. This is ideal because wild-caught animals often fail to thrive in captivity. Bearded dragons are easily found from reputable breeders or rescue organizations. Young dragons often cost around $50 while adults can cost around $100.</p><p>Select a bearded dragon that is active with healthy-looking skin. Some red flags include swollen joints; discharge around the eyes, nose, or mouth; discolored skin; and runny droppings.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Bearded Dragon </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your new pet.</p><p>Shine a flashlightthe one on your phone works just finethrough the bearded dragon's tail. If it has two bumps inside, it's a male. One, and its female.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why your bearded dragon isn't eating. If it's winter, it could be going through something called brumation. That's when it has a period of dormancy and hides in its substrate. Your dragon might also be starting to shed its skin, and you may notice it has a papery appearance.</p><p><br/></p><p>Does your bearded dragon get enough UVB light? Without it, they will have bone loss, and not have appetites. Your dragon might also be cold; so check to make sure its enclosure is heated correctly.</p><p><br/></p><p>If it's none of these, you might want to make a call to your exotics veterinarian, to find the root cause and fix it.</p><p>Bearded dragons need to be bathed a couple of times per week. Bathwater should be no deeper than its knees, with water that's 85 to 92 degrees F. All you need to do is splash water on the dragon and let it enjoy itself in the water, no soaps are needed! After about 20 minutes, remove it from the bath and pat it dry. Get it back under its warm lights to make sure it stays toasty.</p",1460
44,https://www.thesprucepets.com/three-toed-box-turtle-1238471,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Three-Toed Box Turtle Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Three-Toed Box Turtle Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Found from Missouri south to Texas and Alabama, the three-toed box turtle is named for the three toes on its hind feet; the other box turtles have four. These handsome, classic-looking turtles are native to the United States and are among the most popular pets for turtle enthusiasts. However, three-toed box turtles (and box turtles in general) aren't especially well-suited to be pets for new turtle owners or in homes with very young children. These animals don't like to be handled and can suffer stress-related health problems if they are picked up. They actually require a significant amount of care compared to other species of turtlesand prefer consistency in their environments; even just a ride to the veterinarian can prove stressful for a box turtle.This is why these turtles should only be taken on by the advanced turtle keeper.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Three-toed box turtle</p><p>Adult Size: 3 1/2 to 5 inches in length</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 100 years in the wild; 30 to 40 years if bred in captivity and receiving proper care; only one year if transferred from the wild</p><p>Three-toed box turtles have a high, domed carapace (dorsal shell) that is usually olive-brown with some yellow markings. On the plastron (ventral or chest shell) there may be dark blotches. The skin is brown with some yellow spots, and the males may have red markings on their heads with occasional red, orange, and black on the neck and forelegs.</p><p>Males often have red or orange markings on the head and sometimes the neck and forelegs. They also have longer, thicker tails than the females. In addition, the plastron is slightly concave in males and flatter in females. Males have red irises, and typically, the claws on the hind feet are shorter and more curved than those on the females.</p><h2>Three-Toed Box Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Three-toed box turtles can live in a wide variety of habitats, from woodlands to meadows, but they are usually found near a water source. They often venture into shallow waters, perhaps more so than the other box turtles.</p><p>In the wild, three-toed box turtles have been observed migrating with the seasons, since they prefer humid environments. Like their cousins, three-toed box turtles hibernate in cold weather; in warmer climates, they stay active.</p><p>It is not unusual for three-toed box turtles to wade into shallow water to drink and have a soak, more so than most North American terrestrial turtles. They also seek out water and soak for long stretches if they feel safe doing so. Three-toed box turtles are more likely to spend extended time in the water than other box turtles. If their environment becomes too dry, three-toed box turtles in the wildmay burrow into leaves or other ground covers to better retain moisture.</p><h2>Housing the Three-Toed Box Turtle </h2><p>If the climate is agreeable they do much better outside. Build your outdoor enclosures on well-draining soil with non-toxic, rot-resistant walls at least 20 inches tall; the wall barrier should also extend down, at least 10 inches underground to prevent your turtles from digging an escape. The minimum size is four feet wide and four feet long but doubling the length to eight feet is preferred.</p><p>This species needs room to roam and dig. While it is possible to keep hatchlings and juveniles in a large indoor terrarium (aquariums are too small), adults need a much bigger space. Eachturtlein your terrarium needs at least three square feet of floor space for every eight inches of shell length. Juveniles need an area that is at least two square feet in dimension.</p><p>Both indoors and outdoors, they should have easy access to available hiding spots and loose-leaf litter in which to burrow. Provide a large shallow pan of clean water at all times, but make sure they can easily get in and out of the water without tipping over into water and potentially drowning.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>When they are kept indoors in a terrarium, maintain the daytime temperature gradient from about 75 F on the cold side to a basking spot with temperatures of 85 to88 F. The nighttime temperature of any part of the enclosure should not drop below 70 F. Use a ceramic heater as a heat source.</p><p>If your turtle is kept in an outdoor pen, make sure there are both sunny and shady areas available, including underneath hideouts. Each turtle should be able to move from cooler to warmer areas as it chooses.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>These turtles need exposure to ultraviolet light to produce vitamin D3so they can properly absorb calcium from their diet. Include a UVB-emitting reptile light. Without it, your turtle will become lethargic, lack an appetite, and can even develop metabolic bone disease (MBD) causing faulty growth and development.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Box turtles are much less likely to develop any kind of infection when kept in a humid environment. Regularly mist their pen or run a sprinkler for added moisture, as even in captivity, three-toed box turtles prefer a bit morehumiditythan others.</p><p>Adding a weak heater above the water bowl will also cause some evaporation for higher humidity. Make sure to always place heaters safely away from your turtle as they do get hot enough to cause burns. Add a hygrometer to the enclosure to ensure that the humidity stays at around 70 to 80 percent.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>These turtles need a moist (but not wet) ground layer, or substrate. Coconut husk fiber (bed-a-beast, eco earth, forest bed, etc.) is an ideal, natural material that retains moisture. Bark chips andclean sandcan be mixed in. Other goodmaterialsinclude cypress mulch, peat moss, ortopsoil mixed withsand. Apply a minimum depth of three inches to allow for digging</p><p>Avoid using Perlite, Vermiculite, and Styrofoam as these cause gut impaction problems when ingested either on purpose or accidentally. Coarse gravel, silica, calcium sand, cat litter, and walnut shells are all associated with causing small scrape lesions on the turtle's exterior that often lead to chronic infection. Also, newspapers with ink, rodent pellet bedding, aspen shaving, pine bark, and cedar are all common pet substrates that are moderately toxic and can cause respiratory problems or even death in reptiles.</p><p>If your living space is very dry and maintaining humidity is a challenge, there is a workaround that works beautifully to maintain constant uniform hydration to the habitat via evaporation. In a waterproof enclosure, first lay down a layer of pea-gravel (medium-sized is best). In one easy-access corner, build up the gravel an extra inch high to act as a downspout or water delivery channel. Then add clean (non-chlorinated) water up to only half the depth of the average gravel depth. Use your chosen substrate material as the top layer. You will have to replenish the evaporated water regularly by adding to the gravel access corner.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>While hatchlings are juveniles are more carnivorous in order to grow, the adult three-toed box turtles are omnivores. Approximately half of their diet should be made up of vegetables, fruit, and hay/grasses; the remainder is made up of low-fat protein sources. Whole live foods are ideal (earthworms, slugs, snails, mealworms, crickets, grasshoppers, small fish, etc) but cooked lean meats and low-fat, high-quality dog food can be added as a supplement.</p><p>In order to prevent captive, non-foraging turtles from becoming obese, the amount to feed should be whatever they will eat in under 10 minutes. If using this schedule, feed your turtle no more than three days per week. If feeding juveniles, feed them only every other day. Only give what they will eat in under 10 minutes; feed in the morning or afternoon, matching the times when your turtle is typically most active.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Respiratory infections are common in these turtles. The signs of a respiratory infection include open-mouthed breathing, wheezing, nasal discharge, and drooling. These can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, but certain conditions make it more likely that an infection will take hold in your turtle: some combination of a deficiency in vitamin A, enclosure air that is too cold or too dry, and malnutrition.</p><p>Vitamin A deficiency is usually the result of a nutrient-poor diet. Although they will eat any leafy greens, some varieties (like iceberg lettuce) just don't have enough of the nutritional value that turtles need.</p><p>Shell rot is the result of either a bacterial or fungal infection. This condition is serious and painful for the turtle and, like other common ailments, should be treated by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. Shell rot sometimes appears following an injury to the turtle's shell.</p><h2>Choosing Your Three-toed Box Turtle </h2><p>Box turtle populations are declining around the world; many U.S. states protect box turtle populations and have laws against collecting box turtles from the wild. Unfortunately, thousands of box turtles are still collected annually to supply the demands of the pet trade. Most of these turtles (which live for decades in the wild) will die within 12 months of capture as all wild-caught specimens do not adjust well to captivity and tend to die from stress.</p><p>It is best to get a box turtle that has been bred in captivity from a reputable breeder, as most will not sell a turtle that has health issues. Any bumps or redness on the shell, mucus in the nasal area or mouth, or cloudy eyes may indicate a turtle with health problems.</p>",1558
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/eastern-box-turtle-1238467,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Eastern Box Turtle: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Eastern Box Turtle: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Eastern box turtles are found in the wild across the eastern United States, though their numbers are dwindling. They live in a wide variety of habitats, from damp forests to dry grassy fields and will often venture into shallow water and hibernate when it gets cold. These turtles have a high-domed shell that's brown with bright yellow, orange, and red markings. As pets, their adaptability to environments makes them fairly easy to house, though they do still require some specialized care.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Eastern box turtle, land turtle</p><p>Adult Size:5 to 7 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 40 to 50 years in captivity with good care (and up to 100 years in the wild)</p><h2>Eastern Box Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Eastern box turtles are typically active during the day, which they naturally spend roaming around foraging for food. Pet box turtles don't usually prefer frequent handling, as this can cause them stress. A common sign of stress is when the turtle completely retreats into its shell. Still, it's important to have regular interactions with themincluding gentle handlingto get them comfortable with your presence. This also helps to minimize their stress when they need to be moved for cage cleanings and veterinary care.</p><p>Many owners say their Eastern box turtles have distinct personalities and are quite social in their own way. They even seem to recognize the voice and appearance of their favorite humans and will beg for food when they see their owner approaching. Some are known to play with toys, such as a small ball.</p><h2>Housing the Eastern Box Turtle </h2><p>Most aquariums are too small for this turtle, though a tank that's at least 20 gallons will work for hatchlings and juveniles. If you plan to keep your turtle indoors, an enclosure that's at least 4 square feet with sides that are at least 18 inches tall is adequate, as long as you can meet the turtle's lighting and heat needs.</p><p>However, if your climate is similar to the turtle's natural environment, an outdoor enclosure is ideal to mimic how it would live in the wild. If you're creating an outdoor pen, make sure it has sunny and shaded areas and is protected from predators and harsh weather. These species like to dig, so provide clean soil to provide enrichment to their enclosure. Also, ensure that all plants and other materials (including lawn chemicals) in the space are safe for your turtle.</p><p>Your turtle should have easy access to two shallow pans of water at all times, both indoors and outdoors, for soaking and for drinking. In addition, you should provide hiding spots and loose litter for burrowing. Refresh the water at least once a day, and remove dirty litter at least weekly with daily spot cleanings.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Eastern box turtles generally prefer a sunny area in their pen where they can bask in temperatures around 85 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as a shaded area that's around 74-80 degrees Fahrenheit. The nighttime temperature should not drop below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. If your outdoor environment can't meet this, you must bring them inside and outfit their pen with a heat lamp.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>The natural outdoor sunlight is best for the turtle's vitamin D production, but if you keep your turtle indoors, you can replicate this with a UVB-emitting reptile light. These lightbulbs should be on for 10 to 12 hours per day, and they typically must be changed every six months; their UV output diminishes and will stop even if the light still switches on. Follow the instructions on your particular light for best results.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>The Eastern box turtle prefers a humid environment that mimics a moist forest floor. Maintain at least 70-80% humidity with daily misting or investing in an automatic fogger. Placing the shallow pool of water in the turtle's habitat also helps with humidity.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Use substrate, or bedding for the bottom of their pen, that mirrors their natural environment. Mulch, pelleted, or moss-type substrates are all suitable, especially because they help to retain moisture and increase the habitat's humidity. Ensure that the substrate is deep enough for burrowing and always moist for humidity to be correct for this species.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Eastern box turtles are omnivores and eat a variety of foods in the wild. Their diet in captivity should come as close to their natural one as possible. Feed them roughly every 24 hours and tend to feed in the morning when they are most active. Approximately half of their daily diet should be vegetables, some fruit, and hay or grasses. They tend to like brightly colored produce, such as tomatoes, carrots, and red bell peppers.</p><p>The remainder of their daily diet should come from low-fat protein sources. Whole live foods are ideal (e.g., earthworms, slugs, snails, mealworms, crickets, and grasshoppers), young turtles typically need more protein than adults for growth. Consult your veterinarian for the exact quantity your turtle should eat, based on its age and size. Also, consider providing a multivitamin to your box turtle's daily diet on its insects and salads for overall nutritional balancing.</p><p>A shallow pan of fresh water should be provided at all times. Although they're not aquatic turtles, they do have a tendency to wade in their water dish. This is why it's important to watch out for droppings in the water, and refresh it as needed throughout the day.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Eastern box turtles are a long-term commitment, and routine veterinary care is key to ensuring they live as long as possible in captivity. Even if your turtle appears healthy, visit an exotic animal veterinarian at least once a year for a wellness check. It's often recommended to have an annual fecal exam and bloodwork done for parasites and overall health information, especially if your turtle lives outside. Gastrointestinal parasites are a common health issue these animals face, with symptoms including poor appetite and abnormal feces.</p><p>Respiratory infections also are frequently seen in Eastern box turtles. Symptoms include labored breathing, bubbles in the mouth or nose, and mucus around the eyes and nose. An environment that is too cold or dry often is the culprit of these infections.</p><p>Furthermore, some box turtles develop problems with their shells, such as shell rot or ulcers. Symptoms include abnormal-looking or foul-smelling patches on the shell. This is often due to a poor diet or unsanitary habitat.</p><p>In terms of behavior, Eastern box turtles are generally more shy than aggressive until they're comfortable in their environment. Be gentle with them, and they will learn to trust you and even seem to enjoy your company.</p><h2>Choosing Your Eastern Box Turtle </h2><p>Many states have laws against collecting box turtles from the wild for the pet trade, but there are still many pet stores that sell wild-caught turtles. These wild-caught turtles typically don't adjust well to captivity, and many die from the stress. It's best to get a pet box turtle bred in captivity from a reputable breeder or visit a rescue group. In fact, rescue groups often have many to choose from because owners were not able to keep the animal for its full lifespan. The average price for an Eastern box turtle ranges from around $50 to $300, depending on its age.</p><p>When selecting a turtle, make sure it is active and alert, and note whether it's eating normally. Its shell should be hard with no abnormalities, and its eyes should be clear and bright. Some red flags include discharge around the eyes, nose, or mouth and a soft shell that collapses when gentle pressure is applied. Look out for lethargy or abnormal feces, too.</p>",1283
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/box-turtles-as-pets-1237255,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Common Box Turtle: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Common Box Turtle: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Box turtles primarily live on land, and they can be somewhat challenging pets. They are a long-term commitment, living for several decades, plus getting their environment right can be difficult.</p><p>There are several species of box turtle, and each has variations in itshousing and dietary needs. Some prefer more humid enclosures than others; some need higher temperatures; some like to bask, and one variety even prefers brackish (slightly salty) water to fresh water.</p><p>Native to North America, the common box turtle has a high-domed upper shell that's primarily brown patterned with yellow or orange. It features a rather small head with a hooked upper jaw and tends to be an interesting pet with a distinctive personality.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Common box turtle</p><p>Adult Size: 4 to 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy:20 to 40 years (or longer)</p><h2>Common Box Turtle Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Box turtles aren't considered suitable pets for young children or for new pet owners. This is due to their complex care requirements, as well as their susceptibility to stress, which can greatly affect a turtle's health. Expect to spend your time cleaning and maintaining their enclosure at least weekly, as well as feeding them every day or two.</p><p>Box turtles like consistency in their surroundings, and most prefer not to be handled by people. They don't typically bite, but anxiety from overhandling can lead some to nip a person. Moreover, they can carry salmonella, so it's important to thoroughly wash your hands if you do handle your turtle or anything in its environment.Once they're comfortable in their environment, most box turtles will learn to recognize their keepers, even following a person's movements from inside their enclosure or begging for food.</p><h2>Housing the Common Box Turtle </h2><p>Box turtles do best in a turtle-safe outdoor pen that mimics their natural environment, as long as temperatures don't fall below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. The pen should have walls that are at least 18 inches tall with an overhang to prevent the turtle from climbing out. It should include sunny and shady areas, places to hide, and access to a shallow water dish. Plus, it should be protected from predators.</p><p>If you can't keep your turtle outdoors year-round in your climate, try to do so for at least part of the year. It's difficult for indoor box turtles to thrive. If kept indoors, use a terrarium that's at least 40 gallons. Many owners also turn plastic children's pools, sandboxes, and other large tubs into indoor turtle housing. An indoor setup will require considerable space and effort to create the appropriate environment for a box turtle. Plan to equip the enclosure with a heat source, UV lighting, places to hide, and a shallow water dish.</p><p>Box turtles might hibernate if their enclosure is allowed to drop in temperature or if they are housed outdoors. But before you allow your box turtle to hibernate, you must ensure it is in good health. If an unhealthy box turtle hibernates, it might not wake up. That's because bodily functions slow during hibernation, so box turtles that are sick will potentially be unable to fight the illness while in their deep sleep.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Common box turtles require daytime temperatures of around 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a basking spot that's around 85 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. At night, the temperature can drop to between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Opt for a basking lamp, as well as ceramic heat emitters or other heat sources, to help regulate the temperature.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB lighting is essential for box turtles to metabolize the calcium in their diets. Without it, they can develop metabolic bone disease and even die. Box turtles need around 12 hours of UVB lighting per day either via natural sunlight or a UVB lamp. When indoors, be sure to turn off the lamp at night to mimic a natural day-night cycle.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Box turtles prefer a humidity level of around 60%. You can maintain this through daily misting, as well as by using a substrate that retains some moisture.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the material that lines the bottom of your box turtle's enclosure. It helps to maintain humidity and satisfy the turtle's desire to burrow. Plus, it can make the enclosure look and feel more natural. Thus, aim to use a substrate that mimics the turtle's natural environment. Many owners opt for chemical-free topsoil, leaves, and moss. Layer it at least 4 inches deep to allow your turtle to burrow.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Because box turtles are omnivores, they need a varied diet. Keeping them outside allows them to supplement what you feed them with what's in the environment.Fresh vegetables, fruits, insects, low-fat meats, and pinky mice are some foods that can be offered. There are also commercial diets available for box turtles, though you should supplement those with fresh foods.</p><p>Place the food on a plate, paver, or another surface to prevent the turtle from ingesting its substrate.Most young turtles need feeding every 24 hours while some adults might eat every other day. Consult your vet on the correct proportions for your individual turtle. Clean water in a shallow dish should be provided at all times.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>The most serious ailment among many turtles is metabolic bone disease due to insufficient UVB exposure. This painful condition can leadto weakened bones and death.</p><p>Respiratory infections, usually from insufficient humidity or low temperatures, are also common among box turtles. Symptoms include wheezing, mucus around the mouth and nose, lethargy, and a lack of appetite. If your turtle experiences frequent respiratory infections, it could be a sign of vitamin A deficiency. Avoid feeding iceberg lettuce to a turtle with a respiratory infection.The animals love it, but it has almost no nutritional value.</p><p>Box turtles also are prone to parasitic infections. (Captive-bred varieties are at a much lower risk.) This type of infection doesn't always show obvious signs but can be diagnosed by a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p><p>In addition, box turtles can contract a painful condition known as shell rot, which is caused by a bacterial or fungal infection. The shell will appear cracked or dry, and it might emit an unpleasant odor.</p><p>All of these ailments should receive treatment by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing Your CommonBox Turtle </h2><p>Around the world, box turtle populations are declining. Because of this, many states have laws against keeping wild box turtles as pets. The population decline is just one reason to get a captive-bred pet box turtle from a reputable breeder or rescue organization. Another good reason is you'll be able to learn about the turtle's history and any health issues. Plus, wild-caught turtles generally don't adjust well to captivity and often die from stress.</p><p>Know what to look for to ensure you're adopting a healthy turtle. Any bumps or redness on the shell, mucus in the nasal area or mouth, or cloudy eyes can indicate a turtle with health problems. Plus, make sure the turtle has a firm shell and no swelling on its body. It's also best to avoid purchasing a box turtle during the fall or winter when it should be hibernating.

47,https://www.thesprucepets.com/whites-tree-frog-1236816,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>White's Tree Frog Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>White's Tree Frog Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The White's tree frog is a green or blue-green frog native to Australia, Indonesia,and New Guinea. It's a popular frog because of its petite size and facial expressions, which include sleepy-looking eyes and a smiling mouth. Its skin also has a waxy coating that allows it to tolerate more arid conditions than other common tree frog species, making it a better match for home environments. A White's tree frog is a good choice for a beginning frog owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: White's tree frog,dumpy tree frog</p><p>Adult Size: Three to five inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: Typically up to 16 years, although 21 years has been reported</p><h2>White's Tree Frog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>White's tree frogs are nocturnal, which means they are more active in the evening and night hours. These frogs arequite sedentary and docile; they often become fairly tame and tolerant of handling.</p><p>However, all amphibians have very absorbent skin that will take up chemicals easily, so extreme care is needed when handling them. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and rinse well with non-chlorinated water, preferably tank water;even the natural oils and salts found on human skin are damaging. Do not use lotions or even soaps before handling your pet as the residues they leave behind are also toxic to frogs.</p><h2>Housing the White's Tree Frog </h2><p>White's tree frogsin the wild spend most of theirtime in treesso they need an enclosure with lots of climbing enrichment. A tall or high 15 to 20 gallon aquarium is recommended for housing one adult frog. A hexagonal tank is optimal.</p><p>A tight-fitting lid is essential, as these frogs have suctioning footpads that will let them easily scale the glass walls of an aquarium. You can keep more than one frog together in a single habitat, as long as they are of similar size; otherwise, your larger frogs may attempt to eat the smaller ones.</p><p>A piece of paper a few inches tall placed around the outside of the bottom of the tank may help if the frogs tend to rub their nose along the glass in an attempt to wander beyond the habitat; frogs don't understand transparent barriers as much as you'd hope (they will try to move toward objects they can see), but they do understand black walls.</p><p>Provide many branches, large pieces of cork bark, and foliage for climbing, keeping in mind that these surfaces need to be quite sturdy to support the weight of thesestockyfrogs. Use natural live plants that are hefty and strong-stemmed. Make certain that they are free of fertilizer or pesticide residues on the plant and in all plant soils. Live plants in the terrarium should be kept in small, moveable pots to makecleaningthe tank easier.</p><p>Covering the back surface of the tank with dark paper helps the frog find a secluded and dimly lit area to sleep during daylight hours. Placing a large piece of bark diagonally across the cage, a few inches from the back wall will allow the frog to cling to the back of the tank under the cover of the bark to sleep. Alternatively, use any sort of thick plant cover or interior place with many exits to allow the frog to hide out and rest.</p><p>Spot-clean your frog's cage every day, wiping off any large bits of waste matter from the plant leaves and the bottom of the tank. Use non-chlorinated water to change the water dish daily.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Placed a basking light or heater outside of only one side of the cage to create a gradient of 80 to 86 F (27 to 30 C) during the day, with a drop to 72 to 78 F (22 to 25 C) at night. Use both hand-held and tank-side sticker thermometers to confirm that appropriate temperatures are being maintained.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Lighting should be subdued, and if a light is needed at night, use only a nocturnal bulb. Create a regular light-dark cycle; 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark works well. These frogs are nocturnal, so there are no special lighting requirements. Exposure to UVB is not necessary, although some exposure won't hurt your White's tree frogs.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Even in the case of this arboreal frog, building a good substrate in the enclosure will help to create and maintain an environment similar to its native warm and wet tropical habitat. Build the foundation of the floor of the tank with large-sized washed gravel covered by chemical-free soil. Large pieces of bark can then be used for more foundation; cover any exposed soil with sphagnum moss, which helps to retain the moisture that will provide humidity these amphibians need.</p><p>Avoid small-sized gravel or shavings of bark that frogs might accidentally ingest. Some keepers prefer a barer approach for temporary tanks, by simply lining the tank with paper or paper towels to facilitate cleaning. However, it is much harder to maintain theappropriatehumidity with this minimal floor covering.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Use a hygrometer inside the tank to measure the relative humidity; as hygrometer meter readings can drift over time, calibrate them once annually. Maintain the humidity for this frog's enclosure at 60 to 70 percent by misting daily with dechlorinated or bottled (not distilled) water. A dish of the same water should also be provided. To off-gas any dissolved gases, and to come up to room temperature, allow all water that will be used in the enclosure to sit in an open container at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>Do not use fresh tap water with frogs and other amphibians, due to the presence of chlorine and chloramine used in the water purification process. If a chlorinated source of water must be used, treat it first with a dechlorination kit (available atpet stores). Alternatively, bottled water can be used, but never use distilled water as it lacks the essential minerals that all animals need in their water.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Feed your White's tree frogs a diet primarily of live crickets. Other live foods can include insecticide-free moths, beetles, cockroaches, grasshoppers, and earthworms. Fully grown White's tree frogs may even take pinkie mice on occasion. Place live insects in the cageor offer them using blunt-tip or flexible-tip forceps, but make sure the forceps will not injure the frog's mouth or tongue on impact.</p><p>The amount of food your frog needs will vary somewhat, but keep in mind that White's tree frogs tend toward having obesity issues, so do not overfeed. As a very general guideline, feed large frogs (greater than three inches long) a few large crickets every two to three days, adjusting based on the frog's activity and body condition. Offer smaller frogs three-week-old crickets roughly every two to three days, and feed juveniles daily.</p><p>The best way to judge how much to feed is by looking at the frog's body condition. Look for ridges just above the frog's eardrum. If there are no noticeable ridges, the frog is likely underweight and should be fed a larger volume or more often. If the ridges become prominent and start to sag or fold over, then the frog is obese: reduce feedings by no more than 50 percent.</p><p>All insects fed to amphibians must first be gut loaded with nutritious foods. In addition, it is important to dust the prey items with a calcium-vitamin supplement. Perform this dusting only once a week for mature frogs, two or three times a week for mid-sized frogs, and daily in very young frogs.</p><p>Frogs like to get into their water dish to rehydrate and soak, so use a dish that is large enough that the frog can comfortably sit in the dish, but not too deep that there is a risk of drowning; tree frogs are not strong swimmers.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>The most serious threat to the White's tree frog's health is a disease known aschytridiomycosis, which is caused by the chytrid fungus. This fatal disease spreads quickly in the wild and has caused a large decline in the populations of most amphibians worldwide. This disease is characterized by lethargy and weight loss; few treatments are available.</p><h2>Choosing Your White's Tree Frog </h2><p>Chytrid fungus exposure is the main reason whyit's important to buy your White's tree frog only from reputable breeders who will verify that your pet has been captive bred and is free of disease. As with many exotic pets, White's tree frogs that are bred in captivity are the more robust animals when it comes to the captive environment. Frogs caught in the wild may not handle the stresses of captivity well.</p><p>Wild-caught amphibians may also bring parasites or other infections to your habitat. Reptile shows and online breeders are a good place to start when looking for a new pet amphibian.However, avoid buying any frog you haven't had the chance to see in person; ideally, you should be able to watch it eat to make sure it has a healthy appetite which is a sign of good health.</p><h2>Similar Species to the White's Tree Frog </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other types of reptiles and amphibians that can be your pet!</p><p>Very popular, as they're both easy to care for  an exotic pet!</p><p>Like many other frogs and amphibians, White's tree frogs may carry Salmonella and Ranavirus.</p><p>Very!

They have a light white or cream-colored stripe from the side of the head down to the flanks.</p><p>American green tree frogs are small. Their skin is porous and not recommended for much handling, but they are one of the easier frogs to care for even for a novice.Maintaining the right environment for these hardy amphibians is not too difficult, but you will need to devote at least an hour each week to clean out the habitat.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: American green tree frog</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 2 1/2 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 5 years</p><h2>American Green Tree Frog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These small frogs are timid and do not tolerate handling; they are squirmy and will resist it. Some frogs, after many years in captivity, may grow to accept it. But like most frogs, their skin is delicate and continuous hand contact can damage their skin.</p><p>Do not plan on keeping this frog's habitat in your bedroom. As nocturnal creatures, the males are especially active and vocal at night.American green tree frogs are not cuddly pets, but they are fun to watch. Their big eyes seem to look longingly at a spot, and their mouths always appear to be perpetually smiling.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Cute and Shy American Green Tree Frog</h3><h2>Housing the American Green Tree Frog </h2><p>A minimum 10-gallon tank is suitable as a terrarium for green tree frogs, although larger works well too. Frogs are arboreal, spending most of their time in trees.The height of the cage is more important than the floor space, so a tall tank is best. Get a secure mesh or wire cover to prevent escape.</p><p>Climbing is essential for this species. Provide a variety of branches, live plants, or artificial vegetation. Ensure any wood collected from the outdoors is pesticide-free. You will need to treat or sanitize harvested wood to remove harmful bacteria or bugs. Driftwood and cork bark also make suitable cage furnishings.</p><p>Unlike many other frog species, the American green tree frog doesn't require any special heating considerations, unless it drops lower than 70 degrees Fahrenheit in your home. It's entirely nocturnal, and no supplemental ultraviolet light is needed.It will, however, need a humid environment.</p><p>Thoroughly clean the enclosure once a week. Do not use soap as detergents can kill your frog. Make sure your hands are clean (but not recently soap-cleaned) or use latex-free gloves. Gently place the frogs in a small container.</p><p>Take everything out, rinsing and scrubbing under hot water. The tank itself will need to be cleaned too (with hot water, no soap). As for the bedding, use washable liners, such as reptile carpeting or washable coconut fiber mats. You can use a gentle laundry detergent for the liner, but it must be rinsed thoroughly with cold clean water. To cut your cleaning time, have two pieces of tank liners, so when one is dirty, you will always have a clean one ready for use.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>The temperature needs of this frog are similar to humans; they thrive at temperatures from 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. As these creatures are cold-blooded, they need to regulate their internal body temperature. They do this by moving around in their cage to cool down or get warm. Provide a thermal gradient or range of temperatures in the cage. You can do this by putting a ceramic heat emitter in one corner or end of the cage. The temperature should not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit in that warm spot.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>This animal is nocturnal and will likely sleep during the day. It does not require lights, but a UVB fluorescent light tube (5.0) can be beneficial but not necessary for this species. The invisible ultraviolet rays may help your frog metabolize calcium.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Humidity should be around 50 to 60 percent during daytime and spike to 80 to 100 percent at nighttime. Never let the humidity level fall below 50 percent at any time. A hygrometer or humidity gauge will help you check moisture levels. Automated misters and foggers can provide moisture on a timer if you are not home to mist your cage regularly with a spray bottle.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the bedding or lining for the bottom of your pet's cage. The safest, easiest, and most economically efficient choices are reptile carpet or a coconut fiber mat. These are easily washable and safer since your frog cannot mistakenly ingest it.</p><p>However, you can still use other substrates, such as cypress mulch or organic soil, moss, cork bark, or smooth gravel. You can try to clean small gravel every week, but it would require boiling to sanitize it adequately, so it's best to replace it entirely every week. If your frog seems to be eating some of its substrate with its insect meal, consider switching to a reptile carpet or a coconut fiber mat which can prevent health issues down the road.</p><h2>Terrarium Plants </h2><p>When selecting plants for your frog's cage, get plants that thrive in a similar climate: temperatures in the 70s, high humidity, and lower light. Also, make sure your plant selections are not toxic to amphibians. Your best options will be sturdy ferns or .</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><h3>What Is a Tree Frog's Diet?</h3><p>A tree frog's diet includes the food and nutrients it needs to thrive. As insectivores, tree frogs can eat insects like crickets, fruit flies, houseflies, ants, moths, and worms to maintain a healthy diet.</p><p>American green tree frogs are generally good eaters and exclusively eat insects. Crickets can make up the bulk of a green tree frog's diet. The crickets should be gut-loadedfed a high-protein, nutritious meal before being offered to the frogand dusted with a calcium and multivitamin supplement a couple of times a week.</p><p>Tree frogs will likely eat more in the spring and summer months than in the winter. Feed smaller frogs daily, while larger frogs can be fed daily or every other day. Expect to feed three or four insects per feeding. Do not overdo it. Frogs are opportunistic feeders and can grow obese. If it appears that your frog is getting obese, cut back on the number of feedings per week. If your frog appears overweight, it could also benefit from more space to move around and get exercise.</p><p>Provide a large, shallow, sturdy water dish with dechlorinated water. It must be shallow since these frogs are not good swimmers. Mist the cage daily with dechlorinated water to maintain humidity. Frogs absorb water from the habitat's ambient moisture through their skin. They also may drink water droplets on plants or tank walls.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>As with most amphibians, bacterial and fungal infections of the skin and eyes are common ailments. Pus (which may look cheesy), swelling, or redness are signs of disease. Although less common in frogs than in other reptiles and amphibians, respiratory infections can occur in frogs that haveenclosures with inadequate or too much humidity. Symptoms of a respiratory infection include wheezing, drooling, and general lethargy.</p><p>If your frog is not eating well and shows no other apparent symptoms, it may have a parasitic infection. Usually, this needs to be diagnosed by an exotics veterinarian who specializes in reptiles and amphibians.</p><p>The vet should take a yearly fecal sample to check that your frog doesn't have an overgrowth of usual parasites. Also, pet frogs are susceptible to ammonia poisoning, which is a potentially fatal condition that occurs when wastes accumulate in an animal's enclosure. Ammonia build-up can be prevented by regular, weekly cleaning.</p><p>All of these ailments can be treated by a qualified vet if caught early.</p><h2>Choosing Your American Green Tree Frog </h2><p>Frogs can make lovely pets, but frogs in the wild are facing population declines and extinction due to human encroachment. If you take in a wild-caught frog as a pet, it may have diseases or health issues.</p><p>Buy a locally captive-bred frog from a reputable breeder and make sure it is tested free of disease. You can usually find a breeder through an exotics veterinarian, another frog owner, or a reptile expo. Reptile shows typically have amphibians on display and for sale, too. Most American green tree frogs cost about $10.</p><p>Look for an active, alert animal that has clear eyes with skin that looks free of bumps or cuts. If you can watch it eat before deciding, that's ideal; most frogs will not refuse food unless they're unwell.Likewise, if the frog you are considering seemslethargic or is having trouble breathing, or if its abdomen seems bloated, these may be signs of illness.</p>",1531

They have three clawed toes on their back feet that they use to tear at decaying food. These frogs are plentiful in ponds and rivers within the south-eastern portion of Sub-Saharan Africa (NigeriaandSudantoSouth Africa). Populations have also been introduced into isolatedplaces in North America, South America, and Europe. The requirements of these totallyaquatic frogs are much like keeping a communal, tropical freshwater fish tank. They are easy to care for and good for a ""look only"" beginner frog keeper but their aquatic tank will require maintenance, and handling them is not a good idea.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Dwarf clawed frog, Zaire clawed frog</p><p>Scientific Names: </p><p>Adult Size: Dwarf clawed frogs reach an adult size of about 1 to 1 1/2 inches long.</p><p>Life Expectancy:5 years</p><h2>Dwarf Clawed Frog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These pet frogs require little interaction from their owners. Feeding and changing the water are the main duties of the owner, so they are relatively easy to care for. However, these are not like other pet frogs in that they should not be handled much if at all. Being full water dwellers like fish, they are accustomed to a weightless environment; their skeletal systems do not hold themselves up well when exposed to normal gravity. In fact, any frogs that leap out of the tank will die.</p><p>They can be kept in groups as well as within a community of tropical fish. The fish should be of a similar size to the frogs. If the fish are smaller, the frogs may try to eat them; if the fish are larger, they may try to eat the frogs. They can be kept in groups or with peaceful community fish that are approximately the same sizebut be sure to increase the size of thetank accordingly.Don't overcrowd your frog's tank, however, because such conditions stress them and can lead to health issues.</p><p>Adulthood is reached at about nine months. Males develop glands that looklike small pink or white bumps behind the front legs. The males will also sing or hum when trying to attract a mate. The females tend to be slightly larger than the males and have a more prominent bump between the hind legs, where the cloaca is located.</p><p>Dwarf clawed frogs use their hands to shove food in their mouths. The frogs are vulture-like scavengers that will prey on almost anything living, dying, or dead and any type of organic waste; they use their sensitive fingers and sense of smell to find food.</p><h2>Housing the Dwarf Clawed Frog </h2><p>These frogs are easier to care for than a typical fish tank as they require less life support equipment, however, they do require a heavy aquarium setup. Your dwarf clawed frog tank will need to be on a sturdy floor that can support the weight of water, the tank, and the tank stand. Water filtration systems can be used but are not mandatory; unlike with fish, frequent water changes can be sufficient to keep the water clean enough for air-breathing frogs.</p><p>Living primarily at the bottom of their tanks, these frogs do need to be able to surface for air occasionally. Dwarf clawed frogs do not need a huge tank; allow about a gallon per frog. Avoid tall, deep tanks as the frogs need to easily get to the surface to breathe. Leave a pocket of air between the top of the water and the tank lid. Also, a tight-fitting lid is a necessity as these frogs will try to escape. Dwarf clawed frogs should be kept at temperatures in the range of 75 to 80 F (24 to 27 C).</p><p>These frogs like to have hiding spots, so use live plants or silk ones in the tank. Also, you can provide hiding places using aquarium decorations, driftwood, or small terra cotta plant pots placed on their sides.Any decorations, including artificial plants, must be smooth so as not to damage the frogs' delicate skin. Providing a landing area or a source of drinking water is not requiredas dwarf frogsare completely aquatic.</p><p>Make sure never to use any kind of soap or cleaning chemicals to clean the tank or any buckets or other implements used in tank maintenance. Amphibians have very porous skin and can be easily poisoned by chemicals and detergents. Dwarf clawed frogs should also not be handled because the oils and salts from human hands are also a hazard. If you must catch frogs to move them, use a plastic pitcher to scoop them up along with some water or put on powder-free, non-reactive nitrile surgical gloves.</p><p>Use only dechlorinated water in the tank and conditioner drops from the pet store. Filtration is not strictly necessary if you keep only frogs in the tank; frequent partial water changes will suffice. If you add fish to the tank, a filter will be necessary. Use one that disturbs the water as little as possible as frogs prefer still water, and assure the frogs cannot get stuck inside or behind the intake/filter or they could easily be drowned.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>The main reason for using a gravel ground covering (substrate) in the tank is to provide your frogs a more natural-looking habitat; gravel also helps to secure the base of plants and other tank furnishings. Use sand or smooth gravel on the bottom of the tank. Do not use very large gravel or stone as your frogs may get their legs trapped between the gravel pieces.</p><p>Also, be sure that the frogs are not ingesting the sand or gravel when feeding. If this occurs, you can try a different size of gravel, or employ a small saucer on top of the gravel. This smart solution involves using forceps or a dropper to place the food items directly onto the smooth surface of the underwater saucer.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Dwarf clawed frogs are bottom feeders so they should be fed sinking foods. Live or frozen foods or freeze-dried foods can be used, and rotating through a variety works best. Bloodworms, tubifex worms, daphnia, brine shrimp, blackworms, or chopped (bite-sized) earthworms will be accepted. Dwarf clawed frogs gulp the food and swallow it whole. These frogs rarely accept flaked food; some will accept pelleted food (frog-specific pellets), but these dissolving items can quickly foul the water. Your pet dwarf clawed frogs should be fed once or twice a day.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavioral Problems </h2><p>Healthy frogs are active swimmers that hide frequently and have clear eyes and smooth skin.However, these amphibians are prone to two types of infections: bacterial and fungal. The signs of the more serious type, the fungal infection, includes a white growth that resembles cotton on the skin, as well as discolored eyes.</p><p>Systemically, captive frogs often get a disease called dropsy or bloat; medically, the condition is known as edema, hydropsy, bloat, or ascites. Amphibian experts don't yet understand this disease, but it is thought to be related to some imbalance of the lymphatic system causing and inability to drain body fluids which then build up. Frogs with the bloat look like overfilled balloons. Water quality and dissolved mineral levels might be related.</p><p>If a pet frog has a bacterial infection, it may be due to poor water quality in the tank. A bacterial infection is marked by cloudy eyesand redness or sores on the skin. Both conditions require immediate attention from an aquatic veterinarian and, if not treated, will eventually be fatal.</p><h2>Choosing Your Dwarf Clawed Frog </h2><p>Frogs can makelovely pets, but frogs in the wild are facing population declines and extinction largely as a result of human activities. Unfortunately,the pet tradeis likely contributing to the worldwide amphibian extinction crisis along with the spread of a devastating infection by Chytrid fungus.</p><p>For this reason, you should only buy frogs that you are sure are captive-bred locally and tested to show that they are free of disease. It may be impossible to find frogs that meet these conditions, but otherwise, wild-caught pet frogs may be contributing to the decline of wild frog populations.</p><h2>Similar Species to Dwarf Clawed Frogs </h2><p>Dwarf clawed frogs are often confused with African dwarf frogs. Dwarf frogs have four webbed feet; clawed frogs have webbed back feet but non-webbed digits on their front feet.While they are sometimes light in color, the albino variation is limited to only the larger African clawed frogs, not the dwarf clawed frogs.JuvenileAfrican clawed frogsare similar can sometimes be mistaken for dwarf frogs.</p><p>The differences aren't just in the claws. The clawed frog has eyes on the top of its head, while the dwarf frog's eyes are on the side of its head. Clawed frogs have flat snouts while dwarf frogs have pointed snouts.</p>",1465
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-frogs-1236814,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>Leopard Frogs (Meadow Frogs): Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Leopard Frogs (Meadow Frogs): Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Named for thedark spots on their backs, leopard or meadow frogs are small, semiaquatic frogs; there are more than 20 species of them. They are fascinating to observe but do not like handling. Leopard frogs are excellent pets for inexperienced frog owners. All leopard frog species are relatively easy to care for, although they do require regular cage maintenance of least two hours per week.</p><p>The most common variety kept as a pet is the northern leopard frog, which is bright green with brown spots. The southern leopard frog is another common pet species that is olive green or light brown with dark spots. The plains leopard frog or Blair's leopard frog is brown with dark spots, although it is rare to find as a pet. Their native habitat range extends from temperate and subtropical North America to northern Mexico.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Leopard frog, northern leopard frog, southern leopard frog, plains leopard frog, Blair's leopard frog, meadow frog</p><p>Scientific Name: genus</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 5 years, depending on species</p><h2>Leopard Frog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These cute frogs sometimes come out during the day but are primarily nocturnal. While they may try to eat anything they can swallow (which also includes other frogs), their main diet consists of insects. They're somewhat timid and do not like being held much, hiding below the water when they feel threatened.</p><p>They are harmless to humans and do not produce toxins. However, like all reptiles and amphibians, they can have salmonella which is a harmful bacteria to people. Wear gloves when handling and wash hands thoroughly. Be prepared to take them in and out of their cage at least once a week to clean their cage.</p><p>Be advised these frogs can jump up to 3 feet given their powerful hind legs. Domesticated frogs aren't as likely to jump, but if they feel threatened, they may try to leap away.</p><h2>Housing the Leopard Frog </h2><p>A 10- to 20-gallon tank is sufficient for a single leopard frog, but if you are keeping more than one, increase the tank by 10 gallons per frog. For this species of frog, floor space is more important than height. Leopard frogs are semiaquatic and need land area as well as sufficient water to submerge their bodies.</p><p>A half-land, half-water tank is an excellent choice for leopard frogs. You can separate the tank into zones with Plexiglas. A thick piece of wood such asdriftwood can be placed partly in the water and partly on land to provide a smooth transition from water to land. This piece of wood can also double as a suitable basking spot. Alternately, smooth gravel or flat rocks can be stacked on the aquatic side to provide a ramp out of the water. Smooth gravel is less likely to cause skin abrasions and injuries, and ideally, the gravel should be large enough that the small frogs cannot swallow it.</p><p>If possible, use a removable water container on the water side that is easy to put in and take out for cleaning every two to three days. Avoid using a water filter, instead, do a 50 percent water change regularly (at least twice weekly, perhaps more). Some experts believe that constant water vibrations from a water filtration pump can cause sensory overload in frogs.</p><p>Every other week, you will need to clean the enclosure thoroughly with hot water. Do not use soap as detergent residues can kill frogs. Remove and replace the substrate and clean the walls and bottom of the tank.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>The tank should be kept between 70 to 75 degrees F during the day. However, a temperature drop at night is a good idea, down to about 60 F (about 16 C). As these creatures are cold-blooded, they need to regulate their internal body temperature. They do this by moving around in their cage to cool down or get warm. Provide a thermal gradient or range of temperatures in the cage. You can do this by providing a basking spot or warm area that goes up to 80 F at one end of the cage. Use a ceramic heat emitter, nocturnal heat light, or under tank heating pad to provide a temperature variant.</p><p>Leopard frogs hibernate, so in the winter, they will slow down and may stop eating for about three months. If possible, cool the habitat from 37 to 39 F for the winter months to mimic the frog's natural environment.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>As they are mostly nocturnal, ultraviolet or UVB light is not required, although it can be beneficial for providing a day/night cycle and the invisible rays can help your frog metabolize calcium. Some frog owners feel this light is not necessary, but it is not harmful and likely helpful to your frog.</p><p>Just make sure the frog can't jump onto the lamp and make sure your mesh screen lid is secure. Avoid making the enclosure too bright; it may keep your frogs continuously hiding.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>An ideal humidity range for the cage is 50 to 70 percent. If your frog needs more humidity, it can submerge in the water. A hygrometer or humidity gauge will help you check moisture levels. Use a spray bottle to mist the cage with dechlorinated water several times a day, or you can automate this with an electronic mister or fogger that uses sensors or a timer.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the bedding or lining for the bottom of your pet's cage. You can use organic potting soil or a combination of soil and peat moss with reptile bark and sphagnum moss on the terrestrial side to allow the frogs to burrow. The depth of the substrate on the earthy side should be at least 2 to 3 inches to allow burrowing.</p><h2>Terrarium Plants </h2><p>Provide plants and wood pieces for climbing, hiding spots, and basking. When selecting plants for your frog's cage, get plants that thrive in a similar climate: temperature in the 70s F, high humidity, and lower light. Also, make sure your plant selections are not toxic to amphibians. Your best options will be low-lying ferns.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Feed leopard frogs a variety of invertebrates, such as crickets, wax worms, fly larvae, and earthworms. A meal of three to four crickets daily is a good starting point for younger frogs, and experts recommend feeding mature frogs only every other day. Variety seems to be essential with frogs.</p><p>Crickets can make up the bulk of their diet, supplementing them with a variety of other insects, such as roaches, flies, moths, and worms. Prey items should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious foods such as fruits, vegetables, dog food, fish food, or cricket gut loading formula) before being given to the frog. Every other feeding, dust the crickets with a reptile calcium powder.</p><p>Keep an eye on your frog's body shape. Remember that overfeeding is likely more of a problem than underfeeding. Frogs are opportunistic eaters. Make sure that your frog is not getting too round, and if so, cut back on the frequency of feeding.</p><p>The water used in a leopard frog tank must not have chlorine or chloramine, which may be added to municipal tap water. To be safe, use a pet supply product made for removing chlorine and chloramine.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like many captive frogs, pet leopard frogs are susceptible to red leg disease, a parasitic infection that can cause reddening of the legs. Symptoms include sluggishness and a loss of interest in eating or activity.</p><p>Leopard frogs are also prone to fungal infections, which appear as inflammation or a cottony-looking substance on the skin.</p><p>These conditions are treatable but require a visit to an exotics veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing Your Leopard Frog </h2><p>The best places to buy your leopard frog would be a reputable breeder or reptile expo that often features amphibians too. Pet stores do not usually maintain the best husbandry practices, nor do they have a lot of information on the birthdate or health history of your frog. On average, whether you get your from a pet store or breeder, they can cost $10 to $25; this varies on the rarity of the species.</p><p>Look for frogs with clear skin and eyes that aren't cloudy. While these frogs may not be overly active, that's not a cause for concern; they frequently remain still to avoid predators or whenever they're feeling nervous.</p>",1417
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-geckos-1236911,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Leopard Gecko: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Leopard Gecko: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The leopard gecko is a popular beginner's reptile because it's easy to handle and requires minimal care compared to many other lizards. They are native to Afghanistan, Pakistan, northwest India, and Iran. Leopard geckos have perky personalities and make movements that are interesting to watch. They are commonly yellow, white, and spottedwith black dots, and hatchlings are striped and gradually change to the spotted appearance. There are several colorful and patterned morphs or variations.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Leopard gecko</p><p>Adult Size: 8 to 10 inches including tails</p><p>Life Expectancy:20 or more years in captivity</p><h2>Leopard Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Leopard geckos, affectionately called leos, are generally easy to care for. They do not require a lot of cage maintenance, but you should still give their environment a lot of attention.</p><p>Leopard geckos are mostly nocturnal, ground-dwelling geckos that are generally docile and easy to tame. They do not have the sticky toe pads like other geckos, so they do not climb walls. But unlike other geckos, they do have eyelids.</p><p>Leopard geckos are not prone to biting and are usually slow-moving. They are known to be very vocal, especially when they are hungry, and they make chirps and squeaks.</p><p>When you first bring home your leopard gecko, you can socialize it by gently handling it. They will tolerate a certain amount of contact, but don't overdo it or your leopard gecko may become stressed.</p><p>Geckos use their tails to communicate. If you have more than one leopard gecko in an enclosure, keep an eye out for tail-waving. It's a slow, back-and-forth motion. The gecko often raises it, too. This sign means a leopard gecko feels threatened and is about to attack, so separate them right away.</p><p>Leopard geckos also are tail rattlers, similar to rattlesnakes. If you see your gecko rattle the tip of its tail rapidly, that means your leopard gecko is excited to eat or to mate.</p><p>And just like a lot of other lizards, when they feel threatened, leopard geckos can self-amputate their tails as a defense mechanism.</p><h3>6 Ways a Leopard Gecko Can Stand Out from the Crowd</h3><h2>Housing the Leopard Gecko </h2><p>A 10-gallon tank is the minimum size for one leopard gecko, but a larger tank is preferable. Old fish tanks that don't hold water anymore also work perfectly well for leopard geckos. Only keep males and females together if you want to deal with breeding. Like most reptiles, leopard geckos are solitary creatures for the most part, and do not feel lonely or desire the company of other lizards other than when mating.</p><p>Provide half logs as hiding and climbing space. Commercial reptile caves and simple cardboard boxes are also good options. A damp hide box can help with shedding.</p><p>Spot clean the cage once a day to remove feces. About twice a month, take everything out, throw out the substrate, and scrub and disinfect the cage and all the items in it to reduce the buildup of bacteria.</p><p>It's also important to soak your gecko in a shallow pan of lukewarm water for about 10 to fifteen minutes once to twice a week. This will help with hydration and humidity. You might need to complete this process more often if your gecko is shedding.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>You can use a regular white light incandescent heat bulb to provide a basking spot during the day. A red heat bulb, blue, or purple heat bulb, or ceramic heat emitter can provide supplemental heat at night.</p><p>Under-tank heating pads work for heating, but they may not be the most effective for regulating your gecko's temperatures properly. If your gecko burrows down to the glass surface of the tank, an under-tank heating pad might cause burns. Never use hot rocks.</p><p>As cold-blooded creatures, reptiles need to regulate their own body temperature. Reptiles like a range of temperature or thermal gradient, so they can adjust their body warmth. Provide a daytime basking spot of 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) with a thermal gradient down to about 75 Fahrenheit (around 24 Celsius). At night the temperaturecan drop to a range of 70 to 75 Fahrenheit (21 to 24 Celsius). Make sure your gecko is not exposed to any drafts, and do not place the tank next to a window or door.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Being nocturnal, leopard geckosare most active at night and do not require a lot of UV lighting. In the wild, these creatures are also active at dawn and sunset and get UV exposure at those hours of scant sunlight. A small amount of UVA and UVB light (2 percent to 7 percent) can go a long way to keeping leopard geckos healthy and may reduce the risk of metabolic bone disease.</p><p>Your lizard will need incandescent lighting and heat from that source to mimic the sunlight. In the summer, give them about 14 hours of ""sun"" per day. And, in winter, the lizard will need about 12 hours of that light. For ease of care, you can automate the cage lighting by putting the lights on a timer.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>These lizards are desert lizards, so they do not need a highly humid environment. If thehumidity is too low (below 20 percent), the gecko might have trouble shedding. Keep the humidity level about 30 to 40 percent, which is similar to the humidity level in your home. You can use a regular screen top, coupled with the heat source, to keep the environment dry. To check on the humidity level, get a hygrometer or humidity gauge for the cage.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Young leopard geckos shouldn't be kept on a sand substrate, even if it is calcium sand. They may ingest the sand and suffer an intestinal blockage. Paper is absorbent and easy to change, and indoor/outdoor carpet works well, too. Reptile carpet is also a good option; it's easy to clean and your gecko will move around on it well. There is also a low risk that your gecko will ingest this product.</p><p>Avoid wood shavings, since they can cut your gecko's tiny feet. The volatile oils in the wood shavings may be irritating. Whatever substrate you use, make sure your gecko is not ingesting it.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Leopard geckos are insectivores. Feed a variety of crickets, waxworms, and, in moderation, mealworms. On occasion, you can try to feed a pinky mouse to an adult gecko. To make sure that your gecko does not ingest any substrate, you can feed your gecko in an empty tank.</p><p>Juveniles need to be fed several crickets every day. Adults can skip several days between feedings. Before you feed the insects to your pet, they must be gut-loaded or fed a nutritious meal 24 hours before feeding. You will also need to coat the insects with a calcium/vitamin D3 supplement before you feed them to your lizard. To do so, put the crickets or worms in a ziplock bag with some of the powder supplement. Shake the bag quickly and drop the insect into the tank with your lizard. Hatchlings and juveniles need the calcium/vitamin supplement at every feeding; adults only need it at every other feeding.</p><p>You can also provide your gecko with a lick dish of the vitamin.</p><p>Provide a shallow dish of fresh water for your leopard gecko at all times.The water bowl will help add some humidity to the enclosure, and your gecko will drink from the bowl. You may even find a gecko voluntarily soaking in its water bowl.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>One of the most severe conditions that can affect leopard geckos is metabolic bone disease. Just like humans, geckos become ill if they don't get enough calcium and vitamin D. Metabolic bone disease causes painful spine and limb deformities.</p><p>If you notice your gecko developing armpit bubbles, these are not dangerous. They are a sign that your lizard is storing something. These bubbles can contain fat, vitamins, protein, calcium, or other minerals and are common in overweight geckos. Usually, these bubbles go away when the lizard returns to a healthy weight.</p><p>Leopard geckos also are prone to gastroenteritis, which comes from a bacterial infection. If your gecko has watery stoolsor its tail shrinks, these may be signs of gastroenteritis. This condition is potentially fatalbut is treatable if caught early.</p><p>And like other lizards, leopard geckos that are undernourished or live in a cage with insufficient moisture may develop dysecdysis. This condition, which looks like dry skin, causes the gecko to have difficulty shedding and can affect its vision or constrict their fingers or toes.</p><p>Finally, leopard geckos are susceptible to a variety of respiratory infections, including pneumonia. Wheezing or bubbles of mucus around its nasal passages and mouth are a sign that your leopard gecko is having respiratory problems.</p><p>All of these conditions should receive treatment from an exotics veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p><h2>Choosing Your Leopard Gecko </h2><p>Since they are long-lived lizards, be sure you're prepared to care for a leopard gecko for an extended time. These highly popular pets are readily available, but it's always best to purchase geckos from a reputable breeder which can cost $20 to $40. Rare morphs may cost up to $100. You might be able to find a good reptile breeder at a reptile expo or reptile show near you.</p><p>When choosing your pet, look at its tail.It should be plump and fat, preferably as wide or wider than the space between the gecko's shoulders. Its eyes, nose, and mouth should appear clear and not runny. It's vent, or opening for urinating and defecating, should look clean and not swollen.</p><h2>Different Species of Geckos </h2><p>The typical life span of leopard geckos is eight to 15 years, but some live to be as old as 20 if cared for properly.</p><p>Leopard geckos are insectivores, meaning that they only eat insects. Some favorites are mealworms, crickets, waxworms, dubia roaches, and superworms. You should feed your gecko every day or every other day. Your gecko should always have fresh water available.</p><p>Including their tails, geckos grow to be 8 to 10 inches long, making them a fairly small reptile.</p><p>Adult leopard geckos shed every four to eight weeks. Young geckos shed much more frequently, because they are growing rapidly. It typically takes a leopard gecko 24 to 48 hours to finish a complete shed.</p>",1695
52,https://www.thesprucepets.com/care-of-geckos-1238766,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Common House Gecko Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Common House Gecko Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Originally native to southern Europe and northern Africa, common house geckos make interesting pets. Common house geckos have established breeding populations in many warm climates of the world. They are thought to have become an invasive species largely by hitchhiking on ships and other transportation, and then breeding successfully at the destination. Their colors can vary from a yellowish tan with dark spots to a pale grey-white, and they often appear lighter in color at night. These animals are so plentiful and easy to obtain that most animals sold as pets have been ""wild-caught"" right in the home. Because home dwellings are their natural habitat anyway, they adapt very well to life in captivity with an attentive keeper. However, if you want to keep one of these geckos in a colder climate, it will need a warm and humid enclosure. As pets, they are too quick for frequent handling, but their climbing abilities are amazing to watch.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Common house gecko,wall gecko,house lizard, Turkish gecko, Mediterranean gecko, ormoon lizard</p><p>Adult Size: Length of 3 to 5 inches (including the tail)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5+ years in captivity</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Popular Common House Gecko</h3><h2>Common House Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>While common house geckos can live in wild ecosystems,they are commonly found around human habitation, including on the walls and ceilings of houses in tropical climates, which is how they got their name. They are beneficial visitors because they are good at keeping insect populations in check, so many people welcome their cohabitation in their homes. Typically, they eat the insects that are drawn to light sources in and around the home at dusk and dawn.</p><h2>Housing the Common House Gecko </h2><p>Common house geckos have specialized toe pads that allow them to effortlessly move along vertical surfaces, and they can even stick on surfaces upside down; they show very unique behavior for a reptile, as they climb the windows of their tanks with ease.</p><p>A 20-gallon tall terrarium is sufficient for a pair of common house geckos but bigger is better when it comes to their housing. Keep in mind that house geckos always want vertical space for climbing so use a tall tank rather than a long one. House geckos need climbable furnishings in their tall enclosures so provide branches, driftwood, and silk or live plants.</p><p>Males are territorial so keep males one to a cage. Females do get along with others so if you want a group of geckos,make sure you only have one male in your enclosure to avoid fighting. Even when kept alone, these lizards need hiding spots such as reptile caves or small clay plant pots placed on their sides. If you are housing more than one gecko in a cage, be sure to provide enough hides to give all of your lizards options to choose the best space to hide from each other.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>For reasons of both tank cleanliness and air quality, the ground layer of your tank is an important consideration. Give your common house geckos a substrate (floor lining) that retains moisture without being noticeably wet, such as reptile bark or shredded coconut fiber bedding. Sand and washable reptile carpeting are not ideal for these geckos as they do not aid in creating a humid environment. To clean the soiled substrate, simply remove the soiled flooring and replace any divots of ground with material from elsewhere in the tank or fresh bedding.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Common house geckos are from a humid subtropical climate, therefore, do your best to mimic this in their enclosures. Try to maintain a daytime temperature gradient of 75 to 90 F with a nighttime low of 65 to 75 F. Heat can be provided by utilizing ceramic heating elements or reptile bulbs in a reflector fixture. A heat mat may also be useful for supplemental heat, but it will not be very useful in heating the ambient air since it is located under the terrarium. Use whitelight reptile heat bulbsduring daytime hours. At night utilize a red or purple night time bulb for heat.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Common house geckos are nocturnal, so they do not need as much special UVB lighting as day-dwelling reptiles. However, many experts feel that providing UV lighting to mimic sun rays is still beneficial to the overall health of nocturnal animals that sleep during the day; therefore, it is still recommended to use a UVA/UVB light bulb during the daytime.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>House geckos need a moderate to high humidity level in their enclosure so aim for 60 to 75 percent relative humidity which you can measure with a hygrometer. Provide humidity with regular misting, a shallow bowl of water for evaporation, or a fogger; you will find that your geckos mostly drink from water droplets that have collected on the glass and the furnishings from the mist.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>House geckos should be fed a variety of small prey items. Crickets can make up the main part of their diet with the addition of fruit flies and other small flies, silkworms, the occasional mealworm, and other insects. Gut loadthe prey prior to feeding a gecko; dust the prey with a calcium supplement two to three times a week, and a dusting of a multivitamin once a week.</p><p>Feed your common house geckos in the evening. Juveniles should be fed daily but adults can be fed every other day. Feed as much prey as your house gecko will eagerly consume over a 10 minute period. Provide a small shallow water dish with fresh water daily even though common house geckos may prefer to drink from condensed water droplets; your lizard may use this bowl for soaking.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>The common house gecko has adapted to human dwellings in tropical regions where both humidity and insects are ubiquitous in the environment. When these animals become pets In more temperate latitudes, however, they need extra care from their owners to provide for their dietary and environmental needs.</p><p>All geckos can develop a metabolic bone disease (MBD), which is the result of insufficient dietary calcium and vitamin D. Geckos with MBD have a poor appetite, exhibit tremors, and sometimes, they can even develop painful limb deformities.</p><p>These geckos also get respiratory infections, including pneumonia. If your gecko is drooling or wheezing or has excess mucus around its nasal passages, these symptoms likely indicate a respiratory infection.</p><p>Seek out an exotic animalveterinarian who specializes in reptiles and especially lizards. Most geckos will recover from these maladies if they are treated in the early stages.</p><h2>Choosing Your Common House Gecko </h2><p>Owners of pet common house geckos should be careful not to contribute to the invasive species problem by releasing them into the wild in foreign zones. But if you catch a house gecko in North America to keep as a pet, you won't be doing harm to the species overall. Due to climate change, their range is increasing northward, and the reach of this urbanized species that lives symbiotically with humans is predicted to spread on many additional continents beyond their native southern Europe and northern Africa.</p><p>Before you acquire a common house gecko, inspect its skin for any sign of dry patches, which could indicate problems shedding. If possible, arrange to watch the animal eat to ensure it has a healthy appetite before taking it on as your pet.</p>",1282

This lizard commonly known as the black-throated monitor lizardis a large reptile with a surprisingly mild temperament when kept as a pet. As with its cousins, the white-throated monitor and thesavannah monitor, their temperaments in the wild might be ornery, but they are often relatively gentle in captivity when they receive proper care. This lizard should only be kept by an advanced reptile keeper as these monitors require an extremely large enclosure; they can grow to be over 60 pounds!</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black throat monitors, black-throated monitors, Ionides monitors,cape monitors</p><p>Scientific Names:,,</p><p>Adult Size: Upto 7 feet long and more than 60 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 years or more</p><h2>Black-Throated Monitor Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Black-throated monitors are semi-arboreal, meaning that in the wild they live mostly up in the trees, especially as juveniles. Adults don't climb as much as the juveniles, but they are still able to lumber up a branch whenever they need to escape dangers on the ground or to forage in a tree for food.</p><p>These diurnal (day dwelling) lizards also like to spend a good amount of time burrowing or hiding under rocks, but black-throated monitors are also playful creatures that need stimulation; otherwise, they get bored and restless and may lash out as a result.</p><p>Most small lizards, such as geckos and chameleons, generally prefer not to be handled by humans. But the larger lizards of the monitor family actually need interaction in order to habituate them to their owners. Some studies suggest that these lizards are intelligent enough to recognize their human keepers.</p><p>If not handled regularly by humans, black-throated monitors in captivity may become aggressive. When they feel threatened or stressed, these large animals will puff up their bodies and hiss; they have even been known to bite. Given the animal's size, a bite from one can do some serious damage. If you see your monitor lizard starting to puff up, back away and leave the animal alone until it shows signs of calming down.</p><p>Stress is very bad for reptiles, as it can lead to a weakened immune system and a host of subsequent health problems. As with all pets, exercise is a good stress reliever. In warm weather, black-throated monitors can be walked outside just like dogs (albeit a bit slower) using a harness and leash. This is great for your monitor in many ways; socialization, UVB rays, and exercise are all good for its overall health.</p><h2>Housing the Black-Throated Monitor </h2><p>A black-throated monitor lizard requires a large and strong enclosure. Most owners end up building a permanent enclosure for their black throats out of wood or plexiglass. The enclosure must be large enough for your monitor to walk forward a few steps, turn around, and generally stretch out.</p><p>Provide your heavy reptile with a variety of places to both climb on and bask. Shelves at various heights and sturdy branches for climbing provide your pet with areas to explore and places to bask up near ceiling heat lamps. Add additional ramps and secondary ways to climb up and down.</p><p>A hard plastic kiddie pool or utility tub with ramps added for easy access and exit will be appreciated by your lizard even though monitors are not strong swimmers. Get a tub with a drain for easy cleaning since the water usually needs to be changed daily. You will also need a protected heater for the water to keep the temperature around 80 F.</p><p>Even big monitors need a place where they can feel safe and secure so a hiding area should be provided. Use plywood to build an inverted wooden box to serve as a hiding area. Make sure that all furnishings in the cage are bolted securely in place.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Monitors lizards are also diggers, so they need to have an earthen floor (the substrate). Add a deep layer of substrate material to the enclosure; clean dirt mixed with sand is sufficient. Vinyl or tile flooring can be used under the substrate as well, since it is easily cleaned. But digging claws may damage this layer of material.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Since these lizards hail from Africa, they like hot temperatures. Tanzania has a tropical climate where it stays over 68 F year-round (except at the higher elevations). Provide your monitor lizard with a basking area that reaches into the upper 90-degree range during the day while staying above 75 F at night.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Monitor lizards need a source of UVB lighting for roughly 12 hours per day to remain healthy. Sunlight is the best source of UVB, but it is not always available. Sunlight through windows is also not a source of UVB as the glass filters out these invisible rays.</p><p>Like other monitor lizards, black throats require the addition of UVB ray support. Reptile heat lamps and special UVB emitting bulbs can be used to provide your pet with appropriate temperatures and a day/night cycle that includes the rays that the sun emits. If you've decided to house your black-throated monitor outside year-round and it gets natural sunlight, then artificial UVB lighting is not necessary.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>In the wilds of Tanzania, black-throated monitorsare obligate carnivores, which are true carnivores that cannot digest plant matter. They eat small reptiles, birds and eggs, rodents, aquatic animals, and insects.In captivity as well, they need to eat many whole prey items such as mice and birds. Rats,and other rodents along with young chickens are generally good options for meals. Crustaceans, fish, eggs, snakes, lizards, and even freshwater shellfish are also all fair game and offer good variations to the diet.</p><p>Insects, such as crickets, mealworms, and cockroachescan be fed to monitors in addition to their regular meals of rodents and birds. If you do feed insects, dust them with a calcium powder first, and make sure the insect has been gut-loaded.</p><p>While their wild-caught counterparts may only want to eat live prey, captive-bred monitors are willing to eat previously-killed prey. Most monitor owners buy previously-killed, frozen mice in bulk online and thaw them as needed. There is some debate as to whether these lizards need to stalk or hunt before eating, but if they've been raised in captivity it's likely that this primal instinct has been suppressed.</p><p>Feed your monitor a few times a week and adjust the meal schedule if your pet becomes too thin or overweight. Weigh your monitor monthly so that you can adjust feedings as needed.</p><p>Use sturdy bowls for food and drinking water. Using bowls that can be firmly attached to the side of the cage is the best way to prevent spillage. Even if your monitor has a pool for wading, a freshened water bowl should still be provided.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>If your black-throated lizard seems lethargic or otherwise unwell, don't try to treat these symptoms yourself. Seek treatment from an exotic animal veterinarian who specializes in lizards.</p><p>Like other monitor lizards and many other pet reptiles, black-throatedlizards are susceptible to metabolic bone disease, which is the result of acalcium-phosphorousimbalance that usually occurs when the lizard isn't getting enough UVB lighting to make Vitamin D.</p><p>A significant health concern to watch out for with any large lizard is constipation due to impaction. Like other big lizards, black-throatedmonitors have voracious appetites, and often that means they eat things they cannot easily digest, like the sand or substrate from their cages.</p><p>Although they are known to get parasitic infections, black-throated lizards don't get them as often as the smaller lizard species. The presence of parasites often indicates inadequate husbandry conditions that can be rectified with adjustments in housing, but safe medical treatment by a veterinarian might be required.</p><h2>Choosing Your Black-Throated Monitor </h2><p>These are large, strong reptiles that can be challenging pets for this reason. Be sure you have the resources available to house and feed such a big animal. It's also important to check the local laws regarding owning any exotic species where you live.</p><p>As with most exotic pets, it's best to obtain them from a reputable breeder who will tell you its health history. Clear eyes, smooth skin, and general alertness are all signs of a healthy black-throated monitor lizard. If it appears lethargic or doesn't take food readily when offered, it may be ill.</p>",1397
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/frill-necked-lizards-1239179,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Frill Necked Lizards (Frilled Dragons): Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Frill Necked Lizards (Frilled Dragons): Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Frill-necked lizards are native to Australia and New Guinea. They are amazing bipedal reptiles with a spectacular frill around their neck that may remind you of a prehistoric dilophosaurus (the original ""Jurassic Park"" movie made them quite popular). They are not a commonly kept pet reptile since they are rare to find, but they are fascinating creatures. These lizards are excellent for both experienced and novice lizard owners, due to their calm nature and relatively simple feeding needs. They're not the longest-lived reptiles; what they may lack in years, they make up for in personality.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Frill-neckedlizards frilled lizards, frilled dragons</p><p>Adult Size: 2 to 3 feet, males are generally bigger than females</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years in captivity</p><h2>Frill-Necked Lizard Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Frill-neckedlizards are docile, low-key critters. When feeling threatened, they stand up on their hind legs, frill out their neck, open their mouth, and spit, exposing their tiny little teeth. They run on their hind legs to escape a predator in the wild. If provoked, captive frill-necked lizards may nip or bite your hand. Some pet frillies may whip their tails at you, too, but this is rare.</p><p>A frill-necked lizard with its frill fully open and on display looks impressive, but it generally indicates the animal is very stressed, sensing imminent danger. If your lizard does this regularly, it may be a sign of a more significant health issue.</p><p>They do not particularly like handling, but if hand-raised from when it was a hatchling, it may tolerate it.</p><p>You can house multiple frilled-neck lizards together; however, two males will fight for territory. As for a male and female pair, they may breed. And if they do, expect many babies. Also, if you accommodate two from the start, you will need to double the enclosure size.</p><p>If you plan to breed yourfrill-neckedlizards, November through February are the ideal months for laying clutches of eggs. Up to 25 soft-shelled eggs are usual in a clutch, and sometimes you can get two clutches per season. The eggs must remain in the soil at least 2 inches deep and kept at a minimum of 86 F for two to three months until they hatch.</p><h2>Housing the Frill-Necked Lizard </h2><p>Frilled-neck lizards are arboreal lizards, meaning these unique lizards are most comfortable clinging to tree trunks. They usually only venture out of the trees to eat, fight, or flee. Provide branches for climbing and some foliage for your lizard to hide among the leaves.</p><p>House this lizard in at least a 55-gallon large tank, which gives it some space for exercise. Screened enclosures allow for more climbing opportunities but do not hold in humidity as well as a glass tank.</p><p>Once you set up the enclosure, you can automate the lights on a timer to make things easier. The rest of the lizard's care needs are straightforward: Feed and change its water daily, and deep clean the lizard's entire enclosure once a month. Between deep cleanings, you will need to spot clean or scoop up visible feces.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Frilled lizards are cold-blooded; they need to regulate their internal body temperature and do so by moving around in their cage to cool down or get warm. Provide a thermal gradient or range of temperatures in the cage.</p><p>These lizards need a gradient of 85 to 115 F during the day. Most of the enclosure should be around 90 to 100 F and at least one hot area reaching 115 F.At night, the temperatures should not drop lower than 75 to 80 F. You can use incandescent lights, UVB lights, under-tank heating pads, and ceramic heat emitters to bring the enclosure up to temperature.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Reptiles synthesize vitamin D3 through UVB light or fluorescent ultraviolet rays usually provided by the sun. In turn, vitamin D3 is essential for the absorption of calcium from their food. Provide a UVB (10.0), which emits 10 percent UVB, a higher-strength output sufficient for this species. A mercury vapor bulb is a lamp that does triple duty; it provides UVB, lights up the enclosure, and provides heat. Other bulbs, such as incandescent lighting or nocturnal reptile bulbs (invisible to reptiles), illuminate as well as provide heat.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Frilled-necked lizards need an environment with 55 to 65 percent humidity. To add moisture, you can spray or mist the cage several times a day. A hygrometer or humidity gauge will help you check moisture levels. You might notice the lizard use its water bowl for bathing; this is usually to cool down or to help loosen it's shedding skin.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the bedding or lining for the bottom of your pet's cage. Babies can be kept on newspaper or paper towels.For adults, use a substrate that holds humidity and can somewhat cushion any falls.Good substrate options include coconut fiber, cypress mulch, organic potting soil, and sphagnum moss. You can also use reptile carpet, but it does not hold humidity well.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Frill-necked lizards are omnivorous and will eat a variety of foods. They are diurnal animals, so feed them in the morning. You will mostly feed them crickets and superworms, which are readily available through pet suppliers. Gut-load (feed them nutritious meals before being fed to your pet) and dust them with a calcium and multivitamin supplement every other day.</p><p>An adult frilled dragon can eat 20 crickets a day or 20 superworms or a combination of the two.These lizards are not overeaters and can moderate their food intake.It is best to let them have access to as much food as they want; they will stop when they have had enough.</p><p>Frill-necked lizards will also eat butterworms, silkworms, dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes, carrots, split peas, and green beans. As treats, you can offer waxworms, mealworms, mice, and fruitsparingly.</p><p>Providing enrichment during feeding time is not only entertaining to watch, but it is also mentally stimulating for your lizard. Try attaching an empty toilet paper roll to a branch and allow your lizard to catch some insects inside the roll.</p><p>Include a large-sizedwater bowlin the lizard's enclosure and fill it with fresh filtered water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Most frill-necked lizard illnesses stem from improper care. These lizards need daily exposure to ultraviolet light to avoid vitamin D deficiency and calcium malabsorption. Inadequate UVB can lead to metabolic bone disease, which manifests as soft, weak limbs and jaw, bad posture (lying flat against the ground), refusal to feed, and lethargy.</p><p>They also need appropriate heat and humidity to prevent respiratory infections. Signs of a respiratory infection include wheezing, breathing with the mouth open, and mucus around the nasal passages and mouth.</p><p>If your lizard is not accepting food, even just once, it's usually a sign of a digestive problem such as a parasite. And if you notice your frill-necked lizard has difficulty shedding, this may be a sign of a skin infection, usually fungal.</p><p>Ideally, find an exotics veterinarian who specializes in lizards to observe any changes in your pet's behavior or appearance that you might overlook.</p><h2>Choosing a Frill-Necked Lizard </h2><p>These lizards are somewhat rare among reptile owners, but several reputable breeders offer frill-necked lizards. To find a reputable breeder, ask other local reptile owners or an exotics veterinarian near you or attend a reptile expo, which has many reptiles for sale by breeders.</p><p>While they come in a variety of colors, there is only one documented species of frilled-necked lizards. The body of the lizard is darker than the frill, which is often a yellow or orange color. You can expect to pay between $150 to $300.</p><p>Make sure your lizard looks in good health before buying it. It should have clear nostrils; the mouth should appear pink (not red or cheesy discharge); and the fecal opening (vent) should be clean. Take your new lizard to an exotics veterinarian for a thorough exam, including a stool check, to ensure that it doesn't have any internal parasites or other ailments.</p>",1327

They are not overly active creatures and usually tolerate handling. Savannahs are popular pets in the United Statesbut don't always thrive in captivity. This lizard is not a pet for an amateur reptile lover; they have stringent care requirements to keep them healthy. This lizard hails from the savannah or grasslands of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Names: Savannah monitor,Bosc monitor</p><p>Adult Size:3 to 4 feet long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years average; some may live up to 15 years</p><h2>Savannah Monitor Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Savannah monitors spend most of their time basking in the sun, burrowing in the soil, and eating a variety of small prey food such as rodents, smaller lizards, and insects.</p><p>Regular handling from an early age makes it a tame, docile creature. But like all monitors, if it is not a captive-bred baby or handled often, the savannah monitor can become aggressive and can bite. Their teeth are small but sharp; their claws can also scratch; and it also uses its long, heavy tail as a whip to defend itself.</p><p>This lizard requires a large cage setup and strict environmental control; its care is comprehensive and not recommended for beginners.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Popular Savannah Monitor</h3><h2>Housing the Savannah Monitor </h2><p>Savannahs are strong and known for beingescape artists. Make sure the cage is entirely enclosed and has a secure lock. A hatchling or juvenile savannah will live comfortably in a 55-gallon aquarium for about six months, but they grow quickly. Most owners have their adult setup ready when they bring home a baby. Its enclosure will need to be at least twice its length at adulthood. An adult lizard requires an 8-feet long by a 4-feet wide cage. It should be at least 3 feet high.</p><p>The height of the enclosure should prevent them from escaping and allow a branch or other decoration in the cage on the off chance they want to climb. Monitors can be destructive, so only provide rocks and hides; decorations aren't necessary. Their claws will shred screen-sided enclosures, so a glass or Plexiglas siding is best. Plan for a place to hang lights and heat sources above the cage.</p><p>Make room for a large water dish (you can also use a cat litter box) that will allow the monitor to submerge its entire body.</p><p>Feces should be spotcleanedevery day from theirenclosure, especially if it is in their water. Thoroughly clean the entire cage every two weeks and find a safe place to hold your lizard while doing so. Some owners use a hard plastic pet carrier or the bathtub.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Provide an average enclosure temperature of 95 F to 100 F and a basking spot between 110 F and 130 F. As cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature. The cage needs a temperature gradient down to 85 F in the day and as low as 75 F at night.Use ceramic heat emitters instead of lights for achieving nighttime temperature requirements.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>UVB lighting is necessary for most lizards, including monitors. A high-percentage UVB output bulb (8 to 10 percent) should be on for a 10- to 12-hour cycle daily to mimic the sun's output. Change the bulbs every six months,even if the light doesn't burn out. The invisible UVB rays stop emitting after that period.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Being native to Africa, savannah monitors were historically kept in dry, hot environments in captivity, which mimicked their natural habitats. More recently, though, monitor owners see better results by providing more humidity and areas to burrow.</p><p>A hygrometer inside the cage should monitor humidity in the enclosure accurately. Provide a gradient in the substrate of almost 100 percent humidity and try to keep it above 60 percentin the coolest part of the cage. The basking area will likely be a moisture-free zone.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Reptile owners sometimes use substrate or bedding to line the bottom of a cage. Savannah monitors are diggers and will appreciate substrate for burrowing.</p><p>Savannahs are voracious eaters and may gobble up substrate with their prey item. Choose bedding that will not cause impaction or clog the digestive tract. Small substrate like calciumsand is semi-digestible in tiny amounts.</p><p>Paper towels, butcher paper, towels,reptile-safe carpet, felt, and other easily cleaned and changed, flat bedding options are best for messy or more aggressive lizards. If your monitor is on the tame side, try natural bedding like sand, organic soil, or a mixture of both that they can burrow down at least 24-inches deep. The used or soiled substrate will need to be changed regularlyat least every two weeks.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Savannah monitors are carnivores and opportunistic eaters that are prone to obesity. Monitor their weight to pre vent excess weight gain. Feed juveniles three times a week, but adult savannahs may only need feeding once a week. You can also feed them at regular time to get your lizard used to a routine, if you want.</p><p>The amount you feed depends on the size of your lizard. On average, juveniles (up to 3 feet long) should eat about one to four fuzzy mice or one small mouse, supplemented with a few insects. Adults (larger than 3 feet long) should eat two to three adult mice per week or one rat, supplemented with some insects.</p><p>Feed savannahs gut-loaded insects, such as crickets, roaches, and earthworms. Gut-loading involves feeding nutritious food to prey items, so those nutrients pass on to the lizard.</p><p>Dust calcium powder onto insects and young rodents that don't have good bone density. A low-fat, high-quality (grain-free) canned dog or monitor foodshould be fed only occasionally, as too much protein can cause gout.</p><p>If you worry about impaction from the lizard eating its substrate with the prey item, don't feed your savannah in its cage. Get a separate, plain-bottomed tank for feeding time; it will also help keep its enclosure clean. Never hand feed this animal, it may mistake your fingers for food; you do not want your lizard to associate your hand with a tasty treat.</p><p>Change and clean its water container daily and replenish it with filtered water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Common savannah monitor illnesses are treatable by an exotics veterinarian. These lizards are prone to parasitic infections, symptoms of which include sluggishness, lack of appetite, and vomiting. They can also get external parasites or mites that suck the lizard's blood through the skin. Both of these conditions are potentially life-threatening and common in savannah lizards kept in captivity.</p><p>Like many reptiles, savannah monitors are also susceptible to respiratory infections. Open-mouthed breathing, wheezing,andmucus in the mouth are the most common symptoms.</p><p>These lizards can also acquire metabolic bone disease if they do not get adequate UVB rays and calcium and vitamin D supplementation.</p><h2>Choosing Your Savannah Monitor </h2><p>When buying your savannah monitor, look for one that has been ""ranched,"" meaning it was bred in a native but controlled environment, or get one from a reputable breeder. Attend local reptile shows or expos to meet breeders and shop for lizards and supplies while there. They can cost from $25 to $100.</p><p>If you have a lot of experience with reptiles, inquire at reptile rescues or adoption centers for savannah monitors. Many inexperienced pet owners will surrender their animals once they grow to adult size and become harder to manage and care for. Keep in mind that many of these pets may not be hand-tamed, are stressed, and need rehabilitation from neglect.</p><p>Signs of a healthy monitor include smooth, even skin; no traces of mites (small, reddish-brown spots around the face); clear, bright eyes; rounded, full body; and a strong, even, smooth jawline.</p>",1319
56,https://www.thesprucepets.com/green-anoles-pets-1236900,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>Green Anole: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Green Anole: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The green anole is relatively small, inexpensive, and easy to care for, but they need to be handled gingerly or not at all. These little lizards are common pets and make a good reptile for first time reptile keepers. They are native to the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. It is fairly easy to meet their housing and dietary requirements, although some specialized equipment is required to set up a proper vivarium for anoles as they are quite active little animals. Although anoles are relatively easy to care for, this does not necessarily make them a low-maintenance pet; maintaining their terrarium or enclosure requires careful and frequent attention.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Green anole, Carolina anole, American anole, American chameleon, and red-throated anole</p><p>Adult Size: Males are about eight inches long (including the tail) in captivity. Females are a bit smaller.</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 to 8 years</p><h2>Green Anole Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Anoles can be kept alone or in small groups. Males are territorial and may display and fight with one another, so a group is best composed of females with no more than one male. They are pleasant enough pets, but their natural instinct is to protect their territory. Males will try to show dominance by extending their dewlaps to appear larger to prospective mates. If it opens and closes its dewlap, this is a sign of aggression and signals that the animal is feeling unsafe or threatened.</p><p>These lizards are sometimes calledAmerican chameleons, although they are not true chameleons at all. Anoles can change their color from brown to bright emerald green, and they are attractive little lizards. Males have a pink or red dewlap (the fold of skin under the chin/neck), which they flash during territorial and courtship displays. Females of some species also have dewlaps, although they are generally smaller and not displayed as often.</p><p>Green anoles are skittish and shy, but with consistent and gentle handling, they will become somewhat tame. Anoles are active little lizards that scamper about quickly, making them hard to catch. They prefer not to be handled too much; avoid it if at all possible, and always handle them gently.</p><p>Never dangle green anoles by the tail, as anoles can detach and drop their long tailas a defense against predators in the wild. When an anole drops its tail, it will usually regenerate, but will not look the same as it did originally.</p><h2>Housing the Green Anole </h2><p>An appropriately-sized aquarium with a tight-fitting screen top makes the best home; an absolute minimum tank size would be a 10-gallon aquarium for one or two anoles, but larger is better and necessary for groups of three or more.</p><p>These lizards are mainly diurnal (active during the daytime) and while they like to bask in the sun, they prefer to do so among plants. The pads on the bottoms of their feet allow them to climb and cling to most surfaces, including glass, and they will escape enclosures that are not secure. The preferred substrates include soil (without perlite), peat moss, or orchid bark.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Use a hygrometer inside the enclosure to measure the relative humidity; as hygrometer readings can change with age, they can also be calibrated once annually. Maintain the humidity for this anole enclosure at 70 percent by misting daily with dechlorinated or bottled (not distilled) water. A dish of the same water should also be provided.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Essentially, a semi-tropical environment should be created (not a rain forest) with daytime temperatures of 75 to 82 F for 12 to 14 hours per day. The temperature should not fall below 65 F at night. During the day, a basking area with a basking light should cover only 25 percent of the surface of the enclosure; aim for a basking temperature of 85 to 90 F during the daytime. Do not use hotrocks as heat sources as they can burn your pet and also end up over-heating the entire enclosure.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>A variety of lights are needed, some for heat, some for white light, and some for UVB light. Green anoles generally need 12 to 14 hours of light and 10 to 12 hours of darkness. Turn off all light sources at night.</p><p>No artificial light is as good as sunlight for providing UVB, so when the outside temperature on a sunny day is over 70 F, place your anole outside in a secure screen or wire cage with a locking door. Provide some shade and a hiding place within the sunny day enclosure.</p><p>If an anole does not have access to bright sunlight, ZooMed's reptile or iguana lights, and Durotest's Vita-Lite are two good options; these UVB light sources should be replaced every six months. Glass cages, even those with a screen top, should never be used near a window as they will trap heat and can cause fatally high temperatures.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Anoles usually get 100 percent of their water intake by licking droplets off of leaves of plants, so provide several plants in the enclosure; branches for basking are also essential. Generally, anoles will not lap water from a dish unless it is equipped with a constant slow drip, so their terrarium plants should be misted twice daily.</p><p>Green anoles do best on a variety of gut-loaded insects including mealworms and wax worms.Feed two to three appropriately sizedprey items, about half the size of the anole's head, every other day. A calcium and vitamin supplement should also be dusted on the insects. Be careful in allowing your anole to catch wild insects; there's no way to know what kinds of pesticides wild-caught insects may be harboring.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Like many reptiles, green anoles are susceptible to an ailment called mouth rot or stomatitis. If you notice puffiness or redness around its mouth or a substance that looks like cottage cheese around its teeth, it's likely mouth rot.</p><p>Do not try to treat this aggressive infection with a home remedy. This condition requires treatment by a veterinarian who has expertise in treating reptiles. This painful condition can lead to tooth loss and eventually infect the lizard's jaw. For this reason, mouth rot can be fatal if left untreated.</p><p>Metabolic bone disease, which comes from a poor diet or lack of UVB exposure, shows symptoms of weight loss, puffy face, and general weakness and lethargy. Rectifying the diet and exposing your anole to an adequate amount of UVB rays should help.</p><p>Other lizards are prone to respiratory infections; these are relatively uncommon in green anoles, however, they do occur. If your anole is wheezing or holding its mouth open, these are signs of a respiratory infection, usually resulting from insufficient humidity or an insufficient heat gradient in its enclosure.</p><p>If your anole is not turning green and appears to be a dull brown color, this may be a sign it is stressed or that it has an underlying health issue. Consult with your veterinarian before trying to treat your anole at home.</p><p>Remember that all reptiles are common carriers of Salmonella bacteria, so proper hygiene is necessary when handling them and cleaning their equipment, especially if children or people with weakened immune systems live in the same house.</p><h2>Choosing Your Green Anole </h2><p>Most anoles available in pet stores are wild-caught. Sometimes, pet store anoles will be dehydrated and emaciated when purchased, as evidenced by loose folds of skin. If a captive-bred lizard can be acquired, this is preferable, as they tend to be less stressed and not as prone to illness or disease.</p><p>Avoid anoles that look ill or dehydrated. Any anoles that are new to you and intended for your group should be housed separately and checked by a veterinarian for internal and external parasites while still quarantined.</p>",1309

These snakes are magnificent animals with beautiful brown and black markings. They make fascinating pets for the right owner. However, they are not suitable for beginners and are generally best left in the wild. They are massive snakes, both expensive to keep and potentially dangerous.Owners have died due to handling mistakes with these snakes. It's not easy to find someone to take a giant snake if you can no longer care for it, and Burmese pythons are relatively long-lived.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Burmese python</p><p>Adult Size: 15 to 20 feet long, up to 200 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: Usually about 25 years</p><h2>Burmese Python Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Burmese pythons are one of the five largest snakes in the world. Compared to other giant snakes, they are generally considered docile. Hatchlings can be skittish but are usually readily hand-tamed.</p><p>Handle these snakes frequently from a young age, or else they will be challenging to hold as they get larger. Touch the snake gently but firmly and be persistent if it resists at first. Avoid handling your snake for a couple of days after feeding, or it may regurgitate.</p><p>These semiaquatic snakes are aggressive feeders. If you only handle your snake or open its enclosure at meals, your snake may associate you with food. Decondition this association by frequently holding the snake. If it strikes at you, or worse, tries to wrap itself around you, it can inflict serious injury. Always have a second person present when handling or feeding pythons longer than 8 feet. It doesn't take long for a full-grown Burmese python to overpower a person. If your python begins to wrap itself around you, immediately unwind it starting at the tail.</p><p>These pets require a lot of care and maintenance including regular cage cleaning, daily water container changes, and two people to provide food at mealtimes when they reach adult size.</p><h2>Housing the Burmese Python </h2><p>A 55-gallon tank works for a younger snake, but as the snake grows, you will need a more extensive and stronger enclosure. After the first couple of years, options include custom built wood and Plexiglass cages or modifying a large closet or room for your snake. These snakes are excellent escape artists and are very strong, so housing for these snakes must be substantialat least 8 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet tall, strong, and very secure.</p><p>For young snakes, a half log or other hide soldat the pet storewill workeven a cardboard box will sufficebut as they grow, you will have to be more creative. Plastic storage bins make good hides for larger snakes, simply cut an access hole in one side and making sure there are no sharp edges.</p><p>Your snake will need a sizable, sturdy water container. For young snakes, a heavy dog water bowl will suffice. Adults will need a plastic storage container, kitty litter box, or infant bathtub. Plastic containers are light and can tip over, so use massive rocks at the bottom to weigh them down.</p><p>You will need to spot clean the bedding or floor of the cage whenever they defecate. Clean the entire cage once a month. Change the water and clean out the container daily. Disinfect the enclosure with a water and vinegar solution and change out the bedding.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Reptiles are cold-blooded creatures that need to self-regulate their body temperature by moving between warmer and cooler spots in their habitat. Native to the rainforest, Burmese pythons need a daytime temperature of 85 to 88 F with a basking area at 90 to 93 F. The temperature can drop to 78 to 80 F at night. Use spotlights, ceramic heat elements, and heating pads to maintain temperatures, but shield or engage the lights to prevent burns. For large snakes, a pig heating blanket is a good option for maintaining temperature.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>These snakes need a 10- to 12-hour cycle of light (10 hours in winter, 12 in summer). If lighting is sufficient from the sunlight streaming in through your windows, that should suffice. If not, switch on an incandescent lamp for 10 to 12 hours and account for the heat it adds to the enclosure. You can automate lights on a timer. Most nocturnal animals or animals that live beneath the rainforest canopy do not need ultraviolet light, although it cannot hurt to use a UVB (5.0) fluorescent light in the enclosure to provide vitamin D3, which aids in calcium absorption.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Maintain a 50 to 60 percent humidity level in the enclosure. To add moisture, you can spray or mist the cage several times a day. A hygrometer or humidity gauge will help you check moisture levels. As long as there is a water bowl large enough for the snake to submerge completely, the humidity should be adequate. If you notice that your snake is about to shed, you can provide a humidity retreat by placing damp sphagnum moss in a plastic container with a lid and cut a hole large enough for the snake to climb in and out.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the bedding or lining for the bottom of your pet's cage. For hatchlings, use paper towels or unprinted paper to line the enclosure. For bigger snakes, indoor/outdoor carpeting is easier to maintain; keep a few pieces on hand and switch them out when it is time to clean and disinfect. You can also cut linoleum sheets to size; they are easy to clean and disinfect.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Burmese pythons are usually good eaters. Hatchlings can be fed one to two times per week with mice or fuzzy rats. As the snake grows, you will gradually increase the prey size to rats and eventually, rabbits.The prey should be no larger than the width of the snake.</p><p>Adult snakes only need to be fed every two weeks or so. Feed often enough to maintain optimum body condition; you should not be able to see the snake's ribs. It's essential to be careful not to overfeed them, or you will end up with an obese snake. Signs your snake may be overweight include noticeable scale separation, sunken spine, or ""fat wrinkles."" If your snake goes on an eating strike, it is not necessarily an illness; some snakes do not eat during seasonal changes, before shedding, or if their cage is not warm enough.</p><p>Younger snakes can be fed in their cage as long as they do not have a loose substrate at the floor of the enclosure that they might swallow along with the food item.</p><p>A dish of water should always be available for both drinking and soaking. It should be changed daily or immediately if the water gets soiled.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>One of the most severe ailments to afflict the python and boa family of snakes is inclusion body disease. This fatal virus can spread from one snake to another, and its symptoms include abnormal shedding, anorexia, constipation, tremors, and loss of motor control. Many snakes with this disease starve to death because they can't digest any new food, even if force-fed.</p><p>Like other reptiles, Burmese pythons are susceptible to respiratory infections and mouth rot, or stomatitis. A snake with a respiratory infection will breathe with its mouth open or wheeze. Mouth rot will show as a reddish discoloration around and in the animal's mouth.</p><p>It's essential to have an exotics veterinarian who specializes in reptiles check your Burmese python annually for any signs of disease; many don't show symptoms until the animal has been suffering for some time.</p><h2>Choosing Your Pet </h2><p>The most important consideration when choosing a Burmese python is whether or not you have the time, space, and patience to care for it. Many owners become overwhelmed, resulting in captive-bred pythons being released into the wildthis is illegal.</p><p>The best way to get a Burmese python is through a reputable breeder who can tell you of any health issues the snake may have. You can potentially find a reputable breeder through an exotics vet, a referral from another local snake owner, or a regional reptile expo.</p><p>You can expect to pay $300 for hatchlings or juveniles and up to $20,000 for rare, uniquely patterned adults (morphs) or proven breeders.</p><p>A healthy Burmese python hatchling will have its unique coloring as soon as it comes out of the shell. Babies have the distinctive Burmese look, so do not believe anyone who tells you otherwise. If a snake appears lethargic, has redness around the mouth, or keeps their mouth agape, these are signs of potential illness.</p>",1447
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/boa-constrictors-as-pets-1237315,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Boa Constrictor: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Boa Constrictor: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>There are several varieties of boa constrictors found in the pet trade, including red-tail boas () and northern boas (). These snakes are native to parts of North, Central, and South America. Their care is fairly similar, and they tend to do well in captivity. While boas are generally quite docile in temperament, it is important to respect their inherent strength. Just as they constrict around their prey, they can wrap themselves tightlyand painfullyaround you. However, with regular handling most boas learn to be comfortable around people. In fact, they can become quite tame and calm pets.And they are fairly low-maintenance snakes that don't need much in terms of daily care once you get their housing and feeding routine down.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Boa constrictor</p><p>Scientific Names: ,</p><p>Adult Size: 8to 10 feet long</p><p>Life Expectancy:20 to 30years on average</p><h2>Boa Constrictor Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Boas are typically active, alert snakes. They might hiss or bite if they feel threatened, but consistent handling usually will make them tame and not so defensive. It's important to know how to hold a boa, so it feels secure. One hand should be under its body near its head, and the other hand should be under the back half of its body. The boa might loosely wrap itself around you for added support, but it typically won't constrict unless it feels alarmed or like it's falling.</p><h2>Housing the Boa Constrictor </h2><p>While baby boa constrictors can be housed in glass aquariums, larger snakes will need a customenclosure that's either commercially purchased or constructed at home. Boa constrictors are very powerful and will escape if given the chance, so enclosures must be secure. A good enclosure size for an adult boa constrictor is around 6 to 8 feet long, 2 to 3 feet wide, and 2 to3 feet tall. The minimum size is around 10 square feet of floor space for a single snake.</p><p>Hide boxes are essential to make your snakefeel secure. A minimum of two hides should be provided in the enclosure, one at each end ofthe temperaturegradient. Hides can be half logs, commercial reptile caves, upside-down plastic containers with a hole cut in the side, or even cardboard boxes. Make sure they are not much larger than the snake, as a close fit will help the snake feel safe. They should be cleaned or replaced when they become soiled.</p><p>A cleaned and sterilized tree branch that's heavy enough to support the snake's weight should also be provided in the enclosure. Soak it in a bleach solution, rinse it very well, and dry it thoroughly before adding it if you got it from outside. Store-boughtdriftwood can also be used.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Boa constrictors come from tropical climates, so warm temperatures in their enclosures are essential. During the day, a temperature gradient between 82 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (28 to 32 degrees Celsius) should be maintained. Also, a basking spot of 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (32 to 35 degrees Celsius) should be provided. At night, temperatures can drop to 78 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (26 to 30 degrees Celsius).</p><p>The temperatures in your snake's cage are critical, so accurate thermometers with measurements in several locations of the enclosure (the warm end, cool end, and basking spot) are a must. A combination of incandescent bulbs, ceramic heating elements, and heating pads can be used to maintain the temperatures. Any bulbs or heating elements in the enclosure must be shielded to prevent burns, to which snakes are quite susceptible. Hot rocks should never be used.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Boas generally do not need any special UV lighting. Their diet should provide them with the vitamin D that they would produce from the sun's UV rays in the wild.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Maintain a humidity level in the enclosure of around 60 to 70 percent. Keeping a bowl of water in the enclosure can help to raise the humidity level, along with misting the area. The snake will likely climb into the water bowl for baths, so make sure it's sturdy and big enough. It should be cleaned regularly, as snakes will often defecate in the water. Shedding snakes can especially benefit from a bath to aid in the natural process.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>A variety of materials, or substrates, can be used to line the bottom of boa constrictor enclosures. The substrate can help to mimic the snake's natural environment, and it will maintain some humidity. For young snakes, lining the cage with paper or paper towels is often the best option for easy cleaning. For adults, paper can also be used, as well as reptile carpet. The benefit of carpeting is pieces can be cut to fit the enclosure, and a soiled piece can be replaced with a spare while the soiled piece is cleaned and disinfected. Some owners also use reptile bark, though it can be expensive. Wood shavings are best avoided due to irritation concerns and the potentialforaccidental ingestion and impaction.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Young boas should be fed more frequently than adults. Small snakes can be fed every five to seven days, intermediate snakes every 10 to 14 days, and fully grown snakes every three to four weeks. Adjust feeding to maintain a good body condition in your snake. And keep in mind that many snakes in captivity are overfed, so obesity can be a problem.</p><p>Hatchling snakes can be fed mice and rabbits (one per feeding) as they grow larger. An adult boa constrictor will eat a few rats for a meal or one rabbit every month. Never feed a snake aprey itemlarger than its widest body part.</p><p>Moreover, avoid handling your snake for at least 24 hours after a meal, or regurgitation might occur. Boas generally like to hide with their prey to eat it. So don't be surprised if your snake disappears into a hide box with itsmeal, and you don't see it for a while.</p><p>Feeding time is when the most care is required for handling boa constrictors (as with any other snake). Do not feed by hand, as this increases the risk of accidental bites if they mistake fingers for food. And wash your hands well after handling food, or the snake might strike at your hand. A handling stick can help to push the snake away from the cage door at feeding time to prevent problems.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>The most serious disease that can affect boa constrictors is inclusion body disease, or IBD. This is a fatal retrovirus that's similar to HIV in humans. An infected snake can appear healthy, as the virus can lay dormant for several years.</p><p>Symptoms of IBD include a boa breathing with its mouth open, poor appetite, and excessive amounts of saliva. In advanced cases, IBD can cause snakes to lose control of their bodily movements. Housing your boa constrictor in separate enclosures from other snakes is a way to prevent the spread of IBD; it can be transmitted from snake to snake via mites, which carry infected bodily fluids.</p><p>Boas are also susceptible to respiratory infections, mostly resulting from insufficiently heated enclosures. The signs of a respiratory infection include wheezing, nasal discharge, and holding its head up for long periods. If you see a foamy substance coming from a boa's mouth, this might be a sign of pneumonia, which requires immediate treatment.</p><p>Finally, poor husbandry practices can lead to scale rot and blister disease in boa constrictors. Blister disease can appear like burns on the snake's skin and is usually caused by overheated cages or a lack of humidity. Scale rot usually indicates a breakdown of the immune system. Both of these skin conditions require treatment by a specialist.</p><h2>Choosing Your Boa Constrictor </h2><p>When you are ready to purchase your pet boa constrictor, know how to identify a healthy snake.</p><p>As with other reptiles, it's best to choose a captive-bred specimen, and boa breeders are fairly easy to find given the animal's popularity. Captive-bred boas are generally healthier and more docile than their wild-caught counterparts. The prices can widely vary, depending on the type.</p>",1366
59,https://www.thesprucepets.com/king-snakes-and-milk-snakes-1237318,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Kingsnakes and Milk Snakes: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Kingsnakes and Milk Snakes: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>0</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Kingsnake, milk snake</p><p>Scientific Name: genus</p><p>Adult Size: 36 to 48 inches long (average adult)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30 years</p><h2>Kingsnake and Milk Snake Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>All varieties of kingsnakes are easy to handle after they get used to you. They are low maintenance, requiring minimal care throughout the week.</p><p>This snake rarely strikes; usually, if it does, it confused a finger with a prey item. A king or milk snake bite does not hurt. When it feels threatened, it will try to get away from you. It will also excrete a musky scent from its anal glands (smelly but not harmful) or rattle the tip of its tail, much like a rattlesnake would as a warning.</p><p>After letting a new snake settle for a few days after bringing it home, you can start handling your snake. Be gentle and persistent, with daily short sessions at first to build trust. It shouldn't take too long for the snake to get comfortable with handling. Do not handle snakes immediately after eating; it can cause them to regurgitate their meal.</p><p>These snakes are constrictors. They may try to wrap themselves around your arm, but they cannot harm you. To unwrap them, start from the tail end as their head tends to be stronger.</p><h2>Housing Your Kingsnake or Milk Snake </h2><p>A secure cage is vitally important. Kingsnakes are notorious for testing their enclosures and escaping from the smallest of spaces. The enclosure will require a securely latched top. These snakes can sneak through tiny gaps that seem too small. Leave no possible gaps, holes, or thin breaks in the cage top.</p><p>King and milk snakes should be kept solitary. Kingsnakes might eat other cage mates.</p><p>Hatchlings or the smaller New Mexico milk snake can live in a 10-gallon aquarium tank. However, medium-sized (36 inches) adult snakes need a 20-gallon tank,and larger, full-grown snakes (60 inches) would thrive in a larger enclosure, such as a 60-gallon tank. King and milk snakes are quite active and need the room. Snakes that have the room to stretch may also have a reduced incidence of respiratory infections.</p><p>Several hiding spots should be provided: Half rounds of bark, commercial rock hides, overturned flower pots, half coconut shells, and even cardboard boxes can be used. To give the cage a naturalistic feel, you can include rocks and branches in the cage.</p><p>You will need to clean the cage entirely at least every 6 months. In between these overhauls, spot clean or scoop out feces, and clean the water bowl every day.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Reptiles are cold-blooded creatures that need to self-regulate their body temperature by moving between warmer and cooler spots in their habitat. Provide a thermal gradient or range of temperatures in their enclosure from 70 to 85 F (21 to 28 C) during the day with a 10 to 15F (2 to 5C) drop at night. There should be hiding spots provided at each end of the gradient.</p><p>Most owners prefer under-tank heaters (placed under half the tank) to provide the heat. Never use electric hot rocks; they can cause burns. If using overhead heating, radiant heat sources like ceramic heat emitters are better than incandescent bulbs for nocturnal animals.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Primarily nocturnal, they do not need lighting as long as your room gets enough light to indicate the switch between night and day. Most nocturnal animals do not need ultraviolet light, although a UVB (5.0) fluorescent light can be beneficial to aid in calcium absorption from their food items.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>King and milk snakes do not need high humidity levels40 to 60 percent is sufficient. A hygrometer or humidity gauge will help you check moisture levels. In most cases, a shallow dish of water in the cage should be adequate. During shedding, they may benefit from added humidity. If you notice your snake is entering a shed phase (skin appears filmy, eyes turn a milky blue color), mist the cage lightly or provide a humidity box. You can make a simple humidity box out of a covered plastic container, cut a hole in the lid large enough for the snake to climb in, and line it with moistened sphagnum moss.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate is the bedding or lining for the bottom of your pet's cage. For new snakes, paper towels or butcher paper are ideal for facilitating cleaning and allowing you to monitor feces.</p><p>Various substrates that can be used include reptile carpeting, Astroturf, reptile bark, mulch, or aspen shavings (never use cedar, redwood, or pine). If shavings are used, make sure they are not ingested with the snake's food.</p><p>Reptile carpeting or Astroturf is the easiest, safest, and most economical option. It is washable and reusable. You can feed the snake on this surface without worrying about the snake eating the substrate, and you can have multiple pieces ready-cut for the cage when it gets soiled.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>King and milk snakes are fed mice or baby rats. As a general rule, feed the snake the size of a mouse that is roughly equal to the width of the snake at its widest part (excluding the head). Feed hatchlings and juveniles (subadult) twice a week. Adults can be fed adult mice (or weanling rats) once a week. If the snake is too lean (body not rounded, can see ribs or backbone) feed twice a week. Many king and milk snakes tend to eat less in the fall and winter.</p><p>As with other pet snakes, feed pre-killed mice (usually frozen from a pet supply source) to ensure that the prey cannot injure the snake. Thaw frozen mice to room temperature and feed in a separate feeding cage (with no substrate) or their cage if it has a safe flooring.</p><p>Since snakes often defecate in the water, clean out the dish daily, and refresh with fresh, filtered water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The biggest threat to a pet kingsnake or milk snake is a respiratory infection. These snakes can get colds or pneumonia, which is often caused by a problem with the temperature in the cage. Symptoms can include bubbling or gurgling at the mouth, gasping, or mucus around the nose.</p><p>If you notice regurgitated food items in the cage, it can be caused by handling the snake too soon after feeding. It is not necessarily a sign of illness, although it can be. Other reasons for regurgitated food: The food offered was too large, or the enclosure is too cool. If regurgitation recurs, take the snake to an exotics veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing Your Kingsnake or Milk Snake </h2><p>Milk and kingsnakes breed quite readily in captivity, so it should be relatively easy to find a captive-bred specimen. You can find reputable local breeders at a reptile expo or through a referral from another snake owner or an exotics vet. Make sure your snake is already a good eater of pre-killed mice. If you have doubts, ask for a demonstration of your snake feeding.</p><p>You can expect to pay $30 to $200, depending on the morph (color), the rareness of the variety, and age. Hatchlings usually cost less, since adults are proven eaters and thriving.</p><p>Signs of a healthy snake include a firm, rounded body; no discharge from the nose; no dusty specks on the body of the snake (mites); no open-mouth breathing or gasping; inside of mouth looks pink (not red or cheesy); shiny, smooth skin (no sores or scabs), clean fecal opening (vent), and movement without tremors.</p><p>A new snake may not be tame but should settle down reasonably well with gentle handling. A distressed snake will wave its body in the air, trying to escape. Most king and milk snakes will settle down after a bit and wrap gently around your hands.</p>",1353
60,https://www.thesprucepets.com/care-of-smooth-and-rough-green-snakes-1239231,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Green Snake Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Green Snake Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Rough and smooth green snakes are closely related, and while there are some differences between them, their care in captivity is essentially the same.These are both small, thin-bodied snakes that are native to North America, where their numbers are becoming threatened or endangered in many states. Both species are a bright emerald-green in color with a pale yellow or cream-colored belly; they are reported to take on a bluish tone when excited. In the pet trade, rough green snakes are seen more commonly than smooth green snakes, but both make good ""look only"" pets for the experienced reptile keeper. Since they are shy feeders and prefer quiet habitats, they are not the best match for a first-time snake keeper or for environments with young children.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Rough green snake,smooth green snake, grass snake, green whip snake, garden snake, vine snake, keeled green snake.</p><p>Scientific Names</p><p>Adult Size:Rough green snakes are roughly 2 to 3 feet long; smooth green snakes are smaller and shorter, at about 2 feet.</p><p>Life Expectancy:6 to 8 years; 15 years has been reported</p><h2>Green Snake Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Green snakes are green because they are arboreal; they spend most of their time hanging and hunting in plants and trees. Green snakes tend to be timid, shy snakes. They can be nervous and reluctant to feedand are therefore not recommended for beginner snake owners. Smooth and rough green snakes also tend to be stressed by handling, so they are better suited to just viewing.</p><h2>Housing the Green Snake </h2><p>Green snakes are small snakes, so while you don't need a huge tank, you do need to provide vertical space for climbing. As green snakes are peaceful, they can also be kept in groupsthree can live comfortably in a 30-gallon enclosure.</p><p>A 30-gallon hexagonal tank is a good choice because it provides lots of space for greenery as well as hiding spots. Since rough and smooth green snakes both have thin bodies, an escape-proof enclosureis a must. The tank will need a very tight-fitting fine mesh screen lid to prevent escapes. Clamped-down lids work best.</p><p>Green snakes that do not have lots of greenery to hide amongst will become stressed. These snakes are small enough that live plants such as pothos, ivy, and other nontoxic plants will do fine in the tank, and even silk plants will work in a pinch. The greenery should fill at least 50 percent of the tank. Branches and vines should also be provided for climbing. Also, include some hide boxes.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>An overhead heat source such as a heat bulb (white light during the day and red or blue/purple at night) or ceramic heat emitter is best. The overhead heat source can be supplemented by heat from an under tank heat mat, but make sure your snake cannot sit directly on the heated glass, because thermal burns may follow.</p><p>A suggested temperature gradient for green snakes is 70 to 80 F (21 to 27 C), though some references suggest a higher range. At night, the temperature can be allowed to drop to between 65 and 75 F (18 to 24 C).</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Being diurnal (day dwellers), these snakes should also have a UVA/UVB bulb on for 10 to 12 hours per day. Any visible light and any UVB light source should be turned off at night to give the snake a light-dark cycle.</p><p>Assuming your snake will not have access to bright sunlight, ZooMed's reptile or iguana lights, and Durotest's Vita-Lite are two good products. Replace the UVB light sources every six months.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>This species does not require high humidity. In addition to some occasional misting, the snake's water dish will add to the humidity in the tank which should be maintained at roughly 40 to 50 percent. Use a hygrometer to measure interior levels, and monitor closely during dry winter months if you are keeping your snake in a colder climate. A temporary increase of up to 60 percent humidity will assist any snake during its shedding process.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Materials that line the bottom of the enclosure (the substrate) should be carefully selected for both safety to green snakes and ease of cleaning. For these arboreal snakes, reptile carpet makes a good choice, as do simple paper towels or inklessnewspaper. Substrate materials that could accidentally be ingested are best avoided.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Green snakes are insectivoresand are among the few snakes that eat a diet consisting entirely of insects and worms. In the wild, they consume a variety of prey such as crickets, moths, grasshoppers, caterpillars, fly larvae, spiders, and worms.</p><p>In captivity, feed a diet consisting mainly of soft-bodied prey such as caterpillars, although itis extremely important to make sure the diet is still varied. As much as possible, add in items such as pesticide-free spiders, moths, flies, and their larvae.</p><p>Mealworms, grasshoppers, and crickets can be fed to green snakes but only occasionally, as any insects with tough exoskeletons may pose a risk of impaction if eaten too often. Pick only the freshly molted mealworms to reduce the chances. Other soft feeder worms, such as wax worms, could also be offered on occasion.Be sure that you don't offer any prey items that are wider than your snake's body.</p><p>All prey items should be gut-loaded, meaning that they have been fed a nutritious diet themselvesincluding a vitamin and mineral supplementbefore being offered to green snakes. Prey items should also be dusted with a calcium supplement a few times a week.</p><p>Feed your green snakes a few times on feeding day, totaling what they will eat over a 20-minute period. But feeding days should be only once or twice per week. Feeding at dawn or dusk will bring out a snake that is most willing to eat, but if your snake still is uninterested in food, try moving the enclosure to a more quiet room where there is less activity.</p><p>Like the arboreal lizards, these snakes prefer drinking water droplets off of leaves rather than from a bowl or other groundwater source, so a daily misting of the greenery is required. However, it is still important to provide a shallow dish of water that is large enough for the snake to climb into for a full-body soak, but shallow enough to prevent drowning.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>There are some health concerns that should receive care froma reptilian veterinarian. Both types ofgreensnakes are prone to fungal and respiratory infections. Open-mouthed breathing and wheezing are signs of a respiratory infection, and discoloration of the skin is usually a symptom of a fungal infection.</p><p>Another ailment common among snakes, including the green snake, is mouth rot, or infectious stomatitis. This bacterial infection of the mouth causes saliva bubbles and inflammation in and around the mouth. If left untreated, the snake's teeth may be lost when the infection reaches the bone.</p><h2>Choosing Your Green Snake </h2><p>There is concern about the declining populations of both of these snake species in the wild, possibly due to habitat loss and the use of pesticides. In some states, one or both of these species are considered threatened or endangered. Keep in mind that taking these snakes from the wild may be illegal depending on where you live; you may be further depleting an already declining population if they are endangered or even threatened in your area.</p><p>It is best to find a captive-bred green snakeaswild-caught specimensare much more likely to become significantly stressed and have a difficult time adjusting to captivity. Wild-caught snakes may also be carrying a heavyparasite load.</p>",1265

It gets its name from themarkings on its shell that resemble the large spotted cat with the same name. Before committing to getting this tortoise, consider more than just the beautiful looks of this sizeabletortoise; it is long-lived, requires a lot of space, and has specific needs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Leopard tortoise</p><p>Adult Size:12 to 28 inches long, weighing 33 to 118 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 80 to 100 years</p><h2>Leopard Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Like other tortoises, leopard tortoises are slow, quiet, and not aggressive. They're generally good-natured animals and not the most exciting of pets.</p><p>While a larger tortoise may mistake a finger for food, leopard tortoises are not known for biting people. They do not fancy frequently handling. If they feel threatened, they will likely retreat into their shells in their defense.</p><p>Unlike some other tortoise species, leopard tortoises aren't known to be climbers and don't burrow all that much. In the wild, males can get aggressive with other males during mating season, but in captivity, leopard tortoises are relatively docile.</p><p>They're not ideal for novice owners as they are somewhat high-maintenance compared to other tortoises. They need a large living space, protection from cool temperatures, and a varied, nutritious diet.</p><h2>Housing the Leopard Tortoise </h2><p>If you live in a cold climate, you may want to reconsider owning a leopard tortoise. These animals need hot temperatures year-round and have no tolerance for the cold. Due to its size and need for sunlight, leopard tortoises should be kept in a safe, outside enclosure as much as possible.</p><p>If you plan to have a leopard tortoise in your yard, its enclosure should have a place where it can hide. It needs to be fenced-in to help the tortoise feel secure and to protect it from predators. Do not house a leopard tortoise where even a well-meaning dog might encounter it; the situation may not end well for the tortoise. Tortoise hatchlings, for their first months of life, should remain housed indoors away from predators.</p><p>Make its enclosure like its natural habitat. Provide alfalfa and other grasses for it to graze on. Keep a shallow pan of water available for drinking, but make sure the tortoise does not get stuck in it.</p><p>In the wild, tortoises dig in the dirt to lay eggs, so provide bare ground for digging in its pen. Sun exposure is crucial for leopard tortoises and thus need a basking area where they can soak up vitamin D, which is essential for good health.</p><p>If you can't keep your tortoise outdoors year-round, be prepared to build a substantial indoor pen: an enclosure that is at least 10 feet by 10 feet with walls at least 2 feet high. If you have a small spare room in a warm area of your home, consider converting it into a tortoise haven.</p><p>Spot clean the tortoise's indoor or outdoor enclosure by removing visible pet wastes, and clean out its water dish daily.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>As cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature. Ideally, daytime temperatures should be between 75 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and nighttime temperatures should not go below 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Leopard tortoises cannot tolerate cooler or damp conditions. Provide a basking area that reaches 95 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're housing the animal indoors, use reptile heat bulbs or ceramic heater emitters to mimic these temperatures and include a temperature gradient.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Leopard tortoises need a mixture of sunlight and shade. It is not recommended to keep a leopard tortoise indoors. If a tortoise must be kept indoors, a full-spectrum UVB light is essential. If indoors, also provide a basking light that shines down on a basking spot, such as flat rocks that retain heat. The tortoise needs 10-12 hours of UVB exposure if indoors, but note that most UVB bulbs stop emitting UVM at six months, so check the recommendations on the brand you purchase.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Relative humidity of 40 percent to 60 percent is ideal for leopard tortoises during the day. These tortoises prefer 70 percent to 80 percent relative humidity at night, which can be accomplished by misting the substrate at night. Check moisture levels with a hygrometer or humidity gauge placed inside the cage.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most pet owners use a substrate or bedding to line the bottom of an enclosure. If your leopard tortoise lives primarily outdoors, where it can dig in the dirt and forage on the grass, a secondary indoor enclosure can use newspapers for the substrate. Change the newspaper liner frequently.</p><p>If your leopard tortoise's enclosure is primarily indoors, provide a grass or hay substrate or an organic soil-sand mixture to give the feel of its natural habitat. Make sure to feed your tortoise on a grass or solid substrate area and not on sand so your tortoise doesn't ingest sand.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Leopard tortoisesare herbivorous grazers; they feed throughout the day. About 98 percent of their diet should be comprised of high-fiber grasses and greens. Outdoor pesticide-free grass is suitable for grazing during warm weather. Their daily diet should consist primarily of grasses, weeds and dark leafy greens. Each day, at the same time daily, you can feed small amounts of other vegetables (dandelion greens, collard greens, watercress, carrots) on a bed of grass or hay.</p><p>Avoid feeding a leopard tortoise leafy greens that are high in oxalates, such as beet greens, Swisschard, and spinach. These greens and fruits in excess can bind calcium in the food and make this essential nutrient unavailable to the tortoises. Never feed dog food, cat food, or any other animal protein to your leopard tortoise. These foods can damage a tortoise's kidneys.</p><p>An indoor tortoise requires additional nutrients to make up for its lack of direct sunlight. Give your pet a high-quality tortoise food that includes calcium and vitamin D3 supplements. Tortoises can gnaw on pieces of cuttlebone, which can be found in the bird section of most pet stores, to promote provide extra calcium. For beak health, make sure your tortoise has enough fiber, via a hay substrate.</p><p>Change and clean its water pan daily and replenish it with filtered water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Captive leopard tortoises are incredibly susceptible to respiratory infections. These typically occur when the animal's enclosure is too humid. Another common and painful condition among tortoises is shell rot, which is caused by a fungal infection. Signs of shell rot include a dry, flaky shell that may have a foul odor.</p><p>Perhaps the most severe ailment that afflicts captive leopard tortoises is metabolic bone disease. This potentially fatal condition results from an imbalance in the tortoise's phosphorous-to-calcium ratio. Metabolic bone disease causes soft, weak bones and may result in deformity to the tortoise's limbs.</p><p>If caught in time, these medical conditions can be managed or treated by an exotics veterinarian who specializes in reptiles. Be sure to follow your vet's directions for care and treatment.</p><h2>Legality </h2><p>The United States banned the import of wild leopard tortoises in 2000 because many were infected with a tick that causes heartwater disease. This ailment can be devastating to livestock. It is still legal to breed and own captive, domestic leopard tortoises.</p><h2>Choosing Your Leopard Tortoise </h2><p>Due to the restrictions on importing leopard tortoises, make sure you're getting one from a reputable breeder who can produce documentation on the animal's history and health records.</p><p>A healthy tortoise has a smooth shell and clear eyes. If you can observe it eating, you'll note leopard tortoises are eating machines. If it's offered food and refuses it, that could be a sign the animal is unwell.</p><p>With a potential lifespan of 100 years, this is an animal that could outlive you. Be sure you make arrangements for your leopard tortoise's care if you are unable to care for it.</p>",1406
62,https://www.thesprucepets.com/star-tortoises-1239536,Reptiles & Amphibians > Tortoises,<h1>Indian Star Tortoises: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Indian Star Tortoises: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Indian star tortoises are easily recognizable by their beautifully star-patterned shells. Typically shy and small, relative to other tortoises, they prefer natural sunlight and life outdoors but can adapt to indoor living with adequate heat, lighting, and humidity. Indian star tortoises are native to the arid climates in India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, and are accustomed to monsoon seasons. If their environment isn't right, they are prone to illness. These tortoises are pretty to look at, not big on handling, and are difficult pets to keep.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Star tortoise, Indian Star Tortoise,</p><p>Adult Size: 7 to 12inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can live up to 80 years, though 30 to 55 years is more typical</p><h2>Indian Star Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Unlike some other tortoise species, star tortoises are not territorial. And, since they're small, you can house several of them together.They are not climbers.</p><p>Indian star tortoises do not like being handled. They can get stressed out and get ill if handled frequently, so these animals should not live in homes with small children.</p><p>Although these tortoises tend to be shy and do not like handling, they may grow more comfortable with an owner's occasional handling, especially when that owner brings them food.They rarely bite, but a nip may occur if the tortoise thinks a brightly colored toenail or fingernail is a flower petal.</p><p>Care for this tortoise is not complicated, but there are many factors you must monitor and maintain daily. Expect to spend at least 45 minutes per day preparing meals, changing the water bowl, and spot cleaning the cage.</p><h2>Housing the Indian Star Tortoise </h2><p>Even though they are smaller than most other tortoises, Indian star tortoises still need their space. They can be housed indoors in a large fish tank (55-gallon) or a plastic container, like an under-the-bed box or storage container. They don't need much height in their enclosure.</p><p>And, if you have other pets like cats or dogs, their cage will need to be completely enclosed, at least with a screen top, to protect them from other animals.</p><p>Outdoor enclosures should be roughly 6 feet by 6 feet with walls that your tortoise cannot see over. Star tortoises typically don't dig, so you shouldn't have to worry about burying the walls in the ground as you would with other types of tortoises. When the tortoise is left unsupervised outdoors, make sure you have a secure covering to safeguard your pet from wild predators, such as birds, raccoons, and opossums.</p><p>If you do not live in a dry region similar to their natural habitat, it can be tough to replicate their environment. To complicate matters, the tortoises are accustomed to a heavy rainy season in their native home and will require humidity to thrive.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>As cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature. If you have an outdoor enclosure, the temperature needs to reach at least 90 degrees. Your tortoise needs a basking spot from 90 to 95 F. At night, the temperature can drop to the 70s, but no lower than that. The enclosure should also have shade spots and a water bowl for the tortoise to fully submerge (and climb out of) to control its temperature. Indoors, your pet's enclosure will need the samea basking spot, a shady, hiding place, and a shallow container with clean, fresh water. The indoor enclosure is easier to control by adding or removing heat sources, such as light bulbs, ceramic heaters, and under tank heaters.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>These tortoises prefer the outdoors and need ultraviolet rays provided by the sunlight. If kept indoors, tortoises need UVB lighting. UVB helps the tortoise process vitamin D3, which affects calcium absorption. Inadequate UV exposure can lead to metabolic bone disease.</p><p>Some tortoise owners opt for a mercury vapor bulb, which is a combination UVB and heat light. Although, a 10 percent fluorescent UVB bulb works too. The UVB bulb should stay on for a 12-hour cycle. Replaced the bulb every six months. Even if the bulb doesn't burn out, the UV rays stop emitting by that time.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Provide a moist hide box that reaches up to 80 percent relative humidity and an abundant water bowl with a graduated slope, making it easy for the tortoise to climb in and out. A substrate that maintains humidity like peat moss or soil can also help add moisture to your pet's enclosure. To accurately monitor the humidity levels, use a hygrometer or humidity gauge, and check the measurements daily.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>These tortoises needsubstrate or bedding lining the enclosure made of organic potting soil (chemical- and vermiculite-free), peat moss, coconut fiber, or even hay or grass. Although they are not known to be big diggers, females will shovel down into the substrate to make a shallow nest for eggs.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Star tortoises are herbivores. Give plenty of fresh and dark leafy greens and grasses. Timothy hay, Bermuda grass, orchard grass, ryegrass, alfalfa, and fescue are all acceptable. Never feed your Indian star tortoise dog or cat food.</p><p>Fresh greens suitable for tortoises include kale, endive, parsley, dandelion greens, escarole, spineless cactus leaves, and mustard greens; these greens have a higher calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, which is healthier for the star tortoise. Dust an additional calcium powder on their greens daily. Occasionally, you can offer a small bit of fruit as a treat.</p><p>Feed it once daily at the same time every day from several food trays spread throughout the enclosure to replicate foraging. Give them as much food as they will eat within 15 to 30 minutes, or you can estimate the pile of food to offer as about the size of the animal's shell.</p><p>Change and clean its water container daily and replenish it with filtered water, if available.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Pet tortoises raised in the wild are more likely to suffer from respiratory infections, but they're relatively common among captive tortoises as well. Respiratory infections usually are caused by unsanitary conditions or insufficient humidity. Early signs of a respiratory infection include wheezing and a lack of appetite. Still, a sick tortoise also may appear lethargic and have excess mucus around its mouth and nasal passages.</p><p>Star tortoises, like most other turtles and tortoises, are susceptible to metabolic bone disease, which occurs when the animal isn't getting the proper balance of calcium and phosphorous. Tortoises and most other reptiles need exposure to ultraviolet radiation to be able to absorb calcium. Tortoises in the wild typically bask in the sun for most of their waking hours, which is how they get this UV exposure.</p><p>If a tortoise doesn't get enough calcium, its shell may not grow at an average rate. Older star tortoises with metabolic bone disease may have difficulty walking and suffer bone fractures.</p><p>These medical conditions are treatable by anexotics veterinarianwho specializes in reptiles. Be sure to follow your vet's directions for care and treatment.</p><h2>Choosing Your Indian Star Tortoise </h2><p>Star tortoises are long-lived pets that require a long-term commitment. Depending on when you get your pet and its age, it may outlive you. Some pet owners make arrangements for their pet tortoises in their wills.</p><p>If you are set on an Indian star tortoise, your best source will be a reputable breeder. For a local lead on a breeder, inquire at a nearby exotics veterinarian, ask your area reptile rescue, or meet breeders at a regional reptile expo.</p><p>Captive-bred animals are less likely to have parasitic infections, and a reputable breeder has information on their breeding, birthdate, and health history. You can expect to pay $600 to $3000; babies usually cost the least and breeding females can generally cost more.</p><p>Before bringing it home, examine the tortoise's shell. Tortoises with patchy dry spots on their shells are likely suffering from shell rot, caused by a fungal infection. If the tortoise seems lethargic or doesn't eat offered food, it may be ill. A healthy tortoise has clear eyes and skin, and its shell should be smooth and mostly free of blemishes.</p>",1404

A popular pet with striking shell coloring and markings, red-footed tortoises are long-lived and relatively easy to care for. If you're thinking of getting one, expect to make a significant investment in equipment, food, and your living space for what could be a 50-year commitment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Red-footed tortoise, redfoot tortoise, redleg tortoise, Savannah tortoise</p><p>Adult Size:10 to 16 inches, up to 30 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 50 years in captivity</p><h2>Red-Footed Tortoise Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These animals are not high-maintenance, as long as you set up their enclosure correctly the first time with proper lights, heat source, humidity, and put everything on timers. The main daily chores involve feeding, water bowl changes, and cleaning up pet wastes.</p><p>In captivity, these cute tortoises act shy, hide often, or burrow; this is usually a stress response when around predators. In general, they prefer not to be handled but are docile and easy-going. Despite not having teeth, their beaks are strong, and they can bite. While bites are rare and usually unintentional, they can hurt.</p><p>As a rule, you should prevent small children from handling turtles and tortoises, mostly due to the possibility of spreading salmonella. This bacteria lives in the intestinal tract of most reptiles, and it can cause illness in humans. Good hand-washing hygiene can prevent bacterial infection.</p><p>Unlike some other breeds of tortoise, the red-footed are relatively active during the day. In the wild, they spend most of their time digging and foraging. If they've eaten a large meal, however, they can spend as long as a week resting.</p><p>Wild red-footed tortoises are prolific burrowers. They burrow to seek shelter, cool down from the heat, and hide from predators. They feel most secure in a hiding spot where they fit tightly, such as a tree trunk, sometimes wedging several tortoises in at once.</p><p>Also, in the wild, red-footed tortoises often display social behavior, such as sharing food and gathering in small groups. They're not overly territorial of nesting or feeding sites unless two males are competing over a female.</p><h2>Housing the Red-Footed Tortoise </h2><p>An ideal enclosure for the red-footed tortoise is a sturdy, escape-proof enclosure outside. This species is native to tropical areas and prefers a humid climate. Set up a sprinkler or mister to increase the humidity if needed. This tortoise loves a muddy wallow or puddle for cooling off. You can sink a shallow water pan into the ground but make sure the tortoise can safely climb out of it.</p><p>If possible, provide a shady area densely planted with vegetation for a cool retreat. A doghouse-type shelter can also work as a shady spot. The walls of the enclosure should be about 16 inches high and even go a few inches below the ground to prevent your red-footed tortoise from digging and escaping.</p><p>You can house this tortoise indoors, but you will need a large enclosure (roughly 4 feet by 8 feet though larger is even better).</p><p>For cleaning, spot clean or scoop out pet wastes. Clean and disinfect the water container daily.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>As cold-blooded creatures, all reptiles need to regulate their body temperature. They need a thermal gradient or spectrum of temperatures so that they can keep their body temperature at an optimal level. The average daytime temperaturewhether outside or indoorsshould be 85 F to 90 F. The tortoise will also need a basking spot that reaches up 95 F.</p><p>If the temperature drops lower than 80 F, you will need to add a heat source. If nighttime temperatures drop to 70 F or lower, heat the outdoor shelter to 70 F or bring in your tortoise to an environmentally controlled indoor enclosure. Temperatures lower than 70 F put the animal at risk for developing a respiratory infection or hypothermia.</p><p>Red-footed tortoises do not hibernate, but they may start to slow down during the colder months, even if housed indoors.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Full-spectrum ultraviolet light is necessary for an indoor enclosure since your tortoise will not get unfiltered sunlight. Tortoises require UVB rays to synthesize vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 helps the tortoise absorb calcium, which is crucial for bone structure and growth. All indoor enclosures should include a10 percent fluorescent UVB tubelight with areflectorto spread the UVB rays downward to the tortoise.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>These tortoises do well in 50 percent to 70 percent humidity.A pan of water should be provided at all times for your red-footed tortoise to walk into as well as a dig box of moist organic dirt or sphagnum moss at least 6 inches deep. Use a hygrometer or humidity gauge inside the cage to monitor moisture levels accurately.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most pet owners use a substrate or bedding to line the bottom of the cage. In the case of tortoises, they need it for digging. Use cypress bark, orchid bark, or sphagnum moss as a substrate, which also helps retain humidity. Paper will also work and is easy to clean. Change the substrate every one to two weeks to prevent mold and excessive bacterial growth.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>In the wild, red-footed tortoises are omnivores. They eat a more extensive range of foods than many other tortoises. Leafy greens, fruits, and other vegetables make up their main diet.</p><p>The ratio for a well-balanced red-footed tortoise diet is 60 percent dark leafy greens and grasses, 15 percent vegetables, 15 percent fruit, and 10 percent tortoise pellets or animal protein. Feed the amount of food they will eat within 15 to 30 minutes, or you can estimate the amount of food to offer as being equal to the size of the shell. Feed them daily, in the morning, usually around the same time every day.</p><p>The best dark, leafy greens for red-footed tortoises include dandelion greens, endive, mustard greens, and escarole. Avoid feeding large amounts of kale, spinach, and broccoli, these can be offered, but only in tiny amounts.</p><p>Red-footed tortoises tolerate fruit better than many other tortoise species. Different vegetables and fruits that are good to feed regularly include carrots, parsnip, sweet potato, papaya, figs, and hard melons. They can eat about 1 ounce of animal protein once every two weeks in the form of moistened low-fat cat food or lean meat. Add calcium and vitamin D3 supplements to their food three times a week. You can also offer tortoise pellets that are enriched with vitamins and minerals.</p><p>Replenish its water pan daily with fresh, filtered water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Red-footed tortoises are prone to several medical conditions that are treatable by an exotics veterinarian who specializes in reptiles.</p><h2>Choosing Your Red-Footed Tortoise </h2><p>Due to habitat loss and capture for the pet trade, this tortoise's wild population has declined significantly. If you want a red-footed tortoise as a pet, get a captive-bred one from a reputable breeder. Your best connection to a reputable breeder may be through personal referrals from other reptile owners, a reptile specialist vet, or a local reptile show or expo where you can meet the breeders.</p><p>You can expect to pay $150 to $500 for a red-footed tortoise. The price goes up for older tortoises, factoring in the cost to raise them to adulthood and that they are thriving.</p><p>Signs of a healthy tortoise include clear, discharge-free eyes, nose, and mouth. Also, check that its fecal vent is clean. Avoid purchasing a lethargic or non-responsive tortoise or any tortoise that has flaking or crustiness on the shell (shell rot).</p>",1299
