They can learn to be comfortable when handled by people and can be quite playful and cuddly. Native to North America, skunks are known for their scent glands that can spray foul-smelling chemicals at predators. However, captive-bred skunks typically have those glands surgically removed. This is a controversial procedure, as some people believe it strips away a necessary defense mechanism that a pet skunk would need should it ever get loose outside or otherwise be attacked. For this reason, it's critical to keep your pet skunk indoors or highly supervised during any outdoor time.</p><p>Housing a pet skunk can be somewhat difficult, as skunks tend to be curious animals that like to get into mischief. It can also be complicated to feed a pet skunk a balanced diet, as there are few formulated skunk foods available. Overall, these animals require a lot of time and expertise on your part to care for them properly.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Skunk</p> <p>Adult Size: 20 to 31 inches long; up to 15 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Skunk? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>If you're looking to own a pet skunk, one of the first things you should do is check the laws at the state and local levels where you live. Owning a domesticated skunk is not legal in every state, and places where it is legal may still require additional permits or permissions. Currently, you can legally own a pet skunk in the following states: Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>As with all pets, it's important to consider whether or not you have the means and energy to care for a pet skunk. They have many care requirements and thus are not suitable for beginner pet owners, or those who don't want to dedicate much time to their pets.</p><h2>Skunk Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Skunks are not low-maintenance pets in addition to feeding and cleaning up after your skunk, you should expect to spend several hours per day keeping it entertained. Some of a skunk's personality traits, such as being stubborn and headstrong, can make it a challenge to live with. Fortunately, pet skunks also tend to be sociable and playful when they grow up interacting with people. They are active and curious, which means they will get into everything in your home. They can learn to open cabinets, drawers, and even the refrigerator. If certain items such as towels, blankets, and clothing go missing, your skunk might have stolen them to make its bed softer.</p><p>In the wild, skunks are most active at dawn and dusk, but a pet skunk can learn to be on its human's schedule. These animals need lots of stimulation and many enjoy playing with dog or cat toys. They're also natural diggers and might dig into a carpet or scratch furniture if they don't have enough toys of their own. As social animals, skunks generally enjoy being handled by and playing with their human family members. They can even learn to get along with other friendly pets in the house, such as a ferret or even a gentle cat or dog.</p><p>Skunks do make a variety of vocalizations to express their emotions, including hisses, chirps, and whines, but in general, they're quiet animals. They're also not prone to aggression when properly socialized, but they will bite if they feel threatened. This can have serious consequences as rabies is transmitted through saliva and there is not a vaccine specifically formulated for domestic skunks. If your pet skunk bites a person or another animal, authorities might seize it to monitor for rabies symptoms. Some pet skunks have even been euthanized after biting.</p><h3>Watch Now: What to Know Before Adopting a Pet Skunk</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>It's best to keep a pet skunk indoors, as it won't have its spraying defense against predators. Most people allow their skunks to roam their homes while they are there to monitor them. Some owners even set up entire rooms, such as a small bedroom, as ""skunk playrooms."" This way, you can keep most of your skunk's toys and bed in one room and limit its access to parts of your home that are unsafe for it (as well as prevent it from getting into items you don't want damaged).</p><p>You can keep your skunk in a large dog kennel whenever you're away from home to make sure it stays safe. However, skunks don't tolerate being housed in a cage for extended periods, so aim to keep their time in the kennel to only a few hours. Furthermore, skunks can be trained to use a litter box like a cat or ferret. So make sure it always has access to its litter box, and plan to scoop out the litter daily.</p><p>Ensure that your home is escape-proof to keep your skunk safe. That means closely monitoring any open doors and windows. If your skunk gets loose, it can cover miles in a day. Skunks generally lack a homing instinct, so once your skunk is gone, it likely won't be able to find its way back home. However, you can safely take your pet skunk outdoors on a harness and leash for exercise and enrichment.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>If you choose to keep your skunk in a kennel or pen part of the time, you'll want to provide them with a soft and cushioned place to sleep. You can opt for a typical pet bed, like that for a small cat or dog, or simply provide them with a pile of blankets to curl up in.</p><h2>What Does a Skunk Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, skunks are omnivores, eating nearly anything they can find. As pets, young skunks should be fed several times a day while adult skunks can be fed in the morning and evening. Simply put out their meals in a bowl for them. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate timing and quantity of food for your particular animal.</p><p>There are a few pre-packaged, formulated diets available for skunks. You're more likely to find these via online stores rather than your local pet shop. If you aren't using a formulated food, your skunk's diet should be roughly 60 to 70 percent lean protein, such as cooked chicken, eggs, fish, or feeder insects. The rest of their diet should primarily be fresh, cooked, or thawed frozen vegetables. Avoid canned vegetables, which can have an excess of salt.</p><p>Nuts, cooked grains, a small amount of dog food, and plain yogurt can also be mixed into your skunked diet. Fruit can be given as a treat but not every day. Avoid chocolate, as it is toxic to pets. Also, try to offer your skunk foods high in calcium and taurine, or give it supplements that provide these. Finally, skunks need access to a dish of fresh water at all times, though some don't drink a lot. They get much of the water they need from the vegetables in their diet.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Be aware that it can be difficult to find a veterinarian who specializes in skunks, so ensure that you will be able to see one before acquiring a pet skunk. Plan on at least an annual wellness exam for your animal, but having someone to call in emergencies is a good idea too.</p><p>Like all pets, skunks should be spayed or neutered as young as four months old to prevent aggression. It's also a common preventative step pet owners can take to reduce the risk of hormonal cancers. Removing the scent glands may be done at the same time, though this is often done at an even younger age while the skunks are still with the breeder. Skunks also need to be vaccinated against common dog and cat diseases, such as distemper, as well as dewormed. Your veterinarian should be able to recommend the correct course of vaccinations.</p><p>Skunks are prone to a variety of health issues, including metabolic bone disease, diabetes, dental disease, nutritional deficiencies, cardiac disease, and obesity. A proper diet can prevent or minimize many of these problems, so regularly discuss your pet's diet with your vet.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Skunks have moderate exercise needs, but oftentimes their needs will be fulfilled simply by exploring their home environment. Skunks can be taken on walks or played with outdoors, but you should be mindful of taking them outdoors in the early morning or evening hours, as they can easily overheat. Mental exercise is just as important to skunks, so make sure they have plenty of toys to play with and stay entertained.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Skunks have average grooming needs, similar to that of a low maintenance dog. Brush your skunk at least once a week, making sure to work out any knots, and working to get your skunk used to being handled. You should also brush your skunk's teeth at least every other week, and clean their ears and trim their nails periodically.</p><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Skunks will go through their shedding period two times per year, in both the fall and spring. During this period of time, frequent brushing is especially important, as it helps your skunk shed their fur properly.</p><h3>Bathing </h3><p>Bathe your skunk periodically (around once a month) or as needed if they get dirty while playing outdoors. The process is similar to how you would bathe a dog you can feel free to wash them in your tub, and skunks will often enjoy swimming and splashing in the water during bath time. You can wash them with a mild tear free baby or dog shampoo.</p><h2>Training Your Skunk </h2><p>The most important aspect to ""training"" your pet skunk is spending time with them. The more they bond with you, the more they'll respect you and behave. Offense is important when housing a pet skunk they are very curious creatures and will explore every corner of your home. Invest in baby gates and child-proof cabinet locks to keep your skunk out of areas you don't want them in.</p><h3>Potty Training </h3><p>Skunks can successfully be trained to use a litter box to go to the bathroom, similar to cats. Skunks will have an innate desire to use the bathroom in the corner of rooms, so your best bet is to put the litter box into the corner of the room to begin training them.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Skunk as a Pet </h2><p>Skunks can be surprisingly sweet and playful companions, making them a unique pet choice for owners who live in a state where they're permitted. That being said, it's important to consider your ability to properly care for a pet skunk before purchasing one. The care and time commitment for a pet skunk is similar to that of a dog or cat, so make sure you understand what you're getting into before purchasing one.</p><p>It's also important to consider what to do if something goes wrong while owning a pet skunk. Most states where skunk ownership is legal still mandate the reporting of a skunk bite, regardless of your pet's exposure to rabies. If your skunk happens to bite someone or your vet reports an incident, it could result in your pet being taken away from you.</p>",1876
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pot-bellied-pigs-as-pets-1237171,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Potbellied Pig as a Pet? </h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Potbellied Pig as a Pet? </h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Potbellied pigs are often classified more as livestock than as pets, but they can be charming, intelligent, and affectionate companions. There's no doubt that, when given the proper care and training, a potbellied pig can make a much-loved addition to a home.</p><p>However, some people don't realize the demands of keeping pigs as pets and are overwhelmed by their needs. Pigs are quite smart and curious, so it can be difficult to keep them entertained. Plus, it can be hard to manage a healthy diet for a pig, largely because of their insatiable appetite. Overall, expect to spend a lot of time each day socializing with your pet pig, as well as keeping it exercised through play and outdoor time.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Potbellied pig</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:3 feet long on average; weighs between 100 and 200 pounds</p><p>Lifespan:12 to 18 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pot Bellied Pig? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Potbellied pigs are legal in many areas, though some places classify them as livestock and require certain types of enclosures and permits. Other places allow pigs up to a certain size to be kept as pets, as long as they are kept on a leash or in an enclosed area outdoors. Because state laws generally treat pigs as legal livestock, it's your local laws that you'll need to pay close attention to.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Oftentimes, ethically owning an animal comes down to whether or not you can provide it with what it needs to thrive. In the case of potbellied pigs, they will need ample land, care, companionship, and mental stimulation. As long as you are able to provide your pig with all that it needs, it would be considered ethical to own one.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Potbellied pigs come in many sizes, and this becomes a problem when you think you're adopting an adorable little piglet that then grows into a 200-pound pet. Do your homework, know what you're buying, and ask yourself if you can handle or even want to have a pet this large.</p><h2>Potbellied Pig Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Some people equate having a pig with having a dog. While the species share some characteristics, such as their social and playful nature, pigs do still have a unique set of behaviors. Pigs are very intelligent and trainable they can be house trained, learn to walk on a leash, and even perform some tricks. However, they are generally a bit headstrong and sensitive. A person must earn their cooperation through lots of positive reinforcement, especially treats.</p><p>A pig's high level of intelligence means it will become bored and potentially destructive when it doesn't have enough activities and social interaction. By nature, pigs like to root around (use their snouts to search) for food, which can potentially cause them to knock over objects in your home and tear up your yard in the process. Hiding some of their daily food in treat puzzles or in a portion of your yard where you don't mind them rooting can help satisfy this behavior.</p><p>Like dogs, pigs can form close bonds with humans. They also can learn to coexist peacefully with other animals in the house, especially when raised together from a young age. In fact, keeping multiple friendly pigs together is often better than having just one pig due to their social nature.</p><p>Pet pigs love to be scratched and massaged by their humans, and many will happily sit next to you and cuddle. They're generally friendly animals, though they can become aggressive toward people or other animals if they feel threatened, frightened, or territorial.Spaying or neutering your pig can help to control hormones that often lead to aggression. In addition, pigs can produce some extremely loud vocalizations when they express their emotions. If you're looking for a quiet pet, a pig isn't it.</p><p>Pigs need to be taught to respect their owners by having rules and boundaries. This is one of the most important factors for a pet pig's overall care. Consistently praise good behaviors, and aim to redirect or give a firm ""no"" to bad behaviors. Repetition and patience are key in producing a well-mannered potbellied pig that has a good relationship with its family.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Charming Pot-Bellied Pig</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>Pigs are smart and curious, so you'll need to pig-proof any areas of your house where the pig will have access, much like you'd baby-proof a home for a toddler. Cover electrical sockets, make sure stairs are off-limits, and remove tripping hazards such as cords and rugs. Although they can be destructive if they don't have enough of their own toys to play with, pigs are fairly clean animals. You can even potty train your pig to use a litter box or go outside by using praise or healthy treats as a reward.</p><p>Give your pig a space of its own, such as a large crate or tent. Having that personal space can help a pig feel calm.Also, it's ideal to provide an indoor rooting box filled with rocks and other natural materials where your pig can use its snout to search for little bits of food you place in the box. And finally, your pig needs exercise to prevent constipation, so regular access to the outdoors for playtime and walks is a necessity.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Any time you visit a farm, you're bound to notice pigs in a pen covered in hay. While not a must-have (especially if you're allowing your pig to sleep indoors), hay can be a good bedding material when keeping your pig outdoors. If not readily available, you can also opt to use pine shavings, wood chips, fallen leaves and more.</p><h2>What Do Potbellied Pigs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>True to their reputation, pigs can be unrelenting in their quest for food. They can learn to open the fridge, cupboards, and pantry anywhere they think food might be lurking. They also can become demanding, begging for food and even getting aggressive with people who have food.</p><p>Your pig's diet should include pig pellets that are low in protein and fat and high in fiber. Follow the pellet instructions and consult your veterinarian for the appropriate amount to feed. Additionally, fresh, nonstarchy vegetables should make up 25 percent of the pig's daily diet. You also can provide alfalfa hay or bran for fiber, and many veterinarians recommend giving a pet pig a multivitamin.</p><p>Many owners opt to feed two meals per day in the morning and evening in a bowl, as well as scatter some of the pig's daily diet in a designated rooting area for mental enrichment. In fact, rooting in the dirt is also a way for your pig to take in minerals, including iron and selenium. Finally, make sure a large bowl of fresh water is available at all times.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Thanks to their healthy appetite, pigs are easily overfed and many become obese when they are adults, which can lead to arthritis and other serious diseases. A fat rollover on your pig's eyes indicates that the pet is overweight. If that's the case, discuss your pig's diet with your veterinarian and avoid feeding your pig fatty or salty foods, as well as table scraps. Make sure everyone in your household is on board with not giving the pig extra snacks.</p><p>If your pig stops eating, that's typically a sign that something is wrong. Some possibilities include an infection or a gastrointestinal blockage. If this occurs, consult a vet as soon as possible.</p><p>Pigs that are overheated may be depressed, inactive, and recumbent and show open-mouth breathing or panting with an initial fever followed by a subnormal and decreasing temperature. If you notice this, make sure the pig has access to a shady, cool spot. Moreover, pigs with light skin are prone to sunburn and skin cancer. In addition to shade, it's ideal to use sunscreen on them whenever they go outside.</p><p>One of the most common ailments in potbellied pigs is mange, a skin condition caused by mites. Pigs get dry, scaly, and itchy skin when afflicted with mange. If you notice this, have a veterinarian see your pig. An annual wellness check by a veterinarian who specializes in potbellied pigs is recommended. In addition, regular hoof trims are necessary throughout a pig's lifetime to prevent foot and leg problems.</p>",1372
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guinea-pigs-as-pets-1236837,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Guinea Pig</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Guinea Pig</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Guinea pigs are a species of rodent that enjoys great popularity as an exotic pet. There are several varieties of guinea pigs with different coat types and color patterns. The most common are the American (short, smooth coat), Abyssinian (short coat with swirls called rosettes), and Peruvian (long coat). There also are hairless varietiescalled skinny pigs. As pets, guinea pigs are typically friendly and docile. Their care is moderately time-consuming but straightforward. Their housing is fairly easy to set up and maintain, and their diets are readily available at most pet stores.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Guinea pig, cavy, domestic cavy</p> <p>Adult Size: Approximately 8 to 19 inches long, weighing 2 to 3 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 6 to 8 years; some live up to 10 years</p><h2>Guinea Pig Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Guinea pigs are social animals, so it's recommended to keep them in same-sex pairs or small groups to prevent loneliness and boredom. A pair of females is the better option, as two males will sometimes fight, especially if they're not neutered. It's best not to let your guinea pig interact with other pets in the household especially any predatory animals such as dogs, cats, and ferrets as they can be easily injured.</p><p>As pets, guinea pigs might be nervous at first, but they rarely bite. With frequent handling, they generally become tame and comfortable being picked up and carried around. Guinea pigs will bond with the people who take care of them most, and many enjoy cuddling with their owners. Some also will squeal out of excitement when they see their favorite people. Guinea pigs have a range of personalities, from shy to outgoing. But overall they are gentle and affable pets.</p><p>Moreover, while they're usually quiet animals,guinea pigs can make some fairly loud vocalizations, especially when they're squealing for excitement about a meal. They also sometimes make a deep purring sound when they're relaxed. They're typically active during the day, though they occasionally wake up and move around at night. So you might not want to keep their enclosure in your bedroom if you're a light sleeper.</p><p>Guinea pigs can be a greater time commitment than some people might expect from such a small animal. Plan to spend at least a few hours per day giving your pet attention out of its enclosure, allowing it to exercise and explore. And in addition to daily feedings, expect to spend time cleaning the enclosure at least once a week.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Cuddly Guinea Pigs</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Guinea pigs stretch between 8 and 19 inches long on average. And they weigh around 2 to 3 pounds. They grow rapidly during their first four months and then fully fill out at around a year old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Guinea pigs need as large of a cage as you can fit and afford. Many pet shop cages marketed for guinea pigs are actually too small. Remember their cage is their primary space for exercise unless you're able to take your pet out and monitor it for most of the day. One of the best options is a cage with a plastic base and wire top, which allows for good airflow.</p><p>One guinea pig should have a cage that is at least 30 inches by 36 inches. For two guinea pigs, get a cage that's at least 30 inches by 50 inches. A height of around 18 inches is fine. The floor space is more important than the height, as guinea pigs generally don't climb.</p><p>In the cage, add a small animal hideout or nest, which you can find at most pet stores, where your guinea pig can go to feel secure and rest.And add some guinea pig toys for chewing and play, which also are available at most pet stores.</p><p>Place the cage in a fairly quiet part of your home. Loud noises and sudden movements can easily stress a guinea pig. Also, make sure the cage is out of direct sunlight and away from drafts.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Always use a cage with a solid bottom and not a wire grate, as this can damage the feet of a guinea pig. Add a 2-inch layer of paper bedding at the bottom. Avoid cedar and pine bedding, which can irritate a guinea pig's respiratory system.</p><h2>What Do Guinea Pigs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Guinea pigs are herbivores, meaning they eat plants. Offer your guinea pig an unlimited amount of timothy hay every day. You can simply lay this in the enclosure or use a special feeder known as a hayrack. Just make sure some is always available. This aids digestion and helps to wear down their teeth, which grow continuously.</p><p>Also, select a commercial pelleted food formulated for guinea pigs to feed each day. The pellets should be fortified with vitamin C, as guinea pigs cannot produce this vitamin on their own. Follow the package instructions for how much to feed. Many owners put a day's worth of pellets in a small bowl in their guinea pig's enclosure in the morning and dispose of any uneaten pellets before the next day's feeding.Opt for a ceramic bowl over a plastic or stainless steel one, so your guinea pig won't be able to tip it over.</p><p>To supplement the hay and pellets, offer a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables each day in another small bowl separate from the pellets. You can feed these at any point during the day, but they should not exceed 10 percent of the total daily diet. Some good options include romaine lettuce, kale, and cilantro, as well as carrots, zucchini, kiwi, and blueberries. Keep the sugary fruits to a minimum as a treat just a few times a week. And always consult your veterinarian to make sure you're feeding the appropriate quantity and variety of foods.</p><p>Finally, guinea pigs always need access to clean water. Aim to get your guinea pig using a water bottle that attaches to the side of the enclosure as soon as possible. Water bottles won't spill or become contaminated like a water dish can. But don't remove the water dish until you're sure your animal is consistently drinking from the bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Guinea pigs are generally hardy animals, but they are subject to a few common health problems.</p><p>Guinea pigs might develop diarrhea and other digestive issues from bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Antibiotics also can affect a guinea pig's digestive system.</p><p>There are some health issues that specifically affect a guinea pig's eyes. Sometimes, a guinea pig will scratch its eye on something in its environment. Or it might develop an eye infection, often from unsanitary living conditions. The eye might become watery, crusty, and red.</p><p>Furthermore, if your guinea pig's diet doesn't have enough vitamin C, it can develop scurvy. A guinea pig with scurvy might lose its appetite, appear to be in pain, and have bleeding gums. Scurvy can be fatal, so consult your vet immediately if you notice any of these symptoms.</p><p>A diet that doesn't have enough hay can cause a guinea pig's teeth to become overgrown. This can result in them not being able to bite down properly and chew their food. So if you notice a lack of appetite or weight loss in your guinea pig, have your vet check its teeth. The vet can trim the teeth if necessary and then suggest diet adjustments.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians treat guinea pigs. So before even acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet nearby who will see it.</p><h2>Training </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Some guinea pigs can be trained to use a litter box. Select a small litter box with short walls, and fill it with a different bedding from what you use in the rest of the cage. Also, it can be helpful to add some soiled bedding. Place the litter box in a spot where your guinea pig tends to relieve itself, and treat it when it jumps in and explores the box. Then, treat it every time you see it relieving itself in the box. If it starts relieving itself in a new spot instead, move the litter box there (or get a second box if you can fit it). Eventually your guinea pig might start to see the box as its toilet.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Regular exercise is essential for guinea pigs to help prevent obesity and other health issues. Playing with your guinea pig in a secure area outside of the enclosure for a few hours per day will help it get both physical activity and mental stimulation. Plus, within the enclosure it can be helpful to place the sleeping area on one side and the food on another, so your guinea pig has to get up and move around. Selecting an enclosure with a second level accessible via a ramp (with a solid floor, not wires) also can encourage physical activity.</p>",1463
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinese-hamsters-1238946,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chinese Hamster</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chinese Hamster</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Chinese hamsters, also known as Chinese striped hamsters or Chinese dwarf hamsters, are small rodents native to deserts of China and Mongolia. They're not technically dwarf hamsters, but they received that name due to their small size in comparison to other common pet hamsters, such as the Syrian hamster. They're typically brown with a black stripe running down their back and a lighter belly. They also have a longer tail than most other hamsters. As pets, these hamsters are fairly simple to care for. They are generally docile and easy to tame, though some can be a little skittish and nippy. Plus, their housing doesn't take up much space, and their diet is easy to find in most pet stores.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Chinese hamster, Chinese striped hamster, Chinese dwarf hamster</p> <p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches long, weighing 1 to 2 ounces</p><p>Lifespan: 2 to 3 years</p><h2>Chinese Hamster Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Chinese hamsters are nocturnal, meaning they sleep by day and are awake at night. But they sometimes might wake up during the day to eat and move around for a short time. Still, it's best not to wake a sleeping hamster to handle it. That likely will make it grouchy, and it might try to bite you.</p><p>As pets, these hamsters are generally good-natured and comfortable being held if you've consistently handled them from a young age. But if they're not used to handling, some can be nervous and nippy. Moreover, because they are very small and quick, they can be difficult to handle. It's best to sit on the floor when holding your hamster, as accidentally dropping it from even a few feet high can cause serious injury.</p><p>Chinese hamsters won't bond with people like a dog or cat would. But once they're comfortable around you, they might come to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby. Chinese hamsters can either be kept alone or in same-sex pairs or small groups. However, hamsters kept together might display territorial aggression toward one another. Your best bet to avoid aggression is to acquire littermates that can grow up together and become accustomed to each other's presence. Avoid contact between your hamster and any other pets in the house, as they might injure this small, fragile rodent.</p><p>They are generally low-maintenance, quiet pets, though they might keep you awake at night with their activity if you have their cage in your bedroom. Expect to spend a few hours each week on feedings and keeping the enclosure clean. Also, handle your pet and let it play in a small hamster exercise ball or other safe area outside of its enclosure for at least a few hours per day (likely in the evening once it's awake).</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Chinese hamsters range between 3 and 5 inches long on average, weighing 1 to 2 ounces. They reach maturity at around 2 months old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>While these hamsters are tiny, they still need as large of an enclosure as you can fit and afford. This is typically their primary space for play and exercise, so having enough space is crucial for their health. At minimum, the cage should be 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot high.</p><p>Cage options are generally either one with a plastic base and wire top or a glass or plastic aquarium. The wire cage will allow for better airflow, but you have to make sure the bar spacing is narrow enough that your hamster can't squeeze through them.</p><p>Include a nest or small animal hideout in the enclosure, which can be found at most pet stores. And add a hamster wheel with a solid surface for exercise. There also are all sorts of tubes, burrowing tunnels, and bridges that you can add to your hamster's habitat for enrichment. Moreover, make sure to include some wooden chew sticks or other chew toys made for hamsters, as this will help to wear down their continuously growing teeth.</p><p>Clean the enclosure at least once a week, replacing all the bedding and washing the surfaces with mild soap and water. Hamsters tend to pick a corner of their enclosure as their bathroom. So it's a good idea to scoop out and change the bedding in that corner every day to keep it sanitary.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Place 1 to 2 inches of bedding, such as aspen shavings or paper-based products, in the bottom of the enclosure. Hamsters may be hypersensitive to certain bedding materials such as cedar chips. It is important to steer clear of this substrate as it can cause dry skin, alopecia and secondary bacterial infections in affected animals.</p><h2>What Do Chinese Hamsters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, hamsters eat a varied diet of seeds, grains, nuts, vegetation, and insects. In captivity, you can feed your animal a commercial hamster food that's supplemented with vitamins and minerals. Follow the package instructions for how much to feed each day. Most owners put a day's worth of food in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure. You can do this at any point during the day, as hamsters like to graze throughout the day and night rather than eat designated meals.</p><p>Supplement the commercial hamster food with grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and timothy hay. Put these foods in a separate dish from your hamster's main diet. Supplemental foods should make up no more than 10% of the hamster's overall diet. Some options include pieces of apple, carrot, and oats. It's best to feed fresh foods only when your hamster is awake (often in the evening), so it can eat them before they start to spoil. Remove any fresh food from the enclosure within 24 hours, making sure to look for pieces of food that your hamster might have stashed in the bedding.</p><p>Finally, hamsters always need access to clean water. It's best to use a small animal water bottle attached to the side of the enclosure, which stays more sanitary than a water dish. But make sure your hamster is consistently drinking from the bottle before removing its water dish.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Hamsters are generally hardy animals, but they are prone to a few health problems.</p><p>Wet tail is a common illness in rodents, especially hamsters. Formally known as proliferative ileitis or regional enteritis, wet tail is diarrhea that typically arises from stress or unsanitary living conditions, which bring on a bacterial infection. Besides having diarrhea, your hamster might be lethargic and lose its appetite. Seek veterinary care immediately, as wet tail can be fatal if it's not treated. Plus, it can be contagious to any other hamsters in the enclosure. So if you do have other hamsters, put them in a separate cage and monitor them for symptoms. Thoroughly clean the primary enclosure, and don't reunite the hamsters until you're sure they're all symptom free.</p><p>Hamsters also are prone to lung and airway disorders that can quickly become serious. Symptoms include wheezing, nasal discharge, sneezing, and lethargy. This condition also requires prompt veterinary treatment.</p><p>Furthermore, when they don't have adequate chew toys, some hamsters might experience overgrown teeth, which can interfere with their ability to eat. You might notice your hamster's teeth look longer than normal, or you might just see it's not eating and losing weight. A veterinarian can trim the teeth if necessary and then advise you on proper dental maintenance.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Prior to acquiring a hamster, it's important to find a vet nearby who can treat this animal.</p><h2>Training Your Chinese Hamster </h2><p>Hand-taming is typically the extent of training with hamsters. Start gently handling your hamster from a young age, taking care never to squeeze it or jostle it. If it's becoming stressed, put it down somewhere it's secure and comfortable. Any time it spends in your hands should be a positive experience. You can even hand-feed it treats as you hold it to help with the taming process.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Providing an exercise wheel, along with a large enough enclosure, should be sufficient to keep your hamster physically fit and prevent obesity and other health issues. There are also exercise balls that you can put your hamster in to allow it to roam safely outside of its enclosure. Always monitor it when it's outside the enclosure.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Hamsters are fairly clean animals that groom themselves. They don't need baths. But if your hamster does happen to get some dirt or debris stuck in its fur, you can take a damp cloth to gently help clean it.</p>",1401

These foxes behave a lot like dogs and can be wonderful pets for those who can afford to buy and care for them (they tend to be very expensive). A curious, intelligent, and animated red fox requires attentive supervision to keep it out of trouble, but its cuddles and companionship may make the challenge worthwhile. Foxes can live in your home, like a dogs, but they will require an enclosure for unsupervised periods of time. They also need daily time outdoors for exercise. Foxes do not need a special diet; high quality dog food works well, with supplemental fruits and vegetables. Grooming foxes can be one of the most demanding aspects of ownership because their long coats require frequent brushing, especially during shedding seasons.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Russian red fox, Siberian fox</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:About 30 to 50 inches (head to tail); up to 30 pounds</p><p>Lifespan:Up to 14 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Russian Red Fox? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Before you buy or adopt a fox, it's important to know whether or not ownership is legal. As of 2022, most states ban foxes as pets. Sixteen states allow residents to own foxes, but each has a different set of regulations and requires unique permits. In North Carolina, for instance, residents can own a fox as long as they obtain an exhibition license and use the fox for learning programs in schools, libraries, or nature centers. Check with your state and local governments to determine the legality of owning a fox. Legal ownership ensures that you will be able to enjoy your pet without fear of confiscation and penalty, plus you will be able to secure proper veterinary care when your pet needs it. Even exotic pet veterinarians will not treat illegally owned animals.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Legally owning a domesticated Russian red fox does not pose ethical issues among people who understand that these are tame animals who have been bred to live with humans, not in the wild. Domesticated red foxes, specifically those of Russian descent, have been handled by humans for enough generations that they are content to live the domestic life of a pet.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>If owning a Russian red fox is legal in your area, then you may find this animal to be an enjoyable companion. These foxes are relatively well adapted to living alongside humans and behave similarly to domestic dogs, so their care is both familiar and manageable for people who are accustomed to owning dogs. All things considered, a Russian red fox makes a better pet than most other exotic species. However, foxes are intelligent, high-energy pets that need plenty of exercise and stimulation. You must be prepared to spend a lot of time with your fox to keep it occupied because boredom may lead to destructive behavior. A secure enclosure is a must when your fox is unsupervised since this animal naturally wants to urine-mark its territory.</p><h2>Russian Red Fox Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Although they share the same scientific name, Russian red foxes have been bred to favor genetic characteristics that make them different from wild foxes, essentially rendering them domesticated. They have lower adrenaline levels and so less agitated in captivity and are rarely aggressive with humans or inclined to bite. Tame foxes tend to be friendly, and some will even wag their tails, lick, or whimper with excitement like dogs.</p><p>Like their wild relatives, Russian red foxes are athletic, nimble, and have lots of energy. They can jump over 6 feet high, like to dig, and swim exceptionally well. They can also run up to 30 miles per hour. To remain happy and healthy, these intelligent creatures need plenty of playtime and environmental enrichment. A bored fox will become unhappy and potentially destructive, digging holes and chewing up household objects. Boredom may also lead to an increased drive to scent-mark your house and yard with urine. This is natural territorial behavior, but it will be more prominent if your fox is ignored for very long.</p><p>Domestic foxes will enjoy being a member of a human family, kids included, and they will get along fine with other household pets, particularly if they've grown up with these animals. Many foxes like being petted, held, and snuggled, so they are much more comforting companions than many exotic species.</p><h3>8 Things to Know Before Adopting a Pet Fox</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>A large enclosure (approximately 10 by 20 feet) makes an ample living area for a pet fox. The pen must be secured with a buried fence to both prevent your pet from digging out and predators from getting in. The fence must be a minimum of 7 feet high to contain these high-jumping animals. A roof is recommended for protection from the elements. The outdoor enclosure should also have a shelter or indoor area that has bedding, straw, or wood chips where your fox can nestle for a nap.</p><p>If you let your fox loose indoors, supervise it closely. Put away breakables and anything valuable (including car keys) because pet foxes have been known to grab small objects and hide them. Keep electrical cords out of reach, and consider using child locks on cabinet doors. If your house is toddler-proof, then it will be pretty safe for a fox to explore, too.</p><h2>What Do Russian Red Foxes Eat and Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, red foxes are omnivores that eat small rodents, birds, raccoons, insects, reptiles, and plant material, including fruit. A fox's diet in captivity can include grain-free dog food supplemented with fruit and vegetables. You can purchase high-quality dog food brands at pet stores. Feed your fox according to the package directions for its body weight, twice a day. Adjust amounts accordingly if your fox is losing or gaining too much weight. You can use standard dog dishes for food and water.</p><p>Fruit and vegetables should only account for a small portion of your fox's total diet. Usually, 1/4 cup a day works well as a supplement. They love strawberries, blueberries, apples, carrots, and mushrooms. Some red fox breeders also recommend raw meat, eggs, and taurine supplements. Check with your breeder and veterinarian to determine the best diet for your fox.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Pet foxes are susceptible to most canine diseases, including rabies and distemper. Research vaccines carefully and discuss them with your exotics veterinarian before you decide to vaccinate your pet fox. Some domestic foxes can suffer from reactions to conventional vaccines. However, you will need to accept the risk and consequences if your unvaccinated fox contracts a disease or bites a person. Depending on the laws of your state, your fox can be euthanized due to the risk of rabies in an unvaccinated animal. Foxes can also catch livestock diseases like bovine tuberculosis, and they can transmit certain illnesses to both humans and other pets.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Pet foxes need a lot of exercise. If you have a large yard, daily romps and ball-fetching games may keep your fox fit and happy. If you don't have a lot of outdoor space around your home, you will need to take your fox for walks if it accepts wearing a harness and leash. Your fox will be happiest if you can take it to an area where it can run, leap, and play off-leash a few times per week.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>As pets, foxes need occasional baths, just like long-haired dogs. Use a gentle shampoo formulated for dogs' skin and fur, and bathe your fox in a sink or tub. Only bathe your fox when it seems particularly dirty from outdoor play, or if its coat seems too oily. Over-bathing can dry out your fox's coat and skin, making it uncomfortable and more susceptible to irritation and infections.</p>>",1301

They are extremely high maintenance and fairly unpredictable, which is why most animal experts advise against keeping them as pets.</p><p>Many will damage your home and belongings as part of their daily antics, are difficult to truly tame, and are notorious biters when something bothers them. Plus, raccoons have dietary needs and health issues that can be difficult to manage. And as active animals, they need lots of space to roam. But if you have the knowledge and time to properly care for a raccoon, they can be fascinating and funny companions.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Raccoon</p> <p>Adult Size: 16 to 28 inches long, and 7 to 20 pounds on average</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Raccoon? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Before even considering a pet raccoon, you shouldbe aware of your local and state/provincial laws. Pet raccoons are illegal in many areas, and even where they are legal there are many laws surrounding their ownership. For instance, some states don't allow the importation of raccoons from other states.</p><p>In addition to checking the laws surrounding ownership, look carefully at regulations for raccoon owners. For example, what happens to your raccoon if it gets loose? What happens if it scratches or bites someone? In some areas, the laws are quite harsh regarding the treatment of wild animals kept as pets, and they might lead to your pet being euthanized if it's problematic in the community.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>There also are ethical considerations surrounding pet raccoons. Are you able to provide a proper and enriching environment for the animal? Can you feed it a healthy diet with the correct nutrition? Will you respect its boundaries as an animal that can't truly be domesticated? You must consider what's best for the animal over your interest in owning one. Experts recommend spending time around raccoons via wildlife rehabilitation or exotic veterinary practices to see what they're really like.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Be prepared to invest a lot of time and money in raccoon care. These active and mischievous animals need consistent supervision and lots of toys and other enrichment to keep them entertained. You also must determine whether there's a vet nearby who can treat raccoons, as well as who could watch your pet if you went out of town or were otherwise unable to care for it. We would also suggest calling your home insurer, to see if they will cover damage from a pet raccoon.</p><h2>Raccoon Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Raccoons are intelligent animals, known for their good memories and problem-solving abilities. Plus, these North American natives are nocturnal, meaning they're most active at night. And even when they're born in captivity or raised by humans, they typically retain their wild traits. That means it takes a lot of effort to care for them.</p><p>As pets, they don't do well in cages or even in small bedrooms. They need space to roam, climb, and explore to be happy. However, their sharp claws and teeth can easily destroy your property. If they don't have enough of their own toys to play with or they're just curious or bored you might find them chewing on your door frames, ripping up your bedsheets, knocking over decor items, and more. In addition, their ""masked bandit"" reputation doesn't just come from the dark markings around their eyes. Raccoons are quite adept at breaking through latches and other secured areas if their curiosity gets the best of them.</p><p>Raccoons will bond with their humans, especially when raised in captivity from a young age. And many do become quite cuddly or playful at times. However, they also are generally quick to bite even their favorite people when something annoys or scares them. Plus, they might attack other pets in your home, especially small animals, as they are predators in the wild.So they are best kept solo.</p><p>While they do make some vocalizations, raccoons are generally quiet animals. But life won't feel quiet with a pet raccoon. These animals require a lot of space, upkeep, and supervision.</p><h3>Could You Own a Pet Raccoon?</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>Some people who keep raccoons house them in a large dog crate when they aren't home to watch their pet. However, raccoons are too active to be content in a cage for several hours. So the majority of a pet raccoon's time should be spent roaming your house: playing, climbing on things, exploring, and being mischievous. That means your home must be raccoon-proofed. Raccoons are prone to chewing on cords, climbing on shelves, and knocking down valuables. So anything that might injure them or become damaged must be removed from their area.</p><p>If you have the space, it's ideal to provide a secure outdoor enclosure for your raccoon. This is a great option when you're busy or need to leave your home and want your pet to have a safe space to play. An outdoor pen should be as large as possible with walls and a ceiling that will contain your animal. Many people build their own pen from wood and screening. Inside, your raccoon should have access to food, water, shelter, and structures (e.g., large branches) for climbing and jumping. Include toys, such as balls and food puzzles, to keep your pet entertained.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>For the crate interior where your raccoon might temporarily spend time, an easily washable blanket or dog bed on the floor should keep the animal comfortable.</p><h2>What Do Raccoons Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Raccoons are omnivores, meaning they eat both meat and plants. Offer your pet a varied diet, including dog food, poultry, fish, eggs, insects, vegetables, and fruits. Treats, such as nuts and other fatty foods, should be offered sparingly to prevent obesity. A dish of clean water should be available at all times. Consult your veterinarian for the quantity and variety that is best for your animal, as this can vary based on age, size, and activity level.</p><p>Raccoons are messy eaters. They like to dunk their food in their water dish prior to consuming it. That means you'll need to regularly change their water and feed them in a location where it's easy to clean up. Most adult raccoons need two meals per day in the early morning and late evening, though follow your vet's advice on this. You can simply put their food in a bowl. But it's also ideal to take some of it to put in food puzzles or hide around their enclosure as a form of enrichment.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <p>Raccoons born and raised in captivity are less likely to develop many of these diseases. But it's still very important to take your pet for regular vet visits.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Finding a veterinarian for your exotic pet can be difficult, as not all vets have experience in raccoons. Prior to acquiring a raccoon as a pet, contact exotic veterinarians in your area to find one who specializes in this animal and is willing to take one on as a patient.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Captive raccoons can be prone to obesity if they aren't given enough space to roam. Ideally, they should be allowed to move freely around your living area and provided with branches, shelves, and other items to climb for exercise. Some also enjoy playing with toys like balls.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Raccoons tend to go through a heavy shedding period at least once a year, as well as in times of stress. Gently brushing them during this time can help to prevent the loose fur from matting.</p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>Raccoons are generally very clean animals and will groom themselves much like cats do. They only require occasional baths with a mild shampoo. Consult your vet for the best bathing frequency to avoid irritating their skin. Also, as pet raccoons won't be in their natural environment that wears down their nails, they'll likely need regular nail trims. An experienced vet should be able to do this for you.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>On average, raccoons reach around 16 to 28 inches long, and they weigh between 7 and 20 pounds.They'll reach their full size between 4 months and 1 year old.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>On a monthly basis, your main essential cost for a raccoon will be its healthy, varied diet. You also might need to spend money on new toys for mental and physical enrichment. Plan to spend between $30 and $50 per month on average, also budgeting for at least an annual veterinary checkup and any emergency medical care.</p><h2>Training Your Raccoon </h2><p>Thanks to their intelligence, most pet raccoons are able to learn their name and even a few commands, such as ""sit"" and ""shake.""</p><h3>Potty Training </h3><p>Some raccoons can be trained to use a litter box. But they are rather stubborn and selective about when they want to obey.Litter training them is similar to how one would teach a cat to use a litter box.<br/></p>",1457
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/about-fennec-foxes-as-pets-1236778,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep Fennec Fox (Desert Fox) as a Pet? </h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep Fennec Fox (Desert Fox) as a Pet? </h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The fennec fox, also known as the desert fox, is a petite animal that's native to the Sahara desert and other parts of North Africa. Although it's not common, sometimes these tiny foxes with oversized ears are kept as pets. Fennec foxes behave a bit like active, playful little dogs. However, it's important to remember these are still animals with wild instincts, even if they were bred in captivity.</p><p>As pets, they usually aren't very cuddly with people, and because they are prey animals in the wild, they can be rather skittish and startled easily. Plus, fennec foxes are mostly nocturnal, meaning they're more active at night. It can be especially difficult to manage their high energy level during the hours when most people are sleeping. Thus, it's not easy to care for a pet fennec fox.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Fennec fox, desert fox</p> <p>ADULT SIZE: 9 to 16 inches long, weighing 1.5 to 3.5 pounds</p><p>LIFESPAN: Up to 11 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Fennec Fox? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Laws about owning a fennec fox vary widely depending on the jurisdiction. Most parts of the United States have some regulations regarding fennecs from outright bans to simply requiring a permit. Plus, some local laws might conflict with state laws, so be sure to check the regulations for exactly where you live.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>It is vital that you acquire your fennec from a reputable breeder or rescue organization. While the odds are slim that you'll find a seller of wild-caught fennecs in the United States, it's still important to ensure your fennec was captive-bred. These animals generally adapt to life in captivity much better than an animal that previously lived in the wild.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>While unquestionably cute, fennec foxes are indeed noisy, energetic creatures. While they can adjust to a life with humans, they are a good deal of work for their owners who must commit to giving these big-eared friends the correct types of exercise, diet, and veterinary care.</p><h2>Fennec Fox Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Although fennecs typically live in groups in the wild, they tend to be somewhat independent as pets. They might enjoy playing with their humans at times, such as an energetic game of fetch. But then there will be other times when they prefer to play alone. In addition, the majority of pet fennecs will allow people they know to pick them up, but most don't seem to enjoy handling overall.</p><p>Fennecs are cautious by nature, and they are quick to flee if something frightens them. While most would rather choose flight over fight, they will bite if something truly angers them. Some fennecs, especially unneutered males, will also mark their territory with urine including the inside of your home.</p><p>These animals make a variety of vocalizations to express their moods, and some can be very loud. They're certainly not a good fit for someone who prefers a quiet pet. Some fennecs will get along with other household pets, especially dogs and cats around their size. Introduction at a young age will help them coexist more peacefully with other animals, as well as bond with their human family members.</p><p>Expect to spend a lot of time and effort keeping your fennec exercised. They are quick, active, and agile animals. Fortunately, many fennecs will adapt to their human's schedule, rather than remaining nocturnal. Fennecs can be trained to walk on a leash, which helps to get some of their energy out each day.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>As desert animals, fennecs require temperatures of at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in an appropriate climate, an outdoor enclosure that's as large as possible is ideal to give your fennec some exercise. Many people make their own outdoor pens out of wood and wire screening. The pen must be designed to prevent your fennec from digging under or climbing over the walls, both of which these foxes are quite good at doing. (They can dig holes 20 feet deep!) To stop your fox from digging under the walls, build the pen over pavers, concrete, or wood decking, preferably with a layer of sand or dirt over the top for a more natural environment. You will need to either angle the fencing in at the top, or cover the whole enclosure with screening.</p><p>While indoors, your fennec will likely jump on furniture and could potentially knock over decorations and other items as it plays. So it's important to put away breakables and anything that might injure your animal. Fennecs generally should be kenneled when you're not able to supervise them simply because they will get into . If you don't have a suitable outdoor pen, use a dog crate indoors.</p><p>Furthermore, some fennecs can be trained to use a litter box indoors. A covered box works best due to its tendency to dig. (A lot of litter will fly out of the box otherwise.) The training process involves taking the fox frequently to the litter box and giving lots of treats when it succeeds in using the box. You can use the same method to train the fox to relieve itself outdoors. Never punish an animal for accidents in the house.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Keep the floor of your fennec's crate dust-free, with lots of ventilation and low humidity. You can line the floor with old newspaper, making it easy to clean and replace.</p><h2>What do Fennec Foxes Eat and Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, fennec foxes are omnivores that eat a varied diet of meat and plants, including rodents, birds, insects, and fruit. An optimal diet for a pet fennec fox is a commercial wild canid diet, which is what many zoos feed them. But most owners feed their fennecs a mix of dog food, cat food, vegetables, and fruit. It's especially important to make sure a fennec's diet has an adequate amount of taurine, an amino acid that's key for many metabolic processes in the body.Consult your veterinarian on the right quantity and variety for your fox, as this can vary depending on age, size, and activity level.</p><p>Most owners feed meals twice a day, though you should follow your vet's recommendations on this. You can simply put the food in a bowl for your fox, or you can hide some in a treat puzzle to give your pet some mental enrichment. Also, provide a bowl of clean water at all times.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Before you even acquire a fennec fox, you must make sure there is an exotic veterinarian near you who will treat such an animal. Fennecs need preventative care similar to dogs. They should be routinely vaccinated for rabies, canine distemper virus, parvovirus, and adenovirus. Your vet should be able to recommend the correct course of vaccines. A yearly wellness exam is recommended, and your vet will advise you on deworming, heartworm prevention, andflea control if necessary.</p><p>Common health problems in fennecs are similar to what many dogs experience. They are prone to kidney, liver, and heart disease, especially if their diet is poor. Symptoms of these diseases include lethargy and a lack of appetite. They also can develop skin infections and mites, as well as intestinal parasites. Skin infections can present with a lot of itching while intestinal parasites can cause abnormal feces, weight loss, and poor appetite.</p>",1209
7,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kinkajous-as-pets-1237227,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Kinkajou as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Kinkajou as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Also known as honey bears, kinkajous are cat-sized rainforest mammals with long tails. They are related to raccoons and coatis. Kinkajous are generally friendly, playful, and curious when raised in captivity. But, while a kinkajou can make a unique pet for the right person, these animals are also high-maintenance. They are easy to startle and might become aggressive with their owners. Plus, they can be difficult to house because they require lots of room for exercise. Kinkajous need a varied diet that mimics what they would eat in the wild. All things considered, the kinkajou requires a knowledgeable and committed owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Kinkajou, honey bear</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:31 to 44 inches from head to tail; up to 10 pounds</p><p>Lifespan:20 to 25 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Kinkajou? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Kinkajous are legal in several states, but it's still important to know your local ordinances, which can differ from state law. Many counties and cities require permits to keep a kinkajou. Rental properties or homeowners' associations often have restrictions for exotic pets as well.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Ethically speaking, it is critical to source a captive-bred kinkajou. Habitat destruction and the illegal pet trade in their native regions have caused wild populations to decline. Buying a wild kinkajou would contribute to this species' increasingly vulnerable conservation status. It is also a challenge to provide truly ethical care for an animal whose natural habitat is so different from a human household. Mimicking the kinkajou's native environment would be a costly and laborious undertaking.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Kinkajous may be a unique and interesting animal to own, but that doesn't necessarily mean they are great pets. They are naturally nocturnal, so waking them to interact during the day may disturb them physically and emotionally. An agitated or startled kinkajou may be more inclined to bite. In addition, kinkajous make loud noises often at night making them problematic pets for people who have neighbors or enjoy an undisturbed night's sleep</p><h2>Kinkajou Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>When raised in captivity from a young age, kinkajouscan be friendly with humans, but they retain a wildness that makes their behavior unpredictable.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Kinkajous have extremely sharp teeth, and although they are generally mild-mannered animals, they will bite if alarmed or irritated. They may be easily startled and are likely to bite if they feel threatened. For this reason, it's best to keep them separated from children or any other pets in the household.</p><p>Unlike dogs and cats, which provide cuddly and animated companionship for humans, kinkajous' wild genes make them less interested in being in the company of people. They prefer to forage in the rainforest at night, often by themselves, and sleep during the day.</p><p>Wild kinkajous indulge in fruit and honey while climbing trees, which is how they got their ""honey bear"" nickname. These are somewhat social animals, spending some time alone and some time in groups grooming, sleeping, and playing together.</p><p>Kinkajous can be noisy. They have a variety of vocalizations, including a ""barking"" noise like a yelping dog and a shrill shriek that can be very loud.</p><p>As pets, kinkajous generally are active and curious, and they like to get into things, requiring a lot of effort to keep them entertained. Their mischievousness can also lead to messiness. They like to toss their food around, and house-training them isn't typically successful. Instead, they often pick a few places around the house to use as their bathroom, so you might be able to put a pan or paper in those spots to collect the waste.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Kinkajous need as large an enclosure as possible. At a minimum, it should be 4 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 6 feet tall. Ideally, though, owners would implement zoo standards, which would be 10 to 12 feet of complex, vertical space. Some large macaw enclosures can work well for kinkajous. Provide several branches, ledges, shelves, and ropes for climbing within the enclosure.You also can include some parrot toys, such as wooden ladders, rope swings, and hanging ropes with pieces of wood on them. Avoid anything with a chain, as this can injure a kinkajou's paws.</p><p>Include a hammock or nest box in the enclosure where your animal can go to feel safe and rest. Fleece is a good material for a hammock, and you can fashion a nest box out of wood or a small plastic storage container lined with fleece. Attach the box to the side of the enclosure so that it is suspended above the floor since kinkajous sleep in trees.</p><p>Kinkajous are generally fine with the room temperature of a home. Just make sure the temperature stays above 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, humidity levels aren't specifically determined for this species but the Association of Zoos and Aquariums recommends keeping it between 30 and 70 percent.</p><p>These animals also can benefit from an outdoor enclosure for more environmental enrichment. Set it up similarly to the indoor enclosure, but make sure your kinkajou always has access to shade. Also, always monitor your animal when it's outdoors to avoid predators or inclement weather.</p><h2>What Do Kinkajous Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Kinkajous primarily feed on fruits, nectar, and honey in the wild. They will sometimes eat insects, eggs, frogs, and other plants and blossoms.</p><p>In captivity, they can be fed commercial omnivore foods, such as raccoon food, which will form a nutritious base to their diet with many vitamins and minerals. They also enjoy a variety of fruits such as bananas, papayas, mangoes, melons, kiwis, grapes, pineapples, and pomegranates. In addition, they can have some seasonal vegetables and a bit of protein, such as cooked chicken or eggs. Experts recommend avoiding strawberries, citrus fruits, avocados, broccoli, and onions, along with dairy, chocolate, and caffeine.</p><p>Heavy ceramic food bowls or bowls that can be securely attached to the side of the enclosure work well for feeding since the kinkajou can't easily spill them. In an ideal environment, owners should stimulate how kinkajous would typically find food in the wild using terminal branch feeding (placing food throughout the ends of ropes, branches, or ladders). Fresh water also should be provided at all times. However, water in a bowl is likely to be dumped or dirtied, so a water bottle with a sipper tube that attaches to the enclosure wall is recommended. Make sure your kinkajou figures out how to drink from the sipper tube before removing its water bowl.</p><p>Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate quantity and variety to feed your animal, as this varies with age, size, and activity level. It's typically best to feed your kinkajou in the evening when it's waking up and looking for food, but ask your vet for the ideal feeding schedule.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>An exotic animal veterinarian who specializes in kinkajous can be difficult to find, but it's very important to locate the right doctor before purchasing your pet. You may end up traveling out of state to find a clinic that will see your pet and should be prepared to know where to go if your kinkajou gets sick.</p><p>While these are generally healthy animals, an annual wellness exam is still ideal. Your vet will likely recommend some vaccinations, including those for rabies and distemper, as well as deworming. In addition, kinkajous should be neutered or spayed at about 6 months old to help prevent aggression due to hormones.</p><p>Some kinkajous are prone to dental disease due to the amount of sugar in their diet. Signs of this include a lack of appetite, a bad smell coming from the animal's mouth, and weight loss. If this is the case, consult your vet immediately; they should be able to advise you on appropriate dental hygiene for your pet.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Most owners find it best to confine kinkajous whenever they're not able to supervise the animal. (The ideal kinkajou owner would have a similar nocturnal lifestyle as their pet, though that's not an option for many people.) But confinement doesn't allow a kinkajou to get enough exercise, even in the best enclosure, so you must allow your kinkajou to play and exercise out of its enclosure for at least a few hours each day for health, socialization, and to prevent boredom. Kinkajou-proof the area of your home where you let it play as you would for a toddler hide power cords, cover outlets, and remove breakable or sharp objects.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>In the wild, kinkajous groom one another with their tongues. In captivity, a single pet kinkajou may need an occasional warm sink or tub bath to remove some of the natural oil that can accumulate in the animal's fur. Ideally, begin acclimating your kinkajou to bathing as a baby so that it becomes a familiar experience. Fill a sink or tub with a few inches of warm water, turn off the tap, and gently settle your pet into the water. Go slowly to avoid startling the kinkajou. Use a mild pet soap to wash the fur, then rinse thoroughly. Make sure to avoid getting soap or water in the eyes or ears.</p>",1492

Their bodies are similar to squirrels with gray fur and black markings. They also have a gliding membrane a thin, skin-like structure that extends from the front to back limbs on each side, almost like wings that helps them travel among trees.</p><p>Sugar gliders make for playful, curious, and social pets. But they do require frequent handling to keep them tame, along with ample space for exercise. Plus, they have a very particular diet. These animals are not for beginner pet owners, and you should put considerable effort into educating yourself about the species before acquiring a sugar glider. Then, expect to spend multiple hours per day tending to them.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAME: Sugar glider</p> <p>ADULT SIZE: 5 to 8 inches long (tail adds another 6-8 inches); weighs between 2 and 5 ounces</p><p>LIFESPAN: 10 to 15 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Sugar Glider? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Sugar gliders are illegal in several states, including Alaska, Hawaii, and California. But even if your state allows them, make sure they are legal at the local level. And in some locations, they require permits to keep. The best way to determine whether it's legal for you to own a sugar glider is to go to the UDSA's APHIS website and look up the laws in your locality.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Many experts believe that sugar gliders, being highly social animals that need lots of activities, a large living space, and plenty of socializing, are not smart pets to have because they feel the animals will suffer and possibly experience depression if their needs are not well met.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Can you provide the right environment, do you have the space to provide a large enough enclosure? Do you have the finances and time available to commit to adopting sugar gliders so yours is never alone? Are you near enough to a veterinarian with expertise in these exotic marsupials, so you can find yours the right medical care? These are all things to think about before you purchase your pet.</p><h2>Sugar Glider Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Many people find pet sugar gliders to be endearing and entertaining. They are quick, love to climb, and will glide from place to place if their space allows it. Plus, as nocturnal animals (meaning they're most active at night), they like to cuddle up in a cozy nest during the day to sleep.</p><p>Because they are social animals, it's usually ideal to have more than one sugar glider, one male and at least one female. However, they need to be kept away from pets of other species in the household like cats and dogs as they might injure one another.</p><p>Regular human interaction is very important if you want your glider to bond with you. Allowing a sugar glider to ride in your shirt pocket or in a pouch that hangs around your neck is an easy way to interact with it throughout the day. If your glider isn't used to being handled, it can take some time for it to become cuddly with you. Sugar gliders generally are not aggressive pets, but they will bite if they feel threatened or frightened. It's key to be very patient and gentle when handling them.</p><p>Furthermore, sugar gliders are rather vocal pets and have various noises to tell you when they're upset, frightened, hungry, and more. They typically will give an audible warning when they are angry before attempting to bite. You might hear this sound if you wake a sleeping glider.</p><h3>Watch Now: How are Sugar Gliders as Pets?</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>An enclosure that's 36 inches wide by 24 inches deep by 36 inches high is a good size for a pair of sugar gliders. Bigger is always better, and the height is more valuable than the floor space due to the climbing and gliding activities of these little marsupials.</p><p>Thecagewire spacing should be no more than a half-inch wide, and the bars should be horizontal to facilitate climbing. The interior of the cage should contain lots of toys and a exercise wheel (so the glider's tail doesn't get caught). Branches, ropes, and ladders will also provide opportunities for climbing, play, and exercise.Place a nest box near the top of the enclosure as a spot where your glider can go to feel safe and sleep.</p><p>The latch on the cage door should be very secure, as gliders are clever and have been known to learn how to open simple latches.</p><p>Keep the cage away from direct sunlight and drafts, and maintain a room temperature between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Line the bottom of the sugar glider's cage with newspaper or other recycled paper product that is non-toxic if ingested. Avoid cedar shavings, which have a strong scent that can cause respiratory irritation in small animals. Replace the paper and clean surfaces and toys in the cage with soap and water at least once a week. Most illnesses that affect sugar gliders are due to unsanitary living conditions.</p><h2>What Do Sugar Gliders Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Sugar gliders have fairly strictdietary requirements. In the wild, a sugar glider's diet includes nectar and sap from trees. But sugar gliders are omnivorous, meaning they eat plants and animals. In addition to the nectar and sap, they also consume fruit, insects, and even small birds or rodents.</p><p>For pet sugar gliders, variations of the homemade Bourbon's Modified Leadbeater (BML) diet are very popular. Honey, calcium powder, and baby cereal are often used in these recipes to provide proper nutrition to your glider. Fresh fruits and vegetables should be offeredin moderation, less than 10 percent of the total diet, because many lack essential vitamins, minerals, and protein and contain mostly water. Many owners put out meals in small food bowls in the morning and at night. But some sugar gliders tend to graze, rather than eat a full meal at once. So don't be concerned if you see some food leftover, but do discard leftovers prior to the next meal to prevent them from spoiling.</p><p>Consult your veterinarian on the best quantity to feed your glider, as this can vary based on age, size, and activity level. And always keep a water dish or bottle in the cage, which should be refreshed at least daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Sugar gliders are very susceptible to stress if awakened and taken out of their cages in daytime hours. They have even been known to self-mutilate (bite and scratch themselves) under stressful conditions. Housing sugar gliders that don't get along or providing too small of an enclosure are two major stressors for these small, sensitive creatures. If you notice any signs of self-mutilation, such as missing patches of fur, consult your vet immediately. They can help to determine the issue and suggest lifestyle modifications.</p><p>Sugar gliders also are prone to some bacterial and parasitic infections. For instance, giardia, which is a protozoan parasite, can cause dehydration, lethargy, and weight loss. Most bacterial and parasitic infections occur due to under-washed fruits and vegetables, so thoroughly clean any foods you feed to your sugar glider.</p><p>Moreover, many issues arise in sugar gliders due to malnutrition. A malnourished glider might be thin, lethargic, and have pale gums. Low calcium and blood sugar are commonly the culprits. This often results in anemia and can turn into more serious health issues, such as kidney, liver, and metabolic bone disease (which can cause bone fractures).</p><p>Furthermore, dental disease is quite common in sugar gliders because of their sugary diet. If your glider is having tooth problems, you might notice it is eating less or has a bad smell coming from its mouth. A teeth cleaning with your veterinarian will likely be in order, and your vet can advise you on oral hygiene tips.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Sugar gliders are very active animals, that's one of the reasons they need such a large enclosure. They need branches and ropes and anything else safe for them to climb, including exercise wheels and balls.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Sugar gliders shed minimally, if at all. Their fur is nothing you need to worry about unless it starts to look unkempt, at which point a visit to the vet would be in order.</p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>Sugar gliders are excellent groomers, and you will not need to bathe yours. They literally bathe themselves by spitting into their hands.</p>",1393
9,https://www.thesprucepets.com/capybara-pet-4101211,Small Pets > Exotic Pets,<h1>Should You Keep a Capybara as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Capybara as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Capybaras are affectionately called giant guinea pigs, but they are not as simple to care for as their smaller cousins. Smart, sociable animals, capybaras are the largest rodents in the world, weighing up to 170 pounds. They are relatively pleasant household pets that fare best in pairs or groups, so you must get more than one. Since they are so large, they require plenty of space and an accessible pool of water.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAME:Capybara</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</p><p>ADULT SIZE:3 to 4 feet tall, weighing up to 170 pounds</p><p>LIFESPAN:8 to 12 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Capybara? </h2><h2>Legality </h2><p>Depending on where you live, it may be illegal to own a capybara. Some vicinities may require a permit or health certificate. For some examples, capybaras are banned as pets in California and Georgia. However, they are legal to possess in Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York. Even if a state allows it, some cities may not. Capybaras are considered illegal pets in the five boroughs of New York City. Before you buy one, contact your local city government or humane society to find out if it is legal to own a capybara where you live.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Owning a capybara or two is a huge expense and an even bigger commitment. These are enormous animals, more about 170 pounds each, times two. Capybaras really need to live in the kind of environment provided by professional zoos.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Capybaras are large, expensive pets that need a great deal of living space which includes aquatic space. They are social creatures that do best in pairs, so you would need to purchase and house a pair of them, either two females or a male and a female; two males, even if they're neutered, may be aggressive toward each other. Unless you're able to carve out this kind of living situation, a capybara is not for you.</p><h2>Capybara Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Hand-reared capybaras are typically quite tame, but if you are getting an adult capybara as a pet, you will have to be patient until it warms up to you. Capybaras are not prone to biting humans. However, if they feel threatened or provoked, they will use their giant teeth to defend themselves and may bite. In general, capybaras tend to be nervous and shy.</p><p>Scent glands in males are located on the top of their snouts and are used to mark their territory. Females also have these glands, but they are not as visible. Both sexes also use their anal glands for marking. Capybaras are very vocal with each other.</p><p>In the wilds of Central and South America, they are found in large groups anywhere there is standing water since they have dry skin that needs constant hydration. Capybaras have webbed feet, making them excellent swimmers. They can hold their breath for about five minutes underwater.</p><p>Capybaras like areas with plenty of grasses, which they eat and use to hide from predators. Similar to pigs, these big rodents may cover themselves in mud to help regulate their body temperature and prevent sunburn since they have thin fur and don't have many sweat glands.</p><p>Just like guinea pigs, capybaras are highly social and communicate with each other using a variety of sounds. They use purrs, barks, grunts, whistles, squeals, coughs, and more. A capybara housed alone, unable to communicate with anyone, can become stressed out and depressed. You can imitate these sounds to reassure your capybara. But the best way to ensure your pet's happiness is to make sure they have at least one friend to talk to, groom, and swim with.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Unique Capybara</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>Capybaras need a marshy environment, similar to their native habitat: capybaras come from the jungles of South America.</p><p>Since capybaras should not be kept solitary, you will need to make sure you have plenty of space for your rodent family. You will need a large fenced-in area, roughly 12 feet by 20 feet per pair, as well as a safe enclosure indoors or covered at night. The outside fence should be at least 4 feet high. Make sure that there are no gaps that your pet can squeeze through.</p><p>Scatter items that are safe for your capybara to chew on, such as untreated wood or large dog toys that can be picked up or floated in the water.</p><p>Capybaras are diurnal; they need daily exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. They can handle a vast gradient in temperatures from 45 degrees Fahrenheit up to 100; however, they require a warmer area to retreat to on cold days and a watering hole for cooling off when it is sweltering. If the seasonal temperatures get too cold where you live, and they must retreat indoors for the season, make sure you provide UVB lighting indoors for at least 12 hours per day. If their enclosure drops cooler than 45 degrees Fahrenheit, provide heat lamps to warm up the area. If you live in a subtropical or tropical zone, then they should be able to live outdoors most, if not all, the time.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The best substrates for your capybara are hay and straw, sterilized soil, or grass; foundations that can be replaced easily, to keep the cage clean and odor-free.</p><h2>What Do Capybaras Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Capybaras only eat about three to six plant species in the wild. The most common ingredient in a pet capybaras diet should be high-quality grass hay offered in piles or bales. Orchard hay and Timothy hay are both readily available from pet stores and large animal feed stores.</p><p>This hay will not only provide the necessary nutrients and roughage a large rodent needs but will also help keep a capybara's teeth at an appropriate length. Like other rodents, capybara teeth continuously grow throughout their lives. Hay, grass, wood, and other course objects help to file down their teeth. If their teeth do not file down, they will develop an overbite, which can lead to mouth disfigurement and pain while eating. If that happens, they will require the care of a specialized exotics veterinarian.</p><p>Also, capybaras should be fed guinea pig pellets with vitamin C in a feeding bowl every day.Like guinea pigs and humans, capybaras do not produce enough vitamin C naturally in their bodies. These pellets help prevent scurvy, a vitamin C deficiency. You can give vegetable treats, like carrots, apples, or yams, but only sparingly. Too much sugar even natural sugar is addicting. You do not want your capybaras to become selective eaters.</p><p>Spread hay around the enclosure; this will help recreate natural grazing. You can allow your capybaras to graze on your grass as long as you are 100 percent certain that there are no toxic weeds, fertilizers, or insecticides.</p><p>Monitor its droppings. Normal poop looks olive-shaped. If it gets too loose, your pets may be getting too much sugar or moisture. It may be a sign they need more hay and roughage and fewer treats.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Aside from vitamin C deficiency, they are relatively hardy creatures. Like most rodents, capybaras are prone to respiratory infections and infestations with mites or lice in their fur. To prevent these issues, keep the pen clean. If your capybara appears listless or stops eating, it may have a digestive problem. Now would be a good time to call your exotics veterinarian to make sure your capybaras stay in good health.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As a semi-aquatic species, capybaras need the ability to loll in the water and swim sometimes. Provide a pen that will allow your capybaras to move around freely with a pool of water that allows for swimming and wading (over 3 feet deep). The pool and a shaded area should be accessible at all times.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Capybaras are not big shedders, just a few hairs at a time. Nothing to worry about if you're going to adopt one.</p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>Grooming is a calming icebreaker among capybaras. Offer your new capybara some food and gently comb them; it can be a relaxing, bonding experience.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Capybaras grow to be about 3 to 4 feet tall, and adults weigh up to 170 pounds.</p><h2>Training Your Capybara </h2><h2>House Training </h2><p>Capybaras are intelligent, social animals that can be taught to be house-trained. You can try both wet and dry pans. You'll have the most success training a capybara when it's young. Just be aware, these giant rodents have a habit of eating their own waste. We know, it's gross. But they are indeed wild animals and do in fact get nutrients this way.</p><h3>Leash Training </h3><p>Some people are able to train their capys to wash on a lead, leash, or harness. If you join an online capybara community, you're sure to get loads of advice on how to do this.</p>",1449

They will form a close bond with other rabbits and even with people. As long as you know what to expect from pet rabbits, they have the potential to be wonderful pets. The ideal owner for a pet rabbit is an individual or family with the time and space to dedicate to an active pet that enjoys cuddling and playing and requires a moderate amount of maintenance. Rabbits come in many different breeds that range in appearance, including lionhead, mini lop, mini rex, rex, lop, Dutch, English spot, and hotot.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Rabbit</p> <p>Adult Size: 8 to 20 inches long on average, weighing 2 to 20 pounds (varies by breed)</p><p>Lifespan: 8 years on average (varies by breed)</p><h2>Rabbit Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Rabbits are social creatures. And with gentle handling, they are generally quite tame, playful, and entertaining to watch. Many can even learn to respond to their name and come when called.</p><p>Rabbits often form close bonds with their owners and like to be around them. Some rabbits are OK with being picked up. But more often they prefer their feet on the ground and enjoy cuddling up next to their owners for petting. They don't tend to bite, but some might scratch if they feel they're being improperly handled. Thus, pet rabbits typically aren't a good match for children who don't understand gentle handling.</p><p>It is ideal to keep more than one rabbit to meet their social needs. Members of the opposite sex can be kept together as long as they are spayed and neutered. Moreover, some rabbits can get along with other household pets, including well-mannered dogs and cats. But they should never be around other animals that might view them as prey.</p><p>Rabbits are generally quiet pets, and their care is fairly straightforward with daily feedings and regular cleanings. Daily exercise outside of their cage also is a necessity. And they need to chew. So lots of safe chew toys should be provided, and any spaces where the rabbit is allowed to roam must be carefully rabbit-proofed. A rabbit that is deprived of toys and socialization often becomes destructive.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Rabbit breeds range widely in size, stretching around 8 to 20 inches long. There are small breeds that only weigh a couple pounds, as well as large breeds that can be 20 pounds or more.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Rabbits are prey animals, which means housing your rabbit outdoors is generally not a good idea; keep your rabbit enclosure indoors.</p><p>When not being directly supervised, your rabbit should be kept in an enclosure that's at least 2 feet by 3 feet for one medium-size rabbit. Multiple rabbits housed together need more space. The height of the enclosure should be greater than the height of your rabbit when it fully stretches up on its hind legs. Because rabbits have tender feet, avoid wire-bottom cages; a better choice is a plastic-bottom dog crate.</p> <p>With all the items in the enclosure, make sure there's still enough room for your rabbit to fully stretch out with its back legs extended.</p><p>Many pet rabbits are allowed to roam around the house when their owners are around. If you choose to allow this, be very careful to rabbit-proof your home. Rabbits love to chew, and dangerous electrical cords are at just the right height for them to find and munch on.</p><p>If you'd rather not give your rabbit run of the house, you can provide it with an exercise pen. Pens designed for puppies are ideal. They provide room to move without giving your bunny the option of exploring potentially dangerous spaces. Many owners even use exercise pens as their rabbit's primary enclosure.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Regardless of what type of enclosure you choose for your rabbit, make sure the floor is nonslip. Some owners put washable carpeting on the enclosure floor to give the rabbit some cushion. You also can put down some straw for your rabbit to make a cozy nest. Use dye-free paper litter in the litter box; never use clumping litter. Plan to clean the litter box at least every other day, and wipe down the whole enclosure with mild soap and water weekly.</p><h2>What Do Rabbits Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Rabbits are herbivores, and their daily diet should consist mostly of hay. Feed an unlimited amount of grass hay each day, such as timothy, oat hay, or orchard grass; avoid alfalfa hay. You can simply pile the hay in the enclosure, or put it in a special feeder called a hopper. Just make sure there's always some available.</p><p>Supplement the hay with a variety of green leafy vegetables. Good choices include lettuces (except iceberg), herbs, watercress, carrot tops, cucumbers, and sprouts.Provide a more limited supply of other vegetables and fruits. Check with your vet on the quantity to feed and to be sure all items you offer are rabbit-safe. You can offer fresh foods once or twice a day, simply placing them in the enclosure near your rabbit. Remove any uneaten fresh food after a few hours to prevent spoilage.</p><p>You also can offer a limited amount of commercial rabbit pellets. However, overfeeding pellets can cause digestive issues and obesity. So be sure to discuss the feeding amount with your vet. Place a day's worth of pellets in a ceramic bowl. Discard any leftover pellets before feeding the next day's portion.</p><p>Finally, rabbits always should have access to fresh water. Use either a ceramic dish or water bottle attached to the side of the enclosure (make sure your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle), refreshing the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <p>Some rabbits also might experience overgrown teeth. Rabbit teeth continuously grow and need to be worn down via their diet and chew toys. Overgrown teeth can make it difficult for a rabbit to eat and drink and typically must be trimmed by a vet.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians accept rabbits as patients. So before acquiring a pet rabbit, make sure there is a vet near you who will be able to treat it.</p><h2>Training Your Rabbit </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Most rabbits take well to litter box training, as rabbits are fairly clean animals that like to pick spots to be their toilet. Place a litter box that your rabbit can easily hop in and out of inside the rabbit's enclosure where it's already been relieving itself. Also make sure your rabbit always has access to a box when it's outside its enclosure. It's best to limit its out-of-cage area (such as to a puppy play pen) until the rabbit has learned to use a litter box. That way, it shouldn't ever be far from a box when it has to relieve itself.</p><p>Besides the litter, put a handful of hay in the box, which should entice your rabbit to go in. Replace the hay daily to keep it sanitary, and replace the litter every couple of days. If the box becomes too dirty, the rabbit is likely not to want to use it. Furthermore, rabbits that aren't spayed or neutered are more likely to relieve themselves outside of the litter box as a way to mark their territory.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Getting several hours of exercise per day is essential to keep a rabbit happy and to prevent health issues, such as obesity.Let your rabbit out of its enclosure as much as possible to allow it to roam in a safe area, as long as you're able to supervise. A minimum of four hours outside of the enclosure per day is ideal. To encourage activity, offer toys such as a tunnel for exploration or a treat ball.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Rabbits do groom themselves, but brushing helps to remove loose fur and prevent hairballs. Brush short-hair rabbits roughly once a week. Long-hair rabbits often need brushing daily to prevent tangles and mats.</p><p>Baths are generally not necessary, though you might need to spot clean a dirty part of your rabbit's coat by gently rubbing it with a damp cloth.</p><p>Most rabbits also need nail trims, as they don't naturally wear down their nails enough in their indoor environment. Your vet can show you how to properly trim nails at home.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Rabbits may be small, but they are relatively expensive animals. On a monthly basis, your primary costs will be for food and litter. Expect to spend between $40 and $60 on average, depending on how many rabbits you have and which varieties you choose. Plus, you'll need to replace worn toysespecially chew toyson a regular basis at a cost of around $10 to $20. Finally, don't forget to budget for routine veterinary checkups and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Rabbit as a Pet </h2><p>Rabbits are quiet pets that don't take up a great deal of space. They also can be quite social, playful, and engaged with their owners. However, their upkeep is relatively expensive. And they need a lot of interaction, which often means keeping a second rabbit.</p>",1484

Also, don't place it in a loud, high-traffic area. But keep it somewhere nearby, as rabbits like to be close to their human families.</p><p>Wherever you allow your rabbit to roam outside of its enclosure, make sure the area is totally rabbit-proofed. Rabbits love to chew and will bite on electrical cords and other potential hazards they can reach.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The floor of your rabbit enclosure must be nonslip. Many owners put down washable rugs to add softness and make cleanup easy. You also can offer a pile of straw for your rabbit to nest in, as well as a soft blanket or towel (making sure your rabbit can't get tangled or snagged in the material). Use dye-free paper litter in the litter box.</p><p>Remove waste from the cage floor and litter box daily. Also, wash the food and water dishes daily. And once a week, scrub down everything in the enclosure with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Mini Rex Rabbits Eat & Drink? </h2><p>The majority of your rabbit's diet should be fresh grass hay, such as timothy or oat hay. Provide an unlimited amount of hay daily, always making sure some is available to the rabbit. You can either pile the hay in the enclosure or use a special feeder called a hopper.</p><p>To supplement the hay, offer fresh greens every day. Options include lettuces, herbs, radish tops, and carrot tops. Other fruits and veggies, such as carrots, can be given in smaller amounts. You can place the greens in a small ceramic dish or simply on a clean area of the enclosure floor. Many owners offer these fresh foods either once or twice a day, removing them after a few hours to prevent spoilage. Consult your vet for the proper quantity to feed, as this can vary based on size and activity level.</p><p>Furthermore, offer a small amount of commercial rabbit pellets per day. But note that overfeeding pellets can cause digestive problems and obesity. So discuss the proper amount to feed with your vet. Place a day's worth of pellets in a small ceramic bowl. Dispose of anything left in the bowl after 24 hours before adding the next day's portion.</p><p>Finally, always make sure your rabbit has access to clean water. You can use either a water dish or bottle. Don't remove the dish until you're sure your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle, and regularly check to make sure the bottle nozzle is working. Refresh the water daily. </p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Mini rex rabbits are prone to the same health problems as most other rabbit breeds.</p><p>Many rabbits also experience overgrown teeth, which can make eating and drinking difficult. Their teeth continuously grow and must be worn down via their diet and chewing on things in their environment (such as rabbit-safe chew toys). A vet can file down the teeth as necessary.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians treat rabbits. So before bringing home a mini rex, make sure there's a vet nearby who will accept it as a patient.</p><h2>Training Your Mini Rex Rabbit </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Mini rex rabbits can be litter box trained much like a cat, which makes cage cleaning a lot easier and keeps your house sanitary when your rabbit is allowed to roam. Rabbits tend to pick one spot as their bathroom. So to litter train them, put the litter box in that spot in the enclosure. Besides litter, add some hay to the box to entice the rabbit to go in it. When you see your rabbit using the box, treat it immediately to reinforce the behavior.</p><p>If your rabbit starts to relieve itself in a different spot, move the box there or add a second box. Until your rabbit is fully litter trained, it's best to keep it confined to a small area with a litter box always nearby.</p><p>Replace the hay in the box daily, and clean the litter every other day at least. Rabbits might not use the litter box if it's dirty. Also, rabbits that aren't spayed and neutered might relieve themselves outside of the litter box as a way to mark their territory.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Make sure your mini rex gets at least four hours per day outside of its enclosure to exercise, play, and explore. But be sure to rabbit-proof your home before letting your rabbit roam. Rabbits like to chew and can get themselves in trouble if they chew on electrical cords or other hazardous items. Offer rabbit toys, food puzzles, tunnels, and more to encourage your rabbit to move.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Although rabbits spend a lot of time grooming themselves,brushingyour mini rex roughly once a week (or more often during seasonal shedding periods) will help to remove loose fur. Use a soft brush designed for use on rabbits, and brush gently to avoid damaging your rabbit's delicate skin.Not only will brushing help to prevent tangles, but it also will minimize the amount of fur your rabbit ingests from self-grooming. Too much ingested fur can cause hairballs.</p><p>You'll also have to periodically trim your mini rex'snails. If you're nervous about doing this task, many vet clinics will do it for you. Your vet can also teach you how to safely trim your rabbit's nails at home.<br/></p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Rabbits can be fairly expensive pets. Your essential expenses will be your mini rex's food and bedding/litter. On a monthly basis, plan to spend around $40 to $60, depending on the varieties you choose. You'll also periodically have to replace worn toys (especially chew toys) and other items in the enclosure at a cost of around $10 to $20. Finally, make sure to budget for routine veterinary checkups and emergency care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Mini Rex Rabbit as a Pet </h2><p>Mini rex rabbits are typically easygoing and friendly as pets. Plus, they are quiet and don't take up a massive amount of space. However, their upkeep can be expensive. And they do have high social needs that often require getting a second rabbit.<br/><br/></p><h2>Similar Rabbits to the Mini Rex </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other rabbits that can be your new pet.<br/></p>",1515

Like the pot-bellied pig, kunekune are small domestic pigs but unlike pot-bellies, they have long hair and are originally from New Zealand.</p><p>Pronounced ""koo-nee koo-nee,"" (which translates to ""fat and round""), these pigs have very similar care requirements to pet pot-bellied pigs. Some may argue they're even to care for than their less hairy relatives. They're sweet-natured, smart, and docile and come in a variety of colors, including black, white, red, gold, brown, and tricolored.</p><p>Common Name: Kunekune pig</p> <p>Adult Size: Up to 4 feet long; between 130 and 220 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Kunekune Pig? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Like with pot-bellied pigs, owning a kunekune pig as a pet is legalin many areas, though some places classify them as a form of livestock and therefore require certain types of enclosures and permits. Other places allow pigs up to a certain size to be kept as pets, as long as they are kept on a leash or in an enclosed area outdoors. Pay close attention to your state and local laws before pursuing ownership of a kunekune pig.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>As with any kind of pet, ethically owning an animal often comes down to whether or not you can provide it with what it needs to thrive. In the case of kunekune pigs, this means ample land to enjoy, proper veterinary care, companionship, and mental stimulation. As long as you are able to provide your pig with all that it needs, it would be considered ethical to own one.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Kunekune pigs come in many sizes and can be rather large, occasionally reaching up to 200 pounds. This can become a problem when you think you're adopting an adorable little piglet that then grows into a large pet that needs a lot of space.</p><p>Miniature kunekune pigs are classified by height. If your breeder says it has miniature pigs, you should ask for proof. Ask for several references of people who have purchased their pigs and then ask those people how much their pigs weigh and how tall they are. Do your homework, know what you're buying, and ask yourself if you can handle or even want to have a pet this large.</p><h2>Kunekune Pig Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Kunekune pigs are very docile and sweet, which makes them a great pet for first-time pig owners. They thrive on human interaction (including children) and will love spending time with their owners throughout the day relaxing and playing.</p><p>Kunekune pigs are incredibly intelligent and will pick up any attempts at training very quickly. That being said, this high level of intelligence means your pig will become bored (and potentially destructive) when it doesn't have enough activities and social interaction.</p><p>Additionally, all types of pigs like to root around for food with their snouts, which can potentially cause them to knock over objects in your home or destroy your yard in the process. To help redirect this behavior, hide some of their daily food intreat puzzlesor in a portion of your yard where you don't mind them rooting.</p><p>It's best to acquire your pet pig from a young age, which will give you ample time to bond with them and gain their trust. Handle your pig frequently (and gently!) to get them used to life as a pet and increase the chances that you'll have a cuddly companion.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>If you choose to house your kunekune pig indoors, provide it with a place or room of its own. Many people build them little pens into a corner of their house, while others provide them with a toddler bed or even a tent to sleep in. They prefer to move indoors and out, so make sure there is easy access to the outdoors. Since kunekune can grow to be up to 200 pounds, they need a decent amount of space to roam about and lie down. If you don't have enough space to accommodate a 200-pound pig, then you shouldn't get a kunekune.</p><p>Kunekune pigs can also be kept in a barn or outside setting. Since their main diet is grass, they thrive when they can come and go in a secure fenced-in area (often with a live wire) and sleep on sawdust or another kind of bedding in a well-ventilated shelter. They don't do well in heat, so providing them with shade and ventilation is a must. If they get too hot, they will roll around in the mud to keep their bodies cool and keep the flies from biting them. Pigs only sweat from their snouts, so it can be difficult for them to regulate their body temperature.</p><h2>What Do Kunekune Pigs Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Unlike pet pot-bellied pigs, do well just eating grass. If a high-quality pasture is not available, whether it be due to drought or just not enough grass to feed a hungry adult pig, pot-bellied pig pellets and grass pellets can be used to supplement their diet. An adult kunekune will eat 2 to 3 pounds of pellets a day (equal parts of the pot-bellied pig food and grass pellets) if it doesn't have a lot of grass (you can add hot water to the pellets to create a mash). Younger pigs will eat smaller amounts, but at least some fresh pasture should be available at all times when there is grass.</p><p>In the summer months, the pig's diet should be a combination of grass and fresh vegetables. In the fall and spring, you can add in apples for more fiber and in the winter most people substitute the pellet mixture for grass. Higher protein pellets (up to 16 percent) should be offered in very cold weather. They will also need plenty of clean, clear water available at all times and may drink up to 10 liters a day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Aside from the occasional check-up by an exotics vet, a Leptospirosis or Erysipelas vaccine every six months (depending on where you live), a deworming every six months, and proper feeding, kunekune pigs are relatively easy to care for.</p><p>Because of their long and thick hair, kunekune pigs are more susceptible to becoming infested with fleas and ticks. Pay close attention to their coat and check periodically for sicks of parasites any evidence of fleas or ticks should be removed as soon as possible and treated by a professional.</p><p>Thanks to their legendary appetite, pigs are easily overfed and can become obese as adults if special attention isn't paid to their diet. The presence of a fat rollover on your pig's eyes indicates that your pet may be overweight. Discuss your pig's diet with your veterinarian and avoid feeding them extra treats, like table scraps.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>When it comes to kunekune pigs, having enough room to roam is typically ample enough exercise for them. That being said, mental exercise and stimulation are just as important if not more to the animal. Get your pig moving at least once a day, whether that's searching for their food, doing puzzles (ones typically geared towards dogs work great), or exploring their outdoor pen.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Kunekune pigs are identified by their hairy coat, which is longer than that of a pot-bellied pig and may include tassels (also called pire) that hang off their lower jaw. Their coat comes in a variety of colors, and the hair itself can vary from silky to bristly or coarse.</p><p>Maintaining your pig's hair is less complicated than it may seem. Brushing isn't totally necessary, but if you could like to use it as a means of bonding with your pet, you can brush them periodically with a soft-bristled brush. It's also important to maintain their hooves regularly. Overgrown and unmaintained hooves, nails, and tusks can cause soreness and severe pain if left unaddressed they can even be responsible for infections, appetite loss, movement issues, and more. However, trimming can be a challenging task for a new owner, which is why we advise seeking professional help or assistance from a veterinarian.</p><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Depending on the time of year or season, a kunekune pig's hair will vary as they go through a massive shed in the summer. Generally, you do not need to assist in this natural process or provide them with a haircut.</p><h3>Bathing </h3><p>You can bathe your pig every few weeks in your tub or an outdoor bath using baby shampoo or shampoo specially formulated for pigs. You should clean their ears and the skin around their eyes regularly, beginning from when they're young so you can easily establish a mutual feeling of trust and relaxation during grooming.</p>",1432
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dwarf-hamster-species-1238947,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Dwarf Hamster</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Dwarf Hamster</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Dwarf hamsters are actually a number of tiny species of hamsters that are native primarily to desert regions around the world. These social little creatures differ from their larger, more territorial cousins, thriving in pairs or small groups as opposed to living alone. As pets, they are generally docile and easy to handle, as well as fun to watch as they tunnel and romp around in their enclosure. They're also simple to care for, requiring a fairly straightforward diet and regular cage cleaning.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Dwarf hamster, Campbell hamster, Robo (Roborovski) hamster, Syrian hamster, black bear hamster, Chinese hamster</p><p>Scientific Names: ,</p><p>Adult Size: Around 2 inches long on average; weighs roughly 1 to 2 ounces</p><p>Lifespan: 3 years in captivity</p><h2>Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Dwarf hamsters comprise a number of species, and each has some specific personality traits. For instance, the Campbell hamster is a curious little creature that's notably easy to handle. The Robo (or Roborovski) hamster a particularly tiny dwarf hamster that weighs in at just over 3/4 ounce stays asleep during the day more than other species. And the Chinese hamster (not technically a dwarf species but just as small) is known for its love of tunneling, especially through its bedding. Overall, dwarf hamsters make for captivating and low-maintenance pets. They may not necessarily form a strong bond with their humans as a dog or cat would, but they will learn to recognize you and come to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby (especially if you have a treat).</p><p>All hamsters are nocturnal, meaning they play and eat during the night and rest during the day, though some hamsters can adjust to their owners' sleeping and waking times. However, if you try to wake a sleeping hamster to handle it, the hamster might become grouchy and bite. In general, many hamsters will wake in the evening hours and happily interact with their humans then. Moreover, while hamsters make very soft and minimal vocalizations themselves, their movement during the nighttime can be an issue if you're trying to sleep. If you're a light sleeper, you probably shouldn't keep your hamster enclosure in your bedroom.</p><p>Most dwarf hamsters take well to people holding them, but they will nip if they feel uncomfortable. They don't necessarily need other hamster companions, but keeping them in same-sex pairs or small groups can help to make them feel more comfortable. They generally should be kept away from other pets, including other species of hamsters.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Dwarf hamsters slightly range in size, depending on the species. On average, they reach around 2 inches long and weigh 1 to 2 ounces. They'll generally reach maturity at around 2 months old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A dwarf hamster's habitat should be as large as possible, allowing for maximum exercise and play. A cage that's roughly a 2-foot square with a height of around a foot is the bare minimum that some animal groups recommend. Habitat options generally include a glass or plastic aquarium with a secure top that has ventilation or a cage that's wire with a plastic base. Wire cages allow for better airflow to prevent overheating, though they don't protect as well as plastic or glass do against drafts. You must make sure that the wire spacing is close enough that your hamster can't squeeze through the bars.</p><p>Include an exercise wheel in the enclosure that has a solid surface, not bars, for your hamster to run on.Also, provide plenty of wooden chew sticks or mineral chews in the enclosure. Chewing maintains a hamster's incisor teeth, which grow continuously. Plus, add a small nest or sleeping hut (available at most pet shops) for your hamster to rest and hide in when it wants to feel secure.</p><p>Hamsters acclimate well to average household temperatures. Just be cautious of extreme temperature changes, and keep the habitat away from direct sunlight and drafts.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>On the bottom of the cage, there should be a 1- to 2-inch layer of bedding, such as chemical- and dye-free shredded paper or hardwood shavings. Change the bedding once a week when you clean all surfaces in the enclosure with soap and water, and remove wet spots daily.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Avoid cedar-based bedding, as it can be toxic to small animals.</p><h2>What Do Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>A bowl of food and a small dish or bottle of fresh water should always be available to your pet dwarf hamster. Consult your veterinarian on the proper quantity to feed. In general, you should feed your hamster once per day, ideally in the evening when it's waking up and becoming active. Discard any uneaten food after 24 hours.</p><p>Look for a commercial hamster food blend that's specifically formulated for dwarf hamsters. This will provide your hamster with all the vitamins and minerals it needs. You can also offer limited amounts of certain seeds, grains, fruits, and vegetables, including oats, carrots, and greens. Supplemental food should only make up around 10% of your hamster's overall daily diet.</p><p>Keep sugary and high-fat foods to a minimum, and avoid toxic foods including macadamia nuts, avocados, and chocolate.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Dwarf hamsters are prone to a variety of health problems. Hair loss and skin lesions can result from several different issues. The most common culprits include the animal rubbing on something in the enclosure or being attacked by a cage mate. Any skin abnormalities should be checked as soon as possible by a vet, as they can quickly become infected.</p><p>Hamsters also are prone to digestive upset, which usually goes along with some type of infection of the digestive tract. Wet tail, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, sometimes results from stressful or unsanitary living conditions. Hamsters with wet tail should be treated immediately by a vet, as this condition can lead to death as early as 24 hours after symptoms.</p><p>Some dwarf hamsters, especially Campbell's hamsters and Chinese hamsters, are prone to diabetes. However, this often can be prevented by keeping your pet's diet low in sugar and providing plenty of opportunities for exercise.</p><p>While yellow teeth are normal on a hamster, sometimes its teeth can become overgrown, especially if it doesn't have enough chewable materials to wear them down. Overgrown teeth can affect a hamster's ability to eat, so they will likely have to be trimmed by a vet. The vet can then make sure you're doing everything possible to keep the teeth at a normal length.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Before acquiring a dwarf hamster, make sure there's a veterinarian near you who will treat it. Not all vets have experience with this animal.</p><h2>Training Your Dwarf Hamster </h2><p>Calm, gentle handling from a young age can help a hamster feel safe when held. It's best to sit on the ground in a secure space (such as a small bedroom with the door shut) when holding your hamster, as these animals can move quite quickly and might break free of your hold if you're not paying attention. You don't ever want your hamster to drop from a great height even a couple feet is a lot for them as this can severely injure the little animal. It's also important never to squeeze your hamster in your hands, as this can result in injury for the animal or cause it to bite you.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Providing an exercise wheel and a large enough enclosure should give the hamster what it needs to stay fit and prevent obesity and other health issues. There also are exercise balls for the hamster to roam around in outside of its enclosure. Make sure the ball is the proper size for a dwarf hamster, and always monitor the hamster when it's outside the enclosure.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Hamsters are fairly clean animals that groom themselves. They do not need baths. But if they do get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur you can help them clean up by gently rubbing the spot with a damp cloth.</p>",1308

They make great companion animals, including for kids. They are playful animals that desire human companionship, as well as socialization with other rats. Rats require a moderate amount of care, but, once you get past the initial setup of the enclosure, it's fairly straightforward. Their formulated diet can be found in most pet stores. Plus, their housing doesn't take up much space and is pretty simple to maintain.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Rat</p> <p>Adult Size: 14 to 18 inches (tail included)</p><p>Lifespan: 2 to 3 years</p><h2>Rat Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Rats are social creatures, and most can learn to be comfortable with and even enjoy gentle handling by people. They recognize their owners and will even get excited to see their favorite humans. They tend to bond with whoever cares for them and socializes with them the most. So besides spending some time on their daily enclosure upkeep, daily interaction is a must.</p><p>Rats are largely nocturnal, but they can be active for periods during the day. A good time to interact with them is often in the evening hours.</p><p>To hand-tame a rat, start slowly by enticing it to explore your hands as you hold treats. Always make sure you're supporting the rat's weight when picking it up, and never squeeze it. Once a rat is comfortable with this kind of handling, it will likely want to climb on you to explore. Many rats like perching on their owners' shoulders or cuddling in their laps. And they don't typically bite unless they feel threatened.</p><p>Rats are overall quiet pets, though they do make some soft vocalizations. It's best to keep them away from other household pets to prevent undue stress and potential injuries. But they do prefer to live in pairs or small groups. A female pair can often coexist peacefully. A pair of males will sometimes become territorial but can do well if they're introduced at a young age. A female and male also can live together as long as they are spayed and/or neutered. Otherwise, you will quickly find yourself breeding lots of rats.</p><h3>8 Things to Know Before Adopting a Pet Rat</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Rats reach around 14 to 18 inches long on average, including the length of their tail. They weigh between roughly 0.5 and 1.5 pounds, with males generally being larger than females.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A powder-coated wire cage with a solid-floor base is ideal for pet rats. It will allow good air circulation but still be comfortable on the rats' feet. For two rats, the minimum cage size should be 2 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, but bigger is always better. Because rats like to climb, a multilevel cage would be suitable to give them more exercise and enrichment.</p><p>Keep the enclosure in a relatively quiet spot. And make sure it is out of drafts and direct sunlight.Stable temperatures between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit are best.</p><p>Within the enclosure, provide rat toys especially chew toys. And add a nest box. You can opt for a store-bought small animal nest, or use a small cardboard box or half of a clay flowerpot turned in its side.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Place a few inches of bedding materials, such as aspen or paper pellet bedding, on the bottom of the enclosure. Avoid cedar and pine bedding, as their oils can be harmful to rats. You also can add some shredded paper towels or napkins for your rats to use to make a soft nest. Change the bedding weekly when you scrub down all surfaces in the cage with a mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Rats Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Always have fresh water available for rats. A water bottle that attaches to the side of the enclosure is ideal, as it's easy to keep sanitary. But offer a water bowl as well until you're sure the rats are using the bottle.</p><p>Use heavy ceramic food dishes, as they are difficult to gnaw and tip. Pelleted or block-type diets are typically fed as a rat's primary food. They are formulated to be nutritionally complete. Follow the feeding instructions on your chosen diet, and be sure to run it by your vet. It's common to offer a day's worth of pellets in a dish, disposing of uneaten food after 24 hours before adding the next day's portion. Rats tend to graze during their waking hours.</p><p>Fresh foods can be offered to supplement the diet and prevent boredom with the pellets. Try feeding your pet rats small amounts of fruits and vegetables, whole grain pasta and bread, brown rice, and plain yogurt. Occasionally, you can offer low-fat cooked meat, mealworms, cheese, seeds, and nuts. It is important to keep rats on a high-fiber and low-fat diet.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Rats are typically hardy pets.</p><p>Furthermore, rat teeth continuously grow. And if rats don't have enough materials in their environment to gnaw, their teeth can become overgrown and impact their ability to eat. A vet can help identify and correct overgrown teeth.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians accept rats as patients. So before even acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet near you who will treat it.</p><h2>Training Your Rat </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Because rats are very smart and naturally tend to pick one spot to use as their bathroom, it is possible to litter box train them. Get a litter box made for small animals that your rat can easily get in and out of, and fill it with a different kind of litter from the main cage bedding. Place the box in the spot where your rat normally relieves itself.</p><p>It can help to put some soiled bedding in the box to show your rat that this is the spot to go. However, if the box becomes too soiled, the rat might not want to use it anymore. If your rat starts relieving itself in a different spot, move the box there or add a second box if you have the space. It should catch on fairly quickly, though not all rats will become fully litter trained. Make sure to change the litter in the box daily.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>It is important that rats exercise every day not only to keep them physically fit but also to stimulate their minds. Rats love to climb and will make good use of ladders, ropes, hammocks, tunnels, and platforms in their enclosure. Some rats like to run on an exercise wheel. If you include one, make sure it has a solid surface, not wires, to prevent injury.</p><p>Besides rat toys, they also enjoy toys made for ferrets and parrots. But look for rope and wood toys, as most plastic can't stand up to the gnawing of a determined rat. Moreover, simple items like large cardboard mailing tubes, crumpled paper, paper bags, and cardboard boxes can also make wonderful homemade rat toys. Because rats are very intelligent, it's best to rotate the toys on a regular basis to avoid boredom.</p><p>Take your rat outside of its enclosure on a daily basis as well for exercise. But be sure to rat-proof the area because rats will chew on just about anything they can reach. Keep electrical wires out of reach, and ensure that your rat cannot access anything that is toxic.</p><p>Rats also tend to scent mark as they roam, leaving little drops of urine. The odor is not offensive, but you might want to cover furniture with a throw while they are out of the cage. They will also scent mark on their owners, so be prepared.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Rats are very clean animals that mostly self-groom. But they might require nail trims if they don't naturally wear down their nails. Your vet can either take care of this for you or show you how to do it at home. Moreover, rats don't need water for baths. But if they happen to get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can help them get it out by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth.</p>",1327

They also need a large enclosure in which they can exercise. Plus, their diet is somewhat complex because there aren't commercial foods made specifically for them. Overall, this rodent is a pretty high-maintenance pet that requires a knowledgeable and dedicated owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Gambian pouched rat</p> <p>Adult Size: 28 inches to 36 inches long, weighing 2 to 3 pounds on average</p><p>Lifespan: 7 years on average</p><h2>Gambian Pouched Rat Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Temperament varies among Gambian pouched rats, and some are easier to tame than others. As pets, certain rats will remain skittish and possibly aggressive into adulthood despite your best efforts to socialize with them. However, with regular handling most become friendly and gentle. They're very intelligent and playful animals. Some of them even like belly rubs.</p><p>As youngsters, Gambian pouched rats often go through a nippy stage during play and need gentle training to break the habit. Give a firm ""no"" or loud ""ouch,"" and end playtime if it recurs. They also will sometimes grasp you with their mouths not a bite, just a hold and try to push you away if they object to something. Respect this as their way to communicate, but give a ""no"" or ""ouch"" if the hold is ever painful. While some like to be held and cuddled, others will squirm away from handling but are still friendly overall. Most do tend to form strong bonds with the people who care for them.</p><p>These rats are social animals and can be housed in pairs or small groups. However, some males can be quite territorial and aggressive. This is particularly the case around sexual maturity, and they often calm down again given time and patience. Still, it's best not to house two males together, as they likely will fight. Two females can typically coexist well, especially when raised together from a young age. And spayed and neutered males and females also can live together. Furthermore, it's best to keep these rodents away from any other pets in the household, as they might injure one another.</p><p>Expect to spend a lot of time each day caring for your pet socializing with it, feeding it, and keeping its habitat clean. These rodents are nocturnal, so your social time with them will likely have to take place in the evening. Furthermore, some owners are unprepared for the destructive abilities of Gambian pouched rats. Like other rodents, they need to chew. And with their large teeth, they can do a lot of damage quickly chewing your possessions if they aren't supervised when outside of their cage. Fortunately, these are fairly quiet pets overall, though they do make some chirping noises.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Invasive Gambian Pouched Rat</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Gambian pouched rats stretch roughly 28 inches to 36 inches from nose to tail tip. And they weigh 2 to 3 pounds on average.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Gambian pouched rats need a large, sturdy enclosure. In general, the cage should be as large as you can fit and afford. At minimum, it can be around 3 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet tall.</p><p>Powder-coated metal or stainless steel are the best cage materials, as these rodents can easily chew through wood or plastic. And a multi-level cage with ramps and platforms is ideal, such as one you would have for a ferret or chinchilla. Avoid any cages with wire floors or shelves, as this can hurt their feet.</p><p>Add a nest box and a variety of wooden chew toys to the enclosure. Large wooden parrot toys often work well. Some dog chew toys also can be beneficial. But plastic toys are hazardous, as your rodent might break off and ingest a piece. An exercise wheel is also an excellent idea. The wheel should have a solid metal surface with at least a 15-inch diameter.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>At the bottom of the enclosure, add a few inches of aspen wood shavings, dye-free paper, or pulp-based material for bedding. Don't use cedar or pine, as their oils can be dangerous to rodents. Plus, provide some paper towels or tissues (with no dyes or perfumes) that your rat can use as nesting material.</p><p>If your cage doesn't have a base to hold in the bedding, you can add a urine shield a strip of metal or plastic that goes around the outside of the lower part of the cage. This also helps to prevent waste from coming out of the cage, as the rodents generally choose a corner as their bathroom.</p><p>Clean the cage thoroughly on a weekly basis. Change all the bedding, and scrub the surfaces with mild soap and water. Also, spot clean throughout the week by removing soiled bedding.</p><h2>What Do Gambian Pouched Rats Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Gambian pouched rats are omnivores in the wild, eating plants and animals including various vegetation, insects, and small mammals. As pets, they need a varied diet that includes a commercial rat grain mix, fresh fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, insects (such as crickets and mealworms), and cooked lean meats and eggs. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate quantity and variety to feed for the size, age, and activity level of your animal.</p><p>It's typically best to feed any perishable foods in the evening when rats are waking up and hungry, so they consume them quickly. You can leave the other foods, such as the grains and seeds, in a small bowl in the enclosure for your rodent to graze on. Remove any uneaten food within 24 hours. A small ceramic bowl or a stainless steel bowl that attaches to the side of the enclosure work best for feeding. Your rat will be able to flip lightweight bowls and chew through anything made of plastic.</p><p>Also, remember that Gambian pouched rats stuff their cheeks with food and often store it in another part of their enclosure for a later meal. So monitor the cage for uneaten food hidden in the bedding that will spoil.</p><p>Your rat will always need access to fresh water. A water bottle attached to the side of the enclosure is ideal to keep the water clean. But keep a water dish in the enclosure as well until you're sure your rat is consistently drinking from the bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians have experience treating Gambian pouched rats. So before acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet near you who will accept it as a patient.</p><h2>Training Your Gambian Pouched Rat </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Like other rodents, Gambian pouched rats tend to pick one spot often a corner of their enclosure as their bathroom. Some owners place a litter box there to make cleaning easier. It can be helpful to use a different kind of bedding in the litter box to help your rat differentiate between it and the rest of the enclosure. If your rat switches to using a different corner, move the litter box there.</p><p>Eventually, the rat should accept the litter box as its bathroom. If you catch it using the litter box, immediately offer a favorite treat to reinforce the behavior. Clean the litter box every couple of days, as a rat might avoid using a dirty box.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Exercise is essential for Gambian pouched rats to provide mental stimulation and keep them physically fit, helping to ward off health issues such as obesity. They should get at least a few hours out of their cage each day for supervised playtime and socialization. Make sure to provide toys both in and out of the cage to encourage them to move.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Gambian pouched rats will regularly self-groom. They generally don't need baths, but you occasionally might need to help them clean dirt embedded in their fur by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your essential regular costs for a Gambian pouched rat will be its food and bedding. Expect to pay around $20 to $50 on average per month, depending on the varieties you choose and how large your enclosure is. Also, you'll regularly have to replace chew toys and other worn items at a cost of around $10 to $20. Finally, make sure to budget for routine veterinary checkups and emergency care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Gambian Pouched Rat as a Pet </h2><p>Gambian pouched rats make interesting, intelligent, and playful pets. They also are fairly quiet and don't take up a massive amount of space. However, their diet can be complicated because there aren't commercial foods made especially for them. And they need a lot of attention to keep them tame.</p>",1452

Its body is compact, but its erect ears are rather large at around 2 to 3 inches long. Lionheads come in a wide range of colors. As pets, these rabbits are generally friendly, playful, and social, though some can be timid. They require daily interaction and a moderate amount of maintenance.They need a varied diet and housing that gives them room to exercise.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Lionhead rabbit</p> <p>Adult Size: 8 to 10 inches long, weighing 2.5 to 3.5 pounds on average</p><p>Lifespan: 7 to 10 years</p><h2>Lionhead Rabbit Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Lionhead rabbits are generally smart, good-natured, and energetic. They love to play and socialize. And many form close bonds with their humans and enjoy cuddling and petting.</p><p>However, some lionheads can be rather skittish. They typically don't bite, but they might try to scratch you if they feel uncomfortable with handling. Most rabbits generally don't enjoy being picked up.</p><p>To satisfy the lionhead's social needs, it's ideal to keep more than one rabbit. Members of the opposite sex can be kept together if they are spayed and neutered. Plus, some rabbits even form bonds with other household pets, including calm, well-mannered cats and dogs. However, it's critical to do slow and safe introductions between animals (including other rabbits) to ensure they can coexist peacefully.</p><p>As pets, rabbits are generally quiet animals that require daily feedings and regular cleanings. They also need supervised time each day outside of their enclosure to play and socialize. Plus, they should have toys especially chew toys in and out of their enclosure to keep them busy. Rabbits that don't get enough mental and physical stimulation might become destructive and potentially do some unwanted chewing or digging.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Lionhead rabbits stretch around 8 to 10 inches long on average and typically weigh less than 4 pounds.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Although the lionhead rabbit is small, it's still an active breed that needs plenty of space to burn off energy. As a general rule, a cage for small rabbit breeds like the lionhead should be at least 18 by 24 inches and tall enough for the rabbit to stretch fully upright on its hind legs. However, bigger is always better, and the cage size must be increased for multiple rabbits.</p><p>Avoid cages with wire bottoms, as they can harm a rabbit's feet. A plastic-bottom dog crate can be a good option. And some owners opt for a dog exercise pen to allow for even more space while still keeping the rabbit secure. Make sure to keep the enclosure away from drafts.</p><p>Within the enclosure, include food and water dishes, toys, a litter box, and a shelf onto which your rabbit can hop for exercise. You also can include tunnels and solid-floor ramps in cages that have multiple levels. Just make sure there's enough room for the rabbit to fully stretch out with its back legs extended on the floor of the enclosure.</p><p>When you allow your rabbit to roam outside of its enclosure, make sure the area is fully rabbit-proofed. Rabbits are known to chew on electrical cords and other potentially hazardous items at ground level.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The floor of the enclosure should be nonslip. Many owners use washable carpeting to add some softness for their rabbit. Also, you can put down some straw for your rabbit to nest in. In the litter box, use dye-free paper litter; never use clumping litter. Clean the litter box at least every other day, and scrub everything in the enclosure weekly with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Lionhead Rabbits Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Rabbits are herbivores. Plus, their teeth continuously grow, so they need a diet that will naturally help to wear down the teeth.</p><p>Provide your lionhead with unlimited amounts of grass hay, such as timothy hay, each day. You can simply pile hay in the enclosure or use a feeder called a hopper. Make sure there is always some hay available for the rabbit.</p><p>Also, offer a variety of green leafy vegetables, including lettuces, herbs, and carrot tops. And offer more limited amounts of other fruits and veggies, such as carrots. Fresh foods can simply be placed on the enclosure floor or in a small dish. You can offer them once or twice a day, but remove any uneaten fresh foods after a few hours to prevent spoilage. Consult your vet for the best quantity and variety to feed for your rabbit.</p><p>Furthermore, feed a limited about of rabbit pellets. Too many pellets can result in digestive issues and obesity. So be sure to discuss a feeding plan with your vet. Put a day's supply of pellets in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure. Dispose of any uneaten pellets after 24 hours before providing the next day's portion.</p><p>Finally, make sure your rabbit always has access to fresh water. You can either use a ceramic water dish or a bottle. Just make sure the bottle is always functional and that your rabbit knows how to drink from it. Refresh the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <p>Overgrown teeth also can be a problem if your rabbit isn't wearing them down properly via their diet and chew toys. You might notice your rabbit has difficulty eating or is losing weight. Vets can trim the teeth as necessary.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians see rabbits as patients. So as you consider acquiring a lionhead rabbit, make sure there is a vet nearby who can treat it.</p><h2>Training Your Rabbit </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Because lionhead rabbits are very smart, they often respond to litter training faster than the average pet rabbit. Providing a litter box makes cleaning the enclosure much easier, and it keeps your house sanitary when your rabbit is allowed to roam. Until your rabbit is litter trained, it's best to confine them to a small area where there's always a litter box nearby.</p><p>Rabbits naturally tend to pick a spot to use as their bathroom. So place the litter box in that spot in the enclosure to encourage them to use it. Also, add some hay in the litter box to entice them to get in. When you see them eliminating in the box, immediately offer a treat to reinforce the behavior.</p><p>Replace the hay daily to keep it sanitary, and replace the litter every couple of days. Rabbits don't like using dirty litter boxes. In addition, rabbits that aren't spayed or neutered are likely to relieve themselves outside of the litter box to mark their territory.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>A minimum of four hours per day for your rabbit to exercise outside of its enclosure is ideal. Physical activity is essential to keep a rabbit fit and prevent health issues, such as obesity. Always supervise a rabbit outside of its enclosure. To encourage it to move around, make sure to offer toys, such as treat puzzles, balls, and tunnels.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Lionheads have roughly 2 inches of fur around their neck with a slightly shorter coat overall. It's a soft, thick coat that needs regular grooming. Rabbits do groom themselves, but giving them some help via brushing out loose fur helps to prevent them from ingesting fur. Too much ingested fur can cause hairballs that might block a rabbit's digestive system.</p><p>Brush at least a couple times per week. Give extra attention to the longer fur to prevent uncomfortable knots and mats. Lionheads also go through heavier shedding periods often in the spring and fall when you'll likely have to brush more regularly to keep up with the loose fur.</p><p>In terms of other grooming, you'll often have to trim a rabbit's nails, as they don't naturally wear them down in their indoor environment. Your vet can show you how to properly do a nail trim. Baths generally won't be necessary for a rabbit, but you can spot clean its coat as necessary by gently rubbing it with a damp cloth.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Rabbits are fairly expensive animals, especially when compared to many other small pets. Your primary costs will be their diet and bedding/litter. Plan to spend around $40 to $60 per month on average, depending on the varieties you choose and how many rabbits you have. You'll also have to replace worn toys and other items in the enclosure periodically at a cost of around $10 to $20. And be sure to budget for both routine veterinary care and emergencies.</p>",1394

It's generally easy to tame, fun to watch, and fairly low-maintenance, making it a good pet for beginners. These hamsters come from arid regions of northern Syria and southern Turkey. Most are golden brown with a lighter belly. But selective breeding has given rise to several variations in color, pattern, and hair length. Thanks to their popularity as pets, diets specially formulated for Syrian hamsters can be found in most pet stores. Plus, their housing doesn't take up that much space and is pretty simple to set up and maintain.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Syrian hamster, golden hamster</p> <p>Adult Size: 5 to 9 inches long, weighing roughly 5 ounces</p><p>Lifespan: 2 to 4 years</p><h2>Syrian Hamster Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Syrian hamsters sleep during the day and are active at night. And while they are generally quiet pets, their nighttime activity might keep you awake if you have their enclosure in your bedroom.</p><p>Certain hamsters can somewhat adapt to their humans' schedule, but you should never try to pick up a sleeping hamster. Some hamsters might bite when startled or handled improperly. Thus, the early morning or evening hours are a good time to interact with your hamster.And as long as you don't squeeze or jostle your hamster as you hold it, it should learn to be content with people handling it.</p><p>These hamsters are one of the most solitary animals in the wild, making them equally territorial. That means they should always be housed alone as pets. Sometimes young hamsters tolerate cage mates for a little while. But as they mature, there's a good chance they'll become aggressive, even fighting to the death. It's also best to keep any other household pets away from your hamster, as they could hurt each other.</p><p>As pets, Syrian hamsters don't necessarily form a close bond with their owners. But they often will come up to the side of their enclosure if you're there, and many will enjoy lounging in your hands or on your shoulder. Expect to spend a few hours per week on feedings and maintaining your hamster's habitat. After that, just make sure you're allotting some time each day to handle your hamster to keep it tame.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Syrian hamsters reach around 5 to 9 inches long on average, and they weigh roughly 5 ounces. They'll reach maturity within two months.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>As large of an enclosure as you can accommodate for a Syrian hamster is best, as this will be its primary space for exercise. At a minimum, the cage should be 1 foot by 2 feet and at least a foot tall. The two general cage options are one that has wire on top with a plastic base or a standard glass or plastic aquarium with a tightly fitting mesh top. The wire cages allow for better airflow, though they offer less protection against drafts.</p><p>In the enclosure, include plenty of hamster toys for enrichment. An exercise wheel that has a solid surface (not bars) is ideal, as this minimizes the risk of injuries. Other options include tunnels and bridges for hiding and climbing, as well as wooden chew blocks for dental hygiene. Also, add a nest or sleeping hut (pet shops typically have several options) in a corner of the enclosure.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Line the bottom of the enclosure with a couple of inches of bedding. Paper or aspen products are recommended. Don't use cedar or pine bedding, as the strong smell can be harmful to a hamster. Scoop out any wet spots in the bedding daily. And change all the bedding weekly as you scrub down the entire enclosure with soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Syrian Hamsters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Feed your Syrian hamster a diet of nuts, grains, and seeds (typically what's in the commercial food blends) supplemented with fruits and vegetables, such as apples, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, and pears. And because Syrian hamsters are omnivores (they eat plants and animals), offer the occasional hardboiled egg or feeder insect for an extra protein shot. If you use a commercial food blend, the supplemental foods generally shouldn't make up more than 10 percent of the hamster's overall diet. But consult your veterinarian for the best quantity and variety to feed, as this can vary based on age and size.</p><p>Always keep a bowl of dry food in the enclosure, and discard uneaten food after 24 hours. Hamsters typically like to graze, storing food in their cheek pouches and stashing it somewhere for later. Your hamster might even wake up a few times a day to eat and then go back to sleep. Whenever you're feeding fresh foods, it's often best to offer them in a separate dish in the evening when your hamster is waking up from its slumber and ready to eat. Remove uneaten fresh food after a few hours, so it doesn't spoil.</p><p>Moreover, always provide a clean source of water for your hamster that you refresh daily. Many people prefer to use water bottles because they are easy to keep sanitary. But you also can use a shallow dish for water until your hamster learns to drink from the bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Syrian hamsters are generally hardy animals. However, there are a few health conditions to watch out for. Wet tail a gastrointestinal infection usually associated with stress and bacteria proliferation is one of the most common health issues affecting this hamster. Symptoms include lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, and wetness around the tail area. If you suspect an infection, take your hamster to the vet immediately. This issue can have a fatal outcome if allowed to fester, but antibiotics can effectively treat it.</p><p>Hamsters can also contract fur and ear mites, especially from unsanitary conditions. If your hamster has mites, you might notice itching and loss of fur in patches. If so, contact your vet as soon as possible for treatment.</p><p>Furthermore, some hamsters can develop overgrown teeth that make eating difficult. You might notice your hamster's teeth look a little longer than normal and that it's losing weight. A vet can trim the teeth and then recommend ways to maintain the hamster's dental health, such as adding more chewable materials to the enclosure.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians have experience treating hamsters. So before acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet nearby who will be able to see your hamster.</p><h2>Training Your Syrian Hamster </h2><p>Hand-taming is the primary training most people do with their hamsters. It's ideal to begin when the hamster is still young, so it learns to be comfortable around people. Sit on the floor in a secure space when handling your hamster, as even a drop from a few feet can harm it. It can help to hold a favorite treat to make the hamster's experience sitting in your hands more enjoyable. If it starts to get stressed, put it back in its enclosure.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Between having a sufficiently large enclosure to roam about and an exercise wheel, your hamster should be able to remain fit. Exercise is important to prevent obesity and other health issues. You also can put your hamster in an exercise ball when it's out of the enclosure for it to roll safely around your floor. Always monitor your hamster when it's out of the enclosure.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Hamsters are fairly clean animals that self-groom. They do not need water for baths. If they do get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can help them get it out by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>From month to month, your main costs for a hamster will be its food and bedding. Expect to spend around $20 to $40, depending on the type of bedding (plus the size of enclosure) and diet you choose. Beyond that, you'll occasionally have to replace chew blocks, nests, and other items in the enclosure. And you should budget for an annual veterinary checkup plus emergency medical costs.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Syrian Hamster as a Pet </h2><p>Syrian hamsters are generally low-maintenance, quiet, and interesting pets. They're fun to watch and can be tamed to hold. However, they are fragile small animals that need a gentle touch. And they are typically asleep for most of the day, so you might not get to see them at their most active.</p>",1395

However, they are very difficult to properly care for. While they are extraordinarily intelligent and affectionate animals, this intelligence can lead to boredom and destructive behavior as they grow. Plus, chimpanzees thrive in social settings, so you must be able to dedicate a lot of time to these animals and have a large, durable enclosure in which you can house them. Chimps also require a varied diet to stay healthy. Most people are not able to meet their overall care needs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Chimpanzee, chimp</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size: up to 5 feet tall; 60 to 115 pounds (females are typically smaller than males)</p><p>Lifespan:50 years or more in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Chimpanzee? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Even though they are quite endearing, pet chimps still behave like wild animals. It's illegal to own one in most parts of the U.S. Still, some states including Texas, Kansas, Idaho, and Alabama allow pet chimps. You will likely need a permit to keep a chimp. And you must know your local exotic pet laws, which might prohibit ownership even if your state allows it.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Owning a chimp, like any large wild animal, is likely to prove detrimental for both the animal and its keeper. Chimpanzees have evolved to live freely among their own kind in the wild. Keeping a chimp isolated with humans in a captive setting, no matter how loving, can result in depression and health problems for the chimp. In addition, there is the ethical issue of human safety; even the most docile chimp may become agitated and harm people with whom it interacts.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Owning a chimpanzee is largely illegal and a widespread, contentious ethical issue. Safety is also a concern to consider. Adult chimps are much stronger than most humans, so an unruly chimp may easily harm or even kill its owner.</p><h2>Chimpanzee Behavior and Temperament </h2><h3>Warning</h3><p>Adult chimpanzees are much stronger than even large adult humans, and they can become aggressive. Chimps have hurt and even killed people in captivity.</p><p>Chimpanzees are found in forests and savannas of Central and West Africa. In the wild, they live in close-knit family groups of up to 120 chimps. They're very social creatures, eating and sleeping together as well as grooming and playing with each other. Young chimps nurse for the first five years of their life and are not considered adults until age 13.</p><p>As pets, chimps are active, strong, noisy, and extremely hands-on. They will generally form bonds with their human family members, especially if you acquire them at a young age. And many enjoy being held and playing with humans.</p><p>But once they reach adulthood, chimps can become quite physical and demanding, leaving many chimp owners unable to control their animals. Even when raised in captivity, they retain their wild instincts, making them unpredictable.Their moods can change from friendly to violent without an obvious trigger, and they will swing their limbs and bite out of aggression. Pet chimps have mauled humans even people they know and seemingly care about.</p><p>Thus, it's important to exercise caution when interacting with your chimp and monitor the situation closely if you allow other people to visit with your animal. It's also not recommended to allow chimps to interact with any other pets in the household, as they can potentially injure one another. Furthermore, if left with nothing to do, a chimp will quickly get bored and can cause serious damage to your home.</p><p>On the plus side, chimps' intelligence can be appealing to some pet owners. Chimps can be trained as service animals to help their owners with tasks, such as opening doors and picking up items. Some also can learn to communicate using sign language.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Because chimps are at least twice as strong as humans, they require a very sturdy enclosure to keep them contained when you are unable to watch them. They cannot be trusted left alone in your home.</p><p>You can construct a large outdoor enclosure for them with metal fencing and metal bars to form a secure ceiling. The door to the enclosure should have a strong lock, as chimps can easily learn how to open latches and knobs. Add ropes, swings, branches, balls, and other favorite toys to the enclosure. And make sure your animal always has access to shade. You also can keep them in a room in your house for short spells when you can't watch them. Child-proof the room as you would for a toddler. Plus, glass windows should be protected by bars to prevent a strong chimp from shattering them.</p><p>For the most part, though, expect to have your chimp with you or someone in your household the majority of the time to fulfill its social and activity needs.</p><h2>What Do Chimpanzees Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Chimpanzees are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. Fruit, leaves, insects, eggs, tree bark, nuts, and occasionally even small animals are all part of a wild chimpanzee's diet.</p><p>In captivity, your pet's primary food source should be a formulated and nutritionally complete ""monkey chow."" Simply measure out the food in a bowl for your chimp each day choose an unbreakable bowl, such as stainless steel following package instructions for how much and how often to feed based on your animal's age and size. Chimps often get on a feeding routine and prefer their meals at the same time each day. Your chimp should also have access to a dish of fresh water at all times, which you refresh at least daily.</p><p>While these formulated diets offer much of what a chimpanzee needs, feeding them this way fails to encourage natural foraging behaviors important mental stimulation for a chimp. Opening nuts, digging for insects, picking leaves off of branches, and biting into fruit and eggs are important to the well-being of a chimp. So offer these foods as a supplement to the formulated diet. And avoid giving your chimp any processed or fatty foods, as this will not support a long, healthy life.</p><p>In general, your chimp should eat about 4 percent of its body weight in food daily. That means if your chimp weighs 100 pounds, it should eat about 4 pounds of food a day, though this can vary based on an individual animal's health and activity level. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate feeding schedule for your animal.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Regular veterinary visits should be a part of your chimp's life. And it's important to find a veterinarian who has ample experience dealing with chimps. Heart disease, dental disease, and diabetes are all common illnesses that pet chimpanzees are prone to. These diseases often arise from a poor diet and might present with lethargy or a lack of appetite. If this occurs, consult your vet as soon as possible.</p><p>Also, discuss vaccinations with your vet based on the diseases your animal might be exposed to. For instance, vaccination campaigns are in place in Africa to protect wild chimp populations from life-threatening diseases, such as ebola. In the U.S., your vet might recommend vaccinating for measles, polio, and tetanus.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Chimpanzees are very active animals that need a lot of exercise. In the wild, they frequently climb trees and swing from limbs, so they need structures in captivity that mimic trees. In zoos, chimp enclosures often include both real and man-made trees, ropes, and suspended nets on which resident chimpanzees can play and exercise. These are the sorts of environments that give captive chimps the physical activity they need to stay healthy and happy.</p><h2>Purchasing a Chimpanzee </h2><p>Before you take on a pet chimp, it's important to give the issue serious thought. Ask yourself: Will a chimp truly be able to have a happy, long, and normal primate life in your home? Will you be able to afford to care for a pet that will live for more than several decades?</p><p>You also must be sure you'll be able to manage your chimp as it grows in strength and keep it safely contained on your property. There have been cases of pet chimps escaping their enclosures and attacking people. You might even have to separate your chimp from visitors to your home if your chimp shows signs of aggression, such as attempting to bite them.</p>",1370

They spend most of their waking hours searching for food, urinating to mark their territory, and hanging out in trees. Most capuchin monkeyowners use diapers for the monkey's entire life and keep them on leashes in and out of the house for both the safety of the monkey and the public.</p><p>Capuchin monkeys were trained as service animals until 2010, when the American Disabilities Act deemed them a danger to both owners and the public due to disease transmission and aggression. The American Veterinary Medical Association also discourages the use of primates in service, making it difficult to find an exotic vet to treat pet capuchins.</p><p>Captive capuchin monkeys are charming as babies and need to be cared for similarly as a human baby would. Capuchin babies can form a tight bond with their human mother or father, may need to be bottle-fed for some time (if not forever), and will need to be trained to be a part of the family. You can hire a specialized monkey trainer, although some trainers may use questionable training methods you'll want to avoid. Some trainers recommend removing all four canine teeth from the monkey to prevent serious bite injuries down the road. This practice is yet another debatable issue, and few veterinarians will perform the procedure.</p><p>Once they reach age five, capuchin monkeys become much harder to handle. A bored monkey may display aggression, biting its owner or someone else in order to get attention or garner interest. It may also try to escape its enclosure or misbehave even throwing feces. Aggressive behavior is typical in capuchin monkeys and can sometimes occur without prior tendencies.</p><h3>Are Capuchin Monkeys Good Pets?</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>In the wild, capuchins swing from tree to tree, something that most home enclosures don't permit. The lack of natural habitat in a home setting raises much controversy regarding keeping these monkeys at all. Typically, there isn't nearly enough space or foliage safely enclosed in the average yard to allow the primate proper exercise.</p><p>That said, the bigger the enclosure, the better. If you do decide to house a capuchin monkey, make sure it has plenty of trees to swing and jump from, provide a shaded area for shelter from the elements, and be sure it's monkey-proofed. Even healthy and happy monkeys are curious, and a breakout is inevitable if they're given the time and an outlet.</p><h2>What Do Capuchin Monkeys Eat and Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, capuchin monkeys eat bugs, fruit, small birds, nuts, and flowers. Mimicking this monkey's natural diet in captivity can be somewhat tricky. A high-quality, formulated monkey chow provides the bulk of their nutritional needs, while ample outdoor space allows them to forage. You can also supplement their diet with baby food, fruits, and vegetables (cut to size) a varied diet keeps a monkey interested, especially if you hide it, and they have to search for it. It is best to feed your monkey on a regular schedule twice per day.</p><p>Capuchins also thrive with the occasional cooked meat treat (about 1 teaspoon), but never give them table food, dairy products, or sweets, as this is not part of their natural diet and can lead to health problems.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Capuchins, like other primates, can transmit certain diseases to humans, the most notable being hepatitis and rabies. Monkeys are also natural hosts of herpes B (or monkey B) virus, which can cause fatal encephalomyelitis in people. Monkeys commonly develop latent, lifelong infections that can be transmitted to people via scratches and bites.</p><p>Capuchins can become infected with common human ailments since their immune systems are not as robust as ours. Many pet capuchins develop diabetes due to improper nutrition. Like humans, your pet monkey should have regular blood screenings to monitor glucose and cholesterol levels closely.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Capuchin monkeys will need lots of physical and mental stimulation in order to thrive. They do not do well in small enclosures and will need amply space where they can run around, climb in trees and explore their territory.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Grooming your capuchin monkey can be a great opportunity for bonding and attention in the wild, the monkeys will groom each other as a sign of affection and respect, so similar feelings can be fostered through owner-to-monkey grooming.</p><p>Every month or so, wash your monkey with a mild shampoo designated for human hair, being careful not to get soap in their eyes. Rinse soap throughouhly, then dry your capuchin with a soft towel or hairdryer set to low heat.</p><h2>Training Your Capuchin Monkey </h2><p>Part of the difficulty (and issue) with owning a capuchin monkey comes from training. They are incredibly smart but also have their own ideas for how they want to learn (or not learn things), making it difficult to train them properly if you yourself are not trained and experienced in primate care. It is recommended that you seek out a kind and patient trainer skilled in primates to help you with your capuchin, whether that's training them to be on a leash or if you're hoping they'll do tricks.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Capuchin Monkey </h2><p>When it comes to owning a capuchin monkey, there are many aspects to consider before committing to primate ownership. Capuchin monkeys are charming and adorable creatures, but unless you're extremely well-versed in primate care, owning one may be more difficult (and potentially dangerous) than it is enjoyable.</p>",1211
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/african-dormice-as-pets-1236775,Small Pets > Pet Mice,<h1>Should You Keep an African Dormouse as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep an African Dormouse as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The African dormouse, also known as a micro squirrel, is a tiny rodent that looks a lot like a very small squirrel with some mouse-like features. These rodents are native to subtropical and tropical regions of eastern and southern Africa, and they're infrequently found in the exotic pet trade. Dormice are very active and nimble animals, making them difficult to handle. They need a large enclosure in which they can exercise, as well as a varied diet. Overall, they are fairly difficult to care for and require a knowledgeable and dedicated owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: African dormouse, woodland dormouse, African dwarf dormouse, African pygmy dormouse, micro squirrel</p> <p>Adult Size: 3 to 4 inches in body length, plus another few inches for the tail</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 to 6 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet African Dormouse? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>In 2003, the United States banned the importation of rodents from Africa, including the African dormouse, after an outbreak of the monkeypox virus was linked to African rodents. However, there are still some states that don't have explicit laws against keeping African dormice as pets, as long as they were bred in the U.S. Certain states do require permits to keep exotic animals. Plus, even if your state laws allow the animal as a pet, your local laws might prohibit it. Make sure to check any homeowners association or landlord rules regarding exotic pets, too.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>An African dormouse requires a great deal of care, so even if you can legally acquire and own one, it's important to consider if you should ethically own one. Like with all pets, you should make sure you have the resources and bandwidth to properly care for an African dormouse before pursuing ownership.</p><h2>African Dormouse Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>African dormice are social animals and should be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups. Territorial aggression sometimes can occur, but if your group is raised together from a young age, the dormice will typically coexist peacefully.These rodents are nocturnal and most active in the early mornings and late evenings. Dormice are generally quiet animals, though they do make some vocalizations that include a sharp barking noise when they feel threatened.</p><p>As pets, they tend to be shy and some might never become tame or comfortable around people. Regular handling from a young age is the best approach to end up with a pet that you can handle. To get a dormouse used to your presence, gently stroke its fur while it's in its enclosure, and offer it treats, such as pieces of fresh fruit. The next step is to hold it in your hands for increasing durations. Some dormice enjoy climbing on their owners, while others like to sit in a shirt pocket, which they see as a safe hiding spot. Still, dormice will bite if they feel threatened, so keep all of your movements slow and gentle around them.</p><p>A dormouse won't bond with you as a dog or cat would. However, they usually will become used to your presence and some will come up to the side of their enclosure to watch their owners. Keep any other pets in the household away from your dormouse to prevent any injuries to this tiny, fragile rodent. Expect to spend several hours per week on cleaning and ensuring that your rodent is eating a balanced diet, and aim to spend at least a few hours per day handling your dormouse to keep it tame.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>African dormice are excellent escape artists and can sneak through small openings, so the best type of housing is a glass or plastic tank with a tightly fitting fine mesh top. A 10-gallon tank is the minimum recommended size for two dormice. Because these are such active animals, it's ideal to get as large of a tank as you can fit and afford to give them plenty of room to move about and explore.</p><p>Because dormice naturally spend a lot of time in trees, it's a good idea to provide branches for climbing. You also can suspend cotton ropes and toys made out of wood and rope (look for parrot toys in the pet shop) from the top of the enclosure for climbing and play. A nest box or small animal hideout is another great addition and can be found at most pet stores (cardboard tubes also work well both for hiding and play). Add a small rodent wheel with a solid surface for exercise.</p><p>A room temperature that's at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit is suitable for dormice, and you should keep the tank away from drafts. Additionally, African dormice are also very sensitive to light, so keep their enclosure away from bright lights and windows.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Line your chosen enclosure with a few inches of bedding, such as a recycled paper product or aspen shavings. Avoid pine and cedar bedding, as these materials can irritate a rodent's respiratory system. Remove spots of soiled bedding daily, and plan to remove and replace all the bedding as well as clean all the surfaces in the enclosure with mild soap and water roughly every week.</p><h2>What Do African Dormice Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, dormice eat a varied diet that includes nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetation, bird eggs, and insects. Good variety seems to be the key to keeping dormice in captivity. The main part of your dormouse's diet should be a nut and seed mix, such as those made for hamsters and other small rodents. To supplement that, provide fresh fruits daily, such as pieces of apple, banana, and tomato. You should also offer protein sources, such as hard-boiled eggs, feeder insects (e.g., mealworms and crickets), and cooked chicken.</p><p>Put a day's worth of the nut and seed mix in a small bowl in your animal's enclosure for it to graze on throughout the day, and replace it with new food every 24 hours. You can do this at any point in the day that is convenient for you, but it's best to feed fresh foods at night in a separate bowl and remove any uneaten portions in the morning to prevent the food from spoiling. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate quantity and variety to feed your dormouse, as this can vary based on age, size, and activity level.</p><p>Always keep a source of fresh water in your animal's enclosure, and refresh it every day. Aim to train your dormouse to drink from a rodent water bottle that you attach to the side of the enclosure, as this is easier to keep sanitary than a water dish. However, don't remove its water dish until you're sure it's consistently drinking from the bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Before acquiring an African dormouse, make sure to find a vet near you who can treat this species. Dormice are generally hardy animals, but they are prone to some health issues.</p><p>A dormouse that is cold to the touch might be in torpor, a state of lowered physiological activity. The animal's body temperature and metabolic rate go down, which allows it to conserve energy. A habitat that's too cold, a lack of food, and stress all can cause a dormouse to go into torpor. While this state is sometimes necessary for survival in the wild, captive dormice kept in the proper conditions shouldn't have to enter it. Dormice can die in this state if they can't get their bodies warm again, so if your animal is cold, try cupping it in your hands to provide instant warmth. </p><p>Furthermore, one of the greatest threats to a captive dormouse's health is injury. Because they are quick, agile animals, they easily can escape a person handling them. This can lead to a damaging fall, the potential of being stepped on, and more. If you handle your pet, do so while sitting on the floor in a room with the door closed. This way, if your dormouse accidentally escapes your hands, you should be able to collect it again without injury.</p>",1324
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-and-caring-for-pet-mice-1236741,Small Pets > Pet Mice,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Mouse</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Mouse</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Pet mice are entertaining to watch, are easy to care for, and make very few demands on their owners. They are a bit skittish and harder to handle than some larger rodents, such as rats, but they can learn to be comfortable with handling, especially if tamed from a young age. Pet mice come in a wide array of colors with fairly short fur. Their rounded ears and long tail have minimal fur.Asnocturnal animals,micewill generally be most active at night and sleep through the day. In terms of their care, they require a quality rodent food and regular habitat cleanings.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Mouse, house mouse</p> <p>Adult Size: 5 to 7 inches long (including tail), weighing around 1 ounce</p><p>Lifespan: 1 to 3 years</p><h2>Mouse Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Mice are social animals and like living with members of their species. A pair of females is the easiest arrangement, though a small group of females is fine too if you provide the cage space. Do not let pairs of males live together unless they were littermates, never separated, and have a large enough cage that they can have their own space. Unfamiliar males are likely to fight. Also, avoid keeping males and females together unless you want lots of baby mice in a short amount of time.</p><p>Keep mice away from other household pets to avoid any stress and injury. But they can learn to be comfortable around humans, and many can become hand-tame. However, mice that are not accustomed to handling or mice that are not handled gently might bite. Inappropriate handling also can injure a mouse. For instance, a fall from even just a few feet can cause serious damage, as can holding a mouse by its tail. It is best to hold the mouse just above your lap or some other soft surface in case it escapes your hands.</p><p>Mice are quiet pets, though their nocturnal activities might keep you up if their enclosure is near your bed. Plan to spend a few hours per week on feedings and keeping the habitat clean.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About Mice as Pets</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Mice stretch around 5 to 7 inches long from nose to tail. Their bodies alone are roughly 3 inches long. And they weigh around an ounce. Mice reach maturity at about 2 months old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>The size of the cage you will need depends on how many mice you keep together. A 10-gallon aquarium with a secure mesh top or a similarly sized wire cage should be suitable for one to four mice. Wire cages offer better ventilation, though you must make sure the bar spacing is narrow enough that your mouse can't squeeze through. Horizontal bars, as well as cages with multiple levels, are ideal to provide climbing opportunities. Avoid cages with wire floors; solid flooring is a lot easier on the mice's feet.</p><p>Modular plastic cages meant for hamsters also can be suitable for mice. However, they often are challenging to clean and are sometimes poorly ventilated. A determined mouse might even chew through the plastic.</p> <p>Besides various toys, the habitat also should have a nest box or other type of shelter where the mice can go to feel secure. Keep the cage out of drafts and away from direct sunlight.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>On the floor of the habitat, add several inches ofaspen shavingsor undyed paper bedding. Avoid cedar and pine bedding due to their oils that can be harmful to mice. Also, offer nesting material, such as strips of facial tissue, paper towels, or hay. Clean out nesting material every month or two (frequent changes can be disruptive) unless it becomes soiled. Change the bedding and scrub the enclosure with mild soap and water weekly.</p><h3>Watch Now: Tips for Taking Care of a Pet Mouse</h3><h2>What Do Mice Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Mice should be fed a formulated rodent pellet that's around 16% protein, 18% fiber, and 4% fat. Follow the bag label for how much to feed, and verify that with your vet. Mice tend to graze during their waking hours (and might even wake up during their sleeping hours for a snack). So always keep a small ceramic bowl filled with a day's worth of food in their habitat. Throw away uneaten food after 24 hours, and replenish the bowl.</p><p>You can supplement your mouse's diet with seeds and grains, as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. Some options include broccoli, peas, apples, carrots, and cucumber. Consult your vet regarding the quantity and frequency of these supplemental foods, as this can vary based on a mouse's size and activity level. Place fresh foods in a separate dish from the pellets, and discard them after a few hours to prevent spoilage. The best time to feed is in the evening as the mouse is waking up and looking for food.</p><p>Also, always have fresh water available for your mouse. Using a water bottle attached to the enclosure is ideal, as it's easy to keep sanitary. But also keep a water dish in the enclosure until you're sure the mouse is using the bottle. Refresh the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Tumors are common in mice; usually, they are malignant and deadly. Signs include a visible lump or swelling accompanied by lethargy and/or weight loss. Some tumors can be surgically removed but are likely to recur.</p><p>Another severe and common health condition in mice and other pet rodents is wet tail, a gastrointestinal ailment caused by an overpopulation of bacteria in the digestive tract. It can progress quickly and be fatal if left untreated. Symptoms include diarrhea, lethargy, lack of appetite, and difficulty walking. An exotic animal veterinarian can treat the condition with antibiotics.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not every veterinarian is equipped to treat mice. So before bringing any home, make sure there is a vet near you who will take your mice on as patients.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>To begin taming your mice, spend time around their enclosure, so they become used to your presence. Offer some favorite treats (try millet or sunflower seeds) by hand. This often leads to the mice walking on your hands, and from there you can slowly pick them up. When picking up a mouse, try scooping it up by cupping your hand under the mouse, but do not squeeze or tightly grasp the mouse's body.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Mice need physical activity to help prevent obesity and other health issues. As long as you provide a large enough enclosure with an exercise wheel, they should be able to meet their activity needs. You also can give them out-of-cage time in a secure spot, such as a kiddie pool with sides too high for your mice to climb. Always monitor your mice when they're out of the enclosure.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Mice are quite clean animals that frequently groom themselves. They don't require baths. But occasionally they might need some help with their dental grooming. Mouse teeth grow continuously throughout their life, and they naturally wear them down by gnawing on their food and other objects. Sometimes, though, the teeth become overgrown and require trimming by a vet.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary ongoing costs for pet mice will be their food and bedding. On a monthly basis, plan to spend around $20 to $30. You'll also periodically have to replace chew toys and other worn items in the habitat, costing around $20 on average. Plus, be sure to budget for routine checkups and emergency veterinary care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Mouse as a Pet </h2><p>Mice are quiet pets, and they don't take up a lot of space. They're also social creatures who can learn to be comfortable with you handling them. However, they are fragile and require a gentle hand. Plus, they aren't very long-lived pets.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Mouse </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other small rodents that can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Mouse </h2><p>Mice commonly can be found at pet shops. However, it's often ideal to go to a reputable breeder or rescue organization. They typically can provide better information regarding their animals' health and history, and they might even handle their animals to tame them. Expect to pay between $5 and $10 on average, though this can vary based on factors such as the animal's age.</p>",1364

They are interesting to watch, take up relatively little space, and are fairly easy to maintain. However, tarantulas aren't the best choice if you want a pet you can handle, as they do have venomous bites.</p><p>There are around 1,000 species of tarantulas in the family. One of the more popular species kept as a pet is the Chilean rose , a hardy spider native to Chile that's generally easy to care for. As pets, tarantulas need housing that mimics their natural habitat, along with live prey.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Tarantula</p> <p>Adult Size: 5 to 8 inches long on average</p><p>Lifespan: 5 to 20 years on average (females generally live longer than males)</p><h2>Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The best tarantulas for beginners are typically the ground dwellers, such as the curly hair tarantula. They tend to move more slowly, which makes any necessary handling easier. The pink toe tarantula is often cited as a good tree-dwelling tarantula to keep,but it's not a good first tarantula overall. In general, tree-dwelling species are more challenging to care for because they're quick and agile, making handling difficult.</p><p>In general, tarantulas are solitary animals. And handling is not recommended except when necessary, such as moving the spider out of its enclosure for cleaning. In that case, it's best to coax the spider into a small container for transport, rather than moving it in your hands.</p><p>Tarantulas are generally docile, which is why some people do allow their spiders to walk on their bodies. However, tarantulas willbite if they feel threatened, and their bites are venomous. Another concern with handling tarantulas is skin irritation from tiny barbed hairs on their abdomens. If they feel threatened, the spiders can release these hairs, which work their way into your skin and cause itching and irritation.</p><p>Plus, if the hairs get into your eyes, they can cause serious inflammation. So be careful not to rub your eyes while doing anything with the spider and its enclosure, and wash your hands well afterward. Moreover, do not allow children and other pets to come in contact with the tarantula.</p><p>While their defense mechanisms somewhat complicate their overall ease of care, tarantulas are still fairly straightforward to maintain. And they're a good choice for people who want a quiet animal that doesn't require much attention. Expect to spend a few hours each week on feedings and cleaning. Then, you simply can enjoy observing this unique animal. A tarantula is generally at its most active when it's hunting live prey. Otherwise, it typically will spend a lot of time in a seemingly restful state.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Tarantulas have toxic venom that typically causes a local reaction similar to a bee sting. However, some people who are allergic to the venom can have more serious reactions and should seek immediate medical care.</p><h3>8 Tips for Keeping Tarantulas as Pets</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Tarantulas have a leg span between 5 and 8 inches long on average. The females are often larger than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Spiders are not social animals and generally should be housed one to a cage. They need a secure lid to their enclosure, as they can be escape artists, but the lid must also have ventilation.</p><p>For ground-dwelling tarantulas, the generalrule of thumb is the length of enclosure should be approximately three times the spider's leg span, and the width of the enclosure should be roughly double its leg span. The height only needs to be approximately the same as the spider's leg span. A 5-gallon aquarium often works well. And a larger tank isn't necessarily better, as it can make prey more difficult to find.</p><p>For tree-dwelling species, also choose an enclosure that's three times the leg span long and two times the leg span wide. The height should be roughly a foot. Include branches on which the spider can climb and construct its web.</p><p>Your tarantula also needs a place to hide. A piece of cork bark, a half hollow log (often available from pet stores), or half a clay flowerpot on its side are all good options.</p><p>Tarantulas don't need bright lights and should be kept out of direct sunlight. They also generally don't need heat lamps, as most species do fine at room temperature. Some species require high humidity levels, which you can achieve by misting the enclosure daily.</p><p>Spot clean the enclosure as needed, and remove uneaten food after 24 hours. It's generally recommended to do a full cleaning of the enclosure, including a change of the bedding, every four to six months.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Line the bottom of the enclosure with a layer of vermiculite, or vermiculite mixed with potting soil and/or peat, that's at least two to four inches deep to allow for burrowing.</p><h2>What Do Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Feed your tarantula a diet of crickets supplemented with other insects, including mealworms, super worms, and roaches. Large tarantulas can even be given pinkie mice and small lizards. The crickets should be gut loaded (fed nutritious foods) prior to feeding your tarantula and dusted with a vitamin powder. What goes into the cricket is what you're ultimately feeding your spider. In general, the size of the food should be smaller than the tarantula's body.</p><p>Adults can get feedings roughly once a week while juveniles can eat every day or two. Simply drop in the prey close to where your spider is in the enclosure. Feedings are best done in the evening when the spider is more active. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate quantity and variety to feed your spider, as this can vary based on age, size, and species.</p><p>A small dish of fresh water should be provided at all times. It must be very shallow to prevent drowning. You can place some pebbles in the dish to give the spider something to climb out on as a precaution.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Tarantulas are generally hardy animals and don't have many health problems as long as they are kept secure in the proper environment. However, they still might face some issues.</p><p>Some tarantulas might acquire oral nematodes, a parasitic infection, though this is not very common for captive tarantulas. Symptoms include decreased appetite and white material around the spider's mouth.</p><p>Furthermore, molting is how the spider grows to a larger size, by shedding its old exoskeleton and producing a new one. This is a stressful time for a spider, and it will typically lose its appetite prior to a molt. Don't feed the spider during the molting process, which can take several days. Live prey can injure the spider while its new exoskeleton is hardening. In addition, the spider should never be handled during the molting process. It can take up to two weeks for the spider to fully recover after molting.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians have experience with tarantulas. Make sure there is one nearby who can treat them before even acquiring a pet tarantula.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As with any animal, physical activity is important to keep tarantulas healthy and at a good weight. However, these spiders don't need very much exercise. As long as they have an enclosure that allows them sufficient space to move and climb, they should get the activity they require.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Molting is how tarantulas ""groom"" themselves, and they generally don't need any assistance from you. Just make sure their enclosure is at the proper humidity for their species, and keep live prey away from them until the molt is complete.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>On a monthly basis, your main cost for a tarantula will be its diet. This can range from around $5 to $10, and you can even decrease that cost if you raise crickets yourself rather than purchasing them from a pet store. For periodic substrate changes, expect to spend between $10 and $20. And make sure to budget for an annual veterinary wellness checkup, as well as emergency vet care.</p>",1304
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mongolian-gerbils-as-pets-1236822,Small Pets > Gerbils,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Gerbil</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Gerbil</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Gerbils are popular pets that are relatively inexpensive and easy to care for. They are burrowing rodents that come from Africa and Asia. While there are several species of gerbils in the wild, most pets are captive-bred Mongolian gerbils. In the wild, they have an overall grayish color. However, through selective breeding, several color variations are available, including white, black, and gold. As pets, many gerbils can become hand-tame through gentle handling. Their diet is fairly straightforward, and their housing setup is pretty easy to maintain.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Gerbil, Mongolian gerbil</p> <p>Adult Size: Roughly 4-inch body; tail adds another 4 inches</p><p>Lifespan: 2 to 3 years on average; can live up to 8 years</p><h2>Gerbil Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Unlike a mouse or hamster, gerbils can often be seen sitting up on their hind legs. They are quite curious, playful, and active animals, but they are still relatively quiet pets. They are not nocturnal, though they are sometimes active at night and might take naps during the day.</p><p>Gerbils live in colonies in the wild and are very social animals; they do not do well as a solitary pet. So keeping a same-sex pair is necessary. It's best to select littermates or young gerbils that can grow up together. However, if you have a single adult gerbil, it can be difficult to introduce a new one, as they are quite territorial. They often will fight, sometimes to the death of one of the gerbils. Moreover, gerbils should be kept away from other household pets to avoid potential stress and injury.</p><p>Being social creatures, gerbils can become quite tame around humans with regular gentle handling. They generally have an agreeable temperament and are only inclined to bite if they feel threatened. Hand-taming a gerbil is usually quite easy, especially when using positive reinforcement like treats. Expect to spend a few hours per day feeding your pet, keeping its environment clean, and interacting with it.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Gerbil bodies stretch around 4 inches long on average. The tail adds roughly another 4 inches. The males typically are slightly larger than the females.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Glass aquariums can be used for gerbil housing and are favored over wire cages by many owners. Aquariums allow for a deep layer of bedding, so the gerbils can engage in their natural burrowing behavior. A secure mesh lid is necessary to prevent escapes and to allow for good ventilation. As a general rule, there should be 5 gallons of space per gerbil.</p><p>Wire cages also can be used for gerbils, but gerbils do have a tendency to kick bedding through the wire bars and make a mess. Make sure the wires are narrow enough that the gerbil can't squeeze through but not too narrow that the gerbil might get its legs or other body parts stuck in them. Plastic cages shouldn't be used, as they don't hold up to the chewing habits of gerbils or provide adequate ventilation.</p><p>In the enclosure, provide lots of materials for climbing and enrichment, such as thick pieces of wood, stable large rocks, ladders, ramps, and platforms. Toys that are safe for chewing should always be available to help wear down a gerbil's continuously growing teeth. Wood toys made for small animals or even for birds are good options. Toilet paper tubes, though quickly destroyed, also are often a favorite gerbil toy.</p><p>Moreover, add an exercise wheelwith a solid surface to prevent injuries. There should be no place in the exercise wheel where your gerbil can get its feet, tail, or other body parts stuck.</p><p>Gerbils also need a nest box to feel secure. They will hide out in their nest box and use it for sleeping. A sturdy wood or ceramic nest box is preferable to plastic, as plastic will quickly be destroyed by chewing. Wood will likely get chewed as well but tends to last a little longer. Clay flower pots are another option to use as a gerbil nest box.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Add at least 2 inches of dye-free paper or aspen bedding to the bottom of the habitat. Avoid cedar or pine shavings, as they can be harmful to gerbils. Also, include materials your gerbil can shred for nesting, such as dye- and scent-free paper towels or tissue. Remove soiled spots in the bedding daily, and do a complete bedding change weekly when you wash down everything in the enclosure with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Gerbils Eat & Drink? </h2><p>The primary part of your gerbil's diet should be a formulated pelleted food, which should be available at all times. This will offer complete nutrition. Provide a day's worth of pellets in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure. Dispose of any uneaten pellets after 24 hours before adding the next day's portion.</p><p>You also can offer a dish of a gerbil food mix with seeds, grains, and dried veggies. But note that gerbils tend to gravitate toward the high-fat seeds first, especially sunflower seeds. So you might want to pick them out and offer them as occasional treats to make sure your gerbil isn't getting too much fat. Discuss the proper feeding amount with your vet, as this can vary by size and activity level.</p><p>Plus, offer small amounts of fresh veggies and fruits to a lesser extent, again discussing the quantity with your vet. Some good options include peas, broccoli, and apples. Put fresh foods in a separate dish, and remove them after a few hours to prevent spoilage. It's best to offer them at a time of day when your gerbil is most active.</p><p>Finally, gerbils should always have access to fresh water. It's best to use a water bottle that attaches to the enclosure side. But also include a water dish until you're sure your gerbil is using the bottle. Refresh the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Gerbils are usually healthy animals.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians accept gerbils as patients. So before acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet near you who specializes in gerbils.</p><h2>Training Your Gerbil </h2><p>Hand-taming is the most common training people do with their pet gerbils. Give your gerbil a few days to acclimate to its new home before handling it. When it appears comfortable, approach it calmly when it's awake.</p><p>Once your gerbil is comfortable with you, you can hold and carry your pet in your cupped hands. Many gerbils also enjoy having the sides and backs of their heads gently scratched. Avoid touching your gerbil's tail; if you are concerned that it might fall, you can quickly but gently grasp the scruff of its neck for repositioning.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Gerbils are very playful and need exercise to keep them mentally stimulated and physically fit helping to ward off diseases, such as obesity. Providing as large of an enclosure as you can fit and afford is one of the best ways to ensure they get enough exercise. Make sure they have enough climbing structures, an exercise wheel, toys, and other items to keep them busy. Also, allow them supervised out-of-cage time each day in a secure area where they can safely run and explore.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Gerbils regularly self-groom, and they even might groom cage mates as a way of bonding. Gerbils don't need baths. But if they get something stuck in their fur, you can help get it out by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary ongoing costs for a pet gerbil will be its food and bedding. Expect to spend around $15 per month on average, depending on the varieties you choose and how big the habitat is. Other periodic costs will involve replacing worn toys and other items in the enclosure, averaging around $10 to $20. Also, make sure to budget for routine vet care and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Gerbil as a Pet </h2><p>Gerbils are mostly quiet pets that don't require a lot of space. They can be quite entertaining to watch and typically can be hand-tamed. However, they must be handled very gently and aren't ideal for young children. They also can be a bit messy with their bedding.</p>",1341

Teddy guinea pigs are a specific breed with coarse, short fur that doesn't require much grooming. They are slightly smaller than the main species and tend to be very friendly and docile.They require a moderate amount of care, though it is fairly straightforward. Their housing is relatively easy to set up, and their diet should be available at most pet stores.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Teddy guinea pig, teddy bear guinea pig, teddy cavy, teddy bear cavy</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size: 10 to 12 inches long, weighing 1.5 to 3 pounds on average</p><p>Lifespan:4 to 8 years</p><h2>Teddy Guinea Pig Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Teddy guinea pigs generally spend their days playing, eating, and sleeping. They're most active during the day but also sometimes move around at night. Guinea pigs are social animals and should ideally be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups. Keeping females together is the better option, as males sometimes will fight. Moreover, keep your guinea pigs away from other household pets to avoid any stress and injuries.</p><p>Guinea pigs also typically enjoy interaction with people, especially when handled from a young age. They can be skittish at first, though they are usually not aggressive and rarely bite. They'll generally bond with the people who care for them the most, and many come to enjoy petting, being held, and cuddling with their owners. They also might squeal with excitement when they see their favorite people.</p><p>They are largely quiet animals, but they do have a range of vocalizations that they use to communicate their moods. For instance, they might make a purring sound when they're content.</p><p>Plan to spend a few hours each day giving your guinea pig attention and letting it out of its enclosure for exercise and mental stimulation. In addition to daily feedings, you'll also have to allot some time each week to clean the enclosure.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Teddy guinea pigs stretch around 10 to 12 inches long on average and weigh between roughly 1.5 and 3 pounds. The females are usually slightly smaller than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>As a general rule, guinea pigs should have as large of a cage as you can fit and afford. Remember this will be their primary area for exercise unless you're able to let your guinea pig out of its cage and safely monitor it for most of the day.</p><p>A cage for one guinea pig should be at least 30 by 36 inches. For two guinea pigs you'll need one that's at least 30 by 50 inches. Guinea pigs typically don't climb, so a height of around 18 inches should be fine. Cages with a plastic base and wire walls and top are ideal because they allow for good air flow. Just make sure the flooring is not wire, as this can harm a guinea pig's feet.</p><p>Within the cage should be a nest or some other type of guinea pig-sized shelter, which you can find at many pet stores. Also, include some guinea pig toys for play and chewing.</p><p>Keep your guinea pig's habitat away from drafts and direct sunlight. Also, don't put it in a high-traffic area with lots of movement and loud noises, as this can be stressful.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Add around 2 inches of dye-free paper bedding to the bottom of the enclsoure. Avoid pine and cedar beddings, as they can be harmful to a teddy guinea pig's respiratory tract. Change the bedding weekly when you wash down the cage with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Teddy Guinea Pigs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Teddy guinea pigs eat a plant-based diet. Provide an unlimited amount of timothy hay every day. This aids digestion and helps to wear down their continuously growing teeth. You can use a special feeder called a hayrack in the enclosure or simply lay the hay somewhere accessible.</p><p>Then, feed a commercial pelleted guinea pig diet. Make sure the pellets are fortified with vitamin C, as guinea pigs can't produce that on their own. Follow the package label for how much to feed, and confirm that with your vet. Fill a small ceramic bowl with a day's worth of pellets in the morning, and then dispose of any eaten food the next morning before that day's feeding.</p><p>You can offer fresh fruits and vegetables to supplement the hay and pellets. Consult your vet for the proper quantity, as this can vary based on such factors as size, age, and activity level. Some options include kale, carrots, zucchini, and blueberries.</p><p>Finally, always provide clean water for your guinea pig. Using a water bottle attached to the enclsoure is best, as it's easy to keep sanitary. But until you're sure your guinea pig is drinking from the bottle, also include a small water dish. Refresh the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians take guinea pigs as patients. So as you consider one as a pet, be sure to find a vet nearby who treats guinea pigs.</p><h2>Training </h2><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Some guinea pigs can learn to use a litter box with some training. Select a litter box that your guinea pig can easily get in and out of, and fill it with a different bedding from what you have in the rest of the enclosure. If possible, add some soiled bedding as well. Position the litter box in a spot where your guinea pig often receives itself. Treat it whenever you see it exploring the box and anytime you catch it relieving itself in the box.</p><p>If your guinea pig instead picks a new spot to relieve itself, try moving the box there. You also can get a second box if your enclosure has the space. While there are no guarantees to this process, eventually your guinea pig might come to see the box as its toilet.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Daily exercise is essential to help prevent obesity and other health issues in teddy guinea pigs. Let your guinea pig out of its enclsoure for at least a few hours a day to explore in a secure room. Make sure to keep cords and other potentially hazardous objects out of its reach, and always supervise it outside of the enclosure.</p><p>Also, to prevent your guinea pig from getting lazy, it can be helpful to put its food and its sleeping area on opposite sides of its habitat. That way, it has to get up and move around whenever it wants a bite to eat. Cages with multiple levels accessible via solid-floor ramps also are helpful to promote physical activity.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Brush teddy guinea pigs weekly with a stiff brush or comb. Hair trimming typically won't be necessary thanks to their short coat. Their hair should be plush and a little coarse when well groomed. Guinea pigs also periodically need nail trims, as they don't naturally wear down their nails like they would in the wild. Your vet can show you how to properly trim nails.</p><p>Baths typically aren't necessary for guinea pigs unless they have skin problems (such as parasites) or get something embedded in their fur.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary regular costs for a teddy guinea pig will be its food and bedding. Each month, plan to spend around $40, though this can vary based on the varieties you choose, how large your enclosure is, and how many guinea pigs you have. You'll also have to occasionally replace worn items in the enclosure, such as nests and toys, which cost around $10 to $20 on average. In addition, always make sure to budget for routine and emergency veterinary care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Teddy Guinea Pig as a Pet </h2><p>Teddy guinea pigs can make for adorable, friendly, entertaining, and cuddly pets. They also are fairly quiet and don't take up a lot of space. However, because they are social animals, it is best to have more than one, which adds to their care and cost. Plus, they are prone to a variety of health issues and need a vet who specializes in them.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Teddy Guinea Pig </h2> ",1348
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pinktoe-tarantulas-as-pets-1237354,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Pink Toe Tarantula</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Pink Toe Tarantula</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>A spider's quiet demeanor, minimal space requirements, and relative ease of care can make it a great option for an exotic pet. Pink toe tarantulas, sometimes referred to as Antillestree spiders, get their name from their pinkish-orange toes that sprout off of furry black legs. Native to South America, these fast-moving, agile creatures live in trees where they spin elaborate webs. As pets, they require housing that mimics their natural habitat, along with live prey. And though some people do handle their spiders, these animals are more for your enjoyment as you watch their interesting behaviors.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pink toe tarantula, Antillestree spider</p> <p>Adult Size: Leg span of 3.5 to 5 inches</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 10 years in captivity (females generally live longer than males)</p><h2>Pink Toe Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>As pets, pink toe tarantulas are quiet animals and will spend much of their time sitting in a restful state in their enclosure. In general, the most activity you'll see from them is when they're hunting their live prey, such as crickets, at feeding time. Expect to spend a few hours each week on feedings and keeping the enclosure clean.</p><p>These tarantulas can share an enclosure with others of the same species, though they don't necessarily need the company. Solitary housing removes the threat of cannibalism, a situation that can occur when the spiders are living in tight quarters or are otherwise stressed. Likewise, it's best to keep your tarantula away from any other pets in the household, as they could injure one another.</p><p>While some owners prefer not to handle their spiders, others enjoy it. And if you do it calmly and gently, the spider typically won't mind sitting on your hand or arm. However, pink toe tarantulas do tend to be skittish and might try to jump out of your hands if they're startled. This is why it's important to handle your spider while sitting on the ground. If it does accidentally fall, it will be less likely to get hurt. A fall from just a few feet can cause serious injury or even be fatal to a spider. Moreover, a pink toe tarantula might bite if it feels threatened.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>The spider does have toxic venom that typically causes a local reaction similar to a bee sting. However, some people who are allergic to the venom can have more serious reactions and should seek immediate medical care.</p><h3>8 Tips for Keeping Tarantulas as Pets</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>The pink toe tarantula stretches around 3.5 to 5 inches across. The females are slightly larger than males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>An enclosure with some height is necessary for these tree-dwelling spiders. A 10-gallon tank with a secure side opening can work well. Because pink toe tarantulas spin their webs up high, the side opening prevents damage to the web any time you need to open the enclosure for feedings or cleaning.</p><p>Pink toes can tolerate a wide temperature range from around 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. However, ideally the enclosure temperature should be between 78 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Under-tank heaters and reptile heat lights can provide the correct amount of ambient heat. Monitor the temperature with a thermometer in the tank.</p><p>In the wild, pink toes live in humid climates, so it's important to maintain a humidity level between 65 percent and 75 percent in your spider's enclosure. In fact, keeping the humidity level high can be one of the most difficult parts of having a pink toe tarantula. To raise humidity, you can add a sponge soaked in water to the bottom of the enclosure, as well as mist the enclosure every two to three days with clean water in a spray bottle. Not only will this provide humidity for your pet, but it also will benefit any live plants in the enclosure.Monitor the humidity level with a hygrometer.</p><p>To keep the enclosure clean, remove any uneaten prey after 24 hours. Also, monitor for mold growth, which can occur in a humid environment. Immediately remove any portions of the peat moss or soil bedding that start to grow mold. And expect to do a full change of the bedding roughly every four to six months.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The tank should contain 2 to 3 inches of peat moss or soil (free of fertilizers and pesticides) at the bottom, as well as small logs, branches, and live plants for climbing. Peruse pet stores for reptile and bird accessories especially the natural branches as these often work well for pet tarantulas to climb on.</p><h2>What Do Pink Toe Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Spiders love crickets and other insects, making pet ownership a two-part project because you'll need to keep and feed live crickets alongside your arachnid (unless you purchase them regularly). The crickets should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious foods) prior to giving them to your spider.</p><p>Dropping live prey into the bottom of the enclosure should whet your spider's appetite, whereas the spider might ignore dead insects. Adult pink toes generally eat a few crickets every three to 10 days, and young spiders need similar nourishment every two to five days. You also can give an adult tarantula the occasional pinky mouse or small lizard as a treat. Be sure to consult your veterinarian for the appropriate amount and variety to feed your particular animal.</p><p>It's recommended to feed a tarantula in the evening when it's more active and ready to eat. Leave the prey in the enclosure overnight, but be sure to remove anything that is uneaten within 24 hours. Prey left in the enclosure that your tarantula doesn't want can actually stress the spider.</p><p>Finally, your tarantula's habitat must always have a clean water source. Place a few small, shallow water bowls throughout the enclosure, and wash and refill them daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Tarantulas are generally hardy animals that don't face many health problems in captivity. But you still should monitor for any changes in behavior, such as lethargy, loss of appetite, or pacing in the enclosure. These can indicate a potential health issue, and you should consult a veterinarian who specializes in tarantulas as soon as possible.</p><p>Some owners mistake the spider's molting cycle for sickness. Molting takes place when a spider sheds its exoskeleton to form a new one. Before a molt, a spider might lose its appetite and seem a little sluggish and dull. Many spiders molt while lying on their backs with their legs curled up, which can alarm owners who aren't familiar with the process. The actual molt only takes a few hours, but then the new exoskeleton needs time to harden and become protective. The whole process is typically over in a few weeks, and your spider should resume its normal behavior. If it hasn't, or if the molt seems to be more difficult or taking longer than normal, consult your veterinarian.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Before even acquiring a pink toe as a pet, make sure there's a vet nearby who specializes in this animal.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Just like with any animal, physical activity is essential for a tarantula to help prevent obesity and other diseases. However, tarantulas don't need an excessive amount of exercise. As long as you provide them with a large enough enclosure, they should get the activity they require.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Pink toe tarantulas don't require any special grooming. Molting is the main way they ""groom"" themselves. Ensuring that the tank is at the proper temperature and humidity can help the spider go through a successful molt. Also, make sure there is no live prey in the tank during a molt, as it can damage the soft, vulnerable new exoskeleton.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>The primary monthly cost for your tarantula will be its diet, which ranges between $5 and $10 on average or potentially cheaper if you raise your own crickets instead of purchasing them at a pet store. Other than that, you might need to spend roughly $10 to $20 to refresh the substrate periodically. And you should budget for an annual veterinary checkup, as well as emergency medical care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Pink Toe Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Pink toe tarantulas are low-maintenance and interesting pets to keep. They also require minimal space, and they are quiet. However, they're not a cuddly pet. And they're not incredibly active for those who want a lot of excitement from a pet.</p><h2>Similar Spiders to the Pink Toe Tarantula </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other tarantulas that can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Pink Toe Tarantula </h2><p>You might not find a pink toe at a typical pet store. So instead look for a reputable breeder or exotic pet rescue organization. Expect to pay between $20 and $40 on average, though this can vary based on factors such as the animal's age.</p>",1444
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-sloths-1239558,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Sloth as a Pet? </h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Sloth as a Pet? </h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Two-toed sloths can legally be owned as exotic pets in some states, but they require a great deal of specialized care and are not particularly friendly. These slow-moving creatures need specific pellet foods as well as lots of fresh vegetables to eat. They also need trees to climb since sloths spend almost all of their time hanging from branches. Pet sloths prefer hanging around in trees much more than hanging out with people. They don't like to be cuddled, petted, or held. What's more, sloths can live up to 30 years, so a prospective pet owner must make a long-term commitment to fulfilling the unique needs of a sloth.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Two-toed sloth</p><p>Scientific Names:(Linnaeus's two-toed sloth) and (Hoffmann's two-toed sloth)</p><p>Adult Size: up to 2 feet from head to toe; up to 17 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: more than 30 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Sloth? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>As of 2022, it is legal to own a two-toed pet sloth in Alabama, Florida (with a permit), Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota (with health certificate), and Texas. Other states may allow sloths, but their state laws do not explicitly state it. Some laws ban boarding sloths, crossing state lines with them, and other restrictions. Contact your state and local officials to verify if it is legal for you to own, board, or transport a two-toed sloth where you live.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Wild mammals like sloths rarely fare as well in captivity as they do in the wild because it is impossible to replicate every aspect of their natural environment in captivity. Therefore, owning a sloth has the inherent risk of being harmful to the animal in terms of health or general well-being. Sloths, by nature, do not communicate in ways that are easily interpreted by humans, so it is difficult to recognize signs of stress or displease. This makes ownership challenging for even the most conscientious person. While it may not constitute outright cruelty, owning a sloth is not entirely ethical.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>The illegal pet trade also captures wild sloths for sale, which is unlawful and highly unethical, so you should seek a reputable source when purchasing a sloth. Three-toed sloths are often sold illegally, and they do not adapt well to life in captivity where they are likely to die.</p><h2>Sloth Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Sloths are wild animals that are mostly nocturnal in their natural habitats, but captive sloths may change their schedule and stay awake more during daylight hours.</p><p>These slow-moving animals do not like being petted, groomed, or bathed. Unlike most other animals, they do not show obvious external signs of stress. Instead, their instinctual response to perceived danger is to remain still. As a result, it can be difficult to tell when a sloth is scared or agitated. In some cases, if a sloth feels threatened, it will use its sharp claws and teeth and can cause serious injury. This can happen in captivity when humans or other pets behave aggressively.</p><p>Sloths are naturally quiet animals. They hardly make a noise. They don't move quickly, either. Their limbs are adapted for grasping, hanging, and climbing-not walking or running. They can cling to tree trunks or hang upside down from branches without effort but crawl clumsily (and very slowly) on the ground. They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to 40 minutes.</p><h3>How to Create a Happy Home for Your Sloth</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>In the wild, two-toed sloths spend all their time in tall trees. In captivity, they need plenty of trees or structures to spend their day hanging from. While they pose little danger to people or pets who keep their distance, sloths can easily be hurt, so they should be kept in a secure enclosure for their protection.</p><p>Within a sloth's enclosure, position climbing logs, poles, and branches for climbing within reach of each other. Sloths do not jump between treeslike lemurs and monkeys.</p><p>Sloths naturally live in the rainforests of Central and South America where it is very hot and humid. In captivity, they need the same climate conditions to thrive. People use heaters and humidifiers to recreate a tropical atmosphere of about 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit with 80 to 90% humidity. Sloths that remain too cold for too long will experience a drop in body temperature, and their digestive system will shut down. You can take your sloth out of its makeshift rainforest-like room for short periods, but it must go back to its room most of the time, including sleeping hours.</p><h2>What Do Sloths Eat and Drink? </h2><p>One of the hardest parts of owning an exotic pet like a sloth is trying to replicate its natural diet in captivity. Sloths eat leaves, mainly those found on the trees of Central and South America. They sleep about 20 hours a day and usually forage for food at night, so offer food every night. Feed a ""leaf eater food"" such as Marion Leaf Eater pellet food or Mazuri High Fiber Sticks, which zoos feed their sloths. In addition to the pellets, offer lettuces, dandelion greens, carrots, apples, green beans, sweet potatoes, and an occasional grape as a treat. You cannot feed leaves off the trees in your backyard to your pet sloth, and always avoid leaves with pesticides or chemicals on them.</p><p>In the wild, sloths get their water from dew on leaves or water contained in their food. In captivity, secure water and feeding bowls high up in the enclosure as well as on the ground. Also, strap big lettuce leaves and greens around the enclosure and on branches where the sloth likes to hang out.</p><p>A sloth's metabolism is so slow that it can take up to three weeks or one month to digest food. They pee and poop about once a week.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Before purchasing a sloth, find an exotic animal veterinarian in your area who has the expertise to treat this unusual pet. Sloths in captivity are susceptible to nutritional deficiencies, digestive disturbances, respiratory problems, and physical injuries. Dietary issues are the most prevalent issue since it is quite challenging to replicate a sloth's natural diet in captivity.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Sloths do not need any more exercise than they naturally get in the wild, which means they simply need trees or structures to climb and hang on. In the rainforest, sloths climb very tall trees, so if you have the room, consider giving your pet a high ceiling with tall features to climb. Their slow movements and equally slow metabolism make sloths a low-maintenance pet when it comes to exercise.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Sloths do not like to be touched much, and they do not need to be bathed. Trying to wash a sloth will only stress your pet, and their fur maintains a naturally balanced cleanliness thanks to the microorganisms that live in the sloth's coat. When it comes to their long claws, clipping is not an option. Unlike dogs and cats, you can't just clip a sloth's sharp claws to prevent it from scratching; sloths need their claws to grip onto trees and move naturally. Clipping a sloth's claws could prevent it from using its body properly, and the animal's physical and mental health could suffer as a result.</p>",1208
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchillas-1236769,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chinchilla</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chinchilla</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Chinchillas are small rodents native to rocky, arid regions in South America. They are typically active and playful as pets. And, with gentle handling from a young age, most chinchillas can become quite tame and bond closely with their owners. But don't expect them to like being held and cuddled like many dogs and cats. They usually don't, though they'll often express their affection for you in other ways. Pet chinchillas require a moderate amount of care, as they have some specific housing and dietary needs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Chinchilla, long-tailed chinchilla</p> <p>Adult Size: 9- to 14-inch body, tailadds another 3 to 6 inches</p><p>Lifespan:10+ years</p><h2>Chinchilla Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Chinchillas are largely nocturnal, which means they will be most active at night. Sometimes they are called ""crepuscular,"" meaning their activity peaks at dawn and dusk. In any case, they should be kept in a fairly quiet area during the day. And while they are mostly quiet animals, their nighttime movements might keep some people awake if their enclosure is close to your bed.</p><p>Pet chinchillas don't often bite, especially when they are handled from a young age. You must be gentle and consistent to gain the trust of a chinchilla. It can take some time to get a chinchilla used to your hands. And some chinchillas will never really like to be held much. They'd rather be exploring, or they might prefer to climb on you rather than being restrained. But by moving slowly and being patient, you often can get even the timidest chinchilla used to handling.</p><p>Chinchillas can be kept singly and will usually do fine in same-sex pairs, especially if the two chinchillas are littermates or are introduced at a young age. Keep chinchillas away from other household pets to avoid any stress or injuries.</p><h3>Watch Now: Are Chinchillas Good Pets?</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Chinchillas usually stretch around 9 to 14 inches long with their tail adding a few more inches. They typically weigh less than 2 pounds, with the females being slightly larger than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Chinchillas are perhaps best known for their incredibly soft, thick, luxurious fur. In the wild, this fur protects them from the elements. But in captivity, it makes them somewhat susceptible to overheating. This must be considered when deciding where to place your chinchilla in the house. The temperature should remain between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. While chinchillas are tolerant to cold, heat stroke can occur in warmer temperatures.</p><p>For your chinchilla's cage, choose a multilevel home with platforms, solid-floor ramps, and perches. The cage at minimum should be 4 feet by 4 feet by 3 feet. But the larger the cage, the better. Wire cages are the best material to allow for ventilation. Choose one with a solid floor that's easy on chinchilla feet.</p><p>Within the cage, add a chinchilla exercise wheel (with solid flooring, not bars), pet-safe chew toys, a nest or shelter of some sort, and food and water dishes.In addition, a ""chinchilla block"" or pumice block can be provided for chewing, and this will aid in keeping the chinchilla's teeth in good condition.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Line the cage with a few inches of dye-free paper bedding. Avoid pine and cedar shavings, as they can irritate a chinchilla's respiratory tract. Spot-clean soiled bedding daily, and do a full bedding change weekly when you wash everything in the enclosure with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Chinchillas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Chinchillas are herbivores and have specific dietary requirements. They require a lot of roughage, so their diet should mainly consist of good-quality grass hay, such as timothy hay. Feed an unlimited amount of hay each day, making sure some is always available. You can use a special hay feeder called a hopper, or simply pile it on the enclosure floor.</p><p>To supplement the hay, offer a commercial pelleted chinchilla food. Discuss the best quantity with your vet, as this can vary based on factors such as size and activity level. Place a day's worth of pellets in a ceramic bowl in the chinchilla's enclosure. Dispose of any uneaten pellets after 24 hours before adding the next day's portion.</p><p>You also can offer certain fruits and veggies as occasional treats, but you should run the types of food and quantities by your vet first. Place any fresh food in a separate dish in the enclosure, and remove it after a few hours to prevent spoilage.</p><p>Finally, always have fresh water available to your chinchilla. You can use a small water dish, but a water bottle is easier to keep sanitary. However, make sure the chinchilla is using the bottle before removing the dish. Refresh the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <p>If your chinchilla is showing signs of illness, immediately consult a veterinarian. Meanwhile, keep it in a quiet spot and avoid handling it to reduce stress.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians take chinchillas as patients. So before acquiring one, make sure there's a vet near you who specializes in this animal.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>The most common training people do with chinchillas is hand-taming. To do so, always move slowly around your chinchilla, as sudden movements can startle it. You can attract it to your hands by holding a favorite treat. Get your chinchilla accustomed to gentle petting before attempting to pick it up. To attempt picking it up, let it walk onto your hands. (It helps if you're holding a treat.) Then, carefully lift it with both hands, so it feels secure.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Chinchillas need lots of activity to keep them mentally stimulated and physically fit, warding off health issues such as obesity. This means you'll need a variety of toys for chinchillas to keep them busy and active. And you'll especially need safe items for chewing to wear down their continuously growing teeth. Besides toys marketed specifically for chinchillas, some wooden parrot toys also are good for them, as are the willow balls and rings that you often can find for rabbits. Make sure the toys don't have small and/or plastic parts that could be ingested.</p><p>Moreover, exercise wheels can be excellent for chinchillas to burn some energy. Look for a 15-inch wheel (anything smaller will be too small for mostadult chinchillas) with a solid running surface and an open side with no cross supports as there are in wire wheels, which can be dangerous to feet and tails.</p><p>Out-of-cage time also is key for exercise. However, avoid the plastic exercise balls that you often see for other small animals, such as hamsters, as these pose an overheating risk for chinchillas. Instead, chinchilla-proof a small room by removing electrical cords and other hazardous items, and allow your chinchilla to explore the space under your supervision ideally for a few hours per day.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Chinchillas should never be bathed in water. As natives of arid climates, chinchillas need access to a dust bath to maintain a healthy coat and skin. The sand mixture absorbs excess oils and removes dirt. Purchase commercial chinchilla dust, and add a couple of inches to a container that your chinchilla can easily fit in. Place the container in the enclosure for about 10 to 15 minutes per day. Change the dust weekly to keep it sanitary.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>The primary regular costs for a chinchilla will be its diet and bedding. Expect to pay around $25 per month, depending on the varieties you choose and how large your enclosure is. You'll also regularly have to replace chew toys and other worn items at a cost of around $10 to $20. Plus, be sure to budget for routine veterinary care and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Chinchilla as a Pet </h2><p>Chinchillas are interesting pets that can be entertaining to watch and friendly when properly socialized. They're also fairly quiet and don't take up a lot of space. However, many chinchillas do require lots of patience and effort when it comes to taming them. And they sleep during the day, so they wouldn't be a good companion for someone who wants to interact with a pet during the daylight hours.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Chinchilla </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other exotic animals that can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Chinchilla </h2><p>You can find chinchillas at many pet stores. However, it's typically better to acquire one from a reputable breeder or rescue group. They often have better information on the animal's health, history, and temperament. Expect to pay between $50 and $200 on average, though this can vary depending on factors such as the animal's age.</p>",1407
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mexican-redleg-tarantulas-as-pets-1237352,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Mexican Redleg Tarantula</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Mexican Redleg Tarantula</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The Mexican redleg tarantula, also known as the red-legged tarantula, is a large, ground-dwelling spider that's native primarily to western Mexico. It's closely related to the Mexican red-knee tarantula. Mexican redleg tarantulas have a dark abdomen, and the second joint of their legs is a reddish color hence their name. As pets, they are known for being easygoing spiders, and they are relatively easy to care for. Their housing takes up minimal space, and their diet is fairly straightforward.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Mexican redleg tarantula, red-legged tarantula</p> <p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 inches across</p><p>Lifespan: 5 years (males), up to 30 years (females)</p><h2>Mexican Redleg Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Mexican redleg tarantulas are one of the most docile spiders in the pet trade, which is why they are quite popular among arachnid keepers. These spiders rarely bite, though it's important to note their bite is venomous. And like other tarantulas, they possess urticating hairs, or sharp bristles, on their abdomens that they can flick at a perceived attacker if they feel threatened. These hairs can cause pain, inflammation, and rashes on a person's skin, and they can do serious damage if they get in your eyes.So it's important to wash your hands well after handling your spider or anything in its environment.</p><p>These spiders don't need socialization with humans or other animals. But thanks to their docile demeanor, many Mexican redleg tarantulas are relatively calm when being handled. If you wish to handle your spider, do so gently and carefully. And keep the handling sessions short to avoid causing any stress to the spider. It's ideal to sit on the floor when handling, as an accidental fall from even a few feet can seriously injure a spider.Moreover, keep any other household pets away from your tarantula to avoid potential injuries.</p><p>Mexican redleg tarantulas can be an excellent choice if you're looking for a pet that is quiet and doesn't require lots of attention. Plan to spend a few hours per week on feedings and cleaning. Otherwise, you simply can enjoy watching this interesting animal. Tarantulas mostly maintain a restful demeanor except for when they are hunting their prey. When they hunt, they might follow the prey around for a little while before pouncing. Or they might hold still and then quickly pounce once the prey crosses in front of them.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Mexican redleg tarantula bites are venomous. The venom typically causes a local reaction similar to a bee sting, but some people with allergies can have more serious reactions and should seek immediate medical care.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Mexican redleg tarantulas generally have a leg span of 5 to 6 inches across. The females tend to be slightly larger than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Tarantulas aren't social creatures, so they typically should be housed alone in their enclosure. A 5- to 10-gallon aquarium works well for a Mexican redleg tarantula. The width should be two to three times the spider's leg span, and the length should be three times the leg span. A height of around a foot is fine, as these spiders generally don't climb. A larger tank isn't necessarily better, as this can make it difficult for the spider to find its prey. Make sure the tank has a securely fitting screen top for airflow.</p><p>In the tank, add pieces of wood or cork bark, a half hollow log (often available at pet stores), half of a small clay flower pot, or other materials that could work as a hideout for your spider.</p><p>The tank humidity level should be around 65% to 70%, which can be measured with a hygrometer. If necessary, you can raise humidity by spraying the tank with clean water from a spray bottle.</p><p>Moreover, the tank temperature should be around 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 30 degrees Celsius). It's ideal to create a thermal gradient in the tank with one side that's warmer than the other. To achieve this, place a heat mat or ceramic heat emitter on one side of the tank, keeping that side around 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Regularly measure the tank temperature with a thermometer.</p><p>In general, plan to do a full cleaning of the enclosure every four to six months where you change all the bedding and wipe down the surfaces with mild soap and water. Also, make sure to remove any uneaten food within 24 hours to help keep the environment sanitary.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Because these spiders like to burrow, provide 4 to 6 inches of peat moss, chemical-free soil, or vermiculite as bedding on the bottom of the tank.</p><h2>What Do Mexican Redleg Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Live crickets will typically be the primary food in your pet Mexican redleg's diet. But these spiders also can eat mealworms, waxworms, roaches, and other insects. And adults can have the occasional pinkie mouse. The general rule is the size of the food should be smaller than the tarantula's body.</p><p>Most owners feed their Mexican redlegs twice a week simply by dropping the prey into the tank near the spider. It's often best to feed in the evening when the spider is more active. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate quantity and variety to feed your spider, as this can vary with age and size.</p><p>Also, always provide a small, shallow dish of water in your spider's enclosure that you refresh daily. Make sure your spider can easily get in and out of the dish to prevent drowning.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Tarantulas are typically hardy pets that rarely display health problems when kept in the proper environment. In fact, one of the biggest threats to their health is an accidental fall from a great height. A fall can cause serious internal injuries and often ends up being fatal. So this is why it's critical that your spider's tank has a secure lid and that you are very careful with handling.</p><p>Like other tarantulas, Mexican redlegs will go through molts shedding their old exoskeleton and growing a new one. This is a stressful process that can take several weeks to complete. Your spider likely will lose its appetite prior to molting, and during the process, it might roll onto its back with its legs curled up. Don't feed your spider during the molting process, as live prey can injure it while its new exoskeleton is hardening. Also, don't handle the spider during this time. Wait until your spider is acting normal again before resuming its regular routine. In adult tarantulas, molting generally takes place annually. However, Mexican redlegs have been known to miss molts, which is typically not a cause for concern.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Before even acquiring a Mexican redleg tarantula as a pet, make sure there's a veterinarian nearby who specializes in this animal.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like any animal, tarantulas do need some physical activity to stay at a good weight and remain healthy overall. As long as they have an enclosure that gives them sufficient space to move around, they should get all the exercise they need.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Molting is essentially how Mexican redlegs groom themselves. They typically don't require any help from you outside of making sure their environment is at the right temperature and humidity level and keeping live prey away from them.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>On a monthly basis, your primary cost for a Mexican redleg will be its diet. Expect to spend between $5 and $10 on average. You can even save some money by raising crickets yourself to feed your spider, rather than purchasing them from a pet store. Periodic substrate changes can range between $10 and $20. Also, make sure to budget for veterinary care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Mexican Redleg Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Mexican redlegs make for interesting pets. They're quiet, and they don't take up a lot of space. Plus, they don't require an excessive amount of maintenance. But if you want a cuddly or a very active pet, they probably aren't right for you.</p><h2>Similar Tarantulas to the Mexican Redleg </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother tarantulasthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Mexican Redleg Tarantula </h2><p>Due to their popularity as pet tarantulas, it's fairly easy to find Mexican redlegs. Look for a reputable breeder or rescue organization, which should be able to give you information about the animal's history and health. That way, you can be fairly certain you won't be bringing home a sick or pregnant spider. Expect to pay around $100 to $200 on average, though this can vary based on factors such as the animal's age and sex.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>A local exotic animal veterinarian might be able to recommend a good seller. The main benefit of going to a breeder is it often will have a wider selection of younger animals. Make sure the seller can give you thorough information on the spider's origin, age, sex, and health. When selecting a spider, avoid any that appear hunched, look shriveled, or have their legs curled under them. Ask to see the spider eat if possible. It should move quickly when hunting its prey. To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, house your spiders individually.</p><p>Mexican redlegs can be interesting pets for kids to keep, as long as they remain out of reach of children who don't understand their handling.</p><p>Mexican redlegs are fairly easy to maintain, with their primary needs revolving around regular feedings and periodic cleanings.</p><p>Some Mexican redlegs can be comfortable with gentle handling, though they never will become truly tame pets.</p>",1567

Most of the bristles are a dark brown to black color, but some are golden. This gives the spider an overall bronze sheen. Curly hair tarantulas are ground-dwelling, burrowing spiders native to Central America.And many are bred in captivity for the pet trade.</p><p>These spiders are generally calm, hardy, and easy to care for, making them ideal for those who are new to raising tarantulas as pets. They require housing that mimics their natural habitat, along with live prey. And, while some people do handle their tarantulas, they are mostly hands-off pets.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Curly hair tarantula, wooly tarantula</p><p>Scientific Names: (formerly)</p><p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 inches long (including its leg span)</p><p>Lifespan: 8 to 10 years on average in captivity (females), 4 years (males)</p><h2>Curly Hair Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These tarantulas make extraordinarily mellow and quiet pets. You might even find them boring if you expected a lively animal. A curly hair tarantula will move around its enclosure and might even rearrange some of the items you provide, such as pieces of bark. But for the most part, your spider will sit in a restful state unless it is hunting its prey.</p><p>However, curly hair tarantulas are easily spooked, so you should keep any handling to a minimum. Some spiders won't mind sitting on your hand or arm, as long as you handle them very calmly and gently. It's best to sit on the floor when handling these animals in case they do get scared and try to flee. A fall from even a few feet can seriously injure or kill them.</p><p>If they feel threatened, curly hair tarantulas also might use their defense mechanisms. They can kick hairs off their abdomens that irritate a person's skin and cause damage if they get in your eyes. That's why it's very important to wash your hands well (and don't rub your eyes) after handling a tarantula or anything in its enclosure. And while they're generally docile, curly hair tarantulas also might use their venomous bite to defend themselves.</p><p>Keep pet tarantulas away from any other animals in the house, as well as children who might inappropriately handle them. Curly hair tarantulas are solitary animals and shouldn't even be housed with other spiders of their own species. Expect to spend a few hours per week on feedings and cleaning. And then simply enjoy observing this interesting creature.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>The venom of a curly hair tarantula's bite typically causes a local reaction in people that's similar to a bee sting. However, some people with allergies to the venom can have more serious reactions and should seek immediate medical care.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Curly hair tarantulas have a leg span of around 5 to 6 inches across. Their body itself is about 3 inches long.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A 5- to 10-gallon tank with a secure, ventilated lid is suitable for curly hair tarantulas. These tarantulas aren't big climbers, so ground space is more important than height. The width of the tank should be roughly two to three times the leg span of the spider, and the length should be around three times its leg span. A height of around a foot is sufficient.</p><p>Keep the tank between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. You can use a heating pad under the tank to maintain the appropriate temperature, which you should monitor regularly with a thermometer. Keep the tank out of direct sunlight. Moreover, this tarantula needs a humidity level in its tank that's around 65 to 70 percent, which you can measure with a hygrometer. If you need to raise the humidity, mist the tank with clean water in a spray bottle.</p><p>Remove any uneaten prey after 24 hours to keep the enclosure clean. Also, monitor for mold growth, which can occur due to the humidity. If you notice any mold starting to grow on the bedding, remove that portion immediately. Expect to do a full change of the bedding every four to six months.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Add a layer of at least 3 inches of peat moss, chemical-free potting soil, or vermiculite to the bottom of the tank. Another option is coconut husk bedding, which is available at many pet stores. Then, add pieces of cork bark, a hollow log, or even half of a small clay flower pot to serve as a hiding spot for your spider.</p><h2>What Do Curly Hair Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Curly hair tarantulas eat live crickets, roaches, waxworms, and other insects. The insects should be no larger than the size of your tarantula's body. You also can give adult tarantulas the occasional pinky mouse. Young tarantulas generally will need feedings every two to five days while adults eat roughly once a week, though this can vary. Consult your veterinarian for the appropriate variety and quantity of food to give to your particular animal.</p><p>Simply drop the prey into the enclosure near your spider. It's recommended to do the feedings in the evening when the spider is more active and ready to eat. Just be sure to remove unwanted prey within 24 hours, or it actually can stress your spider.</p><p>Curly hair tarantulas get most of their hydration from their food. But you still should provide a shallow dish of water in the enclosure. Make sure the spider can easily climb in and out of the dish. Refresh the dish with clean water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Tarantulas typically don't face many health problems when kept in the appropriate environment and fed the right diet. But if your spider has become lethargic or isn't eating, consult your veterinarian to help you figure out the root cause.</p><p>More often than not, those behaviors are a sign that your spider is getting ready to molt a perfectly normal occurrence. During a molt, a tarantula sheds its exoskeleton and forms a new one. And many spiders molt while lying on their backs with their legs curled up, which some owners who aren't familiar with the process can mistake for a spider dying. The actual molt is complete in a few hours, but the entire process can take weeks. The new exoskeleton must harden to become protective for the spider. However, if you think your spider's molt is taking longer than it should or otherwise seems abnormal, discuss this with your vet. Also, during a molt, don't feed live prey, as it might damage the fragile new exoskeleton.</p><h3>TIp</h3><p>Because not all veterinarians specialize in exotic pets, make sure there is a vet near you who will see a tarantula before you acquire one.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like any animal, curly hair tarantulas need physical activity to stay healthy. But they don't require an excessive amount. As long as the tarantula's enclosure is sufficiently sized, your pet should get the exercise it needs.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>The way tarantulas essentially groom themselves is via molting. And as long as you maintain the right temperature and humidity in their environment and keep live prey away from them they shouldn't need any further assistance from you. Also, don't handle your spider during the molting process, as this can damage the fragile new exoskeleton.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary monthly cost when keeping a curly hair tarantula will be its diet. Expect to pay around $5 to $10 per month, though you often can decrease this cost by raising crickets yourself rather than purchasing them from a pet shop. Occasional substrate changes and replacing other worn items in the enclosure can run around $10 to $20. Also, don't forget to budget for veterinary care and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Curly Hair Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Curly hair tarantulas make for interesting and quiet pets. They don't require a lot of maintenance, and they take up minimal space. However, as tarantulas they certainly won't be cuddly or tame pets. Plus, they're not very active animals for those who prefer lots of excitement.</p><h2>Similar Tarantulasto the Curly Hair Tarantula </h2><p></p><p>Otherwise, check out other exotic animalsthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Curly Hair Tarantula </h2><p>You sometimes can find this species at pet stores. But it's often easier to go through a reputable breeder or exotic pet rescue group. Reputable sellers should be able to give you information on the animal's history and health. Expect to pay between $20 and $50 on average, though this can vary based on factors such as the animal's age. Also, females typically cost more because they have a longer lifespan.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>A local exotic animal veterinarian might be able to direct you to a good seller. The main benefit of going to a breeder is you'll likely have a wider selection of younger animals. Ask to visit with the animals before taking one home. Make sure the tarantula you choose is alert and in good body condition. A dull or shriveled appearance can indicate disease. If possible, ask to see the spider eat. To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself if you're taking home multiple spiders, simply house them individually.</p><p>A curly hair tarantula can be a good pet for children who understand its handling restrictions and are comfortable with feeding live prey.</p><p>Curly hair tarantulas are fairly low-maintenance pets, requiring regular feedings and periodic cleanings.</p>",1565
30,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ferret-facts-1236789,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Ferret</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Ferret</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Ferrets are playful pets that are very entertaining to watch. These long, slender animals are smart and curious and thus require training and lots of interaction with people. Some say they are like a combination of having a cat and a dog. They like attention and can bond closely with their humans. Their diet is pretty straightforward, and their housing is fairly easy to set up. But you will have to ferret-proof your house for out-of-cage time.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Ferret</p> <p>Adult Size: 13 to 16 inches long, weighing around 1.5 to 4.5 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 5 to 8 years in captivity</p><h2>Ferret Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Ferrets require a moderate amount of maintenance as pets. They are not totally nocturnal, but they do tend tosleep for a large part of the day. They are most active at dawn and dusk, but they can adapt their sleeping and active times to fit the schedules of their owners. Many ferrets enjoy being handled and playing with their humans when they're socialized from a young age. However, ferrets do tend to be a little nippy, especially if they're fearful or aggravated.</p><p>Ideally,ferretsshould be kept in a pair or small group. Same-sex littermates or neutered males and females can be kepthappily together.Ferrets and other household pets are another consideration. Some ferrets can get along with cats on an individual basis, as well as certain dogs with a low hunting drive. But as predators, ferrets typically shouldn't be around other small animals that they might see as prey.</p><p>The name ferret is derived from the Latin , which means ""thief."" Ferret owners can attest that this is a well-deserved name, as ferrets will happily steal anything they can get their paws on only to hide it in their house. Thus, they require a lot of supervision. Ferrets have relatively poor eyesight but a keen sense of smell and hearing. Moreover, ferrets do make noises, but they are relatively quiet pets.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Ferrets stretch between 13 to 16 inches long on average and weigh around 1.5 to 4.5 pounds. Male ferrets are generally larger than female ferrets.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Because they sleep for long stretches, most ferrets don't mind spending time in a cage. The best option is a large, multilevel, wire cage. At minimum, it should be two feet by two feet by three feet, but providing as large of an enclosure as you can fit and afford is always best. Some items to include are a sleeping hammock, shelves, a hiding hut, tunnels, and a litter box.</p><p>These animals are escape artists. So ensure that the cage door latches securely (a double latch is ideal) and the space between the wires is narrow enough that the ferret can't squeeze through.The temperature near the cage should be free of any drafts but not in an area that gets too warm. The ideal temperature for a ferret is between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>It's recommended that ferrets spend a minimum of four hours outside the cage every day. This means you'll need to ferret-proof your house. These creatures are smart and curious and can fit through small spaces you might have overlooked, so always keep an eye on them. Keep them away from dangerous appliances, cords, furniture they can get stuck in, trash cans, and more.Make sure there are always toys present for your ferret to play with and chew on.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Keep soft bedding on the floor of your ferret's enclosure. Some owners use towels or blankets, as long as the ferret doesn't chew on them and they don't have potentially dangerous strings hanging off. A 1- to 2-inch layer of paper bedding with no dye is also an option. Do not use wood shavings, as they can be harmful to the ferret's respiratory system.</p><h2>What Do Ferrets Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Ferrets are known as obligate carnivores. Because they can't absorb nutrients from plants, these animals need a diet of animal proteins and fat. Occasional treats of cooked lean meats and eggs are excellent foods for ferrets; avoid foods that are high in sugar or fiber. Grains are not recommended for ferrets, because they are difficult for the animals to digest.</p><p>A ferret's high metabolism means it needs to eat about every three to four hours. Make food readily available to ferrets all the time; unlike many animals, they rarely overeat. Offer a quality commercial diet made for ferrets in a small but sturdy dish, as they tend to tip over dishes. Also, make sure they always have access to clean water. Using a water bottle is best, but also provide a dish until you're certain the ferret is drinking from the bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Ferrets do require vaccinations and should be seen regularly by a vet.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Before acquiring a ferret, make sure there is a veterinarian nearby who specializes in this animal.</p><h2>Training Your Ferret </h2><h3>Leash Training </h3><p>Ferrets can be trained to walk on a harness and leash, so they can get exercise and mental stimulation outside safely. Start putting a ferret harness on your pet from a young age for progressively longer time periods, and reward it with a treat to give it a positive association with the harness. Make sure to purchase a harness specifically for ferrets, as they can easily slip out of ill-fitting harnesses. Have your vet show you how to properly fit it.</p><h3>Litter Training </h3><p>Like cats, most ferrets take well to using a litter box. Place a litter box in your ferret's cage where it already has shown a preference to relieve itself. If the cage has multiple levels, try including a litter box on each level. Use a litter box that is made especially for ferrets, as cat litter boxes typically have sides that are too high. When you catch your ferret using the box, praise it and/or treat it to positively reinforce the behavior.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>To help prevent obesity and other health issues, make sure your ferret gets at least a few hours per day outside of its cage to run around and play. Ferrets love playing in tubes, so you can set some up in your home for their enjoyment. There's also a variety of ferret toys on the market, such as balls.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Ferrets have a reputation for being smelly pets. It is true that they have a distinctive musky odor, but it is neither offensive nor overpowering. This smell comes from glands in their skin and is present whether the ferret is descented (has had its anal glands removed) or not. You can give your ferret an occasional bath to remove dirt and debris; about every two to three months is often sufficient. But regular bathing won't reduce its natural scent and might even make it worse. Drying out the skin through baths can result in the production of more odorous oils.</p><p>Beyond periodic baths, you can help a ferret stay well-groomed by keeping its nails trimmed. A vet can either do this for you or show you how. Plus, it's ideal to brush your ferret a few times a week, even though they self-groom. That way, they won't ingest as much loose fur that could cause a blockage.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary regular costs for a ferret will be its diet and litter. Expect to pay around $10 to $50 per month. You also might periodically have to replace toys and bedding. And you should budget for an annual veterinary checkup, as well as emergency vet care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Ferret as a Pet </h2><p>Ferrets are quite entertaining pets, and many enjoy playing with their humans. They also don't make a lot of noise. But they do notoriously get into things they shouldn't, so their space must be carefully ferret-proofed. And their cage must be very secure for the times when you can't watch them.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Ferret </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother exotic animalsthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Ferret </h2><p>You can find a ferret through a reputable breeder or adoption agency. These places should be able to give you information about the animal's history, temperament, and health, including vaccine records. It might cost a bit more than going to a pet store, but you are more likely to get an animal that has been well cared for and is healthy. Expect to pay around $100 to $500, though this can vary depending on factors such as the animal's age and coloring.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>A local exotic veterinarian often can recommend a good breeder. You are more likely to find a wider selection of young animals at a breeder, though there are some small animal and even ferret-specific rescues that also will offer a good selection.

31,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fiddler-crabs-1237222,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Fiddler Crab</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Fiddler Crab</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The term fiddler crab refers to around 100 species and subspecies of crabs from the genus They are found along beaches and brackish (a mixture of saltwater and freshwater) waterways around the world. Male and female fiddler crabs are easily distinguished by looking at their claws. The females have small claws while the males have one distinctive large claw. This large claw, held in such a way that it resembles a fiddle (violin), is how fiddler crabs got their name.</p><p>Fiddler crabs are fun to watch and fairly easy to keep as pets, with few health concerns and docile personalities. Their housing takes up minimal space, and there are many commercial foods available to provide them with a balanced diet.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Fiddler crab</p> <p>Adult Size: Around 2 inches long</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 3 years in captivity</p><h2>Fiddler Crab Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Unlike land hermit crabs, fiddler crabs spend a lot of their time in water. In the wild, they retreat to muddy burrows as the ocean tide goes out. In addition to digging burrows, picking up food, and defending themselves, fiddler crabs also use their claws to communicate. They will raise and lower their claws like a wave, which alerts other crabs to their presence.</p><p>In general, fiddler crabs are calm and quiet creatures that rarely display aggression. They can be kept with other crabs of their species, but you must watch out for males fighting over territory or a female in the tank. If this occurs, they'll need to be in separate tanks. In addition, it's best not to keep fiddler crabs in a tank with fish or any other species; they might try to catch the fish for food.</p><p>Fiddler crabs should be handled as little as possible, as this can cause them undue stress. Plus, they might pinch you with their claws if you frighten them. Instead, simply enjoy watching them as they move about their tank. And expect to spend just a few hours per week on feedings and keeping the tank clean.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Fiddler Crab</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Fiddler crabs range in size depending on the species. But in general, their bodies are around 2 inches across.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>To mimic their natural habitat, fiddler crabs in captivity need brackish water and a dry land area in their aquarium. Provide at least a 10-gallonaquarium if you have one to four fiddler crabs. Add 3 to 5 more gallons of tank space per each additional crab. Overcrowding is a major source of stress for crabs, and it can lead to health problems and aggression. Make sure the tank has a secure lid with ventilation (such as a mesh screen), as fiddler crabs can climb out of their tank when given the chance.</p><p>Use an aquarium water conditioner (available at most pet stores) to remove chlorine from the tank water. And then add aquarium salt to replicate the brackish conditions. Your package of aquarium salt might have instructions on how to create brackish water. The general rule for fiddler crabs is to add enough salt to the water to attain a specific gravity (a measurement for liquids that determines whether an object will sink or float in them) between 1.005 and 1.01. The specific gravity can be measured with a hydrometer, which is found at many pet stores in the fish section.</p><p>Furthermore, use a thermometer to ensure that the tank temperature is between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. If you need supplemental heat, position a reptile heat lamp over the land area of the tank.</p><p>A filter for the tank is optional, but it will keep the water clean for longer.Only use an internal tank filter, as fiddler crabs have been known to climb up external filter tubes and escape. If you don't have a filter, plan to change around 20% of the water every few days. If you have a filter, you'll likely only have to do this every one to three weeks, depending on how many crabs are in the tank creating waste.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>On the floor of the aquarium, slope sand down from one side to the other. Then, fill the tank so that water covers roughly half the sand. The water only needs to be a few inches deep. You also can place some large rocks in the water to create small islands that the crab can climb onto. Plus, you can add some plastic or live aquarium plants, pieces of driftwood, and other decorations to enrich the environment.</p><h2>What Do Fiddler Crabs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, fiddler crabs are scavengers that eat bits of organic matter they find in the sand andmud. In captivity, there are formulated commercial diets especially for crabs that make their feedings a breeze. You can find these foods at most pet stores that sell fish and crabs. In general, they are nutritionally complete flakes or pellets that you simply drop in the water where your crab will scavenge for them. You can also supplement their diet with several foods, including brine shrimp, blood worms, plankton, seaweed, and zucchini.</p><p>Follow any package instructions, as well as your veterinarian's advice, for how much and how often to feed. Feeding at the same time each day isn't critical, but you should remove uneaten food within 24 hours to prevent it from dirtying the water. Fiddler crabs do not need any supplemental drinking water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Fiddler crabs generally don't display many health problems in captivity. However, allowing waste to build up in the tank can cause your crab to get sick or even die. So if you notice your crab is sluggish or not eating, check the tank conditions and consult a vet.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians accept fiddler crabs as patients. So before you bring one home, make sure there is a vet nearby who can treat your animal.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like any animal, fiddler crabs need exercise to maintain physical fitness. As long as you provide them with a sufficiently sized tank, they should get all the activity they need.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Fiddler crabs essentially groom themselves via molting that is, shedding their exoskeleton and forming a new one. Prior to a molt a crab might slow down and lose its appetite, and during a molt it can appear fairly lifeless. This is normal. Do not disturb a crab during this molting process, which can take weeks to complete.Crabs are extremely fragile during this time, as their new exoskeleton must harden before it becomes protective. Also, wait about a week to remove the old exoskeleton from the tank, as your crab might ingest part of it for extra calcium. Fiddler crabs also can regenerate any lost legs or claws when they molt.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary regular costs for a fiddler crab will be its diet and maintaining its environment with clean water, water conditioner, and aquarium salt. Expect to pay around $5 to $15 per month. You also periodically might have to replace worn tank items, such as plants, at a cost of around $5 to $10.And don't forget to budget for veterinary care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Fiddler Crab as a Pet </h2><p>Fiddler crabs make for interesting and quiet pets. They also don't take up a lot of space. However, if you want a pet you can handle, this isn't the right fit for you. Plus, if you want an aquarium with multiple species, fiddler crabs also aren't a good choice.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Fiddler Crab </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out these other exotic animals that can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Fiddler Crab </h2><p>Unfortunately, many pet stores keep fiddler crabs in a freshwater aquatic setup, even referring to them as freshwater crabs and then recommending the same setup to new owners. Fiddler crabs might do fine housed in freshwater for a few weeks, but eventually they will become weak and die if they don't get a tank with brackish water.</p><p>So when you're looking for a pet crab, aim to purchase from a reputable breeder, pet shop, or rescue group that keeps its animals in the appropriate brackish water from the start. That way you're more likely to get a healthy animal. Expect to pay around $5 to $10 on average.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Local exotic animal veterinarians might be able to guide you to a reputable fiddler crab seller. Make sure the seller can give you information on the crab's origin, age, and health. And be sure to choose a crab that isn't missing any legs or claws, as this can indicate trauma or poor health.</p><p>If you'll be bringing home multiple crabs, you generally won't have to worry about breeding. Female fiddler crabs might produce eggs in captivity, but odds are you won't have baby crabs. Successful rearing of young fiddler crabs in an aquarium is next to impossible. In the wild, the larvae of fiddler crabs grow in deep ocean waters and return to shore at maturity. Because aquariums aren't deep enough to mimic this, the crab life cycle is rarely successfully completed in captivity.</p><p>Fiddler crabs can be good pets for kids who understand they're hands-off pets.</p><p>Fiddler crabs are relatively easy to care for as long as you can get their environmental conditions right.</p><p>While fiddler crabs do sometimes sit on land, they don't like to be held by people. This can cause them undue stress.</p>",1550
32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/short-tailed-opossums-1236983,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Short-Tailed Opossum as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Short-Tailed Opossum as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Short-tailed opossums have grown in popularity as exotic pets over the past few years. They are very good pets for beginners due to their cleanliness, omnivorous diet, and general good health. These opossums are small, friendly creatures with easy care requirements and they're cute! Not to be confused with the North American opossums that may be rescued by wildlife centers, these shorter-tailed cousins have been imported and bred as pets since 1978.</p><p>Native to Brazil and neighboring countries in South America, the short-tailed opossum has a thick, grey-brown coat, a muzzle similar to a rat, and very sharp teeth. They have large ears, which make them quite sensitive to sound, and big eyes that give them good night vision. Their hind legs are a good deal longer than their front legs. An opossum's tail is hairless and prehensile, meaning that it can wrap around and hold onto objects.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Short-tailed opossum</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:4 to 6 inches long, not counting the tail</p><p>Lifespan:4 to 6 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Short-Tailed Opossum? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>As of June 2006, hobbyists with three or fewer breeding females do not need a federal USDA license to own a short-tailed opossum; as they are a species from South America, they are not wildlife indigenous to North America. However, larger breeders and retail pet stores do need a current USDA license to sell them.</p><p>The state agencies that regulate exotic pet ownership are the Department of Fish & Game and the Department of Natural Resources. Check with your local state agency to make sure you are legally allowed to house a South American short-tailed opossum and be sure you specify the full species name to avoid receiving misinformation.</p><p>Lastly, check with your local municipality to find out if it islegal to own a short-tailed opossum in your specific town. You may need a special permit or registration. An exotics vet can also help clarify your town or city laws.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>As with all pets, ethical ownership often comes down to the quality of life you can provide your pet with. Before adding a short-tailed opossum to your family, make sure you have the financial ability and time to invest in caring for the animal. While it may be legal to own one, it will not be ethical if you can not provide it with the proper quality of care.</p><h2>Short-Tailed Opossum Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>When raised from a young age, short-tailed opossums can be friendly and docile. They can be handled easily by people and are curious, active, and entertaining. However, because of their tendency to fight with others of their own species, they do best as solitary pets. Cage mates will become aggressive and may eventually even kill each other.</p><p>Short-tailed opossums should only be kept together for breeding and, even then, a pair should be only allowed together for a short time period. There seems to be no difference between the genders when it comes to temperament around humans both males and females make equally good pets, as both are inquisitive and friendly.</p><p>Opossums are marsupials, although they do not have a young-rearing pouch, like most marsupials. Their young are born quite premature and helpless, so they latch onto a nipple on their mother's abdomen and will stay close by until they are further developed. Additionally, the short-tailed opossum is a nocturnal animal so it might not be a good pet for a child.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Short-tailed opossums are adept at escaping, so whatever enclosure is provided should be made as escape-proof as possible. A well-ventilated aquarium (at least 20 gallons) with a tight-fitting lid or a narrow-mesh wire cage should work well. The temperature of the enclosure should be kept at 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>A nest box is also required either a commercial woven nest or a plastic container like a margarine tub will work, but be sure there are no sharp edges. Branches for perching and climbing are also necessary to keep your pet active and stimulated. Make sure they are non-toxic and have never been treated with any pesticides; parrot climbing toys and ladders also work well for opossums.</p><p>Short-tailed opossums are fairly tidy creatures and will usually pick a corner area to use as a potty; place a litter pan in that location to make cage cleaning easier. These animals are relatively odor-free, and they only need the cage cleaned once per week.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Bedding should be provided for the opossum. Corn cob litter or shavings (avoid cedar) typically work well, but tissue or shredded paper (avoid inked newspaper) can be used as nesting material as well.</p><h2>What Does a Short-Tailed Opossum Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Short-tailed opossum owners and breeders tend to feed a wide variety of things to their animals. It's possible to get commercially manufactured short tail food otherwise, a commercial insectivore diet provides the best basic nutrition. Alternatively, some people feed their short-tailed opossums cat food, ferret food, and a variety of other pelleted diets with success.</p><p>Ultimately, you should look for diets that are high in protein and low in fat. A variety of additional treats should be offered, including mealworms, crickets, fresh fruit and vegetables, and hard-boiled eggs. Other options for quick and easy opossum foods are applesauce and baby foods.</p><p>Dry food should be available throughout the day and live insects or fruit can be offered between one and five times a day. Feeding bigger items such as eggs or chicken is best done at night, and you should remove the items in the morning if they have not been consumed. Occasionally, special treats can include small amounts of cooked chicken and low-fat yogurt.</p><p>Using a general vitamin or mineral supplement is a good idea as well. Water is very important to short tails as they can dehydrate very quickly, so it's vital to make sure their hanging water bottle is always accessible and filled with fresh, clean, and clear (preferably non-chlorinated) water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The short-tailed opossums are fairly hardy pets. They can become ill if proper care is not taken, but most ailments are preventable with attention and treatment. They do seem to suffer from anal prolapse, which can be effectively prevented with ivermectin twice a year.</p><p>You should also have regular visits with an exotic animal veterinarian to care for this unusual pet. Make sure you have one lined up and at the ready prior to bringing your short-tailed opossum home. You'll need to schedule regular check-ups and you'll want them on-hand to help you with any emergencies as inquisitive pets sometimes get into things they shouldn't.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>While they don't need a ton of exercise, you should give your short-tailed opossum plenty of opportunities to be active, especially within their enclosure. They should have plenty of branches or ladders to climb and perch on. In addition, a solid-surface hamster wheel can be added to provide an opportunity for exercise. They may also like tunnels, cardboard tubing, flowerpots, and other containers to climb through and into. Keep in mind, short-tailed opossums are most active in the evening, so you'll want to locate their cage somewhere where they won't disturb your sleep as they're playing.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Short-tailed opossums take their cleanliness very seriously and, like house casts, spend a lot of the time grooming themselves with their tongues and paws. Because of this, there isn't much you need to do to groom your short-tailed opossum they will take of everything on their own. If for some reason your opossum gets into something and needs a bath, you can either bathe them with a gentle pet shampoo or give them a dust bath using chinchilla dust.</p><h2>Training Your Short-Tailed Opossum </h2><p>Training your short-tailed opossum begins by bonding with your animal. Short-tailed opossums should be acquired young if possible and handled frequently (and gently) from the start. That being said, short-tailed opossums aren't typically the type of animal that are trained to do tricks or certain behaviors it's a win if they are docile and calm while you're handling them.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Short-Tailed Opossum </h2><p>Bringing home a short-tailed opossum baby that's three to four months old is best, but adults can bond with you as well. Always check first with local adoption agencies, rescues, and exotics rehabbers to see if they have or can locate a short-tailed opossum in need of a forever home. The next best option is to find a reputable breeder in your area rescues may be able to inform you on this topic as well.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Short-Tailed Opossum </h2><p></p><p>Otherwise, check out other exotic animals that can be your pet.</p><p>Short-tailed opossums are not hard to take care of. They are friendly creatures with easy care requirements, making them a good option for beginner owners looking for an exotic pet.</p><p>Short-tailed opossums actually experience a longer lifespan in captivity than they do in their natural environment. As pets, they can live up to six years with proper care; in the wild, they typically live no more than two years, given natural predators and other dangers.</p><p>Short-tailed opossums live longer in a domesticated environment, and other facets of their lives may be improved as well. They will no longer have to hunt for food or contend with other opossums, which can often lead to physical conflict.</p>",1544
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/african-pygmy-hedgehogs-as-pets-1236866,Small Pets > Hedgehogs,<h1>How to Care for a Pet African Pygmy Hedgehog</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet African Pygmy Hedgehog</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Hedgehogs have smooth spines on their coat, similar to the bristles of a brush. Unlike rigid porcupine quills, which are sharp, these creatures are more approachable and not dangerous as pets.</p><p>The African pygmy hedgehog, or four-toed hedgehog, is the smallest of the hedgehog species and is the species often sold for the pet trade. You can find these animals in a wide array of color patterns, including salt and pepper, snowflake, andcinnamon. Pet hedgehogs are quiet, active, and entertaining, but they require a lot of care. They need spacious housing that must be cleaned often and a quality hedgehog food. Plus, as nocturnal animals you will need to feed and care for them in the evening hours.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:African pygmy hedgehog, four-toed hedgehog</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:6 to 8 inches long, weighing between 8 to 21 ounces</p><p>Lifespan:3 to 6 years in captivity (up to 10 years has been recorded)</p><h2>African Pygmy Hedgehog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Requiring a moderate amount of care and active mostly at night, African pygmy hedgehogs are a good pet for someone who has a 9-to-5 job. They are quiet and solitary animals that do not crave human interaction or the company of other animals. They take time to get used to humans but can be hand-tamed with constant, gentle handling and interaction. Hedgehogs are not known to bite; the spines are their main form of defense.</p><p>Most hedgehogs have an interesting ""self-anointing"" habit, which can be off-putting to witness for the first time. When a hedgehog gets introduced to a new scent or food, it begins to froth at the mouth and spread its saliva all over its back. No one is entirely sure why hedgehogs do this, and some do it more than others. But it is not a cause for concern. Experts think it could be a stress release or a form of protection.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>African pygmy hedgehogs stretch between 6 and 8 inches long and weigh about 1 pound on average. They reach maturity in roughly two to eight months.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>These solitary animals prefer to be housed alone and might fight if kept with other hedgehogs.Even individually, they need room to explore. An enclosure that's at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long is sufficient, though bigger is always better. Select housing with a smooth floor and walls, such as an aquarium. Make sure it has a tight-fitting mesh lid to allow for air flow and security. An enclosure with wire walls is also an option, but make sure the wire spacing is one inch or less to prevent the hedgehog from squeezing through. Do not use an enclosure with wire floors, as this can hurt their feet.</p><p>The hedgehog's housing should be in a spot that's quiet, dimly lit, and warm (around 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit). Include a box or other hiding spot where the hedgehog can go to feel safe and sleep. Some hedgehogs also enjoy playing with toys, such as small balls, and they tend to enjoy tunnels. Unlike some small animals, hedgehogs do not tend to use litter pans, so expect to do a lot of cleaning.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Aspen shavingsand recycled paper alternatives are commonly used bedding options, as is kiln-dried pine. Avoid cedar shavings, as the scent can be toxic to small mammals. Some African pygmy hedgehog owners use indoor-outdoor carpeting or fleece fabric to line the cage instead of using loose bedding material. These options are more sustainable, as they can be washed and reused. However, if you choose carpeting or fabric, make sure to clip loose threads that can tangle up your hedgehog, and always have a backup piece for easy cleaning and replacing.</p><h2>What Do African Pygmy Hedgehogs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, hedgehogs are primarily insect-eating mammals. High-quality cat food supplemented with mealworms, crickets, and other treats used to be the go-to food choice for pet hedgehogs. Nowadays, the pet industry sells high-quality hedgehog food that provides the exact nutrients your prickly pet needs. If you choose to feed it cat food, make sure it is a grain-free variety.</p><p>Being that hedgehogs are nocturnal, it's best to feed your pet at night when it is most active. Use a small bowl with low sides for its commercial diet. Dispose of any remaining food from the previous day, and add a fresh day's worth of food to the bowl. In addition to the staple diet, provide around 1 teaspoon of chopped fruits and veggies per day in a separate small bowl. It's best to do this in the early evening, so you can remove remnants in the late evening before the fresh food spoils. Check with your veterinarian for appropriate fruits and veggies to feed.</p><p>Furthermore, you may offer insects, including mealworms and crickets, a few times a week. Chasing live insects mimics foraging efforts in the wild and provides mental stimulation for captive hedgehogs</p><p>Supply water in either a water bottle or a small bowl. Some hedgehogs might need both until they get used to using the bottle. Whatever you choose, make sure to change your hedgehog's water daily (or more often if it gets dirty), and check regularly that the bottle tip is working.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians have experience with hedgehogs. Before even acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet nearby who will be able to treat your animal.</p><h2>Training Your African Pygmy Hedgehog </h2><p>The most common training hedgehogs respond to is being hand-tamed. At first, this discerning animal might curl into a spiky ball when you try to pick it up. Be patient and cradle the ball in your hand, allowing your hedgehog to unroll itself and start exploring in its own time. When your hedgehog realizes you mean no harm, it will get more active and its spines will flatten.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>African pygmies like to exercise, and they need it to prevent obesity and other health issues. In the wild, they travel great distances daily. Provide an exercise wheel for your hedgehog to get active. The wheel should be open-sided and have a solid surface rather than bars, which can cause injury. It should be at least 10 inches in diameter to allow your hedgehog plenty of room to run in place.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>A hedgehog will generally groom itself. However, it might need periodic nail trims, as it likely won't wear down its nails in captivity like it would in its natural environment. Many owners can learn to trim their hedgehog's nails on their own after a vet shows them how. It's important to keep your hedgehog calm and still during this process.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Regular purchases of essentials for your hedgehog will include a quality diet and fresh bedding. Some additional costs you might incur include treats and toys. Also, don't forget to factor in the cost of an annual veterinary checkup, along with emergency vet visits. On a monthly basis, you can look at spending between $20 and $40 on average, depending on the types of diet and bedding you choose.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping an African Pygmy Hedgehog as a Pet </h2><p>Hedgehogs generally aren't cuddly animals, and they're most active at night. So they're probably not for someone who wants a very hands-on pet to hang out with during the day. However, they're quiet animals that don't take up ample space and don't need a lot of attention. Plus, they can be an interesting and entertaining companion.</p><h2>Similar Small Exotic Pets to the African Pygmy Hedgehog </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out otherexotic animalsthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your African Pygmy Hedgehog </h2><p>Instead of buying your spiny companion from a pet store where you don't know its origin, look for a reputable breeder or rescue. There are hedgehog-specific rescue groups in many areas. You also can check with a local exotic animal veterinarian to see whether they know someone who wants to rehome a pet. The average price ranges from $100 to $300, though this can vary widely. Young, hand-tamed hedgehogs often go for higher prices, as do hedgehogs with desirable coloring.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>There's no difference between acquiring a hedgehog through a breeder or adopting one, though you might be able to find a younger animal via a breeder. A good breeder will breed for sound temperament and handle their young hedgehogs regularly. Their hedgehogs should have bright eyes, clear nostrils, and healthy skin, quills, and fur.</p><p>Beware of flaky skin,missing spines, or discharge around the eyes or nose. Also, make sure the hedgehog has a good body condition not too thin, not too heavy and shows no evidence of diarrhea. A veterinarian can help steer you toward a good breeder. To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, simply house your hedgehogs individually.</p><p>Hedgehogs prefer a relaxed environment and are nocturnal, so they likely wouldn't be good pets for young kids. However, they might enjoy interacting with calm older children.</p><p>Hedgehogs generally don't like to cuddle, but they can learn to trust humans and be comfortable with being held.</p><p>Hedgehogs require a moderate amount of maintenance, primarily in keeping their environment clean. But their feeding is fairly straightforward, and they don't require a lot of attention.</p>",1526
34,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dwarf-winter-white-russian-hamsters-1238954,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Winter White Dwarf Hamster</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Winter White Dwarf Hamster</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2> <p>Winter white dwarf hamsters, also known as Russian dwarf hamsters, are a small hamster species with a social personality. As pets, they usually are docile and take well to handling, though they can be difficult to hold due to their small size and quickness. They are around half the size of the Syrian hamster that is also commonly seen as a pet.</p><p>The coat of winter white dwarf hamsters is actually a grayish-brown color for most of the year. But, in the winter, it changes to white to act as camouflage in the snow. In captivity, the coat isn't guaranteed to change colors if the hamster isn't exposed to the shorter winter light patterns.These hamsters are typically easy to care for as pets, requiring a fairly straightforward diet and housing setup.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Winter white dwarf hamster, Russian dwarf hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 4 inches long, weighing around 1 to 2 ounces</p><p>Lifespan: 1 to 3 years</p><h2>Winter White Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Winter white dwarf hamsters can make excellent and relatively low-maintenance pets, even for those who are new to hamster care. They are typically good-natured and are more tolerant of handling that several other hamster species, making them less likely to bite. However, they still might nip when startled, jostled, or squeezed. Plus, they might be too small and quick for some people, especially young children, to gently and safely handle.</p><p>These hamsters are nocturnal, but they might be active for short times throughout the day. They are generally quiet pets, but their nighttime activities might keep some people awake if you have their enclosure near your bed.</p><p>Moreover, they are a relatively social species that can be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups when introduced at a young age. However, adult hamsters that are new to each other might become territorial and fight. And even some young hamsters raised together might end up fighting and need to be separated as they get older. Furthermore, do not expose winter white dwarfs to other household pets, including other hamster species, as this can cause unnecessary stress and potential injuries.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Winter white dwarf hamsters stretch around 3 to 4 inches long on average, and they weigh approximately 1 to 2 ounces. They mature at around 2 months old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>As a general rule, provide a habitat for your hamster that is as large as you can fit and afford. This will be your hamster's primary space for exercise and mental stimulation. At minimum, opt for a cage that's at least 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot high. The two main options for an enclosure are a glass/plastic aquarium with a secure top that has ventilation or a wire cage with a plastic base. Make sure the wire spacing is small enough that the hamster can't squeeze through.</p><p>In the enclosure, include chew toys, an exercise wheel with a solid surface (not wires), and a nest in which your hamster can sleep and hide. You also can include tubes and other climbing structures, though make sure not to create a structure from which your hamster can take a significant fall.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Cover the bottom of the enclosure with 2 to 3 inches of soft bedding, such as chemical- and dye-free shredded paper oraspen shavings.Avoid cedar and pine wood shavings, as they can be toxic to hamsters. Remove wet spots in the bedding daily, and do a full bedding change weekly when you scrub the entire enclosure with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Winter White Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>For your pet's primary diet, pick a commercial hamster food that's specifically formulated for dwarf hamsters. Follow the label and your vet's instructions for how much to feed. Hamsters should always have some of this food available, as they tend to graze. Many owners put a full day's worth of food in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure and discard any uneaten food after 24 hours before refilling the bowl.</p><p>You can also offer some supplemental foods, consulting with your vet on the appropriate types and amounts. Some options include greens, carrots, blueberries, and oats. Place fresh food in a separate dish from the staple diet, and discard it after a few hours to prevent spoilage. It's best to feed in the evening as your hamster is waking up and hungry.</p><p>Also, always provide your hamster with fresh, clean water. A water bottle that hangs on the side of the enclosure is best, as it's easy to keep sanitary. However, also include a small dish of water until you're sure your hamster is drinking from the bottle. Regularly check that the water nozzle is functioning, and change the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <p>Some potential signs and symptoms of illness can include loss of appetite, lethargy, unwillingness to socialize (hiding), excessive scratching or hair loss, sneezing, wheezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, and abnormal droppings. If your hamster appears to be sick or injured, keep it in a warm, quiet spot and contact your veterinarian.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians treat hamsters. So before even acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is an exotic vet nearby who will see it.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>Hand-taming is the primary training most owners do with their pet hamsters. And it's important to note that some hamsters will never be comfortable with handling. It's best to start handling hamsters when they're young. Sit on the ground in a secure area when doing so, as even a drop from a few feet can injure such a tiny animal. Never shake or squeeze a hamster. Try holding a favorite treat as a reward for the hamster to sit in your hands.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As long as you provide a large enough enclosure with an exercise wheel, your hamster should be able to get enough physical activity to keep it healthy and prevent issues like obesity. You also can give your hamster out-of-cage exercise via an exercise ball, in which they can safely roam around your floor in a secure area. Always monitor the hamster when it's in the ball, and make sure you get a ball sized for a dwarf hamster.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Hamsters are generally clean animals that are good about self-grooming. They don't require baths or brushing. However, if they do get something stuck in their fur, you can help them get it out by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth if they'll allow it.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>From month to month, your primary costs for a winter white dwarf hamster will be its diet and bedding. Depending on the varieties you choose plus how big your enclosure is and how many hamsters you have expect to pay between $20 and $40 on average. Chew sticks, nests, and other toys also will need replacing periodically at a cost of around $10. Plus, make sure you budget for routine veterinary care and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Winter White Dwarf Hamster as a Pet </h2><p>Winter white dwarf hamsters can be quite interesting and good-natured pets. They're generally a good choice for people who haven't had hamsters before. However, their small size and quickness can make them difficult to handle for some people. And because they're nocturnal, you might not be able to interact with them when they're at their most active.</p><h2>Similar Hamsters to the Winter White Dwarf </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother hamstersthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Winter White Dwarf Hamster </h2><p>You can find winter white dwarf hamsters in pet stores, but because they are very similar to Campbell's dwarf hamsters (more commonly found), pet stores often misidentify them. To be sure you are acquiring a winter white dwarf, get your hamster through a reputable breeder or knowledgable rescue group. Expect to pay between $15 and $25, though this can vary based on factors such as the animal's age.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Local exotic veterinarians often can point you toward a good breeder or rescue group. Plus, many breeders belong to clubs that attend pet expos where you can learn about and even buy hamsters. Breeders often will have a wider selection of younger animals than a rescue group.</p><p>Before bringing home a hamster, make sure it appears alert and in good body condition. Its environment should be clean, and any cage mates also should appear to be in good health. Avoid bringing home mixed-sex pairs or groups; they will turn your habitat into a breeding tank, which can produce a litter every three weeks. A good breeder or rescue will be able to confirm the sex of any hamster you're interested in.</p><p>Winter white dwarf hamsters can be good pets for older children who are able to handle this small, quick, fragile animal with care.</p><p>Winter whites are fairly low-maintenance pets, with their primary care needs revolving around regular feedings and cleanings.</p><p>Many winter white dwarf hamsters can learn to tolerate gentle handling quite well, though they never will be fully tame animals.</p>",1501

Native to the Great Plains region of the United States, black-tailed prairie dogs live in colonies on these grasslands.</p><p>Taking up residence close to small rivers, on sloping hills, or on flat grasslands, prairie dog colonies thrive by burrowing into a variety of soils and foraging for plentiful food options. Simulating their natural habitat is what dictates their complex needs. Keeping prairie dogs as petsis difficult; they require a long-term commitment from a devoted owner who has the expertise to provide an advanced level of specific care. Prairie dogs are susceptible to human diseases and can also become aggressive if not given many hours of daily socialization.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Prairie dog</p> <p>Adult Size: 11 to 13 inches long; weighing 1 to 3.5 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 8 to 10 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Prairie Dog? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>While prairie dogs are legal to own as pets in most states, there are instances where they can be considered wild animals and therefore are illegal or require a permit. Prairie dogs were one of the main culprits implicated in a monkeypox outbreak in 2003 and were then banned as pets for over five years in the United States.</p><p>As of 2008, the FDA lifted its restrictions on pet prairie dogs, but in 2016, prairie dogs carrying the plague again became a concern. Check with your state before getting a prairie dog to be sure you're in compliance with local and state laws.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Like with most pets, there are a few ethical things to consider before investing in a prairie dog as a pet. First and foremost, you need to ensure you have the time, energy, and finances available to properly care for a prairie dog. They require a lot of care and attention and will not do well if starved for attention.</p><p>Additionally, prairie dogs are very social creatures and thrive in large groups in the wild. For this reason, unless you can give your prairie dog nearly undivided attention throughout the day, it's recommended to house more than one prairie dog together for company, socialization, and overall welfare.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>For the best chance at successfully owning a prairie dog as a pet, it's recommended that you acquire your animal while young, so they can be properly socialized and grow up accustomed to life in captivity.</p><p>Additionally, prairie dogs can get nippy if frustrated or handled incorrectly. For this reason, they may not be suitable to a home with small children who may handle the pet unsupervised.</p><h2>Prairie Dog Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Prairie dogs are diurnal, meaning that they are active during the daytime hours and sleep at night. As very social creatures, prairie dogs will become depressed or sick if not given enough attention. If you don't have at least six hours per day to spend with your prairie dog, then plan on having a full colony of prairie dogs or none at all. With the right training, pet prairie dogs can be leash trained (using a special prairie dog harness) and even learn to come when they hear their name.</p><p>The sex of a prairie dog doesn't make one gender a better pet than the other, with the exception that male prairie dogs possibly have a stronger musky odor than females, but the smell is not unpleasant. Both sexes need to be either spayed or neutered to avoid health issues later in life. If you do not get your female prairie dog spayed, her estrous cycle (referred to as ""rut"") will cause her to become aggressive and it will drastically (but temporarily) alter her behavior.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Providing a natural environment where a prairie dog can burrow and forage for food at all stages of a prairie dog's life is essential. As adults, they are able to burrow several feet underground and often create different subterranean chambers for different purposes. Unless you have a large enclosure (such as a 10-foot by 10-foot concrete-bordered pit filled three feet deep with dirt to allow burrowing), a large dog-sized cage is unfortunately usually used to house a pet prairie dog indoors. Keep in mind, if you choose a housing method where burrowing is prevented, it is not ideal and may lead to anxiety from overexposure to stimulus. Be sure to provide them with plenty of places to hide, like boxes, tunnels, and more. A secure, escape-proof cage is also recommended.</p><p>If given an appropriate burrow outside, prairie dogs can withstand extreme temperatures on either end of the thermometer, keeping themselves warm in the winter and cool in the summer through burrowing. However, if you house your prairie dog outside without a burrow, their systems are ill-equipped to deal with extreme hot or cold temperatures. Generally, they prefer temperatures around 70 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>What Do Prairie Dogs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>A natural prairie dogdiet consists primarily of grasses, with some brush and roots. They rely on the prickly pear cactus (which you can grow in bulk at home) for much of their water intake. Depending on the season, prairie dogs may eat more underground roots than grasses, but they are known to be foragers and can adapt to changing environments while in search of food.</p><p>In captivity, prairie dogs eat a simple vegetarian diet of pellets, fresh hay, grasses, fresh fruits, vegetables, and water. When kept as a pet, prairie dogs should be fed a high fiber pellet diet, along withtimothy hayortimothy hay cubes. This food was formulated specifically for the nutritional requirements of captive prairie dogs. You should also offerwhole oats and fresh vegetables, including raw sweet potatoes and raw carrots. Food and water should be readily available at all times, as prairie dogs are grazers and like to eat day and night.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Each year, prairie dogs will go into arutting period that can last for several months. During this time, their personalities can drastically change; they often become defensive or even aggressive.Prairie dogs also seem to be very susceptible to plague, which makes them a risk to nearby human populations. Some parks have been shut down in an attempt to prevent the spread to people.</p><p>In captivity, prairie dogs are susceptible to obesity from being fed the wrong foods, dental issues from a lack of fibrous foodstuffs that clean teeth and gums, and diet-associated heart disease and respiratory diseases. Ultimately these health issues are due to a mismanaged habitat and, as with many systemic diseases, symptoms are often vague and non-specific. Any sign of irregularity in your prairie dog warrants an examination from your exotic animal veterinarian. Consider bringing your prarie dog in for wellness exams to discuss diet, housing, and overall husbandry for recommendations on improvement and to ensure your pet is healthy.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Prairie Dog </h2><p>Baby prairie dogs generally become available in the U.S. between the months of April and July. This is around the time when they breed and then pups are collected. In an effort to control their population, thousands of prairie dog pups are collected each spring and summer by vacuuming them out of their burrows.</p><p>A revamped sewer truck is often used to suck the rodents out of their homes; they are then either used as food for endangered wild animals such as eagles and black-footed ferrets (which naturally controlled the population until humans drove the species to near extinction), or are sold to the pet trade.</p>",1248

They make fairly low-maintenance and affectionate pets, though they do need socializing or might be prone to nipping. They are also one of the fastest hamsters, sometimes making it difficult to keep hold of them. Still, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are relatively easy to care for, requiring a pretty straightforward diet and regular enclosure cleaning.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Campbell's dwarf hamster</p> <p>Adult Size: 2 to 4 inches long on average, weighing around 1 to 2 ounces</p><p>Lifespan: 2 to 3 years</p><h2>Campbell's Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Campbell's dwarf hamsters are generally low-maintenance, quiet pets. During their waking hours, they like to dig, tunnel, and explore. They are nocturnal but might be active for short times during the day too. Most are friendly and don't mind being handled, especially if you start gently handling them from a young age. But some might nip if they feel threatened. Plus, they can be a challenge to handle because they are so small and quick.</p><p>These hamsters won't bond with a person like a cat or dog would, but many will come up to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby. And unlike some other hamster species, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are social with their species. They can be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups, ideally introduced to each other from a young age.But always monitor them for any signs of aggression, as they can become territorial. Also, because they are so small and fragile, it's best to keep them away from other household pets, including other hamster species.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>The Campbell's dwarf hamster only stretches around 2 to 4 inches long on average, and it generally weighs between 1 and 2 ounces. It will mature at around 2 months old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Provide your hamster with as large of a cage as you can fit and afford, as this will be its primary spot to exercise and get mental stimulation. There are two main options for an enclosure: a glass/plastic aquarium with a secure mesh top for ventilation or a wire cage with a plastic base. If you go with a wire option, make sure the bars are close enough that the hamster can't squeeze through them, as these little creatures tend to be escape artists.</p><p>Within the enclosure, include a nest or other structure in which your hamster can sleep and hide. Also, add chew toys and an exercise wheel with a flat surface (not wire) to prevent any injuries.</p><p>You also can include hamster tubes and compartments for your pet to explore. But make sure they don't take up too much space, especially if you have multiple hamsters in the enclosure. Tight spaces can lead to a higher probability of territorial behaviors or fighting.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The bottom of the enclosure should have a 1- to 2-inch layer of bedding, such as aspen wood shavings or unscented natural cellulose fibers. Avoid wire flooring, as it can damage tender hamster feet. Also, avoid cedar wood or pine shavings, as these can be harmful to rodents. Remove wet spots in the bedding daily. And fully change the bedding weekly when you wash the whole enclosure with mild soap and water.</p><h2>What Do Campbell's Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Hamsters should have constant access to food and water. A small ceramic food bowl works well, as it's too tough to chew and too heavy to knock over. Many owners prefer using a water bottle attached to the cage, as it helps to keep the water more sanitary. But also provide a water dish until you're sure your hamster is drinking from the bottle, and check the bottle regularly to make sure the nozzle is working. Fill it with fresh water daily.</p><p>Select a commercial hamster food that's formulated for dwarf hamsters. Consult your veterinarian on the proper quantity to feed, as this can vary based on factors such as age and size. Discard any uneaten food after 24 hours. You also can give your hamster some supplemental foods, again consulting your vet on the appropriate types and amounts. Some options include oats, carrots, and greens.It's best to feed fresh foods in the evening as your hamster is waking up and hungry; remove them after a few hours to prevent spoilage.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Campbell's dwarf hamsters are prone to some health problems. Diabetes is common in the species. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, as well as a sweet smell to the urine. Moreover, glaucoma is another common condition within this species.</p><p>Furthermore, hamsters are prone to wet tail, which is diarrhea brought on by an overgrowth of bacteria in the digestive system. It is highly contagious to other rodents and must be treated with antibiotics quickly or else it might kill the hamster.</p><p>Finally, hamster teeth naturally grow continuously. And sometimes they become overgrown, especially if the hamster doesn't have enough chewable materials in its environment to wear them down. Overgrown teeth can impede a hamster's ability to eat, and you might notice it losing weight. A vet can trim overgrown teeth and then advise you on how to prevent this problem.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians treat hamsters. So before even acquiring a Campbell's dwarf hamster, make sure there is a vet nearby who will see this animal.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>Hand-taming is the most common training people do with their pet hamsters. Always sit on the floor when handling your hamster, as even a drop from a few feet can seriously harm it. Also, make sure the space is secure in case your hamster accidentally gets loose. Never squeeze or jolt a hamster as you hold it. If it's getting antsy, place it back in its enclosure. It can be helpful to hold a favorite treat, so your hamster forms a positive association with handling.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Exercise is critical for hamsters to help prevent health issues such as obesity. Providing a large enclosure and an exercise wheel should give the hamster what it needs to be physically active. You also can purchase a hamster ball for it to roll around in outside of its enclosure. Ensure that the ball is the proper size for a dwarf hamster, and always monitor your pet when it's in the ball.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Hamsters self-groom and generally don't need any help from you. However, if they get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can gently rub the area with a damp cloth if they'll allow it.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>On a monthly basis, food and bedding will be your essential costs for a hamster. Expect to spend around $20 to $40, depending on your chosen diet and bedding type (plus the size of the enclosure). Every so often, you'll also have to replace chew sticks, nests, and other toys, which will cost around $10 on average. Plus, make sure to budget for an annual veterinary checkup and emergency medical care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Campbell's Dwarf Hamster as a Pet </h2><p>Hamsters are interesting and generally quiet pets that don't take up a lot of space. They also don't require an excessive amount of maintenance. However, they are mostly up at night, so you might miss them when they're at their most active. And they can be difficult to handle as small, quick, and fragile animals.</p><h2>Similar Hamsters to the Campbell's Dwarf </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other hamstersthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Campbell's Dwarf Hamster </h2><p>If you're certain you want a Campbell's dwarf hamster, go to a reputable breeder or rescue organization. Pet stores often carry hybrids or misidentify this species with its similar relatives. Expect to pay between $15 and $25, though this can vary based on factors such as age and coloring.</p><p>When choosing your pet, look for one with bright eyes and a shiny coat. Its tail should be clean and dry. And it should be housed in a clean environment where none of the other hamsters appear to have health issues.</p>",1336
37,https://www.thesprucepets.com/goats-as-pets-1236834,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Should You Keep a Goat as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Goat as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Although they are traditionally thought of as farm animals, goatsalso make good pets. A perennial favorite in petting zoos, their curious and friendly nature makes them fun companions. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goats, but the dwarf or pygmy goat varieties are most commonly kept as pets. Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species around the world, and they are still raised for their milk, meat, fur, and skin. Goats are herd animals, so they need at least one goat partner, and they need a large fenced yard in which to roam. For these reasons, goats require an advanced level of care.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Goat</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:16 to 35 inches tall at shoulder, 35 to 300 pounds (depending on breed)</p><p>Life Expectancy:15 to 18 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Goat? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Check the zoning regulations in your area to ensure that pet goats can be kept within the town or city limits. There may also be restrictions regarding goat size or weight. Also, some municipalities regulate how close animals can be kept to dwellings or neighboring properties. If you are in close proximity to your neighbors, check that they will be tolerant of pet goats as these animals can be quite loud.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>As long as goats are kept in clean, spacious conditions with access to fresh water and proper food, there is very little question about the ethics of keeping them. Goats have lived as domestic animals in the company of humans for thousands of years, so they are well suited to the role.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>There are over 300 breeds of goats in the world, and they come in all sizes-some with horns and others without. Different goat breeds have different temperaments as well, so it's a good idea to research these factors when choosing which breed to buy. Consider which breed would best suit your home environment and your family.</p><p>You must be prepared for a long-term commitment when keeping goats. They need attention like any other pet. You must alsoconsider who can look after the goats when you are away.</p><h2>Goat Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Goats are herd animals, so they should never be kept as solitary animals. A pair (or more) of goats will make a good addition to the right family. Most pet goats tend to like attention, petting from their owners, and even eating out of your hand. Try to give your goats equal amounts of affection because they are intelligent animals that can get jealous and moderately aggressive if one goat is favored over others.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Goats are best suited to rural farms or homes with acreage. A large amount of space (a big yard or pasture) will be necessary, depending on the breed and number of goats. If you live in a city, bylaws may prevent you from keeping goats as they will likely be classified as an agricultural species.</p><p>Smaller breeds of goats, such as the pygmies, need at least 135 square feet per goat. Larger standard goat breeds, such as Nubians, need twice that much space per goat, so plan accordingly. The square footage of the space needs to be multiplied by the number of goats you have, since they need room to move around each other. Enclosure fencing of at least 4 to 5 feet high is also a necessity for all goats, as they are very agile and good jumpers.</p><p>The living space needs areas that provide both sun and shade, as well as protection from rain, snow, and wind. Goat shelters or barns should ideally be draft-free and have doors that can close to protect the goats from predators at night. If the enclosure or barn has windows, they should be higher than the head of the tallest goat when standing on its hind feet. Otherwise, the window should be covered with bars to prevent the goats from putting their head through the window or trying to climb through and potentially hurting themselves. Inside the enclosure, a mother goat (doe) will need a smaller stall if she is raising baby goats (kids).</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>A simple dirt floor works well in goat bars. If your barn has a concrete or wood floor, consider adding rubber mats that will be more comfortable for your goats.</p><h2>What Do Goats Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Despite their reputation, goats are picky eaters. They prefer to eat food that has not been soiled or fallen on the ground, so use an above-ground feeder. Though they tend to browse on grass, weeds, and shrubs, the standard backyard will not have enough foliage for a goat's entire diet. Supplement their diet with hay, grains, and greens. If you are going to keep goats near gardens, be sure to avoid planting roses and other toxic plants, such as azaleas, rhododendron, mountain laurel, and ferns.</p><p>Goats eat a large volume of food every day. Be prepared to haul heavy hay bales. They also require high protein grain and supplemental minerals, especially copper. This is often provided as a loose powder or as a compressed brick salt lick. Goats also need plenty of clean water, freshened daily. Consult with an exotics or farm animal veterinarian on the best foods for your goat; do not assume that foods labeled for other barnyard animals are safe for goats.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Find an exotics or farm animal veterinarian who will be available to serve your goats. Goatsare susceptible to a number of infectious and chronic diseases. Vaccinations and routine preventative treatment for worms and other parasites are necessary for all goats, and you should consult local veterinarians regarding what is required in your area.</p> <h2>Exercise </h2><p>As long as goats have adequate space, they will run, jump, and get all of the exercise they need naturally. Goats love to climb, and they will appreciate a rock pile or even playground equipment to test their skills.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>To keep your goats' coats in tip-top condition, brush them with a dog brush or horse curry comb. Brushing will help them shed loose hair as well as dirt and burs they may pick up while roaming their field.</p><p>In addition to brushing, it is very important to keep goats' hooves trimmed. If they don't run around on rocky ground all the time, goats' hooves will grow like human fingernails. If they get too long, they can curl or crack, causing pain and increasing the odds of infection. Goats' hooves should be trimmed every six to eight weeks. If you're unsure of how to care for your goats' hooves, contact a farrier or your veterinarian for assistance.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>The smallest goat breed in the world is the Nigerian dwarf goat. Females (does) are only about 17 to 19 inches tall at the shoulder, while males (bucks) are about 19 to 20 inches tall.At the opposite end of the size spectrum, the Boer goat is the largest breed. On average, they are about 30 inches tall.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Goat as a Pet </h2><p>Goats are fun! They enjoy interacting with humans, are easy to feed, will eat weeds, and don't take up too much space. The potential negatives of owning goats generally involve noise (goats bleat loudly when they want attention) and upkeep, like regularly trimming their hooves. Does are easier to keep than bucks because intact male goats tend to be rather stinky, and they are persistently in pursuit of does, which can be annoying and stressful for your herd.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Goat </h2><p>Obtain goats from conscientious breeders who practice good preventive healthcare. It is always best to visit the breeder so you can observe the conditions their goats are kept in; ask to see test results for CAE and other diseases. Prior to bringing home pet goats, think about whether you can meet the needs of a whole herd, or even two of these lively animals. Goats can make great pets for energetic owners, and if you decide to become a goat owner, begin the journey by picking out the perfect names for your new friends.</p>",1367

There are four breeds of coati, but only two the white-nosed and South American coatis are sometimes kept as pets.</p><p>Coatisare omnivores with a lot of energy, a curious streak, and, just like their North American cousins, they forage for food in the wild. Some people opt to care for them as pets, but these wild animals are not ideal for most households.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Coatimundi, coati, hog-nosed coon</p> <p>ADULT SIZE: 7 to 14 pounds</p><p>LIFESPAN: About 14 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Coatimundi? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>As with other exotic pets, coatimundis are regulated by law. Because this species has caused injury to humans and can transmit diseases, many places outlaw them. States and counties have laws and regulations regarding coatimundis, and you need to know what the law is where you plan to live with your pet. In addition to knowing whether coati ownership is legal, it's also essential to ascertain whether you will need a permit.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Coatis are wild animals that are used to living in the wild, not in enclosures. No matter how much you try to replicate their natural habitat, it will never be the same as the way these animals live when they're not in captivity.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>If you're set on having a coati, you need to be sure you can provide the kind of life it would have in the wild: the right housing, the correct diet, and the time to devote to your new pet. (Hint: coatis are way more work than cats and dogs.)</p><p>You cannot allow children to play with coatis as they can and do bite. In general, this type of animal is not considered the right pet for most people.</p><h2>Coatimundi Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>South Americanraccoons are unlike North American raccoons; they are diurnal and are active during the day. Males are solitary in the wild and are usually larger than females, which tend to live in groups.</p><p>Male coatis can become very aggressive once they are sexually mature. Neutering is recommended before 6 months of age to curb some of the aggression. Females can become aggressive when they are in heat; for a more even-tempered coati, spay it.</p><p>Owning a coatimundi is something like caring for a permanent toddler with sharp claws and teeth that has a fantastic ability to climb, swim, and get into mischief. If coatis aren't bottle-raised at a young age and continually socialized, they can become violent and dangerous, much like a pet primate. Whenever handling one, you will need to wear thick, protective gloves to prevent scratches from fidgeting or scurrying coati.</p><p>Although declawing and tooth removal may seem like good options for safeguarding your family against bites and scratches, it is very unnatural and not appropriate to do to any animal, including a coati. If you can't handle the sharp teeth and claws of a coati, then you should not have one as a pet.</p><p>To increase your chances of having a loving and enjoyable pet, provide your coati with plenty of enrichment, exercise, and attention.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Coatis are high-energy animals that need a lot of space, especially at a young age. Even with appropriate housing, some coatis can become stressed; the result can be poor health and low energy.</p><p>Ideally, coatis should have a large indoor and outdoor enclosure; at least 10-foot, cubed. Equip the cages with toys and challenging climbing areas to keep your pet engaged and active. Another good enclosure option is repurposing a walk-in aviary (formerly used for parrots, wild birds, or small flocks).</p><p>Coatis are intelligent animals. Some owners do put their coatis on leashes and take them outdoors, though this can be tricky if the coati becomes stubborn and refuses to comply with commands.</p><p>It's not advisable to keep a coati loose indoors. It will damage your home and may injure itself.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Good substrates are comprised on gravel, sand, or even concrete paver tiles. They will need to be cleaned on a daily basis.</p><h2>What do Coatimundis Eat and Drink </h2><p>Pet coatis abide by a strict diet. Your pet will require measured dietary ratios of fruits to vegetables to proteins and carbohydrates: 60 percent high-grade, grain-free dog food; 10 percent fresh fruit; 20 percent poultry, beef, or eggs; 10 percent vegetables (and more as necessary)</p><p>Treats can include gut-loaded crickets andmealworms, cereal, or crackers. Coatis favor prickly pear fruits; they are a great option as a training reward.</p><p>Avoid overly sweet or salty foods when giving your coati treats. Diseases related to poor diets, food aggression, or picky eating can develop if you spoil your coati with these foods.</p><p>When feeding coatis, scatter food about their enclosure and hide it inside and under objects to encourage natural foraging behavior. Feed at least twice a day and add a third feeding if it appears to continue to forage for food.</p><p>Use heavy bowls made from metal or a sturdy, non-chewable plastic for water and wet foods. Small pools with running water work well as a watering hole. Clean and disinfect all food and water containers daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Your coati will need an experienced exotics veterinarian for annual checkups. Coatis rarely have medical issues, although they are prone to getting a rectal prolapse from straining to defecate due to parasites or diarrhea.</p><p>An improper diet will likely cause malnutrition. And, if you house multiple coatis together, fighting can cause injuries. There are no licensed vaccines for coatis but many veterinarians will use dog or cat vaccines.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Coatis will need ways to exercise in their enclosure: lots of rope, trees, and platforms to climb on.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Coatimundis groom themselves, or each other. Unless yours starts to look unkempt and that would really be something you should discuss with your vet then there's nothing for you to do.</p><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Like most furry animals, coatis shed. Yours may or may not allow you to gently brush it, but don't count on it (and wear thick, protective, leather gloves if you do).</p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>You do not need to bathe your coati, it will do this job itself.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Full-grown coatis are fully grown at around 15 months, and weigh from seven to 14 pounds. They're 20 to 24 inches long, not including their tails which can be longer than their bodies!</p><h2>Training Your Coatimundi </h2><p>Coatis are very smart animals, like their raccoon cousins. The earlier you get them, the easier it will be to train them.</p><h3>Leash Training </h3><p>Coatimundis can be trained to walk on a leash with a harness, if you start doing this with them when they are young.</p><h3>Potty Training </h3><p>With training and patience, they can be litter trained.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Coatimundi as a Pet </h2><p>Coatis can be fun pets: they're intelligent and affectionate, and will get along with your cats and dogs. They're easily fed and they have no aroma. However, there are downsides: male coatimundis become very aggressive, very early, and must be spayed or neutered early. They have sharp, destructive claws, as well as a mouthful of sharp teeth. They need a good deal of stimulation, and you'll need to baby-proof anywhere these little mongrels hang out.</p>",1189

Also called the striped-knee tarantula, it features a black body, deep red hairs, white stripes on its legs, and orange spinnerets. As a pet, it doesn't require much maintenance outside of feedings each week and periodic habitat cleanings. But, due to its skittish nature and ability to move quickly, handling can be difficult.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Costa Rican zebra tarantula, striped-knee tarantula</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size: Leg span of 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Lifespan: 15 to 20 years (females), 5 years (males)</p><h2>Costa Rican Zebra Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Costa Rican zebra tarantulas can move very fast, making them a poor candidate for those who like to handle their pet spiders. While they are generally docile in demeanor, they can dart quickly when startled and be very difficult to catch and contain. Trying to capture or even just pick up this type of spider can lead to injury. However, some experienced owners are able to gently handle their Costa Rican zebra tarantulas.</p><p>These tarantulas are not prone to biting but sometimes will if they feel threatened. And it's important to note that they do have toxic venom. Plus, they are able to flick barbed hairs off their abdomen at perceived threats, which can irritate skin and damage eyes. So always wash your hands after touching your spider or anything in its environment, and be careful not to rub your eyes.</p><p>While their speed and defense mechanisms do complicate their care, these spiders still are relatively easy to maintain. Plan to spend a few hours per week on feedings and cleaning. Plus, they are quiet and solitary animals that don't need you for socialization. In fact, they prefer to be housed alone and should not be exposed to other household pets to avoid stress and injury.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Costa Rican zebra tarantulas have a venomous bite that can cause irritation similar to a bee sting in most people. However, some people might have more serious reactions and should seek prompt medical attention.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>The Costa Rican zebra tarantula has a leg span of between 4 and 5 inches on average, though the leg span can stretch up to 6 inches.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A 5- to 10-gallon aquarium is suitable for Costa Rican zebra tarantulas. The length of the tank should be roughly three times the spider's leg span, and the width should be two to three times the leg span. A height of about a foot should be fine. There also are spider terrariums available that are specifically designed for the tarantula's safety and easy access to the enclosure for you.</p><p>In the habitat, add a hollow log, cork bark, half of a small clay flowerpot on its side, or a store-bought spider house for shelter. Various climbing supports, such as fake plants and vines, should also be situated throughout the enclosure.</p><p>The temperature of your spider's habitat should hover around 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 30 degrees Celsius) with a humidity level of 75 to 80 percent. Supplemental heat is usually not necessary unless you keep your house cool. In this case, place a specially designed heating pad underneath only one side of your spider's habitat. This allows your pet to move to a cooler location should it need to escape the warmth. Evaporation from your spider's water dish should provide enough relative humidity. But if the humidity measures too low on a hydrometer, you can mist the enclosure.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The substrate on the tank's bottom should be at least 4 inches thick and consist of a mix of peat moss, chemical-free soil, or vermiculite. Plan to change the substrate every four to six months.</p><h2>What Do Costa Rican Zebra Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Like most tarantulas, this carnivore prefers eating live prey; it has a strong affinity for crickets. It can also eat other insects as long as they are smaller than the spider's body. Plus, you can offer the occasional pinky mouse for added protein.</p><p>Consult with your vet for the right feeding schedule for your particular spider, as this can vary slightly based on age and size. Adult Costa Rican zebra tarantulas typically eat once or twice a week, and juveniles eat every one to two days. To feed, drop the live prey in near your spider. Remove any unwanted prey after 24 hours, or it can begin to stress your spider. Also, remove any leftover remains to keep the habitat sanitary.</p><p>Provide an accessible shallow water dish as both a drinking and humidity source for your tarantula. Make sure your spider can easily get in and out of the dish to prevent drowning. Change the water daily. Also, scoop out any substrate that gets wet to prevent bacterial and fungal growth.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Pet tarantulas are usually hardy animals that seldom fall ill if they are kept in the right environment and properly fed and hydrated. However, damaging or deadly falls are a threat, especially for the fast-moving Costa Rican zebra tarantula. So it's critical to make sure your tarantula's enclosure is secure and you do any handling with extreme care preferably sitting in a secure spot over a carpeted floor.</p><p>If your spider refuses to eat, acts listless, and is lying on its back with its legs in the air, you generally don't have to worry. These are signs of imminent molting an natural occurrence in whicha spider sheds its old exoskeleton and forms a new one. Don't handle your pet or feed live prey during a molt, as this can damage the fragile new exoskeleton. The whole process typically takes a few weeks.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not every veterinarian sees tarantula patients. So before you bring home a Costa Rican zebra tarantula, make sure there is a vet in your area who will treat it.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>While tarantulas are generally restful animals, they do still need physical activity to remain in good body condition. As long as you provide a large enough enclosure, your pet tarantula should be able to get the exercise it needs.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Tarantulas generally don't need any help from you in the grooming department. Molting is essentially how they groom themselves. And as long as you minimize stress and keep their environment at the proper temperature and humidity during this time, they should be able to molt without issue.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>The tarantula's diet will be your primary cost. On a monthly basis, expect to spend around $5 to $10, though you can diminish this by raising crickets yourself instead of buying them at a pet store. For periodic substrate changes and replacing worn items in the tank, plan to spend around $10 to $20. Furthermore, don't forget to budget for routine and emergency vet care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Costa Rican Zebra Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Costa Rican zebra tarantulas make for unusual and interesting pets. They are quiet and don't take up a lot of space. And they don't require much of your time. However, you do have to be careful of their defense mechanisms when keeping them. And they can be fast-moving, which can make handling difficult.</p><h2>Similar Spiders to the Costa Rican Zebra Tarantula </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother tarantulasthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Costa Rican Zebra Tarantula </h2><p>It is possible to find Costa Rican zebra tarantulas at some pet stores, but it's best to purchase one from a reputable breeder or rescue organization. That way, you'll be more likely to get accurate information about the animal's health and history. Plan to spend between $20 and $40 on average, though this can vary based on the animal's age and other factors. Also, females typically cost more because they have a longer lifespan.</p>",1282

Southern flying squirrels are the smallest of the tree squirrels, but their northern cousins (a larger species) are also kept as pets. Southern flying squirrels are primarily nocturnal, with large, round eyes that help them see at night. They live in trees and glide from tree to tree, using a flap of furry skin between their legs like a parachute. Southern flying squirrels will spend time with you if there's a pouch or pocket available and, if raised from a young age, they can form a deep attachment with you.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Southern flying squirrel</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:8 to 10 inches long, including the tail; between 2 to 4 ounces</p><p>Lifespan:10 to 15 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Southern Flying Squirrel? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Check the legality of keeping a southern flying squirrel as a pet in your state, as the laws vary and change over time. Even if owning one is legal where you live, you may be required to acquire special permitting or paperwork in order to validate your ownership. Be sure to explore all legal stipulations before acquiring a southern flying squirrel as a pet the last thing you want is having your pet taken away from you due to illegal ownership.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>When it comes to ethically owning a southern flying squirrel, a lot of it comes down to both how you source your pet and whether you can properly care for it. Beyond ensuring that you go to a reputable breeder, you should make sure you can provide your squirrel with everything it needs to not just survive but thrive under your care. This includes everything from time and attention to the financial ability to buy what you need for it. Additionally, southern flying squirrels can be injured or even killed by other pets (especially cats) so do not get one if you have a mischievous pet in the home.</p><h2>Southern Flying Squirrel Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Like sugar gliders, southern flying squirrels form an intense bond with their owners if they're acquired at a young age. They are usually quite happy to spend time climbing and playing on their owner, almost as though you're a human tree. They'll even seek out safety and comfort in the sleeves or pockets of your clothing.</p><p>Bonding pouches are essential in helping create a strong attachment between an owner and a southern flying squirrel and are often used throughout the life of the squirrel.Even though they are primarily nocturnal creatures, southern flying squirrels can spend an entire day sleeping in an owner's pouch or pocket. If you intend to remain bonded to your pet, expect your pet will want to be with you all day long. If this time commitment is not possible, get two squirrels so that your pet does not get lonely.</p><p>Squirrels that are not hand-reared or handled much may bite if scared and can be very fast and skittish. It can be nearly impossible to tame a wild, adult southern flying squirrel in fact, it's is rare to even see them in the wild, since they move so quickly and are very shy.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Southern flying squirrels are not large, so they can make do with a reasonably small cage. However, they will need ample room to run and climb in order to thrive. Vertical space is more important than floor space, so a tall cage is best. An enclosure designed for sugar gliders can work well, as long as the spacing in the mesh is narrow (1/2-inch by 1-inch at most). Some owners find that a homemade cage works well too.</p><p>Southern flying squirrels are excellent chewers, so make sure they cannot bite their way out of their cage (wire or metal is preferred). A floor space of 2-feet by 2-feet is adequate and the minimum height should be 3 feet tall (but up to 5 or 6 feet tall is even better).</p><p>Provide your squirrel with branches in their cage for climbing and chewing. Cotton ropes hung in the cage can also provide anopportunity for climbing and play. A running wheel is good to provide for exercise. A solid-surface wheel is the safest choice for flying squirrels because of its long tails.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Offer nest boxes with facial tissues or paper towelsas nesting material (avoid anything with threads that could wrap around a leg and cause injury) and line the bottom of their cage with bedding or litter appropriate for rodents.</p><h2>What Do Southern Flying Squirrels Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, southern flying squirrels eat a variety of nuts, seeds, fruits, and insects. In captivity, they do well with a varied diet that can include nuts (pine nuts, pecans, walnuts, acorns, hickory nuts), seeds (pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds), birdseed mixes, hamster pellets, mealworms, moths, waxworms, and a variety of fresh veggies (corn, sweet potatoes, mushrooms).</p><p>In captivity, feed your pet the equivalent of about 1 tablespoon of food in the morning and at night. Because they are foragers, you can place food in a couple of small cups in areas where you know the squirrel does not regularly defecate so they can seek it out. Remove any uneaten food after 12 hours. You can add occasional treats of hard-boiled egg or chicken for more protein in their diet.</p><p>Since southern flying squirrels are susceptible to calcium deficiency, include a supplement of calcium and vitamin D3 (important in calcium metabolism) with their food. Limit items that may be high in phosphorous, since it binds calcium in the body. Provide a calcium block or cuttlebone along with a mineral block. These food supplements double as tooth files since their teeth continuously grow.</p><p>Baby squirrels are usually not fully weaned when you get them. You will need to give them goat's milk or a puppy milk replacement formula through a syringe or an eyedropper three times a day until they're completely weaned (around 6 to 8 weeks of age). Adult southern flying squirrels can have problems with sipper tubes on water bottles, so provide a shallow bowl of clean water available in your squirrel's cage at all times.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Southern flying squirrels do not need any routine vaccinations and are not susceptible to any well-known diseases. It is common for them to develop calcium deficiency problems, but a calcium block in the cage can help prevent those issues.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Southern flying squirrels need a good amount of exploring and exercise, but since they're so small, most of this can be done within the confines of their own cage. However, they also thrive with time out of their cage, as long as they're closely supervised to prevent injury. In-cage toys and activities are also an easy way to keep your squirrel active.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Healthy southern flying squirrels will groom themselves regularly, and a lack of grooming can indicate other issues with your pet. That being said, you should never bathe your squirrel or submerge them in water they can easily go into a state of shock or hypothermia. If you need to clean your squirrel for some reason, you can spot clean them with baby wipes or baby powder.</p><h2>Training Your Southern Flying Squirrel </h2><p>When it comes to training your souther flying squirrel, you shouldn't expect much. You won't be able to train your squirrel to do much beyond be comfortably handled and perhaps cozy into your clothing. Offer treats as incentive to get your squirrel comfortable with handling and being out of their cage.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Southern Flying Squirrel </h2><p>Before you buy a southern flying squirrel, make sure you have a local exotic veterinarian who can treat your pet if emergencies arise. Exotic veterinarians are often an excellent place to start for a referral for local, verifiable breeders. If these squirrels are local in your area, do not attempt to take one in from the wild. In most cases, it is illegal to do so.</p>",1315

As pets, these spiders are favored for their beauty, generally docile temperament, and long lifespan. They often make good pets for first-time spider owners. Plus, their housing doesn't take up much space, and their diet is relatively straightforward.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Mexican red-knee tarantula</p><p>Scientific Names: or</p><p>Adult Size: Leg span of around 5 inches, weighing 0.5 ounce</p><p>Lifespan: 25 to 30 years (female), 5 to 10 years (male)</p><h2>Mexican Red-Knee Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The Mexican red-knee tarantula is one of the most docile and calm pet tarantulas, making it ideal for beginner arachnid keepers. This spider rarely bites. However, it's important to note that its bite is venomous. And like most tarantulas, it will eject urticating hairs from its abdomen and legs if it thinks it's in danger. These hairs can embed in the skin and cause irritation; they also can be seriously damaging if they get in your eyes. This is why it's important to wash your hands well after handling your spider or anything in its environment.</p><p>Still, many Mexican red-knee tarantulas are comfortable with gentle handling, though they don't need the socialization. It's important to sit on the floor when handling one, as an accidental drop from even a few feet can be seriously damaging.Keep handling sessions brief to avoid unnecessary stress.</p><p>Moreover, they are quiet pets that sit in a restful state for much of the time. They should be housed individually and kept away from other household pets to prevent injury and stress. Plan to spend a few hours per week on feedings and keeping the enclosure clean.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Mexican red-knee tarantula bites are venomous. The venom typically causes a local reaction that's similar to a bee sting. However, allergies can cause more serious reactions in certain people.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Mexican red-knee tarantulas have a leg span of around 5 inches, and they weigh roughly 0.5 ounce. The females are generally slightly larger than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Keep your tarantula in a glass or plastic aquarium with a secure top that has ventilation. As a general rule, the tank should be roughly two to three times wider than the spider's leg span and roughly as tall as the leg span. Ideally it should have a side opening. Tarantulas like to hang upside down at the top of the tank, so this will prevent the spider from falling each time you need to service the tank.</p><p>Maintaining a consistent temperature and humidity level is an important element of Mexican red-knee tarantula care. The recommended terrarium temperature is around 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit and can be achieved by using a heat mat under one portion of the tank. While supplemental heating is recommended for most North American terrarium environments, it's also important to give your spider an unheated area to cool off should the tank get too hot.</p><p>Keep the humidity level at 60 to 70 percent, which can usually be achieved through evaporation from a water bowl. However, in some dryer homes, misting the tank might be necessary. If you see your spider hovering over its water bowl but not drinking, chances are your environment is too dry. Conversely, if it's continuously hiding out in a far corner of the terrarium, your enclosure is probably too humid.You can measure the tank humidity with a hygrometer.</p><p>Within the tank, wood, cork bark, or half of a small clay flower pot can provide good shelter for the tarantula.Adding a few fake plants also helps mimic its natural environment.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The substrate, or bedding in the tank, should be a mix of peat moss, soil, and vermiculite. Make it at least 4 inches thick and loosely packed to allow for burrowing and to dampen any falls.</p><h2>What Do Mexican Red-Knee Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Live crickets will be a staple in your Mexican red-knee tarantula's diet. These spiders also eat roaches, locusts, and other insects. A pinky mouse or a small lizard may be fed occasionally as a protein boost, but make sure to clean the remains from the tank immediately. Also, remove any uneaten live insects, as their constant movement can stress your pet spider once it's full.</p><p>Mexican red-knee tarantulas usually eat once or twice a week. Consult your vet on how much and how often to feed, as this can vary based on factors such as age and size. To feed, simply drop the prey in the tank. This is best done in the evening when the spider is more active.</p><p>The tarantula also needs access to fresh water at all times both for hydration and humidity. Add a shallow water dish that your spider can easily get in and out of to the enclosure. Refresh the water every day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Most pet tarantulas are hardy creatures that rarely fall ill when kept in the proper environment. Accidental falls are one of the biggest dangers to their health, which is why a secure enclosure and careful handling are so important.</p><p>As with all tarantulas, the red-knee tarantula will go through the molting process to shed its old exoskeleton and grow a new one. During this time, spiders often refuse to eat and might lie immobile on their back. It can look startling and appear as though the spider is sick or dying, but it's all normal. Avoid handling your spider during this time. And don't feed any live prey for about a week after the molt is complete, as even a cricket can damage the fragile new exoskeleton.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians treat tarantulas. So before acquiring one as a pet, make sure there's a vet nearby who specializes in this animal.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Just like with any animal, physical activity is important to keep a Mexican red-knee tarantula in good body condition. However, this spider doesn't need a great deal of exercise. As long as you provide a large enough tank, it should be able to get all the activity it needs.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Tarantulas essentially ""groom"" themselves via molting. They typically don't require any help from you besides making sure their environment is at the right temperature and humidity and keeping live prey away from them until their new exoskeleton has hardened.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>From month to month, the primary cost for a Mexican red-knee tarantula will be its food. Plan to spend between $5 and $10 on average. You can diminish this cost by raising crickets yourself instead of purchasing them from a pet shop. Occasional substrate changes can cost between $10 and $20 on average. Also, make sure to budget for veterinary checkups and emergency care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Mexican Red-Knee Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Mexican red-knee tarantulas are interesting, quiet, and low-maintenance pets. They also don't take up a lot of space.

In the wild, they live in communities of up to 100, much like prairie dogs. These social, curious animals are one of the few rodents that are awake during the day (diurnal), which adds to their pet appeal.</p><h3>What Is a Degu?</h3><p>A degu is a small, burrowing rodent native to Chile that makes a great pet.</p><p>They are great nappers, but once they get used to your schedule, these little creatures will come to greet you, often looking to play or get some belly rubs. They crave social interaction and exercise.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAME: Degu</p> <p>ADULT SIZE: 9 to 12 inches long, weighing 6 to 11 ounces</p><p>LIFESPAN: 6 to 8 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Degu? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Some places consider degusas a potentially invasive species and forbid owning them as a pet. They are illegal to own in multiple states within the United States. Before committing to buying one, check with city and state regulations where you live. Some places may require a permit or health certificate.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>If you can give your degu the larger amount of space it needs, and can think about adopting more than one so yours has company they're pretty affordable plus you're patient enough to train it to behave in a tame manner, a degu might just be the pet for your family.</p><h2>DeguBehavior and Temperament </h2><p>Similar to hedgehogs and other wild rodents, degus are easily tamed when handled from an early age. They do best housed in same-sex pairs with other degus, and are instinctively social.Degusare playful and curious. If they do not get sufficient social interaction and exercise, they can become aggressive and neurotic.</p><p>Some degus will attempt to converse with you using chitter-chatter sounds. Occasionally, you may hear high-pitched screeches when threatened, stressed, or if they get their food stolen. If hand trained from birth, they may come to you for cuddles or belly scratches.</p><p>Degusrarely resort tobitingunless feeling cornered or threatened. Adegu nip while playing shouldn't hurt or break the skin. It's only when it is in defensive mode and it fears for its life that adeguwillbitehard. Only then may it hurt and cause an injury.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Do not pick a degu up by its tail. A built-in anti-predator mechanism allows these rodents to shed their tailsin an emergency. This is often quite painful for your pet, and, unfortunately, the tail will never grow back.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Degus need a large cage. A minimum cage size of 24 inches by 18 inches by 24 inches should house two degus comfortably. The larger, the better. Multilevel cages built for ferrets or chinchillas are ideal. The surfaces should be solid and not wire slats.</p><p>Degus are avid chewers. Make sure the enclosure is made of wire or metal; they can eat their way through wood and plastic. A degu enclosure should have a nesting box to replicate the burrows they dig in the wild. A 6- by 8-inch wooden box with a flat roof to sit on should work.</p><p>Degus need a solid-surface exercise wheel (12 inches in diameter). Thick branches also make great playscapes for climbing along with cotton ropes.</p><p>Since degus are determined chewers, chewing opportunities thwart boredom and keep teeth healthy. A variety of woodblocks and chew toys designed explicitly for rodents should be offered and changed out often.Willow balls and toys made for rabbits or parrots also work. A mineral or salt block designed for rodents is another nice distraction while providing your pet with extra nutrients.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Provide nesting material in the form of tissues, paper towels, hay, or shredded paper. Paper-based bedding is safer and just as absorbent when changed out regularly.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>As with other small animals, avoid using cedar or pine shavings, as the scent can be toxic.</p><h2>What Do Degus Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Degus eat a diet high in roughage and low in carbohydrates. Thus, the basis of a proper degu diet is a combination of high-quality chinchilla or guinea pig pelletsand a rodent block. Make nutrient-rich grass, like Timothy hay or alfalfa, available at all times. Provide fresh vegetables daily, such as sweet potato (peeled, uncooked), carrots, leafy greens (spinach, dandelion leaves, parsley), and green beans every day.</p><p>Avoid giving your degu cruciferousvegetables like cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale. Their systems can't handle these veggies in excess. Do not feed fruit; its sugar content is too high.</p><p>For occasional treats, you can offer sunflower seeds, peanuts, and whole nuts in the shell (sparingly, due to high-fat content).</p><p>Your degu needs clean, fresh water available at all times. Use a heavy ceramic dish for a water bowl or a water bottle with a metal tube that has a chew guard.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Degus are generally healthy, but they can be susceptible to a few conditions: Due to their natural insulin resistance, degus are prone to diabetes. Telltale signs of this disease include fat rolls and the development of cataracts.</p><p>They also get bumblefoot, a bacterial infection that causes foot sores; it requires antibiotics for treatment. Mouth and dental diseases are common (like tooth spurs; provide safe chewable toys to prevent this painful mouth condition; skin conditions like dry skin, which can be prevented by offering your pet a regular dust bath; and respiratory illnesses, which may be preventable by keeping their enclosure clean to prevent unsanitary conditions. Also watch for pawing, eating difficulties, and weepy eyes. Contact your exotics vet if any unusual symptoms come up.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Degus enjoy running around their cages but they also love an exercise wheel, provided it's one they won't chew through. They like saucer disk toys, which are similar to wheels but spin below them. Degus also like bridges they can climb, which can be incorporated into their cages, the same with ropes and tunnels and branches they can climb on or through.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Degus do shed, or more like molt, once a year. If you see it happening more frequently, give a call to your vet.</p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>Like chinchillas, degus need regular dust baths to keep their skin and coat in good condition. Provide your pet with a shallow bowl containing an inch or two of animal bath dust or bath sand. Leave this in the cage for half an hour to give it ample time to roll around. Repeat dust baths biweekly.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Degus are small, around 9 to 12 inches long and weighing a mere 6 to 11 ounces.</p><h2>Training Your Degu </h2><p>With some patience, your degus can be trained to be tame enough to be held or cuddled.</p><h3>Potty Training </h3><p>It's likely impossible to litter train your degu, they are peeing and pooping machines (though sometimes they do most of their business in their cage's corner).</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Degu as a Pet </h2><p>Degus are affectionate and easy to care for; they need no grooming help, will get along with your other pets, and enjoy your company. On the negative side, they need food all the time, they chew on everything, and really need another degu as a companion because they need a lot more attention than most household pets.</p>",1195
43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/llamas-1236919,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Llama As a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Llama As a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Many people would not consider llamas pets in the traditional sense. Strictly speaking, they're considered livestock however, because they're friendly, social, calm, and easily trained, they're often a great option for people looking for a more exotic companion. Many times, llama ownership arises from a case of ""love at first sight."" Of course, they are not for everyone, and given their size and needs, are only appropriate for those with enough room to house them and care for them properly.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Llama</p> <p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 feet tall (to top of head); 250-450 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Llama? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Owning a pet llama is typically allowed in most areas however, it's always a good idea to check with state and local ordinances in your area before pursuing pet ownership. In some areas, llamas may be considered livestock and come with zoning regulations that restrict their size, number, or how close they can be to your home (or a neighbor's).</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Because llamas take a lot of care and attention, it's important to consider if you have the time and means necessary to own one. In addition to being able to properly care for your llama, you should ensure you acquire your pet ethically, either through a certified rescue organization or a reputable breeder.</p><h2>Llama Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Llamas are social animals and, if properly socialized from a young age,they can make very calm, gentle companions. They have a reputation for spitting, but this is more typical between llamas and usually not directed at people (unless poorly socialized). They also make a variety of sounds and can actually act as a guard for sheep and other livestock, fending off a lone dog or coyote and alerting owners to problems.</p><p>Llamas are very curious and will approach most people easily and unprompted. They will take a bit to warm up to you, but once you gain their trust they are happy to have you with them in their enclosure, around the yard, etc. Owning more than one llama is fine as they're herd animals, but you should be aware of various behavioral issues that can arise as they fight for dominance, such as spitting, neck wrestling, kicking, and ramming each other.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>The amount and type of shelter you provide for your llama is very dependent on your climate. In cold weather, an enclosure like a barn or other windproof housing may be necessary to keep your llama comfortable, while in warmer climates, a three-sided shelter would likely do the trick. In really hot areas, a roofed area with open sides is more effective to allow cooling airflow. Additionally, they'll need plenty of room to run and roam for exercise.</p><p>Proper fencing is also necessary to keep llamas in and other animals out. The complexity of the fence depends on your situation, like the number of llamas (or other pets) you have and how important it is to keep them separate. Llamas do best with a companion another llama of similar age is best (and unless you want a breeding farm, the same sex, too).</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>In their enclosure, llamas should have a dry and warm spot to rest. Typically this can either be lined with straw, wood shavings, or wood chips however, llamas love to roll in wood chips and they can stick in their fur for quite a long time.</p><p>Nutritional requirements and information on feeding are available on the LlamaOrg site. They can be fed on pasture as long as it is free from poisonous plants (as for cattle, sheep). Hay and complete rations are also acceptable. The type of feed available and what should be fed will vary by area. Also, supplementation with vitamins and mineral will depend on the area and is best discussed with a veterinarian or agriculture extension specialist. Ample fresh water is absolutely essential at all times.</p><h2>What Do Llamas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Llamas can eat pretty much anything, which makes them fairly easy to feed. If you have a yard or landscape where your llama can roam freely, they may just fill up on grasses already available to them. If a natural pasture is not available to them, you can feed your llama a fresh supply of hay, along with commercially-available llama food.</p><p>Llamas also need plenty of fresh, clean water available to them daily. You should plan to supplement your llama's diet with a salt or mineral supplement for the proper nutrients corn can also be added to their diet around the winter to help them maintain the proper weight and energy levels throughout the season. Keep a general eye on how much your llama eats they can easily overeat if they have food readily available to them at all times. If you have any concerns with how much your llamas should be eating, you can consult your veterinarian.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Llamas are pretty hardy animals but should have a vaccine schedule designed by a veterinarian based on potential disease threats in your area (which often overlap with diseases and parasites cattle and sheep are prone to). In general, though, they are quite hardy and do well as long as veterinary care is sought early on if something does go wrong. Just know that regular veterinary care will be required and may be expensive if health problems arise.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Provided that you give your llama plenty of room to roam, you should have their exercise needs covered. As a general rule of thumb, you should aim to have an acre of land for two to four llamas. Beyond general roaming and exploring, you shouldn't need to keep tabs on your llama's exercise schedule unless directed to do so by a vet.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Properly grooming a llama is a very in-depth job, so if you don't feel up to a lot of learning and time investment, it's best to hire the task out to a pro in your area. The quality of a llama's fur is a direct reflection on their overall health, so a proper diet and ample care is the first step in maintaining a llama's appearance. In general, llamas will need occasional brushing and sheering, as well as regular check-ups on their ears and teeth and toenail trimming.</p><p>In order to groom your llama adequately, you need to care for them in accordance with their fur type (a vet can give you insight into this). For instance, classic llamas can be brushed, while woolly llamas and those with Suri fiber (straight-looking fur) should not be. The same differentiation goes with shearing, so check with a local shearing expert before you commence with grooming your llama.</p><h2>Training Your Llama </h2><p>Llamas take well to elementary training methods, which may explain why they have been used for packing in South America for centuries their agility and calm nature make them excellent companions on even the wildest terrain. Chances are you aren't scaling a mountain with your llama any time soon, but they can be trained to walk on a leash or carry small items around your property.</p><p>Llamas also do well with kids and are becoming increasingly common as 4-H projects. Not only are they gentle and easy to handle, but theircalm nature makes them great in parades and public appearances. The llama show circuit is growing as well, with many different classes, as well as trials based on athletic abilities. They are even being used in animal-assisted therapy, where animals are taken to retirement homes and hospitals to reach out to residents and patients.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Llama </h2><p>You should always look to obtain your llama (or any pet) from a skilled and conscientious breeder that practices good preventive healthcare and has an excellent track record with previous generations of llamas under their care. It's always a good idea to visit the breeder whenever possible so you can observe the conditions their llamas are kept in. If you have trouble finding reputable breeders in your area, you can always reach out to livestock rescue foundations geared towards llamas to help unite you with your new pet.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Llama </h2> <p>Llamas take a lot of care and while none of it is particularly hard, it is time consuming. It's important to consider if you can manage to care and provide for a llama before adopting or purchasing one.</p><p>With proper care, llamas can live between 15 and 20 years in captivity, with some reaching as many as 30 years old.</p><p>Generally speaking, more llamas live within domestication (either in a farm environment or as true pets) than out in the ""wild."" They adapt very well to life alongside humans and other livestock and will thrive with the right care for many years to come.</p>",1447
44,https://www.thesprucepets.com/patagonian-cavy-care-1239554,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Patagonian Cavy (Mara) as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Patagonian Cavy (Mara) as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The Patagonian cavy is one of the more docile exotic pets. These large rodents are distantly related to guinea pigs and can be similarly kept in indoor cages, albeit much bigger, when not under supervision. Cavies are not noisy animals, they don't mind being petted, and they can be quite affectionate with their owners. Despite their large teeth, they are not known as biters. Plus, they are diurnal animals, so it's easier to keep them on a typical human schedule than nocturnal exotic pets. Some owners can even train their cavies to use a litter box and walk on a leash. If you can't walk your cavy regularly, it is important to have a spacious and secure outdoor enclosure where your cavy can play.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Patagonia cavy, mara, and dillaby</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:18 inches; up to 35 pounds</p><p>Lifespan:14 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Patagonian Cavy? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Many localities consider Patagonian cavies as rodents like hamsters and gerbils that can be privately owned as pets. Each state is different, though, and some may require a game breeder's license if you own more than one. As of 2020, only the state of Connecticut lists a ""Patagonian mara"" by name as being legal to own in the state. States that ban them or require permits include California, Georgia, New Hampshire, Colorado, and Hawaii. Laws do change frequently, so check with your state and local municipality to find out if it is legal to own a Patagonian cavy.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Because cavies are generally legal to own and adapt well to life as domestic pets, it is considered ethical to own one as long as you provide adequate space, exercise, and a proper diet for your pet.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>As with any pet, cavies require attentive care from their owners. They also have their own unique needs that must be met to maintain a healthy, happy pet. Because cavies have a relatively long lifespan, similar to a domestic cat, you must be prepared to make a long-term commitment to owning one.</p><h2>Patagonian Cavy Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>In the wild, Patagonian cavies are typically active during the day, which makes them a better pet than a nocturnal animal.</p><p>Though naturally skittish, a cavy can become socialized and affectionate if raised from a young age with lots of attention and human contact. They are not prone to biting, and a well-socialized cavy might even enjoy regular snuggles and belly rubs.</p><p>Male cavies may scent mark their territory, which can include your house, with urine and anal gland secretions. Females are less likely to engage in scent marking, so they probably make the better pets for most households. Cavies prefer to live in male-female bonded pairs in the wild, but if your cavy gets plenty of attention from you, it will probably be quite content.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>In the wild, Patagonian cavies are social animals that live in communities similar to prairie dog towns, which consist of many burrows. Usually, one pair of cavies inhabits each burrow. Because of their instinctive urge to burrow, they will also try to dig holes through flooring or furniture in your house. This behavior, as well as the fact they love to chew things, means that cavies should not be left unsupervised in a human home.</p><p>To house your cavy while you're not tending it, you'll need a secure enclosure that is large enough to comfortably contain your pet. If you don't have enough indoor space to accommodate a huge cage, then it's fine to build one outdoors as long as you provide an insulated ""den"" with heat lamps during cold weather.</p><p>The outdoor enclosure should be at least a 10-foot square with access to grass for grazing and a small dog house in which your pet can escape the elements. If the enclosure has no roof, then the perimeter fencing should be at least 7 feet high. Patagonian cavies have powerful hind legs; they can jump horizontally up to 6 feet high and run up to 25 miles an hour.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Since Patagonian cavies are expert diggers, they will be inclined to dig into the ground or flooring of their enclosure, which requires extra measures to prevent their subterranean escape. Some people keep cavies in concrete-floor pens, but that prevents the animals from having access to grass. Another method is to bury a chain-link fence ""floor"" a few feet below the ground so that your cavy can graze and even dig without escaping.</p><h2>What Do Patagonian Cavies Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Cavies are herbivores. Like guinea pigs, Patagonian cavies need 24-hour access to hay such as timothy hay, alfalfa, meadow hay, bluegrass, or oat hay. Hay helps them file down their back molars (a necessity for these rodents). In captivity, supplement the hay diet with commercially prepared rodent or guinea pig food. Dark, leafy greens (collards, dandelion leaves, parsley, kale) and fresh grass should make up the bulk of their diet. You can also occasionally offer sweet potatoes, apples, and squash as treats.</p><p>Additionally, like guinea pigs, they need supplemental vitamin C. You can sprinkle powdered vitamin C (the same used by humans) onto their food or purchase vitamin C-based treats for rodents at a pet store.</p><p>If you have more than one Patagonian cavy, provide multiple food stations to avoid aggression at feeding time. Use metal troughs or trays for feeding and watering because they are chew-proof.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Bone fractures are common injuries among captive cavies that are allowed to roam too freely, climbing onto furniture, porches, or decks. They are also prone to dental issues like overbites and mouth deformities due to overgrown teeth.</p><p>Cavies are susceptible to heart and gastrointestinal troubles. To check for any issues, make sure your animal has an annual health check by an exotic pet vet, including a fecal screening to look for intestinal parasites.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Cavies are accustomed to occasional sprinting and leaping in the wild, in addition to roaming and grazing each day. This means that they need space to move in captivity, including running and jumping. Even large enclosures might not fulfill these animals' need for exercise, so acclimate your cavy to wearing a properly fitted harness and leash early in life so that you can take your pet walking or hiking with you.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Cavies are good at grooming themselves with their tongues, much like cats, so there is no need to bathe or brush your pet.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Cavies grow to be about the size of a small dog, such as a Welsh corgi.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>Cavies are not as well-behaved or as easily trainable as dogs, but some owners report success with clicker training used for dogs and acclimating their cavies to walking on a leash. Like cats, you might be able to train your cavy to use a litter box just make sure it's a metal box because your cavy will chew it.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Patagonian Cavy as a Pet </h2><p>If you can provide appropriate care and housing for a Patagonian cavy, then you may find it to be a fun and rewarding pet to own. Despite their instinctive drive to dig, they can be cuddly and even learn to walk on a leash. Cavies do require a great deal of attention, though, and a very secure enclosure where they can be left when you're not supervising them.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Patagonian Cavy </h2><p>Patagonian cavies cost $200 to $300. Purchase your cavy from a certified breeder. If you need help locating one, speak to an exotics vet who might know someone in their network. Most cavies are sold as babies and will need to be bottle-raised from the start. Reputable breeders should be able to provide you with documentation, information on the animal's parents, and thorough care instructions.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Patagonian Cavy </h2> <p>If you raise a cavy from a baby or adopt a well-socialized adult it's likely that your pet will enjoy being touched and snuggled. Some cavies even love having their furry bellies rubbed.</p><p>Cavies that are raised with gentle cats and dogs can become friends with these domestic pets, but they should never be left unattended with other animals since they can be skittish and may attract predatory behavior from dogs (or even cats) with their quick movements.</p><p>You can occasionally give small amounts of fruit to a cavy, but since fruit is not a natural part of their diet, their digestion can be upset by too much of this sweet food.</p>",1415
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/big-cats-as-pets-1236722,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Big Cat as a Pet? </h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Big Cat as a Pet? </h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>While there are 30 cat species in the world, the term ""big cat"" refers to seven specific species: tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, snow leopard, cheetah, and cougar. These large and powerful cats are awe-inspiring, and people are often intrigued by the idea of keeping one as a pet. But what kind of pets do tigers, lions, and other big cats make and is it even legal to keep these animals in captivity?</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Tiger, lion, jaguar, leopard, snow leopard, cheetah, and cougar</p> <p>SCIENTIFIC NAMES: , , , , , , and</p> <p>ADULT SIZES: From 5 to 10 feet in length, and 49 to 660 pounds</p> <p>LIFESPAN: Up to 20 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Big Cat as a Pet? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>The Captive Wildlife Safety Act was introduced and passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004 to address the problems of the availability of wild cats as pets. This law prohibits interstate and foreign trade in exotic cats, including lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars, and cougars for the pet trade.</p><p>Circuses, zoos, wildlife rehabilitators, and some other licensed facilities are exempt from the Captive Wildlife Safety Act. This legislation was introduced with the sole purpose of making big cats unavailable to the private citizen pet trade, although it is not an outright ban on ownership.</p><p>Experts estimate that there are thousands of tigers kept as pets in private facilities in the U.S., possibly outnumbering the tigers left in the wild. The numbers compiled by the Feline Conservation Federation show a drop in ownership of big cats in the U.S. in the period from 2011 to 2016.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Pet tigers have been involved in several fatalities and maulings in the U.S. and Canada in recent years, which generally results in the animals' destruction as well. Sadly, pet tigers and other big cats end up neglected, abused, or given up to sanctuaries when their owners cannot care for them. These tragic situations can be easily avoided by not choosing wild cats like tigers for pets.</p><p>While there are owners of big cats who go out of their way to provide appropriate housing and diet and have no problems, there are countless others who are misguided in their expectations and ability to provide the proper care.</p><h2>Things to Consider </h2><p>Owning a big cat of any species is a huge undertaking that should be carefully considered before making the decision to purchase one. Even if you can find a legal loophole that allows ownership, big cats can be extremely dangerous to people as well as other pets, and they can cause serious property damage if housed improperly. These animals need large, secure enclosures with structures for a cat to climb. In addition, big cats live long lives in captivity (up to 20 years), making conscientious ownership a long-term commitment with heavy financial and legal responsibility.</p><h2>Big Cat Behavior & Temperament </h2><p>The smaller of the non-domestic cats, such as bobcats, servals, and lynx, may look like house cats, but they are not at all like domestic cats. Different species have different temperaments, but all of these cats can exhibit destructive behavior from urine marking to dangerous aggression.</p><p>The big cats are even more problematic. Even if a particular individual is not typically aggressive, its natural tendencies must be remembered. Wild cats are predators; even at play, they exhibit instinctive predatory behavior such as pouncing, wrestling, biting, and clawing. Their huge size and strengthmakethem a serious threat at all times.</p><p>All wild cats have sharp claws and teeth, so they can be quite dangerous. Even trained zookeepers who work with these animals everyday risk being attacked if the animal is startled or provoked in some way.</p><h2>Housing Big Cats </h2><p>Big cats need a lot of outdoor space in order to thrive. In captivity, they require large enclosures that have extremely high walls or caged-in ceilings. It is a huge commitment and responsibility to properly care for even the smaller wild cats. Their enclosures must also be extremely secure because there's a very real danger of a big cat escaping and attacking people or other pets.</p><p>Big cats require plenty of intellectual and physical enrichment opportunities, much as they would experience in the wild. These are smart, inquisitive animals that will get bored if they are under-stimulated, and boredom may lead to depression and health problems.</p><h3>Stinky Spraying </h3><p>Big cats naturally have a musky odor, and they tend to spray their urine. Spraying is instinctive ""marking"" behavior, so it is not possible to train these animals to stop. The odor of cat urine and excrement will quickly ruin a house and your property value, so aside from danger and cruelty to the animal, keeping a big cat indoors is simply a bad financial decision.</p><h3>Expenses to Expect </h3><p>Big Cat Rescue estimates an investment of $25,000 in the first year of owning a small to midsize wildcat and annual costs of $7,500. For big cats, expect over $100,000 for the first year and ongoing annual costs of over $10,000.</p><h2>What Do Big Cats Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Big cats are carnivores and require a lot of raw meat. Some species can eat up to 15 pounds of meat per day. They also need vitamins and supplements to mimic the nutrients they acquire in the wild to stay healthy. In their native habitats, big cats hunt animals like deer, fish, gazelles, birds, reptiles, and numerous small mammals. They eat the meat of their prey as well as skin, bones, and organs that provide multifaceted nutrients.</p><p>Since the average lifespan of a big cat is around 20 years, feeding one on a daily basis represents a significant financial burden.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Much like the common house cat, big cats are prone to feline diseases like distemper and rabies. Most zoos immunize their lions, tigers, and other cats against these conditions. As a private owner, though, it may be a challenge to find a veterinarian who can-or will-provide the proper vaccines for a wild animal.</p><p>There are several other ailments that affect big cats as well. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a feline equivalent to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). If not treated, FIV can weaken the cat's immune system and make it vulnerable to other contagious diseases.</p><p>The feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is another potentially fatal disease that can affect both house cats and big cats. It can be treated if caught early, but it often leads to other illnesses in cats, including anemia, chronic infections, and cancers. If FeLV develops into full-blown cancer it is almost always fatal.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>All species of big cats require a great deal of exercise. They roam territories that may span hundreds of miles in the wild, plus they leap, climb, and pounce to catch prey. These behaviors can be hard to accommodate in captivity. The ideal big cat enclosure would include a large amount of open space as well as structures to climb in order to challenge your cat physically and keep it in optimal health.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Big cats naturally groom themselves thoroughly, so they do not need to be bathed or brushed by humans. They use their rough tongues to clean and ""comb"" their fur, removing dirt and debris. Some big cats, like tigers, enjoy access to pools of fresh water, but this is mainly for body temperature regulation, not cleanliness.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>There are seven species of felines classified as big cats in the world, yet ""big"" has a wide range of meaning. The smallest big cat is the endangered snow leopard , which measures five to about nine feet long and weighs between 49 and 121 pounds. On the other end of the spectrum, the largest big cat is the endangered Siberian or Amur tiger , which can measure up to ten feet from head to tail and can weigh up to 660 pounds.</p>",1294
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/madagascar-hissing-cockroach-1236891,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Should You Keep a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Have you ever considered keeping a cockroach as a pet? Madagascar hissing cockroaches, otherwise known as ""hissers,"" are a dark reddish-brown to black color with a hard exoskeleton. Unlike most cockroaches, they have no wings for flight or jumping.The hissing cockroaches make pretty fascinating pets, and they don't even mind humans petting their brittle exoskeleton. The easygoing nature of the Madagascar hissing cockroach makes it a good starter pet for owners who are new to insect keeping. Despite its fearsome name, the Madagascar hissingcockroaches are described by their human fans as hardy, docile, and easy tohandle. Their housing needs are simple just a warm, secure tank with wood shavings and a few hiding places. Plus, they aren't very picky eaters.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Madagascar hissing cockroach</p> <p>Adult Size: Up to 3 inches in length</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 5 years</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Madagascar Hissing Cockroach</h3><h2>Can You Own a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Some U.S. states, including Florida, require individuals or institutions who want to keep Madagascar hissing cockroaches to have a special permit, whether for captive breeding colonies or even one lone roach. Permits specify and advise keepers not to ever take the females, especially pregnant females, out of their enclosed habitats. This is required to prevent the inadvertent introduction of an invasive species into U.S. environments.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>It is legal to own Madagascar hissing cockroaches in the U.S., providing you follow your state's regulations for doing so. Therefore, unlike a number of other exotic pets, legality is not an ethical issue when deciding to keep hissing roaches as pets.</p><p>Just remember that keeping males and females in the same enclosure will result in breeding and lots of little roaches. If your goal is to establish a breeding colony, be sure you're prepared to deal with all the offspring with a dependable source of buyers or adopters established before breeding. Releasing baby hissing cockroaches into the wild is highly unethical because they are not native to the United States and do not fare well in the U.S. climate without human care.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>According to the Entomology Department at the University of Kentucky, Madagascar hissing cockroaches are the best arthropods to keep in captivity because they can thrive in a domestic environment if properly care for. Plus, they are not dangerous to humans or other pets in a household.</p><h2>Madagascar Hissing Cockroach Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Despite their creepy reputation, cockroaches are mild-mannered forest dwellers that don't mean any harm to humans. Madagascar hissing cockroaches are larger and hardier than the common kitchen-raiding variety we think of in the U.S., so they are easier to handle and don't mind human contact. They will tolerate holding, petting, and gentle examining by curious owners. These roaches do not bite or scratch, even though their little feet might feel slightly sharp to the skin.</p><p>In their enclosure, they will crawl around and explore, eat food they find, and seek dark hiding places when they need a rest.</p><p>One of the most interesting things about these roaches is that they make an audible hissing sound.</p><h3>The Hissing Sound </h3><p>Hissing cockroaches have a pair of modified spiracles; these are the tubes insects use for breathing. These insects use these spiracles to produce the hissing sound that inspired their name. They will hiss when disturbed, and males also hiss when courting females. Sometimes a whole colony will hiss in unison for reasons that are as yet unclear to researchers.</p><p>Hissers force air through the spiracles to produce all of their various hissing sounds; one call is used to attract a mate, another is used when the cockroach is feeling threatened (known as the ""disturbance"" hiss), and a third known hiss is a warning, used when a male cockroach is preparing to attack another male.</p><p>Adult male roaches can be identified by their two large protruding bumps (tubercles) on their dorsal plate (prothorax) behind the head. Adult females also have tubercles in the same location but they are smooth.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>The Madagascar hissing cockroachnative to the large island of Madagascar off the east coast of Southern Africa, is one of the world's largest cockroach species. In their wild habitat, these wood dwellers are commonly found living in fallen and decaying trees or dry leaf litter.</p><p>In captivity, a 5 to 10-gallon fish tank will house several Madagascar hissing cockroaches comfortably. Use a secure mesh lid to keep the roaches secure while allowing plenty of air circulation. Also, make sure your determined climbers can't get out by applying a thick coating of petroleum jelly to the top few inches of the glass walls inside the habitat.</p><p>It is important to make sure your enclosure is secure; while they're not known as escape artists, a Madagascar hissing cockroach that finds its way out of its tank can be killed by a fall from a tabletop (or by an unsuspecting human who steps on an escapee).</p><p>Being tropical creatures, hissing cockroaches are most at home when they'rekept at just above room temperature; they tolerate temperatures of 75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Aspen wood shavings, 1 to 2 inches deep, are a suitable substrate for the hissers; avoid cedar or pine shavings which will make them sick. Because hissers do not like bright light, provide only very subdued ambient lighting, and add some hiding places. They will be happy with hiding places as simple as the cardboard rolls from toilet paper, pieces of cardboard egg cartons, cork bark, driftwood, and small cardboard boxes.</p><h2>What do Hissing Cockroaches Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Feed hissing cockroaches a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, including romaine and other leafy greens (avoid iceberg lettuce) in combination with a pellet food that's high in protein, such as dry dog food. Carrots are reputed to be a favorite, along with oranges, apples, bananas, tomatoes, celery, squash, peas, pea pods, and other colorful vegetables.</p><p>Remove uneaten food after a few days to avoid spoilage. Unlike some other cockroaches, hissers may not eat decaying or rotting food matter. Clean and clear fresh, non-chlorinated water should be provided in a shallow dish that has climbable rocks in it to prevent your pets from drowning.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Madagascar hissing cockroaches are hardy; just like most cockroaches, they don't have many health issues. One thing to watch out for, however, is dehydration; if your pet cockroach looks shriveled or wrinkled, it's probably not getting enough water. If it's not showing signs of dehydration and it hisses slightly when you first touch it (indicating alertness), then it's likely a healthy cockroach.</p><p>Cockroaches molt (shed their outer exoskeleton) six separate times before reaching maturity. These periods are when your cockroach is at its most vulnerable; it may hide and not eat the day before a molt as it prepares for the shed. This is normal and not a cause for concern. Once it reaches about seven months of age, it stops molting and has reached adulthood.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>A full-grown hissing cockroach is about the length of an average adult's index finger, so it fits nicely in the palm of your hand.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Madagascar Hissing Cockroach as a Pet </h2><p>For people who are interested in insects, a Madagascar hissing cockroach is a great pet. This inexpensive cockroach is impressively large and makes a hissing sound, so it can be a fun learning tool for kids who are budding entomologists. This pet can also be a good pet for parents who want to help their kids get over a fear of creepy-crawly creatures. The hissing cockroach doesn't skitter like other bugs, which is a major fear factor for those with entomophobia (fear of insects).</p><p>Just make sure to check with your state to make sure you have the proper permit for owning this exotic pet.</p><h2>Purchasing </h2><p>These aren't your standard kitchen-invading cockroaches. You must buy them from a reputable insect breeder; they are low-cost pets to purchase, usually under 5 dollars each. If you want to set up your own breeding colony, purchase at least 10 individuals; request four adult females for every one adult male. This will increase the chances that your breeding colony will provide large numbers of roaches for many years to come.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Madagascar Hissing Cockroach </h2> <p>Hissing cockroaches are easy to care for. They don't take up much space, have simple food requirements, and don't mind being handled occasionally.</p><p>These roaches hiss when they are agitated, but they do not bite and are not harmful to humans.</p><p>Hissing cockroaches can live up to five years in captivity.</p>",1416

These quick, agile creatures are solitary by nature, so they neither need nor want human companionship. A genet requires a large, secure enclosure that contains trees or other climbing structures. Because they are nocturnal in the wild, captive genets tend to be active at night and sleep during the day, making them less entertaining than a diurnal pet. In addition, finding a veterinarian who can care for a genet can be difficult since these animals are so rarely kept as pets.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name:Genet</p><p>Scientific Name: g</p><p>Adult Size:32 to 43 inches from head to tail, and about 4 pounds</p><p>Lifespan:13 to 20 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Genet? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Many exotic pets are banned in the U.S. Most states consider genets wildlife, which means that owning them is either illegal or requires a special permit. Confirm with your state's Department of Agriculture andalsocheck with your county, neighborhood association, and any other relevant jurisdictions. As of 2019, only a few states identify genets by name in terms of legality. If not specified, genets fall under the generic label of ""wildlife"" and are regulated as such.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Because genets are wild animals that are not well suited to life in captivity, keeping one locked in an enclosure is not considered ethical. Genets do not bond well with humans and are not friendly or cuddly, so they do not offer those benefits that domesticated pets do. Keeping a genet for entertainment or to impress others is simply unkind to the animal. Many people who seek exotic pets for the wrong reasons are also not able or willing to invest the time and money it takes to create a suitable habitat for wild animals.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>If you are looking for a soft, cuddly pet that will be your companion, a genet is not the right animal for you. Often shy and aloof, they are solitary creatures in the wild and have little interest in interacting with humans, much less snuggling or going for walks.</p><h2>Genet Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Genets are not hands-on pets. They are usually aloof and independent. You may think they look like larger ferrets which are cuddly and fun, but genets usually resist restraint and handling.</p><p>Genets have retractable claws, very long tails, and are agile, squirrel-like climbers. If it feels comfortable with you, your genet may decide to climb on you, much like a tree. However, they do not have the restraint necessary for keeping their claws from digging into you. Some genet owners consider the controversial practice of declawing, which most agree is unethical because it renders the animal unable to engage in its natural climbing behavior.</p><p>If not socialized from a young age and handled frequently, they may be extremely skittish and wary of people-even their owners. Some scurry and hide at the sound of loud noises. They are also nocturnal creatures, meaning they don't like to be awake during the day.</p><p>Genets do not do well in groups of any kind but usually tolerate dogs and cats if they have grown up with them. Genets perceive smaller pets, like mice and hamsters, as prey items. Their presence in the same room with small rodents will likely stress out the smaller pets.</p><p>It is best if there are no other pets in the house at all. This exclusive attention increases the chance of your genet bonding with you.</p><p>Genets also tend to mark their territory. When you get your genet spayed or neutered, you can have their scent glands removed by an experienced exotics vet (similar to skunk and ferret gland removal). They will mark their cages routinely and become stressed if you try to clean all the places they marked at one time.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Your genet should have a large, secure enclosure at least 4 by 8 feet with a height of 6 feet. A gigantic ferret cage is your best option because it already comes with levels to climb on and small bar spacing so the animals can't escape. If a genet can fit its head through something, it can get its whole body out, too.</p><p>The pet should only be caged when you are not around. Otherwise, it will need at least three hours of supervised playtime outside of the cage daily.</p><p>Being agile jumpers and climbers, they will often jump to high platforms to look around. They need space to run and jump safely.</p><h3>Specific Substrate </h3><p>Most genets are litter box trained. You can provide a small cat litter box with recycled newspaper litter or unscented cat litter in the cage. If properly trained, your genet should return to its cage to use its litter box when free in the house.</p><h2>What Do Genets Eat and Drink? </h2><p>As an opportunistic feeder, the genet will eat anything it can get its paws on. Genets have similar dietary requirements to felines, including protein with high amounts of the amino acid taurine and lower amounts of carbohydrates.</p><p>In the wild, small rodents, reptiles, amphibians, and insects are all prey to the genet. In captivity, offer a mixture of grain-free ferret food and high-quality commercial food cat food with human-grade ingredients. Feed amounts according to the packaging instructions and the weight of your pet. You can also give fruit, insects, and cooked chicken. A genet may enjoy chicken bones to crunch on, but bones should not be cooked to avoid splintering. Provide fresh water daily in a heavy cat bowl.</p><p>Genets often tend to be food aggressive. Feed your pet in its cage to avoid an accidental bite from an animal that feels threatened while eating.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Genets are so rare as pets that it can be difficult to find exotic pet veterinarians with the expertise to care for them. There are no approved vaccines for genets, but exotics vets recommend annual check-ups. Some genet owners and their vets opt to vaccinate with rabies and distemper vaccines, but the efficacy and safety of this practice are still up for debate. Spaying and neutering (and de-scenting if chosen) should be done at a young age (by 6 months) or as your vet recommends.</p><p>This pet is prone to behavioral problems if it is re-homed. This creature usually bonds with its original owner from a young age; if abandoned or surrendered, the psychological stress from being separated from its bonded owner is likely to make it distrusting of humans for the rest of its life.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Genets are longer than house cats, mostly due to their long tails. They measure from 32 to 43 inches from their noses to the tips of their tails as adults. They weigh up to about 4 pounds (males are generally a bit larger than females), which is about half as much as the average-sized cat.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Genet as a Pet </h2><p>While genets can be interesting and beautiful pets, they are not for the average pet enthusiast. A genet must be acquired and regularly socialized as a baby to create a pet-owner bond that will yield a rewarding relationship. Genets are intelligent and active (mostly at night) and need sufficient room to explore, move, and climb. Not everyone can offer the habitat and attention required to keep a genet humanely, but some owners do manage to establish a happy home for their wild pets.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Genet </h2><p>Theprice for genets can exceed $1,500 for both the purchase and shipment of the animal. Try to obtain yourgenetfrom a reputable breeder (a challenge because they are so rare). Try to get a baby or young genet; older ones will be more difficult to handle and bond with. An exotic pet broker is another potential source for finding one. Seek a seller who proactively gives you a lot of information about the animal and asks a lot of questions about you and your suitability to care for a genet.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Genet </h2> <p>Genets can be kept inside as long as they have a large cage in which they can be kept at night. They will also climb all over your house, trying to get up as high as possible, so make sure your house and furniture are up to the challenge-and the claws.</p><p>In the wild, genets are solitary creatures, so they do not enjoy company much. A persistently curious or aggressive dog or cat may make a genet feel frightened and stressed.</p><p>Genets are native to northern regions of Africa, the Mediterranean islands, and the Middle East.</p>",1427
48,https://www.thesprucepets.com/northern-flying-squirrels-1239502,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Northern Flying Squirrel as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Northern Flying Squirrel as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Northern flying squirrels are small nocturnal rodents that live in the forest canopy. They glide from tree to tree by spreading their arms and legs apart. The kite-like skin folds between their front and back legs, calledpatagia, catch air, so they appear to be flying. Northern flying squirrels require hands-on attention and socializing with their owners. They also need spacious cages and, like many other rodents, they need hard things to chew on to keep their teeth trimmed and healthy. Flying squirrels have fun personalities and can be great pets, but they do require a fair amount of supervision. As such, they are not ideal pets for young children.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Northern flying squirrel</p> <p>Adult Size: 8 to 10 inches long (head to tail), and up to 4 ounces</p><p>Lifespan: 10 to 15 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Northern Flying Squirrel? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Before bringing home a northern flying squirrel, make sure it's legal to keep them as pets where you live. Some areas may place restrictions on owning these wild species as pets. Legal acquisition of a pet flying squirrel is typically obtained only through a breeder and then by securing the proper state permits; this varies by state.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Owning a wild animal as a pet is a subject full of ethical controversy. It can be argued that wild animals are the happiest and healthiest in their native habitats, but conscientious owners can offer environments and care that keep their exotic pets in top condition. People who feel that keeping a wild creature behind bars for most of its life is acceptable rarely encounter ethical quandaries about owning an exotic pet.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Before bringing home a flying squirrel, consider all of its needs and decide whether or not you can fulfill them. Keeping a squirrel too confined or without adequately nutritious food is not only cruel but also prevents your pet from being as interactive and enjoyable as it can be.</p><h2>Northern Flying Squirrel Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Northern flying squirrels are native to North America and are extremely wary of people in the wild. It would be difficult if not impossible to capture and completely tame a flying squirrel that was not raised by humans. Fortunately, captively bred flying squirrels are much more eager to bond with people, and they can be quite friendly with those they trust.</p><p>The process of bonding with a pet squirrel can be fun. You need to wear a fabric pouch around yourneck, tucked inside your shirt. Keeping the new squirrel inside this pouch allows the squirrel to learn to recognize your scent. With sufficient handling at a young age, northern flying squirrels can be very affectionate and will enjoy being snuggled and carried. Your pet squirrel may even enjoy riding on your shoulders.</p><p>Northern flying squirrels are quiet animals, but they may scramble around their enclosure at night (since they are naturally nocturnal). If you want a sound night's sleep, it's best to keep your squirrel's enclosure out of your bedroom.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Whatever enclosure is chosen for your flying squirrel, it must have very small spaces between the bars or mesh to prevent escapes or accidental injury, especially if you have a baby flying squirrel. Squirrels that have bonded with their owners enjoy being in close contact and will attempt to escape to get closer.</p><p>The vertical height is more important than horizontal space in flying squirrel cages as they enjoy climbing up as high as they can go. Tall bird cages are often used to house flying squirrels. Metal cages are much more difficult for a rodent to chew through, and birdcages are also available with narrow bar spacing.</p><p>Be sure to provide areas in the cage onto which your Northern squirrel can climb; branches are good for this as are ropes made of chemical-free cotton fibers. Also, provide nest boxes where the squirrel can retreat for sleep and soft nesting materials such as strips of unbleached cotton fabric.</p><h2>What Do Northern Flying Squirrels Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Like many rodents, wild flying squirrels are omnivorous; they eat a variety of protein and vegetable foods. Nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetables, mealworms, lichens, fungi, and other treats are routinely eaten by northern flying squirrels. Many flying squirrel owners feed a base diet of a parrot seed mixture which is made up of different sunflower seeds, pellets, pumpkin seeds, and other sources of protein. An assortment of fruits and vegetables in moderation, healthy cereals, and parrot or monkey biscuits can help round out the nutritional requirements of a squirrel.</p><p>Since flying squirrels are prone to calcium deficiency, they need both calcium and vitamin D3 supplements included in their diets. A cuttlebone or calcium block in its enclosure will help to file down the squirrel's continuously growing teeth as well as contribute to its dietary needs. Try to limit foods high in phosphorous in your Northern flying squirrel's diets since phosphorous can interfere with calcium absorption. Prepackaged, formulated diets for flying squirrels can be found online, but these vary widely in their nutritional value.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Northern flying squirrels are generally hardy in captivity. Wild flying squirrels in the U.S., however, are susceptible to typhus, an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans. As long as you purchase a captively bred squirrel from a reputable breeder and do not allow it to come into contact with wild squirrels, this should not be an issue. Look for a veterinarian in your area who specializes in rodent care so that you can ensure your pet remains healthy for the duration of its long life. Finding an exotic pet veterinarian could be tricky, so call local clinics and ask questions before purchasing a flying squirrel.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Flying squirrels are active, energetic animals-but they are naturally nocturnal, so they are active at night. When keeping one as a pet, you should wake your squirrel during the day and take it out of its enclosure to scurry and climb around your house so that it gets enough exercise to stay fit and maintain a healthy weight. Your squirrel is more likely to clamber around its cage at night if it sleeps during the day and does not get enough exercise.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>There is no need to bathe or brush your flying squirrel. These animals groom themselves with their little tongue and paws, so they stay very clean without human help.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Northern flying squirrels are small animals; their bodies can fit in the hand of an adult human. With their tails, they measure about 8 to 10 inches long and weigh up to just 4 ounces.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Owning a Northern Flying Squirrel </h2><p>Northern flying squirrels are fun, curious, and energetic; they bond closely to humans they've grown up with. These characteristics make them fun pets, but the fact that they are nocturnal makes them less than ideal companions for the average person. They want to be awake and active during the hours when most people sleep.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Northern Flying Squirrel </h2><p>There are several flying squirrel breeders around the U.S. such as Janda Exotics in Texas which specializes in selling tame, healthy squirrel babies. Most breeders will not ship their squirrels, though, so you will need to consider traveling to pick up your new baby.</p><p>Most flying squirrels that are purchased from a breeder are sent home with their new owners while they are still babies. You will then bottle-feed your baby squirrel for a few weeks to encourage bonding with you. Make sure you have everything your new squirrel will need before bringing it home so that you can provide the care it needs.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Northern Flying Squirrel </h2> <p>Flying squirrels are nocturnal and instinctively sleep in their nests during the day. You'll have to wake your squirrel in order to interact and provide playtime.</p><p>The biggest challenge of owning one of these animals is keeping them safely confined when you are not tending to them. Their enclosure should be well ventilated but with small enough spaces that the squirrel can't get its head caught and suffer injury or death.</p><p>It's not a good idea to keep squirrels around cats, dogs, or even ferrets because these animals have the instinct to kill squirrels for food. Your squirrel will not be safe around these animals.</p>",1384

While there is some variation in the appearance of the giant millipede species, they are largely similar in their behavior and care. Giant millipedes need a secure aquarium tank with a warm light source and regulated humidity. They eat easy-to-find vegetables, and they generally don't mind being handled. Just make sure to wash your hands after handling a millipede because it can emit a toxic substance from its body when alarmed.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Giant millipede, African giant millipede</p> <p>Adult Size: up to 13 inches long</p><p>Lifespan: 5 to 10 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Giant Millipede? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>It is perfectly legal to own a giant millipede as a pet in the U.S., but it is not legal to import wild-caught specimens across the U.S. border.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Because it is easy to provide proper housing and care for giant millipedes, there is very little ethical controversy about owning them.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Giant millipedes are fun pets for people who enjoy ""creepy-crawly"" creatures and those seeking to overcome their fears of them. Giant millipedes are calm and tolerant of handling, plus they have pretty simple habitat and food needs, so they make great exotic pets.</p><h2>Giant Millipede Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Giant millipedes can be handled safely; they are quite docile and slow-moving. They get along fine with others, so you can keep more than one in the same tank. These millipedes do breed quite readily, though, so if you have males and females together you may discover babies-lots of them. Male millipedes have modified legs on the seventh body segment called gonopods. These legs look different than the other legs in that they have grasping claws and are often carried tucked up under the body.</p><p>While they are generally easy-going, these arthropods can get frightened occasionally. When that happens, they have two main modes of defense: First, they curl into a tight spiral; next, they secrete an irritating liquid from body pores.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>From each body segment, a millipede can secrete a yellow-brown fluid; it is called a repugnatorial fluid because it smells and tastes foul to predators. Made of hydrogen cyanide, the fluid will irritate your eyes and mouth, so always wash your hands after handling a millipede. Some people are more sensitive to the liquid than others, and some species are also more toxic than others.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Giant millipedes do very well in captivity as long as they're kept in an environment that suits their needs. As a general rule, a 10 to 15-gallon aquarium provides ample room for a couple of millipedes. Floor space is more important than height. A tight-fitting lid is a good idea to prevent the millipedes from sneaking out; just make sure the lid is ventilated with holes small enough to let air in and keep the millipedes from escaping.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Millipedes like to burrow a bit, so a 3 to 4inch layer of peat moss or a peat moss/soil mixture (no chemical or fertilizer added) can form the base. This can be covered with some sphagnum moss and pieces of bark to provide additional cover. Leaf litter can also be used, although you may want to freeze it first to kill any insects that may be in it.</p><h3>Specific Heat and Humidity Needs </h3><p>There are varied opinions on the appropriate temperatures for giant millipedes. Since millipedes are native to tropical climates, many keepers recommend that the tank should be kept at about 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit or even as high as 85 Fahrenheit. To achieve these conditions, you can use an under-tank heater on a thermostat (often sold for reptile keeping) placed under only one-half of the tank.</p><p>If placing a heater under the tank warms the substrate too much or dries it out, the heat pad can be affixed to the side or back of the tank. On the other hand, many keepers do not provide supplemental heat at all. If this is the case, make sure your room temperature during the day is at least 72 Fahrenheit, although a slight drop at night should be tolerable. The humidity level in the tank should always be kept at 75 to 80 percent. This can be achieved by keeping the substrate damp with regular misting and checking with a relative humidity meter.</p><h2>What Do Giant Millipedes Eat and Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, giant millipedes are herbivores that graze on old and decaying (but not rotting) plant material. In captivity, they can be fed a variety of vegetables and fruits cut into small pieces. Softer vegetables and fruits are best try lettuce, cucumber (reported to be a favorite food of millipedes), tomatoes, melon, peaches, and bananas. Never wash food for millipedes in chlorinated town or city tap water, as all invertebrates are particularly sensitive to chlorine toxicity.</p><p>Additionally, keep a shallow dish of clean and fresh chlorine-free water available for your millipedes all the time. Always leave a large stone in the dish as a climb-out ladder to prevent potential drowning.</p><p>Provide food once a day, about as much as your pet will consume in that amount of time (this may take a little experimentation and observation). Foods can be fed in a shallow dish or jar lid. They prefer food that is starting to decay so leaving remainders in the tank for a day or so is helpful. Occasionally, you can dust some of their food lightly with a vitamin supplement containing calcium to add it to their diet.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Even experienced exotic animal veterinarians often have little experience with invertebrate pets. The professionals available to you may not be able to provide care for an African giant millipede, so pet owners must take responsibility for their millipede's health through careful control of food, water, humidity, and housing. Be sure to test the water for traces of chlorine and chloramine (disinfectants used to treat drinking water) using an inexpensive pool chemistry test kit, and always double-check the quality and cleanliness of the food and substrate you are providing.</p><p>African giant millipedes can struggle with a few health issues, most commonly mites. This can easily become an issue if you've sourced your pet from an unreliable breeder. While some mites live on the millipede and help them keep their body clean (and don't pose any health risks), others attach themselves to one location (typically around the head) and stay there like a parasite. They should be removed with tweezers as quickly and gently as possible.</p><p>Your millipede may also encounter fungal infections, which can be caused by a tank environment that is either too high or too low in humidity. Unfortunately, the presence of fungus often indicates a millipede that is already in poor or declining health and can often be fatal.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Giant millipedes are much bigger than the common centipedes and millipedes we see in the U.S. When fully grown, they can be up to 13 inches long and about as big around as a golf ball.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Giant Millipede as a Pet </h2><p>Giant millipedes are relatively easy to care for in comparison to many other exotic pets. They don't take up much space, and they don't make noise. However, they are not particularly cuddly, if that's a quality you're looking for, and handling them may result in getting an irritating substance on your skin that millipedes emit when they are agitated.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Giant Millipede </h2><p>Giant millipedes must be purchased from an American breeder or pet shop which raises them in the U.S. It is illegal to purchase and transport these animals into the U.S. from other countries. Be sure the seller is a legitimate, licensed breeder with positive reviews from past buyers.</p><h2>SimilarPets to the Giant Millipede </h2> <p>No in fact, they're considered among the easiest invertebrates to care for. As long as you maintain the proper environment for them, caring for the millipede should be very easy.</p><p>While their lifespan is between 5 and 7 years in the wild, giant millipedes that are kept as pets can live up to 10 years with proper care.</p><p>No this specific variety of millipedes is only black, with some dark brown coloration. However, there are other species such as the Ghana chocolate millipede that are lighter in color.</p>",1395
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-chilean-rose-tarantulas-1237348,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chilean Rose Tarantula</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chilean Rose Tarantula</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Chilean rose tarantulas are a popular pet tarantula species to keep. These spiders have bodies that range from black to brown with hairs in red and orange hues. They generally have a docile demeanor, aren't typically prone to biting, and move rather slowly. This makes them ideal for first-time tarantula keepers. They're also relatively easy to care for, requiring regular feedings and housing that mimics their natural environment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Chilean rose tarantula, rose hair tarantula,Chilean fire tarantula</p> <p>Adult Size: Leg span of 4.5 to 5.5 inches</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years (females), 2 to 5 years (males)</p><h2>Chilean Rose Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Chilean rose tarantulas are generally quiet and calm animals. Many can be comfortable with gentle handling, and they don't often bite. However, like other tarantulas, their bite is venomous. Plus, they possess what are called urticating hairs that they can flick off their abdomens toward perceived threats. These hairs can cause skin irritation and be very damaging if they get in your eyes. So this is why it's important to wash your hands immediately after coming in contact with your tarantula or anything in its environment.</p><p>Moreover, these spiders are solitary animals that don't need any companions in their tanks. And they should be kept away from other household pets, as well as people who don't understand how to safely handle them, to avoid stress and injury.</p><p>In spite of their defense mechanisms, these animals still are fairly easy to care for. They're a good choice if you want a pet that doesn't require a lot of space or attention. Plan to spend a few hours per week on feedings and habitat maintenance, and then just enjoy watching this interesting animal.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>The venom in tarantula bites generally will cause a reaction similar to a bee sting in most people. However, some people might be allergic to the venom and have more serious reactions that require prompt medical attention.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Chilean rose tarantulas have a leg span that stretches around 5 inches. Their bodies are about 3 inches long, with the females being slightly bigger than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Chilean rose tarantulas don't need a lot of space. A 5- to 10-gallon tank or terrarium is usually suitable. As a general rule, the width of the enclosure should be roughly two to three times the spider's leg span, the length should be three times its leg span, and the height should be about a foot. The lid should be secure and have ventilation. A side opening is ideal, as it will allow you to access the enclosure even if your spider is hanging upside down from the top.</p><p>Your spider's environment should include a hiding space made from a hollow log, a piece of clean driftwood, or a comparable accessory found in pet stores. Cork bark or half of a small clay flower pot can also be used for a shelter. Artificial plants (or live ones) can provide good additional coverage and a more natural feel to the environment.</p><p>Being desert dwellers, Chilean rose tarantulas are hardy and not very sensitive to heat fluctuations; warm desert days and cold desert nights are the norms in their wild habitat. Usually, any temperature that makes you comfortable will also suit your tarantula. Additionally, Chilean rose tarantulas don't need high humidity; a level around 65% is suitable.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The substrate that lines your spider's tank will allow it to burrow and will lessen the harshness of the smooth glass or plastic floor. Add 2 to 3 inches of peat moss, chemical-free soil, vermiculite, or shredded coconut husk. Change the substrate every four to six months.</p><h2>What Do Chilean Rose Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>As their primary food source, Chilean rose tarantulas favor live crickets and other insects that are smaller than the spider's abdomen. Crickets should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious foods), so that nutrition is passed on to the spider. Some owners also feed the occasional pinkie mouse to adult tarantulas.</p><p>In general, adult tarantulas usually eat only once or twice a week, whereas immature spiders can be fed more often. Consult your vet for the proper quantity and timing for feedings, as this can vary based on the individual spider. To feed, simply drop the live prey in near your spider. It's best to do this in the evening, as this is often when the tarantulas naturally are awake and ready to hunt. Remove unwanted food after 24 hours, or the live prey can begin to stress your spider.</p><p>Furthermore, always keep a shallow dish of fresh water in your spider's enclosure, and refresh it daily. Make sure the spider can easily get in and out of the dish.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>As long as they are kept in the proper environment, Chilean rose tarantulas are typically hardy animals with minimal health problems. What some beginner owners often mistake as a health problem is actually the spider's natural molting process.</p><p>All tarantulas go through periods of molting shedding their old exoskeleton and replacing it with a new one. This is often a stressful time. Your spider might lose its appetite and remain very still. Some even lie on their back with their legs curled, appearing as though they're dead. Don't feed live prey during this time, as it can damage the fragile new exoskeleton. Likewise, avoid handling your spider for a few weeks until the new exoskeleton has hardened. If the molt seems abnormal or is taking a long time, contact a veterinarian.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not every veterinarian has experience with exotic pets like tarantulas. So before you bring home a Chilean rose tarantula, make sure you have a vet near you who can treat it.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like all animals, Chilean rose tarantulas need physical activity to keep them fit and in good body condition. But they don't need an excessive amount of exercise. As long as you provide a sufficiently sized enclosure, they should get the movement they need.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Tarantulas essentially groom themselves via their natural molting process, and they typically don't require help from you. Just make sure their tank remains at the proper temperature and humidity during this time, and don't disturb them with handling.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your Chilean rose tarantula's diet will be your primary upkeep cost. Expect to spend around $5 to $10 per month on average. You can even cut your costs by raising crickets yourself rather than purchasing them from a pet shop. Then, periodic substrate changes and replacing other worn items in the tank can average around $10 to $20. Also, don't forget to budget for veterinary care and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Chilean Rose Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Chilean rose tarantulas make for excellent pets if you're just getting into keeping spiders. They're generally docile and don't tend to bite. And they are fairly low-maintenance and quiet pets. However, if you're hoping for an active pet that provides lots of excitement, this probably isn't the right animal for you. And even though they are typically good-natured, these spiders still possess potentially harmful defense mechanisms.</p><h2>Similar Spiders to the Chilean Rose Tarantula </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out these other invertebrates that can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Chilean Rose Tarantula </h2><p>Thanks to the popularity of this species, many pet stores do carry Chilean rose tarantulas. However, you're often better off going to a reputable breeder or rescue organization. These reputable sellers should be able to give you better information on the animal's history and health. Expect to pay between $20 and $60 on average, though this can vary based on factors such as the animal's age. Also, females typically cost more because they live longer.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Check with local exotic animal veterinarians for information on quality sellers. The main benefit of going to a breeder is you'll likely have a larger selection of young animals. When choosing your tarantula, look for one that appears to be in good body condition and is alert. Ask to see it eat if possible, as appetite is often correlated with health. Finally, to avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, keep multiple spiders housed individually.</p><p>These tarantulas can be good pets for children who understand their handling limitations and are comfortable with feeding live prey.</p><p>Chilean rose tarantulas are relatively low-maintenance pets that require regular feedings and periodic tank cleanings.</p><p>Some Chilean rose tarantulas are comfortable with gentle handling; however, they will never be truly tame pets.</p><p>Tarantulas: Terrible or Terrific!</p><p>Tarantula Spider Bite Information..</p><p>When Your Pet Has Eight Legs.</p>",1403

Armadillos are not domesticated pets like cuddly ferrets or puppies; they are wild animals that can be challenging to care for in captivity as they need space to roam and dig, and are active at night.</p><p>The most commonly seen type of pet armadillo is the three-banded armadillo, which includes both the Brazilian and southern types. Native to South America, it is the only species of armadillo that can roll into the classic ball that you picture when you think about the animal.</p><p>The screaming hairy armadillo is the name for another armadillo kept as a pet, but it is less popular than the three-banded variety. Its name comes from the noise this armadillo makes when handled or threatened, and it also goes by several names, including the screaming armadillo, the dwarf screaming armadillo (due to its small size), the crying armadillo, and the small hairy armadillo. The last type of armadillo that you might happen upon as a pet is the big hairy armadillo, which is the largest of the three pet species.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Armadillo, three-banded armadillo, Southern three-banded armadillo</p> <p>Adult Size: 20 to 42 inches long</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 30 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Armadillo? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>If you do decide that you want an armadillo as a pet, check your local laws first. Armadillos are wild animals, and their status varies from state to state. If your state allows you to own one, and if you're prepared to make your home fit for a burrowing, insect-eating, eight-acre roaming, nocturnal armadillo, be sure to follow all of the local rules for keeping exotic pets.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Like with all pets, it's important to consider whether you can provide a pet armadillo with everything they need to thrive before adopting or purchasing one. Armadillos need a great deal of care and require unique habitats and environments, so it will take a good amount of your time, energy, and resources to care for one properly. Making sure you're aware of (and up to) the commitment of ownership is key to ethically acquiring an armadillo.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Armadillos are nocturnal creatures, so you should make sure you have a spot in your home where they can be allowed to enjoy their nighttime activities undisturbed. If the only option is keeping your armadillo in your bedroom, that might to be a good option for you them.</p><h2>Armadillo Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Armadillos are generally solitary creatures in the wild, they only socialize to mate and to raise their young. Therefore, keeping multiple armadillos together can lead to clashes. They are often active at night and need room to roam; cover eight acres of roaming in their territory when out in the wild. They require deep soil to burrow in, along with insects to forage.</p><p>If raised in a human environment from a young age, pet armadillos can actually be quite affectionate and calm. They can enjoy being petted or sitting on your lap. However, even a tame armadillo raised in captivity from birth can do some damage to you or your flooring material with its sharp claws as it tries to dig for bugs. Additionally, they can walk on their hind legs, using only their front claws to aid them in balancing. While it may seem fun to make your armadillo curl up in a ball, that's actually a defensive posture for the animal and indicates that it's under duress.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Fascinating Armadillo</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>Armadillos cannot be comfortably cared for inside a house due to their natural odor which is strong and musky. In warm climates, an armadillo must be kept in a large outdoor enclosure that provides both sun and shade. A small wading pool is a welcome addition as well.</p><p>If you live in a cold climate, you will likely have to bring your pet indoors for the winter. However, since armadillos need space to forage and will usually become destructive inside the home, winter home living with this warm-climate species is a near impossibility unless you have an insulated barn or other spacious enclosure. In general, armadillos need their environment to be consistently above 71 degrees Fahrenheit at all times in order to live comfortably.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Armadillos enjoy burrowing in the soft ground. If you're not keeping your pet somewhere where this is naturally available to them, make sure you provide large mounds of mulch or mulch mixed with wood chips in which they can burrow.</p><h2>What Do Armadillos Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Much like their cousins the sloths and anteaters, armadillos eat insects and small invertebrates like earthworms. If given the chance, armadillos will also eat fruit, eggs, sweet potatoes, and other small vegetables.If you keep an armadillo in an appropriate enclosure, it will use its strong front digging claws to find much of its own food. Check with your exotic animal veterinarian for specific foods to provide your armadillo. Like any pet, armadillos also need constant access to fresh, clean, and clear, non-chlorinated water.</p><p>Armadillos have a slow metabolism so some people worry that their pets aren't eating enough however, your pet most likely has a normal appetite. They also don't have many teeth, so if they are eating something other than worms and insects, it must be made soft.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Armadillos are one of the few animals known to carry the bacteria that causes leprosy in humans, though cases of bacterial transmission are rare. Little is known about other diseases that are a threat to armadillos, however, they can also transmit rabies.</p><p>Veterinary care is hard to find for these unique animals. Note that armadillos are prone to frostbite due to their slow metabolism. It may be hard even for a veterinarian to spot signs of frostbite on an animal whose outer layering is structured to keep most of its soft tissue hidden.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>If kept in the proper environment, armadillos will fulfill all their exercise needs on their own. Many zoos also provide their armadillos with exercise wheels, which can also be an option for your pet if you have the necessary room.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Armadillos are well-known for their armored plates, which cover the majority of their body. These plates are made of keratin, the same material that your fingernails are made of, and they protect these small mammals from predators by covering their bellies when they curl into themselves.Because of this, armadillos do not need any human grooming, including bathing. However, if you notice the appearance of your armadillo's plates changing in any way (color, peeling, etc.), make sure to let your vet know immediately.</p><h2>Training Your Armadillo </h2><p>While armadillos can be sweet and affectionate, they are not particularly known for their intelligence, and thus are not trainable. The most you can expect is an armadillo that is content with being held and pet, which comes with human exposure from a young age. Beyond that, do not expect your pet armadillos to learn any tricks or retain any training.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Armadillo </h2><p>You will not want to adopt a wild or adult armadillo, as it will be very difficult to care for and train. Expect to pay $2,000 to $3,000 for a bred and hand-tamed, baby armadillo. Make sure you're purchasing your pet through an accredited breeder, and inquire as to whether they have the proper certificates in place that allow for legal resale in your state or town.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Armadillo </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other exotic animals that can be your pet.</p><p>Yes. Armadillos are definitely one of the more difficult exotic pets to care for, primarily due to their need for a housing environment that very nearly mimics the one they would experience in the wild.</p><p>Not really while you can acquire an armadillo that has been bred for pet ownership, at the end of the day these are wild animals and their needs and behavior will largely reflect that.</p><p>Armadillos can live up to 20 years in captivity, and will experience a slightly abbreviated lifespan in the wild (closer to 10 years), thanks to natural predators.</p>",1361

While the species is generally not great for handling, they are quiet, clean, and easy to care for. And, as far as scorpions go, they are docile. Emperor scorpions require a reasonably long-term commitment, and finding a willing pet sitter might pose a problem. This scorpion is the one most often recommended for first-time scorpion owners, though it's not an advisable pet for young children.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Emperor scorpion, imperial scorpion</p> <p>Adult Size: About 6 inches long</p><p>Lifespan: 6 to 8 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Emperor Scorpion? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>While they may be difficult to find as pets, it is completely legal to own an emperor scorpion as a pet. The emperor scorpion is one of numerous scorpions suitable to pet ownership, including the dictator scorpion, Asian forest scorpion, and desert hairy scorpion.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>When shopping for any pet, including a pet emperor scorpion, it's important to consider if your lifestyle is suitable for the pet of your choosing. While owning a scorpion is ethical, that only remains true if you can properly care for it, providing the environment, food, and attention that it needs to thrive. Additionally, emperor scorpions are nocturnal, which may impact your sleep patterns or habits.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Like most scorpions, the emperor scorpion will sting if provoked. While its venom is among the mildest, it still is not a suitable pet for a household with small children or members who are at risk while handling the pet (or if it gets free from its cage). Ensure you do your research before purchasing and caring for an emperor scorpion, taking care to buy the right materials, supplies, and food.</p><h2>Emperor Scorpion Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Emperor scorpions are not particularly dangerous compared to other scorpion species. It will rarely sting or pinch unless it's feeling threatened. Their sting is similar to a bee sting it's painful, but medical attention or intervention is not usually necessary. That being said, like with bees, some people may get an anaphylactic or severe allergic reaction to the venom, which would require medical attention.</p><p>Emperor scorpions are more likely to pinch you with their pedipalps (claws) than use their stinger. In any case, handling pet scorpions isn't recommended because of these risks, plus handling can stress out a scorpion. If you must handle your scorpion (such as when cleaning its cage), use a pair of long-handled forceps with foam over the grips to pick up the scorpion by the stinging end.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Emperor Scorpion</h3><h2>Housing </h2><p>Emperor scorpions can be kept alone or housed in groups. Glass aquarium tanks are typically the easiest housing choice, but whatever tank you choose should have a tight-fitting and secure lid. A 10-gallon tank is sufficient for one scorpion, but a larger one (20 to 30 gallons) is necessary for groups. However, you don't want to give them too much space it can make it too difficult for them to catch their prey.</p><p>A good rule of thumb is to provide a couple more hiding spots than you have scorpions so they can each have their own space. If there is any sign of aggression between the scorpions, consider separating them to prevent injuries.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Some emperor scorpion owners use soil as bedding, some use peat, and others select vermiculite. No matter what you choose, it should be fairly deep (3 to 6 inches) in order to allow your scorpion to dig burrows. You can also provide pieces of bark, flat stones, broken ceramic flower pots, or even reptile hides as hiding spots for your scorpion.</p><p>Adding pieces of sphagnum moss on top of the substrate will also aid in retaining moisture in the environment. Emperor scorpions will move the cage decorations and furnishings around as they please, and you should let them undoing the arrangement of their habitat may stress them out.</p><h3>Specific Humidity and Heating Needs </h3><p>Emperor scorpions arenative to Africa and live in a humid, warm environment, so the most challenging part of keeping scorpions is providing them with vital heat and sufficient humidity. Emperor scorpion habitats should have a high humidity level (around 75 percent) maintained by regular, daily misting. Regardless of the substrate type you choose, it should be kept damp but not wet. If there is mold on the substrate or condensation on the walls of the tank, the humidity is too high.</p><p>Emperor scorpions do not need UVB lights but they do needa temperature gradient between70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Many scorpion owners even recommend occasionally allowing temperatures to reach about 100 degrees. The temperature gradient is essential to enable these cold-blooded arachnids to regulate their body temperature as needed.</p><p>The easiest way to provide this heating gradient is by using a heating mat designed for use under reptile tanks. The mat should go under no more than about 1/3 of the tank so that your emperor scorpion can move from warmer to cooler temperatures as desired. Always verify appropriate temperatures by using accurate thermometers in a few locations within the cage.</p><h2>What Do Emperor Scorpions Eat & Drink? </h2><p>In the wild, emperor scorpions eat a variety of insects, other arthropods, and small lizards. In captivity, they seem to do fine with a diet primarily of gut-loaded, calcium-dusted crickets, supplemented occasionally with other insects such as mealworms and moths.</p><p>An adult emperor scorpion will eat about three to six adult crickets per week and should be fed every other night. Provide a shallow water dish that allows the scorpion to drink if it needs to, but not deep enough that it can drown.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>A frequent problem with scorpions is dehydration. If your emperor scorpion is lethargic or has a shriveled appearance, this may be a sign that your emperor scorpion is not getting enough water. Consult with your exotics veterinarian if you notice your pet behaving strangely. Usually, if you increase the humidity in its enclosure, it will help.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>From birth, scorpions molt or shed their exoskeleton six times until reaching adulthood (roughly three years of age). Molting is normal and expected. A few days before a molt, the scorpion may hide, remain inactive, and not feed. If you notice its outer shell beginning to crack, it is likely molting. During this time, you'll want to remove any visible, living insects in the cage or other cage mates during this time it is vulnerable to attacks, including insect bites. You can also, increase the cage humidity to make the process easier on your pet.</p><p>Once it starts molting, an emperor scorpion takes about a half-day to shed its skin, then a week for the new outer layer to harden. Do not feed the scorpion during this time wait until the new exoskeleton is completely hardened. Incomplete molts characterized by areas of the exoskeleton that did not molt completely, damaged limbs, or exposed areas can be a life-threatening situation, so you may want to consult an exotics vet if you notice any problem with the shed process.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Emperor Scorpion </h2><p>Many pet stores carry scorpions and other invertebrate pets, but it is preferable if you can locate a reputable breeder. Seek out a seasoned and reputable reptile breeder to help source and determine the right scorpion for you pet stores usually do not know much about an animal, its care, or even how old it is. Breeders often have a more detailed record of a scorpion's life, health history, and care requirements. An emperor scorpion can cost anywhere from $25 up to $100, depending on its size, age, appearance, and more.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Emperor Scorpion </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother spiders and insectsthat make good pets.</p><p>No. The venom of the emperor scorpion is not deadly and most people will have a mild response, similar to that of an insect bite, if bitten by an emperor scorpion.</p><p>With the proper living conditions and care, an emperor scorpion can live anywhere from two to six years.</p><p>Often considered a ""beginner"" scorpion, emperor scorpions are among the easiest to care for and a great options for new scorpion owners.</p>",1342

Also referred to as the Robo dwarf hamster, these little rodents are generally quite quick and curious, though they also can be timid. Most are docile creatures and can coexist with other hamsters of their species. Plus, they can learn to be comfortable around people.</p><p>However, they aren't the easiest to hand-tame due to their small size, quickness, and timid nature. They're usually sandy in color, though they come in several different variations, and they have white spots above their eyes that look like eyebrows. Robo hamsters are simple to care for, requiring a pretty straightforward diet and regular habitat cleaning.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Robo hamster, Roborovski hamster, Robo dwarf hamster</p> <p>Adult Size: 2 inches long on average, weighing around 1 ounce</p><p>Lifespan: 2 to 4 years in captivity</p><h2>Robo Hamster Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Robo hamsters are nocturnal, typically waking up around dusk and staying active throughout the night. While they sometimes make very soft vocalizations, it is their nighttime movement that might create a noise issue for some people. If you're a light sleeper, you probably shouldn't keep their enclosure in your bedroom.</p><p>These hamsters are fairly low-maintenance pets, and they can be quite entertaining to watch. But they're not very cuddly animals and generally don't like a lot of handling. While they're usually docile, they might nip if you startle them.</p><p>Still, they can learn to recognize their humans and might come to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby (especially if you're offering a treat). They should be kept away from other household pets, but they can live with other Robo hamsters in same-sex pairs or small groups. They get along best with each other if they're raised together from a young age. Otherwise, there might be some territorial issues.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Tiny and Swift Roborovski Hamster</h3><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Robo hamsters stretch about two inches long and weigh around an ounce. At birth, they're less than an inch long. They reach maturity at around 2 months old.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Opt for an enclosure that's at least two feet long, one foot wide, and one foot high. Bigger is always better, as this will be the primary area where your animal gets its exercise and mental stimulation. Habitat options are generally either a glass or plastic aquarium with a secure top that has ventilation or a wire cage with a plastic base. Ensure that any wire spacing is narrow enough that your hamster can't squeeze through.</p><p>At minimum, include an exercise wheel with a solid surface (not bars) for your hamster to run on, as well as chew toys. And add a nest or sleeping hut where your hamster can go to feel secure. Also, keep the enclosure away from drafts and direct sunlight.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>On the bottom of the enclosure, add a 1- to 2-inch layer of bedding. Options include chemical- and dye-free shredded paper or aspen shavings. Do not use any cedar or pine shavings or corncob byproduct bedding, as this can cause health issues.</p><h2>What Do Robo Hamsters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Select a commercial hamster food that's specifically formulated for dwarf hamsters. Follow the label's feeding instructions, and consult your veterinarian on the quantity as well. In general, you should feed your hamster daily by putting the food in a small dish. The ideal time to do this is in the evening when the hamster is just waking up. Discard uneaten food after 24 hours.</p><p>You also may offer small amounts of supplemental foods, including certain seeds, grains, fruits, and veggies. Some options include oats, blueberries, and carrots. Consult your vet for appropriate foods for your hamster, as well as the quantity you can feed. Remove any perishable foods from the enclosure after a few hours to prevent spoilage.</p><p>Finally, always have fresh water available for your hamster. You can offer it either in a small dish or a bottle. A bottle will typically remain more sanitary, but not all hamsters know how to use it at first. Keep both a water dish and a bottle in the habitat until you're sure the hamster is drinking from the bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <h3>Tip</h3><p>Before acquiring a Robo hamster, make sure there is a veterinarian nearby who specializes in this animal.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>Calm, gentle handling from a young age can help to hand-tame your hamster, though some hamsters will never be comfortable with handling. Never squeeze or jostle your hamster in your hands. Sit on the ground in a secure space when handling your hamster. You never want to drop a hamster from even a couple of feet off the ground, as this can seriously injure the small animal. To encourage your hamster to sit on your hands, try holding a favorite treat and making the handling a positive experience.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Hamsters can be prone to obesity and other health issues if they don't get enough exercise. This is why it's important to provide an exercise wheel, along with as large of an enclosure as you can fit and afford. There are also exercise balls that hamsters can roam around in outside of their enclosure. Make sure the ball is suitable for a dwarf hamster, and always monitor it outside of the enclosure.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Hamsters are generally clean animals that are good at self-grooming. They don't require baths. But if they do get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can help clean it off by gently rubbing the fur with a damp cloth.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>On a monthly basis, your primary costs for a Robo hamster will be its food and bedding. Depending on the varieties you choose, plus how big your enclosure is, expect to pay between $20 and $40 monthly. You'll also have to periodically replace chew sticks, nests, and other toys at a cost of around $10 on average. In addition, factor an annual veterinary wellness checkup into your budget, as well as emergency vet care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Robo Hamster as a Pet </h2><p>Robo hamsters are interesting little animals that are entertaining to watch and fairly easy to maintain. They're also quiet and don't take up a lot of space. However, they're not the cuddliest of pets. And they're nocturnal, so you might not see them at their most active.

Expect to pay around $20, though this can vary depending on factors such as the animal's age and level of tameness.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>An exotic veterinarian might be able to recommend a good Robo hamster breeder. Look for a breeder that allows you to visit with the animals before you choose one. Try to find an animal that is active and alert, though take into account that you might be visiting with it during its normal sleeping hours. It should be kept in sanitary conditions and have clean fur and clear eyes. Its droppings also should be well-formed.</p><p>If you have multiple hamsters and aren't interested in becoming a breeder yourself, make sure to keep them individually or with members of the same sex.

They are generally easy to care for and docile, making good pets for first-time tarantula owners. Still, like any tarantula, they might defend themselves if they feel threatened. The females are tan in color while the males have black legs and a red abdomen. As pets, desert blond tarantulas require housing that mimics their natural habitat as well as live prey.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Desert blond tarantula, western desert tarantula, Arizona blond tarantula, Mexican blond tarantula</p> <p>Adult Size: Roughly 5-inch leg span</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 30 years (females), 5 to 10 years (males)</p><h2>Desert Blond Tarantula Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>In the wild, these tarantulas dig long, deep burrows; they produce a silk-like thread to use as a covering over the entrance. The silk not only entraps prey, but it also helps to reinforce the burrow. As pets, desert blond tarantulas usually remain in the open and are fun to watch as they dig and climb, though they are mostly active at night. They are quiet and solitary animals that should be housed alone. They also should be kept away from other household pets to avoid stress and injury.</p><p>Desert blond tarantulas are typically restful and easygoing animals. Plan to spend a few hours on feeding and cleaning per week, and then just enjoy watching your spider. Some are comfortable with gentle handling, though they should never be squeezed or jostled. It's also important to sit on the floor when you handle your spider, as even a drop from a few feet can be seriously damaging to this animal. </p><p>But like other tarantulas, these spiders do have a venomous bite. They are also able to flick barbed hairs from their abdomens at perceived threats, which can cause skin irritation and be very damaging if they get in your eyes. So you should always wash your hands after handling your tarantula or anything in its enclosure.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Tarantula venom is toxic and will cause a reaction that's similar to a bee sting in most people. However, some people with allergies might have more serious reactions and should seek immediate medical attention.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Desert blond tarantulas have a leg span that stretches around 5 inches across. The female spiders have slightly larger bodies than the males.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A 5- to 10-gallon plastic or glass tank with a secure top that has ventilation is suitable for desert blond tarantulas. As a general rule, the length of the tank should be three times the spider's leg span, the width should be two to three times the leg span, and the height should be about a foot. Avoid very tall tanks, as these spiders do climb and can be injured if they fall from a great height.</p><p>It's best to keep the tank between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, though as desert dwellers these tarantulas are fairly hardy to temperature fluctuations. A humidity level between 65 and 70 percent is ideal, which can be measured using a hydrometer.</p><p>Within the tank, add cork bark, half a hollow log, half a small clay flower pot on its side, or something similar that the spider can use as shelter.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Three or more inches of peat moss, soil, or vermiculite can be used as a substrate. Plan to change the substrate roughly every four to six months.</p><h2>What Do Desert Blond Tarantulas Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Feed your desert blond tarantula live crickets and other insects, such as mealworms and roaches. As a general rule, the insect should be smaller than the spider's body. The crickets should be gut-loaded (fed nutritious foods), so that nutrition passes on to your spider.</p><p>Adult tarantulas usually eat once or twice a week while juveniles can eat every day or two. Consult your vet for the proper quantity and frequency to feed for your particular spider. To feed, simply drop the live prey near your spider. Remove any unwanted food after 24 hours, as it can begin to stress the spider.</p><p>Also, always keep a shallow dish of fresh water in the enclosure. Make sure your spider can get in and out of the dish easily, as deep water can be a drowning hazard.Refresh the water daily.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>As pets, desert blond tarantulas are typically very hardy and don't often have health problems as long as they're kept in the proper environment.</p><p>A natural occurrence that some new owners might mistake as a health problem is the spider's molting process. This is when tarantulas shed their old exoskeleton and form a new one. During the process, the spider might become very lethargic and lose its appetite. It might even roll onto its back with its legs curled, appearing dead.</p><p>The whole molting process can take a few weeks. Don't handle your spider during this time, as this can damage the fragile new exoskeleton. Likewise, refrain from feeding live prey until the exoskeleton hardens. If you think the molt is abnormal or taking too long, consult an exotic pet veterinarian.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians accept tarantulas as patients. So if you're thinking about acquiring a desert blond tarantula, first make sure there's a vet nearby who will treat it.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Tarantulas need exercise like any animal to keep them in good body condition and help prevent illness. However, they don't require an excessive amount. As long as their enclosure is sufficiently sized, they should be able to get the physical activity they need.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Desert blond tarantulas groom themselves via their molting process. And they generally don't require any help from you during this time. Just make sure their environment is at the proper temperature and humidity to keep them comfortable.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>From month to month, your main cost for a desert blond tarantula will be its diet. Expect to spend between $5 and $10 on average. You can lessen this cost by raising crickets yourself rather than purchasing them from a pet store. For periodic substrate changes, as well as replacing anything that's worn in the enclosure, plan to spend around $10 to $20. Also, don't forget to budget for routine veterinary care and emergencies.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Desert Blond Tarantula as a Pet </h2><p>Desert blond tarantulas are interesting pets to keep. They're also quiet, don't take up much space, and don't need a lot of attention. However, if you want a very active pet, they probably won't be right for you. And you must handle them with care due to their defense mechanisms.</p><h2>Similar Spiders to the Desert Blond Tarantula </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother exotic animalsthat can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Desert Blond Tarantula </h2><p>You might be able to find a desert blond tarantula at a pet shop, but it's better to go through a reputable breeder or rescue group. That way, you'll be more likely to get adequate information on the animal's health and history. Expect to pay around $50 on average, though this can vary based on factors such as age. Also, females generally cost more because they live longer.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Check with local exotic animal veterinarians to find a good tarantula breeder or rescue organization. The main benefit of going to a breeder is you'll probably have a wider selection of younger animals. Always try to see the animals in person before bringing one home. Note whether the spider appears to be in good body condition and alert, and ask to see it eat if possible (as appetite often correlates with health). Finally, to avoid becoming an accidental breeder yourself, keep multiple tarantulas housed individually.</p><p>Desert blond tarantulas can be good pets for kids who understand their handling limitations. The children also must be comfortable with feeding live prey.</p><p>Desert blond tarantulas are generally low-maintenance pets, requiring feedings each week and periodic substrate changes.</p><p>These spiders have a generally docile demeanor, and some are comfortable with gentle handling. However, they will never be cuddly or tame pets.</p>",1332

None of the six surviving species of tiger (another three are extinct) should be kept as pets. A majority of states in the U.S. have instituted bans on keeping any of the big cat species as pets. Tigers are huge, strong, fanged predators that eat dozens of pounds of meat per day and need acres of expensive high-security enclosures. The risk of attack far outweighs any benefit, which makes tigers not suitable as pets at any age. However, if you are curious, here are some details about what it's like keeping these large cats living alongside humans.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAME: Tiger</p> <p>ADULT SIZE: up to 10 feet long from head to tail</p><p>LIFESPAN: up to 20 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Tiger? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Most states have restrictions on owning many exotic pets including big cats, especially around heavily populated communities. Specifically, 35 states have bans on keeping big cats, while 21 states ban all dangerous exotic pets. Check the laws in your area before attempting to acquire a tiger or any other big cat; The Big Cat Public Safety Act is pending federal legislation aimed at prohibiting private citizens from owning big cats.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Tigers belong in the wild, ideally. In captivity, tigers can fare well within spacious zoos or big cat rescue preserves, but they are not well adapted to be healthy or happy in a house with an ordinary yard.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Pet enthusiasts cannot give a tiger the life it needs because it has adapted over eons to inhabit spacious wildlands in specific geographic regions. Keeping a tiger in a small space such as a house or yard can place the tiger's life, and its keepers' lives, in danger. It is a better idea to visit tigers in a zoo where you can observe and enjoy their presence in a safer and more natural setting.</p><h2>Tiger Behavior and Temperament </h2><h3>Warning</h3> <p>Well before their first year, a tiger cub grows big enough to push down an adult human. Even their play bites can cause serious damage and potentially kill their owner or other people nearby.</p><p>Tigers are large, strong, and dangerous cats. They have the ability to take down a 500-pound running antelope, are strong swimmers, and are extremely territorial. In the wild, male tigers will cover a territory of up to almost 40 miles; females cover roughly a seven-mile territory. Males mark their territories by spraying urine and dropping feces in strategic locations. Tigers typically live solitary lives except for mating and periods of time when mothers are raising cubs.</p><p>Although tiger cubs are small and cute, in their first year alone they will grow to hundreds of pounds and have canine teeth and claws that are inches long. Tigers should never be declawed, as they use their claws for walking. Removing their large teeth would also prevent them from being able to effectively eat their food.</p><p>Many tigers are carefully and strategically trained to be around people and will go years without incident, but you cannot effectively predict the behavior of a tiger they are still wild animals at heart. Famous trainers have been mauled and killed by their beloved tigers, even after working with them daily for years.</p><p>Many of the reported attacks from tigers in the United States have been severe attacks; non-lethal maulings happen less frequently. Approximately 260 exotic cat attacks that resulted in injuries were recorded as severe or fatal.Of all reported attacks from 16 non-domesticated feline species, spanning 1990 to 2014, roughly 50 percent of the attacks were from just one genus: tigers.</p><p>Statistics over the same time period show that most fatal attacks or injuries occurred at unaccredited facilities and private menageries. Attacks were also common at accredited institutions, coming from well-trained performing animals during a show or when taken for a walk in or near the public. Big cat safety issues in the United States have been sufficient to influence legislators around the country to create both state and federal laws banning the ownership of tigers.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Tigers need many acres of a highly secured landscape; they can and do jump, climb, and swim their way out of many enclosures constructed to be tiger-proof. Tigers have been known to escape from zoos and private properties and have killed people they come across. In the wild, they roam on several miles of land, so a large plot of fenced-in land with access to ponds or small lakes, trees, and shelters is what a captive tiger needs to be safe from the world and to keep humans safe from them.</p><p>Even in a large enclosure, a tiger's owner must provide enrichment opportunities. Tigers need to use their predator brains to catch, play, jump, climb, and explore; a bored tiger will be an unhealthy tiger. Zoos often use large plastic balls that tigers will jump on in pools and offer hanging containers with food inside as well as large tree limb apparatus areas to climb in and on. Without complex enrichment regimes, tigers can and do get bored to the point of medical depression.</p><h2>What Do Tigers Eat and Drink? </h2><p>The amount of food needed for a tiger will vary with gender and age, but an adult tiger may consume up to 88 pounds of meat at one time antelope, gazelle, water buffalo, deer, and fish comprise a tiger's diet. But, these opportunistic carnivores will eat just about any animal they can catch.</p><p>According to the Smithsonian National Zoo, their resident tigers eat mostly ground beef provided by keepers. These tigers' diet is supplemented with ""enrichment items,"" such as knucklebones, cow femurs, and rabbit carcasses.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The Big Cat Rescueorganization advises that in most areas it is difficult to find a veterinarian who is willing or even able to care for a tiger of any age. They further report that a full 98 percent of all wild big cat species die within two years of being taken into captivity. Tigers are vulnerable to many of the same life-threatening illnesses that affect house cats, such as feline distemper, rabies, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and the feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Therefore, captive tigers must be vaccinated against these diseases, just like domestic cats.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Because tigers have evolved to inhabit and roam over large regions of land, they are an animal that needs a lot of exercise to stay healthy and happy. Tigers in small spaces will pace relentlessly to quell their instinctive urge to travel; they can suffer anxiety and depression as a result.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Tigers groom themselves quite effectively with their rough tongues, much like house cats do. They also enjoy swimming, but it is more for cooling down than cleaning up.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Body Weight: 200 to 575 pounds (male); 170 to 390 pounds (female)</p><p>Head and Body Length: 6 to 10 feet (male); 4 to 6 feet (female)</p><p>Tail Length: 3 to 4 feet (male); 2 to 3 feet (female)</p><h2>Purchasing a Tiger </h2><p>According to Big Cat Rescue, a tiger cub is at the top of the price range for exotic cats, at around $7,500. Big Cat Rescue also advises that owners should expect to spend up to $20,000 for a cage sufficient to house a full-grown tiger, let alone the cost of the wide landscape this large predator will require in order to thrive.</p><h2>Domestic Cats Similar to the Tiger </h2><p>If you're attracted to tigers but don't want to put yourself and those around you at risk of lethal accidents, you might consider other smaller cats that are more manageable.</p><p>Otherwise, investigateother exotic animalsthat might make good pets.</p><p>The few tigers that remain in the wild inhabit parts of India, Sumatra, and eastern Russia. They once ranged throughout Asia, Iran, Java, and Bali but are now extirpated from those areas.</p><p>The Amur tiger, also known as the Siberian tiger, is the biggest cat of the species.</p>",1318

Due to being low-maintenance lizards and easy to care for, they are considered to be good pets for both children and beginners. Skinks are native to Australia and got their name from their distinct blue tongues. Although they are known to be beginner pets, they require a large amount of space for their habitat and specific substrates that fit their needs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Blue-tongued skink</p> <p>Adult Size: Up to 20 inches long</p><p>Lifespan: Between 10 and 20 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Blue-Tongued Skink? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>It is completely legal to own a blue-tongued skink as a personal pet, though they do require special permits to sell. Because the lizard is native to Australia and parts of Indonesia, you will likely have to go through a specialty breeder to acquire a blue-tongued skink.</p><h2>Blue-Tongued Skink Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Blue-tongued skinks are ground dwellers with a flattened andelongated body somewhat resembling a snake in appearance. They are docile, quiet, gentle, and easily tamed, which is why they make great beginner pets. Native to Australia, these calm pet lizards have distinct blue tongues (which is how they got their name), short legs, and dull teeth. In the wild, blue-tongued skinks spend all their time on the ground.</p><p>Be advised that although skinks are not aggressive, they have strong jaws and teeth, and a bite from a skink can be quite painful. Despite their generally docile nature, blue-tongued skinks will bite if they feel threatened, or hiss and expose their tongues. Try to avoid provoking or startling them, and don't let small children interact with a skink without proper supervision.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Blue-tongued skinks requirea large enclosure, such as a 40- to 55-gallon tank, with a secure lid. Provide a large, shallow, and sturdy water dish inside skinks like to bathe in their water but also often defecate there, so frequent cleaning will be required.</p><p>Blue-tongued skinks don't need branches for climbing since they are strictly ground dwellers. Instead, provide them with acouple of sturdy hiding spots since they like to burrow and hide. Cork bark, wood, rocks, PVC pipes, or other reptile hideouts can be used.</p><p>Skinks are used to ample sunlight, and UVA/UVB rays help with their metabolism, bone health, and more. To ensure they get the nutrients they need, provide your pet with full spectrum UVA/UVB light for between 10 and 12 hours per day. This bulb will have specific instructions on how far away to keep it from your skink but typically it is about 10 to 12 inches. You should also make sure nothing is blocking the light from reaching your skink, except for a metal mesh screen if necessary.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>The substrate (bedding) in your blue-tongued skink's environment can consist of aspen wood shavings, cypress mulch, or even newspaper. Whatever you choose, make sure your skink is not eating it or your lizard could get an intestinal blockage. Any wood pieces or rocks should be firmly placed so they will not fall on the lizard.</p><h3>Specific Humidity and Heating Needs </h3><p>Since blue-tongued skinks are native to Australia (just like bearded dragons and frill-necked lizards), temperatures should be kept warm, with a thermal gradient of75 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit and a basking spot of 95 degrees Fahrenheit. A combination of under-tank heating and a basking light on one side of the tank works well.</p><p>Ensure the appropriate temperature gradient is provided by measuring temperatures in various spots around the tank, not just one. Nighttime temperatures can drop to about 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but temperatures any cooler than that can cause several problems with your skink and make it more prone to getting ill. A humidity hide (such as a plastic storage box with moss or cypress mulch to hold moisture) will help your skink with shedding its skin.</p><h2>What Do Blue-Tongued Skinks Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Skinks are true omnivores and this preference should be reflected in their diet. Variety is the key to providing a nutritious diet to a blue-tongued skink, and a calcium/vitamin D supplement should be added to their food regularly to help prevent metabolic bone disease. You should also strive for a balanced mixture of about 60 percent vegetables and fruits and 40 percent meat items.</p><p>You can feed your skink canned dog food or a pinkie mouse occasionally. Otherwise, stay away from items that aren't fruits, vegetables, or insects. Too much protein isn't good for lizards' digestive systems or kidneys. Younger skinks can be fed six days in a row, allowing them to fast on the seventh day. Adult skinks can be fed every other day or even every two days, depending on their size and appetite.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>In general, blue-tongued skinks are very easy to care for and are not known to have major health issues. The most common health problem among skinks (as well as other reptiles) in captivity is metabolic bone disease. This condition occurs when the animal's phosphorous-to-calcium ratio is out of balance and is usually due to poor UV lighting and sometimes poor diet. Symptoms include weakened or fractured bones, tremors, lethargy, and overall weakness. Like other lizards, skinks can also suffer from vitamin A deficiency a supplement can help prevent this from becoming serious.</p><p>Another common issue for blue-tongued skinks and all lizards is mouth rot, which is characterized by a foamy or cheesy secretion that comes from the mouth, teeth, and lips. It can be caused by an eating injury or stress and should be treated by a professional. Before you purchase your blue-tongued skink, be sure there's a veterinarian in your area who specializes in exotic pets such as lizards.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Reptiles, including lizards, all shed their skins at some point. The frequency with which blue-tongued skinks shed will depend on their age young skinks under a year of age will shed every two to three weeks, while adult skinks will shed only once every two to three months.</p><p>If your skink isn't able to shed fully, or sheds irregularly, it may be a sign of an underlying health issue, also known as dysecdysis. Skinks shed in patches (rather than all over like a snake), so it can be harder to recognize when they're shedding incompletely. If you notice your skink having issues, try boosting the humidity in their enclosure, especially around the time of a shed. Otherwise, you may need to visit an exotics vet to help your skink properly shed and treat the underlying issue.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Blue-Tongued Skink </h2><p>Try to get your skink from a reputable breeder, who will have the animal's health history available. Your lizard should have clear eyes and skin that is free of blemishes or dry patches (which may indicate a skin condition). If you can watch the animal eat before purchasing, you'll be able to tell if it has a healthy appetite. A lizard that is limping, has any visible deformities, or shows signs of an incomplete shed is probably one with health issues and should be avoided.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Blue-Tongued Skink </h2> <p>Otherwise, you can check out these other profiles ofreptile and amphibian breeds.</p><p>No. Though they can bite if they feel threatened or attacked, blue-tongued skinks are considered docile reptiles and are not dangerous to keep as pets.</p><p>It's thought by experts that blue-tongued skinks developed their signature colorful tongue as a way to intimidate predators in the wild.</p><p>Blue-tongued skinks are known to live longer in captivity than in the wild, reaching 20 years but sometimes closer to 30 years with the proper care and nutrition.</p>",1263
57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-wallabies-1238323,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Should You Keep Wallaby as a Pet? </h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep Wallaby as a Pet? </h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Wallabies may be cute and fascinating animals, but it's illegal to own them in most states, and they don't make the best pets. These smaller relatives of kangaroos are not easily domesticated and cannot be house-trained. If allowed to roam around inside your house, a wallaby will not only urinate and defecate, it may also jump erratically, endangering itself (and your furniture). Like their cousins, the wallaroos, wallabies must be kept away from cats to prevent transmission of deadly toxoplasmosis, a parasite that even healthy cats can carry. Wallabies require daily access to fresh grass, a spacious enclosure, and a lot more attentive care than the average domestic pet.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Wallaby, brush wallaby, rock wallaby, hare wallaby, nail-tail wallaby, scrub wallaby, short-tailed scrub, swamp wallaby, forest wallaby</p><p>Scientific Names: ., ., spp., and</p><p>Adult Size: About 18 to 40 inches (head to tail), 4 to 55 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 12 to 17 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Wallaby? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Check your state and local laws to confirm the current legality of owning a pet wallaby. Colorado is one of the few states that may allow ownership of this wild marsupial with the proper permits, but cities may have additional regulations that must be followed.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>It is, of course, unethical to illegally own any pet. Beyond the legality issue, few people have the space, time, or resources to properly house and care for a wallaby. This animal needs a lot of space that not only allows it to jump and exercise but also keeps it from escaping or being attacked by predators. Without a suitable enclosure, a wallaby would need constant supervision to prevent it from destroying property or harming itself among its unfamiliar human surroundings. If this commitment is unfeasible, then it's unethical to try to keep a wallaby in captivity.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Keeping a wallaby is simply too great a responsibility for the average pet owner. This animal is poorly suited to live in a house or a suburban backyard, and trying to confine a wallaby to this lifestyle will compromise its health and happiness. Despite their cuteness and animated behavior, wallabies are better left in the wild or in zoos that specialize in caring for them.</p><h2>Wallaby Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Some wallabies are docile and friendly while others are jumpy and anxious; many do not have a mild temperament at all. They fare best in same-species groups because they live communally in the wild. Wallabies are macropods (the term for the family that includes kangaroos), and these animals exhibit some behaviors that are unfamiliar to pet owners in the U.S. Licking and salivating on their paws and arms is a normal behavior of wallabies; it cools them down in a hot environment. Also, some wallabies normally regurgitate their food before lying down and then re-consume it. Young wallabies may bond to their keepers, but older wallabies tend to be more shy and wary of human interaction.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A common way to determine an adequately sized outdoor wallaby enclosure is to make the minimum height and width four times the length of your wallaby; make the length of your enclosure eight times the length of your wallaby. This size will need to increase exponentially if you have more than one wallaby.</p><p>These animals can survive both warm and cool weather, but they need supplemental heat or to be housed indoors when temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. They can live outside in warm months or year-round if they have a dog house with supplemental heat to use as a retreat.</p><h3>Specific Substrate </h3><p>The ideal wallaby enclosure is a spacious outdoor area with a natural ground substrate that includes a renewable supply of freshly growing grass year-round or from spring through fall in temperate zones.</p><h2>What Does a Wallaby Eat and Drink? </h2><p>There are a variety of food options for pet wallabies, but natural grass (untreated with chemicals) should be a staple. As herbivores, they spend their days grazing on grasses in the wild. Without access to grass, a wallaby's digestive system can be upset.</p><p>Try to provide daily access to sweetgrass, orchard grass, or timothy hay. This mainly grass-based diet should be supplemented with wallaby pellets, a few fresh green vegetables, and apples as occasional treats. If wallaby pellets are not available, then rabbit or horse pellets may be used. To top off a complete and balanced diet, place a mineral block in the enclosure.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>It is common for wallabies to get intestinal parasites like roundworms. They can also develop vitamin E and selenium deficiencies if eating an unbalanced diet. Other ailments wallabies may suffer are ringworm (a fungal skin infection) and salmonellosis (a disease caused by a bacteria in the mouth referred to as ""lumpy jaw""). Annual check-ups with an exotic animal veterinarian and routine fecal parasite exams are recommended to maintain a wallaby's health.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>You can't take a wallaby for a walk on a leash like a domestic dog. They don't enjoy it and may aggressively try to escape. Wallabies are naturally adapted to a life of freely roaming the wide, open plains of Australia. This means that they need a lot of exercise in captivity to mimic the crawling, jumping, and active grazing these animals' bodies require. The best way to make sure your wallaby gets enough exercise is by providing a large enough enclosure to allow unrestricted movement.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Wallabies are good at grooming themselves and their family members. They keep their fur clean by licking every inch of it with their tongues. There is no need to bathe or brush wallabies since they stay tidy all by themselves.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Wallabies are commonly mistaken for miniature kangaroos. Although they belong to the same taxonomic family, these mid-sized macropods are different animals. There are eight species of wallaby, and their sizes range widely from 4 pounds up to 53 pounds. The smallest wallaby species is about 18 inches from head to tail, while the largest species are closer to 40 inches.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Wallaby as a Pet </h2><p>The advantage of owning a wallaby is the joy of sharing the company of an animated, cute, and curious wild animal. On the downside, it is illegal in most places and the unfeasibility of providing proper housing and care makes owning a wallaby a generally bad idea.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Wallaby </h2><p>Purchasing a wallaby is a tricky business since most states ban their sale and ownership. Most sellers of wallabies are likely to be operating illegally and may even work with poachers or other illegal outfits to obtain wallabies, which is not only unethical but potentially cruel to the animals. Instead of trying to purchase a wallaby, consider donating to support their habitat in the wild and visiting wallabies to watch their amusing natural behavior in a zoo.</p><h2>Similar Animals to the Wallaby </h2> <p>Keeping a wallaby is hard work. It requires the construction of a large outdoor enclosure with plentiful grasses for food. Wallabies can not easily be kept inside a house because they can't be potty trained and may damage property or hurt themselves when hopping.</p><p>Wallabies can live up to 20 years in captivity, making them a long-term commitment for their keepers or owners.</p><p>Wallabies and dogs can get along if introduced under strict supervision. Wallabies can not interact with cats, though, because they are vulnerable to fatal infections of toxoplasmosis parasites that cats carry and shed in their feces.</p>",1248
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/iguanas-as-pets-1236880,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Iguana: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Iguana: Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Iguanas are one of the most popular pet lizards. They are native to Central and South America. However, iguanas are a major commitment and need a high level of care. They have strict feeding and housing requirements, can grow quite large, live a long time, and can be very strong. Additionally, they can also be difficult to tame and might become aggressive if not regularly handled.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Iguana, green iguana, American iguana</p> <p>Adult Size:Up to 20 pounds and up to 7 feet long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years in captivity, though up to 20 years is not uncommon</p><h2>Iguana Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Pet iguanas will never be truly domesticated animals, and many of them will try to escape their enclosures and even your home. Captive iguanas need to be picked up and held routinely for taming purposes, so they can learn to trust you and be comfortable in their environment. However, this can be a challenge because they often find human contact unnatural and might resist it. So it's important to handle your iguana with care and patience.</p><p>Baby iguanas can move quickly, but adult iguanas often become quite lazy and docile, at least when they don't feel threatened. When out of their cage, some iguanas might prefer to climb on their owners. They do have sharp claws, so wear protective clothing if your pet iguana likes this activity. Additionally, an iguana can cause real harm with its tail. An adult iguana's tail is strong enough to break a human bone. While this is relatively rare, iguanas are still powerful creatures. So pay attention to any struggling or aggression when handling them, especially if children or other pets are present.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Popular Iguana</h3><h2>Housing the Iguana </h2><p>Iguanas can grow up to 7 feet long when their tail is included in the measurement, and they generally weigh around 20 pounds. This size often surprises people who start with a little baby iguana. Therefore, an aquarium or a small reptile enclosure is a very short-lived home for a young iguana.</p><p>Most commercially available cages do not meet an iguana's space needs. Many iguana owners opt for custom-built enclosures complete with many ramps, shelves, and branches that this tree-dwelling species can climb. An adequate enclosure for a single iguana is around 12 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 8 feet tall. Many people even choose to convert an entire room or a large closet to their iguana's habitat.</p><p>To keep your iguana's enclosure clean, remove uneaten food, feces, shedded skin, and other visible waste every day. Also, clean the food and water dishes daily. Once a week, move your iguana to a temporary cage to clean its main enclosure. Discard the substrate (the bedding that absorbs waste and odors), and scrub all surfaces and decorations, such as rocks, with a pet-safe cleaner. Wait for everything to dry thoroughly before reassembling the enclosure.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>The iguana is a tropical animal. It wants to bask at 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and its habitat shouldn't drop below 75 degrees Fahrenheit. In fact, the iguana needs a temperature around 85 degrees Fahrenheit to properly digest its food. This should be closely monitored, especially if you're adjusting the climate of an entire room for its habitat. You can use heat lamps typically positioned less than a foot away from basking ledges (follow the instructions on your particular light) to achieve an optimal temperature.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>A large enclosure means a lot of lighting. Use UVB bulbs designed for reptiles to provide your iguana with appropriate light exposure for 10 to 12 hours per day. This mimics the benefits it would get from natural sunlight, namely promoting vitamin D production. Mercury vapor bulbs can be used for large enclosures or rooms, while compact fluorescent lights or tubes can work for small enclosures. Large branches and shelves in the enclosure will allow your tree-dwelling iguana to climb up and bask in these lights.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Iguanas need at least 70% humidity in their environment. You can increase the humidity of your iguana's habitat by adding a pool of water to the enclosure or using a mister. It's generally recommended to mist your iguana two times a day to increase humidity and maintain healthy skin.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>A wood substrate, or bedding, is typically fine for iguanas. Because they're a tree-dwelling species, they spend most of their time climbing instead of burrowing in their bedding.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Fresh food is the key to a healthy iguana. Iguanas in the wild are strict herbivores. They avoid eating animal protein, including insects. In fact, diets high in protein can cause health issues, such as kidney failure, in an iguana.</p><p>In addition to a quality pelleted commercial diet, provide your iguana with dark leafy greens, some fruit, and a calcium supplement. Plus, iguanas need fresh water available at all times. Follow your veterinarian's instructions on the quantity to feed to maintain a healthy weight for your pet's size.</p><p>It's important to remember that iguanas swallow their food whole without chewing, so everything you offer must be chopped or shredded into tiny pieces. Remove and discard any food that hasn't been eaten within 24 hours.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Like most pet reptiles, iguanas carry salmonella. This means salmonella is present in the iguana's digestive tract without causing disease to the animal. But humans can acquire it from touching the iguana or items in its environment.</p><p>Follow common-sense hygiene practices when handling iguanas. Wash your hands well before and after spending time with your pet, and avoid touching your face. This should prevent the spread of the disease in most cases. However, if there are young children, seniors, pregnant women, or immunocompromised people in your home, take extra precautions. An iguana might not be the right pet for your family.</p><p>A common health issue for iguanas is kidney disease, often due to dehydration. If your iguana is lethargic, has swelling on its body, and is frequently drinking or urinating, get it to a vet immediately. Moreover, iguanas often face metabolic bone disease due to insufficient calcium and vitamin D, which is why a calcium supplement and UVB lighting are so important. Also, many iguanas come down with respiratory diseases from habitats that are too cold.</p><p>In terms of behavior, most iguanas can become tame with proper daily handling. They prefer a predictable routine, which makes them feel secure. However, they do have a strong self-defense instinct and will bite, scratch, and whip their tails if they feel threatened.</p><h2>Choosing Your Iguana </h2><p>Iguanas are readily available from pet stores, breeders, and rescue groups. In fact, many end up in rescues when their owners realize they can't meet the species' care needs. They're often available to purchase or adopt for around $20 to $50.</p><p>Don't be fooled by a pet store selling you a small iguana and claiming it will stay that size. These animals grow very quickly. Look for an iguana that is active with clear eyes, healthy skin, and normal feces. Red flags include a low body weight, mucus around the animal's nose or mouth, bumps or sores on its skin, and lethargy.</p><p>Finally, check your local laws or consult with an exotic animal veterinarian to confirm the legality of owning a pet iguana in your area. You also should make sure there's a vet near you who accepts iguanas as patients.</p>",1242

In the wild, the Chinese fire belly newt is found at low and middle elevations around slow-moving bodies of water in China while the Japanese fire belly newt is found in similar locations throughout Japan. With their vivid orange-red markings on their stomachs, fire belly newts make an attractive pet and require only a small enclosure that mimics their environment in the wild.</p><p>Active, hardy, and relatively easy to care for, fire belly newts are a popular choice for beginner amphibian keepers. They're a fun pet to observe, though their somewhat toxic skin secretions make them unwise to handle. Still, once you get them set up with the proper environment and determine their feeding schedule, they can be a low-maintenance, enjoyable companion for many years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Fire belly newt, fire newt, Chinese fire belly newt, oriental fire belly newt, Japanese fire belly newt</p> <p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years on average and up to 30 years</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches long</p><h2>Fire Belly Newt Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>When you first bring home your fire belly newt, it might seem shy and reclusive as it gets used to its new enclosure. But once the newt figures out its new scene, it should be quite lively. Fire belly newts and other aqueous amphibians spend most of their time in the water, coming to land only occasionally. They are nocturnal, feeding and frolicking mostly at night, so they might not be a good choice to keep in a bedroom.</p><p>In the wild, the fire belly newt's markings serve as a warning to predators of its toxic nature. The animal's skin excretes poisonous toxins as a defense mechanism. Thus, they are not good pets to handle and not ideal if you have small children. The toxin can irritate unbroken skin and can even cause numbness, dizziness, and shortness of breath if it gets into a cut or scratch. Plus, it can be very dangerous when ingested.</p><h2>Housing the Fire Belly Newt </h2><p>Housing the fire belly newt requires replicating its natural habitat inside of an aquarium. In the wild, fire belly newts are aquatic, so an ample water source is necessary. However, newts also need a dry land area in the tank, so they can climb out to rest and bask in the artificial sun. While they don't need a huge enclosure, the larger the volume of water is, the less chance of waste buildup. A20-gallontank can house up to four fire belly newts.</p><p>The aquarium's land area can consist of a sloping gravel substrate, replicating the shore of a natural water source. You can create this with plexiglass set in place with aquarium-grade silicone. Rocks, moss, and pieces of bark make great hiding places. And a floating island of wood or rocks, which should be smooth to prevent damaging the newt's delicate skin, can be provided as a supplemental land source.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Fire belly newts thrive in cool temperatures. While they tolerate room temperature, they are happiest between 62 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit. At temperatures above 75 degrees Fahrenheit, fire belly newts can become stressed and susceptible to infection, particularly of the fungal variety. Keeping your newt's tank in the basement can help to maintain optimal temperatures. And in hot weather, positioning a fan over the aquarium or providing a source of melting, dechlorinated ice can help your newt cool off if the ambient room temperature runs high.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Newts should be kept on a regular cycle of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark per day. During the summer, a well-lit room with ample daylight should suffice, as long as the tank isn't in direct sunlight. In the winter, you might need an artificial light on a timer to replicate these conditions. Newts do not have special UV requirements, but a low-watt fluorescent fixture may be used to propagate live plants. Just make sure the newts have a shaded area or shelter they can retreat to.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>To mimic the floor of a natural water source, line the bottom of the tank withsmooth gravel. Make sure the gravel you choose is large enough that the newtcan'tingest it. While plastic plants are easier to care for, you also can provide live plants to maintain homeostasis in the aquarium and keep the water clean and healthy.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>You might have to try a few food sources before finding one that works for your newt. However, bloodworms (frozen or live) seem to be a favorite and are readily available at most pet stores. Fire belly newts also eat earthworms (tip: chop them up first), brine shrimp, glass shrimp, daphnia, and freeze-dried Tubifex cubes. You can also try floating amphibian sticks, but many newts refuse to eat them. Large newts particularly larger Japanese newts also sometimes dine on guppies.</p><p>It can take a little experimentation to figure out how much and how often your newt should be fed. Typically every other day or every three days is sufficient. Monitor your newt's body condition to assess whether you're feeding it too much or too little. Any excess food left in the tank is a telltale sign you're feeding your newt too often, and decaying food will contribute to toxic buildup in the tank.</p><p>Fill your tank with dechlorinated water. Water filtration is crucial to tank health, though strong currents are best avoided. Air-powered corner filters work best and createvery littlecurrent. Internal power filters, positioned on their minimal setting, and under-gravelfilters can also be used. Approximately a third of the tank's water should be removed and replaced with fresh water every one to two weeks, depending on the size of the tank and the number of newts it houses. A gravel washer (available at many pet stores) also makes cleaning easy, as it gently agitates the tank's bottom as the water is siphoned off.</p><h2>Common Health and Behavior Problems </h2><p>Most health problems in captive newts arise from unclean water. Bacteria and fungus can build up in the tank, causing skin lesions and infections. If you notice a lesion on your newt, contact your veterinarian and clean its water promptly. If you catch the problem quickly enough, it should be easy to remedy. However, prolonged unhealthy tank conditions can cause death.</p><p>In terms of behavior, fire belly newts aren't typically territorial or aggressive, allowing them to coexist with other newts of their species. If you must handle your newt, wear impermeable gloves to avoid skin irritation. Also, keep other pets and children away from your newt, as ingesting the toxin can lead to death.</p><h2>ChoosingYour Fire Belly Newt </h2><p>Obtain your fire belly newt from a reputable breeder or rescue group. Look for reptile and amphibian groups online or contact your local pet shop for recommendations. Make sure the seller can give you adequate information on the animal's health and origin, and expect to pay around $20.</p><p>Select a newt with vivid coloring and bright eyes. Cloudy eyes can indicate disease. Its skin should be smooth without any abnormal lesions or other marks. And it should appear well-fed.</p>",1221
60,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-anteaters-4110164,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep an Anteater As a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep an Anteater As a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>No matter how exotic an animal is, it's likely you'll find someone somewhere who is keeping one as a pet. If you have the money, the patience, and the temperament to provide for their needs, an anteater might be the right exotic pet choice for you.</p><p>There are four kinds of anteaters found in the wild, but the species most suitable for adventurous keepers is the Southern anteater (commonly referred to as the lesser anteater). This unique and solitary animal is closely related to the sloth and the armadillo and can be trained to be tame when raised from birth.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Anteater</p> <p>Adult Size: 13 to 35 inches long, with a 15- to 26-inch tail; 3 to 18 pounds</p><p>Lifespan: 7 years (may live into their teens)</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Anteater? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Anteaters are legal to own on a federal level, but specific state regulations can vary from place to place. Before purchasing a pet anteater, it's a good idea to check with state and local ordinances in your area to determine whether owning one would be legal and whether you need a license.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>Like with all pets, it is important to determine if you have the means, time, and energy to care for an animal before purchasing. Anteaters need a detailed amount of care, and are often not a good pet choice for people who work full time out of the home or have young children to take care of.</p><h2>Anteater Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Native to several countries in South America, lesser anteaters reside in trees and on forest floors. They visit many nests each day in search of insects including ants and termites. Lesser anteaters spend much of their time climbing, aided by prehensile tails, which help them move from branch to branch like a monkey. Although their sight is poor, anteaters have a well-developed sense of both smell and hearing.</p><p>If threatened or attacked, anteaters will back up against a tree or grab onto a branch with their tail and defend themselves with their claws. Anteaters also have another line of defense: a liquid that is four times more potent than a skunk'sscent. When this substance is sprayed from the animal's anal glands, it stops predators in their tracks. Anteaters also mark their territory with spray, making them horrid housemates.</p><p>Lesser anteaters are not social; they prefer to live alone, away from other anteaters and pets. For this reason, most pet owners purchase young, hand-raised baby anteaters, whose parents have adapted to humans. However, tame adult anteaters are not a walk in the park either, as they can damage furniture with their claws and urinate and defecate on your belongings.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>In the wild, lesser anteaters spend half of their time in trees, so when kept in captivity, they need ample climbing opportunities. Sturdy tree branches and mounted poles offered both indoors and outdoors must be strong enough to hold the weight of this animal. Provide them in varying diameters for the health of this animal's foot muscles (similar to birds).</p><p>Anteaters have unusually low body temperatures for mammals, so their environment must hover around room temperature at all times. Aim to keep your anteater enclosure at an ambient temperature of 65 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. While some up and down fluctuation is acceptable, an anteater exposed to prolonged temperatures above 90 Fahrenheit is at risk for heatstroke. If kept too cold (at temperatures below 65 degrees Fahrenheit), your pet anteater can become sick.</p><p>Outdoor enclosures must provide space forbothclimbing and exploring, as well as for protection. A hollowed-out tree stump or house, equipped with a heating element for cold nights, makes a safe haven for sleeping. If your anteater is invited indoors, secure your belongings and always supervise the animal for its own safety.</p><h2>What Do Anteaters Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Like most exotic pets, a proper diet is critical to the well-being of an anteater. Anteaters have acidic stomachs, high protein requirements, and no teeth. They need to eat a large volume of insects, almost 10,000 ants, and termites every single day such a volume is difficult to obtain in captivity.</p><p>Most zoos offer these mammals a high-protein insectivore powder mixed with water, insects, honey, and fruit. However, the bulk of a captive anteater's diet usually comes from a commercial feed (leaf-eater diet or cat food) used in different combinations of kibble or powder. You can even add in raw meat for a protein boost. But remember anteaters don't have teeth, so they must be fed only soft foods.</p><p>Allow your anteater to eat the ants it finds outside, then supplement with purchased ants as part of an enrichment opportunity. Place the ants on a small branch or in a container with dirt or rocks to promote exercise and ingenuity. You can also offer old, rotted logs and stumps for your anteater to tear apart in search of termites; rotten logs are usually plentiful and free.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>You may have a difficult time finding an exotics vet that is able and willing to care for your anteater, but it's vital that you locate one. Anteaters are prone to respiratory diseases, especially when their environment is too drafty or cold. Lack of humidity may also cause foot problems such as dangerously dry skin and cracked paw pads. Organ failure can also occur with inappropriate or insufficient diets, which can be detected by an annual blood screening from a competent vet.</p><h2>House Training </h2><p>Anteaters are difficult to potty train, so be prepared for the constant scent of foul-smelling urine when housing one indoors. Some owners claim to have success training their anteaters to use pee pads. However, anteaters like to mark their territory especially their bedding areas effectively making training a moot point.</p><p>Defecation usually occurs while they are climbing trees,so make sure tree limbs don't overhang anything of importance. Although pee pads placed throughout the house in the anteater's enclosure and under branches is the best way to keep the messes contained, accidents will occur and will require immediate cleaning, but often to no avail. Because the smell is so pungent and made to last, cleaning products are insufficient for the task.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Anteater </h2><p>Ranging in cost between $3,500 and $8,000, a pet anteater is suitable only for those with a robust budget. Building an enclosure and providing long-term care will more than double your purchase amount. The price of this unique mammal and the fact that they aren't readily available deters most exotic pet enthusiasts. Remember that anteaters need very special requirements. So if a pet anteater sounds like a budget-breaker for you, why not sponsor this endangered species instead? For a mere $25, you can help protect one of the world's most valuable species in the wild.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Anteater </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out otherexotic animalsthat can be a pet.</p><p>Yes. Anteaters are extremely difficult to care for, a fact that deters everyone but the most dedicated exotic animal enthusiasts.</p><p>Yes due to their unique environment needs and insatiable appetites, anteaters fair much better in their natural habitat than in captivity.</p><p>In the wild, anteaters can live up to 14 years however, in captivity, they only live around 7 years.</p>",1181
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/wallaroos-as-pets-1239572,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Should You Keep a Wallaroo as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Wallaroo as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Wallaroos, like kangaroos and wallabies, are Australian marsupials that raise their young in furry pouches on their bellies. Pet wallaroos are rare in the United States because most states ban their ownership. Caring for a wallaroo is challenging, at best, as this active jumper is ill-suited to life in a human environment. Not only will a pet wallaroo damage property by leaping onto furnishings and digging holes, but it can also hurt itself among such unnatural surroundings. Wallaroos can never be kept with cats because of the risk of contracting toxoplasmosis from feline feces.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Common wallaroo, wallaroo, grey wallaroo, red wallaroo</p><p>Scientific Names: (grey wallaroo) and (red wallaroo)</p><p>Adult Size: 32 to 58 inches</p><p>Lifespan:15 to 20 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Wallaroo? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Laws regarding exotic pets such as the wallaroo vary from state to state and even from county to county. Wallaroos are illegal in most states, but wallaroos, wallabies, and kangaroos are legal in Colorado. You may need a permit or license for importing, exporting, or keeping the wallaroo in your state. Before getting one, check your local laws as they change frequently.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>The wallaroo is a fascinating and potentially amicable animal, but it is not well suited to life in a human home, so owning one is considered unethical even if it is legal to own one in your state.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Wallaroos are extremely curious and active animals that naturally jump to travel around, explore, and get sufficient exercise. Trying to confine one in a house or typical backyard is distressing to the animal and may result in significant property damage.</p><h2>Wallaroo Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Wallaroos are shy, and it takes time to teach them to socialize. However, they are curious and will bond quite nicely with their owners if well-raised (while still nursing), socialized, and treated positively. Of course, taking a baby from its mother while it is still nursing can be traumatic and is considered cruel by many people.</p><p>Wallaroos can be destructive if left unsupervised. They are very active animals and get bored easily, leading them to break things or dig holes to keep busy.</p><p>Wallaroos can get along with dogs if introduced slowly and carefully. Cats should never come in contact with wallaroos as they can spread the deadly toxoplasmosis parasite to them. If your wallaroo comes across cat waste that's infected, it can quickly become infected and die.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>This marsupial hails from the wilds of Australia. If you live in an apartment, a wallaroo may not be the right pet, since this animal needs a lot of space. It is also a jumper, so it will need a large yard,pen, or pasture that is secure and fenced for adequate exercise. A wallaroo needs at least 2,000 square feet of space and a fence that's at least 6 feet tall (which will also keep out unwelcome predatory animals).</p><p>A wallaroo needs a shed, dog house, or shelter with hay or straw bedding and access to food. Wallaroos are hardy creatures that can adapt to cold weather. But if you experience extreme winters, and the temperatures drop lower than freezing inside the shelter, provide a heating lamp.</p><p>If you're considering keeping a wallaroo in the house, these animals won't use a litter box, so you'll need diapers, and fitting them can be a challenge. You'll also need to remove any fragile or breakable objects. Having a wallaroo in the house is a dangerous undertaking for both the animal and your home. Its hefty size, insatiable curiosity, and penchant for jumping make it unsuitable for most pet owners.</p><h2>What do Wallaroos Eat and Drink </h2><p>Wallaroos are herbivores that graze on grasses and shrubs in their natural environment. In captivity, give them a constant supply of fresh, good-quality hay (such as Bermuda, alfalfa, or ryegrass).</p><p>Ideally, provide a securely fenced grass pasture for them to graze upon. You can also feed wallaroos a commercial kangaroo or a wallaby diet (for example, Mazuri). Offer a variety of fresh vegetables as treats. Vitamin E and selenium supplements are also recommended. You can put their food in a larger hopper. As grazers, they'll only eat when hungry, not opportunistically.</p><p>They will need fresh water daily. Place it in the shade and off the ground to prevent defecation in the water. The water trough should have enough room to let the wallaroo put its forelegs in it to cool down.</p><p>If you get a baby wallaroo, you'll need to bottle feed it with a specialized formula (Wombaroo, Biolac, or Di-Vetelact). They will need to feed every few hours until they can eat on their own (about 8 months old).</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Wallaroos are subject to many of the same diseases experienced by other medium-sized mammals, including viral and bacterial infections, injuries, and cancers. Of special note is the danger of toxoplasmosis, a common pathogen in domestic cats. This disease is not always fatal to cats but can easily kill a wallaroo. Vaccines can help prevent illness, and regular visits to an exotic animal veterinarian may help find health issues in their early stages.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Wallaroos need a lot of exercise which includes jumping to keep their strong legs and tails in shape. Exercise also helps these animals stay healthy and happy in captivity. The key to making sure a wallaroo gets enough exercise is space-lots of it-where the animal can move around and jump freely.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Males can be close to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 100 pounds, while females are close to 3 feet tall and rarely get larger than 50 pounds.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Wallaroo as a Pet </h2><p>Besides being cute and entertaining to watch, there are few reasons to own a wallaroo. For the average person, keeping a wallaroo would be fraught with annoyance and possibly peril, as these curious animals always seem to be looking for trouble, making messes, destroying property, and jumping. Fortunately, for wallaroos' sake and people's, they are illegal to own in most of the U.S.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Pet Wallaroo </h2><p>There are only a few breeders in the United States that raise wallaroos. Visit a breeder to find your pet. Spend some time with your potential pet before you bring it home. Look for animals that are active, bright-eyed, and curious. Its coat should be shiny. Be sure the wallaroo you're considering is not afraid of humans. Adopt a wallaroo when it's as young as possible to increase the likelihood that it will bond well with you and your family.</p><p>Wallaroos are costly to buy and care for. Expect to pay between $1,000 and $4,000 for the wallaroo, plus you will need to fence in its entire enclosure. The average food costs are about $200 to $400 per month.</p>",1163
62,https://www.thesprucepets.com/stick-insects-as-pets-1236887,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep Stick Insect as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep Stick Insect as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Stick insects are among the most popular insects kept as pets,mainly due to their unique stick-like appearance and relative ease of care. There are over 2,500 species of stick and leaf insects; however, Indian stick insects are the most commonly kept as pets. Stick insects require the utmost care when handling, but they can be very tame and sit on your hand. They don't require daily maintenance and can be left alone for a week without any care. The key to keeping stick insects in captivity is mimicking their natural conditions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAME:Stick insect, Indian stick insect, Indian walking stick, laboratory stick insect</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</p><p>ADULT SIZE:4 to 5 inches</p><p>LIFESPAN:1 year, although they can live longer in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Stick Insect? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>A permit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture is required to import them. Check your local and state laws before getting any kind of stick or leaf insect as a pet.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>As long as you give your stick insect what it needs, there are no ethical issues with owning one.</p><h2>Stick Insect Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Stick insects are tame but extremely delicate. Exercise caution when handling them. Very carefully grasp them by the body (not the legs) between your thumb and forefinger and place them on your open palm or offer your open palm and gently nudge them onto your hand. They do not attack or bite people.</p><p>Stick insects are naturally nocturnal and will be most active at night. During the day, they remain still unless they are disturbed.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>As a rule, stick insects need an enclosure that is three times as tall as the length of the insect. For Indian stick insects, this means a cage a minimum of 15 inches tall, although a little higher would be better. Glass tanks (10 to 15 gallons), tall glass jars, plastic pet containers, and other similar containers work well for housing. Make sure the lid is well-ventilated and secure to prevent escapes. You can use fine netting, firmly fixed, to the top.</p><p>Indian stick insects should be kept fairly warm, around 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature can be allowed to decrease to the mid-60s Fahrenheit. The best way to achieve the proper temperature is to keep them in a warm room. However, provide supplementary heat through heating pads meant for reptile enclosures or by placing a lamp near the cage. Heating lamps tend to be very drying, and white bulbs should not be used at night. If you are using heating lamps, they require red or blue colored bulbs suitable for nocturnal animals at night.</p><p>If using potted plants in the pet's home, consider using a fluorescent fixture for optimal plant growth. Stick insects need a moderate level of humidity (75%), and the habitat should be well ventilated to prevent mold and fungus growth. The fungus can kill stick insects.</p><p>Cover the floor of the tank with paper for easy cleanup. A substrate of peat moss or vermiculite may also help maintain humidity, but it requires more effort to keep clean. Make sure it is not kept too moist. Stick insects produce a dry waste, which is easy to clean up.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Since this is where your stick insect lays its eggs, substrate is important. Desert sand works, as does potting soil or coconut fiber.</p><h2>What Does a Stick Insect Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Indian stick insects prefer oak, rose, and hawthorn leaves.Bramble (blackberry) is a favorite among other types of stick insects. Other options include privet and ivy.</p><p>Fresh cut branches of these plants can be placed in water in the cage and changed once they dry out (or are consumed). The water container for the branches must be closed off or sealed so that the insects do not fall into the water and drown. You can choose a narrow-necked jar and place some material around the plant stems to seal off the opening. An alternative to feeding cut branches is to grow small potted plants of the desired species and place them in the cage. They can also eat organic lettuce, which should be washed and cleaned well.</p><p>Misting the leaves of the plant will provide water for the insects to drink and help maintain humidity levels.</p><p>All food offerings must be free of insecticides and herbicides, or they may be lethal to your pets. Avoid collecting leaves and branches near busy roadways. If using potted plants, make sure that the soil used is free of pesticides. Some soils have pesticides, which may make their way into plants grown in that soil.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>There are no significant diseases that impact stick insects. They do hang upside down to shed their skin and require a large vertical space to do so. If the space they have is limited, the stick insect can die or become severely deformed. Pesticide exposure or fungal infection can also kill them.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Like praying mantises, stick insects molt several times before reaching adulthood (about 5 months). Molting is an extremely vulnerable time in development, and the insects should be left alone and not handled until the new exoskeleton hardens after a molt.</p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>Stick Insects require no bathing or grooming.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Stick insects grow to be about 4 to 5 inches long.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Stick Bug as a Pet </h2><p>Stick insects are easy pets. They're friendly and will sit on your hands, but be careful: it's easy to hurt a stick insect while you're holding or moving it.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Stick Bug </h2><p>Generally, you can find stick insects for sale online through reptile supply vendors. It costs about $20 to $50 for a supply of 50. They are challenging to find for sale in most pet stores since they are considered pests by many states.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Indian stick insects can reproduce in the absence of a male (parthenogenetic reproduction). A female will lay hundreds of tiny eggs over her lifespan. The smooth, round eggs can be collected and hatched in a warm tub of sand or vermiculite. Gestation may take up to 1 year. Upon hatching and until they reach adulthood, they should be kept in small, separate rearing containers and fed the same types of leaves as adults.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Stick Insect </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out other exotic pets that might interest you.</p><p>It will hang upside down in its enclosure as it molts.</p><p>It's not smart: stick bugs reproduce at a rapid rate, and before long you'll have far too many babies to care for. (And since stick bugs can be unfriendly to the environment, putting this collection of babies in the wild is a very bad idea.)</p><p>Yes! They can mimic the colors in their surroundings!</p>",1111

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the giant African Snail is a threat to both agriculture as well as human health, so owning one illegally is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. If the snail or its eggs were released in the wild, potential damage could include disease transmission and crop destruction.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture strongly discourages people from keeping giant African snails as pets because of the environmental and health risks they pose. If you find one of these snails, it is recommended that you contact your local fish and game department or the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).</p><h2>Giant African Land Snail Behavior and Temperament </h2><h3>Warning</h3><p>You should always wear gloves when handling giant African snails because they carry potentially dangerous microorganisms in their slime, including a parasite that can cause a form of meningitis that is harmful to humans. Always wash your hands thoroughly after handling a snail of any kind.</p><p>These huge snails are relentless omnivores and will eat everything they can. Fortunately, they're not carnivores. They are, however, extremely resilient, which is why efforts to eradicate them have proven difficult.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Giant African land snails can live in a glass or plastic 5-gallon tank with a secure, ventilated top. The tank should be placed in an area of indirect sunlight.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Line the bottom of the tank with soil or compost with some leaves or moss to help retain moisture. Use a spray bottle to keep the substrate moist.</p><h2>What Do Giant African Land Snails Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Giant African land snails eat nearly constantly in the wild; they have voracious appetites.</p><p>In the U.S., the snail will happily eat at least 500 types of plants, including fruits and vegetables, ornamental plants, and tree bark.
