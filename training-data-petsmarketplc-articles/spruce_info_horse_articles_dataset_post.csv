Lunging is a useful exercise for both horse and handler. It is a way to let your horse safely burn off extra energy without you riding it and can help when teaching horse obedience.</p><p>When done correctly, lunging can help a horse learn to be more flexible and balanced, as well as increase fitness if the horse has not been working. You can also use it to observe a horse's gaits to see if it is lame. And, lunging can be done to help a rider learn skills without having to worry about controlling the horse.</p><h2>Get Prepared </h2><p>Before you try to lunge your horse, make sure you have everything you need. A lunge line is essential and should be about 30 to 35 feet long. Flat webbing is preferable to rope because it's lighter and easier to handle. You will also need a lunge whip and lunging cavesson or sturdy halter (some people find the cavessons too cumbersome).Exercise boots or wraps help protect your horse's legs.</p><p>Additionally, you will want to lunge your horse in a ring, arena, or round pen. It's important to prevent as many distractions as possible, especially when just starting.</p><p>Gear for yourself will also help out considerably. Sturdy boots or shoes are essential so you don't trip or slide. Gloves can help prevent rope burn if your horse pulls, and it's not a bad idea to wear your helmet just in case. Finally, get your voice ready because it will be the primary aid you will use to cue your horse.</p><h2>Halter the Horse </h2><p>To lunge your horse, it should be outfitted with a lunging cavesson or a sturdy halter. A cavesson is not a necessity and many horses are trained to lunge without one. Do not lunge with the lunge line attached to a bit or hackamore.</p><h2>Enter the Ring </h2><p>Lead your horse to the ring or arena. Place your horse where you want it to travel, and walk to the center of the circle you want your horse to work on.</p><h2>Hold the Lunge Line and Whip </h2><p>If your horse will be working to the left, hold the lunge line in your left hand and your lunge whip in your right. When your horse is traveling in a circle to the right, the lunge line will be held in the right hand and the whip in your left.</p><p>Hold the line and the whip so that they are the sides of a triangle and you are the apex of the triangle. Your horse will be the base of the triangle. Both of your arms should be bent at the elbow and you should be standing relaxed.</p><h2>Walk the Horse </h2><p>Ask your horse to ""walk."" It's important to help your horse understand your voice aids by using the same tone and inflection each time for each cue. Most people use a low drawn-out """"for halt and sharp energetic words for walk, trot, and canter.</p><h2>Maintain the Circle </h2><p>As your horse moves off on the circle, you will be holding the lunge line up not dragging on the ground. Keep elbows bent and the whip pointed at the horse's hocks. Remember to maintain the triangle.</p><p>If you move at all, keep your circle very small. You may find yourself getting dizzy, so don't just spin in one spot.</p><h2>Upward and Downward Transitions </h2><p>Your voice aid for upward transitionswalk to trot or canter, or trot to cantercan be reinforced by the whip. For some horses it will only take a wave of the whip, others may need the lash to be popped. This is done by flicking the whip sharplyyou may need to practice perfecting this before you try lunging.</p><p>For downward transitionstrot to walk, walk to halt, canter to walk, or trot to haltmany people lower the tip of the whip to the ground. At no time does the whip ever touch the horse.</p><h2>Halt the Horse </h2><p>When you ask your horse to halt, it should stay out on the circle and wait for you to approach. Some people like the horse to come to them when called. If you do this, gather the lunge line up so it doesn't drag on the ground as the horse approaches.</p><h2>Halt and Change Direction </h2><p>Ask your horse to change direction: ask it to halt, step backward, and turn. Then change your whip and line hands and send the horse off in the opposite direction. This will take some practice for you to become coordinated in the movement and your horse to understand what you are asking. Very soon, you will not have to ask the horse to halt but be able to change direction in one fluid motion at a walk or trot.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behaviors </h2><p>Many people lunge their horses to burn off energy and provide exercise. Be careful that you don't make your horse fitter than you are. That will lead to it taking longer for your horse to level out.</p><p>Lunging isn't just about firing around in a circle or simply letting a horse run in circles around you. Doing either of these can lead to poor obedience and injury. The horse should be as obedient on the lunge line as it is when being led. Not only should lunging be physical exercise but mental exercise as well.</p><p>Most importantly, lunging is not a form of punishment.Punishing a horse is never a good idea and will only lead to a horse that acts out. Instead, you want to develop a bond with your horse and get them to trust people. Lunging is a fantastic way to do that.</p><p>The faster your horse is going, the larger the circle needs to be. You can do this by letting out more line. Lunging on a small circle can be very hard on a horse's legs, so increase the work gradually for the horse to become supple, fit, and balanced without strain.</p>",992
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-do-horses-kick-1887278,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>Why Horses Kick and What to Do About It</h1>,"<h1>Why Horses Kick and What to Do About It</h1><p>A horse that kicks can be dangerous. Even if your horse is merely kicking at a biting fly, and you happen to get in the way, you can be hurt. Some horses develop a bad habit of kicking and can be a menace on the ground, or while being ridden or driven.</p><h2>Why Horses Kick </h2><p>Horses kick for a number of reasons. As mentioned above, a horse may kick at biting flies around its legs and belly. A horse will kick at its belly if it has colic. They may kick or stamp if something like a prickly weed tickles their legs or belly. Usually, these aren't really powerful kicksafter all, if the intent was to get rid of the discomfort, they could further hurt themselves.</p><p>Horses are often seen kicking at each other in the pasture.When playing, these won't be powerful kicks, and they'll rarely connect with another horse. This can simply be a display of high spirits, often seen as the horse gallops and bucks to burn off energy.</p><h2>Defense </h2><p>Horses also kick to defend themselves, and these kicks are often powerful and well aimed. Horses may defend themselves by kicking when they feel another horse is getting too close to its food, its foal, a special herd mate, or if another horse is acting aggressively towards it. In the wild, horses use powerful kicks, often with both back legs at the same time, to ward off predators. A mare may kick at a stallionifit is not receptive to being bred.</p><p>This defensive instinct may explain why some horses kick when they become alarmedsuch as when a person, dog, or another animal 'pops into view' behind the horse. Or if a piece of equipment comes loose and drags behind or alongside the horse, it may react by kicking at it. A horse being trained to pull, may kick at the equipage, unless it is introduced to it slowly, and allowed to get used to the sight and noise of a horse-drawn vehicle.</p><h2>When Kicking Becomes a Problem </h2><p>Kicking while being handled, ridden, or driven can become a dangerous habit or vice. Somewhere along the line, the horse has learned that kicking is the best strategy to rid itself of something it dislikes. It then becomes a habit that the rider, handler, or driver must always keep in mind. Some horses get antsy when another horse is ridden too close behind and may kick to warn the other horse away. This causes a problem when the horse is being ridden in a group, or in a crowded area like a horse show. Both the horse and the rider (and spectators) are then in danger of being injured. I do know of incidents in which a horse has kicked at another, and the rider has taken the brunt of the blow.</p><p>Some horses dislike dogs, cats, or ponies and will offer to kick them anytime they get too close. Horses that have been hurt while being saddled up or having the girth/cinch done up quickly, will often 'cow-kick' in anticipation of being pinched. My daughter's nose was broken in one such incident. As she bent to reach under the horse to do the girth up, the young horse reacted by cow kicking, catching her in the face.</p><p>Some horses will kick out in defiance. This is a show of disrespect. These kicks are aimed towards you, but the horse knows it isn't within range to connect. This often happens while lunging or working in a round pen. Some horses kick the walls of their stalls when they are bored or impatient.</p><h2>How to Deal with a Problem Kicker </h2><p>If your horse seems to be a habitual kicker, there are a few things you can do. If you're out, tie a red ribbon on its tail to warn other people that the horse is known to kick. If you're riding in a group, ride at the back of the pack, and make sure others know of its habit. Teach your horse to respond to leg aids. A horse that is moving forward is less likely to kick. In a situation where another horse comes too close behind, you will be able to swing your horse's hindquarters to one side or another so your horse, even if it does kick out, can't hit its target.</p><p>Handling a horse that kicks takes extra caution. Any time your horse is in public, it should be wearing a red ribbon. Anyone who must work around the horse should be aware of the horse's habit. You and anyone else that must come near your horse must stay out of range of those hind legs. If you're in a public place like a horse show or fair, you need to position your horse away from foot traffic and other horses.</p><h2>Learn to Watch Body Language </h2><p>Most horses will warn you with their body language before lashing out. So, in addition to knowing what situations may trigger a kick, you need to understand its ear, head, and body posturing that may occur before a kick. Whether the horse is aiming its blow carefully or being defiant, you need to recognize the signs of an impending kick and give the horse something else to think about.</p><p>You may be able to lessen the vice by desensitizing the horse. If it seems to be scared and kicks out at a specific thing, you'll need to work gradually to get the horse accustomed to that thing. If it cow-kicks while being saddled, you need to be consistently gentle and slow about the process. If the horse habitually kicks at others in the pasture, it may need to be separated if it's causing the others injury.</p>",953
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-horses-chew-wood-1887279,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Stop Wood Chewing in Horses</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Wood Chewing in Horses</h1><h2>It's not good for the horse or the wood</h2><p>Horses are highly intelligent animals naturally inclined to be outside in large areas, and as such, when confined too long may develop bad habits out of boredom or frustration. A common habit that horses develop to ease their boredom and frustration is chewing on their wood stalls or other wood in their enclosures.</p><p>Not only does chewing damage the wood, but it can also create problems for the horse such as causing undue wear on the incisors and the chance of splinters being lodged in the mouth or swallowed.</p><p>There are some medical issues, such as vitamin deficiencies, that may compel a horse to chew wood. But most of the time a horse that's chewing on wood is a bored horse.</p><h2>Why Do Horses Chew Wood? </h2><p>There are a few reasons why horses chew wood. It's worth noting that wood chewing is not typically observed among wild horses, so this is a behavior that typically results from keeping a horse in an unnatural environment.</p><h2>Boredom </h2><p>Horses kept in stalls or paddocks, secluded from other horses, or fed mostly concentrates without enough fodder to keep them chewing over a long period of time may become bored and chew fences for something to do.</p><h2>Nutritional Deficiencies </h2><p>Occasionally, vitamin deficiencies may cause a horse to develop a taste for eating non-edible substances in an effort to alleviate the deficiency. This is not as common, but pica may indicate a serious underlying nutritional or hormonal problem.</p><h2>Habit </h2><p>Some horses may have learned to gnaw wood from stable or pasture mates. Like mischievous kids, they try what the other kids are trying, even if they would never have thought of it on their ownand the habit sticks. This is a bit of a trickier situation when it comes time to train the horse out of the wood-chewing behavior, because you may need to involve more than one horse in your efforts.</p><h2>Cribbing </h2><p>Horses that crib can be hard on wood (and other surfaces) too. However, this isn't truly wood chewing.</p><p>Cribbing formally referred to as , is an obsessive-compulsive disorder (again, found only in domesticated horses), where the horse sinks its incisors into an upright object like a fence post, then pulls against the object while inhaling and arching its neck. The horse isn't really chewing on the wood since it doesn't break off or swallow any pieces; it's more like leaning on the surface in order to forcibly gulp air.</p><h2>How to Stop Wood Chewing </h2><p>Once your veterinarian has ruled out any medical or nutritional issues, you can start addressing the behavior that's causing your horse to chew wood.</p><h2>Keep Your Horse Outdoors </h2><p>Horses that are kept indoors are more likely to develop habits to try to alleviate their boredom and frustration. Outdoors, some horses may get bored because there may be little to do once they eat all their hay. Horses in the wild spend the majority of their time grazing.</p><p>Allowing horses to live as naturally with other horses as possible, outdoors with plenty of grass or hay to nibble on, can help prevent wood chewing. But there are times when outdoor turnout isn't possible, such as when a horse has an injury requiring stall rest, if there isn't space or resources for all-day turnout, or conditions such as icy pastures make it dangerous for horses to be out.</p><h2>Treat or Protect Wood Surfaces </h2><p>Applying sprays, pastes, or washes that have a bitter taste painted onto the wood surfaces may be an option. The downside of such products is that they get washed off in the rain, and some horses don't seem to notice the taste. Additionally, make sure what you are applying to the wood is non-toxic.</p><p>You can nail metal caps over fence rails and posts, protectively wrap trees, and use plastic mesh as well. A string of electric fencing along the top rail of a fence usually keeps determined chewers back, and you can try setting up little pens around trees to prevent your horse from getting close enough to chew.</p><h2>Socialize Your Horse </h2><p>Along with more outdoor activity, socializing your horse with other horses may help alleviate some of its boredom. But don't pair up two horses that both chew on wood, and take care that the wood chewer doesn't end up being a bad influence on its nonchewing stablemate.</p><h2>Give Your Horse a Toy </h2><p>You may also want to provide your horse with a toy to play with to direct its attention away from wood surfaces, such as a large rubber ball.</p><h2>Check Your Horse's Diet </h2><p>Discuss this with your veterinarian first, but there's some evidence that when the amount of grain in a horse's diet is reduced, the horse is less likely to chew wood or engage in cribbing. Also be sure to offer your horse as much roughage as possible, to satiate your horse's natural grazing instinct.</p><p>Finding the right solution to wood chewing can save you money as well as ensure your horse's good health.</p>",853
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-you-can-be-hurt-by-a-horse-1887397,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>The 8 Most Common Ways You Can Be Hurt By a Horse</h1>,"<h1>The 8 Most Common Ways You Can Be Hurt By a Horse</h1><p>Many horse owners have never been seriously hurt by their horse. There's certainly no reason to be afraid of horses. However, when you are working with an animal that is large and reactive, you need to understand the common behaviors of this animal and learn how to safely work with and around it. If you take care and learn to understand horses, you can reduce the risk of injury greatly. The Canadian Hospitals Injuries Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) states that 49.6% of horse-related injuries required either 'advice or minor treatment'. Here's a list of common injuries that could occur as you work with or ride your horse.</p><h2>Being Stepped On </h2><p>Getting your toes crunched because you didn't move out of the way quickly enough is common. Even experienced horse owners occasionally don't move their feet as fast as their horses move theirs. This can lead to bruising, abrasions, and even fractured bones. It is possible to have your fingers stepped on, say when cleaning hooves, but far less likely. After a fall, it's possible that the horse might step on you, but often your horse will do what it can to avoid you.</p><h2>Kicks and Strikes</h2><p>Horses can strike out with their front or rear hooves, and they can strike out backwardand forwards with both. Sometimes, kicks are accidental, such as when a horse kicks at a fly and the handler gets in the way. Some kicks are intentional. Getting kicked by another horse while riding is also a risk, so be sure to keep a safe distance between horses when riding in a group.</p><h2>Falls</h2><p>According to the CHIRPP, 62% of reported horse-related injuries occurred due to falls. When you fall, almost any part of your body can be injured. Breaks or strains to arms, wrists and collar bones are common when riders try to break their fall by putting their arms out, as the rider in this photo is doing. The horse can also end up getting hurt.</p><p>Riders have been badly injured when a horse steps onor falls on them. And of course, the leading cause of death in riders is head injury. You can learn how to fall.But thatdoesn't mean you'll be able to avoidall harm.While a helmet won't guarantee 100% protection, statistics show that they do decrease the risk of traumatic brain injuries greatly.</p><h2>Bites</h2><p>Horses bite to defend themselves or to express irritation and impatience. Some are sneakyand disrespectful. Horses that get pushy about being fed treats can become demanding and bite fingers and arms. Horses can bite hard enough to break fingers and can cause severe bruising and cuts.</p><h2>Getting Knocked Over </h2><p>Getting knocked over by a horse is possible while it is loose, tied or being led. The more you work around a horse, the less likely this becomes, as you learn to anticipate what your horse is thinking and will do next. Getting knocked over can lead to sprains, bruises, and broken bones and teeth. </p><h2>Strains and Sprains </h2><p>When you first learn to ride you will be waking up a few sore muscles, some of which aren't really used in other sports or activities. Many people will feel soreness in the muscles along the inside of their upper thigh. Others may feel their calf muscles, either along the outside or at the back, tired after a ride. Backaches are common and can indicate a poorly fitting saddle, or poor riding position. Shoulders can also become tight. The good news is, as you strengthen and stretch these muscles, and learn to ride better, most of these pains will go away.</p><p>However, there are other strains that can happen by accident. A lot of things can happen as you fall including, straining or spraining joints and muscles either on the way down or as you land. If your horse suddenly spooks as you are leading it, your arm or shoulder muscles may get pulled. Sudden overexertionsuch as lifting your saddle, a bale of hay or carting a load of manure incorrectly, can also cause muscle strain.</p><h2>Being Dragged </h2><p>Being dragged from the ground, or getting dragged after a fall can result in injury. Even a relatively small pony can drag an adult around, causing muscle strain and abrasions if you lose your footing. Of course, whether you're dragged while handling or hung up in the tack, there is a danger of being kicked while you're down there. Getting caught in the stirrups can lead to very severe injuries if the horse spooks, runs and kicks. Thankfully, being dragged can be largely avoided by learning to lead a horse properly and using safety stirrups and proper footwear.</p><h2>Riding Into Obstacles </h2><p>Trail riding often means you encounter low branches that can scratch, stab you and even sweep you off the saddle. In an arena, it's possible to be taken through low doors, or bump into walls or obstacles like jumps or barrels.</p>",817
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-deal-with-a-horse-pasture-bully-5649716,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Deal With a Horse Pasture Bully</h1>,"<h1>How to Deal With a Horse Pasture Bully</h1><p>Horses have personalities just like humans. They also establish social structures and hierarchies within their groups. Unfortunately, if horses are allowed out in a pasture or paddock together, conflict may occur.</p><p>Occasionally there may be a certain individual horse that acts like what we would consider a ""bully."" A herd or pasture bully can wreak havoc on the other horses with which it lives. In these situations, you may see injuries to the other horses in the pasture caused by biting, striking, or kicking. In extreme cases, horses may be chased into objects and through fences.</p><p>Another issue of concern is a bully horse that keeps their pasture mates from eating or drinking. Sometimes a more dominant horse will guard these resources and prevent the more submissive horses from accessing them.</p><h2>What Causes Conflict Between Horses? </h2><p>Sometimes herd bullies act on their own, and sometimes they have a partner (or partners) that joins in terrorizing the rest of the herd. Bullies can be mares or geldings, big or small, and may be any breed or age. They are difficult to deal with because you can't control what goes on in the<br/>pasture when you're not around.</p><p>Though it is easy to label a more dominant horse a bully, there is almost always a reason for the horse's behavior. The horse may feel frightened or even threatened by the other horses. Past trauma may be a factor as well.</p><p>Not feeling well or being in pain can also cause these types of behaviors. A horse in pain may be trying to keep the others away in fear of being hurt. All horses should be frequently examined by a veterinarian and any issues promptly treated.</p><p>Another common issue that results in bullying in a horse herd is boredom. Horses are intelligent and need mental stimulation. Crowded paddocks, nothing to graze, and pent-up energy can all contribute to bullying.</p><h2>What To Look Out For </h2><p>As mentioned earlier, horses in a herd will establish a hierarchy. There is often one horse that is the leader, a few that may find favor with the leader, and sometimes, one submissive soul that takes the brunt of any abuse handed out. This is the natural process of a horse herd hierarchy.</p><p>Because establishing a pecking order in the herd is a natural behavior for horses, there is little you can do to change the dynamics. Punishing horses for this behavior is not effective and should not be attempted. You are not able to be present all of the time with the herd, and the horses will not<br/>understand your correction. Determining a hierarchy is a natural process and has evolutionary purposes for a horse herd.</p><p>You can, however, be cognizant of the situation. The first step is to spend some time simply observing the horses from a distance to allow for natural interaction. Make notes of which horses seem to be dominant and which are more submissive.</p><h2>How to Prevent Pasture Bullying </h2><p>It is imperative to ensure your paddocks or pastures are not overcrowded. This is the number one most important factor in reducing pasture bullying incidents. There needs to be enough room for the dominant horse not to feel threatened and for the more submissive horses to be able to get away.</p><p>When feeding, make sure that you have a feeding station for each horse that is spaced well apart from all of the other stations. Each pasture or paddock should also have at least two water sources, spaced out from each other, if possible. These strategies will aid in reducing bullying in the herd.</p><p>If the bullying becomes injurious to other horses, you may have no other choice but to keep the bully separated. Not all horses will get along, and it may be advantageous to have multiple smaller and separate paddocks as opposed to one large pasture. If there are issues, you should always remove the more dominant horse first and then observe to see how the hierarchy adjusts.</p><p>Another strategy that may be helpful is to keep horses of similar ages and personalities together. For age, it is a good idea to pasture younger, more active horses together and older, more sedentary ones in another area. These groups will have more similar energy levels and also work out their hierarchies more easily. When considering personalities, you will need once again to observe the horses for a period of time to determine which horses will get along well with one another.</p><h2>Final Thoughts </h2><p>There are many reasons why bullying behavior may be seen in a herd of horses pastured together. Establishing a hierarchy is normal behavior for horses and cannot successfully be prevented. Identifying the underlying cause is the first step to dealing with horse bullying and can aid in<br/>protecting all of the horses in the group. </p>",795
5,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horse-wont-stand-still-for-mounting-1886401,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>When Your Horse Won't Stand Still for Mounting</h1>,"<h1>When Your Horse Won't Stand Still for Mounting</h1><p>While there are some basic and essential manners each horse should have while being handled, there are also a few that should be expected when under saddle. One of these '""good manners"" is standing still while the rider mounts. Many horses squirm, fuss, and sidle away when the rider attempts to get into the saddle. And even if they do stand for mounting, they move off immediately before the rider has time to settle into the saddle and organize the reins. Some horses back up rather than move forward.</p><p>The consequences of allowing this bad habit to continue range from annoying and inconvenient to dangerous, especially if the horse bolts away before the rider is secure. There are a few reasons why this happens, and as with most ""horse problems"", it's important to ask why before attempting to solve the problem. This will prevent you from making your horse more frustrated or uncomfortable and shorten the length of time you'll need to break this habit.</p><h2>Sore Backs </h2><p>Many problems under saddle can be caused by a sore back. The reasons for a sore back can be numerousfrom skin lesions to sore feet to dental problems, and it sometimes takes careful troubleshooting to find the source. It may not be obvious, but something like hoof or leg problems can make a horse travel differently, tensing muscles that can become sore and tired over time. An unfit horse may suffer temporary back pain until they are conditioned for their work. Poorly fitting saddles can cause back sorenesseither just while your mounting or the whole time you're riding. Sometimes horses need chiropractic adjustments that can alleviate back pain. Muscle strain that occurs while working or playing can cause back pain.</p><p>Test for back pain by exploring your horse's back with your fingertips, penetrating the muscles on both sides of the spine with your fingertips. Treat any skin conditions and wait until they're healed before starting to ride again. Sore muscles are stiff and sore. If the horse has been sore for a long time, it may even 'block-out' the pain and make the pain harder to discover. Your vet, an equine massage therapist, or a chiropractor can help you diagnose back pain. You can also consider riding bareback.</p><h2>Saddle Pads and Blankets </h2><p>Pads and blankets can cause problems if they've become dirty and lumpy, have burrs or grass haws embedded in them, or are pulled down tightly across the horse's withers. Make sure your pads or blankets are smooth and clean. Pull the pad or blanket up off of the horse's withers after you put the saddle on so it's not digging into the horse at the withers.</p><h2>Horse IsUnbalanced </h2><p>This is common with young horses and will resolve itself as the horse learns to balance a rider and gains fitness and coordination.</p><h2>Horse Is Pulled off Balance by Rider </h2><p>Any horse can be pulled off balance and squirm around to rebalance itself if the rider is awkward and heavy as they climb into the saddle. Learn to lift yourself into the saddle and perhaps use a mounting block to make the job easier for you and the horse.</p><h2>Rider Hits the Saddle Too Hard </h2><p>It's important to settle yourself gently into the saddle and not just flop down. Your horse may squirm in anticipation and emit an equine ""oof"" as you plunk into the saddle. Use a mounting block and lower yourself gently into the saddle once you're up there.</p><h2>Rider Inadvertently Kicks Horse </h2><p>If the rider isn't careful about putting their foot in the stirrup with the toe pointing either frontwards or backward, they may dig their toe into the horse's ribs on the way up. The horse may take this as a cue to move forward. Use a mounting block to make getting on easier.</p><h2>Rider Hangs on Reins </h2><p>Be sure you're not using your reins to anchor yourself as you mount. You should have contact on the horse's mouth, but the reins need to be loose enough that they're not cueing the horse to back up.</p><h2>Evading Work </h2><h2>Rider Laziness </h2><p>It's really easy to get into the habit of letting your horse walk off before you are truly organized in the saddle. If your horse moves off as soon as your backside is in the saddle, you'll be re-enforcing a bad habit. Be sure you ask your horse to halt and stand quietly while you settle yourself and prepare to ride. Be sure to do this each and every time your ride as it's very easy for both of you to slip back into the habit.</p>",764
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-horses-roll-1887340,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>Why Horses Roll</h1>,"<h1>Why Horses Roll</h1><h2>Identify if it's a natural behavior or a sign of a problem</h2><p>You might have driven past a field of horses and noticed one horse squirming around on the ground with its legs flailing in the air. Or, after you unsaddle your horse and turn it into its paddock, it might lie down and scrub its back and sides on the ground. In either case, what you are seeing is a natural behavior of horses called rolling. There are several reasons why horses roll.</p><h2>Natural, Healthy Horse Behavior </h2><p>After you ride your horse, it may get down in a sandy spot and have a good roll. This may relieve any irritation from sweat or tack, just as you might scratch after removing socks with elastics or pants with a snug waistband. Rolling may relieve any tight muscles or stress after being ridden. Horses will also roll to scratch themselves. If their skin itches from insect bites, residual shampoo or grooming products or from sweating in the sun or under a blanket, they will roll to stop the itch. Some people think that a roll in sand or mud provides some protection from sunburn and from biting insects.</p><p>It's a bit frustrating if after you give your horse good grooming or a bath, they find the closest patch of sand to roll in. But sometimes grooming and bathing can change how your horse's skin feels and rolling is its way of trying to get things back to normal.</p><h2>It's Contagious </h2><p>Often rolling will appear to be contagious. One horse will copy the behavior when they see another horse rolling. Rolling is a bit like the horse giving itself a massage. So, just because it feels good, one horse after another will share a sandy spot to roll in. It's not unusual to find a hollow bare circle in a field that is a favorite rolling spot.</p><h2>Shedding Hair </h2><p>In the spring, when horses are shedding their thick winter coats, rolling helps loosen the hair. Horses may be damp with sweat if the temperature suddenly soars up, and your horse will be sweating beneath its warm coat. So rolling helps to relieve the itchy sweaty feeling while removing some of that excess hair. Rolling may also help dry the horse's skin, which is why it will do it after a rain or bath.</p><h2>When Rolling Indicates a Problem </h2><p>Most of the time, rolling is perfectly okay, and natural, healthy horse behavior. But there are a few situations where rolling might indicate a problem.</p><p>You don't want your horse to try to roll while you are riding it. Horses attempt to roll while being ridden because they are uncomfortable, or rolling can be the horse's way of being balky, and resisting work. If your horse suddenly tries to roll while being ridden, carefully check your tack for anything that may be poking or pinching the horse. Your horse may also be experiencing muscle soreness while being ridden. Often, an equine chiropractor can help you sort out this sort of problem. And for horses that are balking, and using rolling to get out of work, some re-schooling with a rider who recognizes the signs that the horse may try to rollbefore the horse carries out the deed is in order.</p><h2>It Can Be a Symptom of Colic </h2><p>Rolling can also be a symptom of colic. You can identify a normal, healthy roll by noticing how the horse rolls, and how it acts when it gets on its feet. When your horse is rolling for the enjoyment of it, it may circle a few times, get down, roll, perhaps get up again and roll on the other side, regain its feet and then have a good shake to get the dust off. And healthy horses rarely try to roll in their stall.</p><p>When a horse is rolling because of colic, it will drop down, often suddenly, roll violently, and then stand listlessly afterward, with no invigorating shake to rid itself of dust. It may try to roll in its stall, and it may try to roll multiple times. A horse that has been rolling in its stall may appear disheveled, sweaty and covered in manure and shavings.</p><p>There's some debate whether rolling can cause twists in the gut that cause torsion colic. Some people feel that a twist has occurred before the horse starts to show colic symptoms, such as rolling. But, whether or not rolling causes twists, a horse with colic torsion should be prevented from rolling because it expends a lot of energy, and as it violently thrashes, it could hurt itself or the people handling it.</p>",766

While some riders regularly use neck reining, direct (or plow) reiningis a more basic way to turn.</p><p>Direct reining means you hold one rein in each hand. Your left-hand cues for a left turn and your right hand uses the right rein to cue for a right turn.</p><p>As you progress in your riding skills, you'll learn how to use the reins with more finesse, and to guide your horse more precisely. To start, learn how to cue your horse to do simple turns.</p><h2>Start Your Ride </h2><p>Use thin riding gloves to improve your grip on the reins. With your horse saddled and bridled, you'll want to work in a flat obstacle-free area at first, then add obstacles as your skills improve. Try riding in circles, serpentines, and loops to learn to use your hand, seat, and leg aidsand to keep your body in balance.</p><h2>Hold the Reins </h2><p>Hold one rein in each hand. Your hands will be an inch or two forward of the saddle and several inches above, so your fists are at a 30-degree angle. Your thumbs will be up, and the bight (buckle end) of the reinwill be coming up out of the top of your hand. Hold the left rein with your left hand and the right rein with your right hand.</p><h2>Cue the Horse to Walk Forward </h2><p>Keep a gentle elastic contact between the reign in your hands and the horse's mouth as you cue it to walk forward using your leg and seat. The reins shouldn't be taut or drooping. There should be a straight line from your elbow to the bit.</p><h2>Use the Reins to Turn Left </h2><p>To turn left, pull back with gentle pressure on the rein in your left hand. Squeeze back rather than tugging on the reins. As you actively cue with the left rein, continue contact on the right rein, as this controls the amount of bend your horse will take as he rounds a corner. The right rein, therefore, should neither be allowed to go slack nor held too tightly.</p><p>At the same time you cue with the reins, apply pressure with your left leg onto the horse's side so the horse is turning around your leg. Don't lean as you turn, but stay straight in the saddle, with your weight on your inside hip bone.</p><h2>Shift Pressure as the Horse Turns </h2><p>As the horse obeys the cue, release the pressure of your hand and leg. Keep a gentle contact with your horse's mouth until the next time you ask it to stop or turn.</p><h2>Use the Reins to Turn Right </h2><p>To turn right, use the right hand and leg to cue the horse in the same manner. Your right rein will now be the active rein, and you want the horse to bend around your right leg.</p><h2>Mistakes to Avoid </h2><p>Use the minimum pressure on the bit required to cue the horse. Harsh pressure on the mouth can upset a horse and make it insensitive to your commands. Never pull or yank suddenly.</p><p>Avoid clenching too tightly with your legs. Not only will it make your legs and seat ache, but it may also confuse the horse. The more tightly clenched your leg muscles are, the tenser your entire body is. The horse will pick up on this tension and may react accordingly.</p><p>When you're in the saddle, your weight should fall to your heel, as your leg hangs naturally.</p><p>Reins constantly need readjusting as you ride. Always keep gentle contact on the horse's mouth by shortening or lengthening the reins according to the horse's gaits. This means shortening your reinsas you go faster, and lengthening as you slow up, to allow the horse's neckto move naturally.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Learning to use the reins and aids properly will take practice until it becomes completely automatic. Don't grip the reins too tightly, because this confuses the horse, and over time it may learn to ignore the rein aids, or worse, react to the discomfort by rearing or pulling back.</p><p>Many people think that the reins alone cue the horseto turn, but this isn't entirely true. Seat and legs also come into play. Use schoolingfigures and obstacles like rails and pylons to practice turning around with accuracy.</p>",721
8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/punishing-your-horse-1886394,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>Punishing Your Horse - What Does and Does Not Work</h1>,"<h1>Punishing Your Horse - What Does and Does Not Work</h1><h2>Why punishment rarely works</h2><p>When our horses don't behave the way we want them to, sometimes our first reaction is to become angry and mete out punishment. It is very difficult to make a horse connect the punishment with unwanted behavior. Horses don't think the way we do. Punishment is rarely an effective way to train. Here are the most common ways horses are punished, why they don't work, and how they might cause further problems.</p><h2>Hitting </h2><p>Hitting a horse with your hand, or any object is rarely an effective method of correction. The horse is unlikely to understand that you are punishing it for unwanted behavior and it may become fearful, or rebellious, depending on its nature. If your horse bites you, and you punish it by hitting, you may only create a craftier and quicker biter. If you hit your horse because it has moved sideways into you while grooming, you've missed an opportunity to teach it to move away from you with a more subtle cue even though you've solved the immediate problem.</p><h2>Hitting Around the Head </h2><p>A horse's head should be off limits to hitting, slapping, pinching or any other action that can cause fear or pain. To do so can cause a head shy horse and a horse that doesn't trust you. Haltering, bridling, administering medications, doctoring eyes, grooming and clipping will be much more difficult with a head shy horse. Any action that causes your horse to throw its head back is eliciting a fear response that will be a barrier to learning.</p><h2>Yanking on the Reins </h2><p>While you are riding, yanking or see-sawing on the reins will harm your horse's mouth and its trust in your rein aids. Pulling hard on the reins can cause the horse to learn to ignore the signals or start a habit of head tossing.</p><h2>Pulling Down on the Nose or Poll </h2><p>Whether your horse is wearing a bridle or halter, yanking downwards on the horse's nose or poll in a way that makes it throw its head and neck back is encouraging it to react with a fear response. And it is another way to make your horse head shy. This includes flicking a whip, lead rope, or waving the lead rope in a way that makes the horse throw its head back and perhaps even steps back.</p><h2>Solitary Confinement </h2><p>Tying a horse up, or leaving it confined in a stall to 'think about things' is ineffective, because your horse won't think about the behavior that led to it being confined. Your horse doesn't think like that. It will likely be thinking that it's hungry and would rather be outside with its pasture buddies.</p><h2>Restrictive Tying </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>Tying a horse with its head up or down in an unnatural position isn't a punishment or training method. The only thing accomplished will be to create a muscle sore horse and if it struggles to escape the discomfort, it can cause lasting physical damage. This can lead to other behavior problems. Likewise, tying a leg up and leaving it because the horse won't pick its feet up, tying the head around to force it to bend, or leaving a horse tied in any way to restrict its natural movement will lead to more problems, behavioral and physical.</p><h2>Chasing </h2><p>Chasing a horse to catch it is unlikely to work, unless you are in a small pen, and are able to have some control over the speed and direction the horse is going. Chasing a horse around a large field to simply exhaust it is ineffective. You might end up teaching it how to run away from you.</p><h2>Kicking </h2><p>Like hitting a horse, kicking to punish, either from the ground or from the saddle may cause more problems than it solves. From the ground, it has the same effect as hitting. From the saddle, your horse may overreact, or some horses will simply shut down as you drum your heels. Jabbing with spurs turned inwards or used in a way to cause pain is unacceptable.</p><h2>When to Punish Your Horse </h2><p>Punishment is a poor training method, and as Ron Meredith of Meredith Manor states, and there are three times you punish a horse for doing something wrongnever, never and never.</p>",708
9,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-teach-your-horse-or-pony-to-neck-rein-1886980,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>How To Teach Your Horse or Pony To Neck Rein</h1>,"<h1>How To Teach Your Horse or Pony To Neck Rein</h1><p>Being able to neck reinor steer your horse with one hand is a useful skill. Neck reining makes things like opening gates without dismounting, carrying something, or swishing away flies while trail riding easier. Neck reining is also a fun, safe, and easy thing you can teach your horse even if you are not an advanced rider.</p><h2>What You Need </h2><h2>Mount Up and Guide Your Horse Consistently </h2><p>Mount your horse, hold a rein in each hand as normal and start at a walk. If you are accustomed to riding on contact-always feeling tension on the reins, you will need to slacken your reins slightly. That way when you cue with the rein against the neck you are not accidentally pulling on the bit as well. You want the horse to lead into the turn with his nose, not tip his head to the outside.</p><p>Walk in a straight line, then turn a sharp corner of about a 90-degree angle. As you turn the corner cue with the inside rein, your seat and legs aids, as usual, but lay the outside rein against the horse's neck. Lift your hand, so the rein makes clear and positive contact against the mid-section of the neck.</p><p>As you come out of the turn return your hands to their normal direct reining position. Be careful not to pull on the outside rein that you are laying against the horse's neck as you may confuse him.</p><h2>Keep Sessions Short and Vary Cues </h2><p>Make many turns, frequently changing directions. Visualize how and where you want to make your turns each time you are on a straightway. Try doing this for about 15 minutes over several days. Several short sessions will be more effective than one long session. Don't follow the same pattern each time you ride as you might find your horse learns the pattern and ignores thereinaidsagainst his neck.</p><p>After a few sessions, try making the neck-rein cue first, before putting contact on the bit. Release any contact with the bit as soon as the horse starts into the turn, but leave the rein on the neck until you wish to discontinue the turn. If the horse wanders out of the turn, squeeze the inside rein slightly to remind him of the direction. Continue doing this for several more sessions.</p><h2>Hold the Reins in One Hand </h2><p>When your horse consistently responds to the neck rein cue, you will no longer need to cue with the inside rein. Hold the reins in one hand. It is traditional to neck-rein with your non-dominant hand. This leaves the dominant hand free to work a lasso or open a gate. However, if you won't be roping cattle, and encounter few gates, you can choose to use whichever hand you please</p><h2>Practice Patience </h2><p>Be patient with your horse, some are fast learners, and some take extra time to learn their lessons. Likewise, you are teaching yourself at the same time. Go slow and take things one step at a time. Once the neck rein cue has been learned, and you can turn smoothly you need only practice occasionally.</p><h2>Don't Forget Your Body Cues </h2><p>The inside rein guides the horse in the direction you want to go and is called the leading rein. The inside or leading rein on a left turn is the left rein, and on a right turn, the inside or leading rein is the right rein. Whether you are reining with one hand or two, your legs and body are an important part of the cue. Don't concentrate so hard on your hands, that you forget everything else.</p><h2>Work in an Area Where the Horse Feels Safe </h2><p>Your horse will likely be more attentive if you work in a fenced ring or an arena. Some horses hate being in a ring though. Work where ever you feel safe, and your horse will be most attentive.</p><h2>Ride With Intention </h2><p>If you are inclined to be vague or daydreamy, your horse will quickly pick up your inattentiveness and inconsistency and not take your commands seriously. You will want to work in rather sharp corners, rather than gradual or circular turns so that your horse knows you are making a definite turn rather than just vaguely wandering around.</p>",706
10,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horses-that-spook-or-shy-1886399,Horses > Horse Behavior & Training,<h1>Preventing Horse Spooking</h1>,"<h1>Preventing Horse Spooking</h1><p>Often a horse's natural reaction to something that it doesn't understand is to spook or shy. A spook is usually a startled jump sideways, or a quick change of direction with the intention to flee. The horse may or may not want to keep their eyes on the object that frightens them. In the wild, this quick reaction is a response that would allow a horse to flee a predator very quickly. Riding a spook can sometimes be funbut often it is annoying and even dangerous if you come unseated. A horse that spooks in hand can knock you or others down, which can be very dangerous. For a beginner, a spooky horse isn't the best choice as being surprised by the startled reaction and quick movement of the horse may be unsettling and confidence eroding. A violent spook may land you on the ground, and nobody enjoys falling off.</p><h2>Why Horses Spook </h2><p>It's almost impossible to avoid every spook, but some horses are more likely to be reactive than others. As a beginner, you'll probably be looking for a bombproof horse, one that has seen and done it all. However, that doesn't mean your horse will never spook or shy. The quietest of horse can still react to something that surprises it. In the wild, this quick reaction response was what kept horses from the jaws of predators. Even though horses have been domesticated for a few thousand years, they still retain this very natural tendency. Sometimes there are situations where you encounter something there's simply no way to prepare for.</p><p>While spooking is a natural reaction to being startled, some horses that are high energy will spook to burn off steam. A horse that is uncomfortable with a badly fitting saddle, too tight girth, or other physical pain such as chiropractic issues may be 'spooky' in response. Spooking may also be an indication of vision problems. Some horses are more insecure than others, and if they don't respect the handler or rider as a leader, they won't trust them to keep them away from unsafe situations.</p><h2>How Your Horse Should Behave </h2><p>Ideally, your horse will have a blasé attitude whenever you're riding or handling it, but the extreme opposite of this is the horse that seems to spook at every trembling leaf, change in light and shadow, a patch of daisies, or unexpected rock or tuft of weeds. This is very unnerving for the beginner rider and can make the spooking worse. Horses are emotional sponges, and if they sense the rider or handler is nervous, they will pick up the negative energy. Often horses that are relaxed when turned out in the ring or pasture will suddenly find things to be frightened of when they are ridden in those same places. This is because they are sensing the rider's worry and becoming worried about themselves. It turns into a vicious cycle as horse and rider each makes each other more insecure.</p><h2>Why Your Horses Good Behavior Goes Bad </h2><p>If your previously quiet horse has become progressively spookier, you first need to look at any possible physical problemschiropractic, painful tooth issues, saddle fit or vision problems. If you're feeling nervous, a good coach or instructor can help you work past confidence issues. If your horse is afraid of specific thingslike mailboxes, pots of flowers, or puddles of water, your coach can help you desensitize your horse. A beginner shouldn'ttry desensitizing a horse on their own because done incorrectly it is possible to make the problem worse.</p><p>The better schooled your horse is, the more you will be able to control his reactions when he spooks. By applying leg aids, you may prevent a spook from turning into a 180-degree spin. However, first, your horse has to be taught to respond to leg aids. This again is where good coaching can help you learn to have effective seat and leg aids. Many horses will spook in one direction.So, it's important not to zone out completely when you ride.The better rider you become, the less likely your horse will spook.</p><p>On the ground, your horse should always know to keep its distance. It should understand that it is never acceptable to initiate contact. Again, desensitizing exercises with a competent coach can help prevent spooks or shies on the ground or in the saddle.</p>",719
11,https://www.thesprucepets.com/before-breeding-your-mare-1885776,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>What to Know Before Breeding Your Mare</h1>,"<h1>What to Know Before Breeding Your Mare</h1><p>A broodmare is a female horse used for producingfoals. They often are chosen in hopes of passing down their outstanding physical or athletic attributes or desirable ancestry. Not all mares should be used as broodmares. But, if you have a mare there are a few things you should consider before breeding her.</p><p>Breeding a mare and raising a foal isn't just a matter of taking your horse to a stallion, waiting eleven months and then welcoming the newcomer. Along with the rewards of raising a foal, there are a lot of responsibilities and expenses, some risks, as well as a few things to consider before you even start shopping for the perfect stallion. Make sure you are aware of some of the things that are entailed in the process.</p><h2>Things to Consider Before You Breed Your Mare </h2><p>If you've had any exposure to the horse world, you may be aware of the fact that there are many unwanted horses languishing in foster homes, rescue farms and sadly, somewhere on a truck headed for slaughter. Right now, there are more horses than homes. There are a few different factors for this, but the bottom line is, you have to ask yourself, does the world need another horse?</p><p>Having your mare produce a foal sounds like a cheap way of getting another horse. Nothing could be further from the truth. Breeding to a quality stallion will cost several hundred to several thousand dollars. There are veterinarian costs before and after breeding. Many stud farms charge for mare care. If your mare doesn't 'catch' the first time around, you will pay for an extended stay and perhaps more vet costs such as hormone injections. While breeders do everything they can to ensure the safety of the mares during the breeding process, there is a small risk of injury, which of course could lead to more vet bills. Especially if you consider the cost of raising a young horse from birth to four years, for the same price, you could buy a fairly expensive well-trained horse.</p><h2>Responsible Breeding </h2><p>Each mare that is bred and every stallion used for breeding must be worth reproducing. Breeding poorly conformed mares to the un-gelded two-year-old next door is not a responsible way to produce foals. As Dr. Bob Wright, formerly of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, Veterinary Branch maintains, a mare and a stallion must earn the right to reproduce. This means that any broodmare musthave proven themselves as pleasure or performance horses, and have desirable traits, physically and mentally, that can be passed on to produce a quality foal.</p><h2>Breeding Isn't Cloning </h2><p>Many people, who love their mare, think that if they breed it, it will produce a foal just like itself. Again, this is another myth and there is no guarantee that a foal will have the same color, size, personality, conformation or other attributes you value in your mare. Choosing the right stallion will go a long way to ensuring you'll get what you want when the foal arrives, but there are absolutely no guarantees.</p><h2>Risks </h2><p>Carrying a foal and the birthing process does entail some risk to both mare and foal. Many things can go wrong during the time the mare is in foal, during the birth, and after the foal is born. Most of these problems can be solved by a timely call to the veterinarian. You will have to be well informed to recognize a problem before it advances and be willing to pay for more veterinary care. Looking after a sick mare or foal will require extra time as well.</p><h2>Broodmare Care During Pregnancy </h2><p>Seeing a mare through a pregnancy does take extra consideration. When she is about half-way through the gestation period she needs to be fed in a way that supports her own health and the growth and health of the foal. At this point too, you will need to lessen her workload if she is being ridden regularly. After about nine months, she should be ridden very lightly, and shortly before her foaling date, not at all. She needs to be checked by a veterinarian who will advise you on when certain vaccinations should be given. Early in the pregnancy, she should also be checked internally for twins, infection or other abnormalities.</p><p>If you don't already have a place for your mare to foal, she'll need a large stall, at least 12 by 12 feet, that is deeply bedded and safe for the foal. This means that the stall has been checked for safety hazards that a foal could get hung up in, or hurt on, and constructed in a way that is sturdy and safe. She also needs to be safe from other horses that might harass her or steal her feed.</p><p>As the foaling date arrives, the mare will need careful monitoring. You or someone else will need to be there for the birth if possible, or at least, very shortly thereafter. Most births proceed normally, but if there is a problem, someone needs to know how to recognize it, and call the veterinarian.</p><h2>Considerations Following Foaling </h2><p>After your mare has foaled, There are things that need to be checked and done. You need to be sure the foal is whole and healthy, and if anything looks awry, the vet should be called. The mare should be checked for signs of injury during the birth, to ensure the placenta has been expelled within about three hours and to make sure the foal is healthy. Foals too, need to be watched in the days following birth for signs of dehydration and infection from bacteria or viruses. In short, you need to be informed and prepared for any possible expense.</p><p>Once the foal is safely on the ground, it will take years of expense and training before it can be used. Many things can go wrong in the intervening time. Illness or injury can add to the basic costs of raising a foal. Foals must be handled too, so they require a commitment of time to ensure they are trained to be 'good citizens' with acceptable basic manners.</p><p>And, if anything happens to you, you need to think about what will happen to all of your horses, should you be unable to care for them. We think our lives won't change, but life does hand out bad deals sometimes and requires us to make a lifestyle change. We owe it to our horses to ensure they are healthy and well behaved so that if we can't own them, someone else will want to, and they won't end up at a rescue, or worse on a stock truck headed to a slaughter plant.</p>",1112
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/plants-toxic-to-horses-4121978,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>Plants Toxic to Horses</h1>,"<h1>Plants Toxic to Horses</h1><p>Happy / Pixabay</p><p>If you have horses and a garden, you'll have to be careful that you do not have certain plants on your property. These common weeds, trees, plants, and shrubs, shown below, are toxic to horses and ponies. Learn to identify these plants in your pastures and yards and be sure to remove them as soon as possible to keep your horses safe.</p><h2>Deadly Nightshade </h2><p>Deadly nightshade can thrive even in dry conditions. It yields a bell-shaped purple flower and the small, round fruit looks like a large black currant, of a deep, shiny black/purple color. All parts of this plant are toxic to humans and pets. The fruit is somewhat sweet, therefore adding to its danger.</p><p>The leaves are dark green and smooth-textured, somewhat similar to that of a tomato plant. It belongs to the same family as the tomato, potato, and pepper plants.</p><p>Typically horses accidentally may ingest a toxic plant because it has been baled into the hay.</p><h2>Buttercups </h2><p>The flowers are yellow and cup-shaped, and plants have sharply lobed leaves. The grass around buttercup plants may bewell grazed. If there is more desirable feed available, horses will generally avoid eating buttercups because of their acrid taste and tendency to blister the mouth. After a hard frost or if dried in hay, buttercups are no longer toxic.</p><h2>Bracken Fern </h2><p>Bracken fern is very common, as it can be found growing along roadsides, in fields, in light bushy areas, and even gardens. In the spring, 'fiddleheads' unfurl into triangular fronds. Bracken fern, dried and baled into hay, is still toxic. If a horse eats a large quantity of this fern, the toxins can cause a vitaminB1 deficiency.</p><h2>Horse Tails </h2><p>Soils comprised largely of sand and gravel drain quickly, making them perfect for this variety of horsetail. Other varieties grow in more marshy areas. The plant can be toxic whether dried and baled into hay, or consumed as the fresh plant. The toxin in this plant inactivates thiamin (vitamin B1) in the horse's gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2>Lamb's Quarters (or Pigweed) </h2><p>In some areas, this plant is called pigweed or goosefoot. The leaves can be broad with varying shapes, and are covered in a whitish coating. The stems are smooth, and can be green or have a reddish tinge. The 'flower' looks rather like a small pale green cauliflower cluster. It is a very common weed in gardens.</p><p>A horse would have to eat a large number of lamb's quarters for the toxin to take effect. Unless there is no other feed available, it is unlikely a horse will eat this plant.</p><h2>Lily of the Valley </h2><p>It's a lovely spring-blooming perennial bulb, but it's toxic to horses. Does this grow in your flower garden?</p><p>This common garden plant is toxic to humans and pets, including horses. Lily of the valley is unlikely to be growing in a pasture, as it is typically planted in house gardens because of its attractive flowers and pretty red berries. It could be accidentally ingested if someone were to throw garden clippings close to a fence line where curious horses might be able to reach. Garden and lawn clippings should be disposed of in an area that is out of the reach of horses.</p><p>The plant's toxins affect the heart.</p><h2>Milkweed </h2><p>Milkweed is a very common pasture plant. Elliptical shaped leaves branch off of a central stem. Within the plant is awhite, sticky sap. The flowers grow in a ball-shaped cluster and when in full bloom can range from a pink to purplish color. The pods develop to about 3"" and in fall, split open to release brown seeds that float through the air on downy white fluffy fibers. All parts of the plant are toxic. Green, fresh plant material and dried plants (accidentally baled into hay) are toxic. Like most toxic plants, horses will avoid milkweed unless they have no other food source.</p><p>Milkweed is the host plant for the important pollinator, the monarch butterfly. So, although it should not be present in hay fields, safely planting this flower in beds away from grazing livestock is acceptable.</p><h2>Pigweed </h2><p>Pigweed can be very toxic if eaten in large quantities. Horses are unlikely to eat this plant unless there is no other food available. This weed seems to grow everywhere, from pastures to vegetable gardens, roadsides to barnyards. It is still toxic if dried and baled into hay. Pigweed and its relative, lamb's quarters,can cause kidney failure.</p><h2>Red Maple </h2><p>The bark of red maples is smooth and grayish. The twigs are reddish-brown.</p><p>The wilted and fallen leaves can be toxic to horses. The toxins destroy the red blood cells. Just 1.5 to 3 pounds of ingested red maple leaves can be lethal.</p><p>Leaves can remain toxic for several weeks after they've fallen. Don't dispose of red maple leaves in manure piles or compost heaps that might be within the reach of your horses. Red maple leaves can cause problems if baled into hay.</p><p>Red maples grow throughout the eastern United States and Canada.</p><h2>Red Oak </h2><p>Various varieties of oaks grow throughout North America. Horses will eat the leaves if there is no other food available. Water may be contaminated by fallen leaves. Acorns are also toxic if eaten in sufficient quantities.</p><h2>St. John's Wort </h2><p>St. John's Wort blooms from May to August and can tolerate most soil types, but prefers moist soil with good drainage. If you crush the flowers between your fingers, it will leave a rusty reddish stain. St. John's Wort causes photosensitivity when ingested by livestock. Animals may have blistered skin and white areas of the coat may be more prone to sunburn.</p>",947
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pregnancy-in-horses-1885935,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>Symptoms and Stages of Pregnancy in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Symptoms and Stages of Pregnancy in Horses</h1><p>Some basics of equine reproduction and horse pregnancy include mating, the gestation period, and foaling. A mare (or female horse) can typically produce one viable foal per year. A mare is capable of producing a foal at about 18 months of age, but it's healthier if the mare is at least 4 years old, as she will have reached her full size. A mare may continue to have foals until she is in her late 20s.</p><p>Although horses can mate and give birth without the attention of a veterinarian, many problems can be circumvented with a veterinarian's help. The doctor can check the stallion before breeding and check and care for the mare properly during the gestation period.</p><h2>Average Gestation Period </h2><p>The gestation period in horses is typically between 330 and 345 days, or 11 months. Some mares will be inclined to foal earlier or later than the average, and breeders will get to know these tendencies. In a natural environment, the stallion will breed the mare in the summer, and foals will be born the next year, in spring or early summer. This ensures that the foals are born when pasture is abundant and the weather is mild.</p><p>Mares are considered seasonally polyestrous, which means they go into heat (estrus) and are receptive to a stallion several times at regular periods during the spring and summer. These seasonal estrus cycles are approximately every three weeks. However, breeders who wish to manipulate the breeding cycle, so that foals are born earlier in the year (commonly done in the Thoroughbred racehorse industry) will use artificial lighting to simulate the longer days of spring and summer. The artificial daylight stimulates the mare's brain to produce the reproductive hormones needed to induce estrus. This allows mares to be bred earlier, and in turn have a foal earlier the following year.</p><h2>Checking For Pregnancy </h2><p>Beyond the absence of an estrus cycle, mares may not show any visible signs of pregnancy for the first three months. Pregnancy can be confirmed by ultrasound approximately two weeks after breeding. Blood and urine testing can be done two to three months after conception. Alternatively, a veterinarian may be able to manually feel the small embryo in the mare's uterus via rectal palpation. This can be done at approximately six weeks into the pregnancy and sometimes even earlier.</p><p>It's important to have the mare checked by a veterinarian early in the pregnancy to assess her health and the health of her foal. Horse twins are rare but can lead to spontaneous abortion. If the twin foals are carried to term, there is a possibility of losing both. For this reason, it's often recommended to ""pinch off"" one embryo. This is done very early in the pregnancy. It's not unusual for a mare to lose a pregnancy, so it's recommended to do an ultrasound and test the blood or urine again after about three months.</p><h3>Don't Rely on Myths</h3><p>Checking how a mare shakes her head, the look in her eyes, or which way a needle moves when held over her belly are accurate methods of determining if she is in foal.</p><h2>Later Stages of Gestation </h2><p>After about three months, the foal will be developing rapidly and start to look like a small horse. After about six months, the mare may start to be visibly pregnant. Mares that have foaled before may show an expanding abdomen sooner than a maiden mare. Over the remaining months, the mare's abdomen will continue to grow as the foal approaches the foaling, or due date. About three to six weeks before the due date, the mare's udder will start to expand, and a few days before giving birth, the teats would produce a sticky yellowish fluid.</p><p>After about 315 days of pregnancy, an owner should watch the mare closely for impending signs of foaling. For example, the yellowish fluid will turn into the first milk or colostrum. The udder may drip, and the muscles around her tail head will become more relaxed. Her belly may appear to drop, as the foal positions for birth. At this point, birth is imminent, and the mare must be checked frequently for signs of foaling.</p><p>Shortly before birth, the mare will appear to be restless, she may paw the ground, or repeatedly look toward her flank (hip) area on either side (similar to colic symptoms). She should be stalled in a large, clean stall, preferably bedded with straw. The mare may lie down and get up repeatedly, but she will likely give birth lying down. First, the amniotic sac may be visible, and then the foal's front hooves and nose should appear. The foal is normally delivered within a few minutes at this stage.</p><p>Occasionally, a foal is in the 'breech' position. Sometimes the mare or foal is injured during the birthing process or may have other issues that require urgent or professional attention.<br/></p><h3>What Is the Breech Position?</h3><p>When the hind limbs or quarter of the foal is delivered first.</p><p>Horse owners should also be aware of a ""red bag"" delivery. This is a critical emergency that cannot be delayed (not even for the arrival of the vet). During normal foaling, a whitish, translucent membrane should first appear through the vulva of the mare. This membrane should encase the foal. If, however, a bright red, velvety membrane appears instead, coming through the vulva of the mare, this indicates that the placenta has prematurely separated from the inner lining of the uterus.</p><p>The placenta supplies the foal with oxygen, and if this becomes prematurely separated before the foal can breathe on its own, the foal would be deprived of oxygen. This can lead to various neurological effects or the foal may even suffocate. Every second counts in such cases and the mare must be manually assisted in the delivery of the foal. The red bag must be ruptured immediately to allow the foal to breathe.</p><p>For every foaling, your veterinarian should check both mare and foal carefully shortly after the delivery.</p>",1016
14,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-horses-express-stress-1887396,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>Telltale Signs of Stress in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Telltale Signs of Stress in Horses</h1><p>A number of things can make horses stressed, like being alone, loading and riding in a trailer, veterinary care, farrier work, preparing for and going to shows, changes in weather, changes in the people caring for them, changes in routine such as a new stall or differing feeding schedule, stall rest due to injury or illness, and a stressed handler or rider. Horses express psychological stress in a number of ways.</p><h2>Weight Loss </h2><p>Horses that are chronically psychologically stressed can start to lose weight. As there can be many reasons for this, such as heat stress, parasites, poor feed, and health problems, it's necessary to look at all aspects of the horse's care to determine the cause of the weight loss.</p><h2>Stall Walking and Other Vices </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>Stall walking is when a horse walks around a stall or walks back and forth along one wall repetitively. Weaving, cribbing, wood chewing, wall kicking, and fence walking are all signs of stress.</p><h2>Yawning </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>Most of us yawn when we are tired. It's the way our bodies inhale a little extra oxygen to fuel our sleepy brain. Horses, however, don't yawn for the same reason,nor is it an appeasement gesture, as in dogs.</p><p>Yawning (and most horses will do it several times in a row) can be a sign that the horse might be feeling stressed, and by yawning, it is releasing this stress.</p><h2>Tooth Grinding </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>Some horses grind their teeth while stabled, some while ridden. Tooth grinding can be a sign of physical or physiological stress. If the horse has no other dental issues, it's important to check for things like equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) and other sources of chronic pain or stressful situations.</p><h2>Bad Behavior </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>Many examples of poor behavior while being ridden, can be caused by physiological or physical stress. Stress can be expressed through pawing, pulling, tail wringing, bucking, rearing, bolting, or being cold backed (sensitive in the back).</p><h2>EGUS </h2><p>Many performance horses suffer from equine gastric ulcer syndrome. This can be in response to a stressful show schedule or other stressors.</p><h2>Manure and Urination </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>A horse that is stressed can produce copious amounts of manure within a short time. Some may produce very runny manure. Horses will often urinate if stressed, and if they can't relieve themselves because they can't relax, such as in a trailer or when being ridden, they can become antsier.</p><h2>Licking and Chewing </h2><p>Natural horsemanship concepts suggest that licking and chewing is a sign that a horse is accepting new information, such as during training. As long as this behavior is not abnormally repetitive or compulsive, this action may be more like yawning in its function, as a way to release any stress the horse may be feeling.</p><h2>Colic </h2><p>Colic symptoms may be caused by stress. A new herd mate or changes in routine, weather, or handler can be enough to make some horses mildly colicky. Chronic stress can lead to EGUS, which can cause colic symptoms.</p><h2>Trembling </h2><p>Any number of stressful situations can cause a horse to tremble. Just the appearance of the veterinarian, farrier, or the arrival of a trailer in the yard can cause some horses to start shaking. Usually, as soon as the cause of the stress disappears, the trembling stops.</p><h2>High Pulse and Respiration </h2><p>When a horse becomes stressed, their pulse and respiration rates can increase, sometimes drastically. Thus, it's important to know your horse's baseline values for temperature, pulse and respiration (TPRs).</p><h2>Sweating </h2><p>As a horse's pulse and respiration may increase when stressed, it may also start to sweat (and tremble). Work stress tends to show up between the horse's legs and under the saddle area and can eventually cover the horse's whole body. It depends on how hard and long the horse works. A stressed horse may sweat in patches, however. Patches of sweat can also indicate the location of old injuries.</p><h2>Bolting Food </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>A worried horse often bolts its food. Bolting can lead tochoking, or other digestive disturbances. This can happen in a stall or trailer.</p><h2>Chewing or Biting </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>Some horses express stress by biting things, people, or other horses.</p><h2>How to Alleviate Stress </h2><p>Katherine Blocksdorf</p><p>Much stress can be relieved by providing consistent schedules in natural environments, asmuch as possible. This means frequent turnout, with ample access to food, water, and companionship. ""Show stress"" is more difficult to remedy, but turnout and exercise between shows can be helpful.</p><p>Give horses time to acclimatize to new situations, such as new herd mates or stall locations. Do your best to give horses in trailers a smooth ride. It's almost impossible to prevent all stress, but good basic care should take care of most.</p>",858
15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-horses-lose-weight-1886476,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>Why Horses Lose Weight</h1>,"<h1>Why Horses Lose Weight</h1><h2>Learn Why Horses Lose Weight and What You Can Do About It</h2><p>Tim Graham/ AlamyStock Photo</p><p>If you have a horse that just isn't putting on, or maintaining a healthy weight, here are some reasons and what to do. There are several reasons a horse may lose weight, or fail to put on weight despite eating what appears to be a good diet.</p><p>The most obvious reason a horse may lose weight is because it is not eating enough. Throughout their lives, horses have different nutritional needs. A young horse should be kept healthy, but not overweight at all, as that brings problems of its own. A young horse should be on the lean side.You should just be able to feel the ribs, but not see them sticking out prominently. Overfeeding at this age may cause joint problems.</p><h2>Working Horses </h2><p>As a horse enters its working life, a basic hay or grass diet may not be quite enough. Most horses used for casual riding will be fine, but a horse that is working hard such as a show horse, long distance trail horse, a draft horse used for logging or other high-performance activities may need to be supplemented with grain or other concentrates. Hay or grass may not provide the energy and nutrition it needs. If you are competing with your horse, or riding demanding trails, or hauling logs out of the bush every day, you might notice your horse lose weight and it will need a few extra meals to stay in good shape. It's not uncommon for broodmares to lose weight as they nurse a foal.</p><h2>Summer Weight Loss </h2><p>It's not unusual for horses in the summer months to lose weight. The heat combined with pesky biting insects can run a horse down very quickly. Especially susceptible to the stress of heat and bugs are senior horsesand those with very sensitive skins. Many thoroughbreds have this problem. In addition to protection from the heat of the day, and the bites of the mosquitoes and other flies, horses that have problems keeping weight on in summer could benefit from extra feed, whether it's good-quality hay in the barn where it can relax and eat without fretting at the bugs, or a concentrate or supplement to help put on weight.</p><h2>Cold Weather </h2><p>Cold weather means your horse requires more energy for your horse to stay warm. Providing a warm blanket and snug shelter out of the wind and wet will help your horse stay in condition. The best way to keep your horse warm and at a healthy weight is to offer lots of good-quality hay.</p><p>Older horses sometimes have problems keeping in good condition. As they age they may not digest food as efficiently, have a harder time staying warm and the aches caused by arthritis or other chronic pain may cause stress leading to weight loss.</p><h2>Dental Problems </h2><p>The most common reason for weight loss in older horsesis dental problems. Horse's teethdon't grow forever, and eventually, they may fall out. Even if they haven't fallen out, they may have sharp edges and hooks that make it difficult and painful for the horse to chew its food efficiently. This particular problem isn't exclusive to older horses. Many horses in the prime of their lives can have dental problems that interfere with chewing. Regular dental care is important for your horse throughout its lifetime.</p><h2>Parasites </h2><p>Parasites can take their toll on horses at any stage of life. Regular de-worming is essential to avoid a heavy internal parasite load that not only cause weight loss but damage internal organs as well. External parasites can be a problem too. In particular, a virulent lice infestation can cause a horse to lose condition. Foals and older horses may be particularly affected.</p><h2>Pecking Order </h2><p>Within a herd of horses, even a small herd such as we keep on our own properties, there are bullies and underdogs. Often the underdogs are bullied away from bale feeders or the best grazing. This can lead to weight loss simply because the horse that is being bullied can't get enough to eat in addition to being stressed.</p><h2>Disease and Illness </h2><p>A number of health problems can cause weight loss. Ulcers are common, especially in performance horses. EPM, HYPP, Cushings, EGUS or Gastric Ulcers, mineral or vitamin deficiencies and diseases such as cancer or kidney and liver disorders can cause appetite and digestive problems leading to weight loss.</p><h2>What to Do Next </h2><p>The first step to discovering the cause of the weight loss is to determine exactly how much the horse is eating. This might mean separating it from the other horses for a while. Deworming medication should be administered and don't underestimate the importance of water in your horse's diet. Feeding For Weight gain offers some tips for what to feed your lean horse. If after increasing the feed and being sure the horse is dewormed, there is no improvement you may need to consult a veterinarian about checking the horse's teeth. If after dental work is done, there is still no improvement the veterinarian can take blood samples to ensure there is no condition or disease causing the weight loss.</p>",854
16,https://www.thesprucepets.com/understanding-how-your-horse-sees-1887324,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>Understanding How Horses See</h1>,"<h1>Understanding How Horses See</h1><p>It's easy to think that horses and other animals perceive things exactly like we do. There's no way to know exactly how horses seebecause we can't see the world with a horse's eyes and brain, but by studying the individual components of the horse's eye, scientists can gain an understanding of what it is capable of. The structure and position of their eyes aresomewhat different than humans', which makes a difference in the distance, color, vividness, and visual field a horse experiences.</p><h2>Color Perception </h2><p>Many people think that animals, including horses, are colorblind and only see in shades of gray. This is not true. Horses do see color, but they may not see it as vividly as we do. This is because they can only see two of the three visible wavelengths in the light spectrum, which is somewhat similar to the way colorblind humans see. Your horse doesn't see the color red, but it can see blues and greens, so the red apple or the bright orange carrot you offer as a treat may actually appear brownish or greenish to your horse.</p><h2>Night Vision </h2><p>If you've ever called your horses in from a pasture in the dark, you'll no doubt have been surprised as they barreled towards you at a wild gallop, but arrived without stumbling over rough ground. They may not see color as well as we do, but they see much better in the dark than we can because their eyeballs have more of the structures that pick up light. If you've taken a picture of a horse with a camera flash, you may see that the horse has ghostly white eyes. This is caused by the , a membrane at the back of the eye that reflects light and also aids their night vision. Conditions that would leave us groping for the light switch or flashlight are less worrisome for a horse.</p><p>If you've ever walked into the barn at night and flipped the light on suddenly, you'll probably have noticed that the horses blink for quite a long time afterward. This is because it takes longer for them to adjust to rapidly changing light levels. This may also explain why some horses are hesitant to enter dark trailers where they have to go from the bright sunlight to a shadowy trailer. The sudden changes in light levels gives less time for their eyes to adjust.</p><h2>Spatial Perception </h2><p>As prey animals, horses' vision played an essential role in being able to see predators and take flight before they ended up as dinner. Eyes set on the side of their headsrather than on the front like oursenable the horse to have almost 360-degree vision. They are unable to see a short distance directly in front of them and directly behind them, which is why one of the safety rules for working with horses is to speak to them when moving behind them. Since a horse has difficulty seeing things directly in front of them, when they are negotiating jumps, a narrow bridge, or other obstacles, they may briefly be doing it while effectively blind. However, because the retinas of their eyes are very large, horses have very good peripheral vision. A subtle turn of the head allows a horse to focus in on an object.</p><p>Horses may see into the distance better than we do. It's also likely that they can see motion with greater sensitivity than we can, which is very important for spotting predators before they become a real threat. Horses also seem to be able to see things in more detail than many other animals.</p><h2>Eye Color </h2><p>Horses may have brown or blue eyes, with brown eyes being far more common. Appaloosas, Paints, Pintos, and other horses with lots of white on their faces will sometimes have blue eyes. There's no difference in the vision of these horses, although some people may feel they look more likely to spook.</p><h2>Natural Eye Protection </h2><p>The protective layer in the corner of a horse's eye, called the nictitating membrane, helps prevent irritation from dust and objects like grass seeds and stems. You'll often see a bit of tearing and grime in this area that can be wiped away with a soft damp sponge or cloth as part of your grooming routine.</p><p>Thinking that horses see the same way we do would be a mistake. It's important to understand how they perceive the world, why they react the way they do to shadows and changes in light, and the extent of their close-up and distance vision. When we're doing things like designing stables, loading horses on trailers, or riding out on trail,it helps to understand what those things look like from the horse's point of view.</p>",783
17,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-assess-healthy-horse-weight-1886844,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>How to Assess the Healthy Weight For A Horse</h1>,"<h1>How to Assess the Healthy Weight For A Horse</h1><h2>Basic Body Condition Assessment - Determining Your Horse's Ideal Weight</h2><p>Is your horse too fat or too skinny? There are a few different ways to score a horse's body condition and weight. For most of us however, there really are three criteriatoo fat, to thin and just right. Anything other than 'just right' is a cause for concern and a change in the animal's diet, housing and workload is in order. Weight doesn't tell the whole story when it comes to a horse's health, but is one indication of overall condition.</p><p></p><h2>Too Fat </h2><p>How do you determine if your horse is too skinny or too fat? There are some key areas to look at. The first area is over the ribs, between the girth area and loins. Here, you should be able to feel the ribs easily under your fingers, but not see them. It may be difficult to feel the ribs on a 'too fat' horse. A too fat horse may have a 'crest' or fat pad along the top or along the sides of the neck where the mane emerges. This is different than the crest developed by stallions, and may feel very hard. The back may be flat or there may be a pronounced dip along the spine. I've seen very fat horses with such a deep crease down their back you'd think it would catch water in the rain.</p><p>Very fat horses will develop fat pads on either side of the tail head, and behind the point of the elbow in the girth area. Over all the too fat will look rounded, have little muscle definition, with haunches that are 'apple cheeked' over the top. The horse may also have a 'hay belly', but skinny horses can have hay bellies toodistended bellies due to the intake of large quantities of fodder.</p><p>Too fat for a horse is not just a condition problem. Along with 'too fat' comes the risk of laminitis, EMS, more stress on joints and cardiovascular system and poor fertility. Too fat in mature horses is a health risk, but too fat in young stock is even more of a problem as joints and bones can be seriously and permanently damaged.</p><p>Without compromising the nutrition the horse needs, the too fat horse will need to lose weight. This is best done gradually, because just like people, horses can develop health problems if weight is lost too quickly. Horses still need grass or hay, but in smaller quantities at frequent intervals. Leaving a horse with an empty stomach can also lead to equine ulcers. Breeds like Quarter Horses and most ponies that are 'easy keepers' can become too fat very easily.</p><h2>Too Skinny </h2><p>A too skinny horse will be bony, and muscle definition will be the only contour. On a very skinny horse, even the muscles will waste away, so the horse looks sunken and gaunt. It's easy to confuse a too skinny horse with a horse in very fit, muscular condition like race horses and long distance horses. These horses do not carry very much body fat, but their muscles are well defined and strong. The too skinny horse may look ewe necked, the withers may appear very pronounced and the spine may be easily felt beneath the skin. The ribs and hip bones may be sharply visible and easily felt and the haunches appear sunken.</p><p>Horses become too thin for a number of reasons including lack of food, stress or illness. It's important to discover why a horse is skinny, in order to provide the right feeds or treatment. If a stressed horse also has ulcers, the environment needs to be changed and the ulcers treated. Mares that are nursing foals can lose weight rapidly, especially when mothering happens when heat and biting insects are at their height. Some breeds like Thoroughbreds and Arabians can be 'hard keepers' and may become 'too skinny' easily.</p><h2>Just Right </h2><p>The horse that is in the perfect has ribs that can be felt, but not visible. Muscle definition is visible, with no pads of soft fat over neck, girth area or haunches. The horse does not look gaunt or rounded, but smooth. The neck looks smooth without being cresty or gaunt.</p><p>There are a few systems used by veterinarians to score body condition. The most common method is the Henneke Body Condition Chart. Horses are scored on a scale from one to nine with one being 'poor' and nine being 'extremely fat'. When we first met Trillium, she was about a 1.5. Currently she is about 7.5 and has been put on a diet. The University of Kentucky offers a useful PDF that describes how to use the Henneke Condition Chart and explains the methods of scoring.</p>",789
18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-leg-wraps-or-bandages-1886226,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness,<h1>Choosing Leg Wraps or Bandages</h1>,"<h1>Choosing Leg Wraps or Bandages</h1><h2>Selecting Leg Wraps or Bandages for Your Horse</h2><p>There are many reasons why you might want to wrap your horse's leg. And there are different techniques for applying wraps and reasons for wrapping. Here are the most common types of wraps or bandages you'll need to know.</p><h2>Stable Wraps or Standing Bandages </h2><p>In the stall, standing wraps or stable wraps help prevent 'stocking up'. Stocking up is when fluids settle in the legs because the horse is standing on a hard surface and not moving around to keep the fluid flushed out of the tissues. You many have to secure a wound dressing or poultice if your horse is injured. You may wish to avoid possible stall injuries if your horse is particularly fractious when kept in. If you're headed for a show, stall wraps can help keep your horse's legs clean, and if there is a wound, bandages can help keep that clean and protected. Horses can be turned out in wraps. This is to protect the horse from pasture injuries and protect existing injuries.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Polo Wraps or Exercise Bandages</h2><p>Bandages or wraps used while riding protect a horse from scraping itself on obstacles such as jumps or gymkhana props and provides support when doing high-performance activities such as jumping, barrel racing or other sports that put a lot of strain on a horse's legs. Polo wraps or exercise bandages may also be used to protect and support the legs while longeing, as the small circle the horse is traveling in can put a lot of stress on the legs.</p><p>Polos are used for decoration too. My daughter's drill team made red wraps for their pony's and horse's legs so help the team look coordinated. You might also see wraps on parade horses. Since polos come in lots of fun colors (and are easy to make) there are lots of decorative choices.</p><h2>Choosing Wrap or Bandage Type and Length </h2><p>The wraps used for shipping (trailering), stable and turn out are longer than polo wraps. Standing or shipping wraps are also applied over 'cottons' or thick quilted pads. Polo wraps are used alone. The exact length you must buy will depend on the size of your horse. The lengths of the wraps are usually are designated in pony, horse or large horse sizes, exact measurement by the inch or centimeter or small, medium, long and extra long. Stable bandages are usually about six inches wide.</p><p>Polos will be narrower and are shorter in length than stable or standing wraps. This is because polos are not applied over padding. Most horses will require medium or horse sized wraps. A pony or small horse with fine bones may need pony sized wraps and if you have a very large boned or draft type horse, you'll need to get the longest wraps. The good thing about long wraps is that most are easy to shorten with a pair of scissors if they happen to be to long.</p><p>Older wraps may have shoelace like ties that were tied in a bow. Newer wraps have hook and loop fastener strips. When choosing a set of leg wraps, if you have the choice, get wraps with wider fasteners. Narrow lace ties and fasteners will not distribute the pressure as evenly as wide fasteners. This is important because tight wraps and pressure points can be very damaging to a horse's legs.</p><p></p><h2>Shipping Wraps </h2><p>When traveling, wraps or bandages help support and protect your horse's legs. As horses balance themselves in a truck ortrailer, they can easily step on their own or each other's feet or scrape up against the side or partition of the box. Wraps also help keep the legs clean if you're traveling to a show. Shipping boots may be easier to put on and take off, but most horse owners agree that bandages actually provide more support than a boot.</p><h2>Using Cottons </h2><p>Stable or standing wraps should be applied over padding or 'cottons'. Cottons are thick rectangles of quilted fabric. They help distribute the pressure of the wrap. For wound dressing, a material like Animal Lintex or gamgee that you keep in your first aid kit might be used under or instead of the cotton padding. Again, cottons come in different sizes, and you'll need to match the cotton to your horse's size.</p><p>Most cottons and wraps are made with synthetic materials or are a cotton blend. To clean them, you can simply throw them in the washing machine. An extra rinse ensures there is no detergent residue to irritate a horse's legs. Hang wraps to dry and re-roll for the next use. Put them in the dryer only if you like detangling big knots!</p>",775
19,https://www.thesprucepets.com/most-common-internal-horse-parasites-5324880,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>9 Most Common Internal Horse Parasites</h1>,"<h1>9 Most Common Internal Horse Parasites</h1><p>Although disgusting to think about, one of the mainstays of good horse ownership is controlling your horse's internal parasite, or worm, burden. Depending on the type, these worms can cause anything from discomfort and tail-rubbing, poor haircoat, weight loss, or even life-threatening gastrointestinal obstruction and colic. Drugs called dewormers, also known as anthelmintics, were wildly successful at treating the most common and devastating horse worms for decades. However, just like bacteria against antibiotics, the worms have found a way to fight back and develop resistance. It is important for caretakers to know the different types of horse internal parasites and to develop an educated deworming strategy.</p><p>Here are the most common internal horse parasites and how you can prevent them.</p><h2>Small Stronglyes </h2><p>Small strongyles are the most common internal parasite in horses today. They are found worldwide, and any grazing horse is infected with some amount of these worms. Horses will only experience disease if the numbers of internal worms are quite high. Small strongyle eggs are passed in horse manure and hatch on pasture. The horse eats the larvae, which burrow into the horse's intestinal wall, emerging seasonally to hatch and produce more eggs. The intestinal wall affected by lots of larval burrowing is less able to digest and absorb nutrients. Therefore, a poor-quality haircoat, pot-bellied appearance, poor muscling, diarrhea, and other signs of ill-thrift are signs of high cyathostomin burden.</p><p>It is important to realize that this worm has been quite good at developing resistance to deworming medications. To prevent a time when no medication effectively treats any horse with small strongyles, work with your veterinarian to develop a deworming strategy that considers season and how many worm eggs your horse is shedding in its manure at any given time (fecal egg count ).</p><h2>Large Strongyles </h2><p>Large strongyles used to be a major cause of colic and death in horses. Also known as the equine bloodworm, these worms are ingested from pasture but migrate into the bloodstream of the large intestine as larvae before moving back into the large intestine as adults to release eggs. Arterial irritation by worm migration cause clots to form and migrate, while blockage of vessels can lead to loss of oxygen-carrying blood supply to part or all of the intestine, causing damage that often cannot be repaired even surgically.</p><p>Luckily this worm is still very sensitive to dewormers and effective against small strongyles, so your deworming strategy against cyathostomins should also be effective against large strongyles.</p><h2>Tapeworms </h2><p>Tapeworms are the third most clinically significant internal parasite of the adult horse. They have worldwide distribution but are less common in arid and pasture-poor environments. Horses inadvertently ingest a mite that carries the infective stage of the parasite. The parasite then matures into a worm and attaches to areas of the digestive system, specifically the end of the small intestines called the ileum and the start of the large intestines called the cecum. These attachment sites are clinically significant because a large tapeworm burden in this area can lead to gastrointestinal motility problems and life-threatening forms of colic. Once attached, the tapeworm sheds egg-filled segments to be excreted in manure.</p><p>Tapeworm burden cannot be diagnosed on fecal egg count, but the worm is very susceptible to a dewormer called praziquantel, which should be given at least once yearly, in the late fall or early winter.</p><h2>Ascarids </h2><p>Ascarids are a major cause of colic in foals and weanlings, but natural immunity is developed as a horse ages past about a year old. Ascarid eggs are remarkably hardy and remain viable in the environment. Once ingested by the foal, they hatch and release larvae. These larvae migrate through the liver, lungs, then trachea, where they are coughed up and re-ingested to mature in the small intestines before releasing eggs. Because of this circuitous lifecycle, foals most at risk of small intestinal obstruction by large amounts of maturing ascarids are usually around 5 months old. This obstruction often manifests as abdominal distension and colic behavior such as pawing and rolling.</p><p>A dewormer that causes the worms to die at once can lead to obstruction as well, so a careful deworming program specific to foals should be developed.</p><h2>Pinworms </h2><p>Pinworms are found worldwide, and any horse is susceptible. Horses ingest the egg, which then hatches and invades the intestinal wall, which doesn't result in clinical disease. However, after maturation, worms migrate and lay their eggs on the perianal skin, which becomes immensely itchy for the horse. This results in tail-rubbing and loss of tail hair. Diagnosis can be made by looking for the worms on a piece of cellophane tape after it has been stuck to the tail headthe worms are thin and white.</p><p>Treatment consists of washing the tail and perianal area and a dewormer recommended by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Bots </h2><p>Bots are the larval stage of the equine botfly and are extremely common. The fly lays its eggs on the horse's legs, which look like small yellow dots. These eggs can be difficult to remove and sometimes clipping the limbs or a specialized tool called a bot knife is required. If eggs are allowed to hatch, the horse will ingest the larva when self-grooming or grooming pasture mates. These larvae then migrate to the stomach where they may live for several months before being passed in feces to mature into flies.</p><p>Bots rarely cause disease aside from mild irritation and are extremely susceptible to ivermectin, a commonly used dewormer.</p><h2>Equine Stomach Worm </h2><p>While the stomach worm can cause irritation of the stomach wall, termed gastritis, the problem most associated withis the summer sore. In a normal life cycle, adult house or horse flies unknowingly transport stomach worm larvae from manure to the area around the horse's mouth where the larvae are ingested, mature, and lay eggs to be passed with manure. However, if the fly lands on a wound, the larvae can't be ingested and complete their lifecycle, and so they migrate within the wound. This causes inflammation and irritation, with non-healing of the wound compounded by the horse trying to relieve the itchiness associated with the sore.</p><p>These summer sores can be very difficult to treat and often require multiple approaches including deworming with ivermectin or moxidectin paste. Fly control is the best preventative.<sup>1</sup></p><h2>Lungworm </h2><p>Lungworm eggs are passed in feces, usually passed from donkeys to horses. These eggs hatch and become larvae before being ingested. They then migrate from the intestine to the lungs where they mature, leading to bronchitis or even pneumonia. Affected animals often have a cough and unthriftiness. Infection with lungworm once leads to partial or total immunity from future infections.</p><p>Common dewormers such as moxidectin and ivermectin are effective.</p><h2>Threadworm </h2><p>The equine threadworm is transmitted in a mare's milk to her offspring or by penetration of the foal's skin through bedding and is quite commonly found in foals one to two weeks of age. The primary medical problem for a foal with threadworm infection is diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration. Deworming the mare with an anthelmintic effective against strongyloides within 24 hours of foaling will reduce the transmission of this parasite to the newborn. However, clinical disease associated with the threadworm is rare and natural immunity is developed with age.</p>",1239
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/grease-heel-scratches-or-mud-fever-1886375,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Grease Heel in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Grease Heel in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Grease heel is a condition that affects horses by causing inflammation, scabbing, and cracked skin around the lower legs and heels. Most commonly seen in the spring and fall, grease heel typically develops when horses stand in muddy or wet conditions that harbor bacteria. This leads to dry skin that eventually becomes cracked, then emits a thick fluid that can appear greasy. Any breed of horse can develop grease heel in wet weather, but those that spend time in dewy pastures or areas that stay damp are at higher risk (making regular stall maintenance especially important during rainy seasons). Horses that are more prone to sunburns or solar dermatitis, like those with white socks or pasterns, may also be more likely to develop greasy heel. Grease heel is unsightly, and while it's not immediately dangerous, it can cause your horse to become lame and risk serious infections if left untreated. When this condition is caught early, persistent home treatment can be effective.</p><h2>What Is Grease Heel? </h2><p>Grease heel is a type of dermatitis caused by bacteria that leads to inflammation on the skin of horses, typically affecting the heels or lower legs after the horse is exposed to wet weather conditions. Since its common names tend to be regional, horse owners may also hear this condition referred to as dermatitis verrucosa,seborrheic dermatitis, mud fever, scratches, dew poisoning, or greasy heel. Grease heel may begin low on the horse's body and concentrated around the heels, but it can also spread up the legs to affect the cannon area.<br/></p><h2>Symptomsof Grease Heel in Horses </h2><p>Grease heel appears on the lower legs as patches of scurf beneath the hair.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Itchiness and Irritation </h3><p>The hair itself will start to look thin or matted. Under the scurf, the skin will be itchy and irritated. If the grease heelis mild, it may only look dry and have dandruff. It may not be as obvious on horses with a lot of feathering on their lower legs.</p><h3>Cracked, Red Skin </h3><p>When greasy heel isn't caught early, the skin on your horse's heels will become more inflamed and cracked. Cracked skin in the lower legs can be difficult to heal since the area is always flexing as the horse walks. The pain from the inflamed skin can cause the horse to appear lame.</p><h3>Discharge From Affected Areas </h3><p>As the condition progresses, a thick, mucous-like fluid will begin to emit from the affected area. This symptom is how the name ""grease heel"" was coined, as it can appear greasy over irritated skin. Thelesions may become crusty as the fluid dries onto the affected areas.</p><h3>Granulomas </h3><p>Left untreated, the skin can become deeply cracked and eventually infected. Granulomas may develop in more serious cases. This type of scar tissue and equine cellulitis consists of inflammation in the deeper layers of skin, resulting in heat and swelling in the legs.</p><h2>Causes of Grease Heel </h2><p>The same conditions that cause rain scald also cause grease heel:microbes that thrive in mud and wet areas. Grease heel is typically caused by the same bacteria that's seen in rain scald cases, but if it's left untreated, other bacteria can also infect your horse.</p><h2>Diagnosing Grease Heel in Horses </h2><p>If you suspect that your horse may be developing grease heel, schedule a veterinary appointment as soon as possible to properly diagnose the affected area and begin treatment. Your vet will likely examine the horse and determine whether its living conditions are the cause of the problem. If they know your horse's history, your vet may be able to complete the diagnosis with a simple examination, but they may also test for bacteria. These tests typically consist of an acetate tape impression or samples from the horse's hair that can be examined under a microscope.<br/></p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Mild grease heel can be treated at home by brushing away any dirt and dead hair, washing the affected area with antiseptic or anti-fungal soap, and working a topical through the hair onto the skin (like an antiseptic cream or zinc oxide paste). Some horse owners claim that creams designed to treat yeast infections are effective, but zinc oxide creams and lotions are also a great option. Look for diaper creams such as Ihle's Paste or Desitin with a high quantity of zinc oxide.Keep the area clean and dry, and continue treating it until the condition is gone.</p><p>If the grease heel is severe, owners may need to wrap the area to prevent dirt from sticking to the cream. However, wraps and bandages can hold in moisture, so they should be replaced often with the horse's skin dried thoroughly between uses. Your veterinarian might recommend using a drying spray like Cetrigen each day to keep moisture at bay until the area heals fully.</p><p>If the grease heel covers a large area, has become badly cracked or there is any evidence of swelling or infection, call your veterinarian. Granulomas caused by grease heel can be removed by a veterinarian.</p><p>Any brushes or equipment used on a horse with grease heel should be sterilized before use on another horse. It may be helpful to keep a separate set of brushes for each horse being treated to prevent cross-contamination. Wash your hands after treating your horse to avoid spreadinggrease heel and other skin conditionsto others.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Grease Heel </h2><p>In most cases, grease heel can be treated with simple at-home care steps by owners. Most horses affected by this condition should make full recoveries once the bacteria is successfully removed. Horses should be stabled during treatment to prevent any new bacteria from developing and for owners to closely observe the treatment process, making any adjustments as necessary. Once your horse has recovered, preventative care is important to avoid future infections.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Grease Heel </h2><p>Grease heel may appear to disappear or be slightly betterduring dry weather, but it can flare up quickly when the weather turns damp again.</p><h3>Maintain Proper Living Conditions </h3><p>Keep your horse in clean, dry conditions. Clean the stalls and don't allow dampness or ammonia from urine to build up. Keep paddocks and pastures free of manure build-up, and improve drainage if mud becomes a problem. Avoid turning horses out in dewy pastures when grease heel is a high risk.</p><h3>Groom Frequently </h3><p>Frequent grooming can remove the dirt and dander that give themicrobes a home. Wash your horse's legs down after exercise to remove sweat, and ensure they are always dried thoroughly. During wet weather, owners can also apply creams like Sudocrem to the lower legs to waterproof these areas (though care should be taken to wash and dry the legs first; otherwise, bacteria may be trapped inside).</p><h3>Use Sunscreen on At-Risk Horses </h3><p>If your horse has white socks or pasterns, an especially helpful prevention method is to apply sunscreen to these white areas on a regular basis. A thin coating can be used every one to two days.</p>",1146
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-locked-stifles-look-like-1886426,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Locked Stifle Joints in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Locked Stifle Joints in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Similar to the human knee, a horse's stifle joints are like hingessome of the largest in its skeletal system.Occasionally, a stifle joint becomes locked due to overstraining or genetic joint problems and predisposing conformation.When this happens, its hind leg appears to be stuck in extension, often causing alarm.But don't stresslocked stifles are relatively common. This condition can happen to any breed of horse or pony, but those with upright hind legs and straighter angles on their hock and stifle joints may be more susceptible. Mild cases may only cause slight lameness, and there are ways to make your horse sound again (often without invasive procedures). Sometimes, simply backing the horse will release the locked stifle. However, if left untreated, horses that display regular locking stifles may be unsafe to ride and require surgery.</p><h2>What Is a Locked Stifle Joint? </h2><p>A locked stifle joint happens when one of the horse's ligaments remains hooked over a ridge on the head of its femur bone during movement. Stifle joints help the horse bend its rear legs and stabilize itself, and these joints are actually meant to lock when standing. This importantfunction is part of a horse's stay apparatus (an arrangement of muscles, tendons, and ligaments in the horse's hind limbs that work together so it can remain standing using very little muscular effort).</p><p>This action comes into play when horses sleep, keeping them upright on their feet. Normally, the horse can flex the joint with little effort to unlock it. However, in some horses, unlocking becomes delayed. A small delay will cause mild symptoms, but long delays result in more severe symptoms. Medically, this condition is called ""upward fixation of the patella.""</p><h2>Symptoms of Locked Stifle Joints in Horses </h2><p>A horse with a locked stifle may develop a slight lameness in the hindquarters which, when mild, can be easily overlooked. In more serious cases, locked stifle joints can cause the horse to struggle to move normally or even lock the leg fully.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>A simple hesitancy can result as the horse responds to discomfort and stiffness, especially after standing still for long periods of time. The horsecan stumble or knuckle in the back end, especiallyon downward transitions like a trail ride with a descending slope. A locked stifle may also cause a horse to short step and display difficulty changing leads at the canter. Or, it can make your horse canter on different leads in the front and the back or hop slightly, flinging its back leg. If you notice your horse having problems working in a circle or dragging its toes, don't write it off as bad behavior or a bad habit. Consult your vet to diagnose the issue so that treatment can begin.</p><p>In severe cases, a horse's hind leg will appear obviously locked, making it hard to overlook. It may stretch its leg out behind it when trying to walk, or it may kick backward and step oddly to get the stifle joint to release. Your horse may not be able to alleviate its locked joint on its own and may drag its leg behind.Then, for no visible reason, theleg may snap back into a normal position (you may even hear a click). If this happenseven if everything appears fineget it checked by a professional.</p><h2>Causes of Locked Stifle Joints </h2><p>Locked stifles are most common in ponies, foals, and horses that are unfit, although the exact cause remains unknown.</p><h2>Diagnosing Locked Stifle Joints </h2><p>In severe cases,a locked stiflewill be very obvious. The horse will have difficulty moving its leg normally. However, a locked stifle could also be mistaken for stringhalta neurological disease that causes exaggerated and uncontrollable movement, sometimes making your horse jerk its hind leg up high while stepping. In any case, a veterinarian will need to examine your horse and manipulate its stifle joint to see if they can manually induce the unlocking mechanism. After that, a radiograph may be performed to see if the lameness is caused by something else, such as a bony abnormality. Lastly, your vet may administer a local nerve block to determine if the lameness is actually caused by pain or if it is truly a mechanical issue.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>For mild locked stifle cases, exercise and a balanced hoof trim may help your horse. Lack of fitness causes weak muscles and ligaments, so simply conditioning your horse can sometimes help solve the stifle problem. For severe locking, ask your farrier to ""rocker,"" or roll, the toe of the hoof. They can also fit your horse with corrective shoes and pads to help the hoof break over before the locking occurs.</p><p>Certain cases that do not respond to conditioning or corrective farrier work may call for surgery performed by a veterinary surgeon called a medial patellar desmotomy. During the surgery, a vet makes small incisions in the patellar ligament while the horse is sedated and standing. This frees the strain of the ligament, allowing for ample movement within the joint (and alleviating the catching). However, since freeing the ligament often causes instability in the patella itself, the downside to this surgical treatment is the potential development of both arthritis and bone spurs.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Locked Stifle Joints </h2><p>Locked stifle joints are often mild to moderate problems that can be remedied through exercise, corrective shoeing, and hoof trims that allow the horse to unlock its joint through natural movements. Horses dealing with severely locked stifle joints can still live happy, healthy lives after being treated by a veterinarian or undergoing surgery. Owners of horses that have medial patellar desmotomy surgeries should also be mindful of any future developments that may indicate arthritis or bone spurs. Seek veterinary help if any signs of these issues begin to appear.</p><h2>How to Prevent Locked Stifle Joints </h2><p>Some horses are more likely to experience locked stifle joints than others, but owners can take preventative care steps to keep their muscles strong and healthy.</p><h3>Gradual Exercise </h3><p>Since the lack of muscle tone may contribute to locked stifles, horses should be exercised gradually. Activities like trail ridingwhile increasing the distance and speed very slowly and over several weekswill help a horse achieve its ideal fitness level in a safe way.</p><h3>Strengthening Specific Muscles </h3><p>Try cavaletti training over small wooden jumps or pole work that makes your horse pick up its feet. Lunging your horse on a line or riding it on a slight incline (so that it drives with its hindquarters) also makes for safe training when done in small, slightly increased intervals. It's important to start slowly, avoid overworking your horse, and thoroughly discuss your strategy with a veterinarian before beginning any training regimen if the horse has already experienced locked stifles.</p>",1122
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/copd-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-1886376,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO) in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Recurrent Airway Obstruction (RAO) in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p></p><p>Horses have delicate lungs and are very sensitive toinhaled dust, pollen, and mold spores. Exposure to these irritants over time can lead to a persistent cough, difficulty breathing, and nasal discharge. This allergic response is called recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). Older terms still often used for this condition include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ""heaves"" or ""broken wind.""</p><p>RAO usually first appears when the horse is between nine and 12 years of age. Approximately 12 percent of mature horses have some degree of this respiratory affliction.</p><p>Although RAO is a chronic condition, many horses afflicted with this respiratory problem enjoy long and relatively normal lives. However, management of these horses does require vigilance to ensure the horse isn't overworked or exposed to allergens that trigger breathing difficulties, such as dusty hay. While there's no cure, most horseswith heaves can be comfortable and can be lightly worked.Here's how recurrent airway obstruction develops and what you can do to help your horse.</p><h2>What Is Recurrent Airway Obstruction? </h2><p>Horses' lower respiratory systems, as well as the respiratory systems of other mammals, consist of a large trachea (windpipe) that branches off into two main bronchithese are something like the stems of the lungswhich then branch further into small airways called bronchioles. Recurrent airway obstruction is an allergic response that causes inflammation in the bronchioles. Over time, this causes them to thicken and leak mucus, leading to the characteristic cough, difficulty breathing, and other symptoms of this chronic condition. RAO is considered to be a type of equine asthma.</p><p>While the mechanisms of RAO are not well understood, it is ultimately believed to be caused by the horse's lung's hypersensitivity to allergens, especially hay, straw, mold, and dust. Horses that live in stables and eat hay are the likeliest to develop the condition, but it can strike pastured horses as well. Typically, stabled horses with RAO have the worst symptoms in the winter and spring, while pastured horses suffer the worst symptoms in the summer or early fall.</p><h2>Symptoms of RAO in Horses </h2><p>In the early stages of RAO, or in horses only mildly afflicted with the disorder, the symptoms are generally just a slightly runny nose and dry cough. As the disease progresses, however, symptoms generally become far more severe.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p><br/></p><p>Initially, horses with RAO tend to experience symptoms only when exercising. However, horses with more severe disease display symptoms even when at rest. These horses have a persistent cough and often ""heave"" their sides in and out with the effort of breathing. You'll notice that your horse's nostrils are flared, which is an attempt to draw in air more easily, and the animal is breathing rapidly. Often, there's a yellowish nasal discharge, as well. Your horse's ability to exercise or work will greatly diminish as the disease progresses.</p><p>Horses with severe RAO may lose weight due to a lack of interest in eating. However, a fever is not a normal symptom of this disorder. Development of fever usually indicates a secondary bacterial infection, often pneumonia.</p><h2>Causes of Recurrent Airway Obstruction </h2><p>Recurrent airway obstruction in horses is similar to asthma in humans and is believed to be an allergic response to inhaled antigens, primarily dust, mold spores, hay, and straw. When the horse inhales these common allergens, its airways respond by clamping shut (bronchospasm), narrowing (bronchoconstriction), and secreting mucus.</p><p>There also may be a hereditary component that contributes to a horse's likelihood of developing RAO, as horses with afflicted parents are far likelier to develop the disorder than horses with healthy parents.</p><h2>Diagnosing RAO in Horses </h2><p>Generally, an equine veterinarian can diagnose recurrent airway obstruction based on the horse's characteristic symptoms and history. At times, however, your vet might want to do further testing to establish the diagnosis or rule out other causes of a chronic cough. One such test is a bronchoalveolar lavage, which involves passing a tube into the horse's lungs, ""washing"" the lungs with a saline solution, and then suctioning the saline back out again. This provides a sample of cells from the horse's lungs, as well as the secretions within the airways. Testing this sample can reveal the presence of infection and/or inflammatory changes in the cells.</p><p>Occasionally, your vet might order x-rays of the horse's chest, particularly if there is a concern that the horse has pneumonia or a secondary infection as well as RAO.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Unfortunately, recurrent airway obstruction is a chronic disease that can be managed, but not cured. The mainstay of treatment for RAO is to remove the horse as much as is feasible from the allergy triggers. That means letting a stabled horse outside into a pasture whenever possible, storing hay away from the afflicted horse's stall, and switching from straw bedding to low-dust bedding such as shredded paper or cardboard.</p><p>Feeding the horse water-soaked hay is an option if the RAO is mild. However, horses with more severe disease will need a switch to a complete pellet feed instead of hay. The barn or stable should be kept as dust-free as possible.</p><p>Some horses will also require medications to control their condition, particularly during flares of symptoms. The most commonly prescribed medications include systemic or inhaled bronchodilators, which help to open the constricted airways, and systemic or inhaled corticosteroids, which help to relieve inflammation. These medications might be used only when the horse is in respiratory distress due to a flare of symptoms, or long-term to help manage symptoms in horses with severe disease that cannot easily be kept away from allergy-triggering antigens.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Recurrent Airway Obstruction </h2><p>With proper management and treatment, horses with mild to moderate cases of RAO can lead fairly normal lives. However, they will need to be closely monitored for flare-ups of symptoms, and may never be able to work or exercise as hard as healthy horses.</p><p>More severely affected horses are not able to work or exercise, and are likelier to develop secondary pneumonia or other respiratory infections. These horses have a poorer prognosis.</p><h2>How to Prevent Recurrent Airway Obstruction </h2><p>It may be difficult to prevent RAO entirely, as it's hard to predict if your horse will develop the disease or not. But this chronic lung condition builds gradually. If recognized early, good feed and stable management may slow or prevent its progression, and the horse may be able to take on an almost normal workload. If the horse is continually exposed to the irritants, however, the disease may progress to the point where it is unable to thrive.</p><p>Make sure that any fodder and bedding are mold and dust-free. A well-ventilated stable is essential for keeping your horse's lungs healthy. Outdoor turnout is the best way to provide lots of fresh air as well as fresh grassrather than dusty hayfor feeding.</p><",1123
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/eye-infections-and-injuries-in-horses-1886406,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Eye Infections in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Eye Infections in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Eye infectionsin horsesare common but require prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent permanent injury or blindness. Eye infections are caused by various bacterial, viral, fungal, and allergen irritants. The two most common infections are conjunctivitis and equine recurrent uveitis, which cause uncomfortable symptoms in the eye. A vet can diagnose the cause of your horse's eye infection through a physical examination, culturing, and sometimes an MRI or CT scan. If you catch and treat an eye infection early, the prognosis is typically optimistic but dependent on the stage of the infection and its cause.</p><h2>What Are Eye Infections? </h2><p>An eye infection is a disease of the eye caused by harmful bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Horses can develop eye infections like conjunctivitis, and equine recurrent uveitis (ERU), sometimes caused by injury to the eye or exposure to allergens like pollen and dust. Conjunctivitis causes the mucus membrane around the eye to swell and become red. ERU results in recurrent episodes of eye inflammation and is the most common cause of blindness in horses.</p><h2>Symptoms of Eye Infections in Horses </h2><p>There are a variety of symptoms that point to eye infections in horses. An untreated eye infection is very painful for your horse and can lead to complications. Visit your vet right away if you suspect something is wrong with your horse's eye.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Swollen Eyelids </h3><p>Eyelid swelling can happen for a variety of reasons. In addition to blunt head injury and allergies, an eye infection is a likely cause of swollen eyelids in a horse. Visit your vet if you're not sure what's causing your horse's eye to swell.</p><h3>Eye Discharge </h3><p>While some eye discharge is a normal function of a healthy eye, the type of discharge your horse is producing can indicate infection. Some tearing shouldn't be cause for worry, but if the discharge is thick, yellow or white, and pussy, an infection is probably to blame.</p><h3>Tearing </h3><p>If your horse's eye is tearing excessively, it may be a sign of ERU. Again, some tearing is normal, but pay attention to the volume of your horse's tears.</p><h3>Hazy Appearance of the Eye </h3><p>Early in infection, your horse's eye may appear hazy or cloudy. A whiteish film over the eye may indicate ERU. There are many reasons a horse's eye may look cloudy, so pay a visit to your vet for a definitive diagnosis.</p><h3>Redness and Inflammation </h3><p>Redness and inflammation is the most common indicator of any eye infection, and usually points to conjunctivitis or ERU. It can also indicate eye injury or allergies.</p><h2>Causes of Eye Infections </h2><p>There are several causes of eye infections in horses of varying severity. Visit your vet for a definitive diagnosis and a subsequent treatment plan.</p><h2>Diagnosing Eye Infections in Horses </h2><p>A vet can usually diagnose an eye infection quickly through a physical examination of the eye, but the diagnosis doesn't always reveal a cause. Your horse may need to be sedated during this process. If the examination isn't conclusive, your vet may need to swab and test your horse's eye. Your vet will check for damage to the cornea as well as anything that may be lodged in the eye, such as splinters, awns from grasses, or grit. Developments in the microscopic corneal analysis have helped vets to identify funguses and bacteria in horses' eyes. A tool called ancorneal confocal microscope is used to perform this type of exam.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Swift action following diagnosis is key to successfully treating a horse's eye infection. Your vet may begin treatment with an ointment or gel to apply to the eye multiple times a day. If the infection is bacterial, your vet may prescribe antibiotic eyedrops. A horse with a fungal eye infection is likely to be prescribed a topical anti-fungal and may need surgery if ulcers are present. Treatment for ERU centers on managing inflammation and reducing discomfort. Topical inflammatories and corticosteroids can help but won't prevent future flareups. In severe cases, injections into the eye or surgery may be necessary.</p><p>Just because you may see improvement within a few days doesn't mean you should stop the medication before the entire course is up. Stopping treatment before the infection or injury is completely healed can result in the infection flaring up again and possibly causing more damage. In some cases, the cause of the infection (for example, bacteria) may become resistant to the medication if the full course is not administered.</p><p>When treating a horse with an eye problem, be aware that the infection may affect its vision, making it jumpier than usual. Talk gently, so you don't surprise your horse if you walk up on a blind-side.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Eye Infections </h2><p>When treated swiftly, the prognosis for horses with mild eye infections is good. However, an untreated eye infection can lead to blindness and secondary infections.</p><p>The long-term prognosis for horses with ERU isn't as optimistic. More than half of horses with ERU won't be able to return to their normal levels of work and may become blind. Treatment will slow progression but is not curative.</p><h2>How to Prevent Eye Infections </h2><p>Keeping your horse's environment as dust-free as possible can help stave off infection. If hay is dusty orbeddingis very dry, you can dampen it or use other material or bedding. Make sure that sharp edges onwater troughs, metal buildings, fences, or other obstacles are covered or inaccessible to prevent your horse from wounding its eye. Pound in or pull any old nails protruding from fences or other structures. Eye and face nets may help keep flies away from your horse's eyes. If you outfit your horse with a fly mask or veil, ensure it isn't irritating the eye.</p><p>Check your horse's eyes daily to catch the infection early and prevent it from worsening.<br/></p><h2>Types of Eye Infections in Horses </h2><p>Flies can carry harmful parasites transmittable to your horse's eye through contact. Take preventative measures such as fitting your horse with a fly mask to protect its eyes from flies.</p><p>Some tearing signifies a healthy, functioning tear gland, but your horse's eye may be infected if the tearing is excessive. Watch for colored discharge from your horse's eye as well.</p><p>If treated swiftly, your horse will probably not become blind from an eye infection. If you leave an infection like ERU untreated, your horse may suffer from permanent vision damage.</p>",1056

It is caused by infection of the horse's central nervous system with a protozoan, which is a single-celled organism. The most common protozoan to cause EPM is Less commonly, it can be caused by infection with</p><p>Because EPM can affect any part of the horse's central nervous system, which includes the brain and the spinal cord, symptoms can vary, but common signs of this disorder include gait abnormalities, involuntary muscle movements, lethargy, muscle atrophy, and difficulty swallowing.</p><p>Any horse of any age can develop EPM, but it is more common in young horses that race or participate in other athletic activities.</p><h2>What Is Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis? </h2><p>Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is a neurological disease that affects the central nervous system of horses. The term ""myeloencephalitis"" means inflammation of the spinal cord and brain. The disease is caused by a protozoan, usually . This protozoan's primary host is the opossum. The feces of an infected opossum can contain sporocysts, which are the immature, egg-like form of the protozoan. If a horse ingests grass, water, or other substances containing the sporocysts, the horse may develop EPM.</p><p>For reasons that are not well understood, however, only a very tiny percentage of horses exposed to sporocysts from actually develop EPM. In fact, although as many as 90 percent of the horses in some areas of North America test positive for exposure to the sporocysts, less than 1 percent actually develop the disease.<br/></p><h2>Symptoms of EPM in Horses </h2><p>One of the difficulties with diagnosing EPM is that it can look like many other neurological diseases, particularly in the beginning. It is a progressive disease, meaning it tends to worsen over time. However, some horses progress through the illness faster than others, and it is not uncommon for a horse to develop worsening symptoms, then level off for awhile, sometimes even for months, before once again beginning to deteriorate.</p><p>Symptoms can vary depending on whether the horse's brain or spinal cord is more heavily affected. But the following are common symptoms to watch for.<br/></p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The symptoms of EPM can begin quite suddenly or slowly progress over time. As a general rule, the symptoms are asymmetrical, meaning they affect one side of the horse's body more than the other. So you might notice that your horse moves the legs on its left side in an uncoordinated fashion, but still moves them normally on the right. Commonly, the horse will seem to have poor balance and may stumble or move in an abnormal way. Its muscles might atrophy, leading to weakness and further inability to walk normally.</p><p>If the horse's spinal cord is most affected, which is the commonest presentation of EPM, you'll notice more difficulties with movement, balance, and coordination. If the horse's brain is more affected, symptoms can include paralysis in the facial muscles, making it difficult for the horse to swallow or move its tongue, as well as lethargy, behavioral changes, and drooping eyelid.</p><h2>Causes of Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis </h2><p>Some protozoa, including are capable of causing disease in animals. Typically, these types of protozoa require a host animal in which to carry out the reproductive part of their lifecycle. For , that host is the opossum. An opossum ingests the protozoans, which reproduce in the animal's digestive system. The opossum doesn't become ill itself, but does, however, pass infectious sporocysts, or eggs, in its feces.</p><p>When a horse ingests the sporocysts from the grass, water, or ground, they enter its digestive system. For reasons that are not well understood, in a very small percentage of horses the sporocysts mature into a form called merozoites, which then migrate through the horse's bloodstream into its central nervous system. There, they infect the brain and/or spinal cord, causing the disease called equine protozoal myeloencephalitis.</p><p>It is important to note that EPM is not contagious from horse to horse, nor is the horse contagious to other animals.<br/></p><h2>Diagnosing EPM in Horses </h2><p>Diagnosing EPM can be tricky, as it can come on slowly and resemble other neurological diseases initially, such as viral encephalitis, West Nile disease, meningitis, or even rabies. A definitive diagnosis can only be obtained by examining the brain tissue of an infected horse after its death. However, equine veterinarians diagnose their EPM patients indirectly by observing the characteristic signs and symptoms, ruling out other causes of similar symptoms, such as trauma or other infectious diseases, and performing blood tests or tests on the horse's spinal fluid to look for antibodies to , which indicate that the horse has been exposed to the organism.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the most effective course of treatment can begin. There are currently three different FDA-approved treatments for EPM.</p><p>Along with one of the above treatments, many equine vets also prescribe anti-inflammatories such as steroids, vitamin E supplementation, or immune-system-modifying drugs.<br/></p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With EPM </h2><p>With treatment, up to 60 percent of horses with EPM will improve, but less than 25 percent recover completely. Relapses are also common for as long as two years after the initial treatment with anti-protozoal medications. Still, your horse has a good chance of regaining at least some of its former health with prompt intervention. If left untreated, the prognosis for horses with EPM is very poor, as the condition can deteriorate to seizures and death.</p><h2>How to Prevent Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis </h2><p>There is no vaccine for EPM. Prevention consists of minimizing the presence of opossums on your property as much as possible. Wire-mesh fencing can help keep these marsupials out of your stable area, although because opossums are good climbers, you may have to resort to electrified fencing if they are especially persistent.</p><p>Opossums are generally looking for food and are not picky eaters. They will raid trashcans, eat dog food that's left outside, consume your horse's grains, and even eat carcasses of dead animals that they find on the road or within your property. It's essential that all food stores be secure and any animal carcasses buried promptly. Clean up any spilled feed right away, and make sure trashcans have tightly fitted lids.</p><p>If opossums make their home on your property, they should be humanely trapped and removed. Other options are motion-activated lights or sprinklers, which can frighten the animals away.<br/></p>",1061
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/equine-arthritis-1886858,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Arthritis in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Arthritis in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Arthritis is a degenerative joint disease that causes symptoms like stiffness, inflammation, and pain. Just like humans, horses can develop and suffer from arthritis. Arthritis is almost unavoidable as horses age, but early diagnosis and conscientious care can slow its advance and minimize pain. A vet can run many tests and a thorough body examination to determine whether or not your horse has arthritis.</p><h2>What Is Arthritis? </h2><p>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease (DJD) involving the breakdown and loss of the cushioning cartilage that lines the end of bones within a joint.With this breakdown, there is also a loss of lubricating joint fluid, and the joint as a whole loses its ability to cushion impact and provide a gliding surface during motion. This then results in joint pain and leads to lameness in horses. Arthritis in specific locations in horses goes by common colloquial names such as ringbone and bone spavin.</p><h2>Symptoms of Arthritis in Horses </h2><p>The symptoms of arthritis in horses are painful and largely inhibiting motion. If your horse is experiencing any discomfort or you suspect that your horse has arthritis, pay a visit to the vet right away.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p><br/></p><p>In its early stages, arthritis may appear as a slight stiffness that the horse overcomes once they are warmed up. In the joint, the cartilage material is breaking down but not repairing itself efficiently. Eventually, as the cartilage becomes more damaged, the bone beneath the cartilage pad becomes damaged too. The horse will experience more discomfort and even heat in the joint as inflammation occurs. As the disease progresses, the horse may experience more pain and lameness. In more advanced cases, small bony growths called osteophytes may be seen under X-ray and may be felt around the affected joint.</p><h2>Causes of Arthritis </h2><p>Arthritis is caused by the wear and tear of cartilagethe tough, flexible tissue that is the sliding, shock-absorbing surface between the bones that meet at a joint. Over time, compression and stress wear away the protective cartilage. Arthritis most commonly occurs in the weight-bearing joints of the legs. Extra stress or injury to any joint can lead to arthritis.</p><p>Specific sports can make a horse more susceptible to arthritis in certain joints due to repetitive concussive force. Certain types of conformation in a horse can also make it more prone to the development of arthritis. However, as all horses age, as with humans and other animals, repetitive wear and tear cause damage of varying degrees to high motion and weight-bearing joints.</p><p>Equine arthritis can affect any mobile joint in the body, including the knees, shoulder joints, spine, fetlocks, hocks, andstifles. These are all weight-bearing joints. The fetlocks, knees, coffin bone (within the hoof), and hocks are most commonly affected.</p><h2>Diagnosing Horses With Arthritis </h2><p>To diagnose your horse with arthritis, you will need to visit a veterinarian. The vet will perform a full body examination, review medical history, andconduct a series of X-rays. Your vet might also request a sample of joint fluid to check for infection. Other diagnostic procedures may include MRIs, a nuclear bone scan, nerve block examinations, endoscopy, and blood and urine tests.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The goal of arthritis management is to reduce the inflammation in the affected joint, relieve pain, and slow further damage to the joint.</p><p>If you notice that your horse is having any discomfort (even discomfort that wears off quickly), it's a good idea to consult your vet. Your vet may be able to identify arthritis early and slow its progress with drugs that reduce inflammation.</p><p>Once the cartilage in a joint is damaged or gone, it is difficult to repair it. Discomfort can be managed by joint injections of joint fluid supplements like hyaluronic acid and polysulfated glycosaminoglycans and corticosteroids. You can also use oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drugs such as phenylbutazone for pain management. However, long-term use can have negative side effects such as gastric ulcers and the potential for kidney damage.</p><p>For longer-term treatment, medications include firocoxib (an NSAID that works differently than phenylbutazone) and diclofenac sodium, available in a topical cream. Some clinicians are exploring various stem cell therapies. In some cases, depending on the horse and what joints are involved, this modality may also be an option. Shockwave and laser therapies may also be considered.</p><p>In addition to veterinary treatment, a reduction in workload may be necessary, mainly if the work includes jumping, traveling over rough terrain, or other activity that potentially over-stresses the joints. Although light exercise is essential to maintain joint flexibility, this may mean the end of a horse's competitive career. When the horse may be lame, it should not be ridden. Keep the horse on soft footing, with extra but not excessive bedding that may be hard to walk through. Proper trims and shoeing by a knowledgeable farrier may also be helpful.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Arthritis </h2><p>When diagnosed early and managed adequately, you can completely resolve arthritis in horses. Chronic arthritis may persist if the horse doesn't respond to anti-inflammatory treatments or if infection occurs during the healing process.</p><h2>How to Prevent Arthritis in Horses </h2><p>Arthritis, to some degree, is almost unavoidable in older horses. Horses with conformation faults may put extra stress on joints, yet another reason why breeders strive for foals with good conformation. Proper hoof trims and shoeing, good conformation, sturdy footing, andgood basic maintenancecan also help delay the onset of arthritis.</p><p>Arthritis in horses can affect any mobile, weight-bearing joint in the body. These joints include the knees, shoulder joints, spine, fetlocks, hocks, andstifles.</p><p>If you notice that your horse is having any discomfort at all, you should consult your vet. Your vet may be able to identify arthritis early, making the treatment process run more smoothly.</p><p>In addition to treatment by a veterinarian, you may need to reduce your horse's physical workload or sport activity. This is especially true if the work includes jumping, or traveling over rough terrain. Light exercise can be beneficial to maintain joint flexibility, but it may be the end of your horse's competitive career.</p>",1013
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horses-and-sunburn-or-photosensitivity-1887272,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Sunburn or Photosensitivity in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Sunburn or Photosensitivity in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Especially in the summer season, humans and animals alike can experience sunburn. Despite our best efforts to apply plenty of sunscreen and stay in the shade, this condition affects many of us from time to time. Horses are no different, but when it comes to the equine world, sunburn is usually most severe on the nose. Your horse may also experience burns on its back, face, ear tips, and white areas on the legs. Horses with white coats (whether entirely white or in patches on the body) are more susceptible to burns. Some may experience a condition with similar symptoms called photosensitivity caused by the ingestion of certain plants. Sunburn usually resolves on its own, but a variety of treatment options can help ease your horse's symptoms.</p><h2>What Is Sunburn? </h2><p>Sunburn occurs because of overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, which typically causes symptoms like redness, inflammation, and pain. Horses with unpigmented patches on their bodies are more likely to experience sunburn than those with darker coats, noses, and legs. Lesions from burns typically affect parts of the body that come into consistent contact with direct sunlight like the nose and face.</p><h2>Symptoms of Sunburn in Horses </h2><p>Horses experience similar symptoms of sunburn to those seen in humans.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Red skin and inflammation are both common signs of sunburn, although horses may also experience blisters, peeling, scabs, and cracked skin in more severe cases. This is usually limited to the face and nose, but horses that are thin-coated or have pink skin may also become sunburned on their backs. Most commonly, horses with white or pink noses (like grays or pintos) experience sunburn. In some cases, burns can also occur along the protruding areas of the face, ear tips, and white leg markings just as human noses, ears, shoulders, and collarbones get burned from direct exposure to the sun.</p><h2>Causes of Sunburn </h2><p>While exposure to the sun during the hottest parts of the day may be enough to cause a sunburn on your horse, photosensitization can also lead to burns when your horse ingests certain plants.</p><h2>Diagnosing Sunburn in Horses </h2><p>If your horse experiences a normal sunburn that is not linked to photosensitization, your veterinarian can diagnose the condition during a standard physical exam. However, the signs of photosensitization are similar to those of standard sunburns, and a veterinarian should be consulted to determine the underlying cause of your horse's symptoms. Photosensitization may indicate the presence of liver diseases that require further diagnosis. Your equine veterinarian may perform liver biopsies and an evaluation of the liver enzymes along with screening your horse's blood, feces, and urine.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>When it comes to sunburn, treatment options are somewhat limited but typically involve management of symptoms until your horse comfortably recovers. If sunburn affects the back, riders should avoid riding until the burn heals to avoid putting a saddle on top of a painful burn. Any areas of your horse's skin that become cracked or scabbed should be removed safely to prevent infection. Equine owners can apply topical antibiotic creams like Flamazine to soothe uncomfortable areas on their horses before treating minor wounds.<br/></p><p>If your horse is experiencing photosensitization, it should be stabled during the day and only allowed out at night until severe symptoms have resolved. Because this condition can cause skin tissue to die off, your veterinarian may recommend corticosteroid injections along with preventing flies from affecting your horse.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Sunburn </h2><p>In most cases of sunburn, your horse can recover without much intervention. Limiting its exposure to the sun is key, as an already burned horse can experience more severe burns if allowed in direct sunlight before healing completely. The prognosis for horses with liver disease leading to photosensitivity will depend upon their specific condition, which a veterinarian can determine. Extreme cases of photosensitization can be fatal when a horse undergoes excessive loss of healthy skin tissuesso owners should utilize all available treatment methods to allow for a safe recovery. Thankfully, most horses with photosensitivity issues can return to a healthy state after treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Sunburn </h2><h3>Avoid Peak Daylight </h3><p><br/>Preventing sunburn most often means keeping them out of the sun when it's at its strongest. It's important to provide a shady place such as a line of trees or run-in shelter. Some people choose to . This is a strategy used to prevent show horses from getting sun-bleached coats.</p><h3>Apply Sunscreen </h3><p>Baby formula sunblock can be used to protect your horse's vulnerable areas. Your horse will have its head down to graze, so the product will wipe off quickly and need to be reapplied frequently. Products made specifically for horses are brightly colored so owners can see when they've worn off. This might not be the best idea if you're heading to the show ring, however. Inexpensive zinc oxide paste is useful in your equine first aid kit as both sunblock and to help heal any previously irritated skin.</p><h3>Fly Sheets and Masks </h3><p>Fly sheets and masks can help prevent sunburn on your horse. A full mask such as the Absorbine Fly Shield covers your horse from the top of its nose to its ear tips. Pale-colored fly and sun sheets give horses a little protection over their backs. Because these sheets are made with mesh (however, they shouldn't be considered total protection, as some sun rays will get through). Be sure that sheets fit well. A poorly fitting sheet can be irritating, especially over the shoulders and withers.</p>",921
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/internal-horse-parasites-1885867,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Internal Horse Parasites</h1>,"<h1>Internal Horse Parasites</h1><h2>Internal Parasites That Can Affect Your Horse</h2><p>Pixabay</p><p>Mosquitoes and face flies are obvious external pests that your horse has to deal with, but there are unseen internal pests that can profoundly affect your horse's well being. Internal parasites can do significant damage to your horse's internal organs. They steal nutrients from the food the horse eats and can cause havoc with the intestinal wall, cause diarrhea and weight loss, and can cause clots in the blood vessels carrying nutrients to the intestines.</p><p>If a horse is otherwise healthy and well-fed, a moderate parasite load might not be a problem. In fact, having some intestinal parasites is normal for a horse. However, if a horse is weak, sick, young, very old, or has other health problems, internal parasites can add to the health issues. Severe intestinal parasitism leads to signs of malnutrition such as a distended belly, weight loss,dull or frizzy hair coat, dull attitude, and diarrhea.</p><p>It is common for horses to harbor several different types of intestinal parasites at the same time. Good pasture management and a regular parasite management program can prevent severe parasitic infections. Here are the most common types of equine intestinal parasites.</p><h2>Strongyles </h2><p>This is a class of equine parasites and can be further divided into large and small strongyles.</p><p>Large strongyles, sometimes called ""bloodworms"" or ""redworms,"" are likely the most dangerous equine intestinal parasite because they can cause the most damage. Larvae of these parasites sit on blades of grass where a horse can easily ingest them. After the larvae are ingested, they burrow through the lining of the digestive tract and migrate through the blood vessels that supply the intestines. The larvae stay in these blood vessels for a few months, further developing into adult parasites. Once adults, the parasites migrate back to the intestine where they attach to the wall and release eggs which the horse passes in manure, to reinfect the pasture and start the life cycle over again.</p><p>Larvae migrating in the intestinal blood vessels can damage the vessels, cause bleeding and clots, arterial damage, and serious arterial blockages which can even lead to death.</p><p>Small strongyles are generally thought not to be as pathogenic, however, over the past few decades, researchers have been documenting cases of resistance in these parasites to commonly used dewormers. Small strongyles have the ability to encyst in the wall of the intestine. This makes it harder for deworming drugs to kill them and is, therefore, a handy survival mechanism for this parasite. Typically this parasite will encyst over the winter and when spring arrives, the worms will emerge from the cysts in large numbers. This causes severe irritation to the lining of the intestine and can result in diarrhea and colic in the horse.</p><h2>Roundworms or Ascarids </h2><p>Ascarids are long, round, pale gray worms that can grow up to a foot long. They live in the small intestine of horses. Because of their large size, they can cause impaction colic. These parasites can wreak havoc in foals especially, causing themto appear malnutritioned, with a potbelly appearance and poor hair coat. As a horse matures, it tends to build a natural immunity to this particular type of parasite.</p><h2>Pinworms </h2><p>If you see your horse scratching the base of its tail on a tree or fence post, suspect pinworms. Pinworms live in the large intestine and lay their eggs around the anus. Horse pinworms are not the same as human pinworms, so no need to worry about you or other pets becoming infected. Considered the most benign of the equine intestinal parasites, pinworms are easily treated with routine deworming products. The most harm they do is the resultant bald tail from the horse scratching.</p><h2>Lungworm </h2><p>These worms live within the horse's lungs. Lungworms cause irritation in the bronchial tubes that can lead to coughing. Severe infections may result in bronchitis, secondary bacterial infection, and pneumonia. If a horse has a cough that does not seem to be associated with another sickness or dusty feed, your veterinarian may suspect lungworm. This parasite is most often found in donkeys and mules, but horses can be infected if they share a pasture.</p><h2>Tapeworms </h2><h2>Bots </h2><p>Bots are not an intestinal parasite but rather a fly. Botflies lay eggs on your horse's front legs. The eggs are itchy and irritating and when the horse scratches himself, he ingests the eggs. Once swallowed, the eggs hatch and the larvae attach themselves to the lining of the horse's stomach where they can cause woulds and ulcerations. After a period of time, the larvae develop further and then release themselves from the stomach lining and are passed in the horse's manure. Once on the ground, the larvae burrow and further pupate into adult flies to restart the life cycle. In general, bot larvae are not harmful in small numbers. Horse owners can purchase bot fly knives at the tack store; these metal grooming instruments are used to scrape bot fly eggs off the inside of a horse's front legs to prevent ingestion.</p><h2>Threadworms </h2><p>Their names suggest these are small threadlike worms about 5/16 of an inch long. Threadworms enter the horse either by ingestion or by penetrating the skin. These worms are mostly a problem only in young foals. Owners of pregnant mares may consider treating the mare for threadworms before she foals. Threadworms may be passed from mare to foal through the mare's milk. The worms can cause damage to the horse's lung tissue, the lining of the digestive system and cause skin irritation. Foals with severe infestation may suffer from diarrhea, which may not respond to treatment, and dehydration. As the foal ages, it develops natural immunity to this parasite, which is rarely a health issue in older horses.</p>",965
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/girth-galls-and-saddle-sores-1886439,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Girth Galls and Saddle Sores</h1>,"<h1>Girth Galls and Saddle Sores</h1><p>Girth galls and saddle sores can occur for a number of reasons. Most are minor, but if left untreated, they can cause injury, scarring, and discomfort. Here's how to identify, treat, and prevent girth galls and saddle sores.</p><h2>Other Names </h2><p>Girth Galls, Saddle Sores, Blisters, Girth Sores, Pressure Sores, Saddle Galls, Harness Sores, Harness Galls</p><h2>Causes </h2><p>Girth galls, saddle sores, and sores that occur under a driving harness are caused by friction. They are similar to a blister that forms from wearing ill-fitting shoes. The sores can be caused by tack that is dirty with a build-up of grime and sweat that grinds the dirt into the horse's skin. Tack that is too tight or stiff and inflexible may cause chaffing that can lead to saddle sores. Occasionally, a foreign object like a burr, grass awn, or wood chip may become lodged between tack and horse, and cause chaffing. Some horses with sensitive skin are prone to saddle and girth sores and require extra care.</p><h2>Symptoms </h2><p>Saddle soars and girth galls may appear as slight rubs where just the hair is missing, or as very inflamed, open, blister-like wounds. The hair may not be rubbed off and the gall or sore may show as a swollen lump under the skinsomewhat like an unbroken blister on your foot. The lump can be tiny, or quite large. Girth galls commonly form just behind the elbow of the horse in the girth area, but can occur anywhere the girth or cinch lies. Very severe saddle sores can form deep 'holes' that can become infected. If left untreated, permanent damage and scarring to the skin and underlying muscle can occur. Saddle sores can form anywherethe saddle sits, although they most commonly form underneath the cantle area, or directly under the pommel area, near the loins and withers.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>On an open sore, sponge the sore and area around it with saline solution and cover it with a soothing ointment or cream. Many people like creams or lotions with calendula or aloe vera. Purple gentian spray may also be used. Please consult your veterinarian for the most appropriate recommendation for your horse. The main goal is to keep the area clean and the skin in good condition. Diaper or zinc oxide cream can also help to heal and soothe.</p><p>Galls or sores that appear as a swelling under the skin can be left. Whether open or closed, no equipment should be placed over the area until it is healed. It will be uncomfortable for your horse to wear a girth, harness, or saddle over an area that is already sore. (Your horse may express its discomfort by behaving badly.)</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Keep your tack clean. A build-up of sweat and grit may irritate a horse's skin and cause a sore. If you're trail riding, twigs, burrs, seeds, or other foreign objects can get caught between the horse and its tack. Leather and string girths or cinches can become stiff with age and cause uneven rubbing or pinching, so check the condition of your tack regularly.</p><p>Grooming is very important to prevent sores. For example, if your horse 'pecks' at their chest area to bite at flies, they may cover the area between their front legs with saliva and chewed hay bits. You have to clean this area carefully so there is no chance the dirt will buildup and potentially cause a sore. As dirt can become encrusted, use water and a sponge to wash the area before tacking up and put on a spritz of grooming spray to make the job easier next time.</p><p>Make sure your tack fits your horse. If your saddle constantly rubs back and forth as you ride, it could indicate a poorly fitting saddle. A too narrow or too wide girth or cinch could cause problems too.</p><p>Many people think it's a good thing to do up cinches, girths, and surcingles on harnesses really tight. This could cause pinching. You should be able to slip your hand between the girth and your horse. If your saddle pad or blanket bunches or shifts, try a different shape or material. Often a shifting pad or blanket indicates a poorly fitting saddle. A soft girth or cinch cover can prevent chaffing as well.</p><h2>Prevention for Horses With Sensitive Skin </h2><p>Sometimes, despite all efforts to prevent girth galls and saddle sores, you may find you can't seem to prevent them. This happens with horses that have particularly sensitive and thin skin. Often Thoroughbreds and other fine coated horses will have this problem.Just like you break in a new pair of stiff running shoes that are causing blisters on your feet, you will have to let your horse get used to its tack. Some people suggest washing the blister prone areas with saltwater to toughen up the skin. Another strategy is to increase the time the horse is ridden or driven gradually, so the skin has a chance to toughen up.</p><p>Fleecy girth or cinch covers can be purchased to put a soft barrier between horse and tack. Pads can help saddles sit better, but it's a bit like wearing thick socks in new shoes: the pad may relieve the problem in the short term. However, it's important for the saddle to fit the specific horse, or it may need to be re-stuffed if it's an English saddle.</p>",904
29,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hind-leg-problems-in-horses-1886457,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Hind Leg Problems in Horses: Causes and Treatment</h1>,"<h1>Hind Leg Problems in Horses: Causes and Treatment</h1><h2>Curbs, Thoroughpins, Spavins, and More</h2><p>Before learning about some of the most common hind leg problems horses can develop, it's helpful to understand a little about the underlying structures of the leg and how it should function normally.</p><p>The stifle is the joint lying under the heavy muscle at the top of the back leg where the leg almost meets the belly. It is roughly equivalent to a human knee. (A horse's actual knee is more like our wrist joint.) There are several ligaments that control how the stifle moves and these are attached to some very strong muscles that run upward along the horse's femur and downwards along the tibia. Like all joints in the horse's body, this joint is surrounded by a lubricating pad of nutrient-rich joint fluid which helps as a lubricant to keep the joint bending smoothly. Along with this fluid, the menisci (a thick pad of cartilage) acts as a shock absorber for the joint.</p><p>Muscles, tendons, and ligaments run along the long tibia and smaller fibula to the hock joint. The hock joint is another hinge-like joint about halfway down the horse's back leg. The small bone that forms the point of the hock is actually similar to the human heel bone. Six small bones make up this joint, and it is often the site of strain and wear and a common location for arthritis.</p><p>There is no muscle below the hock joint which is why the canon bone and splint bonefeel hard, with little cushioning. It's also why this area is susceptible to injury, with only ligaments and tendons running down to the pastern joint.</p><h2>Stringhalt </h2><p>Stringhalt is the over-flexing of one or both back legs. It looks as if the horse is taking very high steps with the back legs. The horse will snap the hoof upwards and then stomp down. The flexing can be more subtle, however, appearing occasionally and can be more obvious when the horse is asked to step back or turn sharply.</p><p>There are different types of stringhalt. Australian stringhalt is thought to be caused by a toxic weed. False stringhalt may be caused by injury in the lower leg. The cause of unilateral and bilateral stringhalt is not known although it is suspected to be associated with conditions of the nervous system.</p><p>Treatment sometimes includes removing a small section of the tendon. Sometimes stringhalt improves on its own, sometimes it will get worse, and some horses will improve and then relapse. Many horses improve after being worked lightly and will be sound enough to be ridden.</p><h2>Bog Spavins </h2><p>Bog spavins are caused by wear on the hock joint or an impact on the joint causing injury, like a kick. Conformation problems and mineral deficiencies may also cause bog spavins. Bog spavins feel like a spongy, soft swelling around the hock. If they are caused by an impact injury, only one hock will be affected. If both are involved, the bog spavin is probably caused by a conformation fault that places strain on both hock joints.</p><p>Bog spavins can be unsightly when large, but many horses perform well despite them. If the strain causing the spavin causes undue wear on the joint, pain and lameness can occur. The excess fluid that causes the spavin can be drained by a veterinarian but may reoccur.</p><h2>Bone Spavins </h2><p>Bone spavins are proliferative bone growth on the hock caused by joint strain, repeated concussion on hard surfaces, and confirmation problems. Horses like jumpersand reiners are susceptible to bone spavins. The hock joint is made of several bones and one or more of these bones can become affected.</p><p>As hock flexibility is decreased, the horse may drag its hind toes and the stride is shortened. This causes the horse pain and can result in arthritis. Most treatments are of minimal effectiveness. Eventually, the bones will fuse. Horses will be sound but corrective shoeing may be required.</p><h2>Jack Spavins </h2><p>Jack spavins are bone spavins that appear on the inside of the hock joint. The bony growth pushes against a tendon, which causes pain and makes the horse step short, dragging the toe of its back hoof.</p><h2>Thoroughpins </h2><p>Thoroughpins are caused when the tendon in the upper rear hock area becomes inflamed. The swelling is visible as a bulge on either side of the top of the hock joint. (A bog spavin sits slightly lower.) Treatments are aimed at decreasing the swelling. Rest,cold hosing, topical sweats, and draining are some of the treatments that may help.</p><h2>Capped Hocks </h2><p>Capped hocks are large fluid-filled swellings on the points of the hock. They can be caused by impacts and from lying on a hard floor. Thicker bedding may help alleviate the problem. Similar swellings can occur on the horse's elbows. The horse is unlikely to be lame. The swelling can become quite pronounced. Treatments include cold hosing, steroids, and drainage. Most resolve themselves to some extent without treatment and they are unlikely to affect a horse's performance.</p><h2>Curbs </h2><p>Curbs are inflammations of the upper hind area of the rear cannon bone. They are caused by an impact, such as a kick, that strains the plantar tarsal ligament. Slight lameness may accompany the swelling. Cold packs and rest are recommended for acute cases. Some fluid may remain but a horse with curb can usually heal well with no lingering lameness.</p>",903
30,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horse-skin-problems-1886458,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>How to Identify Horse Skin Diseases and Conditions</h1>,"<h1>How to Identify Horse Skin Diseases and Conditions</h1><p>It's almost inevitable that your horse will have some sort of minor skin problem during its lifetime. There are a range of common skin conditions that affect horses. Read on to find out more.</p><h2>Rain Scald or Rain Rot </h2><p>0</p><p>Sometimes a run of damp, rainy weather is all it takes for a horse to develop rain rot or rain scald, also known as dermatophilosis. This is a minor bacterial infection of the skin that occurs frequently in wet, humid weather. This weather causes a specific species of bacterium to proliferate and colonize weak areas in your horse's skin. As a result, the hair on your horse's back and rump will look like paintbrushes -- clumps of elevated hair tufts that fall out when you pick them, leaving raw pink skin underneath.</p><p>Most cases of rain rot will heal on their own with good hygiene and adequate drying time. You may have to keep your horse indoors for a period of time to allow the skin to dry and heal. More severe cases may make your horse's skin tender and require an anti-bacterial, drying shampoo. Ask your veterinarian for advice if you think your horse's rain rot is chronic or causing him to be uncomfortable.</p><h2>Ringworm</h2><p>Ringworm isn't caused by a worm. Instead it's a fungal infection and is zoonotic, meaning you can catch it from your horse. This infection makes your horse's skin appear scaly and scabby. Although sometimes the lesions are in a ring, they are not always in this shape. This condition is highly contagious and the fungus can remain in the environment for a long time.</p><p>Although most cases of ringworm will heal on their own, this can take several weeks to months. This usually is too long a period to wait due to how contagious and zoonotic this infection is. Instead, many vets will advise special topical treatments to help speed up the healing process. Along with treating the horse, all tack, grooming equipment, halters, blankets, and other equipment will need to be carefully sanitized. Handle horses with ringworm with disposable latex gloves. Be sure to carefully wash your hands and clothes after contact.</p><h2>Mange</h2><p>Mange is a skin condition caused by microscopic mites. These mitesburrow or bite into the horse's skin and cause intense itching. Very young horses, senior horses, and horses in poor condition are more likely to be affected by mange. There are a few different types of mange, and they show up on the horse's skin in slightly different ways.</p><h2>Lice</h2><p>G. F. Ferris. San Francisco / Pacific Coast Entomological Society, 1951</p><p>A few specific species of lice live on horses. Lice are species-specific, meaning horse lice only infest horses, human lice only infest humans, etc. This means you will not get infested from lice from your horse. Most lice infestations in horses occur on animals that are thin, stressed, and in poor health. Lice make horses extremely itchy. Severe infestations can make a horse anemic and weak. If your veterinarian diagnoses a lice infestation, she will likely treat your horse with a dewormer that is also effective against ectoparasites.</p><h2>Allergic Dermatitis </h2><p>Some horses have sensitive skin and may break with hives or rashes after contact with varioussubstances, including plant particles and other substances in the air, or with food. Allergic dermatitis can show up on any part of the horse's body. Your and your veterinarian may have to do some detective work to figure out what is causing your horse's skin reaction. The cure may be removal of the cause and perhaps some anti-histamines if the skin irritation is really uncomfortable.</p><h2>Greasy Heel or Pastern Dermatitis</h2><p>Greasy heel, also known as mud fever or pastern dermatitis, is a generalized dermatitis that causes the skin around a horse's ankle to appear greasy. As the condition progresses, the skin can become inflamed, swollen, and hot to touch with scabs. Some horses will be tender and some become lame. The most common treatment is to keep the horse's feet dry and clean and apply antiseptic washes and ointment to the affected areas.</p><h2>Vitiligo </h2><p>Vitiligo</p><p>While a horse with flashy white markings is undeniably eye-catching, white markings that suddenly appear around eyes and other thin-skinned areas on the horse leave many horse owners worrying, but this mainly a cosmetic issue. Caused by an auto-immune response where the horse's own pigment-producing cells die, this condition is not painful for the horse and not contagious. There is no treatment.</p><h2>Summer Itch or Sweet Itch in Horses </h2><p>Sweet itch is the common term for a skin allergy to biting midges, sometimes called no-see-ums. Some horses are allergic to the saliva of these tiny biting insects and their skin over-reacts, causes the horse to be extremely itchy and miserable. The best treatment for this condition is to prevent midge bites by using insect repellents and fly sheets on your horse during seasons when these insects are out. Your veterinarian may also prescribe antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine and cetirizine.</p>",850

Blocksdorf</p><p>Are you finding strange lumps of hay that look a bit like bird's nests gone awry in your horse's stall or paddock? These lumps are called quids and mean it's time to call your veterinarian or equine dentist.A horse that quids isn't swallowing its food properly and that can cause it to lose condition as it doesn't get the nutrition it needs. Another word for this is cudding as the wad of hay or grass looks like the cuds that cows regurgitate to chew after grazing.</p><h2>Symptoms </h2><p>Just looking at your horse, it may not be apparent that there is a problem in its mouth. A sharp eye may be able to spot muscle imbalances and irregularities in the way the horse chews. However, most people will first notice a horse is quidding when they find the partially chewed boluses of hay strewn around the feeder or see the horse spilling large quantities of grain out of its mouth when it eats. Those soggy lumps of mashed hay are a sure sign that something is going on in your horse's mouth that needs the attention of a veterinarian or equine dentist. You might also notice your horse has very bad breath if the quidding is caused by an infection somewhere in the horse's mouth. Horses that quid are also at risk of choke, so it's important to look after this problem as soon as you notice it.</p><h2>Causes </h2><p>There are different causes why horses are unable to chew properly and start to quid. The most common reason is that the horse has dental problems. Overgrown or fractured teeth, infected gums, teeth with sharp edges, or missing teeth can impair the way the horse chews. Overgrown, broken, or sharp teeth may cause the horse to lacerate the inside of its cheek or tongue when it chews. As a result, it might not completely chew some food because of the pain.</p><p>Another cause of quidding is that the horse may have a foreign object wedged somewhere in its mouth, and this too can cause the horse to only partially chew its food. A horse that has a jaw injury may not be able to chew properly. And, paralysis, such as what can be caused by a viral disease such as EEE may also prevent a horse from being able to chew properly.</p><h2>Diagnoses </h2><p>Finding wet lumps of partially chewed hay or grass is a sure sign that something is going on in your horse's mouth that needs attention. A horse that quids may also drool out a lot of its grain because it's unable to grind the grain with its teeth.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>A veterinarian or equine dentist can float any long or sharp teeth, extract broken or infected ones, or treat an infection in your horse's mouth. This may be all it takes to stop the quidding. If the horse has severe or longstanding dental problems, it may take more than one floating to get its mouth back into shape.</p><p>Because the horse has been compensating for the pain in its mouth, it could take a while beforeit redevelops its facial muscles and feels comfortable enough to chew its food more thoroughly. Some horses may continue to quid out of habit.</p><p>If dental work isn't needed or doesn't stop the quidding, a veterinarian can help you determine if a jaw injury such as a dislocation or fracture is causing the problem. Chances are if your horse has a neurological disease that prevents it from eating properly, you'll already be treating it for that, and once the horse has recovered, the quidding should go away too. For older horses that have very worn or missing teeth, there may be no actual treatment beyond making sure the horse is fed fodder and concentrates that are very easy for it to chew and swallow. This might include soaking the feed or feeding mashes that aren't hard to chew.</p><p>While you are waiting for the vet or dentist to treat your horse, be sure to provide it with easy to chew feed. This may include water-soaked chopped hay or hay cubes and beet pulp. Concentrates should be easy to chewno large pelleted feed, and your horse may be able to consume it more easily if it's wetted. If a broken tooth or infection is causing the problem, offering slightly warmed water may help your horse drink more comfortably.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Regular dental care is important throughout your horse's life. Most horses need to have their teeth floated at least once a year. As your horse ages, you will have to modify its feed, perhaps offering fodder and concentrates that are easier to chew, swallow and digest. Horse with a severe loose tooth or worn teeth will benefit from having their feed wetted. To avoid viral and neurological problems, regular vaccinations are essential.</p>",807

Slobbers is caused by Rhizoctonia leguminicola, thefungusfound on vegetation that produces the drool-causing slaframine compound. Slobbers symptoms are usually limited to theslobberingitself, but complications may arise if the condition goes untreated. Slobbers should go away on its own and can be prevented by keeping your horse away from vegetation that may be infected with the fungus. The only necessary treatment for slobbers is changing your horse's food source.</p><h2>What Is Slobbers? </h2><p>Slobbers, or slaframine poisoning, is the excessive drooling that happens to a horse after ingesting Rhizoctonia leguminicola, the fungus that produces slaframine. This fungus is most commonly seen in red clover, white clover, alsike clover, and alfalfa. The slaframine activates the salivary glands, causing the horse to hyper-salivate. Although non-life-threatening, the horse's hypersalivation can last several hours to several days. Effects begin within hours of the horse ingesting the infected plant but can be easily resolved with the plant's removal or the horse's removal from the area where the plant grows.<br/></p><h2>Symptoms of Slobbers in Horses </h2><p>While the symptoms of slobbers are generally mild, prolonged exposure to slaframine can cause your horse to feel discomfort or lead to complications. Symptoms will become apparent within hours or days of ingestion, so treat your horse swiftly to prevent further discomfort. Drooling is symptomatic of several serious diseases in horses, so take your horse to the vet for a definitive diagnosis.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Excessive Salivation </h3><p>Excessive salivation is the clearest (and sometimes only) indicator that your horse has slobbers. This will probably look like thick drool hanging from your horse's mouth throughout the day. Excess saliva is hard to ignore, so if you notice it, eliminate the foliage around your horse that may contain slaframine. If the excessive salivation does not subside, take your horse to the vet.</p><h3>Colic, Diarrhea, and Bloating </h3><p>If your horse's slaframine poisoning is neglected, it may become more severe and lead to symptoms beyond drooling. These symptoms include colic, diarrhea, and bloating.<br/></p><h3>Choking </h3><p>A horse can choke or suffocate on its excess saliva in some cases. Although rare, it is necessary to address your horse's slobbers before potentially life-threatening complications present.</p><h2>Causes of Slobbers </h2><p>Fortunately, the causes of slobbers are limited and straightforward. Recognizing the causes will help to prevent your horse from developing slobbers.</p><h2>Diagnosing Slobbers in Horses </h2><p>A slobbers diagnosis begins with an examination of the suspected infected plant. With a microscope or the naked eye, your vet can examine your horse's food source for signs of Rhizoctonia leguminicola fungus. This examination can be done using cultures and chromatography on hay thought to contain slaframine. Additionally, swabs from a horse's mouth or milk may be examined. A diagnosis will be made by correlating your horse's symptoms and exposure to affected fungi and hay.<br/></p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>No treatment for slobbers is necessary except for changing the horse's food and limiting its access to pastures that contain infected fungi. Mowing the pasture can help control infected plants and promote healthy regrowth. Since the growth of the black patch fungus is dependent on weather, some years will be worse for slobbers than others. It may be harder to detect and eradicate affected pieces in the hay. The toxicity of the fungus will decrease as hay ages, so it may be a matter of waiting several months before feeding the existing hay again. In the meantime, hay replacement is best.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Slobbers </h2><p>Most horses recover quickly without treatment so long as access to the infected plant is restricted. If your horse's slobbers is untreated for a long time and complications develop, visit your vet for an expert opinion.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Slobbers </h2><p>There's very little that you can do to prevent slobbers other than limiting access to vulnerable vegetation during cold, wet weather. It isn't practical to try to remove alfalfa and clovers entirely from your pastures, as they make a valuable contribution to your horse's nutrition. Monitor your horse's health and pay attention to what it eats year-round.</p><p>If your horse is excessively salivating, it has likely been ingesting slaframine, a compound found in vegetation infected with fungus. Slaframine, or ""slobbers,"" will cause your horse to drool.</p><p>Slobbers is typically not harmful. As with any health abnormality, treat your horse swiftly to prevent further complications.</p><p>The compound slaframine is commonly found on plants like red clover, white clover, alsike clover, alfalfa, and hay.</p>",742
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lice-on-horses-1886445,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Lice in Horses</h1>,"<h1>Lice in Horses</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Lice are widespread parasitic pests that can infest many animals' coats, including horses. They typically target horses that live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions or those that are stressed for any number of reasons. There are two species of lice and the distinction is how they feed: one species feeds through biting and chewing on hair and dead skin, while the other feeds through sucking the blood of the host animal. Both cause extreme itching and skin damage due to horses scratching their irritated skin.</p><h2>What Are Lice? </h2><p>Lice are tiny parasitic insects that live in the hair coat of horses and other mammals. Lice infestations can be an indication of poor care and/or poor nutrition, but they occasionally occur for no apparent reason. They can be common in stables where close quarters and shared equipment make the spread of lice easy.<br/></p><p>The two species of lice that impact horses are , the blood-sucking type, and , the skin biting type.</p><h2>Symptoms of Lice in Horses </h2><p>Lice like to breed in horses' thick winter coats, but they can be present year-round. They will migrate all over the horse's body, including the mane and tail. Wherever they are, they cause horses a lot of discomfort.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>A lice-infested horse will be intensely itchy, especially around the base of the tail, mane, and head. The lice lay eggs called nits in the horse's hair coat and mane. These nits will hatch into nymphs that mature into egg-laying adults. Both nymphs and adults will cause the itching associated with lice. As the horse tries to relieve the itching by rubbing itself on fences, trees, or stall walls, it can rub raw patches on its skin.</p><p>A horse can be so uncomfortable that it will appear listless or colicky and become very run down. Depending on the type of lice, the parasites will either suck the horse's blood or feed off of dead skin cells, both of which are itchy. If the horse is infested with the sucking louse, blood loss may be severe enough to cause anemia, which will make the horse feel lethargic.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Lice </h2><p>Typically, horses that are underweight or in poorer condition are more susceptible to lice infestations. Healthy horses have a stronger immune system and can usually fight off an infestation unless they are housed in stressed or poor conditions.</p><h2>Diagnosing Lice in Horses </h2><p>Lice are generally diagnosed based on symptoms and the presence of nits (eggs), which are visible to the naked eye. If no nits are seen, then a veterinarian may also perform a skin scraping to check for parasites under a microscope because mange can cause similar symptoms.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The first step is to treat the horse with either a topical de-lousing powder or medication. Common treatments are permethrin-based dust, shampoos, or rinses. Be cautious when applying treatment to irritated skin because it may sting.</p><p>When applying any medication powder, take care not to inhale it, and to wash up after you apply it. Wear gloves and a dust mask to avoid contact with the chemicals.</p><p>All equipment that could carry lice or nits must be washed as well. Blankets and washable equipment can be laundered and dried with high heat, or even boiled.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses with Lice </h2><p>With help and treatment, a horse is likely to recover from lice without much concern. The bigger challenge is making sure your horse is healthy and has comfortable living conditions to reduce stress and the likelihood of lice infestations.</p><p>Lice are species-specific, meaning that bird lice generally don't live on people or dogs, and horse lice don't typically infect people. Neither you nor your other pets are likely to get lice from your horse. The lice are transferred from horse to horse by direct contact or through shared brushes, blankets, and equipment.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Lice </h2><p>The best way to ward off lice is to keep your horse in spacious, sanitary conditions and feed it a nutritious diet.</p><p>If you bring a new horse home, it should be kept separate from other horses to prevent any problems, including lice, to the resident herd. In a busy barn, it's a good idea that each horse has its own brushes and equipment because shared grooming tools and blankets can spread many skin problems like lice, ringworm, and mange.</p>",744

The most common symptom isstiffnessandlockjaw, as well asfever. Tetanus is diagnosed through a physical examination and sometimes a blood test to identify the presence of theCtoxin. Treatment usually involves antibiotics and antitoxins, but the prognosis is generally poor. Tetanus is best prevented through regular vaccination and maintaining a clean and safe stall for your horse.</p><h2>What Is Tetanus? </h2><p>Tetanus is a potentially fatal nervous system disease caused by the bacteria toxin C. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw and leads to muscle spasms, particularly in the jaw and neck. The toxin multiplies rapidly and does not need oxygen to live. The toxin can survive for a long time and usually enters the body through a puncture wound, but can also be ingested. Horses are particularly susceptible to tetanus and will often procure wounds on the sole of the foot.</p><h2>Symptoms of Tetanus in Horses </h2><p>It may take ten days to two weeks for symptoms of tetanus to appear. Once you notice symptoms, visit your veterinarian immediately.<br/><br/></p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The most common symptom of a tetanus infection is stiffness in the head andneck, but the hindquarters and wound site may be affected first. The stiffness will spread to the jaw, making it difficult or impossible for a horse to open its mouth. The nostrils may be flared as well. As tetanus progresses, violent spasms will become more intense and easily triggered and your horse will become increasingly agitated. As the days go on, the horse will become stiffer, taking on a '""sawhorse"" stance with its head and tail arched downward. Fever will then develop, accompanied by sweating, increased pulse, heightened respiration rate, and congestion.</p><h2>Causes of Tetanus </h2><p>Horses can contract tetanus in two ways.</p><h3>Diagnosing Tetanus in Horses </h3><p>A vet will diagnose tetanus in a horse by examining physical symptoms, medical history, and sometimes with a blood test to confirm the presence of the tetanus-causing toxin. A vet can usually make a diagnosis if your horse is exhibiting distinctive signs of tetanus, such as a locked jaw, in conjunction with a puncture wound.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment of tetanus in horses begins with thoroughly cleaning the wound and surrounding area. Your vet will prescribe large amounts of antibiotics and antitoxins to stop the bacteria from multiplying further. If a horse has already been vaccinated against tetanus, your vet may administer an additional dose.</p><p>After the tetanus infection has been treated, your vet will advise palliative care methods. For horses still able to eat, You should place food and water at a height that is easy for the horse to reach, and you should keep your horse in a secluded, dark stall to avoid over-stimulation in its already agitated state. If the horse cannot stand, it may be put in a sling to keep it on its feet. Your vet may also prescribe muscle relaxants, sedatives, and IV fluids.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Tetanus </h2><p>The prognosis for horses with tetanus is poor, and most will die or be euthanized. When detected early, treatment can be effective, but in many cases, by the time the horse receives a diagnosis, it's too late. The prognosis is more optimistic for horses who can still stand, and they will improve within two to six weeks, but 80% of horses will die.</p><h2>How to Prevent Tetanus </h2><p>Tetanus is easily prevented in horses. Your horse should be vaccinated against tetanus every two years, but most horse-owners vaccinate yearly. Foals need to be vaccinated after about four months, and if the mare is vaccinated, the foal will receive some protection from the colostrum. In addition to vaccinations, you should make sure your horse's living space is clean and keep sharp objects off of the ground.</p><p>Tetanus in horses is often fatal due to late detection. If you notice any symptoms of stiffness in your horse, visit the vet right away.</p><p>There is a very effective vaccine for tetanus in horses that is included in its general inoculations as a foal. The vaccine should be re-administered every other year.</p><p>Your horse can contract tetanus through ingesting the bacteria in contaminated soil, manure, or dust. A puncture wound is not necessary to the development of the infection.</p>",704
35,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horses-with-a-broken-leg-1886850,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Diseases & Conditions,<h1>Why Horses With Broken Legs Are Often Euthanized</h1>,"<h1>Why Horses With Broken Legs Are Often Euthanized</h1><p>CasaraGuru / iStock</p><p>It wasn't that long ago that if a horse broke a leg, euthanasia was the only course of action. Breaks are most commonly heard of in racehorses, but any horse can break a bone in its leg.</p><p>While euthanasia is often still the main option, advances in veterinary technologies and techniques mean that some horses can be saved, and may even be able to return to their work in some capacity. But saving every horse with a fracture is still a long way off. Here's why.</p><h2>When a Human Breaks a Leg </h2><p>If a human breaks a leg, the worst-case scenario might be surgery, possibly to place an implant (plates, pins, screws, etc.) to hold the bone together, a cast, and weeks or months of allowing the bone to heal, followed by physiotherapy. Our bodies are relatively light compared to a horse's, and our leg bones are proportionately larger for our weight, in comparison to a horse's.</p><p>We also know that we must stay off of the injured legso that the fracture can mend properly, without stressing or damaging the healing bone. Most people, no matter how complicated their fracture, will probably survive their fractureunless there is some sort of unusual complication.</p><h2>When a Horse Breaks a Leg </h2><p>Unlike humans, horses have heavy bodies and light leg bones. This is the way we've developed many breeds, especially the Thoroughbreds. When bones break, they may often shatter. And it's almost impossible to surgically reconstruct the fractured leg.</p><p>While humans have some large muscles and a bit of tissue below the knee that helps to stabilize a broken bone, along with a cast, a horse has very little muscleand hardly any other tissue besides tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and some nerves below the knee.</p><p>The lack of muscle and other tissue means that even with a cast, the broken bone has little to support it. And, it's much harder to prevent a horse from using its broken leg to bear weight.Horses stand most of the time, and a horse is likely to instinctively flee when it's startled, instead of reasoning that it must keep weight off of its fractured leg. This makes the chances of re-injury high.</p><h2>Horses' Legs Bear a Lot of Stress </h2><p>Horses put a huge amount of stress on their legs, especially when galloping and jumping. And, there are several bones below the knee and hock. Some of the bones are within the hoof, and when they shatter, they are far more difficult to stabilize and heal.</p><p>Over half of the horse's weight is borne on the front legs, so those bones and joints, in particular, endure a lot of stress. Even if a horse's bones are healing, other complications can set in, such as static laminitis, making it difficult for the horse to fully recover without ongoing severe pain.</p><h2>Fractures That Can and Can't Be Repaired </h2><p>The less complicated the fracture, the more likely the horse will recover. Greenstick and stress fractures are incomplete fractures, and these can usually be treated successfully. Simple fractures, where there is one clean break, are more likely to heal successfully than shattered bones (or comminuted fractures).</p><p>Compound fractures, where a broken bone penetrates the skin, have a much poorer prognosis and are less likely to heal successfully without complication. Such cases are likely to be euthanized, particularly if the blood supply to the leg has been compromised. Fractures that involve joints such as the pasterns, are often irreparable. Fractures that occur above the knee are also difficult to repair.</p><h2>Signs of a Horse With a Broken Leg </h2><p>A horse that has fractured a leg will be in obvious distress. It will not want to bear weight on the leg and there will be swelling. The leg may appear to be crooked, or a bone may even appear to protrude through the skin.</p><p>As soon as possible, have a veterinarian examine the horse. Continued movement can worsen the fracture or cause additional injury to the horse, so it must be kept as still as possible. If the veterinarian determines the fracture can be repaired, the horse may be transported to a veterinary hospital.</p>",692

A rig's testes arelocated inside its body, near the inguinal canal or abdominal cavity. Some rigs arefertilewhile others are not, but all cryptorchids produce testosterone, leading tostallion-like behavior, even without testes. Diagnosing cryptorchidism is straightforward and should be done by a veterinarian. Cryptorchidism is usually inherited, although it has yet to be successfully genetically mapped. Breeds like quarter horses, saddlebreds, Percherons, and ponies are more susceptible to cryptorchidism than others. Treatment is generally highly effective with a favorable prognosis, but ahighly specialized veterinary surgeonneeds to perform the surgery.</p><h2>What Is Cryptorchidism? </h2><p>Cryptorchidism is a condition in horses that causes one or both testes to not descend fully into the scrotum. A cryptorchid horse's testes may be located under the skin near the inguinal canal, within the canal, or outside the abdominal cavity. Horses with one descended testis are usually fertile, while one with neither testis dropped is usually infertile. Even though the testes don't descend, a horse will still have libido and aggressive male behavior because testosterone is being produced. Cryptorchid horses may also be referred to as rigs or riglings. Rigs are usually castrated at age three to remove the retained testicle because it can cause discomfort.</p><h2>Symptoms of Cryptorchidism in Horses </h2><p>One or two undescended testes are the only reliable sign of cryptorchidism in a horse.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Even if your horse doesn't appear to have testes or is infertile, testosterone is in its body. Your rig will display aggressive male behavior, regardless of fertility status or outward appearance of testicles. Your horse will likely still be fertile even if only one testicle is descended.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Cryptorchidism </h2><p>The cause of cryptorchidism in horses is not entirely understood, but there are thought to be several factors at play.</p><h2>Diagnosing Cryptorchidism in Horses </h2><p>To diagnose a horse with cryptorchidism, your vet will perform external palpation of the scrotum and internal palpation through the rectum. Your horse may also need an ultrasound to locate a testis within the abdomen or inguinal canal. Occasionally, a ridgling with two undescended testes may be mistaken for an already-castrated horse especially if the testes cannot be located by palpitation. If this is the case, Your vet will do blood work to evaluate testosterone levels. The horse may have to be tranquilized for this very invasive internal examination. Often, cryptorchidism goes unnoticed until it's time to geld acolt.</p><h2>Treatment & Prevention </h2><p>Castration is considered to be the best option for treating cryptorchidism in horses. Castrating a rig can prevent medical complications related to undescended testes as well as eliminate aggressive, stallion-like behavior. This can either be done in a standard, surgical fashion or laparoscopically.</p><p>While the surgery is not invasive, a horse's testicular anatomy is very complex and requires highly specialized equipment and training. The higher the testes are in the abdomen, the more complicated the surgery will be. Veterinary clinics offering these surgeries may not be readily available to all horse owners.</p><p>There is little that can be done to prevent cryptorchidism. Because it is hereditary in most cases, cryptorchids that are capable of reproduction should be castrated and not be bred.</p><h2>Prognosis for Horses With Cryptorchidism </h2><p>As with any castration, postoperative complications may arise. Hemorrhaging and inflammation can occur, in which case contact your vet. Rarely more severe complications can occur such as intestinal prolapse or infection of the spermatic cord. Typically treatment is successful, and the prognosis is good. After surgery, your horse will rest in its stall and be walked by hand with a gradual increase in exercise after 10 days to two weeks.<br/></p><p>If your horse has one of two testes descended, it is likely fertile. If neither of its testes has descended then it won't be able to reproduce.</p><p>Cryptorchidism itself is not dangerous, but retained testes could lead to medical complications like tumors. It's important that you castrate a horse with cryptorchidism.</p><p>While the surgery to castrate a horse's retained testes isn't particularly invasive, it requires a highly trained surgeon specializing in complex abdominal anatomy.</p>",688
37,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-groom-your-horse-1886027,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Grooming,<h1>How to Groom Your Horse</h1>,"<h1>How to Groom Your Horse</h1><p>Encourage a bond with your horse while grooming. Taking care of your horse's coat, hooves and hair provides an opportunity for you to check for injuries or irritations. Ideally, grooming should occur daily, but it's a must before and after riding. Grit beneath the saddle or girth or cinch will be uncomfortable for your horse and could cause saddle or girth sores.</p><h2>Preparing to Groom Your Horse </h2><p>Gather and arrange your grooming tools in a convenient, safe place. A wide bucket may be cheapest and easiest to put your brushes in, although there are lots of grooming boxes on the market that keep your tools organized and handy.</p><p>Don't set your bucket or box too close to your horse where he could knock it over, or where you might trip over it as you move around your horse. Tie the horse securely and safely with cross ties or with aquick-release knot.</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3>Clean Your Horse's or Pony's Hooves </h3><p>Slide your hand down the left foreleg. Gently squeeze the back of the leg along the tendons just above the pastern and say ""up,"" ""hoof,"" or whatever word your horse responds to.</p><p>Hold the hoof and with the hoof pick pry out any dirt, manure, or grit lodged in the frog or sole of the foot. Check for any injury and signs of thrush, grease heel, or other problems, and take note of any cracks in the wall of the hoof, so you can consult with your veterinarian or farrier as to what should be done. Gently place the foot back down on the ground and continue until all four feet are done.</p><h3>Curry Your Horse or Pony </h3><p>Starting on the left side, or ""offside,"" use your curry comb or grooming mitt to loosen the dirt in your horse's coat. Remove any mud, grit, dust, and other debris before trying to put a real shine on your horse's coat.</p><p>Curry in circular sweeps all over the horse's body, but be careful over the bony areas of the shoulders, hips, and legs. Many horses are sensitive about having their bellies and between the back legs brushed (although some love it). If your horse reacts by laying back his ears or swishing his tail in agitation, he is telling you that the brushing is too vigorous.</p><p>While currying, look for any skin lesions or wounds. If you find anything, assess the injury to decide if you want to treat it yourself or if you need a veterinarian.</p><h3>Comb out the Tangles </h3><p>A flowing, shiny mane and tail are a joy to behold. Get that full, healthy look by being gentle and patient as you groom your horse's mane or tail.</p><p>Start with a mane comb or brush at the bottom of the strands and brush downward in sections until you can smoothly comb from the top to the bottom. When brushing the tail, stand to one side and pull the tail gently over to you, making sure you are out of the way should the horse kick.</p><p>A grooming spray that detangles hair is nice to have, as it makes brushing out the long strands easier while cleaning, shining and protecting the hair. A grooming spray may also help prevent the hairs from tangling too much between groomings.</p><h3>Use the Body Brush to Whisk Away Dirt </h3><p>After currying the body to get rid of the coarser dirt, it's time to go to work with a body brush. This longer-bristled, stiff brush will get rid of what the curry comb missed.</p><p>With the body brush, whisk out the dirt brought to the surface. Start on one side and move around the horse brushing in sweeping strokes following the direction of the hair growth. Some people find the body brush is more useful for cleaning the legs than the curry comb. This is a good time to check for lesions and skin irritations on the legs, knees, and pasterns like small cuts and nicks, or perhaps even problems like grease heel.</p><h3>Use the Finishing Brush </h3><p>A finishing brush, which has shorter, softer bristles, helps to bring out the shine on your horse's coat and can be used on your horse's or pony's face if you don't have a special brush just for that.</p><p>Gently whisk away dust from the broader areas on your horse's face, ears, and throat. With sweeping strokes, whisk away any dust missed by the body brush. The finer bristles help smooth out the body hair and leave your horse looking more finished and glossy.</p><p>When you think you are done, apply a grooming spray. Depending on the type, these can provide sun protection and add shine to your horse's coat, but they aren't necessary.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you plan to ride after grooming, you must be aware that some grooming products may make the hair slippery and could cause your saddle to shift. Try to avoid application to the saddle area.</p><h3>Clean the Ears, Eyes, Muzzle, and Dock Area </h3><p>So far, you have cleaned up your horse's body, mane, and tailnow it's time for detailing. With a damp sponge or soft cloth, wipe around the horse's eyes and muzzle and clean away any dirt or chaff.You may prefer a soft cloth, as it can be more easily laundered between uses.</p><p>At this point, check your horse's eyes. A bit of tearing at the corner of the eye is not uncommon, but take note of excess tearing, redness, or swelling. Eye infections need to be treated promptly.</p><p>Check ears for lodged seed heads or dirt. Some horses are fussy about having their ears handled, so go slowly and be careful not to pinch or pull hairs. Eventually, your horse may come to love having its ears groomed. When you are done with the face, use the cloth to wipe around the dock and tail head.</p>",958

It is extremely itchy and irritating, and severe mite infestations can cause progressive skin lesions from mite damage and scratching. If left untreated, mange lesions can become widespread over a horse's body, leading to great discomfort and emaciation due to anorexia. Several topical and systemic treatments are available from equine veterinarians to treat this uncommon but potentially serious ailment.</p><h2>What Is Mange? </h2><p>Mange refers to an infestation of a horse's skin by various types of parasitic mites that feed by piercing the skin or burrowing in it, depending on the type of mite. There are four different types of mange in horses, including chorioptic (leg) mange, sarcoptic mange, psoroptic mange, and demodectic mange. Each type of mite causes irritation, but some are easier to eradicate than others. In addition to treatments that kill the mites, antibiotic therapy may be required to help a horse's skin heal.</p><p>For many years, mange in horses was a reportable disease, meaning the federal government had to be alerted if an infestation was diagnosed by a veterinarian. As of 2006, however, the condition was declared rare enough that it was no longer reportable in horses in the United States. It still exists, though, in a small number of cases each year. Very young horses, senior horses, and immunocompromised horses are more likely to be affected by mange than adult horses in top condition.</p><h2>Symptoms of Mange in Horses </h2><p>Signs of mange are usually evident shortly after infestation. Mange in horses is more common during the cooler months when horses' longer coats provide insulation and increased moisture that mites are drawn to.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Skin infested by mange mites will weep fluid, becoming dry, crusty, thickened, and red. In response to the biting and burrowing mites, a horse will be very itchy. To relieve the itch, the horse may kick, stomp, roll, bite itself, or rub itself on fences or trees, causing more skin damage.</p><p>If left untreated, the affected skin will become thickened and chronically inflamed, causing the horse to lose condition.</p><h2>Causes of Mange </h2><p>Mange is a skin condition caused by microscopic mites. Mites are eight-legged ectoparasites thatbite or burrow into the horse's skin and cause intense itching. Certain types of mites have a predilection toward certain places on the bodythe ear area, fetlock,pasterns, between the legs, or elsewhere on the body.<br/></p><h2>Diagnosing Mange in Horses </h2><p>A physical exam of affected skin may be the only diagnosis required by your veterinarian to determine a course of treatment. Depending on the location of the lesions, a vet may also perform a skin scraping to detect specific mite species under a microscope.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Once mites are identified, a horse may be treated with an acaracide wash and an oral parasite medication like ivermectin. The treatment may need to be repeated because mites may take several weeks to complete their life cycles.</p><p>Since the mites may persist for a short time on the horse's brushes, tack, and stable, all must be washed to prevent further spread. It's important to wear gloves during the treatment time and take care not to pass the mites on to other animals.</p><p>In a herd situation, all horses should be treated to completely eradicate the mites, and severe skin lesions may require antibiotic medication to cure secondary bacterial infections.</p><h2>Prognosis for a Horse With Mange </h2><p>Mange can spread easily from horse to horse by physical contact, and mange mites can live for short periods in warm, damp conditions such as saddle pads, blankets or tack, and other items the horse may come in contact with. If all horses and tack are treated for the duration of time recommended by a veterinarian, the mange problem should be eradicated, and the horse (or horses) will likely be free of the itchiness within a few weeks. More severe lesions may take longer to heal completely.</p><h2>How to Prevent Mange </h2><p>Keeping your horse in good health is the key to avoiding many problems. It is a good idea for each horse to have its own tack and brushes. Any new horses brought into a stable should be carefully examined and isolated if there is any health concern. If you suspect mange or any other skin problem, clean all tack and brushes with the appropriate spray or wash and practice good hygienegloves and handwashingto prevent spread.</p><h2>Types of Mange in Horses </h2><p>Chorioptic (leg) mange: Mites of the species cause chorioptic mange, also known in horses as leg mange. It is most commonly found in draft horses with long feathering hair on their legs. This type of mange can cause severe swelling and lameness.</p><p>Sarcoptic mange: The most severe form of mange in horses is caused by the varmite. The first sign is intense itching, followed by crusty lesions, particularly on the head, neck, and shoulders. In this form of mange, hairier regions and the lower extremities are not usually affected. Infested skin becomes lichenified, or thick and folded, and may cover large areas of the body. Untreated, this form of mange is likely to cause health deterioration, weakness, and weight loss.</p><p>Psoroptic mange: Mites of the andspecies infest and cause lesions on the hairiest parts of horses' bodies, including the mane, tail, fetlocks, and chin.</p><p>Demodectic mange: Hair follicles and sebaceous glands are susceptible to overgrowth of normal skin mites of the orspecies. mites infest hair follicles and sebaceous glands. occurs all over a horse's body, but are limited to the eyelids and muzzle. Immunocompromised horses are most vulnerable. The lesions caused by demodectic mange are not very itchy, and they often resolve without treatment, especially if a horse's overall health condition is improved.<br/></p>",944
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/trim-your-horses-tail-safely-5443046,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Grooming,<h1>How to Neatly Trim Your Horse's Tail Safely</h1>,"<h1>How to Neatly Trim Your Horse's Tail Safely</h1><p>A horse's tail is the pride and joy of many a horse owner, but requires careful maintenance. Overly long tails risk being stepped on by the horse or caught up in fences, jumps, or out on the trail. Learn how to trim a horse's tail safely and neatly.</p><h2>What Are the Parts of a Horse Tail? </h2><p>A horse tail is made up of the last few vertebrae of the spine, the coccygeal vertebrae. Horses have between 15-21 of these little bones, and they can be felt at the center of the tail hair running from the tailhead to a little higher than the level of the stifle. The hair of the tail grows long from the skin lightly covering these bones. The muscles that control the tail are at the tailhead and are powerful and accurate. While the purpose of the tail is to swat away flies, horses also use their tails to communicate anxiety by rapidly swishing them back and forth.</p><p>Of course, it would be terrible for the horse to accidentally trim the ""living"" part of the tail that includes skin and bone, but it is rare for any horse person to want a tail that short. The exception is carriage or pulling horses, which sometimes have their tails kept short to not interfere with the carriage, sleigh, or cart. However, these horses can still have just their tail hairs trimmed without getting caught in the harness or carriage.</p><p>""Docking"" tails, or removing vertebrae for cosmetic reasons, is not supported by the American Veterinary Medical Association.<br/></p><h2>How Long Should My Horse's Tail Be? </h2><p>The length of a tail depends on the purpose or discipline of the horse as well as how much care an owner can provide for a tail. For example, dressage horses usually have tails cut straight across at the level of the fetlock or even a bit higher. Arabians and Morgans in the show arena have long tails, often dragging on the ground. Hunters and Quarter horses in the show ring have tails that are cut in between the fetlock and ground, but volume in these is emphasized to the point where people will supplement with extensions or ""fake tails.""</p><p>Any owner wishing to emphasize length and volume will need to prevent tail hair breakage. This can only be achieved with careful brushing using a soft-bristled brush designed for textured hair or manually breaking up tangles (""picking"") with ample use of detangler. Horse tails are often wrapped in tail bags, especially if length is to be promoted. Make sure to only wrap the tail below the tail bone to maintain blood circulation in the part of the live tail.</p><h2>Trimming the tail </h2><h3>Tips for Trimming a Horse Tail</h3><p>1.Detangle the tail carefully before cutting, and make sure it is clean and dry. Hair contracts as it dries, so cutting a horse tail wet will give a false sense of length!</p><p>2.Consider your horse's tail carriage. An Arabian or Saddlebred horse carries their tail very high when moving; cutting their tail with the tailhead down will result in a shorter-looking tail when they're in the ring.</p><p>3.Use sharp scissors. Horsehair is coarse and dull scissors will push the hair away rather than cutting it.</p><p>There are two areas where the tail may be trimmed to neaten appearanceat the tailhead and the bottom. The tail head has fine, wispy hairs that are much shorter than the rest of the tail. These may be trimmed with very sharp salon scissors or with electrical clippers to the level of the longer, sleeker hairs below. Alternatively, this area may be braided or hair gel may be applied to reduce the ""flyaway"" appearance of the tailhead for showing. Braids should always be taken out immediately after showing to reduce hair breakage and promote blood supply to the tailhead.<br/></p><p>The most common area to trim is the bottom of the tail. There are some tips to achieve the effect desired and to remain safe.</p><h3>Steps of Trimming a Horse Tail</h3><p>1.With your cutting hand, reach under the tail at the top and elevate the tailbone with your forearm. Gauge the length of tail you want removed, considering your horse's natural tail carriage. Reach down to grasp the bottom of the tail at the level you want to trim it with your other hand. You can then remove your cutting hand from underneath the tail head to trim.</p><p><br/></p><p>2.Trim the tail standing up with the length of tail you want trimmed in your non-dominant hand. This will keep your head away from the horse's hind legs if they get spooked and prevent you from removing too much tail. Remove only a bit at a timeyou can always take more!</p><p><br/></p><p>3.Once the tail is trimmed to the length desired, neaten or bang the tail by trimming any errant long pieces. Let the tail fall, then pick the ends back up with your non-dominant and direct it towards yourself so you can see the end well. Trim any long pieces without taking more length from the bulk of the tail. Repeat this three times to achieve a neat, square appearance.</p><p>While the purpose of a horse's tail is to swat away pests, a lush, long, shiny tail is an emblem of good health and care in many stables and show rings. Grooming, in general, is a great non-food treat for horses and a way to promote the human-animal bond.</p>",895
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hoof-cracks-and-chips-1886835,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Grooming,<h1>Tips for Hoof Cracks and Chips</h1>,"<h1>Tips for Hoof Cracks and Chips</h1><p>Many horses develop hoof cracks at some point in their lives. Most are innocuous and resolve themselves with good nutrition and consistent farrier care. But there are many types of hoof cracks, and sometimes you'll need to take extra steps to make sure the crack 'heals' and no new cracks develop. These are serious, and they need to be treated.</p><p>As with any horse problem, the first thing you need to ask yourself is ""why is this problem happening?"" Because horse's hooves grow at a slow rate, about one centimeter (slightly less than 1/2 inch) per month, hoof cracks can take a long time to grow out once they get started. Finding the answer to the question is less time consuming, expensive, and frustrating than just trying different random solutions.</p><h2>Other Names </h2><p>Hoof cracks are named for the area of the hoof they are located, or the suspected cause: quarter cracks (full thickness crack often originating at coronary band and progressing distally which may lead to lameness and/or infection); heel cracks, toe cracks, sand cracks (result from injury to the coronary band and may cause lameness); bar cracks, and grass cracks (occur in horses with long unshod hooves).</p><h2>Causes </h2><p>There are many reasons why hoof cracks form. Nutritional deficiencies can cause fine cracks on all four hooves. The hoof walls may be thin or weak, slow-growing, show ridged horizontal rings, and the free edge of the hoof may chip easily.</p><p>In very wet or dry conditions hooves can weaken, especially if the horse is exposed to extremes such as wet-then-frozen ground, or wet-then-very-hard, dry surfaces. Some moisture is good for hooves, but continually standing in muddy, wet conditions or soggy bedding and wet manure can make the hoof material expand and weaken.</p><p>Hard surfaces can be a problem for horses ridden barefoot over rocky or paved surfaces. Hooves can chip and wear if horses have to travel over these surfaces frequently. Some hoof protection, either a shoe or boot, can help prevent these types of cracks.</p><h2>Symptoms </h2><p>Hoof cracks can travel horizontally or vertically. Horizontal cracks and lines on all four hooves may be a sign of nutritional deficiencies. Short horizontal cracks may indicate a hoof abscess has erupted through the coronet band at the top of the hoof. As the hoof grows out, the crack grows down the hoof. As it reaches the free edge, it may cause the hoof to chip.</p><p>If only one foot is affected, nutritional deficiencies can be ruled out. If only the front hooves are involved, suspect concussion cracks from hard surfaces. If the horse is traveling over hard surfaces a lot, then back hooves may also crack. Cracks in the front hooves may also be a sign of contracted heels.</p><p>Quarter and sand cracks near the heel of the hooves may be an indication of poorly trimmed hooves. If the heels get ""run under"" or shallow, the hoof wall may crack due to uneven weight distribution. This too may indicate that contracted heels are developing.</p><p>If the hooves are chipping, it may indicate that the horse frequently travels over rough or abrasive surfaces such as rock or gravel, frozen mud, or ice. Although hoof material is very strong, it is still not as hard as stone or pavement. Horses that must travel on these surfaces need some protection.</p><p>Some cracks are caused by an injury at the coronet band either by a direct hit or by repeated concussion over hard surfaces. Cracks and chips can also form if the hoof is left untrimmed. White-line diseasean infection that sets in between the hoof wall and underlying hoof structuresmay cause the hoof to split, crack, or chip.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If wet, dry, or very hard conditions are to blame, you may have to change the horse's environment. If mud or wet is a problem yourhorse may have to spend at least part of the day on a dry surface like wood pellets or dry sand that will help draw moisture out. If dry conditions are the problem, many people let their water troughs run over, forming a damp area that the horse must stand in to drink. Hoof oils may not help as these products may seal out moisture. In extreme cases, where hoof cracks are affecting the horse's soundness, shoes, staples or other supportive materials such as acrylic patches may be necessary to reinforce the hoof as the hoof crack heals. If laminitis or a severe infection is involved, a veterinarian can prescribe treatment options such as antibiotics.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Balanced trims by a good farrier and good nutrition are the cornerstones of good hoof health. If the horse must travel over rough surfaces such as roads, gravel, rocks, or ice consider using either shoes or hoof boots. Some horses will ""toughen up"" if exposed gradually to these surfaces, but some may always stay sensitive and need some extra protection. It's important to realize that, because hooves grow relatively slowly, repairing cracks can be a long slow process.</p>",825
41,https://www.thesprucepets.com/learn-the-parts-of-the-hoof-and-their-functions-1887332,Horses > Horse Health & Wellness > Horse Grooming,<h1>Parts of a Horse's Hooves and Their Functions</h1>,"<h1>Parts of a Horse's Hooves and Their Functions</h1><h2>Understanding Horses' and Ponies' Hooves</h2><p>To many people, a horse's hoof may look like a solid object, tough and hard all the way through. However, that isn't the case. The hoof is made up of several different layers and structures, each with a specific function.</p><h2>Evolution of the Hoof </h2><p>Horses have evolved from the four-toed, dog-likeeohippus into the single-toed creature we know today. Evidence of the vanished toes remains. The chestnut and ergot are cartilage-like protrusions along the inside of the horse's legs, and on the underside of the pastern joint.</p><p>On some horses, they grow rapidly and although no harm is done if they are left to break off naturally, they are sometimes trimmed for a neater appearance. Two bones run down either side of the horse's front leg between the knee and pastern joint. These two splint bones are believed to be what remains of the former toes.</p><h2>Inside the Hoof </h2><p>There are three bones inside the hoof. The longest is the short pastern bone that extends down from the long pastern bone in the horse's leg.</p><p>The largest bone within the hoof is the pedal or coffin bone. Within this bone are many minuscule passageways for blood vessels and nerves.</p><p>Beneath the junction of the short pastern bone and the coffin bone sits the small navicular bone. Several tendons and ligaments run down from the leg and attach to the bones within the foot.</p><p>Surrounding these bones is the sensitive laminae. This is a layer of tissue that carries blood to all the components of the hoof. Beneath the sensitive laminae and bone structures sits the digital cushion. This is a rubbery pad of tissue that forms the heel of the hoof and helps absorb the shock as the horse's hoof makes contact with the ground.</p><h2>Visible Parts of the Hoof </h2><p>Surrounding the sensitive laminae is the horny laminae. This layer is quite hard and has no feeling. It attaches to the outer wall of the hoof in a similar fashion to hook and loop fastener.</p><p>The margin where the wall and the horny laminae attach is called the white line, which provides the farrier with a visual indication of how deep he can trim the hoof, and where to set in the nails for horseshoes.</p><p>The wall is similar in composition and function to our fingernails and is constantly growing. The wall of the hoof can be very thin, or very thick depending on the type of horse, its nutrition and environment. Wild horses wear down hoof growth naturally, but domestic horses require regular trimming by a farrier.</p><p>The color of the hoof is influenced by the color of the skin above it. If a horse has white markings directly above the hoof, the hoof wallmay carry down the same pigmentation. Many people believe that hooves with black walls are stronger than hooves with white walls. This is not true.</p><h2>Hooves' Natural Protection </h2><p>The very outside of the wall is protected by the periople. This layer protects the moisture within the hoof. The coronary band runs around the very top of the hoof. This is a blood-rich band from which the hoof grows, somewhat similar to the cuticle on our fingernail. Severe damage to this band can cause deformities of the hoof wall.</p><p>On the underside of the hoof is the sole. This is a concave, thick but flexible padding of hard tissue that protects the sensitive sole directly beneath the bones of the foot.</p><p>In the middle of the sole sits the V-shaped frog. The frog contacts the ground surface as the horse travels and helps the blood circulate in the foot. The cleft of the frog runs down the middle of the frog and aids in flexion and grip. The bars of the foot run on either side of the frog, and they provide stable suspension for the walls and frog as the horse's foot impacts the ground.</p><h2>Basic Care for Horses' Hooves </h2><p>Domestic horses require daily foot care to stay healthy. It is important to clean dirt and manure from the underside of the hooves as well as remove any lodged rocks, sticks or even pine cones that can cause discomfort and bruising.</p><p>As you visually check your whole horse, look for any swelling or cuts around the foot. If your farrier recommends it, coat your horse's hooves with a moisturizing dressing when grooming. If your horse has weak hoof walls consider trying one of the many feed supplements that claim to benefit hoof growth.</p><p>About every six weeks, a farrier should trim down growth, help correct any hoof problems and suggest proper care depending on your horse's use and environment.</p>",790
42,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-horses-eat-apples-1886470,Horses > Horse Nutrition & Food,<h1>Things a Horse Shouldn't Eat</h1>,"<h1>Things a Horse Shouldn't Eat</h1><p>It's nice to treat your horse to special foods sometimes. However, there are a few things they probably shouldn't eat. What shouldn't you feed your horse? Here is a list of the foods that probably shouldn't be included in your horse's diet.</p><h2>Fruit in Large Quantities </h2><p>Many of us like to feed our horses apples as treats. But excessive amounts of fruit can become too much of a good thing. A belly full of apples or any other fruit can cause colic or other complications. You probably should not feed your horse more than one or two pieces of fruit. The danger is when horses have access to windfall fruit from a wild tree, or someone dumps a basket of spoiled apples over the fence thinking they're giving the horse a ""treat.""</p><h2>Lawn and Garden Clippings </h2><p>Lawn and garden clippings can contain several hazards. Just-cut or semi-wilted plant material can be a problem in itself, even if it appears to contain nothing but grass.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Clippings can contain toxic plants and there are several common garden plants, like horse nettle, that fall into this category. Some weeds can also be toxic. Whatever gets sprayed onto lawns and gardens to control pests and weeds may be toxic too.</p><p>Because horses don't have to graze and chew the material for themselves, they may bolt the food and fill up on it much faster. This can lead to choke and colic. The sugars in freshly cut or slightly wilted clippings can cause an imbalance in the horse's gut, leading to laminitis. Put lawn and garden waste into your composter or manure pile, not over the fence into your horse's pasture.</p><h2>Meat </h2><p>""Deadly Equines, The Shocking True Story of Meat-Eating & Murderous Horses"" by CuChullaine O'Reilly, the Founder of the Long Riders' Guild, explores the fact that horses can and do eat meat (and some can appear to behave in quite a violent manner to get it). However, just because they can and do eat meat, does not mean that they should.</p><p>A horse may be trained to eat meat, or it may be driven to it by need. This doesn't mean that a regular diet of meat in the long-term is a good thing. Your horse may like an occasional bite of your hamburger or tuna sandwich, and can eat it without harm. However, since we don't know the long-term effects on most horses, a diet high in meat would be inadvisable (and expensive).</p><p>Horses have the teeth and digestive system of a highly specialized herbivore. Our horses will likely be healthiest eating the diet their digestive system has evolved to digest.</p><h2>Cruciferous Vegetables </h2><p>You may already know someone who gets uncomfortable after they eat cabbage, broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts or other vegetables in the cabbage family. Your horse may feel the same type of discomfort after eating ""gassy"" vegetables like these. A few leaves or sprouts may not matter, but dumping the old plants over the fence probably isn't a great idea.</p><h2>Moldy or Dusty Hay </h2><p>If good pasture is not available, good-quality hay is the next-best choice. However, never feed your horse dusty or moldy hay. To do so could lead to respiratory disease.It'snot okay to feed hay that's only a bit dusty or has a bit of mold on it.</p><h2>Bran Mashes </h2><p>Many people may be surprised to learn that bran mashes are not recommended except as an occasional treat. Over-consumption of bran mashes can lead to mineral imbalances, so you might not want to offer them more than once a week, or preferably, even less frequently.</p><h2>Alsike Clover </h2><p>Eating alsike clover may cause a very nasty sunburn, sores in the mouth, and problems like colic, diarrhea, and big liver syndrome. Alsike clover is common in pastures. It can grow up to 30 inches/76 centimeters high and in addition to its clover-shaped leaves has a round flower head of pretty pink.</p><p>You can tell it apart from red clover because it doesn't have the distinctive white ""V"" on the leaves that other clovers do. If your horse snaps up a few stalks of alsike clover occasionally, it's probably okay, but prolonged consumption or a large amount at once may cause problems.</p><h2>Cattle Feed </h2><p>Cattle feed contains supplements that are good for cattle but are very toxic to horses. Drugs like rumensin are routinely added to cattle feed. These drugs can be deadly for horses. This is why it's a good idea to buy feed from mills that specialize exclusively in making horse feeds.</p><h2>Silage and Haylage </h2><p>Feeding haylage (sometimes called baleage) and silage to horses is more common in the UK and Europe than it is in North America. Feeding silage and haylage to horses can be tricky. There are some definite benefits to offering these forages to your horses, like a higher nutritional value and low levels of dust.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>The manner in which the hay is cut and baled can increase the risk of botulism poisoning. Horses are very sensitive to the botulinum toxin and exposure to, or ingestion of the toxin can lead to paralysis and death. Because the hay is baled at a high moisture content and is wrapped in plastic, it is the ideal environment for toxin to grow. Soil carrying the botulinum toxin can be baled into the hay, where the bacteria may continue to grow.</p><p>The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs highlights both some advantages and disadvantages of feeding haylage and silage to horses. Eight types of botulinum toxins have been identified, but only three are known to affect horses. A vaccine is available for the most common type to affect horses - type B. Care must be taken to ensure uneaten silage or haylage is cleaned up. There is a possibility that frozen silage can lead to colic, and we don't yet understand if there are long-term effects of feeding acidic (and treated or conditioned hay) fodder to horses.</p><p>Feeding Treats To Horses.</p>",1028
43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-horses-eat-that-keep-them-healthy-1886504,Horses > Horse Nutrition & Food,<h1>What to Feed a Horse to Keep It Healthy</h1>,"<h1>What to Feed a Horse to Keep It Healthy</h1><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Horses have very specific dietary needs because they are herbivores, and have a unique digestive tract quite different from ours. Their long digestive system requires a high-fiber diet that is consumed in small amounts over a long time period. Rather than a few large meals, like we typically eat, horses usually eat many small meals throughout the day.Horses actually spend most of their time eating! Here is a quick rundown of what horses eat and a few things they shouldn't.</p><h2>Pasture Grass and Tender Plants </h2><p>The natural diet of the horse is pasture grass and tender plants. Good pasture contains most of the nutrition a horse requires to be healthy. It also contains silica, which is important for dental health. Primitive horses can live on sparse rations and often have to make do with less than ideal pasture and living conditions. This is likely why problems like obesity, equine metabolic syndrome, and laminitis are rare in wild horses but occur frequently in our modern horses. Pasture grass isn't necessarily the problem; the type of horses we've developed and the lack of exercise are.</p><p>Those of us with easy keepers need to limit the amount of fresh grass our horses have access to. Introducing lush pasturesuddenly to a horse not used to it can cause serious problems as well. For the horse that is a hard keeper, however, good pasture provides the best nutrition.</p><h2>Hay </h2><p>Many of us don't have the luxury of being able to let our horses graze on pasture throughout the whole year. When grass isn't available, hay is the next-best choice. Finding good horse hay can be tricky. It helps to have hay tested,so any shortfalls in vitamins and minerals can be compensated for with supplements. For some horses, rich hay can be a problem in the same way rich pasture grass can be. Easy keepersmay need to be restricted from 24/7 access to a bale feeder.</p><h2>Grains </h2><p>Oats are a traditional grain fed to horses. However, horses may also be fed small amounts of other grains like corn. Some grains, such as wheat, aren't always good for horses. The seed head of grasses would be the closest thing a wild horse would come to eating grains in their natural environment.</p><p>Grains that are grown, harvested, and processed using modern-day methods are not natural foods for horses. It is easy to feed too much grain to horses. Grain also doesn't require a similar length of chewing time, nor does it contain the levels of silica that grass does. This can contribute to issues including ulcers and dental problems. A horse that over-eats a large amount of grain may have colic or founder.</p><h2>Concentrate Mixes </h2><p>Concentrates are usually a mixture of things like grains, flaxseed, beet pulp, molasses for energy and flavor, bran, vitamins and minerals, and other ingredients. Commercial mixes may have a number of ingredients in them, or some feed mills will mix concentrates to your specifications (only practical when you have a large number of horses to feed).</p><p>Concentrate mixes, like grain,help make up for any shortfall in nutritionand provide a quick source of energy. Mares in foal, nursing mares, performance, or working horses often benefit from being fed concentrates in addition to grass or hay.</p><h2>Salt and Minerals </h2><p>Supplements such as salt and minerals may be included in a concentrate mixor may be offered separately. A salt block or loose salt in a pasture or stall allows horses to help themselves when they have a craving. Some salt may come mixed with minerals. Some people offer free-choice minerals as well, or they may add them into the horse's grain or concentrate meal. Many people find that salt is consumed more during the summer months than in colder weather.</p><h2>Treats </h2><p>Many of us like to feed our horses treats. These tidbits may include things like apples, carrots, or other favorite fruits or vegetables, handfuls of grain, sugar cubes or candies, or sometimes odd things like a bite of a hot dog or boiled egg. However, it may not be advisable to feed horses meat or too many sugary treats, including fruit. Horses are herbivores, and even though a horse may not show outward signs like colic when fed meat, they may still feel some discomfort and strange foods could affect the intestinal flora.</p><p>Of course, a horse won't make the connection to the hamburger they ate an hour ago and the discomfort they're having now, so they'll probably eat any food they like over and over again. This is why it's important to feed treats in small amounts. Treats need to be considered as part of the overall feeding plan and kept to a minimum if your horse needs to watch its weight. Your horse also needs to be respectful when being fed treats.</p><h2>Water </h2><p>Of course, a horse doesn't really ""eat"" water. However, water is an essential part of the equine diet. A horse eating pasture grass probably won't drink as much water as one on a hay-only diet. However, fresh, clean water is essential for both.</p><h2>A Note About Bran </h2><p>Brans, including wheat and rice bran, are not recommended as a major part of your horse's diet; they can cause mineral imbalances.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Don't be tempted to throw lawn clippings, garden refuse or compostables over the fence.

It's fun to see your horse enjoy its meals and come running to you when it sees you with the feed bucket. But it's easy to make a mistake when planning your horse's dietary needs. Avoid these 10 common feeding mistakes.</p><h2>Overfeeding </h2><p>As horse owners, we usually enjoy looking after our companions and that often means providing them with the best feeds possible. However, it's easy to go overboard on the feed. Overfeeding can lead to problems of obesity including equine metabolic syndrome and can lead to laminitis.If you find yourself becoming a master chef for a horse that doesn't have any unusual or specific feeding requirements, you could be in danger of overfeeding your horse. Most horses need a very simple diet of good pasture or hay, and they only need supplements or concentrates if there is a shortfall in nutrition. There's no need to be mixing and cooking bran mashes, slicing carrots, and serving up elaborate meals. Having hay tested is a good idea, as it can indicate what types of supplements you might need to add to your horse's diet.</p><p>Overfeeding is a particular problem in young horses. While it's tempting to keep your weanling or yearling pleasingly plump, too rapid growth can cause joint malformations. Your youngster will benefit from slow steady growth, regular parasite control medications, and ample exercise that would keep it lean and fit.</p><h2>Underfeeding </h2><p>Underfeeding can be a problem with senior horses and horses that are working hard. While hard-working horses can be expected to look lean, they shouldn't look gaunt. If hay or pasture won't keep your working horse in good condition, look to concentrates to make up the shortfall. However, keep in mind that the bulk of your horse's diet should be made up of grass or hay. Underfeeding hay or pasture, and overfeeding grains and concentrates can lead to colic.</p><p>Senior horses lose the ability to digest food efficiently and may need a little extra help in the form of supplements and concentrates. Look for feeds specially developed for senior horses.</p><h2>Inadequate Pasture Grass </h2><p>It's easy to look at a pasture from the distance and think it's lush and green. But closer inspection may reveal that your pasture is being overtaken by undesirable weeds. This means horses have to work harder to find enough food and may start eating the less nutritional, and sometimes toxic, weeds. Look after your pasture so they can provide good grazing for your horses.</p><h2>Poor Hay </h2><p>Buying hay can be difficult, but it really is worth it to be particular, because poor hay can cause all types of problems. Hay may be nutritionally deficient. Some hays are not suitable for horses and can cause colic. Dusty, moldy hay can be bad for your horse's lungs and overall health.</p><h2>Calculating by Volume Not Weight </h2><p>It's important to feed both hay and concentrates by weight not by volume. Although it will be difficult to determine the weight of the hay your horse eats if it is eating free choice from a round bale, you can estimate the weight of the hay your horse is eating if you're using small square bales. Why is this important? Generally, owners throw their horses a 'few flakes' of hay for each meal. But not all small squares are of equal weight.</p><p>Weighing grain concentrates is important too. Most caretakers use the scoop method. But horse feed companies recommend feeding by weight and calculate recommended portions by body weight. If you just go by eye, you may be under- or over-feeding your horse. Weigh the portions at least once, to calculate the recommended amount for your horse, and then make a mark on your scoop, so you know you're feeding the same amount each time.</p><h2>Over-Supplementing </h2><p>At best, over-supplementing is throwing your money away. At worst, over-supplementing can cause mineral or vitamin imbalances.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Some vitamins and minerals can be toxic when consumed in large quantities.</p><p>Before adding vitamin or mineral supplements, have your hay analyzed and check the ingredients of your concentrates.</p><h2>Ignoring Parasite Control </h2><p>Some internal parasites compete with your horse for the food they eat. A regular deworming program can get rid of harmful parasites that can both steal nutrients and damage your horse's internal organs.</p><h2>Ignoring Dental Issues </h2><p>While equine dental problems aren't really a feeding problem, your horse will not be able to get all of the nutrition it needs, if it can't chew properly. This is especially common in older horses that may have missing or loose teeth. Mature horses can develop hooks and sharp edges on their teeth, which can make chewing painful. Regular dental care is a must.</p><h2>Not Providing Adequate Water </h2><p>Providing clean plentiful water is essential to your horse's health. Impaction colic can occur if your horse, especially one who has access to only hay, doesn't stay well hydrated. Very cold water can dissuade horses from drinking in the winterand not surprisingly, that's when impaction colic is most common. A trough heater or half bucket of hot water mixed with the cold is a good way to make sure your horse doesn't have to drink icy cold water.</p><h2>Not Providing Salt </h2><p>Salt is important to maintain your horse's electrolyte balance. Some people put loose salt on their horse's feed. Be careful not to 'over-salt'. Most horses can self-regulate with a salt block in their stall or pasture.</p>",891
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hay-substitutes-1886506,Horses > Horse Nutrition & Food,<h1>Hay Substitutes for Horses</h1>,"<h1>Hay Substitutes for Horses</h1><p>When hay becomes scarce it often leaves horse owners scrambling to keep their horses healthy and well fed. Any number of natural disasters can affect the growth of hay fields. In most areas of North America, farmers are able to harvest two hay crops per season. Some areas may even be able to get a third 'cut'. Drought, late springs, floods, and other disasters can mean the growth will be sparser and the cuts will be fewer. Less hay means not only is it harder to find, but it will cost more per bale. Horse owners may have to ship hay in from other areas, and that too can add to the cost andtake more time to source and transport.</p><p>Horses are grazers who spend most of their time chewing, so they may nibble on wood fences, stall partitions, or trees to satisfy the need. It's recommended that at  minimum a horse should eat 1% of its body weight in fodder. Ideally, a horse should eat 2-2.5% of its weight in good quality fodderhay or grass.</p><p>Horses need the bulk fiber of hay to stay healthy. Although they can eat grain, they still need a forage substitute that provides the +20% fiber content that good pasture or hay provides. There are a few things that you can feed horses as a substitute for hay. Whatever you decide to feed, it's important to start feeding any of these fodder substitutes gradually and carefully monitor your horse's condition.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If a horse does not get enough bulk fodder, it may cause problems like ulcers (EGUS) and colic.</p><h2>Beet Pulp </h2><p>Beet pulp is a by-product of the sugar beet and is often fed to horses. Many horse owners notice that when theyfeed beet pulp, horses eat less hay. Feeding beet pulp is easy and it can be fed dry or wet. In hot weather, wet beet pulp can sour and in cold weather, freeze to the feed tub. Beet pulps contain fiber, calcium, protein but no vitamins. Beet pulp can be fed in combination with hay or other fodders and a complete concentrate.</p><h2>Straw </h2><p>If you read books about horse care in bygone times, you might be aware that straw was commonly fed to horses. You may have a horse that is quite happy to munch on its straw bedding. Most of us view straw as bedding only. Straw is the stalks of harvested grains. Since the plant has come to the end of its life cycle, it has no nutrition.</p><p>Used in combination with a concentrate that provides ample nutrition that includes mineral, vitamins,and proteins, oat straw can give horses something to graze on. Rye straw may carry a fungus that can affect mares in foal. Wheat and barley straw are less appealing to horses. Youngsters or seniors may not be able to digest straw easily.</p><h2>Hay Cubes </h2><p>Hay cubes may be an alternative to bales. Grass and legume hay are dried and chopped and pressed into cubes. The downside of hay cubes is that there is an increased chance of choke if they are fed dry and they don't fulfill the horse's need to chew. Since hay cubes tend to be expensive, they could be used in combination with poorer quality hay.</p><h2>Silage, Ensilage or Haylage </h2><p>Feeding Silage, ensilage or haylage is popular in some areas, but it does come with risks. The benefit to farmers is that it can be bagged at about 45% moisture, so it can be harvested in damp conditions. Since it isn't dry, it's beneficial to feed horses because there is no dustgood for horses with COPD and other respiratory problems.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>The downside of silage or haylage is that there is a chance of botulism poisoning. Handling can be tricky because the bag must not be punctured during storage. If you plan to feed haylage, ensilage or silage you should have your horse vaccinated for botulism before you start feeding this fodder.</p><h2>Concentrates </h2><p>Concentrates, available in many forms, can ensure that your horse is getting the nutrition it needs and makes up for any shortfalls in the fodder you may need to feed. There are a lot of different forms and vitamin/mineral/protein/fiber combinations, so you'll need to examine the labelsand match the concentrate to your horse's needs. Feeding concentrates by themselves is not recommended. Your horse will still need a source of fiber.</p><h2>Alfalfa </h2><p>Often, legumes like alfalfa will grow in conditions that grass won't grow in. Since alfalfa is high in calcium, it's important to make sure the horse is getting concentrates or supplements that balance its diet. Alfalfa should be fed in combination with grass hay.</p><h2>Old Hay </h2><p>Yes, you can use hay from previous years as long as it has been kept clean and dry. The nutritional content will decline over time, but that can easily be made up with concentrates. Testing is the best way to figure out how to make up for any shortfalls.</p><h2>Don't Feed </h2><p>Brans, including wheat and rice bran, are not recommended as a major part of your horse's diet. All can cause mineral imbalances.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Don't be tempted to throw lawn clippings, garden refuse or compostables over the fence. All can contain plants toxic to horses.</p>",857
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-your-pony-1886472,Horses > Horse Nutrition & Food,<h1>Guide to Feeding Your Pony</h1>,"<h1>Guide to Feeding Your Pony</h1><p>Ask a pony owner and they'll tell you, ponies are tougher, smarter, stronger, and healthier than any horse. They tend to be hardier, have few hoofproblems, and are less prone to some types of colic. They run on a lot less fuel too. Rations that would starve a horse will keep a pony round and energetic. Learn what to feed your pony to keep them healthy.</p><h2>Nutritional Needs </h2><p>Most pony breeds developed where the pasture was verysparse, the terrain rugged, and the climate harsh. They had to work hard to find their food and so, in a short time, they have evolved to use what little food they could find very efficiently.When we pamper them, feed special preparations and lush grass, wevery oftendo more harm than good. Overfeeding is more often a problem for poniesthan underfeeding.</p><p>Ponies need only a fraction of the feed that horses do. Hay for ponies should be good quality grass hay. Your pony probably won't need the nutrition provided by alfalfa and clovers. These fodders, which are more energy- and nutrient-dense than many grasshays, are often too rich for a pony.</p><h2>Pasturing </h2><p>Lush pasture is a danger zone for ponies. Ponies can quickly succumb to founder, if introduced suddenly to lush grass. If you plan to keep your pony on grass, introduce it very slowly and allow it to fill up on hay before turning it out to graze. If your pony eats too much rich pasture, or undergoes abrupt or rapid changes in the diet, this could lead to colic or founder. You may never be able to leave some ponies on good pasture. Ponies can become obese very quickly and that can lead to health problems like metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Grass that grows slowly would be ideal. Or he could spend a small portion of his time on pasture and the rest in a grassless paddock. It might be necessary to keep a pony off of pasture for a portion of the day. It sometimes takes a bitof creativity to find ways to restrict the amount of feed your pony is receiving.Some people use their round pen or a paddock, where no grass grows. Another option is to use a grazing muzzle. Grazingmuzzles let a pony graze, but only have access to a few blades at a time. The spaces in the muzzle also allow the pony to drink, so of course, make sure your pony has access to clean fresh water.</p><h2>Extra Feeds </h2><p>Ponies rarely need concentrates or grain. The exception would be a pony that is working very hard; one that is doing several lessons a week, being driven frequently, doing something like pulling competitions, or a lactating marewith a foalby her side. If your pony is losing condition, you could increase the quantity of hay, and if that isn't enough, add a concentrate that isn't too rich. A forage replacer fortified with vitamins and minerals might give your pony the nutritional energy boost it needs without adding extra pounds.</p><p>If you like to feed your pony even if it is not working hardand for some owners, this is a very satisfying activitylook for a concentrate that is low in calories. Some manufacturers make special pony mixes. These mixes are balanced with the correct amount of supplements for a pony. Don't be tempted to top dress it with a lot of extras like molasses or beet pulp. If you are feeding good hay, the pony is getting a bit of pasture, and you have a mineral/salt block available, your pony will be getting what he needs. If you feed treats, it's best to consider these in the context of the overall diet, so you won't be overdoing it.</p><h2>Health Maintenance </h2><p>Pony mouths are small, so overgrown teeth can be a problem. Hooks and sharp edges can make chewing uncomfortable, because their mouths are comparatively more compact, and teeth, tongue, and gums can be closer together than in some horses.Don't forget to have your vet check your pony's teeth to ensure it can chew easily. You don't want your pony losing weight because it has a sore mouth. A sore mouth can also lead to behavioral problems while carrying a bit. Ponies also need regular deworming to keep them in the best health.</p>",746
47,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horse-care-tips-and-tricks-5425423,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>10 Horse Care Tips and Tricks</h1>,"<h1>10 Horse Care Tips and Tricks</h1><p>Owning a horse is a life-long dream for many. Horses are wonderful companions and form strong bonds with their caretakers. They're a source of exercise, whether you want to ride your horse or just work with them on the ground. They also can be a foundation for family bonding and teach younger family members responsibility. Here are 10 tips to know if you are considering horse ownership.</p><h2>Type of Horse </h2><p>There are many different types of horses used for a multitude of activities or disciplines. Familiarize yourself with different horse breeds. A healthy horse can carry 20% of its weight (rider and tack), so it is important to consider size if you want a riding horse. Past training and current ability figure extensively into a horse's price. It's important to rank a horse's safety and experience highly for any prospective owner, especially a first-time buyer.</p><h2>Where to Keep Your Horse </h2><p>A horse owner may either keep their horse at their home or pay to board it elsewhere. At minimum, a horse needs an area cleared of debris for exercise, a covered shelter, access to clean, fresh water, and good-quality grass or hay.</p><p>Even if a home has enough land to keep a horse, it requires a lot of work to keep the area clean and your horse fed and watered.The price to board a horse depends on the area that your horse is kept in as well as where you live geographically. The amount of care the facility provides will also influence cost. Full-service barns provide daily feeding and stall cleaning but cost more than barns where owners are responsible for these tasks.</p><h2>Environment </h2><p>Horses need to live in a clean area. If they are in a stall, the stall should be cleaned at least once daily (preferably twice) of any manure or wet spots from urine. Horses can doze standing up, but they lay down for deep sleep. Bedding materials such as straw or shavings soak up urine and provide a good sleeping area. Corn cobs and black walnut shavings are dangerous bedding materials and should be avoided.<br/></p><p>If horses don't have a lot of turnout (access to a drylot or pasture to play) then enrichment materials can help stave off boredom. Horses are happy in turnout especially with socialization, but it is important to integrate new members of the herd slowly and judiciously, as injuries may occur as the pecking order is determined.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>The main part of a horse's diet is called roughage and is in the form of pasture or hay. Horses require an average of 1-2% of their bodyweight of hay daily to maintain their body weight. Small, frequent meals may protect them from gastrointestinal upset or colic.</p><p>Most pastures do not supply enough year-round to feed a horse, so high-quality hay is usually necessary. If available, pasture should be evaluated to ensure it is free of toxic plants. Also, some horses get overweight and are prone to diseases such as founder on rich pasture, so consult with your veterinarian on diet.</p><p>All horses should also have access to a mineral salt lick and fresh, clean water. A horse drinks 5 to 10 gallons of water daily and may need more if it is hot or the horse is in exercise. Grains are used to supplement calories if hay alone is not sufficient. It is important to feed grain made especially for horses, as livestock feed contains additives that are toxic and may be deadly for a horse.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Brushing your horse and caring for its feet is an important part of daily healthcare, termed husbandry. It is also a good source of bonding between horse and caretaker. Specialized tools will help maintain a quality haircoat and clearing the nooks and crannies of the soles of the hooves (""picking out the feet"") is essential to keep the horse sound.</p><h2>Foot care </h2><p>The hooves of a horse are analogous to our fingernails and need to be trimmed every six to eight weeks. Horseshoes may need to be placed by your farrier depending on your horse's conformation and intended work.</p><h2>Dental Care </h2><p>Horses eat by grinding down grass, hay, or grain. As a result, they have evolved teeth that continually grow and modify in shape throughout life. Uneven wear leads to painful hooks and points, especially on molars. This can impact ability to eat and can even shorten your horse's lifespan. Every horse should have their teeth checked annually and the points rasped down (floated) by a veterinarian if needed.</p><h2>Preventative and Emergency Care </h2><p>It is very important to have a veterinarian available for healthcare. Vaccination and parasite control (deworming) will extend your horse's life and reduce the risk of disease. Your veterinarian can also help you if your horse becomes lame or suffers an injury or illness that needs emergency attention, like a laceration or colic. It is also important to have a plan to transport your horse in case of emergency, such as a wildfire or if your horse needs to be hospitalized.</p><h2>Tack </h2><p>Tack is the term for any piece of equipment that contributes to the performance of a horse's discipline. This includes the bridle and saddle if a horse is to be ridden, or the harness if you have a carriage horse. Saddles are different between disciplines andfit is very important to keep you and your horse comfortable. All tack should be cleaned after riding and regularly conditioned and checked for damage.</p><h2>Training </h2><p>You probably will want to ride your horse if you have any energy after all of that care. Riding lessons or training for your horse may be helpful. Boarding facilities often have trainers on-site, or you can hire a trainer to come to your horse. Horse riding is a sport; receiving feedback on your riding and your horse's performance can be important regardless of your level.</p><p>All in all, the choice to acquire a horse should not be made lightly. However, horse ownership can be one of the most rewarding decisions you can make for yourself and your family.</p>",999
48,https://www.thesprucepets.com/facts-about-horses-1887392,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>15 Fascinating Facts About Horses</h1>,"<h1>15 Fascinating Facts About Horses</h1><p>Horses are such fascinating creatures. Even if you never learned to ride one, you could spend your whole life studying them and still have plenty to explore. Here are 15 interesting facts about horses.</p><h2>Horses Sleep Standing Up</h2><p>Yes, horses can sleepstanding up! They sleep laying down too. Learn all about the sleeping habits of horses. Horses must lie down to achieve a full restorative sleep cycle for a minimum of 30 minutes per day to avoid sleep deprivation. There are many factors that influence a horse's ability to lay down to sleep and rest. These factors may be environmental such as weather, available space and comfortable bedding or physical deterrents such as musculoskeletal impediments; ie osteoarthritis.</p><h2>Horses Can't Burp </h2><p>That's right! Horses can't burp, at least not the way humans do. They can't vomit or breathe through their mouths like humans do either. A horse's digestive system is a one-way street, unlike cattle and other ruminants who regurgitate food to re-chew it. Although they have a pretty efficient way of processing the tough fibrous foods that make up their forage, this long, one-directional system can cause problems that result in colic.</p><h2>You Can Estimate a Horse's Age by Its Teeth</h2><p>While you can't tell the exact age of a horse by its teeth, you can estimate its age. Horses need proper equine dental care for their teeth, but sometimes a horse lives longer than its teeth do, so extra care is needed when feeding senior horses.</p><h2>Horses Can Live to Be More Than 30 Years Old</h2><p>One of the most common questions about horses is ""how long does a horse live?"" The answer may surprise you. Knowledge of horse nutrition, horse care, and veterinary medicine has increased. Because of this, just as human life expectancy has increased, so has equine longevity.</p><h2>The American Quarter Horse Is the World's Most Popular Breed</h2><p>Appreciated by beginner riders and professional horsemen alike, the American quarter horse is the world's most popular breed. Learn more about the American quarter horse.</p><h2>(Most) Arabian Horses Have One Less Vertebrae Than Other Breeds</h2><p>The Arabian horse is the foundation of many other light horse breeds. They also possess some unique characteristics. Most Arabian horses have one fewer vertebrae, rib bone, and tail bone than other horses.</p><h2>Horses Are Herbivores</h2><p>Humans are omnivores, lions are carnivores, and horses are herbivores. The way their teeth are formed (grinding molars to break down fibrous plant material), the position of their eyes (face to the side to be on the lookout for predators), and the type of digestive system are all typical characteristics of herbivores.</p><h2>Horses Are Herd Animals</h2><p>Horses in the wild live in small herds, and domestic horses feel more comfortable if they have companions too. It can be quite stressful for a horse to live alone. Companionship for horses may be an equine stablemate or even another species such as a goat, donkey, or mule. Even a dog may become a suitable companion for a horse.</p><h2>Horses Were Domesticated by Humans More Than 3,000 Years Ago </h2><p>Dogs may have become domesticated around 14,000 years ago. Cats became human companions about 8,500 years ago. Humankind's relationship with the horse began a little more recently, around 6,000 years ago, although some evidence has come to light that horses may have been domesticated even earlier.</p><h2>Horses Are Measured in ""Hands""</h2><p>The standard measurement for determining the height of a horse is called a hand. One hand is equal to 4 inches. A pony is an equine under 14.2 hands. The only equines not measured in hands are miniature horses, which are measured in inches or centimeters.</p><h2>Most White Horses Are Actually Gray</h2><p>Most of the white horses that you see were actually a much darker color at birth and gradually turn white. These ""white"" horses may start as bay, chestnut, or almost black. These horses aren't called white, but gray.</p><h2>A Horse's Resting Respiratory Rate Is About 8-14 Breaths per Minute </h2><p>It's important to know the resting pulse and respiration rate of your horse. While the resting respiration rate of a horse can be as low as eight breaths per minute, that can quickly increase with work or distress. Learn your horse's resting pulse and respiration rate (TPR).</p><h2>Horses Are Not Native to North America </h2><p>Every horse on the North American continent is a decedent of European horses. Even the horses that we regard as ""wild"" are actually feral horses, whose ancestors escaped from captivity. Horses disappeared from the Americas more than 11,000 years ago, and there is ample fossil evidence that the horse's ancestors lived here previous to that.</p><h2>A Baby Horse is Called a Foal</h2><p>What is the difference between a filly, a colt, and a foal? It all depends on gender and age. Generally, a foal is a baby horse. After it is weaned from its dam, it is called a weanling. But, horses remain fillies or colts until they are four years of age.</p><h2>The Original ""Horse"" Was the Size of a Golden Retriever </h2><p>The original horse was no larger than a golden retriever. Diminutive  may have looked more like a small goat or deer than a modern-day horse.  lived during the Eocene Epoch about 50 million years ago.</p>",873
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-board-a-horse-1886010,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>Determining What It May Cost to Board Your Horse</h1>,"<h1>Determining What It May Cost to Board Your Horse</h1><p>Boarding a horsemay seem like an expensive way to keep a horse, but compared to the purchase and upkeep of a property suitable for horses, it may be a little less expensive. For some people, the only way they can keep a horse is to board it at a stable. The cost of boarding your horse can vary greatly. There are many factors that can affect the price of board at a stable, and many stables have more than one level of board available.</p><h2>Location </h2><p>Expect to pay more if the stable is close toor in an urban area. Board may be less expensive in a rural area where fodder is easier to get and space is less limited. Taxes and land costs are higher in urban areas so expect that to be reflected in the cost of the board. There may also be more competition for boarding closer to urban areas, and this supply and demand can send prices upward. Balance the cost of driving and time driving to a stable further away against the higher priced stable closer to you. Stables in areas that are central to horse shows and other equine events will probably be more expensive than those further away.</p><h2>Facilities and Amenities Available </h2><p>Expect to pay more if the stable offers more. Indoor arenas, groomed riding rings, wash racks, trails, jumps, larger stalls, new barns, automatic waters or feeders will all be reflected in the boarding fees. Well-equipped boarding facilities are costly to build and maintain, and this will be reflected in the cost of the board.</p><h2>Services Provided </h2><p>There are many different levels of care available from complete self-care to full board. The more services that are provided, the more expensive board can be. You may have to pay for extra services on top of your regular board bill as well.Your contract should outline exactly what is and is not included in your board price. Examples of extra services are blanketing, handling the horse for veterinarian and farriervisits, extra feeds and supplements, lessons and coaching, in-stable shows and grooming.</p><h2>Self-Care Board </h2><p>With self-care board, expect to supply everything your horse needs but the shelter and fencing. Water should be available, but you might have to provide a trough or buckets. You'll have to purchase and bring in your own feed, including hay and bedding for stalls. Horses may or may not be checked every day, depending upon the agreement you sign. Expect to travel at least once a day to care for your horse and clean stalls. You will have to arrange to be therefor veterinarian and farrier calls. Self-care board situations provide only the facility, but not the actual care of your horse, so that means work for you. Consider your schedule and how you'll manage things like icy roads and bad weather when deciding to take your horse to a self-care boarding stable.</p><h2>Full Board </h2><p>With full board, everything will be supplied. Stalls will be cleaned, the horse will be fed and watered and basic feeds supplied. Supplements may or may not be supplied and included in the cost,but will be fed if you supply them. Horses will be turned out for exercise daily and blanketed (usually an extra cost) according to the weather. Veterinarians and farriers will be arranged by the owner/manager. You will probably have to attend visits from the farrieror vet, or you may end up paying someone else to attend if you can't. Lessons may be included in the cost, or they will be extra. You'll probably want to visit your horse frequently, but you will come across horse owners at these barns that may not see their horses for weeks or even months.</p><h2>Questions to Ask </h2><p>Between self-care board and full board, there is a wide range of services and amenities that stables provide. Before you move in, read the boarding contract and make sure you understand what is and is not included in the cost, what you'll be expected to do, and what extra expenses you might be charged. Some stables charge a few dollars extra per day to blanket horses or feed supplements. Some will look after your horse when the farrier comes but may charge you for the time. So make sure you avoid surprise additions to your board bill by understanding what is provided.</p><h2>Horse Boarding Prices </h2><p>You might find board for as little as a dollar per dayor partial payment in sweat labor. At a very well-appointed stable with lessons included and close to a major city or event grounds, you can expect to pay over $700 a month for board. Shop around. Talk to other horse owners in your area to find a stable you can afford and that you trust to care for your horse.</p>",796
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/introducing-your-horse-to-pasture-1886474,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>Introducing Your Horse to Pasture</h1>,"<h1>Introducing Your Horse to Pasture</h1><p>Considering that grasses are the most natural food sources for a horse, it surprises many people to learn that there is a proper technique for turning a horse out to graze in lush pasture and that problems can occur if you don't do it correctly. If your animal has been eating hay or browsing on sparse pasture all winter, suddenly turning it out onto a very lush pasture can cause colic and laminitis (also called ""founder,"" a painful inflammation of the hooves). Prolonged exposure to too much high carbohydrate grasses can cause metabolic syndromea cluster of clinical problems that often include obesity, along with the potentially life-threatening illnesses of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The key is a gradual transition. If your horse or pony is grazing in the same pasture from the time the ground thaws in early spring, it will be introduced to the new growth of grass in a slow, natural transition. Many people keep herds of ponies this way without a problem.</p><h2>Ponies </h2><p>Many pony breeds evolved in areas of very sparse pastures, such as mountainous and arid regions, where grass didn't grow thickly.In such environments, ponies spent much of their grazing time searching and navigating rugged terrain, and the constant travel provided considerable exercise to balance the eating. But the thickly grassed pastures common in today's environment make grazing too easy for most ponies, causing them to fill up quickly and remain relatively sedentary, as compared to their wild ancestors. For this reason, you must be very careful to introduce ponies very slowly to grass and watch them to make sure they aren't eating too much, too quickly. Allow ponies just a few minutes of grazing when you first introduce to pasture, gradually building up the time spent there. The full transition can take several weeks until you are satisfied that the ponies can spend all day out in pasture.</p><p>It's also possible your ponies will never be able to spend full days in lush pasture. Ponies can gain weight very easily, and you may need to restrict the grazing time to prevent them from gaining weight too quickly to the point of obesity. Founder is very common in ponies, and obesity can lead to problems such as metabolic syndrome and heart disease. To prevent these problems, allow your pony only short periods for lush grazing, with the bulk of their time spent in a much sparser area. Your pony will no doubt try to convince you that it's starving, but you're the best monitor of its actual condition. Most ponies canthrive on sparse rations and don't need any supplements or concentrates.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Equine metabolic syndrome is most clearly identified by obesity in a horse or pony, especially around the neck. It often is accompanied by the painful hoof inflammation of laminitis. Losing excess weight can be extremely difficult for a horse with metabolic syndrome, and it may require severe feed restrictions that deny the animal access to all grazing for a period of time. But do not attempt to diagnose metabolic syndrome yourself, as a definitive diagnosis requires lab tests to determine blood glucose levels and rule out PPID (a pituitary disease). Treatment and diet restrictions should be done under the supervision of an equine veterinarian.</p><h2>Horses </h2><p>Laminitis and obesity problems can occur in horses,too. Horses put out on lush pasture can suddenly develop problems, such as colic,as well as longer-term problems, like metabolic syndrome and founder.Introduce your horse gradually, starting with a half-hour and adding about 10 minutes every day, until you can leave your horse in the pasture for the entire day.It's a good idea to feed hay to your horse before turning it out, to prevent it from gorging on lush grass.</p><p>Keep in mind that having a completely empty stomach isn't good either, as this can possibly lead to EGUS (equine gastric ulcer syndrome)which leads to stomach ulcers. A horse's digestive system is made to digest small amounts of food over long periods of time. So, organize your horse's feeding routine so that it's neither feast nor famine.</p><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p>It's tempting to turn your horse out in the spring and watch it enjoy that beautiful green grass. However, doing so may endanger its health, or even foster potentially fatal diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. Err on the side of caution when introducing your horse to pasture. Go slowly and make sure that your horse or pony doesn't gorge on too much of a good thing.</p>",777
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-tell-a-horses-age-by-its-teeth-1887383,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>How to Tell a Horse's Age by Its Teeth</h1>,"<h1>How to Tell a Horse's Age by Its Teeth</h1><p>Many people think that you can tell a horse's age by its teeth. This isn't quite true. Horse's teeth aren't like the rings of a tree that show each year's growth. Telling a horse's age by its teeth is not 100 percent accurate, but it will give you an approximate range if you don't know the horse's actual date of birth. The younger the horse, the closer the teeth will match its real age. As horses age, many factors can affect the condition of the teeth and make it more difficult to estimate age. Things like basic maintenance, diet, grazing conditions, vices, and genetics all play a role in how the horse's teeth themselves are aging.</p><h2>Baby Horse Teeth </h2><p>Foals get their first milk or deciduous teeth shortly after birth. The final milk teeth are grown in by the time the foal is about nine months old. The first permanent teeth begin to grow in when the horse is between two and three years old. It's not unusual for a horse owner to find a shed tooth in a feeder or on the ground. The milk teeth are shed gradually, and all of the permanent teeth are grown in by around age five. Milk teeth are paler in color and shorter than permanent teeth.</p><h2>Adult Horse Teeth </h2><p>The eruption times of the upper central incisor (2.5 years), upper middle incisor (3.5 years) and upper corner incisor (4.5 years) for horses under 5 years of age is considered fairly accurate in determining a horses age.</p><p>The new permanent teeth are quite concave on their surfaces and these ""cups"" along with the angle, shape and a groove on the outer vertical surface of the upper corner incisor (UCI) that gradually grows out, called Galvayne's groove, are the indicators of how old a horse might be.</p><p>A ""hook"" located on the rear end of the UCI is often visible at age 6-7 years, and then again at age 11-13 years. Due to this variability in occurrence, it is not considered definitive in determining a horses age.<sup>2</sup></p><p>As the horse wears its teeth by grazing, the concave surfaces are worn flatter. By the time a horse is about 11 years old, it will have worn its teeth flat. How quickly this happens depends on the type of grazing it has available. Horses that graze grass on the sandy ground will wear their teeth flatter than those fed only hay grown on clay type soil.</p><p>At about age 10, the Galvayne's groove begins to appear at the gum line. This groove will continue to grow out so that reaches the entire length of the tooth. By about age 15, the groove will reach half-way down the tooth, and it will reach all the way down the tooth by age 19-20 years. By the time a horse is in its mid-20s the Galvayne's groove begins to disappear from the gum line, and if the horse lives long enough, will disappear completely as the tooth naturally wears away.</p><h2>Senior Horse Teeth </h2><h2>Extra Horse Teeth </h2><p>Some horses may grow wolf teeth and tushes or canines. These are extra teeth that grow in the toothless bar of the horse's mouth between the front teeth and back. Sometimes these teeth may have to be removed if they interfere with the bit or cause discomfort for the horse. These teeth usually come in by the time the horse is five years of age. Some horses will not have them at all, or for some, they may not be a problem.</p><h2>Care of Horse Teeth </h2><p>Because horse's teeth grow throughout most of their lifespan and may not wear evenly, your horse will need to be checked by a veterinarian or equine dentist about once per year. Your horse may need to be floated, removing by filing any sharp edges or hooks that will prevent him from chewing properly and holding a bit or wearing a hackamore comfortably.</p><h2>Detailed Diagrams and Explanations of Horse Teeth </h2><p>While this is a general description of aging horses by their teeth several university agricultural extensions have detailed fact sheets with diagrams that show horse's teeth at every stage of life. The PDF file from the University of Nevada Cooperative Extension is quite good and easy to print out so you can take it to the barn and compare pictures to actual teeth. The University of Missouri has a similar online resource with diagrams and explanations.</p>",756
52,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leg-markings-on-horses-1887398,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>Leg Markings on Horses</h1>,"<h1>Leg Markings on Horses</h1><p>Leg markings are areas of white hair that extend up from the hoof on an otherwise the dark-colored horse. There is so much variety in leg markings and so many unique combinations that leg markings are an important way to identify individual horses -- they're important enough that even old horse proverbs mention them. Horses may have four similar white markings on their legs, or the leg markings can be completely different on each leg. For example, a horse may have no white on one leg, a high stocking on another, a coronet on another and a sock on another. Leg and facial markings are sometimes passed on from one generation of horses to the next. For example, Arabian horses of Crabbet bloodlines often have wide white facial markings along with four white stockings. Horses with particularly flashy and eye-catching white on their legs are said to have ""chrome.""</p><h2>What Is Chrome </h2><p>Lots of chrome can present a grooming challenge. For a show, these flashy markings are sometimes tricky to keep clean and there aremany grooming tips to keep them white.</p><h2>Reasons for Accurate Documentation of Markings </h2><p>For breed registration and other official paperwork, you must accurately draw the markings on the documents you will submit. You may also have to write a description, and that means you have to use the right terminology. If your horse were to go missing, it's helpful to have clear photos that show its white markings, a written description, and you may need to be able to describe its markings accurately when giving information.</p><h2>Patterns of Markings </h2><p>Most often, if a horse has white leg markings, the hoof wall will be white too. Anywhere there is a patch of body hair or an ermine mark, there may be a dark stripe down the hoof. As grey horses age, the leg and facial markings may not be as obvious. However, they are still there, because the skin underneath white leg markings is pink, and the skin under the coat color will be grey. The shape of leg markings does not change though, regardless of the age of any colored horse. If a horse was born with four white stockings, the shape of the stockings will remain the same throughout the horse's life.</p><p>Occasionally, you'll see white markings on the legs that the horse wasn't born with. These white marks are from old injuries. Becausethey arepermanent,they too can be used as identifying marks.</p><h2>Coronet </h2><p>A coronet is a band of white hairs around the top of the hoof (the coronet band of the hoof) that does not extend up onto the pastern. If the coronet extends around the whole hoof, the hoof itself will likely be white. If there is a break in the white hairs where there is coat color, the hoof may have a dark stripe below it. If the white hairs only cover a small area just above the coronet band of the hoof, usually at the back the marking is called a heel or partial coronet.</p><h2>Socks </h2><p>Socks extend above the fetlock but not to the knee. Socks stop about half-way up to the canon bone on either the front or back legs. If the sock is solid white around the hoof, the hoof will most likely be white. If there is a patch of coat coloror an ermine just above the hoof, there may be a stripe of dark hoof below.</p><h2>Stockings </h2><p>Stockings extend to the knee or hock and above. They may end in a symmetrical or pattern, or they may extend further up the leg in a jagged ""irregular"" pattern. If they extend well past the knee or hock they are called ""high white.""</p><h2>Boot or Fetlock </h2><p>A boot or fetlock is white that extends up to, but only slightly past the fetlock joint. A partial fetlock means that only a portion of the fetlock joint is covered with white hair.</p><h2>Pastern </h2><p>A pastern marking covers the pastern area but does not extend beyond the fetlock joint.</p><h2>Ermines </h2><p>Ermines are random black spots that appear on white areas on the horse's body. They can appear on the horse's white leg markings, and if they are against the coronet band of the hoof, there may be a stripe of dark hoof wall on an otherwise white hoof. Ermines can also appear on horse's facial markings.</p>",718
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horse-facial-markings-1887393,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics,<h1>Horse Facial Markings</h1>,"<h1>Horse Facial Markings</h1><p>Although there are several basic facial markings on horses, each marking will be unique in shape to each horse. Like snowflakes, no two are precisely the same. This is useful for horse owners because it provides a means of accurate identification. If you need to fill out registration papers, or documents like Coggins Tests, facial markings will be part of the identifying markings recorded for your horse.</p><p>In ""The Black Stallion,"" the horse is a solid black Arabian. The role in the movie was filled by a horse named Cass Ole, a black Arabian stallion with a white star on his face. In some scenes, if you watch carefully, you can see the shadow of Cass Ole's white facial and leg markings under his stage ""make-up.""</p><h2>Star </h2><p>A star is a white spot on a horse's forehead, between the eyes. A faint star may only appear as a few white hairs, or the star can be large enough it covers the whole forehead area. Stars can be very symmetrical in shape, like spots or diamonds, or they may appear as irregular splotches.</p><p>Some stars extend down the bridge of the nose without connecting to any other facial markings. On gray horses, the star may be very obvious when the horse is young and disappear into the graying hair coat as the horse ages. The star may blend into the coat color, but the skin beneath the coat will be lighter in color.</p><h2>Snip </h2><p>A snip is a patch of white on the horse's nose. It may be a small spot between the nostrils, or it may extend over the whole nose. A snip might be connected to a blaze or stripe. Or, a horse may have a star and a snip.</p><h2>Strip </h2><p>A strip is a band of white that extends in a more or less even stripe down the bridge of the nose. A strip may connect to a star at the top and extend to the white markings on the horse's nose. Or they may be broken so there are three separate facial markings on the face, a star, strip and snip. The strip is quite narrow, only an inch or two wide and stays on top of the nasal bone. A strip may also be called a stripe.</p><h2>Blaze </h2><p>A blaze covers the whole bridge of the nose, from the forehead area, down to the nose. Blazes can be very symmetrical, or they can wander down the face unevenly. A blaze is much wider than the strip. The difference between a strip and a blaze is the width, as blazes cover most of the horse's face between the ridges of the bone. </p><h2>Bald </h2><p>A bald face is covered with a much wider white marking than a blaze. The white areas extend from the forehead to the nose, and from side to side beyond the eye area to the cheekbones. The whole nose and muzzle area can be white. It's not uncommon to see bald faced horses with blue eyes. Horses with a lot of white on their noses may be more prone to sunburn. Bald faces are common in some Paint and pinto horses as well as Clydesdales. There are specific names within some breeds for types of bald faces such as apron or medicine hat.</p><h2>Ermine </h2><p>An ermine is a small colored spot within any white area on the horse's face. Ermines may appear within a star or blaze. The may be round or very asymmetrical. Ermines also appear on leg markings. It's not unusual to see a black ermine on a lighter colored horse. These ermine spots are genetic. Dark spots within the coat color are calledBend-Or spots.</p><h2>Combinations </h2><p>Combinations of these markings result in horses' unique facial markings. Typical combinations include star and strip, star and snip, and star, strip and snip. These combinations are an important way to identify individualhorses. On medical records and breed registration records these identifying marks are photographed or drawn so that the horse's identitycan be verified.</p><p>If your horse suddenly develops white markings around the eyes these aren't likely to be permanent. White or pinkish areas may actually be a skin condition called Vitiligo. Scars too may leave white markings on a horse, but the skin beneath will not be lighter like a true marking the horse was born with.</p>",715
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-do-i-bond-with-my-horse-5442884,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Buying Your First Horse,<h1>How Do You Bond With Your Horse?</h1>,"<h1>How Do You Bond With Your Horse?</h1><p>Horses can be very loving and trusting creatures, but many are also wary or guarded. It is important to take the time to properly bond with your horse. Taking time in the beginning with a new horse can provide years of a beautiful relationship. If your horse isn't new, it's not too late! Bonding can drastically improve the quality of your relationship with your horse.<br/></p><h2>Why is it Important to Bond with My Horse? </h2><p>Domestic horses are dependent upon humans for survival. This fact puts these animals in a unique position of needing and wanting to bond and have a quality relationship with their humans. This is borne primarily from the horse's survival instinct.</p><p>However, bonding with a human also makes life more enjoyable for a horse. And this benefit goes both ways. Many scientific research studies have shown the human-animal bond's psychological and physical health benefits for humans.</p><h2>Ways To Bond with Your Horse </h2><h3>Know Your Horse </h3><p>The most important thing to remember when attempting to bond with your horse is that they are a horse. Horses are different than humans and require different strategies for successful bonding.</p><p>To bond with a horse, you need to speak their ""language."" This includes determining what motivates it and also things they dislike. For many horses, one of the best forms of positive reinforcement and praise comes in the form of food. Horses are often highly food motivated, and treats can be a great way to reinforce your bond with them. However, treats should not be the only reward method to bond with the horse, or they can get mouthy and aggressive when treats are not given. It is important to create an emotional connection with the horse through praise as well.<br/></p><p>It is also important to watch your horse for cues. Learning about the body language of horses is imperative as they cannot speak. Ear position, head carriage, tail movements, and body position are all ways horses use to communicate their feelings.</p><h3>Be Patient </h3><p>Bonding with your horse will not happen overnight. Horses learn to trust slowly, over time. The more time you can spend with your horse, the better.<br/></p><h2>Quality Time </h2><p>How you spend your time with your horse is essential too. Interactions with your horse under saddle are important but are often not the best encounters for bonding.</p><p>Spend time brushing, walking, talking to, and feeding your horse. It may not be possible for you to be the primary feeder, but animals form strong bonds with those that provide their food. If you can, be the person that feeds your horse its meals daily. If this isn't possible, always spend time taking them out to hand graze or bring it treats.<br/></p><h3>Location Is Important </h3><p>Like humans, horses have places they enjoy and others that cause them anxiety or fear. It is best to bond with your horse somewhere they are comfortable and happy. This may be their stall, their favorite outdoor paddock, or grazing.</p><p>High-stress situations, such as trailering or at competitions, are likely to be less conducive to bonding. Ideally, the positive experiences you have with your horse at home and in their happy places will allow you to be a comforting presence in stressful situations. However, always be cautious when a horse is stressed or sick because their behavior may be unpredictable.</p><p></p><h3>Opportunities for Bonding </h3><p>There are several opportunities for positive bonding with your horse throughout the course of normal daily interactions. You may also want to try to incorporate some of these additional bonding activities with your horse.</p><p>Hand Grazing  Taking your horse out to a nice grassy patch and allowing them to graze contentedly while you are near is a great way for both of you to relax and bond.</p><p>Grooming  Grooming your horse is one of the best ways to bond. Not only is grooming necessary for the health and hygiene of your horse, but it is also a pleasurable and relaxing experience for them as well. Brushing, cleaning their hooves, and maintaining their manes and tails are great ways to<br/>relax both you and your horse while also providing excellent bonding time.</p><p>Talk to your horse  Although horses cannot speak and likely do not understand any of what we say, talking to them is still essential to bonding. You want your horse to get to know your voice. With time, they will be able to decipher your emotions through the inflections in your voice. Remember, if your horse happens to do something that is undesired, never yell at them. Horses don't understand yelling, and it may result in them being fearful or upset.</p><p>Ground Training  Not all training has to be done under saddle. Ground training combines training for your horse with bonding time. Great bonding can occur when you are on the ground and visible to your horse. This can include halter work, lunging, and training the horse to accept farriers, veterinarians, and clipping.</p><p>Trail rides- Riding your horse day after day in the same location, especially if it is a boring arena, can be dissatisfying to both you and your horse. If possible, give both you and your horse a break and take a trail ride! Make the ride a fun and relaxing experience by going to new places and showing them new things. Take the opportunity to soothe and reassure your horse if you encounter any new or unfamiliar things on the trail, such as water, structures, or other animals.</p><h2>Things to Remember </h2><p>When bonding with your horse, there are key things that you should keep in mind. The most important is that bonding takes time. Do not get discouraged if it is taking longer than you expected. Stay consistent and positive, and allow the process to occur at a pace that is comfortable for your individual horse.</p><p>Food is important. Feeding your horse or giving them treats will definitely increase bonding. Ask your veterinarian about what treats they recommend, and always get medical advice before giving treats to a horse with a medical condition.</p><p>Always listen to your horse. They cannot talk, but horses will let you know how they are feeling through their body language. Pay attention, and use the horse's cues to guide your actions.<br/><br/>Move around to different places. Horses enjoy variety, and you will have more quality bonding time if you vary the places where you interact with your horse.<br/></p><h2>Final Thoughts </h2><p>Bonding with your horse is crucial. Keep in mind that the most significant component of bonding with a horse is time spent together. It is impossible to bond with your horse overnight, so be willing to put in the necessary time and try not to get frustrated. Always strive to have positive interactions with your horse on a consistent basis, and soon you will experience a strong and beautiful bond.</p><p>""The Human-Companion Animal Bond: How Humans Benefit"" ErikaFriedmannPhDHeesookSonMPH, RN</p><p>University of Maryland School of Nursing, 655 W.

55,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-horse-or-pony-buying-mistakes-1886210,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Buying Your First Horse,<h1>Mistakes People Make When Buying a First Horse</h1>,"<h1>Mistakes People Make When Buying a First Horse</h1><p>Buying a horse or pony for the first time is an exciting experience. However, it's essential to do prior research on the responsibilities, costs, and care a horse requires because the wrong horse can ruin the fun of horseback riding or driving and may be unsafe. Learn to avoid the top mistakes that new horse buyers make.</p><h3>Watch Now: Common Mistakes When Buying Your First Horse</h3><h2>Buying an Untrained Horse </h2><p>Many experienced horsemen and women will tell you they see this too often. Because untrained horses are often cheaper, or for whatever other whim, beginner riders will choose untrained horses. Don't buy a horse that you plan to train yourself or even send to a trainer. Training can take months. It can be dangerous if not done right. Young or inexperienced mature horses are not reliable. Beginners will be safer and happier with a horse they can enjoy the moment it gets off the trailer.</p><h2>Turning Down Older Horses</h2><p>An older horse, who has seen the world, makes a great beginner horse. Beginners might shy away from a horse into their late teens and twenties. However, many healthy, sound horses can be ridden well into their senior years. In fact, light daily exercise, such as a quiethack or drive may be beneficial to both horse and rider/driver.</p><h2>Buying a Young Horse for Their Children to Grow up With </h2><p>This is a romantic notion, but the reality is that young horses and young beginner riders or drivers are not a safe mix. Buy your kids a mature, well-trained horse they can saddle or harness up the same day you bring it home. Buy a horse that knows how to handle itself when all the scary aspects of the world present themselvesbecause a young beginner won't know how. On an older, well-trained horse or pony, kids will learn and have fun in greater safety.</p><h2>Buying at Auction </h2><p>It takes a keen eye to pull a good horse out of an auction. Horses can appear docile at auction because they are so confused they ""freeze."" Horses can be drugged to make them look calm or healthy. Things like heaves and lameness can be hidden easily with drugs.</p><h2>Impulse Buying </h2><p>Don't buy a horse at first sight. Try the horse out, try it again, ask lots of questions. Go home and think about it for a few days. Look at other horses besides the one you're smitten with and make comparisons. Be absolutely sure you've chosen the horse most suitable for you.</p><h2>Not Asking for a Trial Period </h2><p>Don't be afraid to ask the seller for a trial period. Most private owners want their horses to go to good homes, and are confident about the type of person they feel can handle the horse. Some dealers may agree on a trial period, or help you find another horse if the one you are looking at doesn't work out. Just ask. And if you get a 'no' answer, ask why. There may be a valid reason.</p><h2>Buying ""Too Much Horse"" </h2><p>You may envision yourself jumping five-foot concrete culverts in a cross country event. However, the reality is you've only been riding six months. The type of horse required for high-performance sports may not be the one suitable for safe learning. Buy a horse to match your skill and fitness level, not one to match a dream that may not come true for five years or even vanish.</p><h2>Buying a Horse to Breed </h2><p>Do you want to buy a horse so you can breed it and have a foal? Before you do visit an auction where horses are destined for rendering or meat. Pay attention to how many look like the result of backyard breeding experiments. Consider if you can live with this outcome for a horse you have brought into this world. Horses should be bred because they have outstanding qualities to pass on. The fact that you love it or think it would have a really cute foal is not outstanding quality.</p><h2>Buying a Horse of a Particular Color </h2><p>While it is perfectly reasonable to want to own a special coat pattern horse like a Paint, palomino or Appaloosa, it isn't wise to buy for color only. If you have a choice of several horses, and all are of the same sane mind, and good training, of course, buy the color you like. However, don't base your decision on the color if the mind and training aren't suitable. When buying a car the adage is ""you don't drive the paint."" With horses, you don't ride/drive the color.</p><h2>Not Considering the Time and Expense of Horse Care</h2><p>Horse ownership is a big responsibility. Horses don't stop eating and drinking on the weekend when you want to go away. The expenses don't stop because you want to spend the money elsewhere, or you've been unable to work. Be honest about the time and money you are able to spend on a horse. It's okay to admit you love horses, but would rather spend $30 on atrail ride or riding lesson occasionally and leave all the other expense and fuss to someone else.</p>",850
56,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-do-horses-cost-1886151,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Buying Your First Horse,<h1>How Much Do Horses Cost?</h1>,"<h1>How Much Do Horses Cost?</h1><p>Horses can cost anywhere from $500 to $3,000 depending on their pedigree, performance record, and good manners. The bigger the budget, the more options you have as a horse owner to choose from. Besides the initial purchase of the horse itself, there are costs towards hay, feed, veterinary exams, training, and grooming.</p><p>Horses that are $10,000 and up are horses are being bought and sold by top-name stud farms for use in high-level competition. They are often imported from Europe or elsewhere, with impressive bloodlines, and have antecedents with international competition success. They're not likely to be purchased by the average first-time horse owner, and the prices aren't as impacted by market forces as the backyard riding horse prices are.</p><p>It's important to calculate costs before committing to buying a horse especially if it's your first time. Besides upkeeping costs, there are also transportation costs and sales tax to consider. While these won't be part of the asking price, they are things you need to think about as you make a final decision.</p><h2>How Upkeep Costs Affect Price </h2><p>Poor hay crops and rising feed and fuel costs can affect the number of horses for sale and can affect the asking prices of those horses in any given year. The side effect of the banning of horses for meat slaughter is a lower price for some types of horses. This mainly affects horses that are elderly, unsound, young and/or untrained, but it does have a ripple effect on the general horse market.</p><p>Those looking for a first-time horse will probably need to have anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 in their budget for the purchase. You may be able to find a gem for less than this, but having that amount will give you the greatest number of choices. The more you have to spend, the more choices you will have.</p><h2>The Cost of Ponies </h2><p>Ponies might be smaller in stature than horses, but that doesn't mean their purchase or upkeep costs are proportionally smaller.</p><p>The cost of a good pony can be the same or higher than a horse. Expect prices forsuitable first poniesto be about $1,000 and upwards.</p><h2>The Real Cost of a Free Horse </h2><p>A free horse will probably live up to the old adage, ""Never look a gift horse in the mouth."" Usually, the horse will be a senior citizen, a youngster with poor prospects or little training, or a horse with behavioral issues. Yes, it's possible to get a really great free horselike a senior citizen who is level-headed and serviceably sound, whose owner just wants a nice retirement home for it. However, these horses are rare and there's a possibility you're taking on someone's problem.</p><p>You might also take on a horse with a health or soundness problem, which can cost you lots of money, even though the initialpurchase price was low.</p><h2>Training and Types of Horses </h2><p>Likewise, with a $500 to $1,000 horse, these are often youngsters with little training or handling; or horses with soundness, conformation, or behavioral issues. Of course, there's the exception to every rulethere are gems among lower-priced or giveaway horses, but it may take a keen eye and willingness to deal with difficult issues. There are many stories of people taking these 'sows ears' and making them into 'silk purses.' They might not be the right horses for first-time horse owners, however. A cheap horse may be more expensive in the long run if you have to contend with vet bills, specialized shoeing, and paying trainers.</p><p>The way to make a horse worth more money is to ensure it is well trained, healthy, sound, and well behaved. Bloodlines and conformation are important too, but it's easy to forgive a horse's obscure bloodlines and less than perfect conformation if it is a willing worker that is safe to be around and fun to ride. By buying a horse in the $1,500-and-up range, you are probably buying a horse that has had the time and money put into it that makes it a nice horse to own. It may have a good show record and probably is easy to clip, bathe, load on a trailer, stand for the farrier and veterinarian, and has all the good manners that make a horse fun and easy to handle.</p><p>The better the horse's pedigree and performance record, the more the asking price will be. Again, there is an exception to every rule. However, having a bigger budget means that you have more choices and are able to pass up the unsuitable horses without too much regret.</p><p>As you calculate how much you think you'll need to buy a horse, make sure you include sales taxes, transportation costs, and a pre-purchase veterinary exam. Make sure you have money to look after your horse and consider how you'll deal with veterinary emergencies if they arise. The initial cost of a horse may seem like a large expense but the day-to-day care really is the greater expense of horse ownership.</p>",824

Since they're significantly smaller, it's easy to mistake ponies for baby horsesand it's common for many people to do so. However, ponies are not the same as foals, and they have unique purposes in the equestrian world.</p><h3>What is a Pony Horse?</h3><p>A pony is a small horse measuring less than 4 feet tall. While they look like mini versions of regular horses, ponies have a different temperament and sturdier builds than most full-size horses.</p><p>Both horses and ponies are of the same species () and come from the exact same family tree. However, ponies stay small their whole life, maturing more quickly than horses. Pony foals are tiny and rapidly mature to the approximate size of their parents. Horses are slower growing, some not attaining their full mature size until they are six or seven years of age.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>The most obvious difference between a horse and a pony is size. For most purposes, a pony is under 14.2 hands high if you ride English, and under 14 hands if you're a western rider. This size distinction varies between places, too, and often they are arbitrary sizes set for the show ring. Some horses are more pony-ish in their behavior and physiology, and some ponies more horse-like. In fairness to the riders and these mounts, these size standards help prevent ponies and small horses from showing against larger animals whose size might give them an advantage. It also isn't safe to have very small children on tiny ponies riding around the same ring with larger horses.</p><h2>Pony-Size Horses </h2><p>Some breeds that are under the 14.2/14 hand mark are considered horses. Examples would be the Miniature Horse and the Icelandic Horse. Both are the size of ponies but are called horses. In the case of the Miniature Horse, most will have small ponies, such as Shetlands in their pedigrees, and it's unlikely to find any actual horse breeds. Others like the Welsh Pony will have individuals above the pony height standards, but may still be regarded as a pony. Some horse breeds have individuals of pony size, such as the Morgan Horse, American Quarter Horse, and many gaited breeds such as the Paso Fino and Kentucky Mountain Horse.</p><h2>Defining Characteristics </h2><p>Some differences between horses and ponies may not be as easy to spot as the size. Horses and ponies often have very different temperaments. Ponies tend to be more stoic and intelligent than larger horses. It's a mistake to see this as docility. They can be quite wily, which is why it's sometimes easier to find a quiet horse for a child than a reliable pony. Ponies are very adept at avoiding work and withstanding the consequences. Horses can be quieter, and often the larger the breed, the more docile they are. This depends largely on what the horse breed was developed for.</p><p>Ponies are incredibly strong for their size. They can pull or carry heavy loads with more strength than a horse, relative to their size. They are hardier than horses and can withstand greater ranges in temperature. Their coats tend to grow thicker in the winter, which often doesn't shed out until the hottest days of summer. They begin to grow back their thick coats as soon as the days start to shorten. Ponies have thicker manes and tails.Their hooves tend to be tougher. They are heavier boned and shorter legged in proportion to their bodies compared to horses.</p><h2>Digestion </h2><p>Ponies can eke out nutrition from a pasture that a horse would starve on. In fact, it's very easy to overfeed a pony, which makes them more prone to founder and laminitis than horses. Feeding a pony takes a slightly different approach than feeding horses. While some horses can be'hard keepers' most ponies are the extreme opposite, apparently putting on weight just looking at the grass on the other side of the fence. A pony that is a hard keep is rare, and it may be an indication of a health problem.</p><p>Ponies also tend to live longer than horses.It's not unusual for ponies to live beyond thirty years of age, and many world record holders for the oldest equines are ponies. Many ponies are still used for riding and driving into their late 20s.</p>",713

Learn how to determine if you should get a horse, how to buy, lease, adopt or even get a horse for free.</p><h2>Basic Equipment </h2><p>If you want to get a horse, you have to first be sure that you are ready, both financially and time-wise to care for a horse once it's yours. No matter how you go about getting a horse, the horse will require a consistent amount of work and money to care for. There are a few basic pieces of equipment you'll need.</p><p>Since getting a horse is a large expense in dollars and time, you don't want to make the common mistakes that first-time horse owners often do.</p><h2>Purchasing </h2><p>The most obvious way to get a horse is to buy one. You can find horses for sale from private owners and dealers. The purchase price of horses varies.</p><p>Generally, the better trained they are, the more expensive they become. There are many factors that affect the price of horses, so do your research and choose carefully within your budget. If you are a first-time horse owner, it's probably best to avoid buying at an auction and keep in mind the horse world has its share of selling scams.</p><p>Most horse dealers and owners are honest and want the best for the horse. As in buying anything else, do your research. Keep in mind that no matter what the price is, the responsibility and expense will be the same.</p><h2>For Free </h2><p>Sometimes, people who own older horses are glad to place them in good semi-retirement homes. This can be great for a beginner, who will receive use of a well-trained and behaved horse.</p><p>These older horses may require a bit of extra carebut are worth it for what they can teach a beginner rider or driver. Occasionally, you may get a free horse from a rescue organization. If you live near a race track, you might hear of off-the-track thoroughbreds or standardbreds being given away.</p><p>These horses are generally unsuitable for beginners. Remember though, that, even if you get a free horse, it will still take the same amount of responsibility, time and expense as a horse bought for $100,000.</p><h2>Leasing </h2><p>It is possible to lease the use of a horse. While you lease the horse, it's usual that you cover all the expenses of its care. Quite often, show horses are leased.</p><p>Leasing can be a fairly costly option, although it may allow you to ride a horse you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford. You'll probably be expected to agree to a detailed contract that outlines what is expected of both the owner and you.</p><h2>Part Boarding </h2><p>Part-boarding is an option at many boarding stables. The owner shares the use of the horse for a set fee per month. Part-boarding contracts vary but be sure that you and the horse owner are clear as to how much you may use the horse, and what other responsibilities and expenses you can expect.</p><h2>Convincing Your Parents </h2><p>For those of you who are young and still living at home, convincing your parents might be the first step in getting a horse. To convince your parents to get you a horse be prepared to prove you are responsible by studying hard, doing your chores and being smart with your money.</p><p>Alternatively, if you are a parent you may be wondering if your child is ready for a horse and what type of horse or pony you should buy.</p><h2>Adoption </h2><p>Right now, horse rescue organizations are filled with horses their owners had to give up for one reason or another. Many horses end up in horse rescues because of behavioral, health or soundness problems or their owners have run into financial problems.</p><p>Most often there is a small fee of a few hundred dollars and a contract you must sign. You may have to agree to return the horse to the rescue within a certain time frame if you can't keep it. Rescues are usually very careful in matching up horses to humans that can cope with their needs.</p><p>Ex-racehorses like thoroughbreds, standardbreds and wild horses can be adopted, but are often unsuitable for beginners as they have had relatively little training as a riding horse.</p>",702
59,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-do-i-bond-with-my-horse-1886822,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Buying Your First Horse,<h1>How Do I Bond With My Horse?</h1>,"<h1>How Do I Bond With My Horse?</h1><p>When you get a new horse it is natural that you want to bond with it. Hopefully, your new horse means the start of a new and exciting relationship. Your horse won't automatically fall in love with you like you likely will with it, as relationships can take time. Here are ways to help create a bond between you and your new horse.</p><h2>Firm, Fair and Consistent </h2><p>Just like with children, you should be firm, fair and consistent.At all times, you should be firm in your leadership. Communicate clearly and firmly your expectations regarding your horse's manners and behavior. If you ask your horse to step over five steps, and your horse knows how to do that, don't let away with five steps over and three steps back.</p><p>But be fair. Don't expect a horse to do anything it is not trained or physically able to do. And be consistent. When you ask your horse to back up, do it, in the same way, every time. Feed it at the same time. Use the same aids and cues each time you work with your horse. Horses are creatures of habit and like predictability.</p><h2>Don't Just Show Up for ""Work Times"" </h2><p>Showing up just for riding or driving time can be a temptation given the busy schedule most of us have. But try to take time just to visit. Simple things like hand grazing in a bit of lush grass they normally can't get to, scratching bellies or necks and just hanging out together is a relaxing way to bond.</p><h2>Bring Treats </h2><p>There are horse people out there who are against feeding treats. But horses exist solely for our pleasure, and most of us like to see our horses enjoy a treat. The key to feeding treats is to be sure you are consistent in feeding your treats safely.</p><h2>Understand Body Language </h2><p>Understanding your horse's body language and shaping your body language will help you communicate with your horse and create a closer bond. This has to be done with consistency, however. Something like ""join up"" or other behaviors you have taught won't be permanent if your horse never knows what to expect next from you. Learn to understand what your horse is thinking by observing their facial expressions (yes, horses do have them), ears, tail, and posture.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Allogrooming is a common behavior seen in horses. Allogrooming is when two horses nibble along each other's crest and back, mutually 'grooming' and scratching each other (humans allogroom too, like when two girls do each other's hair). Grooming your horse is a pleasant way to bond. Your horse will appreciate it when you can brush areas it can't get to, like its chest, belly and between the legs.</p><h2>Respect </h2><p>Respect that your horse is a horse, not a human or a big dog. While your horse will learn to enjoy spending time with you, it will also need the companionship of other horses. Horses don't care about the same things we docolor-coordinated gear, winning prizes, or perfectly kept stalls. They want shelter from bad weather, good pasture, water, and companionship and leadership from someone they can trust.</p><h2>Massage and Other Comforts </h2><p>Learning the basics of equine massage or other therapeutic touches can help you bond with your horse. If your horse knows he can rely on you for relaxation, it will enjoy time with you. Not only will your horse enjoy it, but it may also enhance his or her performance. Many horses learn to lean into the pressure of massage or even chiropractic work, indicating where they need work.</p><h2>Experience Things Together </h2><p>Just like a shared experience between people can bring them closer together, so can sharing experiences with your horse. The more you train, ride or drive your horse, the more you and your horse will learn to understand each other. You might here competitors claim their horse looked after them during a competition, even though they didn't feel at the top of their game. Their bond with their horse developed based on mutual trust in sometimes difficult conditions.</p>",676
60,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horse-teeth-1885784,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>Learn About Your Horse's Teeth</h1>,"<h1>Learn About Your Horse's Teeth</h1><h2>Types of Teeth, Common Problems, and Dental Care</h2><p>Take a look in your horse's mouth and you'll see a lot of teeth in there. On average, horses have between 36 and 42 teeth. The number is dependent on the sex of the horse, and whether or not the horse develops extra teeth along the bars of its mouththe empty space between the front teeth and rear teeth where the bit sits.</p><p>Your horse also has a number of different types of teeth. And, throughout its life, it will have two different sets of teeth, just like humans. Specific wear and growth patterns can help you determine the approximate age of a horse.</p><h2>Deciduous (Baby) Teeth </h2><p>The deciduous teeth, or milk or baby teeth, are the first set of teeth that grow in a foal's mouth. These teeth may be apparent when the foal is born. Shortly after the young horse's second birthday, these teeth are pushed out by the permanent adult teeth as they grow in. There are 24 in all and they are usually replaced entirely by the time the horse is about 5 years old. Occasionally, a young horse may need help shedding baby teeth. The caps, as they are called, may not fall out as they should, and may have to be removed by a veterinarian or equine dentist.</p><h2>Permanent Teeth </h2><p>The permanent or adult teeth continue to grow for most of the horse's life. These are the ones we look to when we want tolearn the approximate age of a horse. When a horse gets really old, the tooth growth ends, and the horse may develop gaps where teeth fall out. This can lead to problems like weight loss and quidding.</p><h2>Wolf and Canine Teeth </h2><p>As the foal matures to 4 or 5years of age, some horses may get extra teeth in the inter-dental gap that we call the bars of the mouth. Canine and wolf teeth are slightly more common in stallions and geldings than in mares, where they will also appear smaller in size. They may only grow into the upper jaw, or they may grow in both theupper and lower jaw. Because these teeth can cause discomfort, especially when holding a bit, they can be removed. These teeth can sit beneath the gums in some horses, be quite small, or get quite pronounced.</p><h2>Incisors </h2><p>Your horse's front teeth are called incisors. These teeth efficiently clip the grassas it grazes. These are also the first teeth to appear as the milk teeth grow in and the first to shed as the permanent teeth push through. These teeth are the easiest to see, so it's from these that a horse's age is estimated.</p><p>These teeth can continue togrow to replace the gradual erosion caused by cropping fodder that has grit and other abrasives. Incisors can also be damaged by blows that can crack the tooth, just like human teeth can be damaged. All horse teeth are deeply rooted, and the roots can curve well back into the jaw bone. Horses have six incisors top and bottom for a total of 12.</p><h2>Premolars and Molars </h2><p>The premolars or cheek teeth sit directly behind the bars of the mouth. These teeth help to grind food before it is gathered into a bolus at the back of the throat and swallowed. The cheek teeth are wider than the incisors. A horse moves its jaws sideways to grind grass, hay, or grains. These teeth convert fodder like grass or hay into a 1/2 inch long. If you see pieces of grass or hay in a horse's manure that are longer, it could indicate a dental problem that is making it hard for your horse to chew properly. All of your horse's teeth grow about 1/6 inch per year. The amount of wear depends on the type of soil the horse is grazing onand the type of fodder, as well as the health, habits, and genetics of the horse itself.</p><p>Premolars and molars are very deeply rooted in the horse's jaw bone. In the lower jaw, these teeth extend to the bottom of the bone. There arethree premolars and three molars,located at the top and bottom, for a total of 24. Very rarely, a horse may have an extra molar.</p><h2>Tooth Types and Their Uses </h2><p>Incisors are used for clipping grass and picking up food. Premolars are used for grinding it all up before the horse swallows. But teeth have two other uses. Teeth can be used as a weapon. A horse may nip if annoyed or may bite hard if it is defending itself from or attacking other horses or predators. Horses may play bite and this is common in youngsters.</p><p>Teeth are also a grooming tool. They can be used to scratch anitch or may be used in social grooming referred to as allogrooming. This iswhen horses nibble on each other along the top of the neck, withers, back, and hindquarters.</p><p>Some horses are clever at using their teeth and lips to unfasten door latches or untie knots in ropes or may enjoy carrying objects around with their teeth.</p><h2>Common Dental Problems </h2><p>Horses are prone to several tooth problems. These problems can result in poor health, weight loss, difficulty wearing a bit, and behavior or performance problems when ridden or driven. Horses can have cracked, loose, or broken teeth from an accident. Baby teeth may not shed properlyand could need the attention of an equine dentist or veterinarian. Uneven wear can cause sharp edges and hooks that require smoothing down to prevent irritation to the inside of the cheeks or tongue. Some horses have misaligned jaws that can be undershot or overshot, also called parrot mouth, which can cause wear and chewing problems.</p><p>Teeth can become infected and abscesses in the jaw can form if debris or plaque causes problems. Because the roots of some of the molars extend near the sinus cavity, some infections can appear to be sinus problems. The yellowish or brownish color of the teeth is normal. The teeth do not stay pearly-white because they become stained by the food eaten. However, the gums should appear healthy pink. Any change of color can mean a health problem or a specific dental problem.</p><h2>Dental Care </h2><p>Horses need regular dental check-ups just like people do. The frequency that a dentist or veterinarian needs to check a horse's mouth depends on the horse. Generally, once a year is sufficient. Butsome horses, because of ongoing problems or the shape and size of its mouth, may need more frequent checks. When your horse's teeth are checked, its age will be taken into account, since some problems such as caps, hooks, and points are related to age. Your horse may need a bit seat, or even need teeth removed. And when an older horse starts having problems grinding food due to worn or missing teeth, a veterinarian can help you determine the best diet for your horse.</p>",1146
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/treating-minor-horse-wounds-1886865,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>Treating Minor Horse Wounds</h1>,"<h1>Treating Minor Horse Wounds</h1><p>It's inevitable that your horse will get scratched, cut, or bruised at some point. Horses squabble in their pastures, get caught on twigs or fence rails, or may scrape themselves on gates or stall walls. Most often, these minor wounds heal quickly with no further problem. It is important, however, to know the difference between a minor nick, cut, bruise, or scrape, and a wound that needs the attention of a veterinarian. With a basic first aid kit, you will be able to treat most minor injuries yourself. It is also important that your horse has an annual tetanus shot.</p><h2>Assessing the Wound </h2><p>It's easy to panic when you see a cut in your horse's otherwise perfect coat, or blood trickling down a leg. But keeping a cool head will help you assess whether you have an emergency or a situation you can deal with yourself.</p><p>If your horse is eating, moving, and otherwise acting normally, and TPR (temperature, pulse, and respiration) values are normal, chances are good that all will be well. If the horse appears to be in pain, or the bleeding does not stop after a reasonable time, or any other abnormal behavior worries you, your veterinarian is your best advisor. Always keep your vet's number handy.</p><p>While you are waiting for the vet, either safely tie or stable your horse, and ensure that both of you remain calm. Remember, however, that if your horse is acting in a manner that may injure you, you must keep yourself safe first.</p><h2>Scrapes </h2><p>The most common pasture injuries are scrapes. Scrapes occur for many reasons and can result in the shearing offof the hair and a bit of skin. Sometimes, just the hair will be missing, or the scrape may go a bit deeper, leaving a red inflamed bald area. These scrapes usually heal easily on their own without considerable scarring. When they only affect the topmost layer of the skin, they are unlikely to become infected.</p><p>First-aid for minor scrapes entails cleaning the area with clean water. A good rinse from the hose does a good job of washing off any excess dirt and grit. An antibiotic ointment usually isn't necessary for a superficial wound, as this may trap dirt at the site. Frequently, it's best to allow very superficial, minor skin scrapes to heal naturally. If a scrape with redness and/or swelling is under the saddle or girth area, it may be best to let the area heal a bit before riding the horse.</p><h2>Minor Cuts </h2><p>Cuts can be more serious. Their severity depends on their location, how contaminated they are when you find them, and how deep they go into the tissue. If the cut is small and shallow, it can be flushed out with saline or clean water. Ask your vet though, before applying any ointments or salves to an open wound. If you're not careful, some ointments actually delay the healing process. Deeper cuts may need dressing to keep the tissue clean during the first week or so of healing, although it can be difficult to keep a bandage in placeon some areas of the horse's body. On legs, a gauze dressing kept on with a regularly changed leg wrap usually works nicely.</p><p>Check cuts twice daily for any signs of swelling or foul discharge, as these signs can indicate infection. Depending on the length and depth of the cut, it may have to be stitched by a veterinarian. Stitches will decrease overall healing time and reduce scarring. If you can, clean the area of any dirt, and wait for the veterinarian. Again, consider your own safety first. If the horse won't tolerate you touching the area, the vet may need to administer a sedative to keep the horse calm during treatment. A horse with a deeper cut would also benefit from a tetanus booster.</p><h2>Deep Cuts </h2><p>Larger, deeper cuts will require veterinary treatment. Wire or splintered fence rails, firm branches, and other sharp objects can cause deep cuts. Situations for which a veterinarian should be called immediately involve any large wound, a wound with excessive bleeding or bleeding that will not stop, wounds involving a joint or eye, or a wound that is resulting in visible pain or lameness in your horse. Additionally, if any other situation involving a break in your horse's skin causes you to worry, there's no harm in calling your vet for medical advice.</p><p>Some large lacerations may develop a complication while healing called proud flesh. Also called equine exuberant granulation tissue, proud flesh is excessive tissue that can impair normal healing of the wound, and which can be unsightly. Proper wound management (including bandaging) can help to reduce the development of proud flesh, and if it does develop, your veterinarian can help to reduce its growth.</p><h2>Puncture Wounds </h2><p>Puncture wounds can look small and seem harmless, but because of their depth and the potential for life-threatening infection, they should always be considered seriously. Punctures can occur anywhere on the body, including the sole of the hoof and coronet band along the top of the hoof. Because they are hard to clean out, harmful bacteria can grow deep within the tissue and cause infection. If you suspect a puncture wound on your horse, call your veterinarian. Because puncture wounds need to heal from the inside out, proper treatment is required to prevent the outside of the puncture from healing over, and possibly trapping bacteria within. A tetanus booster should be given to any horse that has had a puncture wound.</p><h2>Bruising </h2><p>Bruising or swelling under the skin can be caused when a horse bumps into a solid object like a fence post or stall door, or is kicked by another horse. Most bruises heal on their own. Cold water hosing of the affected area a few times of day can help to ease the horse's discomfort. Stone bruising on the soles of the hooves may indicate that a change in hoof trimming/shoeing methods is required.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Once you have had the vet out or administered first aid, check your pastures and fences for anything that could have caused the injury. Sometimes horses have to be separated if they are fighting, to the point of hurting each other.This way you may be able to prevent future injuries.</p>",1042

63,https://www.thesprucepets.com/importance-of-turnout-for-your-horse-1886932,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>Why Turnout Is Important for Your Horse</h1>,"<h1>Why Turnout Is Important for Your Horse</h1><p>Horses are healthiest and happiest outdoors in their pastures. There are a number of reasons why your horse should be outside as much as possible. Although many horses will clamor to come into a stable during nasty weather, it's important that they live outdoors as much as possible.</p><p>Sometimes keeping your horse confined in a stall is necessary, such as when a veterinarian prescribes stall rest. Other than that, turnout is crucial to your horse's health and well-being.</p><h3>What Is Turnout?</h3><p>Turnout is the act of taking a horse from its stall to a dedicated pasture or field. Turning out your horses on a regular basis allows them to maintain their health through exercise, play, and social interaction with other horses.</p><h2>Hoof Health </h2><p>Blood circulation is essential for hoof health, and horses may not get enough exercise standing in a stall. Standing in bedding soiled with manure and urine can also lead to hoof problems like thrush and white line disease.</p><p>Hoof growth and strength may be compromised if horses are left to stand in a stall for long periods of time, especially if the bedding is left damp. Exercise encourages natural hoof growth.</p><h2>Leg Health </h2><p>Horses standing in stalls may develop stocked up legs, which is a condition where the legs swell, usually below the knee joints. It's noticeable on all four legs and dissipates when the horse is allowed to move around (which is how to determine whether it's stocking or an injury causing the swelling).</p><p>Leg injuries occur when horses that are frustrated about staying in kick stall walls or hay feeders. Impatient horses can hurt their front legs by pawing and wear their hooves unevenly.</p><h2>Boredom </h2><p>Horses are intelligent herd animals and will grow restless and bored if confined individually indoors for long periods of time. A horse may entertain itself by chewing stall walls. Cribbing is a stereotypic behavior as a way to cope with stress in which a horse places its top incisors onto an upright object such as a fence post or stall door and arches its neck while inhaling. The horse may walk the perimeter of its enclosure, known as stall walking, an obsessive-compulsive habit that can lead to other health problems (if a horse is stall-walking constantly, it's not eating or resting).</p><p>While not all of these so-called ""vices"" are solely caused by stabling, keeping a horse indoors where it will be bored and unable to expend energy can exacerbate any bad habits the horse may have.</p><h2>Companionship </h2><p>Horses are herd animals. Keeping horses separated in stalls, where they are not able to see and interact with each other can be very stressful. Outdoor pasture, even if horses are kept in separate paddocks but can still see each other, is better for the mental health of your horses. Being allowed to run or trot with other horses is even better.</p><h2>Digestive Health </h2><p>Horses who live outside tend to have fewer episodes of colic than horses who are kept in a stall. A University of Nottingham study suggests that stalled horses may be more prone to colic and that the lack of movement slows the motility of the gut, leading to impaction colic, which is similar to low motility issues suffered by sedentary humans.</p><p>Horses that are outside with room to roam tend to develop colic less often than stabled horses. The same slowed motility that can lead to impaction colic in stabled horses may contribute to equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS), a painful gut condition.The mental stress of being stabled for long periods of time may also play a role.</p><h2>Respiratory Health </h2><p>Ammonia fumes that develop as manure, bedding, and urine decompose (a process that takes a surprisingly short time), can damage your horse's airway. Ammonia is caustic and is not only offensive to smell, but can also increase your horse's risk of pneumonia or recurrent airway obstruction (RAO).Dust also can increase your horse's susceptibility to chronic inflammatory airway disease.</p><p>Even in a well-ventilated barn, stale air can cause problems. Horses breathe easier outdoors.</p><h2>Behavior </h2><p>Bored, energetic horses that are kept in stalls may not only develop troublesome vices, but they may also misbehave as they find creative ways to burn off excess energy. Horses may act out by kicking at stall walls, snapping at by-passers, or chewing or biting anything within reach.</p><p>When being handled, an energetic, bored horse may try to bite its handler, paw and kick out when tied or have a hard time standing still to be groomed or saddled.</p><p>When it comes time to ride, you will find your horse may act out by pulling, bucking, or being inattentive to your commands. Horses that can move naturally outdoors are more relaxed and have less pent-up energy, which may make them easier to handle and ride.</p><p>Weather and health issues can make the stable the best place for your horse sometimes. But allow your horse as much turnout time as possible.</p>",883

Some will train or ride in an arena, or others will enjoy a winterytrail ride, perhaps through freshly fallen snow. Exercise, especially with a thick winter hair coat, can make horses sweat, even in the cold weather. Traveling through snow can be hard work for a horse, so your horse may sweat, even if you are going slow. There's nothing wrong with that, as long as you take care to cool your horse out properly and make sure you dry its sweat-dampened coat out before leaving your horse out in the cold.</p><h2>Cooling out After a Ride </h2><p>The process for cooling a horse out after you ride in the winter is much the same as it would be any other time of the year. During your cool down, however, you might want to cover your horse with a moisture-wicking sweat sheet over its haunches (the biggest muscles) so it doesn't get chilled by the cold air. The easiest way to begin cooling out is to walk your horse for about ten to twenty minutes, depending on how long and hard you've been riding. This allows the heat generated in the horse's core and muscles to disperse. Keep an eye on your horse's respiration rate, as this will give you a guideline as to whether it has recovered from the workout. Once the horse is breathing at a normal resting rate, you can dismount.</p><p>After dismounting, un-do your girth or cinch. Leave the saddle and blanket or pad on, so the cold air doesn't hit your horse's back too quickly. Continue walking with your horse covered shoulders to haunches in a moisture-wicking sheet. Then remove your saddle, and cover the horse with the sheet. If the sheet becomes damp, replace it with a dry one. When the horse begins to dry, you can put him in the cross-ties or stall.</p><h2>Toweling </h2><p>Toweling helps to dry a damp horse's coat faster. Rub your horse all over with moisture-absorbing toweling. Replace the towels as they get damp. It's handy to have a stack of old towels around if you ride a lot in the winter. A combination of keeping the horse covered by a sheet and vigorous toweling can wick the moisture away from the coat quickly. Just uncover the horse where you are rubbing its coat dry, and recover it when you are done. This taking off and replacing the blanket as you work is sometimes called ""quartering.""</p><h2>Blanketing </h2><p>A thick coat may be difficult to dry during the winter. And, if your horse wears a blanket normally when turned out, it may be very uncomfortable for it if a blanket is put on before the horse is thoroughly dry.A thick blanket may hold dampness against the skin, which can cause the horse to become chilled.</p><p>There are blankets made to allow airflow between the blanket and the horse. These blankets are made to stand away from the horse's coat, so they don't sit directly on the horse. Another method to encourage airflow, while keeping the horse dry is to stuff about a four-inch layer of loose hay or straw under the horse's blanket. The horse dries beneath and the straw or hay falls out after a time. If you've put the stuffing beneath your horse's regular blanket, and your horse is dry, check to see that all of it has fallen out and that there's none left rubbing uncomfortably under a tight spot under the blankets.</p><h2>Rubbing Alcohol </h2><p>Some people use a spray bottle of rubbing alcohol to help their horses dry out, or rub the alcohol into the coat with a cloth. Rubbing alcohol can be drying to the skin and coat, and used often can cause skin irritation. But the process is to spray or apply the alcoholand then rub the hair dry. The alcohol should help the sweat dry quickly.</p><h2>Consider Clipping </h2><p>If you plan to ride a lot in the winter, clipping your horse may be a good idea. A clipped horse must be blanketed at all times during the cold weather because you've taken away its natural insulation. Clipped horses will also have to be stabled in severe weather.</p><p>Clipping under the belly and neck in an under-belly neck clip or a trace clip that removes the hair from the lower neck, shoulders and under the belly may be suitable for horses that are working lightly, but spend much of their time outdoors. A high trace clip removes more of the hair coat and is good for horses who are doing harder work.</p><p>Outdoors the horse will need to be blanketed. Blanket and hunter clips remove most of the long hair coat, except for under-the-saddle area and legs. A full clip removes all of the long hair coat from the entire body and legs. Horses with these clips will need a blanket while stabled and outdoors. Horses with full-body clips may need stable bandages on their legs during very cold weather. Clipping your horse requires a lot more maintenance, but may be worth the time if you must work the horse and cooling out and drying it takes a long time each time you ride.</p>",873
65,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-measure-a-horses-height-1887322,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>How to Measure a Horse's Height</h1>,"<h1>How to Measure a Horse's Height</h1><p>Chances are if you read ads selling horses, or someone is telling you about the height of their horse, they will use the word ""hands"" to express the measurement. For example, a very tall horse might be 17 HH. A pony is an equine under 14.2 HH. ""HH"" or ""H"" stands for ""hands high"" or ""hands.""</p><p>A hand is a measuring unit for an equine's height that has been used for several centuries. The measurement may, in fact, trace back to the ancient Egyptians. A hand represents four inches or approximately the width of a male adult's hand. However, horses are not exclusively measured in hands. In some countries and for FEI competition, horses are measured in centimeters. Ponies, miniature horses, and other diminutive equines may also be measured in centimeters or in inches rather than hands.</p><h2>Hands and Other Measurements </h2><p>Because one hand is equal to four inches, partial hands are expressed as decimals. A horse that is 14.2 hands is 14 hands plus 2 inches. The total inches would be 58 inches: (14 x 4) + 2. A horse could never be said to be 14.5 inches, as the number after the decimal is not a fraction, but represents an entire inch. If a horse is 14.2 1/2 HH, that means he's two and one-half inches over 14 hands.</p><p>Horses are measured from the ground, just beside and behind a foreleg to the top of the withers (shoulders). This is the one part of the horse's top line that does not change whether he lowers or raises his head or drops or arches his back. This is the standard location to measure the height of a horse, regardless of what increments (either hands or centimeters) you use, what country you are in, what discipline your ride, or what breed of horse or pony.</p><h2>Tools </h2><p>There are a few instruments that you can use to measure a horse's height. The most accurate and easiest method is to use an equine height measuring stick. This is a tall stick marked with inch measurements, with a horizontal bar that slides up and down the stick. The stick is held alongside the horse, and the horizontal bar is slid down until it touches the horse's withers. Some sticks have a leveling bubble, so you can be sure you are holding the stick level.</p><p>Height tapes can be purchased inexpensively at feed or tack stores. The problem with tapes is that they are light and floppy, and are hard to hold taut enough to get an accurate measure. Someone has to hold the bottom against the ground, while another person eyes up the measurement at the horse's withers. You can't lay the tape against the horse. It must stay perfectly perpendicular to the ground. Often height tapes are printed with a weight tape on the opposite side.</p><p>A regular tape measure can also be used to measure height but comes with the same problems as the height tape. Additionally, metal tape measures make rattling noises horses sometimes object to, making it difficult to get the horse to stand still for a measurement.</p><p>Probably the easiest homemade measuring device is a piece of binder twine tied to a large metal nut or washer. The weight of the metal will hold the string steady, while the handler eyes up the withers and marks the twinea magic marker will do the trick here. Then the length from the bottom of the washer to the mark on the twine is measured. Another trick is to use a yardstick, piece of lath, or even a whip to make it easier to get a line from the twine to the withers. Just hold the yardstick so it is sitting on the horse's withers, parallel to the ground, and note where it hits the tape.</p><h2>How to Measure </h2><p>To measure your horse, have it stand square on a level surface. Hold the tape or stick perpendicular to the ground and beside the horse, and even with the top point of the horse's withers. If you are using a proper measuring stick, lower the bar, so it meets the top of the horse's withers. Take note of the measurement. If you can only measure in inches, divide the inches by 4, and calculate the remaining inches. So, 62 inches would be 15 hands plus 2 inches or 15.2 HH.</p><p>If the height is the determining factor of whether your horse will compete in horse or pony events, you may have to take horseshoes into account. Shoes can easily put a ""pony"" over the official height, and you need to find out if allowances are made for shod ponies. If you require a horse of a specific height or need to qualify a horse's height, you'll need to know if the measurement includes shoes or not.</p>",800

Quite often they tell you, but you might mistake it for bad or odd behavior.</p><p>You may discipline your horse or put on a noseband to make it mind the bit. Or, you may change bits, put on martingales or tie downs, or use other gear designed to keep your horse'shead where it belongs. You may change feeds, buckets, or other aspects of your horse's environment. But,your horse could beacting up or doing strange things because it is experiencing discomfort and pain.</p><p>Ideally, your horse'steethshould be checked by a professional at least once a year.Learn the signs that tell you it's time to call an equine dentist or veterinarianto check your horse's teeth, even if it has been less than a year.</p><h2>Fussing With the Bit </h2><p>A horse that fusses with the bit may be reacting to discomfort caused solely by the bit, or as with head tossing, dental problems that make holding onto the bit uncomfortable. Sometimesextra teethcould be the problem, and your horse might need either a bit seat or to have teeth removed.</p><h2>Quidding or Spitting out Hay </h2><p>Quidding is when a horse spits out balls of hayit has already chewed. A horse that quids is not swallowing its food properly. This can cause the horse to lose conditioning, as its full nutritional needs are not being met.</p><h2>Head Tossing </h2><p>There are a few reasons your horse might toss its head while being ridden. It may be reacting to how you use the reins. It could have problems carrying the bit, or it may have dental problems that cause continuous discomfort, or just when it wears a bit.</p><h2>Weight Loss and Poor Overall Health </h2><p>If your horse cannot chew properly, it will not be able to extract all the nutrition it needs out of fibrous fodder,such as grassor hay. Bad teeth can contribute to weight loss. A horse that cannot chew properly is also prone to chokeand impaction colic.</p><h2>Slow Eating </h2><p>If your horse has broken teeth, infected gums, sore cheeks, or any other discomfort in its mouth caused by dental problems, it may chew its food very slowly. This can lead to weight loss and poor nutrition, especially if it is rushed in any way, say by other horses, that want to steal its food.</p><h2>Balkiness, Bolting, and Spooking </h2><p>Some horses have no tolerance for painand will act out by becoming resistant. Some will become spooky and are likely to bolt at the slightest distraction. Others will be quite stoic and will put up with a lot, which is why regular dental care is important.</p><h2>Spilling Grain </h2><p>A horse that eats by spilling or throwing grain may be anxious about its food. Also, it might be trying to keep an eyeout forany other horses that may try to steal its food. Or, the horse may just have a difficult time holding the grain in its mouth and chewing, because of dental problems. Because the grain might not be ground up (or chewed) properly, choking can result.</p><h2>Bad Odor </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>If there is a bad odor coming from your horse's mouth or nose, suspect an infection of the gums or elsewhere in the mouth. This might be the only sign of a potential problem that might require treatment with dental work and antibiotics.</p><h2>Drooling </h2><p>Horses may drool or slobber after having eaten plants with fungi or some other irritating substance. Also, something might be embedded in the gums or under the tongue, or the horse might have a dental problem. Some horses drool when they have a bit in, and that is pretty normal. But if you are not sure, it is probably best to call a vet or equine dentist.</p><h2>Sinus Discharge </h2><p>A small trickle of clear or slightly milky fluid is normal from your horse's nose. A yucky running nose can be a sign of not only a sinus infection, but of a dental infection. Your vet will help you find the cause of the discharge and advise you on the best treatment.</p><h2>Head Shy </h2><p>If your horse is head shy and will not let you touch, groom, or put the bridleon, then a painful dental problem could be the cause.</p><h2>Dehydration </h2><p>Horses with bad dental problems may be hesitant to drink cold water. A lack of water can lead to choke andimpaction colic, along with difficulty getting allthe necessary nutrition from the food.If you suspect a dental problem, it might be wise to wet your horse's feed and provide warmed water until a professional can help you sort out the problem.</p>",763
67,https://www.thesprucepets.com/facts-about-foals-1885777,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>10 Facts About Foals</h1>,"<h1>10 Facts About Foals</h1><p>Foaling season is an exciting time around any horse stable. Breeding stables often have many foals being born around the same time, and of course, horse owners are excited to greet a new addition to their four-legged families when beloved mares give birth.</p><h3>What is a baby foal?</h3><p>A baby horse is called a foal until it reaches 12 months of age. The term is also used to identify baby donkeys, but it's most common when referring to newborn and young horses.</p><p>If you've ever seen a newborn horse or come across videos of mares with their brand-new offspring, you've likely already noticed their distinct ability to stand up and walk shortly after birthbut there are plenty more interesting facts about foals that make them unique.</p><p>Here, find 10 facts about foals to discover more about these baby animals.</p><h2>Gestation Period of 11 Months </h2><p>It takes around 11 months for a foal to fully develop inside of the mare. Some foals can be a few weeks late or early. Occasionally, a foal can be up to four weeks late. Most breeders try to time foaling for early spring, so the foal can grow and exercise throughout the summer months.</p><h2>Foals Can Stand Within Two Hours of Birth </h2><p>Foals can stand, walk, and trot shortly after birth. Ideally, a foal should be up and nursing within two hours of birth. If the foal takes longer, it may be a good idea to call the veterinarian. Foals can gallop within 24 hours.</p><h2>Mare's Milk Provides Immunity Boost </h2><p>The first milk a foal gets from its mother is called colostrum. This milk boosts the foal's immune system, as it is born with little protection. Ideally, the foal should get colostrum within the first hours of birth or at least within 24 hours of birth. This not only provides antibodies, but colostrum helps the foal pass the first manure called the meconium. The foal needs about two liters of colostrum in the first 24 hours of life.</p><h2>Foals Lack an Immune System </h2><p>Because the foal is born without infection-fighting antibodies, an infection can set in very rapidly. The foal's umbilical stump must be disinfected for a few days after birth and watched for any signs of illness.</p><h2>Mares and Foals Engage in Silent Communication </h2><p>Mares and foals bond very quickly. Much of their communication is almost imperceptible to the human eye.</p><h2>Foals Might Have Bowed Legs </h2><p>Many foals are born with oddly bowed legs. This is referred to as ""windswept"" and one cause may be a relatively large foal born to a small mare. Because their ligaments and tendons are immature, they may also walk with their fetlocks almost touching the ground. Within a few days, as the foals become stronger, the legs should show signs of straightening up. If not, it's time to call the veterinarian.</p><h2>Most Foals Are Born at Night </h2><p>Foals are most often born at night, and birth often happens very quickly. It's not unusual for an owner to nap by the stall then run and grab a quick cup of coffee or take a bathroom break only to find a foal waiting for them when they return. In the wild, this nocturnal and rapid birth helps to protect a mare and foal from predators when they are at their most vulnerable.</p><h2>Foals Enjoy Grass Soon After Birth </h2><p>By the time foals are about 10 days old, they'll start to eat a bit of grass and hay. By two months, the foal will need more nutrition than mare's milk alone can provide.</p><h2>Foals' Legs Rarely Grow in Length </h2><p>A foal's legs are almost the length they will be when they reach adulthood. One way breeders determine the height a foal will ""finish"" at is to do a string test. There are two different ways to do this.</p><h2>Foals Can Wean at Three Months </h2><p>Foals can be weaned from four to nine months of age. However, if there is a concern about the condition of the mare, or the foal shows signs of too rapid growth, early weaning may be best. By four months, the foal no longer gets a substantial amount of nutrition from its mother's milk.</p><h2>A Long Time Between Foaling and Riding </h2><p>Although it will be years before a foal is mature enough to be ridden, it can start to learn good ground manners right away. It can be taught to be led quietly and to pick up its feet to be cleaned.</p>",750
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/introducing-a-new-horse-to-the-herd-1886162,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>How to Introduce a New Horse to the Herd</h1>,"<h1>How to Introduce a New Horse to the Herd</h1><p>Getting a new horse is very exciting, but adding a new horse to your herd (even if it's a small one of two or three) can result in a few tense moments and some worry on your part. Horses are herd animals and when several live together, they quickly develop a hierarchy with leaders and followers. Quite often, there will be one leader who may have a favorite sidekick and somefollowers. Horses figure this hierarchy out for themselves with little interference from their human owners.</p><p>Regardless of how you integrate the newcomer to the herd, you will probably want to keep the new horse separate (as a form of quarantine) until you're sure it's healthy and free of disease. If you don't normally keep halters on your horses when they're outside, this might be the one time you put breakaway halters on at least the herd leader and the newcomer, so they can be easily caught if necessary. Check the pastures and stalls for hazards that a horse might encounter, as it tries to get away. If the footing is very icy or muddy, hold off until conditions improve.</p><p>Chances are, if you just have one or two horses, they'll welcome the newcomer very quickly. There will be some posturing, prancing, tails up, sniffing, and squealing, but because horses like being in herds, and they'll probably settle in very quickly.</p><p>Turning the horse out in pastures or a paddock alone may help it to learn the lay of the land and familiarize itself with the smells left behind by the other horses.</p><h2>Just Put Them Together </h2><p>There are a few schools of thought about introducing a new member to a larger herd. Many people simply put the new horse in with the others and let them sort things out for themselves. Quite often this works, and occasionally it does not. It usually works best with horses that are known to be followers and not herd leaders. Some horses, often the newcomers, will end up with bite marks or get kicked in any scuffles that may transpire.</p><p>As long as everyone has lots of room to get out of the way, the herd usually settles in with a minimum of fuss and the new member takes its ""assigned"" position in the herd pecking order without question. If the newcomer is very assertive and feels it should become the new leader, it may take time for everyone to settle into the new order.</p><p>It's important to keep a watchful eye, to separate the new herd member if necessary, before a horse gets hurt. There is the occasional mix that just doesn't work and some horsesoften those who are quite dominantcan't live with new herd mates safely.</p><h2>Mix Gently </h2><p>Some horse owners choose to introduce a new member to the herd gradually. This includes keeping the horse within view, but not within touching distance of the existing herd. After they've had a chance to smell and see each otherfrom afar, they can be moved closer together in neighboring paddocks. This can be tricky, as putting them together can mean they decide to strike out at each other, bite, or kick through the fence. Again, a watchful eye is required to make sure that any scuffles don't result in injury. The duration for which they are exposed to each other can be increased slowly until they are quiet and used to each other.</p><p>After everyone gets used to one another, separated by a fence, the horses can be put together. Just because the horses were right next to each other and had plenty of time to sniff noses doesn't mean there won't be any squealing, biting, kicking, or galloping around when the new horse is put in with the others, but chances are, the initial excitement will wear off a bit quicker and the herd will settle into its new structure.</p><h2>Add One and Then Another </h2><p>Another way to introduce a new herd member is to turn the newcomer out with the others, one at a time, and add in more. This gives the horse time to bond with one or two members at a time, with the leader added in last of all.</p><p>You'll know your horse has been fully accepted into the herd when they all graze together and the bickering has stopped. There's always a small risk of one horse injuring another, even well after the introductions are over. The chasing and other excited behaviors should end as the new horse becomes an accepted member of the herd.</p>",758
69,https://www.thesprucepets.com/tying-your-horse-or-pony-safely-1885956,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>Tying Your Horse or Pony Safely</h1>,"<h1>Tying Your Horse or Pony Safely</h1><p>Whenever you are grooming or saddling, you will need to tie your horse. Horses and ponies can be tied with a lead rope, trailer ties, or cross ties. No matter what is used, tying must be done in a manner that is safest for handler and horse.</p><p>There is some debate about whether horses should or shouldn't be tied ""solid."" Tying solid means to tie so that it's almost impossible for the horse to break free. For the horse's or pony's sake, it is probably best if handlers don't tie solid. If a horse is badly startled while tied it could panic, struggle, and injure its neck and back. The goal should be to teach your horse not to be tiedbut to stand. A horse that is taught to stand won't challenge the ropes it is tied with.</p><p>Sometimes, you have to balance horse safety against people's safety. There may be situations where it is safer to tie solid than have a badly frightened horse break away and bolt into a crowd of people or busy highway. When we are working with our horses in a paddock or the stable, it's safer for the horse to be tied so the rope or tie will break free if it panics.</p><p>Ideally, the rope should be attached chest height or higher. The rope should be tied so it doesn't dangle low enough to be stepped over but not be so high or so tight that the horse's head is restricted.</p><p>Never tie to a bridle, with the reins, or to the bit in any way. If the horse struggles, it could severely injure its mouth.</p><p>Always tie to a post, wall, or partition that is firmly anchored and will not come loose if the horse pulls on it. The object is to have the tie rope break rather than the structure you are tying to or the horse's neck. Don't tie your horse or pony to anything that moves. If you are at a horse show or trail ride, be cautious when tying to fences. Old posts can be weak at the bottom and may be ripped up by your horse.</p><h2>Cross Ties </h2><p>In a barn with roomy workspaces or aisles, cross ties secure your horse and make it easy to work all the way around when grooming, or tacking up. Cross ties should be long enough for the horse to lower its head comfortably, but not so long that it would be possible for the horse to become entangled or even step over the rope.</p><p>Cross ties can be made to break free easily by attaching the ends through loops of bailer twine or strong string. A half-inch garment elastic can be used if you like the idea of a tie that flexes when the horse pulls on it a bit, but will still break if the horse struggles. Chains are not a great idea for cross ties. If a panicking horse breaks free with chains attached, the chains can swing and cause injury to both horse and handler.</p><h2>Trailer Ties </h2><p>Trailer ties work well if you are tying in or to a trailer/post. Make sure your trailer ties are long enough so that your horse's head is not too restricted. Some ties are made 18"" long, and not long enough for use while you are working with your horse; your horse won't be able to move his head naturally. Longer, adjustable trailer ties (about 3 feet long) with quick-release snaps are ideal. Make sure the snaps aren't stiff with rust or winter ice so in an emergency they work the way they are supposed to.</p><h2>Lead Ropes </h2><p>A cotton rope 1-1.5 inches in diameter is ideal for lead ropes. Flat lead shanks of leather or webbing aren't ideal for tying with. Again, loops of bailer twine, string, or garment elastic make safe breakaway ties around a fence post. Tie high enough that the horse cannot step over the rope, but not so high or tight as to restrict the movement of the horse's head. Check your ropes often for wear if you need to tie solid, such as out on the trail or at a horse show. Use a quick-release knotso that if your horse is struggling, you can easily pull on the end of the rope and free the horse.</p>",717
70,https://www.thesprucepets.com/winter-horse-and-pony-care-tips-1887259,Horses > Horse Ownership Basics > Horse Care,<h1>14 Winter Care Tips for Horses and Ponies</h1>,"<h1>14 Winter Care Tips for Horses and Ponies</h1><p>Winter can be hard on horses and horse owners. Feeding can be a challenge and the snow and cold can make some horses lose condition. Stable care can become more difficult and riding almost impossible depending on snow depth and temperature. Here are tips for making life easier for you and your horse during the frigid winter months.</p><h2>Adjust Feeding Programs </h2><p>Even in areas not affected by snow cover, grass often stops growing and the nutritional quality may decrease. As pasture quality or accessibility declines consider increasing hay and concentrates. That way, your horsewon't lose weight during the winter or lack important nutrition.</p><h2>Supply Water </h2><p>You won't want to give your horse warm water, but studies have shown that horses offered water that isn't frigid will encourage them to drink. Impaction colicincreases during the winter because horses aren't drinking enough and there is little moisture in hay compared to grass. They also won't be able to digest hay and get the most of its nutrition if they aren't hydrated well, even in the cold.</p><h2>Help Horses Keep Warm </h2><p>Horses kept outside need to eat more fodder. Horses produce a lot of heat during digestion. A generous supply of hay helps keep the horse's internal furnace stoked, helping to keep them warm in cold weather.</p><h2>Add Minerals </h2><p>If your feeding program does not include a mineral supplement consider adding one. Test your hayso you know exactly what minerals and concentrates you need to add to your horse's diet.</p><h2>Have Teeth Checked </h2><p>Make sure your horse's or pony's teeth are looked after by an equine dentist. The inability to grind food properly will prevent a horse from getting all of the nutrients and energy it needs--especially if energy needs increase during colder weather.</p><h2>Prevent Snowballs </h2><p>If snow packs into your horse's hooves try smearing the bottom with petroleum jelly. Talk to your farrier to discuss adding ice calks and snow padsto your horse's shoes and don't skip farrier's visits just because it's winter and you're not riding as much.</p><h2>If You Ride Frequently </h2><p>Drying a horse out after a workout is difficult. Consider clipping a heavy hair coat. A clipped horse, without natural insulation, will require stabling and blanketing to keep warm. Don't put a horse out in the cold wet with sweat. Allow extra time for a horse to dry out before turning it out after a ride.</p><h2>Add Insulation </h2><p>Consider blanketing during wet, very windy, or frigid weather. A wet coat loses its loftlike a wet down jacket, and won't hold body heat. Windy weather pulls warmth away. Some horses are comfortable during very cold weather; some will be more comfortable in a warm winter blanket.</p><h2>Provide Shelter </h2><p>Even if your horses are stabled overnight, provide them with a windbreak or a run-in shelter, especially if you are away most of the day.</p><h2>Banish Bots </h2><p>Plan to deworm after the first heavy frost. Botflies attack in late summer, so in late fallor early winter, use a wormer that includes medication to kill bot larvae.</p><h2>Continue Deworming </h2><p>Continue a regular deworming program throughout the winter months.</p><h2>Don't Let Hooves Get Overgrown </h2><p>Keep your horse's hooves clipped. Properly trimmed hooves will chip less, hold less snow, and will provide a bit more grip on the slippery ground. Hard ground and ice can cause serious cracking to overgrown hooves and your horse' s grip on slippery surfaces won't be good if the hooves are too long.</p><h2>Check Under Blankets </h2><p>If your horse or pony wears a winter blanket (or rug) during the winter remove it daily and check for chaffing and irritation. Daily grooming keeps coats cleaner and your horse more comfortable if he wears a blanket. If it's rubbing or chaffing, try a different blanket or have the blanket altered. A bib made to go beneath the blanket can help stop rubbing.</p><h2>Make Cleaning Frozen Water Buckets Easier </h2><p>Rubber buckets are easier to knock the ice out of if they become frozen than plastic ones. Plastic buckets used for water can shatter when they freeze. This can create a hazard and waste money when replacing them. Rubber buckets may cost more initially but last longer.</p>",686

There are blankets for cooling horses outand ones for warming them up. Some have therapeutic properties, while others keep dust off the horse's coat. Some people believe a horse should never be blanketed, while others have a complete wardrobe of rain sheets, turn out rugs, summer and winter stable blankets, and coolers.</p><p>If you feel your horse needs a blanket, you'll need to determine just what type you need. A turn-out rug isn't suitable if your horse is working hard and sweating and a rain sheet in cold weather may keep your horse cold. Choosing carefully is important. Here's a rundown of the various types of blankets available.</p><h2>Stable Blankets </h2><p>Stable blankets or night blankets as they're sometimes called are designed to be worn when the horse is kept in a stall. They can be insulated for warmth, or made of a lightweight fabric to keep the horse's coat clean. They are of a much lighter fabric than turnout blankets because they aren't expected to get the same wear and tear that a turnout blanket does. They may or may not have leg straps to prevent shifting.</p><h2>Turn-Out Rugs </h2><p>Turn-out rugs or blankets are made of durable, waterproof but breathable fabric, lined with quilting for warmth. They have sturdy belly, chest and leg straps. Many rugs are designed to sit high up on the neck and often have pleats and gussets at the shoulder and haunch to allow ease of movement. It's important to choose a turnout blanket that breathes because a horse can sweat under a completely vapor-proof blanket.</p><h2>Coolers </h2><p>Coolers and anti-sweat sheets come in different designs. They may be fitted like a stable blanket, or they may simply be a large square of fabric with a few ties on either side. Coolers are meant to absorb sweatwhile preventing the horse from becoming chilled from any breezes that may be blowing.</p><p>Square coolers are draped over the horse as its standing, and these tend to slide off easily if the horse moves around too much. Fitted coolers may have standard straps and fastenings so they can be left on a horse in a stall safely. All will be made of fabric that is breathable and wicks away moisture. Summer coolers may be made of a mesh or thin fabric and less warm then ones intended for cold weather use.</p><h2>Rain Sheets </h2><p>A rain sheet is made of waterproof fabric and may be lined with a thin cotton-like lining. The purpose of the rain sheet is to keep the horse dry in wet weather. It's very important to buy a rain sheet made of breathable fabric. In warm weather, horses can quickly become overheated and sweat in a rain sheet. The horse can then become chilled, and the humid environment beneath the blanket might cause skin irritations. Use non-breathable fabric rain sheets only for very short periods of time, such as between classes at a horse show.</p><p>Putting a rain sheet on in cold weather may not be a good idea. While it will block the wind, it will also mat down the hair, preventing the piloerection of the coat that keeps a horse naturally warm, without having any insulating properties of its own.</p><h2>Fly Sheets </h2><p>Fly sheets can be simple mesh blankets that look like a cooler made of gauzy fabric, or they may be more form-fitting, with gussets, leg and belly coverings. The purpose of these blankets is to keep biting insects off of your horse. Many offer UV protection to prevent the horse's coat from getting bleached and dry.</p><p>Fly sheets that are very open weave may not be effective, and you will see horses kick and swish at flies with as much vigor as the horses standing next to them not wearing blankets. Horses wearing a fly sheet in the hot sun may be warmer than those that are not. So use your discretion about when and where your horse wears a fly sheet. Fly sheets need to be sturdy and well fitted. They tend to rip and shift easily.</p><h2>Therapeutic Blankets </h2><p>Therapeutic blankets can be made of special nano-fabrics that are purported to warm and soothe muscles, have magnets attached to them, or other technology that is supposed to heal and relax your horse. These blankets can be very costly. Follow the manufacturer's directions for use and care for the best results.</p><h2>Under Rugs </h2><p>These are insulating blankets that can be worn under a stable or turn out rug as a liner for extra warmth. Traditionally, they were made of wool (in colorful plaid designs), but now they can be quilted or fleece fabrics. They may have belly and chest straps, or they may only have fasteners to attach it to the outer blanket.</p><h2>Half Sheets, Quarter Sheets and Rump Rugs </h2><p>Half sheets, quarter sheets, and rump rugs are meant to be used while the horse is being ridden. They keep the horse's large muscles warm and covered during cold weather. If your horse wears a winter turnout rug, a rump rug is a good idea to prevent chills as you warm up to ride. There are several different designs, some meant for high visibility.</p><p>Some only cover the horse's haunches, some cover the horse from the shoulders back, with the saddle sitting on top of it, or some will cover the horse from chest to haunches, and the rider. Be careful with the style that covers horse and rider. If the horse isn't used to wearing one, it can cause big problems. If the rider falls off,there is a potential for the blanket to become entangled sothe rider can't fall free of the horse. Rump rugs and a quarter or half sheets may be covered in the wind and waterproof fabrics, wool or quilted fabrics.</p>",971
72,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-snaffle-bits-work-1886099,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How Snaffle Bits Work</h1>,"<h1>How Snaffle Bits Work</h1><p>Whether you ride English or Western, it's likely that you started out by riding your own horses or by being mounted on a schoolmaster horse while using a snaffle bit. These bits sit comfortably in the horse's mouth in the rear opening between its top and bottom teeth, and can be used with rubber lip guards to prevent pinching its lips.</p><h3>What is a Snaffle Bit?</h3><p>A snaffle bit is a common type of horse bit that is gentle on the horse's mouth. Comprised of either a single bar or two to three jointed pieces between large rings on either side, snaffle bits make it easy for riders to communicate with their horse and are commonly used to train young horses and beginner riders.</p><p>Even if you don't start out using a snaffle bit, there's a good chance that somewhere along the path of your riding education, you will ride with one. Knowing how the snaffle bit works is helpful in developing effective rein aids and to avoid being either ineffectual or too hard on your horse's mouth.</p><p>Although the basic action of most snaffle bits is the same, it sometimes takes trying a few different bits to find one your horse is comfortable with. Sometimes choosing the right bit, even if you are choosing among snaffles, can take a bit of time.</p><h2>Snaffle Basics </h2><p>A snaffle bit has a straight or jointed mouthpiece with rings on each end of the mouthpiece. There are many different types of snaffle bits. The basic structure is the same for all, and the basic action in the horse's mouth is similar, with some subtle modifications. The snaffle bit is regarded as a relatively mild bit. The addition of wire wrapping or other similar mouthpiece variations can make it much harsher.</p><h2>What Happens When You 'Pull' the Reins </h2><p>When the reins are pulled, a pressure is applied to the area of the gums that have no teeth called the bars of the mouth. This gap is between the front teeth that crop grass, and the back teeth, that grind the food. A properly fitting bit sits comfortably within this gap, just forward of the grinding teeth. Occasionally, a horse will have problems carrying a bit comfortably and small teeth called wolf teeth may have to be pulled, or a bit seat created.</p><h2>How the Horse Reacts to the Signals </h2><p>The simple snaffle applies pressure to the bars of the horse's mouth. There is no pressure anywhere else on the horse's head and no leverage comes into play as it does with a curb bit. When you pull straight back, the horse will understand that equal pressure on both sides of its mouth means to stop. A pull to the right, that applies pressure on the right bar, means turn to the right and a pull to the left, of course, means turn left.</p><p>As you learn to refine your rein aids, combining them with using your seat and leg aids, you will learn to cue your horse for things like leg yields, half-passes, lead changes, changes of gait and other more advanced riding skills. While at first you may be simply 'pulling' the reins, you will in a short time learn to give much more subtle signals that can be felt by the horse but are almost imperceptible to the average observer.</p><h2>The Function of Bit Rings </h2><p>The rings on a snaffle may be D shaped or have a small piece sticking up or down like a full cheek snaffle and Fulmer snaffle. The rings may slide or they may be fixed to the mouthpiece. The shafts perpendicular to the mouthpiece on the full cheek and driving bits prevent the bit from slipping through the horse's mouth. Large leather or rubber type discs can be used to keep the bit from chaffing the sides of the horse's mouth as well. The rings can affect the weight of the bit and prevent the bit from pulling sideways through the horse's mouth.</p><h2>How Mouthpieces Differ </h2><p>Bits with jointed mouthpieces will have a nutcracker effect, while straight mouthpieces spread the pressure evenly over tongue and bars. An egg butt snaffle will have oval rings, and the mouthpiece will get thicker as it approaches the rings. These bits are among the mildest because they distribute the pressure of the rein aid over a wider area of the bars. Generally the thicker the mouthpiece the milder the bit. A horse with a large tongue or low palate might be uncomfortable in a bit with a thick mouthpiece.</p><p>The French link is considered the mildest jointed snaffle. The Dr. Bristol link, although it looks similar, is much more severe, because of the way the plate in the middle of the bit lays in constant contact with the tongueeither flat or on an angle, depending on how the rider attaches the bit to the bridle.</p><h2>Variety </h2><p>Snaffles can be hollow to reduce weight, flexible, twisted, joined with one or more links, have keys or rollers, be squared or oval, or have any combination of shapes and joints. Mullen mouth bits are the same width from end to end. Wire bits are quite thin and wire wrapped bits add to the sharpness of the pressure on the bars of the mouth.</p><p>All of these variations are intended to enhance the rein aids. Different metals and material can be used to encourage the horse to accept the bit for its taste or encourage salivation. Copper, sweet iron, vulcanite, and other synthetics can be used. Some bits, often used for teaching a young horse to hold the bit, are flavored.</p><h2>The Vesatility of Snaffle Bits </h2><p>Snaffles are often the first bit a horse will carry. Many will be ridden throughout their entire lives with a snaffle bit.</p>",952
73,https://www.thesprucepets.com/the-basics-of-horse-trailers-1886949,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Horse Trailer Types and Basics</h1>,"<h1>Horse Trailer Types and Basics</h1><p>Horse trailers come in many styles and sizes. If you only have one or two horses, then you're unlikely to need more than a two-horse trailer. A smaller truck and trailer combination is a bit easier to learn about hauling with too.</p><p>When shopping for your first horse trailer, you'll need an idea of what is available and what you need your trailer for so you can match a trailer with your needs. Here are the basic facts about horse trailers and their materials and design.</p><h2>Bumper Pulls or Tag Alongs </h2><p>Bumper pull or tag along trailers attach to your truck via a hitch affixed to your truck's frame, that comes underneath the rear bumper. Bumper pull trailers can haul up to four horses depending on the trailer and truck size.These trailers are sensitive to the push of the wind, the movement of the horse and may tend to sway. They are a little harder to back up than a gooseneck. They're called bumper pulls, but they aren't attached to your bumper.</p><h2>Goosenecks </h2><p>0</p><p>Gooseneck trailers are heavier than tag-alongs and may need a larger truck with a truck bed hitch to haul. They are easier to handle than a bumper pull, and you might not notice the movement of your horse or wind. Because they are heavier, you'll end up using more fuel, but if you're often hauling more than two horses, a gooseneck might be your best choice.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>Height and width are important when you are looking at horse trailers. Your horse should be able to stand with its head at normal height and not have to skooch down when being hauled. Larger horses need wider trailers. Trailers come in pony-to-draft horse size so choose according to the size of horses you'll be hauling. Too much space, especially head-height space, is better than too little.</p><h2>Stock Trailers </h2><p>Stock trailers are essentially open boxes with no partitions or stalls between the occupants. In a stock trailer, you can tie the horse on an angle or frontwards. Some stock trailers, depending on the size, have a gate so that there are two box stall areas. Many horses that don't like to ride in a horse trailer will be more willing to ride in a stock trailer because they are brighter and more open. When considering a stock trailer, be sure it's high enough for horses, as many are made for cattle and have a low roof.</p><h2>Straight Loads </h2><p>Straight load trailers haul horses with their heads forward and their tails to the rear of the trailer. A few types of straight loads haul the horse with their heads backward. This may be easier on the horse because they can use their haunches to brace when you are braking and accelerating. You mustn't put a horse backwardin a regular straight load trailer. Straight-load trailers hold two or more horses.</p><h2>Slants </h2><p>0</p><p>Slants give you more space for storage and living quarters and you can fit more horses on a smaller trailer, depending on how the stalls are designed. There are two types of slant load trailers. In both, the horses stand at a 45-degree angle to the road, but in a reverse slant load, the horses are facing more backward. Some horses may be more comfortable in this arrangement because they can use their stronger haunch muscles to brace when you put on the brakes. For long-distance hauling, this may be less tiring for the horse. On the downside, it's harder to get to a horse in the front stall of some slants, should the need arise.</p><h2>Ramps </h2><p>Trailers may have a ramp for loading horses. A ramp may seem like a good idea, and many trailers are made with them, but they may not be ideal. A ramp gives a hesitant horse more time to think about getting onto a trailer. You have to bend and lift to put the ramp into place, putting you in the way of a horse's heels. And, ramps can be heavy to lift. Horses that are sticky about loading may be less hesitant to hop onto a step-up entranceand there's no heavy door/ramp to fall or kick down.</p><h2>Step Ups </h2><p>Some trailers require the horse to step up to load. This is often easier than encouraging a horse to walk up a hollow-sounding ramp that may feel like it's flexing underfoot. Step-ups might encourage a horse to rush as it hops up, however, so it's important to teach your horse to load quietly no matter what type of entry the trailer has.</p><h2>Steel </h2><p>Steel trailers are common. They tend to be heavier than aluminum or fiberglass combinations, but they are sturdy and in an accident offer some protection. To prevent rust, they should be well maintained and stored in a dry place.</p><h2>Aluminum </h2><p>Aluminumis light and bright, but if it needs repair, fixes can be expensive and tricky.</p><h2>Tack Areas and Living Quarters </h2><p>Some trailers have areas to store your gear. This is very handy if you're showing or trail riding off your yard. Living quarters or ""LQs"" allow you to travel with your horse long distances, overnight at horse shows, or camp on the trail. Many trailers with living quarters offer the same comforts as a regular camping trailer.</p>",867
74,https://www.thesprucepets.com/different-types-of-bit-mouth-pieces-1886101,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>15 Horse Bit Mouthpieces Every Equestrian Should Know</h1>,"<h1>15 Horse Bit Mouthpieces Every Equestrian Should Know</h1><p>Just like the various materials bits are made of, horse bits come in many mouthpiece styles. Choosing the right bit for your horse can take some trial and error. Some factors to consider include the size and shape of your horse's mouth, how your horse has been trained, and what your riding skill level is. Ultimately, you should pick the mildest bit that still allows for clear communication with the horse.</p><h2>Mullen Mouth </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>A mullen mouth is a plain mouthpiece with a slight curve over the horse's tongue. This makes it more comfortable for the horse to carry than a straight-bar mouthpiece. It's also considered more gentle than a jointed mouthpiece, as there is no pinching effect when the reins are pulled.</p><h2>Single Joint </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>The single joint lets a rider exert targeted pressure on each side of a horse's mouth, offering better control of the horse. However, single joints can create a so-called nutcracker effect that pinches the horse's tongue and bars (the space in a horse's mouth between the incisors and molars). Even so, for some horses, this variety might be more comfortable than a straight-bar mouthpiece.</p><h2>French Link </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>A French link is a double-jointed mouthpiece with a small plate in the middle. The two joints help to soften the nutcracker effect, but they still give the rider control on each side of the mouth. Some horses might prefer the rounder version of the French link known as the lozenge or oval mouth.</p><h2>Dr. Bristol </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>Also called a Doc Bristol, this double-jointed mouthpiece has a flat link in the middle and looks similar to a French link. The difference is its link is longer and set at a slight angle, so the edge of the link puts more pressure on the tongue. Like the French link, the Dr. Bristol only has a slight nutcracker action.</p><h2>Ball Link </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>Also similar to the French link, the ball link of this mouthpiece sits directly on the horse's tongue and exerts pressure. This bit is slightly more severe than a French link, but it's gentler than a Dr. Bristol because there's no edge on the link to press into the tongue.</p><h2>Twisted Mouthpiece </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>Twisted bits can be made from a combination of materials and may have a straight, mullen, or jointed mouthpiece. The twist is meant to apply strong pressure in the horse's mouth, placing the mouthpiece among the most severe varieties. A slow twist, or one with fewer turns, is less severe than a fast twist with more turns. Some equestrians use twisted bits for horses that don't respond to rounded ones.</p><h2>Rollers </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>Rollers are usually made of stainless steel, copper, or both. The small, rotating pieces of metal encourage the horse to play a little with the mouthpiece, ideally relaxing its tongue and jaw. This can lead to the horse's acceptance of the bit. But the rollers do slightly increase the severity of the bit, and some designs might cause pinching.</p><h2>Keys </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>Keys are small, elongated metal beads most often seen on mouthpieces used to introduce young horses to the bit. There are usually three keys attached to a center ring on the mouthpiece. You might see this called a mouthing bit, and many trainers no longer favor it because it sometimes encourages the horse to play too much with the bit.</p><h2>Ports </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>Ports have a raised areatypically the shape of an inverted ""U""in the middle of the mouthpiece, which reduces pressure on the tongue. This prevents the horse from using its tongue to soften the bit's effect. There are low ports that only have a slight rise, as well as high ports that put some pressure on the horse's palate. Some ports also include rollers or keys. Both English and Western bits can have ports.</p><h2>Quarter or Half Moon Link </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>The quarter or half moon is another type of link for a mouthpiece. The moon provides room for the tongue, while the double joint softens the nutcracker action compared to a single joint.</p><h2>Thick or Thin Bit </h2><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>In general, the thicker the bit, the softer the effect in the horse's mouth. But some horses with a low palate or large tongue might find thick bits uncomfortable. A thinner mouthpiece is generally more severe, as it concentrates all the pressure on one narrow area in the horse's mouth.</p><h2>Hollow Mouthpiece </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>A hollow mouthpiece is a lighter weight than the same bit made with a solid material. Many horses carry this bit comfortably because of its weight.</p><h2>Wire Bit </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>Wire mouthpieces can be straight, jointed, or twisted, and they're very severe. Their thin nature, along with any twists, greatly concentrates the pressure in the horse's mouth. Consequently, many people feel wire mouthpieces are cruel.</p><h2>Chain Mouthpiece </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>Chain mouthpieces use either link or bicycle chain. These bits are very severe, and their use is generally frowned upon.</p><h2>Spade Bit </h2><p>PriceGrabber</p><p>The spade bit is rooted in vaquero tradition, and horses only carry this highly technical mouthpiece after extensive schooling. The spade comes in contact with the horse's palate when the reins are pulled, and the pressure can be quite great. In inexperienced hands, this can damage a horse's mouth. It is not a bit for training horses or correcting habits, such as pulling or head tossing.</p>",871
75,https://www.thesprucepets.com/should-you-choose-leather-or-synthetic-tack-1886248,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Should You Choose Leather or Synthetic Tack?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Choose Leather or Synthetic Tack?</h1><h2>Tips For Choosing Between Leather or Synthetic Tack</h2><p>Walking into a tack store can be an overwhelming experience. There are so many choices. This can be good because you can choose exactly the equipment that's right for you and your horse. But, too many choices can leave you wondering if you made the right decisions and if you've made a mistake when you leave with your purchase.</p><p>The two major pieces of tack you'll be choosing when you get your first horse are the saddle and bridle. These also represent the largest outlay of money and the most important gear in terms of safety. Chances are, you want to get the most for the leastthe safest, longest-lasting, most effective and most comfortable for the least amount of dollars.</p><p>As you look around, you'll probably notice that tack is made of either synthetic or leather. Bridles come in many materials, and you'll likely have lots of color options. Saddles too can be made of synthetic or leather, and you might even find some that are colors other than the traditional browns, grays or blacks.</p><h2>Costs </h2><p>Generally speaking, leather tack costs more than synthetic. Poorer quality leathers will cost around the same as synthetic items. Tack made of cardboardy, stiff leather should be avoided. These items won't last as long as good quality leather and they may be more prone to breakage. If cost is a major factor in your decision, you may be better off with good quality synthetic tack, than poorer quality leather. Good leather tack is an investment, that will hold its value better if you decide to resell it. Buying used is an affordable way to buy good quality leather bridles and saddles.</p><h2>Identifying Leather Quality </h2><p>Poor quality leathers will feel stiff and cold. The edges may be different colored than the surface because the surface dye and/or tanning don't go all the way through.This is sometimes masked by tinting the edges to match the surface after the pieces used to construct the saddle are cut. The underside may be fibrous looking. The surface may be stamped with a 'skin texture' and the leather may be more chemical-smelling than leathery. Cheap dyes can seep out of the leather and discolor your riding pants after a rain.</p><p>Good quality saddle leather will be smooth and supple, There may be the odd tiny imperfection. This is visible because the surface has not been sanded down and refinished. This means the leather will actually be stronger, and will not discolor badly over time. Saddlers generally work around these imperfections in whole hides used to make saddles, but small scars, nicks, and other naturally occurring marks may still appear even though they strive to use top quality, blemish-free vegetable-dyed leather. There is no need to dye or paint the edges on good leather, because the finish goes through, although there may be a final finish put over the whole saddle, because the leather used may come from different hides, and even different types of leathers may be used. Billet straps made of top quality leather will not feel as elastic as cheaper leathers. Good quality leather reins will feel supple in your hand, and not plastic or cardboard-like, as poorly tanned leather is.</p><p>Buying a saddle made by a well-known manufacturer of quality goods is the easiest way to avoid cheap leather that will break and discolor over time.Visit a saddler, or examine carefully the higher end saddles and bridles tacks shops sometimes carry to educate yourself further.</p><h2>Fittings </h2><p>It's hard to see the tree of the saddle, but it is easy to check the metal fittings. Good saddles will not have light steel or nickel-plated rings and buckles. On western saddles, the fleece should be real sheepskin that is thick and even. Girth straps on western saddles should be thick and strong, without much give. Rigging and rivets should be made of good quality metals that won't rust. And, and decoration on western saddles should be minimal and made of good quality materials.</p><h2>Longevity </h2><p>A good quality leather saddle will last a lifetime with the proper care. That's not always a goal, especially with a horse we know we won't be keeping for a long time. Leather English saddles can be re-stuffed and refitted to fit many different horses, but there is a limit to how much a saddle can be altered. So if your first horse is an Arabian, and your next is a Clyde cross, you may need a different saddle. Yes, the resale value on a good leather saddle is better than a synthetic. But, if low cost alone is an important factor, you may be better off with synthetic for short term use. A good quality leather bridle will fit many different horses, and is a good investment over the long term, although making the Arabian to Clydesdale transition may still send you looking for a bigger bridle.</p><h2>Fit </h2><p>Leather English saddles are much easier to re-stuff and fit to different horses. There are limitations, however, so a leather saddle will not fit every horse that comes along. Synthetics are harder to fit and as the materials break down, the saddle may lose some of its shape.</p>",879
76,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-clean-your-leather-saddle-1886276,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How to Clean Your Leather Saddle</h1>,"<h1>How to Clean Your Leather Saddle</h1><p>Many older horse books state that you should clean our saddles every time you use them. However, that may not be practical. How often you clean your saddle may depend on how it is used. If you only use your saddles on weekends for leisurely pleasure rides, you might not need to clean your saddle as frequently as someone who participates in a sport where the saddle is exposed to sweat, mud, and dirt regularly such as distance riding or cross-country jumping.</p><p>If you keep your saddle uncovered in a dusty stable or ride in a dusty arena, you may want to clean your saddleso that grit doesn't ruin the finish and dry the leather out. To protect your saddle, use a saddle cover of breathable material and wipe it with a dry cloth after every use. Or a quick wipe with a soft, damp cloth may be all a saddle needs.</p><p>But, it makes sense to clean them well before storing, before a competition, or before selling one. (And if your stored saddle has sprouted mold, don't worry. Just follow the steps below.)</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3>Strip the Saddle </h3><p>Strip the saddle of all fittings such as the girth or stirrups and undo any buckles.Taking off all the fittings allows you to get into the nooks and crannies, where dirt gathers, more easily. Wipe the saddle down with slightly dampened toweling to remove any loose dust, dirt, and hair. Don't ever get your leather too wet, because this in itself can dry it out.</p><h3>Choose Saddle Soap </h3><p>Dampen the sponge in the water. You'll want it damp, but not dripping wet. Dip it in the saddle soap and work up a lather.</p><p>If it's the first time you've cleaned your saddle, try any leather cleaner, especially all-in-one cleaners on an inconspicuous spot on your saddle. Choose all-in-ones carefully because some all-in-one cleaners that promise to clean and condition in one step may not be good for leather. Some contain detergents that over time can damage the leather. Some can discolor your leather, so be sure you can live with the color change. Most will darken the leather, and this is to be expected. But if your leather has a colored finish, you don't want that removed.</p><h3>Clean the Leather </h3><p>Apply the lather to the leather. Work in small circles covering all surfaces of the saddle; top, underside, and between flaps. On an English saddle, be sure not to over-wet the underside, as this cansoak the wool flocking under the leather, causing it to compact. Frequently rinse and re-lather the sponge. Do not apply soap or water to suede or throughout leathers often found on seats or knee rolls. Give these a rough-up with a stiff brushjust enough to loosen the dirt. You don't want to wear through these softer leathers.</p><p>In areas where the jockey is built upthat thicker, black layer of dirt that tends to build under the stirrup leathersrepeat the soaping a few times without wetting the leather too much. Pay special attention to where sweat has soaked through the leather.</p><p>Brush the underside of a western saddle lightly with a stiff brush.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Did you know you can have this fleecy layer replaced if it gets too worn and dirty?</p><h3>Clean off Any Residual Soap </h3><p>Wipe the saddle with a damp towel and then a dry towel. You'll want to remove any residual soap from the leather as soap left behind may damage the leather over time. Some saddlers recommend using only a damp cloth and no soap.</p><p>Residual soap left in crevices and folds will also hold grit that can eat away at the leather. Use dampened cotton swabs or the corner of a towel to get all soap out of tiny stitching channels and crevices.</p><p>Wipe the saddle dry. The next step is conditioning, and most conditioners work best on leathers that are a tad damp.</p><h3>Apply Leather Conditioner </h3><p>Beeswax and other thick conditioners can leave a residue, so be prepared with toweling and elbow grease to buff this away.</p><h3>Clean Metal Fittings and Stirrup Leathers </h3><p>Wipe down all metal fittings such as stirrups and buckles, and remove any residual soap or conditioner that may have gathered on them. Use an old toothbrush or cotton swabs to clear out any small areas where soap or conditioner are caked.</p><p>Follow the same steps of applying soap and conditioner to clean the stirrup leathers. This is a good time to check their condition and ensure they're still safe. A metal cleaner can be used on stirrups, but they can also be cleaned with regular dish soap and water. Rinse well. Be careful if you clean the metal fittings on the saddle with the metal cleaner that the cleaner doesn't get into the leather. Try placing a corner of a towel between the leather and the metal, to protect it. Vinegar works well on metal fittings, too.</p><h3>Brush up Suede or Rough-Out Leathers </h3><p>Very occasionally you may want to make suede or throughout seats or knee rolls look nice. Use a stiff bristle brush to brush up the nap. Do this very infrequently. Too much brushing will wear through the suede, and you'll end up holes. You may want to do this step only if you're trying to make the saddle look extra good for a special show or to sell.</p>",883
77,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-saddle-a-horse-1886278,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How to Saddle a Horse</h1>,"<h1>How to Saddle a Horse</h1><p>Whether you ride an English or Western saddle, the basics of saddling up are the same. The goal is safety and comfort for the horse and rider. These instructions feature an English saddle in the images, but they apply for both styles of saddle. You might notice a slight difference between the two saddle types when strapping on the saddle.</p><h2>Brush Your Horse </h2><p>Brush your horse's back and girth area. Be careful to remove any dirt or grit that may cause chaffing under the saddle or girth. Brush so all the hair lies flat. Check the girth area as well, and brush or sponge away any dirt or mud. If you leave grit on your horse's back or girth/cinch area, this can lead to painful gallsor irritations that can make your horse misbehave.</p><p>It is traditional to saddle from the near side (left side), but you should be able to saddle from the right (offside) if necessary.</p><h2>Position the Blanket or Pad </h2><p>If you are using a Western saddle blanket, it is generally folded in half. The fold should go to the front when the blanket is on the horse. Or, you may use a Western saddle pad, which does not require folding.</p><p>An English saddle pad may be shaped to fit neatly under the saddle and may have ties or hook and loop fastener tabs attached to a D-ring on the saddle. It helps keep it in place while riding. These tabs or ties go on the top side, not against the horse.</p><p>Place the saddle pad or blanket on the horse's back, positioning it forward over the withers and sliding it back into place. This positioning ensures that the hair on the horse's back lies flat beneath the pad and saddle. Make sure the blanket or pad is even on both sides. Check both sides to ensure that the pad or blanket is not folded, wrinkled, or curling.</p><h2>Lift the Saddle On </h2><p>The stirrups on an English saddle should be run up the leathers, and the offside stirrup of a Western saddle should be hooked over the horn or folded over the seat. These precautions prevent the hard stirrup from hitting you or the horse as you lift the saddle. The girth buckle or cinch (if you have them) should be folded back over the saddle seat. Some people take their English girth off the saddle completely each time they finish riding. Removing these items helps prevent the billet straps from being twisted when the saddle is stored. If you remove the girth after each ride, you will have to buckle up both sides when you saddle up.</p><p>Lift the saddle high enough, so it doesn't hit the horse or knock the pad out of position. The saddle should be placed slightly forward and settled back. Place the saddle gently on the horse's back. If you let a saddle fall heavily onto your horse's back, it may spook the horse or cause the horse to resent being saddled or ""cold backed.""</p><h2>Check Both Sides of the Saddle </h2><p>Move to the offside to take the stirrup down on a Western saddle and check the pad or blanket, so there are no wrinkles beneath the saddle on both sides. If the girth or cinch is not already attached to the offside, buckle or tie it. Check again that the blanket or pad is flat and that the horse's hair beneath the pad stays smooth and lies in the natural direction it grows. Wrinkles in a blanket or pad can cause galls or cause discomfort that could make your horse irritable.</p><h2>Get Ready to Buckle or Cinch </h2><p>Move to the near side, reach beneath the horse, and pick up the free end of the girth or cinch.</p><h2>Connect the Girth Buckles or Cinch Straps </h2><p>Either buckle the girth or tie the cinch up loosely. Tighten the girth or cinch gently in small increments. If you girth up a horse suddenly and tightly, it can cause a horse to kick or bite. The horse may begin to resent being girthed up and can become ""girthy."" Some horses may bloat themselves in anticipation of discomfort. Ask the horse to step forward, wait a moment for it to exhale, and tighten the girth gently again.</p><p>Only tighten the girth enough to hold the saddle firmly in place. Some riders feel the tighter the girth, the more secure they will be. You should not need to make the link sausage out of your horse by over-tightening the girththis can lead to injury and may compromise your horse's breathing. You should be able to slide your fingers between the girth or cinch and the horse's body.</p><p>If there are tabs at the front of your saddle pad, loop them through the D-rings at the front of the saddle and tie or fasten them.</p><h3>Remove Wrinkles and Help the Saddle Settle </h3><p>Check that there are no wrinkles in the skin under the girth. Stand at your horse's head facing back. Pick up one front leg by holding the pastern or low on the canon and stretch it forward. Do this for both front legs.</p><p>As a horse works, you may find the girth becomes looser. Always check its girth before mounting and again after a few minutes of riding.</p>",872
78,https://www.thesprucepets.com/protective-leg-boots-for-horses-1886294,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Protective Leg Boots for Horses</h1>,"<h1>Protective Leg Boots for Horses</h1><p>You may see a horse on a televised competition wearing leg protection and wonder precisely what it is for, or if your own horse needs this type of protection. Although they are called 'boots,' they don't serve the same purpose as 'hoof boots.' Leg boots help protect the delicate structures of the leg from bumps against obstacles, or the horse's own hooves. They also help support the tendons and ligaments in the legs, as performance horses can be prone to straining these tissues. Horses have no padding from muscle tissue in the lower leg, so boots can help prevent potentially debilitating injuries.</p><p>Unless there is a pre-existing condition that needs protection, most backyard pleasure horses do not need any leg protection. However, some horses, no matter how light their workload is, are prone to over-reaching, forging, or interfering and injuring themselves. Often poor conformation causes them to hit themselves, especially after they get tired  like how a person might trip over their own feet when fatigued. Young horses that are being started may hit themselves because they are unbalanced. And of course, performance horses  hunters, jumping, endurance horses, barrel race, reiners, and many others  may benefit from the support and protection of a leg boot.</p><p>Depending on what your horse's specific problem is, or what sport you're competing in, there are many boots to choose from. Manufacturers don't always use the same name to describe all boots. Some boots combine functions, such as a boot that is both a sports medicine boot and skid boot.</p><p>It's vital that leg protection fits well, is kept clean, and frequently checked in case the boots are chaffing. Built-up sweat, grit, and dust can make boots uncomfortable, so cleaning them regularly is essential. Here are the most commonly used leg protection or leg boots.</p><h2>Bell Boots </h2><p>These boots encircle the pastern, and the bell shape covers the entire hoof. They can be made of rubber, heavy synthetic material or leather lined with fleece. Bell boots are worn in the stall or paddock, or while ridden. In either case, they prevent the horse from hitting itself, especially where the terrain may be rough or muddy, and where a horse is negotiating obstacles like jumps, provide some protection from hitting a hard surface. Bell boots can be worn on the front or back.</p><h2>Fetlock Ring </h2><p>Amazon</p><p>A simple rubber donut, called a fetlock ring, can be used for turnout or riding to prevent the horse from injuring its hind fetlocks. This ring stretches over the hoof and sits on the lower fetlock, although you may need strong hands to do this.</p><h2>Leg Wraps </h2><p>Before there were all kinds of specialized leg boots, leg wraps were used. Polo wraps are the most common type used for riding, and standing bandages are used in the stable.</p><h2>Brush, Brushing, Splint Boots </h2><p>Amazon</p><h2>Shin Boots </h2><p>Shin boots are most commonly used by jumpers to prevent injury to the front of the leg when hitting a jump rail.</p><h2>Ankle and Fetlock Boots </h2><p>Amazon</p><p>Fetlock boots are for protection when a horse hits itself. They cover the pastern joint and fetlock areas of the lower legs. They are not meant to provide support. They are usually made of leather or synthetic materials and lined with sheepskin or other soft material.</p><h2>Open Front Boots </h2><p>Amazon</p><p>Many of the boots come in open front styles; this is because sometimes, the rider may want a horse to feel when it is hitting a jump. Some horses become complacent and scrub over the rails of jumps. The open front boot may encourage the horse to be a little more 'honest' about tucking up its knees and clearing the obstacle, while still providing some protection. They also allow more airflow around the lower leg.</p><h2>Knee Boots </h2><p>It's a bit tricky to keep boots or bandages around a horse's knees, but sometimes knee protection is needed. Barrel racers and reiners are sometimes seen with knee boots. These boots aren't really supportive, but provide extra padding to horses if they may bump their knees against something, such as hitting a barrel in a barrel race.</p><h2>Skid Boots </h2><p>Amazon</p><p>Skid boots protect the hind fetlocks and pasterns, providing support along with protection from contact with the riding surface during fast stops and turns. You'll see these boots most commonly on reiners who do sliding stops and cutting horses. Although, English riders such as jumpers might find they need them. They will be made of leather and fleece or synthetic material that provides cushioning. Closures are most often buckles or hook and loop fastener.</p><h2>Sports Medicine Boots </h2><p>Amazon</p><p>Sports boots provide both protection and support. They cover the lower leg, front or back from the pastern to below the knee. They are not as padded as splint boots but provide more support to the tendons and ligaments. You'll most often see them on endurance horses, jumpers and other horses that must negotiate tough terrain. They can be made from synthetic materials or leather. Some materials are designed to retain heat, which is felt to increase blood flow to the leg. Others are made to be cool.</p>",844
79,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-an-english-girth-for-your-horse-1886288,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How to Choose the Right English Girth for Your Horse</h1>,"<h1>How to Choose the Right English Girth for Your Horse</h1><p>An English girth comes in many different shapes, materials, and lengths. If you're standing in front of a large display, you can easily be left scratching your head trying to pick the one that is right for you and your horse. Here are some tips to help you make the best choice.</p><p>There are two fundamental styles of English girths to choose from, and these are designed to accommodate the length of the billet straps on your saddle. If you have a dressage saddle, you'll likely have very long billet straps that extend beyond the bottom of the flaps. This is, so the girth buckles don't end up under your leg and interfere with your leg aids. The girth you'll need for this type of saddle is very short.</p><p>If you have a forward seat, all purpose, close contact or almost any other variation of an English saddle, the billet straps are much shorter and likely don't extend beyond the bottom of the flaps. For these types of saddles, you'll probably need a much longer girth. This will allow the girth to reach the short billet straps on these types of saddles.</p><p>Both types of girths will have rings or D-rings positioned on them, and whether you need these or not will depend on the other tack you put on your horsesuch as martingales or over-girths.</p><p>Whether you need a dressage or regular length girth for your saddle, you'll find they come in a variety of materials as well. Deciding on the material your girth is made from is a matter of preference. Functional quality leather girths are the most expensive, and with proper care can last a very long time. You'll also find girths made of cotton or synthetic string, neoprene, webbing and felt, and other high tech materials. These have their pros and cons.</p><p>English girths may also have strong elastic that attaches the buckles to the girth on oneor both ends. This elastic tends to wear out over time (it is replaceable on good quality girths), but can be more comfortable for the horse.</p><p>Unfortunately, there's no way to find out if you have the right girth for your horse until you try it out. You might find synthetic girths cause galls.Some may hold heat or irritate some horse's skin, but most are comfortable and easy to clean.Or you might find leather girths not quite right, and a string girth works the best. Or, you might discover quite the opposite. It takes a bit of trial and error to find the right one.</p><h2>Synthetic Girths </h2><p>Synthetic girths can come in materials that are constructed similarly to leather girths but tend to be less expensive and easily cared for. They may not last as long as a good quality leather girth, but if you need several different girths to accommodate different horses, a selection of synthetic girths in your tack room may be the way to go. You may also find synthetic girths lined with synthetic fleece, gel, or with sheepskin.</p><h2>Atherstone Girths </h2><p>Also called 'chaffless,' these girths are shaped so that the width behind the horse's elbow is narrower. The Balding is one piece of leather that has been cut into three strands, with the two outer strands crisscrossed almost like a braid. The Atherstone is a leather girth that is shaped similarly, but is all one piece, or may have a single strap to which a thicker, shaped and padded length of leather is sewn. Shaped girths may have elastic ends.</p><h2>Leather Girths </h2><p>Arnuchulo/Pixabay</p><p>Leather girths are often one width of leather folded over three times so that the cut edge of the leather isn't against the horse's skin. The exposed cut edge is the outside of the girth. There may be an elastic or webbing insert inside the girth, or the girth may be entirely of heavy leather. Shown is a leather dressage girth.</p><h2>Jumping Girths </h2><p>Jumping girths have large oval panels in the center that prevent the horse from hitting its belly with its forefeet when jumping. They are also called belly guard girths. There are trail riders who use these girths because they feel it distributes the pressure over a wider area than a regular girth. Some consider them overkill and think that they might hold heat as well. They're also the priciest girths, simply because of the materials and construction.</p><h2>String Girths </h2><p>String girths are made of lengths of multiple strings and maybe cotton, mohair, wool or nylon. They are cool because they dry quickly and allow air flow. While they maybe comfortable for some horses, others may be pinched and chaffed by the stringsleaving painful girth galls. However, these girths don't slip as easily as other types of girths, and for some horses, they may be just the thing. All can be washed easily, although only synthetic string girths can be washed in a washing machine. Just don't bleach a nylon girthit will be permanently yellowed. Nylon string girths tend to get quite 'brittle' feeling with use. The girth pictured here is a brown mohair girth.</p>",842
80,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choose-the-right-floor-for-your-horse-stable-1886938,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Choose the Right Floor for Your Horse Stable</h1>,"<h1>Choose the Right Floor for Your Horse Stable</h1><p>When building or renovating a barn for horses, what they will be standing on is a veryimportant consideration. Horses that are kept inside need to stand still on whatever is on their stall floor for long periods of time, which can be hard on their legs. For this reason, from a leg health perspective, flooring needs to be chosen carefully.</p><p>Maintenance is another factor. The upkeep of some types of flooring is easier than others. You may wish to have one type of flooring for aisles, and another in thestalls. The type of floor you will choose for a new barn will depend on the existing natural soil, what materials are available to you, and your budget. Here's a look at the types of flooring found in the horse's stables.</p><h2>Soil, Sand, or Clay </h2><p>0</p><p>Leaving the existing soil in place is inexpensive and a healthy option for your horse, but your floors may require daily upkeep to keep them level and the soil may have to be replaced in time.</p><p>Clay-based soils will also need a lot of maintenance inhorse stalls. Damp clay can be slippery or sticky and horses can dig holes and hollows depending on where they most often stand, paw, or walk around. It's possible to install clay floors, and it's recommended that these be laid over a thick layer of crushed gravel and kept clean and dry.</p><p>Sand is frequently used for stall floors. It is easy on the horse's legs, non-slip, and requires minimal bedding material over top. It drains well and is replaceable once it becomes very soiled. Sand-bedded stalls may need ""topping up"" as sand is taken away each time the stall is mucked out. Sand colic is a concern if horses eat off of the floor. Sand floors also become uneven easily if the horse paces or paws in its stall. It may also be drying to hooves.</p><h2>Wood </h2><p>Wood was once the standard flooring material in horse stables. Wood floors are easier on a horse's legs than many other choices. It's warm, non-slip when dry, and has relatively low upkeep. Treated wood is required to prevent rot from urine and water spills, and to dissuade rodents and bugs from chewing through it. The wood planks should be at least two inches thick and sit atop a base of sand or gravel for drainage.</p><p>Any spaces between planks need to be filled with sand so that feed and bedding don't spill through. The downside of wood floors is that they can be slippery when wet, they can hold odor, can be damaged by pawing horses, and can be hard to disinfect. The cost of plank flooring is one factor that makes this a less popular option than it once was.</p><h2>Concrete </h2><p>Concrete flooring is very common in stables. It is very durable and easy to clean and is hard to damage. It can be slippery, so while very smooth finished concrete may be attractive and easy to sweep in feed and tack rooms, textured concrete is better for stalls and aisles.</p><p>If horses are kept in for long periods of time, it will be healthier for their legs if rubber stall mats are laid over the concrete, or at very least, the stall is bedded deeply. It also tends to be cold and damp, so some horses may be reluctant to lie down in their stalls.</p><h2>Crushed Limestone </h2><p>Sometimes called limestone dust, this material, if installed properly, can be a comfortable, safe stall flooring. It must be well packed and level when it is put in. The benefit of crushed limestone is that it provides good drainage if properly installed with several inches over a bed of sand. It's also a non-slip surface. However, limestone can pack to an almost concrete-like hardness, which means stall mats and/or deep bedding will be needed to provide comfortable footing for your horse.</p><h2>Interlocking Brick </h2><p>Interlocking brick or pavers are attractive but present the same problems as concrete floors. Because of the grooves between the pavers, they can be a bit harder to clean. Rubber and synthetic bricks are other options, and these are easy on a horse's legs, provide good drainage, and are non-slip. This is probably the most expensive option for stall and aisle flooring.</p><h2>Grid Floors </h2><p>Several types of grid floors are available for stalls. These honeycomb-patterned grids are laid over a few inches of sand or crushed gravel and then filled with crushed gravel or stone dust to make a floor that drains well.</p><h2>Asphalt </h2><p>Asphalt is a bit easier on a horse's legs than concrete and can be made so it drains relatively well. When first laid, asphalt is non-slip but may become slicker over time. It needs to be laid thick enough that it does not crack. It's easy to clean, although disinfecting the porous surface may be difficult. Asphalt may be one of the less-expensive options for stall floors and aisles.</p>",824
81,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-clean-a-horse-stall-1886001,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How to Clean a Horse Stall</h1>,"<h1>How to Clean a Horse Stall</h1><p>If your horse lives in a stall for any part of his day, you'll have to keep it clean. This is more than just keeping things pleasant for you and your horse. Unclean stalls attract insects and can encourage hoof problems such as thrush. Breathing ammonia from urine-saturated bedding can be harmful to your horse's or pony's sensitive lungs. And a dirty stall is unpleasant to work in and smelly for you, too.</p><p>Stall cleaning should be a daily task. It usually takes no more than 20 minutes to give a stalla quick cleaning, but will take longer if you have neglected the duty for more than one day.</p><h2>Tools and Materials You Will Need: </h2><h2>How to Clean a Horse Stall </h2><p>Follow this process to effectively clean your horse's stall. Once you're in the routine, it can be done easily in 15 to 20 minutes as part of your daily routine.</p><h3>Dress for the Job </h3><p>Dress in appropriate clothing for this admittedly messy job. Gloves can prevent blisters. Urine can erode the stitching on the soles of leather riding boots, so save yourself boot-cleaning time by changing into work boots or rubber boots.</p><h3>Prepare the Stall </h3><p>Take your horse out of the stall during cleaning. A good time to muck out is when your horse is in the pasture grazing or exercising. If you can't put him out, put your horse in an empty stall. Next, remove all the feed tubs, water buckets, and toys from thestall before beginning your cleaning routine.</p><p>Assemble your cleaning tools and park your wheelbarrow or cart close to the stall door, facing in the direction you will wheel it toward the manure pile. It's easier to maneuver an empty wheelbarrow than a full one.</p><h3>Dig in With Fork and Shovel </h3><p>If the stall is bedded with straw, use a pitchfork to remove manure and wet or soiled bedding. If shavings or sawdust have been used, use the shavings fork to remove manure and wet bedding. Fork the manure and soiled bedding into the wheelbarrow or cart. Sometimes it's easier to pick up wet bedding with a shovel.</p><p>As you fill the wheelbarrow, wheel it out and dump out the contents in the assigned area (the manure pile). It's tempting to fill the wheelbarrow really high, but this can make it hard to push and easy to tip. It's frustrating having to clean up manure a second time because you've tipped over the wheelbarrow, so making two or three light trips is the better strategy.</p><p>As you continue cleaning out the dirty bedding, scrape the unsoiled bedding to one side and check to make sure there is no wet or manure-soiled bedding hiding underneath.</p><h3>Occasional Deep Cleaning </h3><p>You may want to completely strip a stall occasionally. In this case, keep filling your wheelbarrow until the stall floor is completely bare. Use the shovel to scrape up remnants of bedding and the broom to sweep it clean. You may want to put down odor-control solution or stable disinfectant. Let the floor dry before re-bedding.</p><h3>Spread Out Clean Bedding </h3><p>Once you've removed all the manure and soiled, wet bedding, spread whatever clean bedding that remains back over the stall floor. Check around the edges of the stall, as clean bedding sometimes gets tossed against the walls as the horse moves around. This leaves a thinner area in the middle, or wherever the horse usually stands. Distribute the bedding evenly.</p><p>Add fresh new bedding to replace any you have removed. If using straw, either add a whole bale of straw or portions of one. Fluff the bedding with a pitchfork. If your stable uses shavings or sawdust, use a wheelbarrow to transport fresh shavings to the stall, or open a bag and fluff the compacted shavings with the shavings fork. Some stables have truckloads of loose shavings piled, or you can buy bags of compacted shavings.</p><p>The thickness of your bedding will depend on what type ofstall flooring is under the bedding and what season it is. If there is thick rubber matting on the stall floors, bedding can be thinner. On bare concrete, add more bedding to provide padding and urine absorption; this is especially important during cold weather. Sand floors are easier on your horse's legs but may get saturated with urine quickly if you don't put enough bedding down.</p><h3>Clean the Alleys and Doorways </h3><p>After you've finished cleaning and bedding the stall, use a broom to sweep up any spilled manure, straw, or shavings in the alleys and doorways to the stable. Scoop up the sweepings into the shovel and toss them into the manure pile. Left unattended, manure, chaff, and bedding in doorways will turn into a muddy mess in wet weather.</p><h3>Finishing Up </h3><p>Put all the tools away where they won't cause a tripping hazard. Return the feed tubs, buckets, and toys so the stall will be ready for your horse.</p>",811
82,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-an-english-saddle-pad-1887240,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Choosing an English Saddle Pad or Numnah</h1>,"<h1>Choosing an English Saddle Pad or Numnah</h1><h2>Types of English Saddle Pad</h2><p>English saddle pads come in many different materials, shapes, and design. Some are traditional white, while others come in wild colors and patterns. Here's how to choose the right pad for you and your horse.</p><p>There are a few basic shapes of pads to choose from. A full pad is almost square. A shaped pad is roughly the same shape as the saddle. A half pad fits only under the upper part of the saddle, where the saddle contacts the horse's back. There are also pads that help solve minor saddle fit problems. Saddle pads are not intended to correct major saddle fit problems.</p><p>Traditionally, English saddles were used without a pad or 'numnah '. Early saddle pads or blankets were only used to keep the saddle clean, protecting it from sweat and dirt. Now saddle pads are designed to reduce shock, prevent heat build-up, and in the show ring, are an important part of correct turn-out.</p><h2>Another Name for a Saddle Pad is ""Numnah"" </h2><p>The word numnah isn't commonly used in North America, although it is a word somePony Clubmembers may see on their tests. A numnah is a pad of sheepskin or wool that goes under the saddle to keep thesaddle cleanand to cushion the horse's or pony's back. In NorthAmerica,we call a numnah a saddle pad or blanket. The word numnah is more familiar to horse riders in the U.K. is a word likegymkhanathat was brought back to the U.K. from India.</p><h2>Full, Square or Dressage Pads</h2><p>Full pads come in a variety of designs. They can be a simple square of quilted fabric or may have rounded or 'swallow tailed' corners for a tailored look. Better quality pads may be thickly quilted or may have a gel or foam center. Full pads are made of a wide variety of materials, from quilted faux suede or cotton to neoprene and other synthetics. Full pads may be contoured to accommodate horses with dropped backs or high withers.</p><p>Most will have leather or synthetic loops to put the girth straps through to prevent slipping. Some may have neoprene or other 'sticky' textile that helps hold the pad in place. Sometimes called dressage pads, white is the correct color to use in dressage shows. Schooling pads come in many fun colors and patterns. The space behind the rider's leg can be embroidered with a logo.</p><p>Because full pads cover a bit more of the horse than other pads, they're not a great choice where the prime consideration is coolness. If you're planning on showing dressage, you'll definitely need a schooling pad in addition to the one you take to shows, because a white pad becomes soiled very quickly.</p><h2>Shaped Pad</h2><p>Shaped pads are perhaps the most traditional English saddle pads. The shape of the pad roughly follows the shape of the saddle. Like full pads, they can be made of a wide variety of materials. When you're shopping for a pad, you'll need to keep the type of saddle you have in mind.</p><p>For example, a shaped pad made for an all-purpose saddle will not fit well under a dressage saddle. In just about every English riding discipline, except dressage, it is acceptable to use a shaped pad. For a show, you'll probably need white, or a color that matches your clothing. This will depend upon the show rules. You'll want about one to two inches to show around the outside of your saddle.</p><p>Shaped pads are prone to slipping and bunching, and most will come with loops to attach to either the D-ring on the front of the saddle or to the billet straps. Neoprene or other high-tack material can help prevent slipping. Sometimes, it's almost impossible to prevent a pad from slipping and if that's the case, you'll need to try another pad or consider there may be more serious saddle fit problems.</p><h2>Half Pads</h2><p>Half pads have become popular over the last few years. These pads only cover a small portion of the horse's back under the saddle tree. They can be made of either synthetic or natural fleece, which is visible at the front and back, or they may be made of a quilted or thick synthetic material, with rolls of fleece at the front or back. They may have gel or foam centers for shock absorbency. Half pads can be used alone, or put on top of a thin shaped pad. Half pads are most often seen in the hunter-jumper show ring. Half pads can be prone to slipping. Some may be too thick and bouncy.</p><h2>Riser Pads </h2><p>Riser pads are usually made of synthetic foam-like material and are intended to balance the saddle, reduce shock and even out the pressure. There are front risers and risers that lift the back of the saddle.</p><p>While riser pads and other pads that reduce pressure on the horse's back can help solve minor saddle fitting problems, they cannot make up for a saddle that does not fit the horse.</p>",827
83,https://www.thesprucepets.com/designing-stable-for-emergency-safety-3577538,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Designing Your Stable for Fire and Emergency Safety</h1>,"<h1>Designing Your Stable for Fire and Emergency Safety</h1><h2>Reduce the chance of fire and make your stable more accessible in an emergency</h2><p>Stables, typically wooden structures full of hay and straw, are at threat for fire. However, there are ways to make your stable more fire safe. Whether you are in the planning stages of construction or are looking for some ways to make your current structure safer, here are some things you can do to make it less likely to burn quickly, easier to access in an emergency, and safer for both horses and humans.</p><h2>Wiring </h2><p>Barn wiring is subject to rodent chews, temperature fluctuations, dampness, and other wear. Wiring needs to be heavy enough to handle water heaters and other appliances without overheating. Any fixtures such as lighting, water heating or warming appliances need to be made for stable use. All outlets should be GFCIs. Any heating or drying equipment must be properly ventilated.</p><h2>Fire Alarms </h2><p>The type of fire or smoke alarm you have in your house will not be suitable for your stable. Install smoke and fire alarms that will withstand the temperaturechanges and dust common in stables. Some higher end smoke alarms come equipped to send an alert direct to your phone if the detector goes off, that way you can have peace of mind when you're not actually in the barn.</p><h2>Overhead Sprinkler Systems and Fire Extinguishers </h2><p>Overhead sprinkler or misting systems can be expensive, and they can be tricky to maintain, especially when the water supply is not consistent, or water is subject to freezing. But, they are a very effective way of controlling fires in stables. When sensors in the system are triggered by high temperatures, the system will spray the area, quelling the flames.</p><p>Fire extinguishers, however, should be in every barn. They are small and relatively inexpensive. If you have a large barn, consider placing an extinguisher at each end for ease of access. Make sure the extinguisher is well-marked and easily seen. The ABCclass of multipurpose extinguisher are most recommended for within a barn because of the varied materials that can burn in stables.</p><h2>Emergency Access and Containment </h2><p>When deciding where to put your stable on your property, consider how emergency vehicles such as tanker and pumper trucks will access the buildings in an emergency. Lanes need to be wide enough with few sharp corners for turning and the ground needs to be reasonably safe to drive on, ideally paved or gravel. Water access needs to be considered as well, as tanker trucks can quickly drain when putting out a large fire.</p><h2>Lofts </h2><p>A barn with a loft may look quaint, but that loft full of hay can be a fire hazard. When hay is packed damp, it can slowly molder and heat up. If the temperature gets high enough, fire can result. With a fire burning overhead, rescuing horses and contents beneath is extremely dangerous due to the threat of ceiling collapse. Hay is safest stored in another structure well away from your horse's stable.</p><h2>Ventilation </h2><p>The smoke of a fire can be as deadly as the flames and heat. Good ventilation can actually slow a fire, allowing fumes and heat to escape. As your stable is designed, consider the type of roof vents that can be installed to improve airflow.</p><h2>Structure </h2><p>Caving roofs and falling walls are a danger in a fire. The heavier and more fireproof the material you build your barn from, the better. Consider metal construction over wood, and if you do use wood, use heavy uprights and beams that are less likely to burn. Before installing solar panels on your roof, consider how they might contribute to the danger during a fire, both in terms of toxic materials and weight. Ground-mounted panels may be a better choice depending on your layout and the number of panels.</p><h2>Stall Doors </h2><p>Ideally, all stalls should open to the outdoors. All stall doors, whether they open to an inside alley, or to an outdoor paddock should be easily opened. Sticky doors can waste precious moments in an emergency.</p><h2>Outside Doors </h2><p>While this might not be such an issue with smaller barns, larger barns often have few doors that open to the outside. And, except for the main door that horses are brought through, any extra doors may be human doors, too small to easily lead a horse through. Ideally, there should be a wide door easily accessible from each stall and any areas used by humans such as tack rooms and viewing areas. Exits should be clearly marked and all pathways clear for safety.</p>",780
84,https://www.thesprucepets.com/description-action-and-uses-of-a-kimberwick-1886260,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>The Mechanics and Use of a Kimberwick Bit</h1>,"<h1>The Mechanics and Use of a Kimberwick Bit</h1><p>K. Blocksdorf</p><p>A Kimberwick, or as it's called in some places, a Kimblewick, is a common bit used in English riding and driving. It's often seen on ponieswith young riders who might struggle to control a ponyin a simple snaffle bit.Because of its leverage action, it's not used in some Pony Clubevents and dressage, but because it can provide a bit more ""whoa,"" many people like it for trail riding for the additional control it can exert on a horsethat might be a little more strong outside of the ring or arena. Of course, the severity of any bit often has more to do with how it is used than how much leverage or other action it has. Its use is sometimes controversial, as with any bit that is more severe due to leverage.</p><h2>Different Names </h2><p>Both the names Kimberwick and Kimblewick refer to the same bit, but the Uxeter type of either is a variation, with a slightly different action when the reins are pulled. The bit is named after the town, Kimblewick in Britain, where it first was introduced. You might not be able to show your horse in this bit, so check the show rules before arriving.</p><h2>Appearance </h2><p>The mouthpiece of the Kimberwick terminates at the top of ""D""-shaped rings, with the rings of the Uxeter Kimberwick having slots in them. Kimberwicks can haveastraight, jointed, or even a twisted mouthpiecewith or without a port. There is a small ring to attach the curb strap or chain. A Kimblewick should always be used with a curb strap or chain to prevent the bit rotating back too far in the horse's mouth. The mouthpiece may be of copper, synthetic, or other metal and it can be jointed or solid.</p><h2>Mechanism </h2><p>As mentioned above, the Kimberwick is a curb, or leverage, bit. The further the reins slide down the D ring, the more leverage is applied. On the Uxeter Kimblewick, the reins can be attached through the slots to keep them from sliding. If the reins are placed in the lower slot, the bit will have more curb action than the upper slot. If the rider holds their hands a bit higher, the reins will stay high on the rings of bits with no slots in the rings. Lowering the hands will cause the reins to slide down the ring, and cause more curb action.</p><p>With either type of Kimberwick, the curb chain or strap prevents the bit from rotating too far in the horse's mouth. When the reins are pulled back, the bit applies pressure to the bars of the mouth, the chin, and the poll. If there is a port, there may be pressure on the roof of the mouth. Because the bit has the equivalent of very short shanks, the curb action is relatively mild.</p><p>Ideally, every horse should be ridden in a plain snaffle bit. But, this doesn't always happen due to rider skill, the horse's training and behavior, or personal preference. A kimberwick may be a bit to try before trying something with even stronger leverage action like a pelham or other curb bit.</p><h2>Usage </h2><p>TheUxeter Kimberwickgives the rider the option to increase or decrease the amount of leverage the bit will provide when the reins are pulled because there is a choice of two positions to attach the reins to. Compared to a Liverpool bit, used in driving, this bit will have less leverage, as the 'shank' is quite a bit shorter. Many people don't recognize it as a curb or leverage bit, because the rings don't look like the shanks on a curb bit.With a plain Kimberwick, the action is more like a simple snaffle, as long as the horse or ponydoes not pull, and the rider's hands are light. If the horse does resist the reinaid, the leverage action comes into play.</p><p>This is a bit commonly used in general riding and provides more curb action to a horse that may be a strong puller or needs slight curb action to lower its head. It can not be used in dressage and many hunter classes, although you may see it on field hunters. For trail riding, it may be useful or in any situation where a curb bit might be handy, but the shanks of a traditional curb bit might get caught up in things. It is occasionally used for driving. It is quite common to see ponies wearing these bits. This is a bit commonly used in general riding and provides more control on a horse that may be a strong puller or needs slight curb action to lower its head. It's a popular choice for young riders on ponies who might not be very responsive to the rein aids.</p>",788
85,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-a-western-saddle-pad-or-blanket-1886304,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How to Choose a Western Saddle Pad or Blanket</h1>,"<h1>How to Choose a Western Saddle Pad or Blanket</h1><p>The saddle pad or blanket provides a bit of extra cushioning between the saddle and the horse and helps the saddle stay clean. Without a pad or blanket, a saddle will sit directly on the horse, where it will absorb sweat and pick up dirt from the horse's back. Cleaning the dirt or sweat out of a saddle pad or blanket will be much easier than cleaning the fleece on the underside of a western saddle.</p><p>No pad is a substitute for a properly fitted saddle. If you and your horse are consistently having a sore back or galling issues, you probably need to try different saddles rather than try to correct the problem with a different pad or blanket. Only very minor saddle fit issues can be compensated for with a pad.</p><p>Western saddle pads and blankets come in a wide variety of fabrics, shapes, and colors. There are even pony sizes. Here's a look at what's available and how to choose the right one for you.</p><h2>Western Saddle Blankets </h2><p>The most basic western saddle blanket is a simple long piece of thickly woven fabricfolded in half. These traditional saddle pads come in many colorful patterns and may have fringed or tasseled edges. You can have fun choosing one that compliments your horse's color. These blankets work well with many horses and saddles and could be all you need. They are easy to clean. Most can be tossed in the washing machine and dryer, or hung to dry.</p><p>The downside to these blankets is that on some horses, they may slide out from under the saddle. They can also bunch, which can cause sores. Because they are made of a woven fabric, they may catch burrs and seed heads. If you are riding in western pleasure classes, you might want to avoid a blanket with long fringes as this extra motion while your horse moves can give the impression of choppy gaits.</p><h2>Western Saddle Pads </h2><p>A slight variation on the traditional western blanket is a woven pad. These pads look like a woven blanket already folded. There may be padding between the top and bottom layers that absorb shock and leather straps that help hold the pad in place. These pads may also be shaped, so they fit the contours of the horse's back better for less slippage and bunching.</p><p>Some pads may have either natural or synthetic fleece on the underside. Leather edging helps prevent wear. If the center is made of foam, it may be quite hot on your horse's back, so you may want to look for one that features a breathable type of foam or wool.</p><p>Pads, because of their thickness, may be hard to wash. Some care has to be taken to be sure that the padding in the center does not become hard over time. Natural fleece may not last as long as synthetic, and both are prone to compacting and developing hard spots. Closed-cell foam center may hold heat, while the open-cell foam is cooler, but not as durable and shock absorbing.</p><h2>Felt Western Saddle Pads </h2><p>Felt pads are not quite as popular as they used to be. Pads of felted wool have been used for centuries under saddles and packs.Made of compressed wool, these pads absorb sweat welland dissipate heat.These pads come in square and shaped designs or contoured designs for abetter fit. For a horse with high withers or a dropped back, a contoured pad may be the best choice. They may feature leather reinforcement at wear points.</p><h2>Neoprene Western Saddle Pads </h2><p>0</p><p>Neoprene pads are popular for their shock-absorbing quality. The weave of these pads is thought to keep the horse's back cooler, and they are very easy to clean, usually requiring only a quick rinsing with a hose. In addition to the neoprene, these pads can have a gel, wool, or foam center. They may be contoured and have a cut-away to prevent the pad binding against the horse's withers. Some will be rounded at the back to better fit a short backed horse such as an Arabian or compact quarter horse.</p><p>Some pads will be designed to compensate for slight saddle fit problems or to provide more wither or spine clearance. Extra padding may be built into the pad, or the design may include pockets for inserts. Because the neoprene is sticky, it is less likely to slip or bunch. These pads do tend to wear faster than other types. They may also hold the heat, which could make them uncomfortable for a horse in hot weather or when working hard.</p>",761
86,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-build-a-round-pen-on-an-budget-1886960,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Build a Round Horse Pen on an Budget</h1>,"<h1>Build a Round Horse Pen on an Budget</h1><p>Building a round pen for our equine friends can be an expensive proposition. Depending on the posts, rails, footing, and size of the round pen it can quickly add up to serious dollars. That being said, it is possible to build a round horse pen on a tight budget.</p><h2>Posts on a Budget </h2><p>The first part of theproject is the posts. The most economical option here is to use regular, wooden landscape posts. These are what you would typically use for your backyard or garden projects. As you can imagine, they are not necessarily meant for long-term wear and abuse. Furthermore, landscape posts are not made of the highest quality wood, and many times you will find many defects in the wood itself.</p><p>However, don't let this scare you off if money is an issue. For a temporary solution, they will work just fine. Spend an extra $15 to $20 and buy 4 inch pressure treated post for your gate posts. In a very short amount of time, you will be delighted that you did.</p><p>Consider landscape posts your lowest cost and a somewhat temporary solution. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day! Landscape posts are an excellent way to get started building a horse round pen and later on, you can always upgrade your materials as your budget allows.</p><h2>Rails on a Budget </h2><p>The second part of our round pen project is the rails. Use 4 inch (preferably 4.25 inch) vinyl rail with integrated metal wire. It usually comes in rolls of 300 to 600 feet. This type of vinyl horse fence is made to withstand a significant amount of force and it holds up incredibly well in the elements over the years. Vinyl has the advantage being a very low maintenance item to use. In fact, you may have noticed that many people nowadays use 2-rail vinyl fences for outlining their property and general landscaping.</p><p>Purchase enough vinyl horse fencing to complete a 3-rail round pen. For example, if you are building a 50-foot round pen, you'll need approximately 440 feet. Don't forget to back out the gate measurement  you will build your gate out of wood, and it will match your round pen fence perfectly. Budget around $50 for your gate supplies and materials.</p><h2>Round Pen Footing on a Budget </h2><p>If you have a sand base, you're very lucky. Build your round pen here and as your budget allows, consider addressing your drainage issues. Otherwise, start with a tiller and till the round pen surface until you have loose soil that's about 4 inches deep.</p><p>Tillers can be rented from many do-it-yourself centers for around $40 per day. To make the most out of your tiller dollars, take a look around your yard. Do you have a garden that needs some help? Perhaps you have a flower bed that could use some rejuvenation. You can combine projects to help lower the overall cost the tiller rental and come out ahead!</p><p>As the natural round pen footing becomes packed down from use, haul in sand to provide a better cushion layer. While a truckload of sand can cost $100 to $200, it is a worthwhile investment. Not only does it provide an excellent working surface for your horses, but it will also help keep your round pen from getting muddy when it rains. The sand can provide better drainage so you don't end up with a round pen pond.</p><p>You can also try mulch or wood products. Your choice should be based on your climate and your natural soil. Without a proper base in your round pen, you run the risk of losing your cushion layer as it may seep into the natural ground.</p><h2>Total Approximate Costs </h2><p>Let's examine the financials of our ""Round Pen on a Budget"" and see where we land.</p><p>Total cost: $540.00 (and you'll have around 200 feet of vinyl rail left over)</p><p>So, don't let a lack of funds stop you from building a round pen. You have a lot of options for controlling costs when building a round pen. Try out this formula and you'll see that you can still give your horses the safety and comfort they have earned.</p><p>Just because your budget may be tight doesn't mean you can't have a beautiful and functional round pen.</p>",711
87,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-put-a-bridle-on-a-horse-1886275,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>How to Put a Bridle on a Horse</h1>,"<h1>How to Put a Bridle on a Horse</h1><p>Before putting a bridle on a horse, start with your horse haltered and safely tied. You may have the horse in cross-ties or tied with a lead rope with a panic snap or quick-release knot. Some people like to leave their horses untied, but that can be a problem in public stables where random people may distract or potentially spook the horse. It's best to avoid your horse getting loose among other horses and people when in the stable; this could lead to accidents. Make sure you use a safety knot if you are not using crossties. You'll also want to brush away any dirt or grit on the horse's face. Before riding, always groom the horse.</p><h2>Secure Your Horse </h2><p>Undo the halter, slide the halter's noseband down over the horse's nose, and slip the crown back up over the horse's ears. This action will secure your horse briefly while you put the bridle on. Stand beside the horse's neck, facing forward with the bridle in your left hand. Slip the reins up over the neck. Both the reins and halter are now around the horse's neck, should it try to get away.</p><h2>Slide the Bit in the Horse's Mouth </h2><p>Hold the bridle up over the horse's nose with your right hand. Using your left-hand fingers, move the bit against his lips and insert your thumb into the space between the front and back teeththe bars of the mouth. If the horse resists taking the bit, wiggling your thumb may encourage the horse to open its mouth wider. Slide the bit in and lift the bridle higher with your left hand so the horse can't spit the bit back out. Be careful around the horse's teeth; you don't want the bit knocking into them carelessly. Eventually, you'll be able to do this in one smooth motion.</p><h2>Pull the Crown Over the Left Ear </h2><p>Grasp the crown of the bridle with your left hand, and with your right hand, gently bend the horse's right ear forward to slip it under the crown.</p><h2>Pull the Crown Over the Right Ear </h2><p>Switch your grasp of the crown of the bridle to your right hand, and with your left, gently slip the left ear under the crown. Do not pull the bridle too high; this action pulls on the horse's mouth. Be careful not to bend your horse's ears uncomfortably.</p><h2>Fasten All the Buckles or Snaps </h2><p>Fasten the throat latch of the bridle. An endurance bridle has a snap at the throat latch. Most traditional leather bridles will have buckles. Do not fasten the throat latch too tightly; you want your horse to be able to flex its neck. Leave about 4 inches of slack. You should be able to slip the width of your hand between the strap and your horse's jaw.</p><p>Unless you use a special noseband, such as a figure-eight, flash, or grackle noseband, leave about two fingers width between the lower jaw and the strap when you attach the noseband or cavesson. If you are using a curb bit, you'll need to fasten the curb chain or strap. Leave the width of two fingers between the chain and the lower jaw. Leaving the chain too loose or tight can make the action of the bit or the chain more severe. If the bit has a port, it could rotate up and hurt the top of the horse's mouth.</p><p>Slip the halter off, tidy your horse's mane and forelock, and you are ready to go. Some people like the forelock under the browband; some leave it over the top.</p><h2>Removing the Bridle </h2><p>Remove the bridle by slipping the halter (attached to a crosstie or lead rope) back over the horse's ears. Undo the throat latch, curb chain, and noseband. With your left hand, reach under the horse's neck and slide the crown over the horse's ears. Hold it as you did when you were putting it on. Gently lower the bit out of the horse's mouth. Be careful not to knock the horse's teeth. With your right hand, slip the halter on and pull the reins up over the horse's neck to completely remove the bridle. Once you remove it, you may wish to clean your bridle or wipe the bit before hanging it away.</p>",713
88,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-the-right-noseband-1886095,Horses > Horse Stables & Equipment,<h1>Choosing the Right Noseband for Your Horse's Bridle</h1>,"<h1>Choosing the Right Noseband for Your Horse's Bridle</h1><p>One of the important parts of many bridles, especially English bridles, is the noseband. The noseband is the part of the bridle that goes around the horse's nose, and the plain versions on English bridles are called cavessons.</p><p>The cavesson doesn't attach to the main part of an English bridle, but rather hangs on its narrow cheek pieces that sit beneath the cheek pieces of the headstall of the bridle. On western and other types of bridles, the noseband may be attached directly to the cheek pieces of the bridle.</p><p>The purpose of the noseband, or cavesson, is simply to help keep the bridle on thehorse. Most horses don't need anything other than a plain cavesson or noseband. However, slight alterations to the simple noseband can increase its usefulness for controlling the horse.</p><h2>Crank Noseband </h2><p>Also known as a Swedish, cinch, or adjustable noseband, the crank noseband uses a leveraged closed mechanism under the horse's chin. A leather strap is threaded through rings or roller bars on either side to achieve leverage before it's secured, allowing for a more precise fit that distributes pressure on the horse evenly.</p><p>Crank nosebands are most common in high-level dressage in which double bridles are used, as these don't accommodate flash nosebands. In hunter and equitation divisions, crank nosebands are considered conventional.</p><h2>Drop Nosebands</h2><p>sv40 / Pixabay</p><p>A drop noseband, also known as a Hanoverian, hangs lower on the horse's face, hanging down below the level of the bit rings and helps prevent the horse from opening its mouth and evading the bit.</p><p>Drop nosebands aren't as popular as crank, flash, or combination nosebands these days. However, they're useful tools for training young horses that need to learn how to accept a bit.</p><h2>Flash Nosebands </h2><p>kirahoffmann/ Pixabay</p><p>A flash noseband, also known as an Aachen, is a small strap attached to the top of the cavesson that buckles underneath the horse's chin. This noseband aids in the horse's mouth shut, so it can't evade the bit.</p><p>Some flashes attach to the noseband with permanent loops, but convertible and removable flashes use a detachable strap or by threading a strap through a slot in the noseband.</p><p>The flash must be properly positioned to work, meaning it needs to be secured approximately two fingers' width below the cheekbone and run straight around the horse's nose. Then, it must be secured under the chin groove. Check to make sure that the flash isn't pulling down on the horse's face because it's not cinched tightly enough. A loose noseband will restrict the horse's airflow.</p><h2>Figure Eight Nosebands</h2><p>The cheek rings of a figure-eight noseband, also known as a crossed, Grackle, or Mexican noseband, sit high up on the horse's cheeks. The straps cross over the horse's nose and buckle under the horse's chin like a flash noseband. It helps keep the horse's mouth shut but may be more comfortable for the horse, as it does not impair the expansion of the horse's nostrils.</p><p>Horses that must jump or gallop hard may be better off in a figure-eight noseband than a flash noseband. That's why this type of noseband is often seen on racehorses.</p>",517
89,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-ten-beginner-horse-riding-mistakes-5667253,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>The Top Ten Beginner Horse Riding Mistakes</h1>,"<h1>The Top Ten Beginner Horse Riding Mistakes</h1><p>Beginning to ride a horse can be a daunting task, and there are several common mistakes that new riders often make. The following are very common issues amongst new horse riders and tips to help correct them so both horse and rider can stay safe.<br/></p><h2>Being Unsafe </h2><p><br/>Riding horses is inherently dangerous. It is also common for long-term and more experienced riders to disregard safety measures, setting a bad example for beginners. Safety equipment used while riding horses is a must. Accidents are unpredictable, and a helmet can save you from brain injury, disability, and even death. All helmets should be ASTM (American Society of Testing and Materials) approved, which lets you know that it complies with essential standards.</p><p>You should also ensure you know the horse you are riding, be prepared for mishaps, and ensure that the areas you plan to ride in are safe and free from hazards. A phone to call for help if needed is a must. Keeping these safety measures in mind allows you to have a fun and relaxing ride.<br/></p><h2>Being Tense </h2><p>Riding a horse as a beginner can be daunting. Horses are large, and you are high up in the air when on their backs. However, being anxious and tense may cause your mount to be nervous as well. Horses feed off of the energy of the humans around them.</p><p>Being tense will also make it impossible to have a correct seat and hand position. It will help if you focus on relaxing, sink your weight deep into your heels to elongate your leg, lower your hands, and move with the horse's motion with your seat.</p><h2>Standing on Your Toes </h2><p>Using your toes to push your weight up and off the saddle can be tempting. This is very common when riders first learn to post the trot. Trying to lift yourself out of the saddle by rocking up (usually hunching the shoulders and trying to ""hop"" out of the saddle) and standing on your tip toes will likely have you behind the rhythm of the trot and double bouncing heavily in the saddle. Your hands may go up as you try to counterbalance yourself. This leads to a grumpy horse and an unbalanced, uncomfortable rider.</p><p>To combat this, you must fix your leg position. Keep your lower leg still, with your feet under you as if you were standing on the ground with your knees slightly bent. Elongate your lower leg and sink your weight into your heel. Learn to use your core muscles to help you post the trot and to move with your horse.</p><h2>Feet Too Deep in the Stirrups </h2><p>When riding, you should always wear some type of boots with raised heels. This will help keep your foot from becoming caught up in the stirrup should you fall off. Not putting your feet too far forward in the stirrups is also critical. The bottom of the stirrup should rest against the ball of your foot.</p><p>Additionally, make sure your stirrups are the proper length. The stirrup should hit your ankle bone when your legs hang free with your feet out of the stirrups. This will enable you to have your foot in the proper position.</p><h2>Slouching </h2><p>Posture is always important, but it is even more so when riding a horse. Riding a horse and having a correct and effective seat is all about balance. If you hunch your body over, not only does this lead to an ineffective seat, but it can also disturb your horse's balance as well.<br/></p><p>When riding, sit up straight, but be relaxed. Use your core muscles to move in sync with the horse's movement. Keep your chin up and look where you are going. You want to stay supple and tension-free.</p><h2>Holding Your Breath </h2><p>As a beginner horse rider, it is natural to be nervous while riding. Sometimes, without realizing it, some beginners will hold their breath while riding. This is a dangerous habit as it can lead to you not getting enough oxygen, becoming light-headed, and you might fall off of your horse.</p><p>Combat holding your breath by taking deep breaths and focusing on your breathing. It can also be helpful to sing or hum a rhythmic tune, such as ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat.""</p><h2>Gripping the Reins Too Tightly </h2><p>Always remember that the reins you are holding are directly connected to a rigid metal bit in your horse's mouth. You must never yank or tug on the reins. Having a constant tight grip on the reins is annoying and possibly even painful for your horse, and they will not understand any other commands as your hands are constantly telling them to stop. Gripping the reins too tightly may also cause you hand cramping and pain.</p><p>You must soften your hands and make subtle adjustments with the reins. Hold the reins firmly but lightly, as if you were securely holding a baby chick in each hand. Don't squeeze too hard and squish your chicks!</p><h2>Looking at the Horse </h2><p>Beginner riders are often fascinated with their horse and want to look at it, or they're nervous and want to keep an eye on it. Looking down means you can't see where you are going. It also causes your spine and seat to stiffen because your head is down and your neck is bent. Any stiffness in your body makes it more difficult for your horse to carry you.<br/></p><p>Always keep your head up and your eyes looking to where you are going. When turning, look at your destination before cueing for the turn. This puts you in better balance with your chin up and your eyes forward.</p><h2>Sticking Your Elbows Out </h2><p>As mentioned above, an effective seat while riding a horse is all about balance. In the beginning, many new riders will struggle to find their balance and will lift their hands and arms, sticking their elbows out to balance their upper body. These movements make it impossible to effectively balance, move fluidly with the horse's movement, and to correctly use your hands.</p><p>Good balance will come with more experience. Aim to move with the rhythm of your horse. Your elbows, forearms, wrist, hand, and reins should all be aligned along with the bit in your horse's mouth. Elbow should be near your body, not poked out to the sides.</p><h2>Going Too Fast </h2><p>This mistake does not refer solely to the speed of riding the horse. Horse riding is a complicated and potentially dangerous sport to engage in. Becoming a safe, confident, and effective rider takes time, patience, and education. Doing too much too soon can lead to disaster.</p><p>Always enlist the help of an experienced horse trainer or coach and never do anything you are not comfortable doing. With time and perseverance, you will gain the necessary skills to have fun and harmonious rides while keeping both you and your horse safe.</p><h2>Final Thoughts </h2><p>Riding a horse can be great exercise and very relaxing. However, when beginning as a rider, it may seem overwhelming. The number one priority for any rider is always safety. Relaxing and moving with your horse with a natural hand, body, and leg position will enable your horse to move comfortably and confidently. Remember that practice makes perfect, and always take it slow</p>",1198
90,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-boots-for-horseback-riding-1885875,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Choosing Boots for Horseback Riding</h1>,"<h1>Choosing Boots for Horseback Riding</h1><p>Most athletes and workers wear proper footwear for their job. It's just as important to wear proper footwear when working around and riding horses. Good boots or shoes help protect your feet if they get stepped on, and help prevent your foot from sliding through the stirrup should you fall off your horse when riding. Flip-flops, high heels, sandals, clogs, garden shoes like Crocs, and canvas running shoes have no place in the barn. Even rubber boots don't provide a lot of protection, although they do come in handy when the weather is wet, or you're mucking out stalls. When you're choosing any type of gear, including footwear, always think 'safety first'.</p><h2>What Not to Wear </h2><p>Boots made especially for riding come in several different styles. Whatever style you choose, any riding boot should have a small tread and a heel that is about 1 inch (2.5cm) to 1  inch high. This will help prevent your boot from slipping through the stirrup. Boots with thick or heavy treads, like hiking boots or snow boots are unsuitable for riding, although they may be suitable for working in the stable. These boots tend to be wide, with a big boxy toe, which means they may get caught on the sides of the stirrup. They also have a lot of grip, which is good while you're hiking but will make it harder to slide your foot in and out of the stirrup.</p><h2>Western Boot Styles </h2><p>Whether you choose an English or western style boot is up to you. Western boots traditionally tend to have a slightly higher heel than English. Some western-style boots have crepe soles, which may not slide out of the stirrup easily. You can also find ankle height boots. This might be more comfortable if you wish to ride in half chaps. But all will provide you with good stability and protection.</p><p>Many of the more inexpensive boots are made with either the upper or lowers, or both made of vinyl. This may be less comfortable for your feet and may break down faster than a good pair of leather boots, which can be repaired. They may not breathe like leather, but they are easier to clean up if they get soiled.</p><p>Packers have become very popular and besides looking smart, they're great for every-day barn wear as well as walking. They are sturdy and provide support for riding while not being as cumbersome as some English boots.</p><h2>English Boot Styles </h2><p>English boots come in several different styles as well. Traditional dress boots; those tall black boots we see in old British hunting scenes are still common in the dressage ring and in eventing and really are correct in almost any English discipline. Some backyard riders and trail riders find that a comfortable pair of tall boots is good protection and support for every day. Other's find them too hot and cumbersome. Field boots look like dress boots but have a lace-up over the instep. These are worn in the hunter show ring and are more comfortable if you have a foot with a high instep. The lace makes it a little easier to get in and out.</p><p>Both types of tall boots may or may not have a zipper up the back so they're easier to get in and out of. If you find a perfect pair of new or used boots, but they are difficult to put on, it is possible to have zippers put in or replaced if they get worn.</p><p>Jodphur or paddock boots are English styles of riding boots that only go up the ankle. They are often worn by children in the show ring, with jodhpurs and leather gaiters, straps that go around the calf just below the knee to prevent the jodhpurs from bunching up the leg. Many adults, wear these, with or without half-chaps for everyday riding. A good pair will be comfortable for wearing around the barn, although you may not want to use leather boots for stall mucking. Jodhpur boots come in pull-on, zipper, or laced styles. Some people prefer the zipper style because they're quick to put on and take off, but feet with high arches can feel cramped in the zipper or pull-on styles.</p><h2>Running Shoe Styles </h2><p>Running shoe style boots are available for those who like a casual look that is both comfortable and durable, and doesn't require the care leather does. They were as comfy as running shoes, with a little extra support in the sole and ankle. They are in fact the perfect thing if you're into a sport like ride 'n' tie that requires you to do a bit of running. Many long-distance trail riders wear these.</p><h2>Materials </h2><p>All of these boots come in different materials from cotton canvas and synthetics to leather. Of course, leather boots tend to be much more expensive and require more care. The better quality the leather and better the construction, the more comfortable and the more expensive the boot will be. Try on a pair of $500 boots, compared to the $100 boots, and you'll quickly feel the difference in comfort and support. A good pair of boots is an investment, and with good care, should outlast the cheaper version by many, many years. You can't deny the feel of good-quality boots, so if new boots are out of reach, comb consignment shops and want-ads for used boots you can afford.</p><p>Both English and western-style boots come in synthetic materials. The main problem with rubber riding boots is that they heat up, hold the moisture and can be really hard to get off, holding like a suction cup to your legs. They're great though when the weather is wet, or if you're only riding in a few small shows and don't want to part with the cost of leather boots.</p><p>Many riders have two or more pairs of boots, depending on how they ride. If you're planning on showing, you will probably need to have separate boots for at home and at the competition. Of course, every discipline requires a different pair of boots, so if you plan to show English and western, you'll probably need both types of boots. Winter riding means you may need a pair of lined riding boots to keep your feet warm. You may also find polo boots or tall boots with a black or brown cuff at the top. These are fine, as long as they are safe and comfortable.</p><h2>Already-Owned Boots </h2><p>You may have something in your closet that will work just fine, without the expense of buying boots made specifically for riding. As long as the tread and heel are appropriate, they aren't too big for the stirrup, they fit well and support your foot, they should be fine. Dress boots with a zipper along the inside of the calf won't be suitable.Always view your horse riding attire with an eye to safety, which is far more important than how you look.</p>",1155
91,https://www.thesprucepets.com/phrases-youll-hear-during-a-riding-lesson-1887294,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Phrases You'll Hear During a Riding Lesson</h1>,"<h1>Phrases You'll Hear During a Riding Lesson</h1><p>The horse-world has its own language, and you'll begin hearing new horse words and phrases as soon as you enter a stable for your first riding lesson. Some phrases you'll hear very frequently as your coach teaches you new skills. Here are some of the most common phrases a beginner rider hears.</p><h2>Schoolmaster </h2><p>Horses that dependably, quietly, and obediently carry learning riders during lessons may be called ""schoolmasters."" Quite often these are older horses whose competition days are behind them, but their knowledge makes them the ideal mount for someone who wants to learn new skills. A retired schoolmaster may make the perfect first horse for a beginner.</p><h2>On the Rail </h2><p>You'll most often begin riding along the rail or on the wall of the riding ring or arena. If you're in the middle, just after mounting your horse, you'll be asked to go out to the rail or wall. You may be asked to track right or left. Tracking left ""on the rail"" means you'll be riding counter-clockwise, and tracking right means you'll be riding on the rail in a clockwise direction.</p><h2>Change Rein </h2><p>While you're riding on the rail, you may be asked to ""change rein."" Changing rein means to change direction. Traditionally western riders change rein by riding in a small loop towards the center line of the arena and doubling back. English riders do the opposite,however, and ride towards the center line (no further than the quarter line) and loop back towards the fence or wall.</p><h2>Change Rein on the Diagonal </h2><p>When you're asked to ""change rein on the diagonal,"" you'll ride around the next short end of the arena, and as you ride into the long side, you'll ride a diagonal line directly to the top of the opposite corner. You'll then proceed along the short side of the arena, going in the opposite direction. If you're riding in a marked dressage arena, a change on the diagonal would be to ride F,A,K to M,C,H.</p><h2>Change Rein on the Short Diagonal </h2><p>If you're asked to change rein on the short diagonal, you'll ride as you did for the long diagonal, but instead of heading for the top of the opposite corner, you'll head for a point along the fence or wall that is halfway along the length of the arena. If you're riding in a marked dressage arena, a change on the short diagonal would be to ride F,A,K to B,M,C.</p><h2>You're on the Wrong Diagonal </h2><p>Being ""on the wrong diagonal"" doesn't mean you're riding in the wrong direction! It means that as you're posting the trot, you're sitting as the horse reaches out with the outside leg, and rising when the leg hits the ground. This is opposite of what you should be doing. Learn to post the trot and remember to ""rise and fall with the leg on the wall.""</p><h2>Heels Down </h2><p>This is probably one thing you'll hear often as you start learning to ride. It's important tokeep your ""heels down"" while riding.</p><h2>Inside Leg to Outside Rein </h2><p>Western riders probably won't hear this, but English riders may start to hear it in their sleep. ""Inside leg to outside rein"" means you'll be using your inside leg to push your horse's barrel towards the wall, and keeping the forward motion, while keeping the shoulders straight with contact on the outside (nearest the wall) rein. Very simply the aim is to attain straightness and flexibility. Most horses will ""bulge"" away from the wall or fence, and their hind quarters may not travel in exactly the same line as the front. Working inside leg to outside rein encourages the horse to work on the correct bend.</p><h2>Ride the Inside Track </h2><p>When you ride on the rail or on the wall, you'll be riding on the outside track. The inside track is around the ring in the arena but about four to six feet from the wall or fence depending on the size of the riding area. ""Riding the inside track"" is a bit more difficult because you and the horse don't have the fence or wall to straighten you out. Exercises on the inside track help you and your horse learn straightness by forcing you to use legs, seat, and rein aids to guide your horse in a perfectly straight line, without the fence or wall as a guide.</p><h2>Ride Down the Quarter Line or Center Line </h2><p>Like riding on the inside track, ""riding down the quarter line or center line"" is often part of exercises in straightness. Without the wall to follow, it's harder to keep your horse perfectly straight. The quarter line is halfway between the wall and center line down the long side of the arena. The center line is, of course, down the center length of the arena or ring. The quarter line is often the starting point for exercises like leg yields and half passes. It's surprisingly difficult to make the turn off the short end of the ring and not make a bulge in your line towards the wall before straightening out. You can prevent this by turning much earlier than initially feels right and looking where you're going.</p><h2>Sit Up, Shoulders Back </h2><p>Or you might hear something like ""open your chest."" My posture is my Achilles Heel, whether on my horse on not. I've always been the ""tall girl"" and try to hide my height by slouching. This isn't good for my back or my horse. Slumping over means you'll be less balanced and flexible and less able to follow your horse's movements. If your horse stops suddenly, you'll already have your weight forward and could become unseated easily. Think of sitting back on your pants pockets, and stretching up as though a string were attached from the top of your helmet to the ceiling (or sky).</p><p>Posture exercises off the horse are also helpful. It's hard to ride a horse with your shoulders back if you tend to walk around or sit at a desk with your shoulders rolled forward. One instructor gave me the helpful image of floating my breastbone up. This made my back feel less stiff than thrusting my shoulders back.</p><h2>Look Up </h2><p>You might also hear something like ""look between the horse's ears."" If the horse you're riding has a low head set, you might actually have to look down to look between its ears. But the idea is that you should keep your chin up and look where you are going rather than looking down at the horse or at your hands. Looking down stiffens your spine, and you want to stay flexible.</p>",1095
92,https://www.thesprucepets.com/an-introduction-to-endurance-riding-1886877,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>An Introduction to Endurance Riding</h1>,"<h1>An Introduction to Endurance Riding</h1><p>Endurance Rides are races over a trail of 50 to 150 miles. Terrain can be varied and challenging. The events are commonly held over one to three days. Horses are checked by qualified veterinarians and judges before, during, and after the ride. Your first endurance ride will likely be a one-day event of about 20 or 25 miles.</p><p>To win you must maintain a fast pace of over 10 miles an hour, but many people ride just to finish. In North America, the U.K., Australia, and many other places, every caution is taken to ensure the safety and health of the horses.There has been some controversy within the sport, because it is very easy to simply wear a horse out, and deaths have occurred. But, in places where the rules of the sport are respected, and the welfare of the horses is the top priority, relatively few injuries or other mishaps occur.</p><h2>What Is the Goal? </h2><p>If you are riding to win, you'll have to learn to condition your horse so that it can maintain asteady, fastpace over long distances. The first horse across the finish line is the winner. For many, the goal is to ride the distance and have their horse finish sound and healthy. The mantra for long distance riders is ""to finish is to win.""</p><h2>What You Will Need </h2><p>Almost any horse, except the heaviest draft breeds, are suitable for endurance riding. Horses with heavy muscles such as cobs, draftcrosses, and ponies may be suitable as long as they aren't pushed to travel too fast. Arabians tend to be the most suitable.</p><p>The most important piece of tack for an endurance rider is the saddle. To begin you may use any saddle that is comfortable and fits both horse and rider. If you stay with the sport, you may want to use a special, or even custom-made endurance or trail saddle. Along with your saddle, you'll need to have at least one girth and saddle pad or blanket, and it's a good idea to have extras, so you can change them if they become wet or soiled.</p><p>There are no rules about the type of bit or bridle you may. Synthetic bridles are easiest to clean.A bitless bridle or endurance bridle makes it easier for the horse to eat or drink on the trail.</p><p>At vet stops, you may wish to use a halter and lead rope, or you may decide to remove the bit from an endurance bridle.</p><p>Sponges and buckets, coolers, rain sheets and blankets are necessary to bring along, so that you may cool your horse out if it is hot, or keep it from getting it's working muscles chilled in cold weather. You'll also want brushes and sweat scrapers to remove dried sweat and mud.</p><p>Feeding your horse on the trail is important. So, you must bring along hay, grain, and supplements. Many endurance riders feed wet beet pulp to provide energy and to get a bit more water into their horse. Dehydration is a danger when a horse is sweating hard, so electrolytes and water are very important. You will also need food for yourself. Keeping yourself hydrated is essential.</p><p>You will also need to dress comfortably and be prepared for any weather. This is another sport where dressing in layers is the best strategy, especially since you'll probably be riding from the cool morning hours and throughout the hottest part of the day. If there's a chance you'll be riding in the dark, a headlamp is useful.</p><p>Your horse will probably need some sort of hoof protection unless you are absolutely sure the trail will be soft footing. Hoof boots will probably be sufficient, but many endurance riders have their horses shod with caulks if the footing is at all rocky or slick.</p><h2>What to Expect </h2><p>When you arrive at the ride site, make your horse comfortable. Participants often camp overnight as starts are often in the early morning hours. At the entry desk, you'll receive your ride package containing a number and score sheet as well as other information.</p><p>You'll take your horse to the veterinariansand judges for a thorough examination. They record information such as TPRs and hydration. You'll be asked to trot your horse out on a loose lead so they can assess its soundness and attitude.</p><p>After the vet check, you'll bed down for the night. Picket lines or portable stalls are common ways of containing horses overnight. You'll want to pre-load your horse with an electrolyte solution and make sure he is eating and drinking.</p><p>Early in the morning, you'll start out on a trail. All competitors start at the same time. These mass starts can be exciting. Some people like to wait at their trailers until the dust settles.</p><p>You'll want to give your horse every opportunity to drink and eat along the trail. Veterinary checks along the way make sure your horse is healthy and sound. Your horse will be checked very thoroughly again at the end. Awards and prizes are handed out after the majority of horses have finished.</p><h2>Preparing Your Horse </h2><p>Your horse should be in good health, and perfectly sound. If your horse is overweight or very unfit, start very slowly. Begin by riding four to six days a week, five miles per workout, at a pace of four to six miles per hour. Gradually increase your time, distance and speed. Start conditioning at least 8 to 12 weeks before the event.</p><p>Before attempting an endurance ride, you may want to participate in some competitive trail rides or mileage rides where you can learn to pace your horse over slightly shorter distances. Ride over varied terrain including steep climbs. Teach your horse to be calm around the highway and off-road vehicles.</p><h2>Preparing Yourself </h2><p>Endurance riding demands a high level of fitness of horse and rider. In addition to riding, consider doing some cardio building exercise. Eat properly, and try to go into the event rested. A tired rider is harder for a horse to carry. (Compare carrying a sleeping child, to one that is awake.)</p><p>Dress comfortably and bring a change of clothing. Know your horse and learn to recognize signs that he may be tired, uncomfortable, or lame. You'll want to recruit a support crew to help look after your horse and you during the ride. Learn how to give your horse electrolytes.</p><h2>At the End of the Day </h2><p>This is a challenging sport. Your goal won't be to win your first endurance ride. Many riders ride just to finish. Riding a horse over a trail of 50 miles or more is an achievement whether you place first or last. You'll get fit, make friends, and learn more with each mile.</p>",1106
93,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-are-the-olympic-equestrian-sports-1886888,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>What Are the Olympic Equestrian Sports?</h1>,"<h1>What Are the Olympic Equestrian Sports?</h1><p>There are three Olympic Equestrian sports: dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping.</p><p>Horse sports such as chariot and riding races were part of the early Olympic games. Riding was first included in the 1900 Olympics and reappeared in 1912. Originally in the modern Olympics, only commissioned officers were allowed to compete. Beginning in 1952, the rules were changed to allow civilians and women. Olympic equestrian events are one of the very fewOlympic sports where women compete equally with men.</p><h2>The Competition </h2><p>All Olympic equestrian disciplines are governed by the rules of the Fédération Equestre Internationale (FEI).</p><h2>What Are the Olympic Equestrian Events? </h2><h3>Dressage </h3><p>Dressage is the systematic training of a horse to carry a rider with ease and grace. Dressage competitions demonstrate the level of training a horse and rider team have attained together. During the test, you will see the horse ridden at different paces and different speeds within those paces. The horses will be asked to fluidly move in straight lines and circles. The horses will also be asked to move smoothly and obediently sideways, diagonally and in place. You will see horses in ""collection"" where the horse is moving with a higher elevation of back and legs, and ""extension"" where the horse is reaching further with its legs while still carrying its neck and back in an elevated frame. Olympic level dressage competition highlights the most advanced and refined riding skills. It is often called the ballet of horseback riding.</p><p>The first Olympic competition was in 1912, although the sport is centuries old. Olympic dressage is scored by five FEI judges; each sits in a different position around the arena. Scores are based on the accuracy and brilliance of each required movement of the assigned test and rated on a scale of 0 to 10.</p><p>Horses and riders at the Olympics compete at the highest level of dressage recognized by the FEI, Grand Prix. Kur or freestyle is a dressage test choreographed to music. The score is based on the accuracy of the movements and artistic impression. The highest score wins.</p><h3>Show Jumping </h3><p>Show jumping tests the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles inside a riding ring. You will see horses and riders jumping over a preset course of 10 to 16 jumps that are up to 6ft 6in (2m) high or wide. Courses are designed with many tricky turns and colorful obstacles challenging both the mental and physical agility of horse and rider. The horse and rider teams must finish within a set time and penalties are given for knocking down rails and other faults.</p><p>Scores are based on the number of jumps knocked down, falls, touches, refusals to jump, and time penalties. The rider with the fewest penalties wins. Ties are broken by jump-offs with penalties and the fastest times used to break the tie. Riders inspect the course before riding to plan the best strategy for jumping these very challenging courses cleanly and quickly.</p><h3>Three Day Eventing </h3><p>Eventing is a test of the skill, versatility, courage, and endurance of horse and rider. Three-day eventing is held over three days and consists of three disciplines: cross country jumping, dressage and stadium jumping. The cross-country phase takes place over a course of natural and man-made objects. There can be up to 40 obstacles that horses must jump or go through over the course that is up to four miles long. Scores are based on refusals, coming in under or over a set time, and falls of the rider.</p><p>Read more about Olympic Equestrian Rules and Scoring.</p><h2>Equipment and Venues </h2><h3>Dressage </h3><p>Olympic dressage is held in a flat 20 X 60-meter arena. The horses wear minimal tack which are usually black in color. At the Olympic level, bridles will be a curb bit with a bridoon (sometimes called a double bridle). A plain cavesson, flash, figure-eight, or drop noseband may be used. Saddles will be dressage style with a straight flap and a white square saddle pad. No boots or wraps may be used.</p><p>The riders wear a shadbelly tailcoat, yellow vest, top hat, white gloves, white breeches, and black tall boots.</p><p>Horses will have their manes braided and may be banded with white tape. Tails may be braided but are usually left flowing to encourage natural tail carriage.</p><h3>Three Day Eventing </h3><p>Rules for tack, clothing, and arena for dressage and jumping are similar to these individual sports. The cross country course consists of jumps made of very solid natural type obstacles. During the cross country phase, riders will be seen wearing jerseys and helmet covers in their team colors, an ASTM/SEI helmet, gloves, and body protector. Riders wear eventing watches with a large readout that allows them to keep track of their time and alert them when 'optimum time' has been reached.</p><p>Horse's tack will be similar to jumping, but boots are secured with tape and shoes may have studs for extra grip on tight corners. White-colored ""leg grease"" is also seen on some horse's front legs to help them slide over fences they may hit.</p><h3>Olympic Show Jumping </h3><p>Olympic show jumping courses will be colorful with many technical twists and turns. Course designers will include spread jumps, verticals, and combinations. The spaces between obstacles will be set up so that riders must control the length of each stride to set up properly for the next jump.</p><p>Tack includes a forward seat saddle that allows support and security for riding over fences. At the Olympic level, white square saddle pads are used. There are few restrictions on the types of bridles, bits, and martingales. Some horses may wear hackamores and bitless bridles. Boots, wraps and other protective gear can be worn.</p><p>Riders must wear ASTM/SEI approved helmets, buff, tan, or white breeches, and will most likely be seen wearing a team jacket.</p><p>Horses are well groomed. Tails may be braided and manes will be pulled and may be braided.</p><h2>How Do They Win? </h2><p>Each country may have a maximum of three riders competing for individual medals in the dressage competition. There may be four riders from each country in jumping and five in eventing competing for individual medals.</p><p>Show jumping placings are determined by the fewest knock-downs, penalties and fastest times if there is a jump-off. Dressage placings are determined by the highest scores with 100 percent being the ideal score.</p><p>Eventing medals are determined by the combined scores for all phases. In all cases, the combined scores of all team members are calculated to find the winning team in each event.</p>",1077
94,https://www.thesprucepets.com/whip-or-crop-while-horseback-riding-1886222,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Using a Whip or Crop While Horseback Riding</h1>,"<h1>Using a Whip or Crop While Horseback Riding</h1><p>Whips and riding crops areone of the most iconic symbolsof horseback riding, but considering how they are sometimes used, it's almost a pity. A whip or riding crop can be a useful tool if used wisely. Conversely, they can be instruments of torture if used in anger or for coercion. There is definitely a right way and a wrong way to use these artificial aids. One doesn't have to go far to see a crop being overused or used ineffectively.</p><p>Properly used, a whip is an extension of your arm or leg. If your horse is trained to move forward in hand with a tap on the top of the haunch, this cue can also be used while you are riding to reinforce your leg and seat aids. If your horse is a bit lazy, just the presence of the whip is often enough to motivate them to pay more attention to your cues. A few taps with the whip can be enough to encourage a balky horse to move forward or push a hesitant horse to cross a bridge or water crossing. A whip may also be used to encourage a horse to put more effort into approaching a jump or simply march straight through a field filled with lush grass rather than put its head down to steal mouthfuls as you ride. The important thing is to make sure that your use of a whipis a last resort.</p><h2>Misuse and Abuse </h2><p>If however, you find yourself using a whip to do more than tap your horse, you are in danger of overusing the aid and making your horse either frightened or belligerent. People who use whips to try to bully horses find they may compound the problem. If the problem is something like getting a horse to cross a stream, hitting them with a whip may make them even more anxious as the horse associates being hit with the scary water crossing. This will only make it more hesitant to cross waterthe next time you are out. Hitting a horse can be counterproductive. A horse should never be hit hard enough to leave any mark on the skin or hair coat. A tap is acceptable, but if you're using your full arm to apply the whip, you are probably misusing it.</p><h2>Using a Whip From the Ground </h2><p>While on the ground you can use a whip to cue your horse to step forward while leading itand the whip allows you to reach further back to tap the horse's haunch. A quick wave of the whip in front of your horse's face can make a pushy horse halt and pay attention quickly. Using a whip in this way allows you to keep a safe distance from your horse and your hands safely on the lead line. For groundwork, a long dressage whip, ""TTeam"" wand, or 'carrot stick' is the easiest to work with.</p><p>A whip is a very useful aid when lunging and most of the cues you give will be through the lunge whip. A lunge whip never touches the horse but is popped or pointed, depending on what you are asking your horse to do.</p><h2>Riding With a Whip </h2><p>From the saddle, a whip reinforces your leg and seat aids. When a horse is a being sluggish or hesitant, first apply natural aidslegs, seat, and handsto ask it to move on. If you sense the horse is not taking the cue seriously, tap lightly asking the horse to 'wake up'. This needs to be done instantaneously, so the horse connects the action of the whip with the leg and seat aids. The tap needs to go behind your leg, and that's one reason why dressage whips are longer than riding crops.</p><p>Crops are a bit shorter and they are used to tap the shoulder of a horse, rather than reach behind the rider's leg. To tap further back requires the rider to hold the reins in one hand while using the other to reach around behind the rider's leg or the horse's haunches.</p><p>Whips or crops used in schooling a horse can be held on either side of the horse, depending on which leg you wish to target. If your horse has a habit of spooking, you may wish to carry a whip on the side it spooks to remind it to stay straight. Always remember to use your leg and seat aids first, howevereven to correct a spook. It is very easy to rely on artificial aids such as whips without learning how to properly use natural aids. In the show ring, there is a right and wrong side to carry a whip, so check the show rules for your particular discipline. For example, many people school their horseswith dressage whips, but whips are not allowed in most dressage tests.</p><h2>How to Hold </h2><p>To hold a whip properly while riding, the handle of the whip goes across your palm, with the button end up. This way, it will be parallel with the rein you are holding. If there is a loop on the handle, slide this over your hand as far as your knuckles. This is so the whip or crop won't slide downwards as you ride. You don't want to slide the loop around your wrist because should you fall off, your wrist will be held against the whip, which is potentially injurious. You're better off letting go of the whip when you fall.</p><p>Dressage whips often have a large button on top that prevents them from sliding out of your hand. If it doesn't, it can be helpful to wrap a 'donut' of tape around the top. You may find it most comfortable and balanced if you hold the whip a few inches down the handle, rather than right against the top. The whip then lays across your thigh, ready to reinforce your leg aid.</p><h2>Driving With a Whip </h2><p>A whip is almost a necessity when you drive your horse. A long driving or buggy whip allows you to cue the horse on its haunches since, of course, it's impossible to cue it with your hands, legs, or any other natural aid but your voice. Again, the whip is only used to tap the horse.</p>",1038
95,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-wear-at-an-english-horse-show-1885876,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>What to Wear at an English Horse Show</h1>,"<h1>What to Wear at an English Horse Show</h1><p>If you are planning on showing yourhorsein an English horse show, you will need to make sure you are properly dressed. The presentation is important. Looks can make or break how well you do. You should be wearing the correct clothes to make the best impression on the judge.</p><p>Specific shows may have rules about the dress andtack(horse equipment and accessories) they require and you should peruse all rules to make sure your horse complies. The tack includes the saddle, stirrups, bridle, bit, halter, reins, and so on.</p><p>It is important to know the clothing and tack differences between styles of English horse shows, too, such as the hunter class, jumper class, and dressage.</p><h2>Why Clothes Matter </h2><p>When it comes to smaller shows, the best strategy is to stick to conservative and traditional. Your clothes should look neat and well pressed. It is respectful to the judge and show's organizers to take care of the horse and rider. Everything should be spotless and your boots well polished and clean.</p><p>Chances are you do not have to go out and buy all new clothing or tack. You may be able tofind used items, or even borrow a few things until you decide what you need and want. Also, keep in mind that unless you want to draw attention to your hands (and you probably do not) your gloves should match your sleeves as much as possible.</p><p>If you are an English rider but will be competing in line, conformation, turn-out classes, trail classes, or speed games learn more about Western horse showto get a grasp on the expectations there, which are different from the English guidelines.</p><h2>Hunter Class </h2><p>Expert horsemen judge hunters subjectively on the basis of their style and movement, conformation (horse bone structure and musculature), and overall picture. There are two types of hunterclasses, the show hunter, which exhibits on flat terrain, and the working hunter, which may have to jump fences.</p><p>In regard to riding clothes, the hunter world is one place where the English discipline relaxes a tad and strays a bit beyond the strictly traditional. While the conventional black velvethelmet(American Society for Testing and Materials-approved) may be worn, jackets and shirts may be a little more creative. Something like a brown check jacket with apeach-colored shirt would be appropriate, although it is never wrong to go with hunter green, navy, or black jacket with a white shirt. Coordinating breeches (or riding pants) may be in tan, fawn, olive, brown, or another neutral. You should include a belt and field boots.</p><p>For horse tack, an all-purpose or close contact saddle is appropriate along with a regular English bridle. Depending on specific rules, certain types of bits, martingales, or nosebands may or may not be used.</p><h2>Jumper Class </h2><p>In the jumper divisions, judging is entirely objective, based on physical completion of the course and points are awarded or deducted based on faults and rails down, and so on. Quite simply, a hunter is judged based on personal judgment; and in the jumper round, the fastest clean round always winsregardless of style.</p><p>For the horse, an all-purpose saddle may be sufficient for small shows, but a jumping saddle will help the rider maintain a secure seat.</p><h2>Dressage Class </h2><p>Dressage is a word that comes from French meaning ""training."" Dressage is ahighly skilled equestriansport defined by theInternational Equestrian Federation, where the horse and rider are expected to perform from memory a series of predetermined movements.</p><p>The dressage ring is very traditional. Each rider will be wearing almost identical clothing with little room for personal touches. Your hair should be neatly secured. During your presentation, you will want to emphasize the smoothness of your horse's gaits making sure no part of your apparel, including your hair, bounces. A low bun or hair net is appropriate. If your hair is curly, you will need a fine mesh net to prevent straggling curls from escaping. Keep makeup to a minimum. Your helmet should be black velvetor covered by a black velvet cover.</p><p>At schooling shows, you can wear subtly checked or modest tweed jackets, although deep navy is acceptable and black is more proper. Dressage jackets are rather longer than those worn in the jumper or hunter ring. When you sit on a chair, the hem of your jacket should just rest on the seat when you sit nice and straight. Riding pants may be fawn, pale beige, or white. White breeches are the classic color for the dressage ring, but unless you have an entourage of grooms to look after your horse, it is almost impossible to stay clean. It is best to present at a show in a pair of smudge-hiding beige breeches than dirt-marked white ones.</p><p>Your shirt should be white. In very hot weather a tank top can hide beneath your jacket, while a snowy dickey or bib and stock collar shows in the front. A choker collar is also acceptable at low levels. Be prepared, though, in case jackets are excused in hot weather. In that event, you will want a neat and presentable shirt. A stock pin is pinned so it secures the stock tie, and this is the one bit of personalization you can indulge in. A fine filigree initial or other subtle design is acceptable. You may use stock ties subtly patterned or in very light pastels at the lower levels.</p><p>Boots should be classic dress boots, not the field boots with laces that you often see in the hunter ring. But, if that is all you have, they are acceptable at the lowest levels. Kids can wear jodhpur boots with gaiters. Unless the show is very casual, half chaps are not appropriate. Of course, boots should be polished. Learn how to spit polish and make sure all other clothing is clean and pressed.</p><p>For the horse, an English bridle and saddle are appropriate, and as you advance in levels, you will want a dressage saddle. Your saddle pad should be a square dressage pad, snowy white, and spotlessly clean. Your horse's mane should be braided and bound with elastics or thread that matches its color. Leg wraps are generally not used.</p>",1018

People used to ride bareback because they did not have saddles, but it's still something that can come in handy. It is warmer in the winter and less cumbersome if you only have a minute for a quick ride around the paddock. Riding bareback will also help you know how your horse moves as you feel its muscles working beneath you. Learn how to get your horse ready for some bareback riding and warning signs that your horse might be uncomfortable.</p><h2>Preparing Your Horse </h2><p>You will want to use a quiet, calm horse with smooth gaits and a healthy back. Horses with high withers can be uncomfortable to ride bareback. If you are concerned about becoming chafed, apply some petroleum jelly to the sensitive area before heading out. Before you begin, be sure you have mastered the halt, turning, walk, thesitting trot, posting trot, and thecanter/lope in the saddle with and without stirrups.</p><p>A saddle helps distribute the weight across a horse's back. Without it, your weight will rest in a smaller spot, so make sure your horse is comfortable. You may want to start bareback riding for just a few minutes a day. A good time is after your ride. Your horse will be warmed up, and you can remove the saddle and ride bareback for a short time.</p><h2>Mount the Horse Bareback </h2><p>Because you will not have stirrups to use to mount up, you will have to use a mounting block or have someone give you a leg up. You can use a handy fence rail to mount up. But it can be difficult to get your horse lined up and standing still while you balance precariously on the fence. A sturdy mounting block is safest.Do not stand on anything flimsy that might collapse as you stand on it. And do not line your horse up along something that it could get a bridlestrap or reintangled with.</p><p>Keep your horse near the mount. If your horse is not lined up and ready, you could fall. Watch for your horse's cues and only mount when the horse is not moving and ready for you.</p><h2>Maintain a Comfortable Position </h2><p>Once aboard, get comfortable and make sure your horse is comfortable. A good position is the same as in the saddle. You want bareback riding to improve your riding overall, not become a way to develop new bad habits. Be aware of the alignment of your ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. Aim to be light in your seat so you aren't a dead weight on the horse's back.</p><h2>Start With a Lead </h2><p>Get someone to lead the horse at a walk. Have him or her walk forward, turn, halt, and back-up so you can get used to the feeling. When you and your horse are feeling secure walking while led, take up the reins and start, steer, and stop withsomeonealong for security.</p><h2>Practice Proper Form for Trot, Canter, or Lope </h2><p>Repeat the procedure with your horse moving at both a sitting and posting trot. You should be able to post without stirrups or a saddle. To canter, you may want someone to lunge the horse. Keeping your balance in a relatively tight circle is a tad more difficult. On the lunge concentrate on maintaining your seat.</p><p>Keep your legs long and heels down. Think of letting your weight sink through your ""seat cushions'"" and down through your legs. Keep your seat springy. Stay relaxed and flexible and do not forget to breathe. Holding your breath keeps your weight high and will not be comfortable for you or your horse.</p><h2>Keep Balanced and Avoid Confusing the Horse </h2><p>Without a saddle or reins, you need to keep yourself balanced and not confuse your horse. If you start to lose your balance, do not clench with your legs. Your horse could understand this as a cue to move forward more strongly. You can use a handful of mane to steady yourself at first. Holding on to the mane is more secure than using a neck rope or strap because there is no chance of the horse's mane slipping side to side.</p><p>Many people have a tendency to lean back and let their legs push forward, or they hunch forward and bring their heels up. Either tendency will erode your overall security and skill. You want to stay balanced, and leaning backtoo far means if your horse moves suddenly, you might get left behind.</p><h2>Try Longer Rides </h2><p>When you feel balanced and in control and when your horse seems confident and comfortable, you can head out on your own. Stay in the ring or arena or small fenced paddock until you feel completely confident at all gaits. When you become very good at riding bareback, you might want to try riding out on the trail. If you do, consider how you will get back on if you have to dismount. You might have to make creative use of rocks, logs, or fence rails.</p><p>Going up steep inclines can be a challenge without a saddle. Lean forward to get your weight off the horse's back, and use handfuls of mane to prevent sliding backward. Whatever you do, do not use the reins for balance. That will confuse and hurt the horse.</p><h3>Tips</h3><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Bareback riding should only be uncomfortable for a horse that has pain or discomfort at the exact spot the rider's seat bones rest. It is a different sensation than a saddle, so your horse may just need time to get used to it. If it seems very uncomfortable, examine its back for any irritation or speak to a vet right away. You'll also want to monitor your horse's back for soreness after any longer bareback rides (or if it's new for them).</p><p>Finally, some riders and horses are not good fits for bareback riding. Particularly heavy riders, horses with any back issues, or a very slender-backed horse may want to avoid bareback riding.</p>",998
97,https://www.thesprucepets.com/riding-habits-you-dont-want-1886055,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>11 Riding Habits You Don't Want</h1>,"<h1>11 Riding Habits You Don't Want</h1><p>Riding a horse is just sitting right? Nope! Staying on and controlling a horse requires the same sort of muscle strength and coordination that many other sports requirelike ballroom dancing, martial arts, downhill skiing, and others. You need to learn how to use your body and balance to make your ride more comfortable, safe, and easier for your horse.</p><p>However, it's easy to pick up bad riding habits, especially if you don't regularly work with a trainer. Here are eleven of the most common problems to watch out for as you learn to ride your horse.</p><h2>Loose and Flat Hands </h2><p>It's common for new riders to either let the reins slide through their fingers or let their hands hang flat.</p><p>Remember to close all fingers around the reins with a firm but gentle grasp. Imagine holding a baby chick and that's the right amount of pressure with which to hold the reins; you don't need a death grip, but hold them with enough force to prevent them from slipping through your fingers and becoming too loose. Your thumbs should be rotated up to prevent you from holding your hands flat, with palms facing the ground. Flat hands make it more difficult to give effective rein aids and holding the reins too loose means your horse can easily pull them through your fingers.</p><h2>Slouched Shoulders </h2><p>When riding a horse, we constantly have to check and correct our posture and keep our shoulders back. Slouching your shoulders means you may have a more difficult time maintaining a good seat and effective rein aids. Over time, poor posture can lead to back and shoulder pain.</p><h2>Leaning Forward Too Frequently </h2><p>Leaning forward is sometimes necessary, such as when jumping. However, when doing flat work (not jumping), leaning forward throws off your center of gravity when on a horse and can make it hard to cue your horse properly. Additionally, if your horse stops abruptly or spooks suddenly, this action tends to push you forward out of the saddle. If you're already leaning too far forward, you may be unbalanced enough to then fall forward over your horse's shoulder.</p><h2>Heel Position </h2><p>""Heels down"" is something most beginner riders will hear frequently from their coach. Making sure your heels are pushed down will help keep your foot in a proper position in the stirrup. Additionally, heels that are down increase the contact between your leg and your horse's body. This help you communicate with your horse and gives you a much more centered and secure seat in the saddle.</p><h2>Stiff or Heavy Hands </h2><p>Stiff and heavy hands are as bad as hands that are flat and loose. Heavy hands are harder on the horse though, because if you ride with heavy hands you'll be putting too much pressure on the horse's mouth. This can cause problems like head tossing and rearing. To prevent this bad riding habit, don't clench your hands around the reins as if making a fist. Hold the reins firmly but gently.</p><h2>Looking Down </h2><p>Looking down means you won't be looking where you are going. This affects your center of balance and doesn't allow you to prepare yourself for what's ahead, especially when jumping or on the trail and encountering various obstacles. When in the saddle, focus your gaze roughly ten feed in front of the horse.</p><h2>Leaning in on Turns </h2><p>While banking your turns may be desirable when riding a bicycle, you don't want to lean inside as you ride circles or bends on horseback. In order for your horse to balance easily around tight turns, you want to keep your own balance as centered as possible. Leaning inward makes this more difficult on the horse. A good example is a way many barrel racers take tight turns. You'll see they actually keep their weight low and centered in the saddle, allowing the horse to make the bend quickly and efficiently.</p><h2>Sitting Chair Seat </h2><p>Sitting in a chair position on a horse is a very common problem. This means you are sitting back and slouching down, as if you were reclining in an easy chair. This type of riding shifts your center of balance too far back on the horse and also pushes your legs too far forward and away from the horse's body, making it harder for your to communicate. Additionally, this posture in the saddle makes it hard to cue your horse with the reins, post or sit the trot, and keep your arms and hands in the correct position.</p><h2>Hollow Back </h2><p>As we're told to sit up straight and push our shoulders back, we may actually over-compensate and hollow out our backs. Having a hollow back affects your position in the saddle, affecting our balance and our ability to move with the horse. It also causes excess strain on our back and over time may result in back pain.</p><h2>Pinching With the Knees </h2><p>In an effort to grip with our legs and stay on our horse, many of us pinch with our knees. This makes it hard to apply leg aids and affects your position in the saddle. It can make posting the trot more difficult and add bounce when you try to sit the trot. Try to relax at the knee and keep your heels down. Focus your grip on your calves and your thighs.</p><h2>Stiff Elbows </h2><p>Your elbows should always remain at your side while you ride unless you're going over a jump or you need to release your horse's reins when they cough or trip. After your horse has landed or recovered, elbows should be back at your side. Keeping your elbows straight and stiff affects your balance and ability to effectively cue your horse.</p>",941
98,https://www.thesprucepets.com/an-introduction-to-dressage-riding-1886876,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>An Introduction to Dressage Riding</h1>,"<h1>An Introduction to Dressage Riding</h1><p>Many people have seen Olympic or Grand Prix level dressage on television. The horses seem to do intricate maneuvers as the rider sits almost motionless. Dressage isn't just fancy moves with hard to pronounce names! Every time we train our horses to carry us with more ease and respond to subtle aids, we are training them in basic dressage. Dressage is teaching a horse to be supple, balanced and responsive.</p><p>A kur is a dressage test ridden to music. You are given a set of required elements and create your own test to instrumental music you choose. Some tests can be ridden in pairs or teams.</p><h2>What Is the Goal of Dressage? </h2><p>The goal of dressage training is to develop a horse's flexibility, responsiveness to aids, and balance. This makes the horse stronger and more pleasurable to ride. If you compete, you will always be competing against yourself, as well as others taking the test. The goal of the competition is to always improve your own score.</p><h2>Equipment You'll Need for Dressage </h2><h2>What to Expect at a Dressage Test </h2><p>When riding a dressage test, you will be evaluated by up to three judges. The judges will give you a score on every element of the dressage test as you ride. They will look for obedience, suppleness, accuracy, attitude, and how well you ride.</p><p>The dressage ring is marked at its perimeter with letters. Before you enter the ring, you will hear a bell or a whistle. This lets you know you have a certain time to enter the dressage ring before you are penalized. You will enter and salute the judge. After halting and saluting the judge, you will ride in straight lines and circles as described by your test using the letters as your guide.</p><p>You will ride at different gaits and variations within the gaits. For the basic levels, you don't need to have the test memorized. Someone may call out the dressage test from the sidelines. You may also choose to sit or post the trot. When you have completed your test, you will halt, salute the judge, and leave the ring. At the end of the dressage competition, you will receive your scorecard, with a final score.</p><h2>Preparing Your Horse for a Dressage Test </h2><p>Work on improving your horse's or pony's flexibility and responsiveness. It's important to train slowly. Forcing a horse into 'frame' could cause sore muscles and a reluctant horse. Your horse might learn to carry his front end properly, without learning to drive with his hind-end. This can cause soreness and a reluctant attitude. Help your horse learn his lessons completely and allow his muscles time to adjust to moving in a different way than he may be used to.</p><p>Practice each element of the dressage test without riding the entire test repeatedly. The judge is looking for willingness and obedience to your cue, not how well your horse can memorize! Practice so that you're collected, working and extended gaits are distinct, and the halts are square.</p><p>If you only spend time dressage training your horse, you will soon feel you are going to spend every minute ordering him around. Spend some time trail riding so he has a chance to stretch, use all of his muscles, and develop cardiovascular fitness. Allow time for relaxation and fun.</p><p>For the test, you will want your horse spotlessly groomed, his mane braided and tack cleaned.</p><h2>Preparing Yourself for Riding Dressage </h2><p>Dressage training is hard work. Dress in comfortable layers according to the weather. It will be easier for you if you have the placement of the letters memorized before riding a test. You can easily make arena letters out of up-turned detergent buckets, pylons, or scrap wood that can be painted or written on with a waterproof marker.</p><p>If you don't already work with a coach, finding one that has dressage experience will make it easier than trying to work alone. As you train your horse, you'll be learning how to cue more accurately using your seat, hands,and legs. You will also need to concentrate so that you can ride each movement with intention and precision. Plan what you will work on each time you ride and learn to focus on one element at a time.</p><p>For the test, you will wear your English riding habit. Women will wear their hair in a net or bun.</p><h2>The Benefits </h2><p>Basic dressage training is valuable whether you plan to compete in the sport, or in any other discipline. Jumpers, trail horses, pleasure horses, and English and western show horses can benefit from dressage training. Your horse will become more athletic and obedient and you will become a better rider.</p><p>If you compete in dressage you'll quickly find that the greater challenge is trying to improve your score, not just bringing home a rosette. With every element receiving a mark out of 10, you will be able to see what aspects you need to practice before you ride the next test. You will be able to progress through the levels at your own pace. Kurs allow you some creativity and a change from standard tests.</p>",847
99,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-post-the-trot-1887042,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>How to Post the Trot</h1>,"<h1>How to Post the Trot</h1><p>If you have ever tried sitting on a trotting horse, you may have found the experience very uncomfortable. The trot can be very bouncy, but there is a way to smooth out the bouncing and jarring. Posting is to rise out of the saddle seat for every other stride of the horse's forelegs, thus smoothing out the jolts you will encounter if you just sit. This makes riding the trot much more comfortable for you and your horse. It doesn't matter if you ride English or western. There are times when trotting is appropriate and more comfortable, no matter how you ride.</p><h2>Supplies for Trotting </h2><h2>How to Post the Trot </h2><p>The easiest way for you to learn and the most comfortable for the horse is to begin learning to post the trot on a lunge line. This way, you can learn to stay with the horse without worrying about steering or inadvertently pulling on the bit and confusing or hurting the horse.</p><p>If you aren't able to start on a lunge line, try riding your horse in an arena or fenced ring where it will be inclined to trot in a straight line without much guidance from you.</p><h3>Practice Sitting Two-Point or Half Seat</h3><p>Lift your bottom out of the saddle, tense but don't grip tightly with your upper legs and stand slightly in the stirrups. Try to control the stance with your muscles, rather than by putting all your weight in the stirrups. You'll have the same position as a martial arts 'ready stance' or a downhill skier. Do not use your hands to steady yourself.</p><h3>Cue the Horse to Trot </h3><p>Make sure you are feeling relaxed and secure at the walk before cueing your horse to trot. The cue is a pressure of the legs, sitting deeper in the saddle, or a tap with the heels, depending upon the schooling and sensitivity of the horse.<br/></p><h3>Feel the Bumps </h3><p>With your horse at a steady trot, try to sit and keep your back flexible to absorb the bumps. The upward and forward thrust you will feel is called the impulsion.</p><h3>Lift With the Impulsion </h3><p>Allow yourself to be lifted by the impulsion. If your horse has very little impulsion, you will find sitting the trot very easy. If your horse has strong impulsion, you will be lifted out of the saddle. Some beginners bend forward during impulsion. Your back should be almost vertical, with only your pelvic bones making the up and forward arc.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Don't try to pick yourself up with your upper body. Your shoulders should stay relaxed. There shouldn't be a lot of brute strength involved in posting. A few muscles might start to complain, and you could get winded.<br/></p><h3>Smooth the Bumps </h3><p>Once you have discovered the rhythmand it may be helpful to count one, two, one, twotry rising on ""one"" and gently lowering on ""two"". The action is up and forward with the pelvis, standing in two-point and sitting on every other stride. Continue this rhythm as your horse trots steadily. Try to stay with the motion to avoid getting left behind and 'double bumping'.</p><h3>Keep Your Legs Still </h3><p>Concentrate on keeping your lower leg motionless from the knee down. Don't lift with your toes, grip excessively with your knees, let your legs to swing, or let your ankles to cave in. Many beginners shove their feet forward. Looking down, you should not be able to see your toes. The basic position of the good seat is maintained at every gait.<br/></p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If the inside of one leg is getting rubbed, check that you are sitting square in the saddle. Check that your stirrup leathers are the same length. Compensate for differences in leg length with a shim in your boot. Most people have one leg longer than the other affecting balance in the saddle. Chafing on both legs means your legs are swinging. Practice keeping your lower leg still and wear riding pants with leather knee patches or tall boots for extra grip.</p><h3>Pick Up the Reins </h3><p>Now that you can feel the rhythm and are able to post while on the lunge line, you can try picking up the reins. The challenge will be to keep your hands still, while your body moves up and down to the rhythm of the strides. Don't let your hands move up and down, but flex through shoulders and slightly through the elbows and wrists.</p><h3>Keep Practicing </h3><p>Don't feel discouraged if you still get bumped around a bit, or your friend gets it right away, and it takes you two or three lessons. You  learn to post, and soon you will not be aware you are doing it. Practice as much as you can and soon posting will be an effortless habit that makes the riding the trot much more comfortable for you and your horse. With enough practice, you will find you can post without stirrups or even a saddle.</p>",820
100,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-mount-a-horse-to-ride-1887063,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>How to Mount a Horse to Ride</h1>,"<h1>How to Mount a Horse to Ride</h1><p>Your very first step to learning to ride is learning to get on the horse. The first few times you get on a horse, whether you have a saddle or are riding bareback, have someone hold the horse's head so that it stands quietly.</p><p>You can and should be able to get on from the ground. However, a mounting block is easier for you, gentler on the horse's back, and better for your saddle. Make sure the mounting aide is sturdy and safe. Rickety fence rails, old chairs, and thin plastic buckets can be hazardous when used as a mounting block.</p><p>If you don't have a mounting block, and your horse is tall and your legs are short, you can drop the stirrup a few holes so that you can reach it with your toe. You can also use a stirrup extender. Don't forget to readjust the stirrup leather to the proper length once mounted.</p><p>It is traditional to mount a horse from the near side (the left). But you should be able to mount from the offside as well.</p><h2>Start Safely </h2><p>Lead your horse out of the stable. It is unsafe to get on a horse in a confined area with low roofs or narrowdoorways. If you are riding an English saddle, run the stirrups down the leathers to hang free.</p><p>Getting on isn't all about strength. The first few times, it will feel like getting on is a struggle. Soon, you will learn to use your balance to help you spring into the saddle.</p><h2>Check Your Equipment Before You Get On </h2><p>Before you get on, check to see if your girth or cinch is snug. Do a last-minute check to see if all your bridle buckles are fastened. Check that your stirrups are the correct length.Make sure you have a helmet on. In your excitement to ride, small details are easy to overlook.</p><h2>Stand Beside the Horse </h2><p>Hold both reins in your left hand and gather them with a tuft of mane. Hold the off or right-side rein a tad tighter to help prevent the horse from swinging away from you as you get on. Turn the stirrup with your right hand so that the leather or fender lies flat when you are sitting in the saddle. Many people face more forward when mounting. This foot placement makes it less likely that you will poke your left toe into the horse as you are rising. Many people learned to face towards the back. In this picture, the rider is standing so that she's facing slightly to the front. Face whichever way you prefer.</p><p>If you face backward, turn the stirrup clockwise towards you. If you face front, turn the stirrup a half a turn counter-clockwise. Taking a moment to position the stirrup ensures you do not end up with the leather or fender uncomfortably twisted under your leg once you are seated.</p><h2>Get in Position to Get On </h2><p>Lift your left foot into the stirrup, so the ball of your foot is resting comfortably on the bottom of the stirrup. You should have the reins and tuft of mane grasped in your left hand; your right hand will now grab the cantle of your saddle. Your right leg will be balancing your weight and ready to spring.</p><h2>Lift Off </h2><p>Use your right leg to push you up. You won't be pulling yourself up with your arms. Your hands and arms are only there for balance.The spring of your leg should propel you upwards. It sometimes helps to do a few tentative springs to gain upward momentum.</p><p>As you become balanced over the horse's withers, let go with your right hand, moving it up to grasp the reins. At the same time, swing your free leg (right leg, if you're mounting on the traditional side) up and over the saddle's cantle. Lift your leg high enough that you don't kick your horse in the haunch or hit your leg on the back of the saddle. Settle gently into the saddle. Coming down with a thud is uncomfortable for your horse and may even startle it.</p><h2>Arrange Your Reins and Stirrups </h2><p>Arrange the reins so that you are holding them properly. Some people like to use their right hand to turn the stirrup leather, so finding the stirrup is easier. Or, use your toe to find the offside stirrup and place your foot in the stirrup, so the ball of the foot is resting comfortably. You are now ready to ask your horse to walk.</p><p>If at any time the horse starts to move off while you're trying to get into the saddle, slide off. Stop the horse, quiet it, and start over. It is safer to be either fully on the ground or in the saddle when dealing with an anxious horse. Next, learn to dismount properly.</p>",801
101,https://www.thesprucepets.com/safety-equipment-while-riding-horses-1885884,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Equipment For Safe Horse Riding</h1>,"<h1>Equipment For Safe Horse Riding</h1><p>Horseback riding can be a dangerous sport. Riding safely means staying comfortable and not letting injuries ruin your fun. Safety equipment won't keep you completely injury free, but in the case of an accident, may help reduce the severity of injuries.Wearing and using things like a helmet, riding boots, a crash vest, and safetystirrups can make your ride safer and if you're a novice rider, may make you feel more confident in the saddle.</p><h2>Helmets </h2><p>Charles Owen Inc</p><p>If you invest in no other piece of equipment, you should at least buy a riding helmet. In aninterview with Riders4Helmet's co-founder Lyndsey White, she quotes a NEISS (National Electronic Injury Surveillance System) study that indicates that in the year 2007, 12,000 head injuries were caused by handling and falling off horses. She also quotes a neurosurgeon that claims horseback riding accounts for most sports caused head injuries. [Can we link to this or verify?]</p><p>There are many arguments against wearing a helmet, but most are just excuses, and a refusal to look at the reality that riding a horse is a risky endeavor, no matter how well trained, old, or quiet our horses may be. It's not a matter of skill. The horse world in the last few years has lost several accomplished riders, even Olympic-level competitors, all because they weren't wearing helmets.</p><p>Head injuries aren't completely avoidable, but many can be lessened or circumvented altogether through helmet use. Choose an ASTM approved helmet that fits well and wear it every single time you ride to protect your head and brain.</p><h2>Boots </h2><p>Boots serve two purposes. A riding boot with a small heel will help prevent your foot slipping through the stirrup and provide some protection if your toes get trampled. Tall boots also protect your leg from chaffing while you ride and from getting scraped by branches and shrubs as you trail ride.</p><h2>Stirrups </h2><p>There are many types of stirrups with features to help you stay comfortable and prevent your foot from sliding through if you take a fall. If your foot runs through the stirrup when you fall, you could be dragged and badly hurt. Safety stirrups lessen the risk of your foot getting jammed.</p><h2>Safety or Crash Vests </h2><p>Price Grabber</p><p>Safety vests help protect your torso if you fall. Crash or safety vests help prevent injury to your internal organs, your spine and your ribs. These heavily padded, but lightweight vests are commonly worn by rodeo riders and eventers. More often, crash vests are seen on long distance riders, jumping, pleasure riders, and speed games competitors. They can be hidden under dressage jackets. Pleasure and trail riders suggest wearing a quick-dry top underneath the vest if you're concerned about it being too hot during the summer. Eventers wear them under a colorful jersey.</p><p>There are a few different styles, and they do come in different colors so you'll want to try a few on before buying one. One style has an air system that is triggered when the rider is ejected from the saddle. Some are suitable for ATV, dirt bike and horse riding and all come in child as well as adult sizes.</p><h2>Mouth-Guards </h2><p>You may not have considered wearing a mouth-guard while riding, but over jumps, where doing a face plant into a fence is a possibility, mouth-guards may be a wise consideration. Your dentist will be able to fit a mouth guard, similar to those worn for hockey, football or other rough sports.</p><p>Alternatively, you can buy mold-able mouth-guards from drugstores. These won't fit as well or provide the same level of comfort or protection, but they may help prevent a gapped smile and a lot of pain. However, mouth-guards can be awkward to wear, prevent you from talking to other riders or your horse, and may get dirty from dust, depending on where you ride. Some riders wear them as special, short-term safety devices (e.g., bronc-riding, over a high jump course, etc.) and not all the time.</p><h2>Chaps or Half Chaps </h2><p>While half chaps or chaps won't prevent major injuries, they do protect your legs from scrapes and scratches when trail riding and from being chaffed against the saddle. If you've ever ridden with badly rubbed calves, especially after your horse starts sweating, you'll appreciate the extra layer of protection synthetic or leather chaps can provide.</p><h2>Gloves </h2><p>Gloves protect your hands and give you a bit of extra strength and grip. This may be useful if your horse pulls. Horses can blister hands by pulling while riding out on the trail. Any reasonably fitted pair of gloves can be used, as long as you can hold the reins comfortably. Leather-palmed crochet-backed gloves for summer and lined leather gloves for winter are usually best.</p>",780

Flowing scarves, baggy pants, bulky sweaters with loose waists, and other sloppy or loose clothing can get caught on the saddle if you should fall off. Getting caught half-way down means you could get dragged, and that is far more dangerous than falling clear of the horse.</p><p>Be sure to determine what appropriate riding clothing is right for you.</p><h2>Attaching Yourself to the Saddle or Horse </h2><p>Of course, you want to stay on the horse and not fall off. However, it's a big mistake to tie yourself to the horse, or the saddle or reins in any way. If you do fall off, you want to fall free. This lessens your chance of getting dragged, which could result in far worse injuries than just hitting the ground.</p><h2>Letting Go of the Reins </h2><p>The reins help you control the horse. If you get scared, your reaction might be to toss the reins and hold on for dear life. This could confuse and frighten your horse, especially if you lean down and grab it around the neck.</p><p>Even if you are scared, hold onto those reins, and listen to what your guide or coach is telling you. When it feels like things are going wrong, don't panic, take a deep breath and do as you're told.</p><h2>Wearing the Wrong Footwear </h2><p>Flip-flops, sandals, heels, trainers, clunky hiking boots, and other inappropriate footwear can lead to disaster if they slide through or get wedged in a stirrup.</p><p>The first time you ride, try to find footwear that is as close to a riding or cowboy boot as possible. That way, you are less likely to get caught in a stirrup if you fall off. You don't want to hit the ground with your foot wedged in a stirrup.</p><h2>Thinking You're Just Going to Sit There </h2><p>Many people think that riding is just a matter of having the horse just carry them around and all they have to do is just sit there. But, riding is much more than just sitting in the saddle and letting the horse do all the work. Riding is an activity that requires practice, skill, coordination,and balance.</p><h2>Not Listening Closely </h2><p>If you're taking a lesson or going out on a guided tour, it's really important to listen to what you are being told.</p><h2>Not Trusting Your Coach </h2><p>If your coach tells you to ride the bay horse, but you think you'd like to ride the pinto, keep in mind that the coach probably has a reason for picking that horse for you.</p><p>The other horse may look like it's giving its rider a really good ride, but that may be because that rider already knows how to get the best out of the horse because they're a bit more advanced. Coaches are good at matching riders with horses. So while it's fair to ask, ""maybe one day, can I ride that one?"" for now, trust the coach's choice.</p><h2>Trying to Hold the Saddle to Stay On </h2><p>Saddles and stirrups make sitting on a horse more comfortable, and aid in helping the rider keep their balance, but they shouldn't be used to help you hold on. It can turn into a bad habit, and if you really do start to fall, holding onto the saddle may shift it to one side. Holding on tight as it turns could result in you just getting dragged, rather than falling clear of the horse.</p><p>Good riders know how to shift a saddle back into place if they feel it turning, but you won't know how to do that on your first ride. Instead, if you are a feeling unsteady, grab the horse's mane if you must, or the strap that your coach can put around the horse's neck for that purpose.</p><h2>Skipping the Helmet </h2><p>Even if the horse never moves or travels faster than a walk, always wear a helmet.</p><h2>Quitting </h2><p>After your first ride, you're going to realize that riding is much more than just sitting there. You're going to have some sore muscles, and you may feel confused about some things. That's because you've used your body in a way it is not accustomed to.</p><p>When it comes to horses and riding, learning is a life-long journey. Don't be discouraged if you weren't able to ride off into the sunset the first time out. Like any skill, regular practice will increase your knowledge and ability.</p>",766
103,https://www.thesprucepets.com/am-i-too-big-for-my-horse-1886154,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Are You Too Big for Your Horse?</h1>,"<h1>Are You Too Big for Your Horse?</h1><p>One of the most common questions people ask when buying a horse is: Am I too big for this horse? The size of the horse should be proportional to the rider, but weight alone is not the only factor to consider. Height and riding skill comes into play when it comes to making the horse's job easier and the rider feel secure and comfortable. So, in some cases, a smaller horse will do just fine with a heavier rider. Conversely, a smaller but less skilled rider can be more difficult for a larger horse to carry, making a larger horse's back sore and creating leg soundness problems. When selecting the right size horse, it's important to consider a number of factors.</p><h2>Riding Skill </h2><p>Riding skill is an important element that influences how easily a horse can carry a rider. This may be almost as important as the rider's size. A rider who is a skilled equestrian, balanced in the saddle, and has a good seat will be easier for the horse to carry than a rider who is inexperienced and sloppy in the saddle. If you've had the experience of carrying a child who is awake versus a child who is asleep, you'll know what a horse feels like when carrying a rider who holds himself up, compared to a rider who is loose and unbalanced.</p><p>It won't take long before a horse who must carry an unbalanced rider develops back and soundness problems; these can also lead to behavior problems. Improving your riding skills makes your ride more comfortable, safe, and secure. It will also allow your horse to be more comfortable, sure-footed, and stay sound much longer. Make an effort to improve your riding skills by taking lessons and paying attention to equitation when you ride.</p><h2>Considering Weight </h2><p>When people wonder if they're too heavy for their horse, their main concern is weight. There is debate about this percentage, but the general rule is that a horse should carry no more than 20 percent of their weight. Remember that this weight also includes the saddle and other riding equipment, in addition to the rider. An overweight horse cannot necessarily carry a heavier rider. The calculation should be made with the horse's ideal weight.</p><h2>The Horse's Age </h2><p>When a horse is very young, it has developing joints and bones; when a horse reaches its senior years, it will likely begin to become arthritic. Very young or very old horses should carry less weight. The overall workload of young horses that are still growing and older horses that may have joint issues needs to be lighter. This refers to the weight of the rider, along with the time and intensity of any workload.</p><h2>Considering Height </h2><p>Height is another factor that impacts a rider's security in the saddle. If you are tall, you may feel very top-heavy on a shorter horse with fine bones. A solidly built horse, such as an Icelandic, or Fjiord might be more comfortable, even though it is short in relation to many other breeds like Arabians and Thoroughbreds. Anything that makes you unbalanced will make it harder for your horse to carry you.</p><h2>Selecting a Horse and the Right Equipment </h2><p>When you are selecting a horse, try many different sizes out. If you're on the heavier side consider a breed like a foundation type American Quarter Horse or a draft or draft cross. If you're slender, then an Arabian or Thoroughbred might be ideal. If you have your heart set on something like an Arabian, look for a horse with thicker bone. Bone is measured at mid-canon on the front leg. The higher the circumference, the more sturdy the horse is. On Arabians, an 8-inch bone is considered quite sturdy.</p><p>It's also important to make sure you have the right-sized equipment and a properly sized saddle. The saddle is essential to distribute your weight correctly on the horse, keeping you balanced and will make sure the horse does not become sore. With the right match, both you and your horse will be more comfortable and less stressed during your rides.</p>",717
104,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mistakes-to-avoid-when-you-tack-up-to-ride-1886295,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Mistakes To Avoid When You Tack Up to Ride</h1>,"<h1>Mistakes To Avoid When You Tack Up to Ride</h1><p>Getting ready to ride takes a bit of attention to detail. You want you and your horse to be safe and comfortable. Here are mistakes to watch for as you tack up.</p><h2>Inattention to Grooming </h2><p>It's always a mistake not to groom your horse's back and girth area before you ride. Grit, burrs, or other debris can become lodged in your horse's hair coat, especially when the hair is thick in the winter time. This can lead to chaffing, galls or discomfort that can make your horse misbehave. Always groom the saddle and cinch area before you put the saddle pad or blanket and saddle on your horse.</p><p>Another grooming mistake is to skip checking your horse's hooves before you tack up to ride. Objects can get lodged in the bottom of the hoof, that can make your horse's feet sore. And, you may miss problems like thrush and white line disease that can get worse if not treated promptly. A loose shoe can cause lamenessand can trip your horse, which could injure both of you. Clean and check hooves each time you tack up--and when you are done riding.</p><h2>Wrinkled, Dirty Saddle Pad and Blankets </h2><p>Always check that your pads or blankets are clean. Dirt build up can cause chaffing and things like twigs, burrs or other debris can cause discomfort that can make your horse misbehave. When you put the blanket or pad on, be sure it's perfectly smooth, and there are no folds or wrinkles where the saddle sits.</p><h2>Skipping a Quick Tack Check </h2><p>Each time you ride, you should do a quick visual tack check. Look for loose or frayed stitching, stretched or cracked leather, fractured rings or buckles, worn or sharp edges on bits and any other damage or wear that could make your saddle, bridle or bit come apart while you ride. Bits with sharp edges exposed can make a horse cranky and misbehave. Nails poking through fleece on the underside of saddles can also cause discomfort. Get in the habit of doing a quick check of your tack every time you ride, and do a thorough check when you clean it.</p><h2>Careless Bridling </h2><p>Avoid sloppy bridling habits that can make a horse head shy and create hazards. When putting the headstall over the ears, be gentle. Some horses dislike having their ears folded. Don't do the noseband or throat latch-up too tight. Be sure the buckles are done up correctly, so the bridle doesn't come loose when you ride. A horse that is uncomfortable while being bridled can become more difficult to bridle as time goes on.</p><h2>Making Biting Uncomfortable </h2><p>Be careful not to clank the bit against your horse's teeth, pinch or pull at its lips or shove a frosty cold bit in its mouth. These things can make your horse resentful about taking the bitand make it difficult to tack up in the future. Again, check your bit for signs of wear, rough or sharp edges or joints that pinch. This can make your horse uncomfortable and an uncomfortable horse might react by misbehaving.</p><h2>Doing the Cinch Up Quickly and Tightly </h2><p>Girth or cinch up slowly. Don't do the girth or cinch up so tight it leaves an impression on your horse when it's removed.Make sure the girth/cinch and all the straps that attach to it are lying flat. Going slowly gives the horse time to relax and many horses will bloat their bellies while you are tacking up, leaving the cinch much looser than you realized. If you're using a western saddle with a knotted cinch, make sure the knot is laying flat when you finish typing it.</p><h2>Not Doing a Final Check </h2><p>Check the girth or cinch. In the short walk from your tacking up area, to where you mount up, the girth may have loosened because your horse has relaxed. Always do a double check before you mount. Check that your reins aren't twisted, and any other equipment you're using such as martingales or breast collars are adjusted properly.</p><p>On an English saddle, check that the stirrups are down on both sides. That way you won't get into the saddle, bang your thigh on the offside stirrup and have to sit unbalanced, fiddling with it before moving on.</p>",709

Controlling a strong horse may not be as simple as riding in a more severe bit; all horses are strong enough to pull a person out of the saddle.</p><p>Several factors may contribute to a horse pulling at the reins, including poor saddle fit, lack of outdoor time, dental problems, fear or lack of confidence, lack of training, a rider's heavy hands, and confusing or conflicting commands which lead to a horse's frustration. Figuring out why your horse is pulling away from you will help you determine the best way to fix the problem.</p><p>Once you have discovered why your horse is hard to control, you are on your way to a solution. You won't be able to force a horse to do what you want if it is feeling pain. Look after saddle fit, dental work, health issues, or hoof issues first. It's not fair or reasonable to expect a horse to be obedient if it is sore from any of these things.</p><h2>Consider Digestive Issues </h2><p>Keep your horse as ""naturally"" as possible. If it can't be turned out (allowed outside) all of the time on pasture to graze, be sure that it eats in a head-down position, and that it has ample time to be outdoors, and roll, run, and buck when it is feeling energetic. If its diet is high in concentrates, cut back while still providing good quality hay or pasture grass.</p><h2>Check Rider Position </h2><p>Sometimes we develop bad habits when riding and inadvertently teach our horses less than desirable behavior. These can range from poor seat position and heavy hands to mistimed cues and other habits that can confuse and frustrate a horse. Consider taking a few lessons to brush up on your riding skills.</p><p>Another thing to consider as you ride is if you are giving your horse a chance to anticipate what will come next. Do you ride quietly through forest trails and then kick your horse into a gallop when you come to an open field? Your horse may become excitable, anticipating what's ahead.</p><h2>Retrain Your Horse </h2><p>It won't be a mistake to take your horse back to the basics. Even if your goal is to trail ride, a strong, hard-to-control horse will benefit from schooling. The aim is to develop greater obedience. Ride circles, serpentines, loops, and other patterns at varying gaits. Keep your horse's mind busy and focused on what you are asking it to do.</p><p>You may want to start from the very beginning, lunging for obedience, and teaching voice aids. It's also essential to anticipate where a problem might occur and take steps to avoid it before it happens. If you're not sure how to go about this, a riding instructor or trainer can help you out.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing the Behavior </h2><p>Don't try to win a battle of strength with your horse; you'll always lose. If you feel your horse pulling the reins, keep a strong seat and leg and observe what's going on for clues as to why your horse is acting this way. Stay calm, talk to your horse in a low voice, and slowly bring him back to a walk if possible. Sometimes turning in circles will help re-focus the horse, or transitioning to walk/trot multiple times to get him more receptive to listening to you at a controlled speed.</p><h2>Common Mistakes </h2><p>If you don't keep a proper grip on the reins, they become too long and the horse will be able to pull away more easily. Remember that your horse's head moves slightly with each step, so you should keep your arms at your sides, and allow them to move with the natural motion of the horse's gait instead of letting the reins slip through your fingers.</p><p>You need to find the balance between giving your horse enough rein and gripping too tightly so it becomes confused.</p><p>A horse that chronically takes control and pulls too much forward may either need a stronger, more advanced rider, or may need serious professional retraining. If you have recurrent issues with your horse, talk to a trainer for more one-on-one guidance.</p>",708
106,https://www.thesprucepets.com/learn-to-jump-1886042,Horses > Riding & Equestrian Sports,<h1>Jumping in Horseback Riding</h1>,"<h1>Jumping in Horseback Riding</h1><p>Many beginner riders are attracted to the sports of stadium jumping and cross-country jumping. Field hunting and hunter shows are very popular as well. Even Western riders face the occasional jump, whether in trail classes or riding out on trails. While you might not want to make a careerof riding horses over jumps, it is valuable to know how to go over a jump in a way that's safe and comfortable for you and comfortable for your horse.</p><h2>Jumping Is Optional </h2><p>Having said that, however, it's important for beginners to understand that you don't have to jump, even if you only plan to ride English. There are lots of disciplines that English riders can participate in that don't require jumping such as dressage, English pleasure, equitation and flat classes such as road hack, le tree, distance riding, mounted games, polo, and polocrosse. Nevertheless, for the reasons mentioned above, it is good to know how to approach and go over a jump.</p><p>Of course, you'll want to be wearing an approved helmet, proper boots, and make sure your tack is in top-notch condition. You don't want to find out that a worn girth strap won't hold when you're coming down out of a jump. Many ridersshorten their stirrup leathers a notch or two, but you might not feel the need to do this until you've been jumping small heights.</p><h2>Develop a Secure Seat </h2><p>Your first step in learning to ride over jumps is to work with a coach or instructor to develop a secure seat at all gaits from a walk to hand gallop. You should also be able to ride these gaits securely in two points or half seat. It's common for instructors, especially those teaching kids, to hurry through the basics and get the student jumping before they're really secure. After all, jumping can be loads of fun and it's pretty glamorous too. This is often a mistake and ultimately leads to unsafe, unhappy riders and unhappy horses.</p><p>It's difficult to say how long it will take to develop a secure seatit varies for every rider. A really keen, athletic rider on a well-schooled horse may be able to start jumping after a few months of lessons. Others may take longer, either because they aren't as athletic, or are keen but apprehensive. This is where a good instructor or coach can make a big differencesomeone who will know when to give the student a little motivational push, without overwhelming them.</p><h2>Riding Over Poles </h2><p>After you have mastered the basics, you can start riding over poles. Often instructors will start with just one pole, that will be ridden over at the walk. You will then learn to walk and then trot over a line of poles, both at a posting trot and two-point seat. Once you've mastered that, you'll start cantering over the line. It's important to understand the spacing between the poles so it's easy for you and your horse to accomplish this exercise safely. This is where your coach is a good resource.</p><h2>Progressing </h2><p>As you land, sit gently down in the saddle, and bring your hands back to the normal position. Be sure not to fold your legs back or push them forward. Your leg position should not change greatly from riding on the flat.</p><p>After you have mastered a small line of cross rails, you will gradually increase the height of the jumps. As you become skilled at riding jumps in an arena or ring, you will graduate to riding different types of jumps, including oxers (jumps that are two or three rails wide), water jumps, and other more complicated and intimidating (at least for the horse) types of jumps. Jumping cross country or field hunting is even more challenging as you learn to deal with distractions and solid jumps that don't fall down if your horse hits them.</p><h2>Jumping on Trails </h2><p>Western and trail riders probably won't go beyond the cross rails stage. Most often, if a trail rider encounters a downed tree or another obstacle on the trail, it's easy enough and safer to find a way around. In trail classes any jumps are quite smalla test of obedience, rather than jumping skills.</p>",694

Sometimes turning in circles will help re-focus the horse, or transitioning to walk/trot multiple times to get him more receptive to listening to you at a controlled speed.</p><h2>Common Mistakes </h2><p>If you don't keep a proper grip on the reins, they become too long and the horse will be able to pull away more easily. Remember that your horse's head moves slightly with each step, so you should keep your arms at your sides, and allow them to move with the natural motion of the horse's gait instead of letting the reins slip through your fingers.</p><p>You need to find the balance between giving your horse enough rein and gripping too tightly so it becomes confused.</p><p>A horse that chronically takes control and pulls too much forward may either need a stronger, more advanced rider, or may need serious professional retraining. If you have recurrent issues with your horse, talk to a trainer for more one-on-one guidance.</p>",708

Field hunting and hunter shows are very popular as well. Even Western riders face the occasional jump, whether in trail classes or riding out on trails. While you might not want to make a careerof riding horses over jumps, it is valuable to know how to go over a jump in a way that's safe and comfortable for you and comfortable for your horse.</p><h2>Jumping Is Optional </h2><p>Having said that, however, it's important for beginners to understand that you don't have to jump, even if you only plan to ride English. There are lots of disciplines that English riders can participate in that don't require jumping such as dressage, English pleasure, equitation and flat classes such as road hack, le tree, distance riding, mounted games, polo, and polocrosse. Nevertheless, for the reasons mentioned above, it is good to know how to approach and go over a jump.</p><p>Of course, you'll want to be wearing an approved helmet, proper boots, and make sure your tack is in top-notch condition. You don't want to find out that a worn girth strap won't hold when you're coming down out of a jump. Many ridersshorten their stirrup leathers a notch or two, but you might not feel the need to do this until you've been jumping small heights.</p><h2>Develop a Secure Seat </h2><p>Your first step in learning to ride over jumps is to work with a coach or instructor to develop a secure seat at all gaits from a walk to hand gallop. You should also be able to ride these gaits securely in two points or half seat. It's common for instructors, especially those teaching kids, to hurry through the basics and get the student jumping before they're really secure. After all, jumping can be loads of fun and it's pretty glamorous too. This is often a mistake and ultimately leads to unsafe, unhappy riders and unhappy horses.</p><p>It's difficult to say how long it will take to develop a secure seatit varies for every rider. A really keen, athletic rider on a well-schooled horse may be able to start jumping after a few months of lessons. Others may take longer, either because they aren't as athletic, or are keen but apprehensive. This is where a good instructor or coach can make a big differencesomeone who will know when to give the student a little motivational push, without overwhelming them.</p><h2>Riding Over Poles </h2><p>After you have mastered the basics, you can start riding over poles. Often instructors will start with just one pole, that will be ridden over at the walk. You will then learn to walk and then trot over a line of poles, both at a posting trot and two-point seat. Once you've mastered that, you'll start cantering over the line. It's important to understand the spacing between the poles so it's easy for you and your horse to accomplish this exercise safely. This is where your coach is a good resource.</p><h2>Progressing </h2><p>As you land, sit gently down in the saddle, and bring your hands back to the normal position. Be sure not to fold your legs back or push them forward. Your leg position should not change greatly from riding on the flat.</p><p>After you have mastered a small line of cross rails, you will gradually increase the height of the jumps. As you become skilled at riding jumps in an arena or ring, you will graduate to riding different types of jumps, including oxers (jumps that are two or three rails wide), water jumps, and other more complicated and intimidating (at least for the horse) types of jumps. Jumping cross country or field hunting is even more challenging as you learn to deal with distractions and solid jumps that don't fall down if your horse hits them.</p><h2>Jumping on Trails </h2><p>Western and trail riders probably won't go beyond the cross rails stage. Most often, if a trail rider encounters a downed tree or another obstacle on the trail, it's easy enough and safer to find a way around. In trail classes any jumps are quite smalla test of obedience, rather than jumping skills.</p>",694
