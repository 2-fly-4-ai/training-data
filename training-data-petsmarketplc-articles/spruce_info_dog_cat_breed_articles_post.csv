Cats with big eyes are seriously cute, and some have an anime-cartoonish quality to them. Breeds with big eyes include familiar breeds, like the pretty Persian or the more exotic Tonkinese or Singapura. Eyes are one way that your cat communicates.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Medically speaking, big-eyed cat breeds do not have a higher tendency to have eye conditions as a group. However, of the top big-eyed breeds, Persians and Burmese are more prone to cataracts, a condition when the eye lens becomes white and cloudy. All cats, no matter the breed, can develop cataracts in their old age.</p><p>These are the top 15 cat breeds with large eyes.</p><h2>Cornish Rex</h2><p>Often popping up on the list of curly-coated cats or best hypoallergenic cats, the Cornish rex is no stranger to being at the top of specialty cat breeds. But this time, it's for this breed's captivating gaze. The Cornish rex has a triangle-shaped head that lends to its oval-shaped eyes' prominent position and size. The eyes are often gold in color, though green, blue, brown, and hazel eyes are also possible.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 11 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Tight, curly short hair with a triangular head and over-sized, wide-set ears</p><h2>Devon Rex</h2><p>Similar to the Cornish rex, the Devon rex usually gains fame for its curly coat. However, this breed also has large oval-shaped eyes that give it an out-of-this-world look. The svelte body paired with the large eyes and wide, triangular ears mean these cats command attention when they saunter into a room.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 9 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Fine to medium bone structure with broad chest and triangular head; soft, thin, curly coat</p><h2>Singapura</h2><p>One of the tiniest felines also happens to be a cat breed with the most enormous eyes. The Singapura, which originated in the streets of Singapore, is The International Cat Association's (TICA) smallest registered cat breed. It is best known for its large, expressive eyes and affectionate, playful nature. The Singapura's almond-shaped eyes are hazel, green, or yellow. The large, wide-open eyes are an integral characteristic of the breed. The breed standard states explicitly that small eyes are a severe fault for this breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 6 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 8 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Petite but muscular stature; rounded head and large eyes</p><h2>Sphynx</h2><p>Usually known for its hairless skin, the sphynx is also known for its arresting gaze and nearly human-like expressions (and personality). Maybe it's the lack of facial fur, but there's no denying that the sphynx will draw you in with its large and uniquely shaped eyes. The breed standard describes its eyes as lemon-shaped,&rdquo; with the eyes of this cat breed having a wide-open center that comes to a point at either side of the eye. While a variety of eye colors are possible for this cat breed, icy blue, aqua, and green shades especially highlight the big gaze of the sphynx.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Hairless body, with skin pigmentation providing various color types; long limbs and arched back; triangular head with lemon-shaped eyes</p><h2>Persian</h2><p>Perhaps owing to the Persian's small, flat face, the round, full eyes are prominent on this exotic-looking cat breed. Persians are also known for sporting bright blue, green, or copper peepers that strike a beautiful contrast with their long, fluffy coats. However, odd-eyes or heterochromia (one blue, one copper) is also possible.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-sized body with long coat; full, flat face with round eyes</p><h2>Scottish Fold</h2><p>The most distinctive feature of the Scottish fold might be its ears, which appear to fold over and lay flat against the head. But not to be overlooked is the fact that the Scottish fold has rounded, large eyes that, together with its ears, give these cats a quintessentially cute look. Scottish fold eye colors include copper, gold, blue, and green. They are notably well-rounded in shape. The broad nose in the center of the face separates the eyes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 13 pounds (males); 6 to 9 pounds (females)</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Round face and body with an overall compact appearance; folded ears and large, rounded eyes</p><h2>Burmese</h2><p>The Burmese cat as we know it today results from a cross of the native copper cat of Burma (Myanmar) with the Siamese. All Burmese cats trace their heritage to a female Burma kitty named Wong Mau. Another feature that all Burmese cats share is large round eyes in glowing green or gleaming gold.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short coat with long legs and expressive, rounded eyes; coat is primarily sable, champagne, platinum, and blue</p><h2>Tonkinese</h2><p>Gaze into the eyes of a Tonkinese kitty, and you may not be able to look away. In addition to having large, rounded eyes, these cats have exotic eye colors like aqua, sky blue, violet, and gold. The breed developed as a cross between the Burmese and the Siamese, which have striking coat colors and varied genes. Together, this heritage gives the Tonkinese big, colorful, unique-looking eyes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-sized body with short fur; open, almond-shaped eyes in bright hues like aqua, gold, and blue</p><h2>Russian Blue</h2><p>The beautiful Russian blue is another top cat breed with big eyes. These cats have a triangular head with round, wide-set eyes that always seem to be watching you-except for when a cat nap is in progress. What's most interesting about this cat breed's eyes is the fact that all kittens are born with yellow eyes. As the kitten matures, the eyes will slowly transition to green, the expected eye color of this big-eyed cat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 15 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Fine-boned with long limbs; triangular head with distinctive green eyes and broad nose; plush double coat in blue-gray</p><h2>British Shorthair</h2><p>Nearly all features of the British shorthair are round, and the eyes of this cat breed are no exception. These cats have large, round, and well-opened eyes. Pictures of the breed often feature a blue coat paired with gorgeous gold eyes, but many coat colors and eye colors are possible, including green, blue, and copper.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 17 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Round face and body with males having heavy jowls; short but dense coat in both solid shades including white, blue, and black along with tabby, calico, shaded, or bi-color variations</p><h2>Abyssinian</h2><p>The Abyssinian is an exotic-looking cat for many reasons, not the least of which is its large and expressive eyes. Interestingly, these cats have somewhat almond-shaped eyes that are fairly unique in the feline world. This cat's peepers have a distinctive angled corner and aren't the typical round shape of many large-eyed cat breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Silky coat in short to medium length; slightly arched back with long limbs; triangular ears and almond-shaped eyes</p><h2>Chartreux</h2><p>The Chartreux is a cat breed with round eyes that seem to be always alert and ever expressive. A national treasure in France, the Chartreux cat has a uniform blue-gray coat, and its eyes are also somewhat standard in color, ranging from copper to gold. The most desirable eye color is a deep orange hue that nicely complements the Chartreux's blue coat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 12 to 16 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Round head and thick body; solid blue-gray coat with a somewhat wooly texture that varies in shade from light ash to slate gray</p>",1265

Whether it be their unique physical characteristics, a feature in a movie, or their affectionate personalities, they have left a lasting, positive impression on cat aficionados globally.</p><p>A cat is either domestic, purebred, or a hybrid. Domestic cats do not have a pedigree history of their lineage, while purebred cats do. Hybrids are domesticated cats crossbred with wild feline varieties. The main pedigree certifying organization, the United States-based Cat Fanciers' Association, recognizes 45 distinct purebred cat breeds.</p><h2>Siamese</h2><p>Popular since the 19th century, this cat breed originated in Thailand (formerly known as Siam). The Siamese has been a foundational breed for the Oriental shorthair, sphynx, and Himalayan. Most Siamese cats have distinct markings called ""points"" that are the areas of coloration on their face, ears, feet, and tail. Two varieties of Siamese cats have an ""apple"" shaped head and chubbier body and the other features a larger head and slender body. The animated Disney film ""Lady and the Tramp"" featured Siamese cats singing a song, demonstrating their intelligence and vocal skills. Many Siamese cats that originated from Thailand had a kink in their tail-a trait bred out of most Siamese, but you can still see it in street cats in Thailand.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 8 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat in seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac with blue eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Persian</h2><p>Also lovingly referred to as one of the ""smushed-face"" cats, the Iranian cat or Shiraz cat (named for a city in Iran), Persians have beautiful, long fur coats. They can come in almost any color and have a flat face when compared to most other breeds of cats. Persians are featured in many movies, artworks, and commercials and have been one of the most popular breeds of cats for decades. Their coats demand regular grooming, otherwise, matting will result. Like many purebreds, they are prone to a variety of diseases, including renal and cardiac problems.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long coat in solid (white, black, cream), tabby, calico, bi-color, silver and gold, shaded, and smoke</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Maine Coon</h2><p>Known for its large stature and thick fur coat, the Maine coon is a cat that is difficult to ignore. Hailing from the state of Maine and the state's official cat, the Maine coon is a gentle giant. They are great hunters and were popularized after the CFA recognized them as purebred in the late 1970s. They remain one of the most popular cat breeds. Many Maine coons have polydactylism, or extra toes, which makes their already large feet even larger. This great feature helps for hunting in the snow since large feet act as snowshoes. The classic Maine coon coloration is a brown tabby, but this breed can come in almost any color.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, double coat with more than 75 color combinations and green, gold, or copper eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Ragdoll</h2><p>Ragdoll cats get their name from their docile temperament. They tend to go limp when picked up, much like a rag doll. At one time, people thought they couldn't feel pain, but that is not true. Ragdolls look a lot like long-haired Siamese cats with pointed color patterns. They also have distinctive blue eyes and dog-like personalities, following their owners around the house.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length and silky with many different colors and patterns with blue eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 25 years</p><h2>Bengal</h2><p>Bengals are wild-looking cats-literally. Their markings make them look more like they belong in the jungle rather than in your home, but they are domesticated. They are talkative and require a lot of exercise. They come in many colors with patterns like spots and rosettes. Their name comes from the Asian leopard cat's taxonomic name, Bengals were initially bred from domestic cats and a wildcat. They also get their beautiful patterns from this wildcat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 13 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Shorthaired, spotted, or marbled coat with patterns in black, chocolate, or gray/silver with green or gold eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Abyssinian</h2><p>Originally from Ethiopia (previously known as Abyssinia), the Abyssinian cat has a distinctive ruddy agouti coat that gives the Abyssinian its unique banded look. It has tall, pointy ears; a wedge-shaped head; and a slender and muscular body. Personality-wise, Abys are active, curious cats that frequently follow owners around. Their playful, dog-like demeanor endears them to their humans.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short-haired red/orange agouti fur coat with bands of light and dark coloring; other colors can include cinnamon, fawn, and blue</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Birman</h2><p>Birmans are another color-pointed cat like the Siamese and ragdoll. They have blue eyes and a medium-long coat but no undercoat, the primary trait that sets them apart from Persians and Himalayans. Birmans were the original stock for breeding ragdolls, so they look very similar, but they have slightly different markings and personalities. They are fun, social cats that love attention-from their chosen person. They are more of a one-person cat than others.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long and silky coat in seal, blue, red, chocolate, cream, and tortie colors, including standard or lynx pattern points and deep blue eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Oriental Shorthair</h2><p>TaniaVdB / Pixabay</p><p>At a glance, you may think this slender cat looks like a Siamese, but the Oriental shorthair is a separate breed. Unlike Siamese cats, they usually have green eyes and many color patterns and colors. The Oriental can also have long hair. Oriental shorthair cats are prone to skin cancer and getting cold due to their lack of fur; they are often seen wearing sweaters.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat with many color possibilities: solids, shaded, smoke, and tabby with green, blue, gold, and yellow eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Sphynx</h2><p>If you are looking for a cat that doesn't shed, then the sphynx is for you. Sphynx cats look unique due to their lack of fur and are very social, active, dog-like felines. They look like they belong in the laps of royalty, but they are playful and goofy and act more like court jesters despite their regal appearance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Hairless with white, black, red, chocolate, lavender, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, pointed, and mink colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Devon Rex</h2><p>Devon rex cats have wavy, soft short hair and slender bodies with enormous ears. The Devon Rex is a playful, active cat described as ""a monkey in a catsuit."" This kitty will steal your heart with its lively, sweet disposition. They are also trainable and adept at learning tricks.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, fine, wavy coat in solid, tabby, and shaded varieties</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Himalayan</h2><p>Like the Persian, the Himalayan cat is considered a sub-breed in some cat associations and a separate breed in others. Himalayans were bred from crossing Persians and Siamese to achieve their color points. They love attention and affection from their owners, have sweet personalities, and are playful.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Dense undercoat with a long overcoat that comes in pointed colors and patterns in gray, blue, chocolate, lilac, and cream</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 18 years</p>",1263

Technically, this coat color is a dilution of the black coat gene. The diluted gene produces a coat color that is various shades of bluish-gray. Four cat breeds come only in a blue hue, while six other types of cats have the possibility of a blue coat. They can come from many parts of the globe, such as the New World, Europe, and Asia.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Although the blue characteristic is fully dependent on genetics, certain things are consistent among these cats. The blue coat of these cats typically ranges from light ash gray to a steely, dark grey. Some cats with blue coats also carry the gene for green, yellow, or copper-colored eyes. Coat lengths can come in short, medium, and long.</p><p>These 10 cat breeds are the most likely types to have blue coats.</p><h2>Russian Blue</h2><p>The Russian blue only comes in one coat color-an even, uniformly bright blue with no markings, according to the breed standard. The guard hairs of the coat have silver tips, which gives the coat luster and adds to this breed's beauty. The coat is short-haired and plush. All Russian blue cats also have bright green eyes. This cat breed is known for having an affectionate and intelligent nature that makes them a unique companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 15 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Fine-boned with long limbs; triangular head with distinctive green eyes and broad nose; plush double coat in blue-gray</p><h2>Chartreux</h2><p>Chartreux cats are the national cat of France.

The coat color varies from light ash to a deeper shade of slate. They have a unique texture to their medium-length plush double-coated blue fur. They have a dense undercoat, giving them woolly textured fur. Aside from being interesting to touch, the woolly coat provides these cats with some natural protection against chilly or damp weather conditions.

This blue cat certainly seems like it could disappear into the fog of an early morning. An elegant and uniformly blue-gray cat, the Nebelung is often compared to a long-haired Russian blue. These blue cats do resemble the Russian longhair cats that were popular in the late 1800s. Considered a longhair breed, the Nebelung has a medium-length coat that is always blue. Like many other blue cat breeds, the hairs are silver-tipped at the ends. The green eyes of this breed bring striking contrast to the soft, shimmery coat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 15 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long body, soft double coat with medium-long fur and a plumed tail; eyes are green or yellow-green</p><h2>Korat</h2><p>The Korat is a dark blue cat breed, described by Thai natives in its homeland as rain-cloud gray&rdquo; with a seafoam&rdquo; effect on its silver-tipped coat.

Their iconic blue fur and copper eyes earn them a spot as a top blue cat breed. The British shorthair's coat is short, dense, and thick. Its blue coat color varies in shade but is typically light to medium blue and stays uniform.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 17 pounds (males); 7 to 12 pounds (females)</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Round face and body with males having heavy jowls; short but dense coat in both solid shades including white, blue, and black along with tabby, calico, shaded or bi-color variations</p><h2>Oriental Shorthair</h2><p>The Oriental shorthair sports a coat in many colors and patterns, so this is not an exclusively blue cat breed. However, when the Oriental has a blue coat it is among the most striking looks for this breed. A solid blue Oriental looks svelte and elegant with its long legs and almond-shaped eyes. The blue coat can be a soft bluish-gray or increase in shade intensity to a deeper slate grey.

Larger cat breeds tip the scales at 15 pounds (or more), while the smallest members of the feline family often weigh 5 to 10 pounds.

A premium cat food can save you money. Many cheap foods add fillers that don't have all the nutrients a cat needs in a single serving. Felines eat until they get all their nutrients sometimes eating twice as much of a cheaper food (also fattening on fillers in the process).

While these cats are relatively long in length, they are lean and muscular and typically only weigh 8 to 12 pounds. Females, in particular, stay small and often weigh 8 pounds or less. Though they may be small, this vocal cat breed will make its presence and preferences known.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long body with fine to medium bone structure; short coat in colors like seal, blue, lilac, and chocolate with colorpoints around the face, ears, paws, and tail</p><h2>Burmese</h2><p>Burmese cats are smaller than average with a compact, stocky body and big brain.

While some felines couldn't care less about their owners, others love social interaction with their favorite humans. There are plenty of affectionate cat breeds that, despite often having high social needs, show tons of love and attention to their owners.</p><p>Here are 10 affectionate cat breeds for those who want a day-and-night cuddler.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Affectionate cats have some traits in common. They tend to be more social and friendly-not scaredy cats. They are often mellow and docile, not wound up and anxious. These cats may also communicate their affection with vocalizations like mewing, purring, murmuring, and trills-all forms of contentment or playfulness. These empathic kitties may also sense when you've had a rough day and might purposefully snuggle up or land in your lap to help you unwind with some endorphin-releasing cuddles.</p><h2>Ragdoll</h2><p>Bred to be affectionate companions, ragdoll cats are ideal if you're looking for a lovable and relatively low-maintenance animal. Ragdolls are known to follow their humans from room to room, greet them after a long day out of the house, and even play games like fetch. Ragdoll cats are friendly around children and other pets, making them great family pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, silky plush coat; light-colored body with a darker face, legs, tail, and ears; coat patterns include bi-color, van, mitted, and colorpoint; coat colors include seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, and cream; blue eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Scottish Fold</h2><p>With this breed, it's all about the ears. A random mutation happened naturally as the breed emerged-these cats developed a gene that caused their ears to fold forward. Cat lovers recognized the cats for their unique look, and breeders began breeding these cats specifically for their folds. However, their ears aren't the only special thing about them. Scottish folds are affectionate and social and don't like being left alone. So if you're out of the house a lot, this may not be the breed for you. But if you have extra time to spare for your cat, you might have found your match.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 5 to 11 pounds</p><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Bred to have a white coat but can be seen in a variety of colors, commonly calico, tortoiseshell, and tabby patterns; can have short or relatively long hair</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 14 years</p><h2>Sphynx</h2><p>Because sphynx cats have no hair, they are often cold and need a source of heat to keep them comfortable. Sphynxes are bright, extroverted cats that love humans both for interaction and their warmth. This neat synergistic relationship gives these cats something they need while their humans reap the cuddly benefits. Some people say that owning a sphynx is like owning a living, breathing hot water bottle. They'll cuddle with you beneath the covers at night and perch on your lap during the day.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Hairless; colors include white, black, red, chocolate, lavender, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, pointed, and mink</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 15 years</p><h2>Maine Coon</h2><p>Maine coons are native to America. Their history is mysterious; some believe their history dates back to cats traveling with Viking explorers. Others think these big kitties are a mix between a cat with a raccoon, though that is biologically impossible. These social cats are affectionate towards people of all ages, and they love being involved in all family happenings, whether that means lounging on the couch or sitting at the table for dinner. Besides their affectionate personalities, Maine coons are great hunters and highly intelligent.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 17 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, double coat with more than 75 color combinations and green, gold, or copper eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 15 years</p><h2>Persian</h2><p>Persians are one of the most popular cat breeds in North America. They look beautiful with their long, flowy coats and have a calm, affectionate temperament. Persians are not very energetic. They are happy lounging on the couch and achieve contentment getting ear scratches and gentle hand contact by their humans.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long coat in solid (white, black, cream), tabby, calico, bi-color, silver and gold, shaded, and smoke</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Siamese</h2><p>If you decide to bring a Siamese cat into your life, prepare to have long conversations with your vocal kitty. This breed is exceptionally social. Siamese cats have a distinctive masked look and striking pale blue eyes. Throughout history, their looks and affectionate personalities led to their popularity among cat lovers across the world.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat in seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac with blue eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 12 years</p><h2>Bombay</h2><p>This breed is still relatively rare in North America, but it has a dedicated following. Bombay owners love the fact that these cats are so loving and people-oriented. Their sleek, black coat and stunning copper eyes also make them stand out among some other breeds. Once you meet a clever, cute, and cuddly Bombay, you'll be hooked.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 11 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, sleek coat, usually solid black coat; large, copper eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Tonkinese</h2><p>Breeders wanted to create a loving, affectionate cat breed that was intelligent and less vocal than the Siamese cat. The Tonkinese resulted from crossing the Siamese and Burmese breeds for the best characteristics of both. Affectionately called Tonks, these cats love their humans. They are known for being friendly, active, and exceptionally affectionate. They love attention and will demand it.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coat can be seal, blue, lilac, and chocolate with points around the face, ears, paws, and tail</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 18 years</p><h2>American Shorthair</h2><p>When you say housecat&rdquo; in the U.S., you're likely talking about an American shorthair. They are extremely common pets in North America, primarily due to their affectionate personality and distinct coats that come in a wide variety of colors. American shorthairs are exceptionally adaptable, making them great pets for families with growing kids or those who are routinely on the move. American shorthairs love attention and love to be held, but they do not demand it, unlike other breeds. They are always happy to lay perched in the sun when you don't have time to give them love.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Shorthaired coat with a wide variety of color possibilities, including white, black, cream, blue, brown, chinchilla, tortoiseshell, cameo, and many more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Birman</h2><p>Birman cats are stunning. While showing off piercing blue eyes and a long silky coat, Birmans also exude elegance. Like the American shorthair, this breed loves to be around people and is highly adaptable to any type of home. Birmans are friendly with anyone and everything, including other pets. They like to play with any companions, no matter their breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long and silky coat in seal, blue, red, chocolate, cream, and tortie colors, including standard or lynx pattern points and deep blue eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>Cats that tend to be less affectionate are more independent-minded or task-oriented, like the Norwegian forest cat; the curly LaPerm breed descended from barn cats; and the active climber, the Abyssinian. Other breeds to avoid are cats that have had very little to no socialization with humans.</p>",1250

Tuxedo refers to the distinctive coat markings that look like they are wearing a formal dinner suit. Mixed-breed domestic cats, also called moggies, can have black and white markings as well.</p><p>Here are 10 popular types of cats that can have a black and white coat, among other potential coat colors and markings.</p><h3></h3><h2>Maine Coon</h2><p>The Maine coon is one of the largest cat breeds and is known for being incredibly gentle. Combined with their distinctive good looks and lustrous coat, they are among the most popular breeds across the world. Maine coons are commonly tabby, but they come in various coat colors and patterns, including black and white. These cats usually get along well with all family members, including respectful kids and dogs. They're loyal, affectionate and very intelligent. Maine coons are known for being expert mousers and might not suit a family with small pet furries.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 17 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, double coat with more than 75 color combinations and green, gold, or copper eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 15 years</p><h2>Cornish Rex</h2><p>A black and white Cornish Rex is striking to behold with its famed tight, curly rows of fur; wide-set large ears; and svelte physique. They're sometimes referred to as the greyhound of the cat kingdom. Energetic and sociable, this breed thrives with company. The Cornish Rex is an intelligent cat that you can teach an array of impressive tricks, and some provide support as therapy animals.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Tight, curly short hair in a wide range of colors, including solid, shaded, smoke, and tabby</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 16 years</p><h2>Manx Cat</h2><p>Like the Cornish Rex, the Manx is dog-like. They're usually playful, companionable, even-tempered, and energetic. Manx cats are also smart and highly trainable. The breed standard is for these cats to have no tails, but cats that are not used for showing or breeding may have a short stump of a tail. They come in a wide variety of coat colors, including black and white. They come in both longhaired and shorthaired varieties, both of which have thick double coats. These cats are also famed for their skills as mousers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Coat and Colors: Short- and long-haired varieties; tailless; colors include white, blue, black, red, cream, silver, tortoiseshell, blue cream, and brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 16 years</p><h2>Munchkin</h2><p>This breed gets its name from its shorter than average legs, which occur due to a genetic mutation. Munchkins come in a vast array of color combinations, including black and white. These diminutive kitties are known for being warm-hearted, fun-loving, and outgoing. Because of their short legs, Munchkins can need extra help when it comes to grooming those harder-to-reach spots. Debate swirls around the ethics of continued breeding of this cat as its shortened legs are often accompanied by health problems including a curved spine and severe arthritis. The breed is not recognized by many pedigree cat groups due to these concerns over their health.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 6 to 9 pounds</p><p>Height: 5 to 7 inches</p><p>Coat and Colors: Shorthaired with a medium-length plush coat or longhaired with a semi-long silky coat; coats come in any color combination or pattern</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Oriental Shorthair</h2><p>Often confused with their Siamese relative, the Oriental shorthair is a separate breed. Unlike Siamese, these cats have green eyes and come in many patterns and colors, including black and white. Like Siamese, the Oriental shorthair tends to be inquisitive, chatty, and even-tempered. They have a short, single coat, meaning these cats can feel the cold and prefer a cozy and draft-free home. A longer-haired Oriental is a separate breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat with many color possibilities: solids, shaded, smoke, and tabby; green, blue, gold, and yellow eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Persian</h2><p>While the pure white Persian is often the most photographed and highly prized variety of this popular breed, they also come in other colors, including black and white. There's no mistaking this breed with their long, thick coats; large, vivid eyes; and smushed faces. Their popularity also stems from their laid-back, low-energy, and snuggly personalities. They aren't known for being one of the most intelligent or most trainable cats. A Persian's long, lustrous coat requires daily grooming. It easily gets matted and is uncomfortable if neglected.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long coat in solid (white, black, cream), tabby, calico, bi-color, silver and gold, shaded, and smoke</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Scottish Fold</h2><p>Famed for their small folded-over ears, the Scottish fold has a rather impish-looking appearance. These cats are usually anything but impish in personality. Known for being laid back and friendly, Scottish folds usually live well alongside other pets and respectful kids. The same mutation that causes the ears to fold can also cause degenerative joint disease that can impact cartilage and bone development, leading to painful arthritis. Their dense coat needs regular grooming to prevent problems with matted fur and hairballs. The black and white combination is just one of many colors that the breed can have.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 5 to 11 pounds</p><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coats that can come in many colors and patterns, but commonly calico, tortoiseshell, and tabby</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 14 years</p><h2>Siberian Cat</h2><p>Siberian cats have a very dense, semi-longhaired, triple coat. They need this fur to survive the freezing, forested subarctic Siberian regions of Russia. The breed is growing in popularity in the U.S. due to its affectionate, playful personality and striking good looks. Siberians are active and intelligent and need enrichment to prevent boredom. Their coat is not prone to matting but they do shed a lot. Brown tabby is the Siberian's most common pattern, although they come in a wide range of colors and patterns, including black and white.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Semi-longhaired, triple-coat that varies from coarse to soft; comes in a wide variety of colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 18 years</p><h2>Turkish Angora</h2><p>The elegant, long-haired Turkish Angora was once associated with only being white. They're most commonly still found in this color and come in many other variations, including black and white. Turkish Angoras tend to be best suited to a household where they'll have company for most of the day. Outgoing and affectionate, they need plenty of attention and enrichment. They're more active than your average cat and can become mischievous if they get bored. Unlike most cats, this breed often loves to swim and play in the water.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Height: 9 to 14 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, silky coats that can come in a variety of colors and patterns, like white with lavender, chocolate, or Himalayan markings, tabby or calico</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 years or more</p><h2>Domestic Mixed Breed Cat (Moggies)</h2><p>Domestic mixed-breed cats are also called moggies and don't have any formal pedigree. If you're looking to adopt a cat, these cats are most commonly found in rescue shelters across the country. They are beautiful, intelligent, and affectionate with wonderful temperaments and minimal health issues. They come in a wide variety of coat colors and patterns, including black and white.</p>",1226

There's no guarantee that your cat will live into its 20s, as nature and nurture both are determining factors. But picking a cat breed with a longer lifespan and taking great care of your cat improves your odds of having a loving feline for many years.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Since the cat's diet is such an important factor for longevity, choosing a higher quality food from the beginning can set up your kitty for a longer lifespan. The cat food label should say ""Complete and Balanced"" on it. In the list of ingredients, make sure the protein source comes first on the ingredient list and is named, such as ""chicken, turkey, lamb, or beef,"" rather than ""meat.""</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Quality nutrition, adequate exercise, and regular wellness checks will maximize a cat's lifespan. There aren't breed-specific characteristics about one breed or another that make them longer-living cats. Some breeds may have a higher prevalence for disease or health concerns, which could shorten a cat's life. Quite the opposite, mixed breeds could have a greater chance of longevity for broadening the gene pool.</p><p>However, all experts agree that the No. 1 commonality that all long-lived cats have is they are indoor cats.

The breed's average lifespan is around 12 to 20 years.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Wedge-shaped head; slender body; blue eyes</p><h2>Russian Blue</h2><p>The Russian blue is a quiet and rather reserved cat that tends to be affectionate with its family but not clingy.

Being hairless means these cats often need to wear something to keep warm in cool weather. And you need to bathe them usually to remove excess oil on their skin. The breed is prone to heart disease, neurological issues, and skin conditions. But it still has an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Hairless; wrinkled head; lean build</p><h3>Breeds to Avoid</h3><p>Some cat breeds fall slightly short of the average cat lifespan of 15 years. For instance, Manx cats only live around eight to 14 years on average, and Singapura cats live around nine to 15 years. Munchkin cats have an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years.</p><p>While there are many claims about this, the Guinness Book of World Records names the oldest cat as a 38-year-old Texas cat named Creme Puff.</p><p>Yes! While most cats have a shorter lifespan in the 15-year range many cats do live to be 20.</p><p>It's a toss-up among several breeds, but Sphinx cats seem to have shorter lifespans, ranging from 8 to 14 years.<br/></p>",1153

If you're a cat enthusiast, you likely know about Persians, American shorthairs, and Siamese, which are some of the typical cat breeds kept as pets by aficionados. But even then, purebred cats make up only a tiny percentage of the cats in the U.S. So, when it comes to rare cat breeds they are hard to find, often in limited supply, and involve long waitlists with breeders or a cattery.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Each breed has unique characteristics, which could make them your perfect pet or cause you to steer clear. More than looks or breed affinity, it's more essential to find the cat that matches your lifestyle and personality.</p><p>Here are 10 of the rarest cats around.</p><h2>Scottish Fold</h2><p>Named after their cute folded ears, Scottish Fold cats have a unique look. The folds are produced by a gene that affects ear cartilage, but because the gene isn't completely dominant, not all Scottish folds have folded ears. Either way, these cats are adorable. The original Scottish fold was a barn cat in Scotland that was bred for its distinct folded ears throughout the United Kingdom in the 1960s. Now, they're popular pets among celebrities across the globe, including American singer Taylor Swift. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-sized body; small ears that fold forward and downward; medium coat</p><h2>Norwegian Forest Cat</h2><p>The name gives away the origins of the Norwegian forest cat breed. Called the skogkatt in Norway, it is a natural European breed descended from domestic cats first introduced by the ancient Romans. Norse myths suggest the cats were in Norway for hundreds of years. The Norwegian forest cat started to gain popularity in the U.S. in the 1980s. Americans fell in love with the cats for their playful personalities and natural athleticism.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 20 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long, double coat in multiple colors; larger size; almond-shaped eyes</p><h2>Sphynx</h2><p>The sphynx breed is easily identified by its distinct physical features giant ears and hairless body. These cats are excellent pets for those who suffer from severe allergies. Because they have no hair, these felines are almost always cold, meaning they are almost always looking for snuggles. Hairless cats have been recorded throughout history, including ancient Egypt. The current American sphynx breed descended from cats in Minnesota and Canada that had natural mutations preventing hair growth. While there are some other hairless breeds, the sphynx breed is unique for being exceptionally social. Sphynxes love their owners and are affectionate and playful.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Hairless; variable skin color; angular head</p><h2>Egyptian Mau</h2><p>As the only natural domesticated breed of spotted cat, the Egyptian mau is often sought for its stunning coat. But besides their ravishing good looks, these cats are also known for their quality companionship and hunting prowess. First thought to be pets of the ancient Egyptians thousands of years ago, Egyptian maus may be one of the oldest domestic cat breeds. Maus were brought into the U.S. in the 1980s when they captured the hearts of cat lovers across the nation.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 9 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Athletic body; natural spotted coat; medium-sized; rounded head</p><h2>Korat</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular body; short blue-grey coat; heart-shaped face; luminous green eyes</p><h2>British Shorthair</h2><p>If you're looking for a goofy or mischievous feline companion, then the British shorthair may be for you. Instead, their personality is quiet, calm, and generally reserved. British shorthair cats are native to Great Britain, though they may have been an import when the Romans invaded the country in the first century A.D. British shorthairs are also known as British blue cats due to their blue-grey coats. The American Cat Association recognized them in 1967. It's a relatively uncommon breed, but they are known to be top-notch companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 17 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short and dense coat; colors include white, black, red, cream, blue, and more; rounded features</p><h2>Peterbald</h2><p> </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 14 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long and slender body; hairless; large, pointed ears; triangle-shaped heads</p><h2>Minskin</h2><p>Cross a munchkin cat with a sphynx, and you've got a minskin. Minskins get their short, squat bodies from the munchkin and their extremely sparse coats from the sphynx giving you a distinct-looking cat. The first official minskin came from Boston, Massachusetts, in 2000. After five years, the minskin pool had grown to about 50 cats, and the breed was registered by The International Cat Association (TICA). The adorable and outgoing breed is part of a TICA program that monitors the development of new breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 6 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small body; short legs; nearly hairless with sparse hair around extremities only; rounded head</p><h2>American Bobtail</h2><p>Despite the American bobtail cat's physical similarities to wild bobcats, these felines are fully domesticated and make wonderful pets. This unique breed can be difficult to find. The American bobtail has been in North America since the 1960s, but it didn't gain popularity until the 2000s. The original bobtail was a cat found at a motel in Arizona, and experts believe it was abandoned there. The cat may be a cross between a bobcat and a domestic house cat due to his feral appearance and distinct bobtail.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 16 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short, bobbed tails; almond-shaped eyes; come in any color or pattern; variable coat length</p><h2>LaPerm</h2><p>LaPerms are named for their curly or wavy fur that comes in a variety of colors and patterns. The coat can have tight ringlets or long corkscrew curls. The LaPerm was a spontaneous genetic mutation in a regular litter of tabby farm cats in the 1980s in Oregon. In the 1990s, the Cat Fancy Association suggested starting a breeding program for this unique and rarely seen quality in a cat's coat. By 2008, the breed achieved CFA champion status.</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>The most common cat owned by Americans is the domestic shorthair, in other words, a mixed-breed house cat. You'll likely want to avoid going to an animal rescue if what you want is a purebred kitty. The animal shelters are usually full of mixed-breed ""moggies,"" as the British affectionately call them.</p><p>If rare is what you're after, you'd be good with any purebred cat, including the more popular ragdoll, Persian, or Siamese. It is estimated between 70 to 90 million cats are owned by Americans, and of that number, less than 10 percent are pedigreed or purebred felines.</p>",1062

Hybrid cat breeds are created when a domestic cat is bred with an undomesticated or wild cat breed.</p><p>This breeding may be done in an attempt to get more wild patterns, colors, and other physical features, or to combine favorite personality traits and other attributes of domestic and wild cats.</p><h3>Tips</h3><p>While hybrid-cats often look like domestic cats, many early generations can have very wild personality traits that may make them more of a challenge to care for when compared to domestic house cats.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Some hybrid cat breeds are more mischevious and active than others but they all can have very wild instincts. First, second, and sometimes even third generations of hybrid cats will have more of these wild traits than later generations so pet owners that are interested in getting a hybrid cat breed should be aware of this. More mental and physical enrichment will be required for these earlier generations.<br/><br/>Here are seven hybrid cat breeds that have grown in popularity over the years.<br/></p><h2>Bengal Cat</h2><p>Bengal cats, not to be confused with Bengal tigers, are a hybrid cat breed that has combined the Asian leopard cat with various domestic cats, especially the Egyptian mau.

The cheetoh is not as common as the Bengal or Savannah but is growing in popularity due to its striking markings.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 12-18 inches</p><p>Weight: 12-25 lbs.</p><p>Coat and Color: Short hair, multiple colors with spots.</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10-15 years</p><h2>Toyger</h2><p>If you're after stripes without having a pet tiger than a toyger may be what you're looking for. Developed by crossing a Bengal cat with a domestic tabby cat, this breed is friendly and highly trainable. Like many other purebred cats, toygers can be prone to developing heart disease but are very playful and make great house cats even though they are not as common as Bengals.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9-13 inches</p><p>Weight: 7-15 lbs.</p><p>Coat and Color: Short hair, brown to orange with black stripes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10-15 years</p><h2>Pixie-Bob</h2><p>Generally agreed to be a cross between a bobcat and a domestic cat, pixie-bobs are thought to be the only pet hybrid cat that may have naturally occurred. Like bobcats, pixie-bobs have a bobbed or shorter tail and ear tufts. They make chirping noises and usually have polydactyl toes.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9-13 inches</p><p>Weight: 8-17 lbs.</p><p>Coat and Color: Often short-haired but can have long hair, brown, red, or rust color with spotting</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13-15 years</p><p>Many hybrid cat breeds are recognized as domesticated cats but like other purebred cats, each breed is known for its own unique features. Researching any breed of cat before committing to caring for it is important for any cat owner, regardles of whether or not you are considering a hybrid.<br/></p><p>Hybrid cats are often more challenging to own than domestic cats, because they are crossed with wild cats. This increases the chance that they will be more difficult than a domestic cat.</p><p>Hybrid cats are banned because they are more dangerous than domestic cats, and can harm humans--especially children and the elderly.</p><p>The regal Savannah cat is the largest hybrid house-cat; its average weight is 15 to 20 pounds.</p>",902
77,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-breed-is-my-cat-554697,Cats > Cat Breeds,<h1>Is Your Cat a Pure Breed?</h1>,"<h1>Is Your Cat a Pure Breed?</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Most cat breed standards allow for several different eye and fur color or coat patterns within the physical appearance descriptions. This can make it difficult if you are trying to determine what kind of cat you have by reading what colors and patterns each breed of cat can come in. Just because you have a black cat with golden eyes does not mean you have a Bombay, nor does your large longhair tabby automatically become a Maine Coon since you read Maine Coons can come in that pattern. Domestic house cats can also come in almost every color and pattern with varying lengths of fur and are referred to simply as mixed breed cats.</p><h2>Domestic and Purebred Cat Differences</h2><p>Most house cats are simply considered to be domestic short-haired, domestic medium-haired, or domestic long-haired cats and are not pure breeds. But that doesn't mean you'll never come across a purebred cat or that your cat can't be a pure breed.</p><p>A purebred is defined by The Cat Fanciers Glossary as ""a cat whose ancestors are all of the same breed, or whose ancestry includes crossbreeding that is allowed in the breed standard. For example, a purebred Bombay may also have Burmese cats in its background."" Generally, a cat's pedigree must be certified by the cat breed registry before it can rightfully be called a purebred.</p><p>The American shorthair cat breed was originally called the domestic shorthair breed, but the name was changed to avoid confusion among cats with an unknown history, among other reasons. Lacking the necessary pedigree, a domestic shorthair cat cannot simply be referred to as an American shorthair cat, despite looking like one, unless the breeding history is known.</p><h2>Domestic Cats</h2><p>Domestic cats are rich in history, and there is no one-size-fits-all description of them. Domestic cats can be large, small, fat, or thin depending on their genetics, diet and the care they receive. Their colors and coat patterns are numerous and include black, white, gray, orange and all the shades in between. Coat patterns include tabby, calico, tortoiseshell, and tuxedo, to name a few.</p><p>Far from being just ordinary house cats, domestic cats are the most commonly found type of cats in the world, and they may have an unknown pedigree filled with various breeds of different colors and patterns. While not technically different breeds, cats of different coat patterns and colors tend to have characteristics that make them unique and are often referred to by these colors and patterns.</p><h3>Calico Cats</h3><p>Calico cats, also known as tortoiseshell-and-white cats, comprise a garden of cat colors, either vibrant orange (technically known as ""red""), white and black, or more subdued flaxen, blue-gray, and white. In feline genetics, the latter is known as ""dilute calico."" The various patterns of the calico patches are almost as variable as snowflakes since you'll never see two exactly alike. Calicos are almost always females, and the rare male is typically sterile.</p><p>Pure breed cats that can come in a calico pattern include the Persian, Manx, Maine Coon, and Scottish Fold, among others.</p><h3>Tabby Cats</h3><p>If domestic cats are the most favored of all, tabby cats are the most popular of the cat color patterns. Tabbies come in stripes, whorls, swirls, dots, and dashes, and are also allowed in the breed standards of over two dozen recognized cat breeds. Their colors range from red to cream, to black, blue, silver, brown, and tan. One of the most consistent markings of tabby cats is the magnificent ""M"" centered on their foreheads just above their eyes. </p><h3>Tortoiseshell Cats</h3><p>Tortoiseshell cats, also known as torties, are two colors, red and black, along with dilutions of those colors. These dilutions are lighter shades of red (creams), and lighter shades of black (blues, pale grays), and browns. Tortoiseshells also come in two types of color patterns, brindled or woven and patched. To make it even more complex, tortoiseshells may also have patches that are tabby patterned. If you aren't sure if you have a tortoiseshell or a calico cat, remember that if your cat has white on them, then they are considered a calico.</p><p>Pure breed cats that can be tortoiseshells include the Cornish Rex and Japanese Bobtail breeds.</p><h3>Tuxedo Cats</h3><p>This coloration of cats is exactly like it sounds, black and white. Tuxedo cats are primarily black with white markings on their chest, feet, legs, and face. Tuxedo cats can be domestic or pure breeds such as the Devon Rex, Maine Coon, Persian, Cornish Rex, Manx, and others.</p><h2>Unique Cat Breeds</h2><p>Some pure breeds of cats have unique features that help differentiate them from other breeds and domestic cats. The lack of fur, wavy fur texture, smashed-in faces, folded ears, and other attributes are found naturally in some cat breeds. Domestic cats typically all look the same, if you can look past their fur lengths, colors, and patterns. They have similar body builds, head shapes and ears. In contrast, many pure breed cats, if lined up side by side, look very different from one another.</p><h3>Watch Now: What Is Your Cat Saying to You?</h3>",831
78,https://www.thesprucepets.com/caring-for-hairless-cat-4776345,Cats > Cat Breeds > Hairless Cat Breeds,<h1>How to Care for a Hairless Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Hairless Cat</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Hairless cats have been popular for decades. This in part to their friendly, sociable, almost dog-like at times demeanor. However, whichever breed of hairless cat your have your heart set on, there are things you should know about their care before you launch headlong into hairless cat ownership. A life without fur can require more upkeep than one might initially think.</p><h2>Keeping Your Hairless Cat's Skin Healthy</h2><p>Just like people, cat's produce oils in their skin. A hairless cat is not able to wick these oils away from the skin like a furred cat would be able to do. As a result, your hairless cat will accumulate these oils on their skin. To help clean these oils off, hairless cats require weekly baths with warm water and an over-the-counter, hypoallergenic pet shampoo that is free of dyes and perfumes. When bathing, it is important to ensure that all the shampoo is thoroughly rinsed off of your cat, as any residual shampoo left on the skin for an extended period may cause irritation.</p><p>It is equally important to ensure that your cat is sufficiently dried after bath time so that they don't get too cold. A simple, gentle pat-down with a towel should do the trick. When not bathed routinely (and sometimes even if you have a bath schedule set) hairless cats can get acne and blackhead breakouts just like people. If your cat have a breakout, you can clean the area with warm water and mild antibacterial soap. If that doesn't help, a trip to the vet to help get the breakout in check might be in order.</p><p>Furred cats not only benefit from fur wicking away the natural oils in their skin, but the fur in the ears also wicks away dirt and debris. Without this fur, the ears of a hairless cat can get quite dirty quite quickly. As with routine bathing, routine ear cleaning (something that could be easily done at the same time as a bath) helps prevent ear infections from excess ear debris. To clean your cat's ears, you will need over the counter pet ear cleaner, cotton balls, or cotton rounds. Some tutorials will have your add the cleaner directly into the ear and there is nothing wrong with that method, but most cats aren't very happy about having the cleaner squirted into their ear canal. These cats may be more amenable to you first saturating a cotton ball or cotton round with the ear cleaner and then wiping debris away with the soaked cotton.</p><h2>Keeping Nails Clipped </h2><p>As with any cat, regular nail trimming can help prevent your cat from getting stuck on things like blankets and carpeting as well as preventing painful ingrown nails. For hairless cats, though, keeping nails clipped back is even more important. Without fur as a barrier, a hairless cat with long claws may accidentally scratch open wounds on herself. These open wounds could also easily become infected.</p><p>Getting your cat comfortable with nail clippings, as with ear cleaning, is easier when they are young, but that doesn't mean you can't train your adult cat to allow a nail clipping. If you are still having difficulty, though, you can always take your cat to the vet and have them clip the nails back for you.</p><h2>Keeping Your Hairless Cat Warm</h2><p>During the fall and winter months, make sure that your cat has access to plenty of blankets and cozy cat beds. There are commercially made self-heated cat beds (that also are great for senior kitties with arthritic bones) that keep kitties warm without the risk of causing overheating or thermal burns. You may also choose to dress your hairless cat in clothing, but your cat may need to be slowly introduced to their new wardrobe. Also know that, due to their predisposition for oily skin, your cat's clothes may need to be washed fairly regularly. Hairless cats will seek heat from people, bedding, or sunlight. Without fur, sunbathing results in the skin getting more direct exposure and increases the risk for sunburns. If a hairless cat likes to sunbathe, their time in the sun may need to be limited. </p><p>Fur doesn't just insulate against the cold, though. It can also help regulate a cat's core body temperature in warmer weather. In the spring and summer months, make sure that your hairless cat has plenty of areas where they can cool off, either with air conditioning, fans, or commercially made cooling mats. Additionally, assuming your cat has no dietary restrictions, a popsicle made from freezing a pureed squeeze treat makes a refreshing summertime treat. Remember that hairless cats get chilly easily, so be sure to provide a place for them to get warm even during peak summertime.</p><h2>Hairless Cats Make Great Companions</h2><p>If you put in the effort, hairless cats can make great pets. They are known for being particularly friendly and cuddly. This may be partly due to them seeking a warm place to nap, but most cat lovers likely do not care that their cuddly cat has ulterior motives for their snuggles. </p>",841

Often hairless and cuddly, these cats make for a unique pet. They love human attention and excel at agility and tricks despite their pot-bellied appearance. Sphynxes are loyal, easygoing and great with other pets. Everyone will fall in love with their sense of humor and charming personality.</p><p>Sphynxes appear hairless, which isn't attractive to all pet-lovers. If you don't understand the appeal, these adorable photos are sure to spark your Sphynx obsession.</p><h2>They're Friendly, but Not Furry Felines</h2><p>sphynx.bibi / Instagram</p><p>Sphynx cats are one of the friendliest cat breeds. Their cuddly nature may be explained by their reliance on humans to keep warm. All Sphynxes look hairless, but are usually covered with fine hairs that can't always be seen with the naked eye.</p><h2>Sphynxes Are Colorful Cats</h2><p>leafless_sphynx / Instagram</p><p>Coloring can vary from cat to cat and colors mimic the markings you would find on furrier felines. You can find Sphynx cats in black, white, red, brown, and various multicolor patterns, like calico and tortoiseshell.</p><h2>Agility Is Their Number One Skill</h2><p>Meadowsphynx / Instagram</p><p>They're show-offs. Sphynxes are a high energy breed and love performing acrobatic tricks and climbing into high places. They are curious and mischievous cats who love their owners to no end, constantly demanding their undivided attention.</p><h2>Sunspots Are Everything!</h2><p>dennis_the_sphynx / Instagram</p><p>Cats love napping in the sun and Sphynx cats are no different. Because of their curious nature, Sphynxes do best as indoor cats. Keeping them safe inside will prevent dangerous accidents in the great outdoors. When you're not home, leave a curtain open so they can find a luxurious sunny spot to fall asleep in.</p><h2>Regular Grooming Keeps Them Happy and Healthy</h2><p>Despite their hairless looks, grooming is an important aspect of caring for Sphynx cats. Because their body oil is not absorbed by fur, vets recommend a daily sponge bath to avoid skin problems and oil spots on furniture. Though they love laying in the sun, exposure should be limited to avoid sunburn on thin-haired Sphynxes.</p><h2>Sphynx Cats Love Making Friends</h2><p>Sphynxes are very social cats who crave attention. If you will be away from them often, make sure they have a friend. They get along swimmingly with most pets, including dogs. Consider doubling the fun by adding another Sphynx to your household.</p><h2>Cuddling Is Their Favorite Activity</h2><p>Stroking, holding, and cuddling your Sphynx is an unbeatable bonding experience that both of you will enjoy. If you have a Sphynx, you can expect them to sleep with you under the covers to stay warm. It's like having a living, purring foot warmer!</p><h2>They're Natural Acrobats With Great Balance</h2><p>There's no better way to have fun with your cat than doing tricks! Sphynxes are exceptionally agile and love performing. Teach them to jump through a hoop or stand on their hind legs for fun. Don't forget to reward them with lots of tasty treats.</p><h2>Food Is No Obstacle</h2><p>Ninja_and_michi / Instagram</p><p>Sphynxes sure can eat! These cats are small, but their appetites are big. They often look pot-bellied, but that doesn't mean they're overweight. They have fast metabolisms too, so they need more food than the average feline. Try foods and treats with real meat and healthy veggies for a well-rounded diet.</p><h2>They Were Bred Selectively</h2><p>To obtain the less furry coat and exceptionally sociable personality, breeders carefully bred so-called hairless cats until they found the perfect mix. Now, Sphynx cats are highly sought after and top many lists of affectionate feline breeds.</p><h2>Humor Comes Naturally to Sphynx Cats</h2><p>Sphynx_pet / Instagram</p><p>If their charming looks don't pull you in, their sense of humor will. Their silly antics will have you in tears (of laughter) in no time.</p><h2>Wrinkles Are Just a Part of Life</h2><p>hairless_catstagram / Instagram</p><p>Just like Sphynx cats, furry felines have wrinkles. The difference? They can hide them! Since Sphynx wrinkles are exposed, it's essential to keep them clean and wash them regularly to avoid dirt and oil buildup. Even without fur, their skin and thin hairs are oh so smooth to the touch, so pet away!</p><h2>They're Hollywood Actors</h2><p>One Sphynx cat rose to stardom in the films for his role as Mr. Bigglesworth. The Sphynx was the pet of Dr. Evil, who was often shown stroking him lovingly. He was actually a champion cat named Ted Nude-Gent, a play on the name of American musician Ted Nugent.</p><p>A purebred Sphynx costs between $1500 to $4500.</p><p>To assure your Sphynx has been humanely bred and cared for, please purchase it from a reputable breeder.</p><p>Sphynx cats live from 8 to 14 years.</p><p>Sphynx cats are hairless because of a genetic mutation involving their hair follicles.</p><p>Sphynx Cat Breed Information.</p>",746

Longhaired cats are the result of a genetic mutation, and researchers have narrowed down the gene to the fibroblast growth factor 5 or FGF5, for short.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Here are 12 of the fluffiest, silkiest, and most coifed long-haired cats out there.</p><h2>Maine Coon</h2><p>It's widely believed that Maine coons originated in a climate with harsh winter weather, which would explain their all-natural cold-weather wear. Maine coons have extremely dense, water-resistant hair, giant, tufted paws (which serve as miniature snowshoes to make walking across snowy terrain easier), and massive, bushy tails they can wrap around their bodies for additional warmth.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 9 to 18 pounds</p><p>Length: 36 to 40 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-to-large, broad-chested cat with pointed ears and a long, dense coat that's shorter on the shoulders and stomach; coats can come in more than 75 color variations, but their eyes are usually green, gold, or copper</p><h2>Balinese</h2><p>Balinese cats are known for their striking blue eyes and silky, pointed coats-much like their close relative, the Siamese. The Balinese breed results from the genetic mutation in Siamese that causes cats to develop longer, silky coats. That's good news for cat-loving allergy-sufferers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 6 to 11 pounds</p><p>Length: Typically 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Slender body with a long tail and pointed ears; coats are long and silky, coming in creamy white with pointed colors around the face, ears, tail, and paws</p><h2>Persian</h2><p>Persians are, perhaps, best known for their long, glamorous coats, smushed faces, and vivid eyes. These pretty kitties are loved for more than just their looks. They have charming personalities, too. Born to be cuddlers, Persian cats are very calm, affectionate, and, generally, inactive. Despite their low-maintenance lifestyles, Persians are high-maintenance when it comes to grooming.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: 14 to 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, medium-sized built with a flat face, and round, vivid eyes; long, silky coats that come in solid, bicolor, tabby, calico, and other color variations and patterns</p><h2>Norwegian Forest Cat</h2><p>Also known as a ""Wegie,"" the Norwegian forest cat is a natural breed that can trace its roots back to the Vikings. Like the Maine coon, it's believed that Wegies originated in a cold climate, so they, too, have very dense water-resistant coats. Bathing your Wegie isn't recommended unless their hair is filthy or you must wash it out of medical necessity.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 13 to 20 pounds</p><p>Length: 12 to 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large, sturdy cat with very dense hair, large, padded paws, and a long, bushy tail; coats can come in white, black, red, cream, cinnamon, and tabby</p><h2>Himalayan</h2><p>If you think Himalayan cats look a little bit like a Persian and a little bit like a Siamese, you're 100 percent correct. Himmies are a hybrid of the two popular breeds. The result is a gorgeous cat with the coat and eye colors of a Siamese and the long, silky hair of a Persian. Himalayans are sweet, playful cats, but don't let their laid-back personalities fool you. Their long coats require daily maintenance to prevent mats and tangles.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: About 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-to-large in size with a wide chest, round abdomen, and muscular build; can often look bigger than they actually are; coats come in cream, grey, blue, and chocolate with pointed markings</p><h2>Turkish Angora</h2><p>Originating in Turkey sometime during the 15th century, Turkish Angoras were once considered only white cats with blue or green eyes, and, for many years, all long-haired cats were called Angoras. After many years as the top cat when it came to coat colors and length, it's now accepted that Turkish Angoras can come in a variety of coat colors and patterns and other cats can have similar colored eyes and hair color.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Length: 12 to 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long, slim, and slender bodied with pointed ears and long, silky hair; Turkish Angora's coat can come in numerous color variations and patterns, including white and lilac, chocolate, calico, tabby, and more</p><h2>Birman</h2><p>Although the Birman's coat comes in six colors and two different patterns, they always have white ""mittens"" on all four paws and blue eyes. The history of the Birman cat is largely unknown, but it's believed they're the result of Burmese cats being transported to France and mixed with Siamese cats.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 10 to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: 15 to 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, medium-to-large cat with long, silky hair and pointed markings; coat can come in seal, blue, chocolate, red, cream, and tortoiseshell, with pointed or lynx patterns</p><h2>LaPerm</h2><p>Perhaps best known for its distinctive permed hair appearance, the LaPerm is a relatively newer breed that originated in 1982. It has long, tightly curled hair around the neck, ears, and tail, and a fluffy, bottle-brush shaped tail. The LaPerm's coifed coats resulted from a genetic mutation that caused cats to develop curly hair. These curly-haired kitties were then propagated by breeders.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: 12 to 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium sized with a sturdy build and tightly curled hair around the neck, ears, and tail; it can come in all colors and patterns, but are commonly seen in tortoiseshell, calico, and tabby</p><h2>Somali</h2><p>The Somali is a long-haired version of the Abyssinian. This breed was most likely developed by breeders introducing long-haired breeds into their programs during World War II. Abyssinian populations dwindled, so introducing long-haired cats may have been their attempt at boosting numbers. Somali cats weren't considered a distinctive breed until the 1960s and 1970s.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Length: 15 to 18 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, medium-sized cat with pointed ears and a narrow, Persian-like face; can come in a variety of colors and patterns, including brown, red, cinnamon, blue, and grey, among others</p><h2>Scottish Fold</h2><p>The Scottish fold's most distinctive feature-its folded, flat ears-results from a genetic mutation that has been continuously bred into this breed. The mutation causes flexible cartilage, leading to serious health issues, including arthritis, tail issues, and problems with knees and ankles. It's often recommended that a Scottish fold is bred with a British shorthair to maintain its appearance but strengthen the gene pool.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 5 to 11 pounds</p><p>Length: 10 to 30 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-sized cat with a round head, and folded, flat ears; coats can come in many colors and patterns, but commonly calico, tortoiseshell, and tabby</p><h2>Ragdoll</h2><p>The ragdoll has a silky single coat of medium-to-long length. It lacks an underlayer of fur similar to Balinese cats. It's meant to be lower-matting. This breed still requires brushing at least twice a week to avoid matting. Some people with allergies may be less bothered by this breed since this cat doesn't have an undercoat and shed dander.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 10 to 20 pounds</p><p>Length: 17 to 21 inches long</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-to-long length coat; many different patterns; blue eye color</p><h2>Siberian</h2><p>The Siberian cat is a forest cat native to snowy Russia, where it needed its luxurious triple coat to protect it against cold. The triple coat comprises three layers: a shorter, dense undercoat of downy hair, a layer of slightly longer awn hair&rdquo; in the middle, and an even longer outer coat layer or guard hairs. The Siberian cat's coat may come in any color or pattern. In warm weather, the Siberian cat will shed the heavy coat in favor of a shorter, thinner summer coat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 10 to 20 pounds</p><p>Length: 17 to 25 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Coat varies from coarse to soft; moderately long to longhaired triple coat with a full collar ruff; colors can come in any combination or pattern; all eye colors</p>",1266

Most cats are curious, but larger cats may have an advantage when it comes to their jumping abilities and can get into a little more trouble with their longer reach. Some of the large breed felines are athletic and active. Many bond strongly with their human owners and have their own unique ways to vocalize with mews, squeaks, and purrs when they need you.</p><h2>Maine Coon</h2><p>The strong, shaggy Maine coon is a well-proportioned large domesticated cat. There are many stories of how this breed developed. Some believe they originated in America as a cross between a house cat and a raccoon, although that myth has been scientifically debunked. That raccoon myth was one explanation for the Maine coon's long, smooth coat and voluminous tail. This unique and affectionate breed is a great family pet known for being a gentle giant in the domesticated cat world.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 16 inches<br />Weight: 10 to 18 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Long, double coat with more than 75 color combinations and green, gold, or copper eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 15 years</p><h2>Ragdoll</h2><p>The ragdoll earned its name because of its docile, cuddly, and affectionate nature.

This long-haired cat has a round, often flat face and a distinctly short muzzle, giving it a squished face look. Its long hair gives it a larger appearance. In actuality, it is one of the smallest of the larger breeds. Unlike most larger cats, this cat is content lounging around all day and is not as active as some other breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches<br />Weight: 7 to 12 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Long coat in solid (white, black, cream), tabby, calico, bicolor, silver and gold, shaded, and smoke</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Chausie</h2><p>An exotic-looking breed, the Chausie is a large, extremely active, and intelligent cat. The Chausie got its name from the Latin name felis chaus,&rdquo; meaning jungle cat.&rdquo; People likely gave it this name because of its natural hunting skills and regal demeanor combined with its large-and-in-charge appearance.

Its exotic, leopard-like appearance makes the Savannah a commonly desired pet among big cat enthusiasts. Savannah cats are classified by the amount of each breed they contain to inform owners of how genuinely wild they are. For example, F1 and F2 generations are usually the largest and have more genes from the African serval as these are the first and second generations of breeding directly between a wild serval and a domestic cat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 17 inches<br />Weight: 12 to 25 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Short to medium length coat; black, brown spotted tabby, black silver spotted tabby, and black smoke with a solid or tabby pattern</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 20 years</p><h2>American Bobtail</h2><p>A distinctly short, stubby bobbed tail is what makes this domesticated house cat stand apart from all of the other breeds.

Resulting from a naturally occurring genetic mutation, these cat breeds don't have the long, expressive tail of most domesticated cats. Instead, they either have some or none of that full tail length. What little tails they do have may be straight, kinked, or bent. And some are extra fluffy. Besides the tail, these cat breeds range in appearance, size, and personality.</p><p>Learn more about 10 of the most captivating bobtail cat breeds.</p><h3>What is a bobtail cat?</h3><p>Bobtail cats are a unique breed of domesticated cats that get their unusual name thanks to their nub-like tail. It's the result of a genetic mutation and is about one-third the length of a normal cat's tail.</p><h2>Japanese Bobtail</h2><p>Sporting a bunny-like tail that's often called a ""pom,"" the Japanese bobtail is a fairly small cat breed with a tail that is straight or bent. As its name suggests, this breed is closely associated with Japan, though it also might have originated in other parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Tibet. These cats tend to have affectionate and playful personalities.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium length coat; comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns, including white, black, cream, lilac, red, blue, bicolor, and tricolor</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 18 years</p><h2>American Bobtail</h2><p>The American bobtail breed was developed in the 1960s. A couple adopted a stray cat with a short tail and bred him to their female cat with a typical long tail. The resulting kittens had a distinctive short tail, and the trait was selectively bred for in future generations. American bobtails are generally sweet and playful with their families. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 16 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short to long coat that is typically shaggy; comes in many colors and patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Pixie-Bob</h2><p>With the appearance of a miniature bobcat, the pixie-bob is one of the most wild-looking bobtail cat breeds but rest assured this domesticated cat is an easygoing and affectionate feline friend. Pixie-bob tails can range in length from nonexistent, to a few inches, to a full tail. Another interesting feature is that many are polydactyl, meaning their paws have extra toes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 22 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short to shaggy coat; comes in many colors and patterns including stripes and spots</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Manx</h2><p>Some Manx cats have no tails, while others have very short tails. A Manx with no tail is referred to as a ""grumpy,"" while a Manx with some tail bone protrusion is called a ""rumpy riser."" Regardless of which category a Manx falls into, these cats have a stocky, athletic build with a short back. They're known to be powerful jumpers and an active member of the family.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense coat; comes in a variety of colors and patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 14 years</p><h2>Kurilian Bobtail</h2><p>This bobtail cat breed lived for centuries on the Kuril Islands between Siberia and Japan. Its bobbed tail is a naturally occurring trait and can range in length. In fact, no Kurilian bobtail cats have tails that look exactly alike. These cats are quite muscular, and they love to play. They also are intelligent and social, and typically get along well with people and other pets. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Soft, silky, short or semi-long coat; colors and patterns include red, gray, tabby, bobcat stripes, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Cymric</h2><p>The Cymric is essentially a longhaired version of the Manx. Some but not all breed registries recognize it as a separate cat breed. Cymric cats have a dense double coat and typically lack a tail altogether, though some are born with a bobbed tail or even a full-length tail. A litter may include both Manx (shorthaired) and Cymric (longhaired) kittens because cats can carry the genes to produce either coat type.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium to long fur; comes in many colors and patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 14 years</p><h2>Highlander</h2><p>The highlander is a new type of cat, originating in 2004 from a cross between a desert lynx and jungle curl, two hybrid cat breeds. It used to be known as the highland lynx. These cats have a wild look, but they are typically gentle and loving. They have a naturally occurring bobbed tail that ranges from around 2 to 6 inches long, though some kittens are born with full-length tails.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short or long coat; comes in a variety of colors and patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Mekong Bobtail</h2><p>The Mekong bobtail originated in Thailand centuries ago. It has a naturally bobbed tail that can vary in length and can be curved or kinked in different ways. Thus, every tail on a Mekong bobtail has a slightly different look. These cats don't need a tail to help with their athleticism they're quite agile and love to climb and leap. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, glossy coat with barely any undercoat; comes in a variety of colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 18 years</p><h2>Karelian Bobtail</h2><p>The Karelian bobtail hails from the Republic of Karelia, located between Finland and Russia. Its bobbed tail is a naturally recessive gene, so both parents must have it for the kittens to have it. The tail can be bent, kinked, or twisted, and it sports longer fur than the rest of the body, giving it a pom-pom look. Overall, these cats tend to be quite friendly and easygoing companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Silky, dense, long or short coat; comes in several patterns and colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 18 years</p><h2>Desert Lynx</h2><p>The desert lynx is said to have some bobcat DNA in it. But several domestic cat breeds also are in its genetic makeup, including the Maine coon, Manx, American bobtail, and pixie-bob. Still, these cats do look like bobcats with their muscular body, short tail, and spotted coats. Despite their wild appearance, they tend to be social and affectionate, with somewhat of a dog-like persona.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 16 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Bobcat-like appearance; spotted or ticked coat that is commonly chocolate, silver, black, or blue</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p>",1046

Different cat breeds can have white coats that vary in length and physical attributes like their eye colors.</p><p>White cats are also well-known in presidential history and are considered good luck all around the world. We've gathered nine beautiful white cats and fun facts to grow your admiration for these felines.</p><h2>Many Different Breeds Can Have All-White Coats</h2><p></p><p>Like calico and tortoiseshell cats, all-white cats aren't linked to a specific breed. Rather, many different breeds both long-hair and short-hair can present a pure white coat, including Persians, Turkish Angoras, American Short-Hairs, Siamese, and Devon Rex.</p><p>So, what causes their all-white coats? If a cat has the dominant W gene, known as the masking gene, it will ""hide"" every other coat color and pattern gene in the cat's genetic makeup, resulting in a snowy, white coat.</p><h2>White Cats Can Have Very Unique Eye Colors</h2><p></p><p>Did you know a cat's eye color is linked to the melanin production in the body? Accordingly, white or lightly colored cats often have light eyes. All-white cats can have a variety of striking eye colors, like blue, green, yellow, orange, or a combination of colors.</p><h2>Many (But Not All) White Cats Are Deaf</h2><p></p><p>The same genetic factors that give white cats their snowy coats and unique eye colors can also cause total or partial deafness in many kitties. It's believed that the ear closest to the ""oddly"" colored eye (or both ears if both eyes are uniquely colored) will be the ear with deafness.</p><p>If your cat is partially or completely deaf, there are several precautions you musttake to keep them safe. Be careful not to startle them and use visual signs rather than verbal signs to communicate. It's also best to keep a partially deaf or fully deaf cat indoors at all times; it may have trouble avoiding hazards or protecting itself from potential predators.</p><h2>White Cats Are Not Albino</h2><p></p><p>No, cats with white coats are not albino. There's a key difference: White cats simply have a gene for white fur, while albinism is a genetic condition that results in a complete lack of color pigmentation in the skin, fur, and eyes.</p><p>The easiest way to determine whether or not a cat is an albino is by looking at their eyes. White cats, as previously mentioned, can have a wide range of eye colors. Albino cats, however, often have eyes that look very pale blue, pink, or red. (Their eyes aren't really pink or red; the reflection of light against the blood vessels in their eyes just gives them the appearance.)</p><h2>White Cats Can Get Sunburned, Too</h2><p></p><p>Like humans, cats with light or white coats are at an increased risk of developing sunburn especially on their ears, eyelids, and nose. Because they're more susceptible to sunburns, white cats also have a higher risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma or skin cancer.</p><p></p><h2>White Cats Are Considered Lucky</h2><p></p><p>Unlike allegedly unlucky black cats, all-white cats symbolize good luck and good fortune in cultures across the globe.</p><p>The well-known Japanese Beckoning Cat (also known as ) is most often depicted as a white cat. Originating some time around 1870, these figurines are placed near the entrances of homes and businesses to bring in good luck.</p><h2>Many White Cats Have Lived in the White House</h2><p></p><p>Appropriate, right? Several Presidents of the United States had white cats scurrying around the White House during their terms.</p><h2>White Persian Cats Are the Most Popular</h2><p></p><p>There's no doubt about it: White cats are gorgeous! But the most striking and in-demand white cat, perhaps, is the Persian. Their long, silky coats and big, expressive eyes look super elegant. It's no wonder they've graced kitty-themed calendars and pet food labels for as long as we can remember!</p><p>If you have a white Persian, however, you know regular grooming is key. Otherwise, you'll have a dingy, tangled mess, rather than a model kitty on your hands!</p><h3>Watch Now: 14 Ways Cats Show Their Love</h3>",650

Male Maine coon cats can weigh as much as 18 pounds, while females can weigh up to 16 pounds. Maine coons, on average, measure 39 to 40 inches long.</p><p>These sweet and shaggy creatures are also one of the oldest breeds of domestic cats in the United States, so they have a lot of history. Whether you are already a Maine coon parent or are considering adopting one, you will love these fun facts and cute pictures of these king-sized kitties.</p><h2>Interesting Origin Stories</h2><p>Maine coons are not just fans of the Pine Tree State they actually originated in Maine and are believed to be the only breed of cat from the United States.</p><h2>Their Coats Can Vary Greatly</h2><p></p><p>Although we often think of thick, brown, raccoon-like coats when we think of Maine coons, the colors and patterns in their coats are actually extremely varied. In fact, Maine coons can come in about 75 different color combinations and patterns.</p><h2>Harsh Winter Weather Cat</h2><p>Because they originated in a cold climate with harsh winters, Maine coons are always dressed for severe winter weather. They have super dense, water-resistant coats (that actually make them excellent swimmers), and massive, tufted paws that basically serve as miniature, built-in snow boots. To top that, their extra long, bushy tails can be wrapped around their bodies for additional warmth.</p><h2>Meowless Kitties</h2><p></p><p>While most cats and kittens let out a meow to communicate with their people (and occasionally, other cats), Maine coons do not truly meow. Instead, they chirp and trill (which is a combination of a meow and a purr).</p><p>It is believed that cats chirp when they see prey and express happiness with a trill which would make sense for Maine coons as they were often used as mousers and hunters.</p><h2>Cat That Likes Water</h2><p>Unlike many cats, Maine coon cats actually like water and are super strong swimmers. Their extra dense, moisture-resistant coats keep them relatively dry when they are exposed to water.</p><h2>First Prize Cat</h2><p></p><p>At the first American cat show held in New York City's Madison Square Garden in 1895, a brown tabby Maine coon named Cosey took first place.</p><p>After the New York City cat show, their popularity skyrocketed. When the Cat Fanciers' Association formed in 1906, a Maine coon named Molly Bond was the fifth cat ever registered. Then in 1968, the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association was formed.</p><p>Today, Maine coons are the third most popular breed in the United States and are highly prized in Europe and Japan, too.</p><h2>Official State Cat of Maine</h2><p>love.maya / Instagram</p><p>In 1985, Maine coons were officially recognized as the state cat of Maine. Their unique origin story, built-in winter wear, and large size make them the perfect representative for America's Pine Tree State.</p><h2>Guinness World Records Cats</h2><p>It is no secret that Maine coons are massive felines. But one Maine coon named Stewie cinched the Guinness World Record for the world's longest domestic cat. From nose to tail, Stewie measured a whopping 48.5 inches in length. For reference, the average Maine coon measures 39 to 40 inches in length.</p><h2>Ground-Breaking Science Cat</h2><p>The first pet to be commercially cloned was a Maine coon named Little Nicky. In 2004, his owner paid $50,000 to the now-closed Genetic Savings and Clone, Inc. to clone some of Little Nicky's tissue she had saved in a gene bank. Reportedly, the cloned kitty looked and acted just like Little Nicky.</p><p>Maine Coons are a large cats, with an average weight of 11 to 25 pounds, with the males being larger than the females.</p><p>Maine Coons live from 12 to 15 years.</p><p>There are many opinions about what Maine Coons should have included in their diet.

According to his work, they were immune to the feline leukemia virus; he hoped this research could eventually be applied to humans with compromised immune systems.</p><p>Centerwall became critically ill and gave his hybrid kitties to Jean Sudgen Mill.

Although many Siamese cats are a silver-gray color with blue eyes, these pretty kitties' coats can also be orange, brown, cream, and even blue or lilac-colored, among other coat variations. However, there's much more to Siamese cats than their mysteriously good looks.</p><p>For example, Siamese cats are one of the oldest breeds of domesticated cats in the world, and their coat coloring is determined by their genetics and the temperature of their surroundings.</p><p>If you want to learn more and look at some cute Siamese cats read on!</p><h2>Coat Coloring</h2><p></p><p>As we said, Siamese cats' coats can be an incredible range of colors and those colors aren't only determined by genetics. Grab your lab coat and get ready for a little bit of biology.</p><p>The color of a cat's coat is determined by several sets of genes and the patterns of their coats are determined by modifier genes. Genetics 101, right? Well, Siamese cats have a special modifier gene that inhibits pigment from developing in the fur, resulting in albinism. But, thanks to the magic of science, the modifier gene for albinism can only affect the cat's fur above a certain temperature or between 100 and 102.5 degrees, to be more precise.</p><p>Once a Siamese cat's body drops below approximately 100 degrees or the cat is in a colder environment her genes for coat color turn back on and carry pigment to her fur. Because a cat's body is cooler around her nose, ears, paws, and tail, that's where pigment is most commonly deposited on Siamese cats.</p><p>Most Siamese cats are born completely white and develop their markings in the weeks following birth. Why? Because the womb is very warm and blocks the cat's color gene from reaching her fur. Following birth and being exposed to the cooler atmosphere for a few weeks, Siamese kittens will start to develop pigment around their faces, tails, and paws.</p><h2>An Old Breed</h2><p>Although no one is certain when Siamese cats were first bred and domesticated, it's commonly believed that they originated in Thailand around the 14th century, when they first appeared in a Thai manuscript. This would make them one of the oldest cat breeds in the entire world.</p><h2>Common Traits</h2><p></p><p>For a long time, many Siamese cats had crossed eyes and crooked, kinked tails. Although these traits were undoubtedly the result of certain genetic factors, many legends offered alternate explanations for Siamese cats' interesting appearances.</p><p>According to one legend, a group of Siamese cats was tasked with guarding a golden, royal goblet. Performing their duties, the cats stared at the goblet with such intensity that their eyes crossed. And because they wrapped their tails around the goblet for extra security, their tails became permanently bent.</p><p>There are still Siamese cats with crossed eyes and crooked tails today, but it's not nearly as common. These traits were determined ""undesirable"" by cat fanciers and selectively bred out. We say the cats are just performing their security guard duties!</p><h2>Royal Treatment</h2><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, Siamese cats were treasured by royal families in Thailand because of their distinctive, unusual, and beautiful appearances. In fact, members of these royal families believed that a Siamese cat would receive their soul when they died and the cat would spend the rest of his long life living in a temple and being pampered by monks and priests. Not a bad gig, huh?</p><h2>Presidential Cats</h2><p></p><p>Although Siamese cats have been domesticated in Asia for centuries, they didn't appear in the United States until the late 1800s. One of the earliest known owners of a Siamese cat was actually U.S. President Rutherford B. Haye's wife, Lucy which means Siamese cats have a history in the White House, too. Her Siamese cat, named Siam, was a gift from a U.S. diplomat serving in Thailand.</p><h2>Movie Stars</h2><p></p><p>Oldies, but goodies, like starred Siamese cats. In fact, the entire plot of is centered on a Siamese named DC (or Darn Cat) who helps stop a kidnapping.</p><p>While DC from helped prevent a fictional kidnapping, two real-life Siamese cats helped foil espionage back in the 1960s. When two Siamese kitties living at the Dutch embassy in Moscow, Russia began scratching at a wall, their owner suspected they were reacting to a noise that couldn't be detected by the human ear. He was right 30 small microphones were discovered behind the wall.</p><h2>A Talkative Breed</h2><p>boba / Instagram</p><p>If you have a Siamese cat (or have spent time around one), you know they're extremely talkative. Siamese cats will vocalize their opinions on their food, observations they make through the window, and basically anything that they encounter throughout the day and night.</p><p>Siamese cats live from 15 to 20 year old, on average.</p><p>Siamese cats, affectionately known as ""Meezers,"" are small-to-medium sized cats that weigh 8 to 14 pounds when they're full grown.</p><p>Siamese cats are so vocal because they're more social than other cats.

The colors in their coats are either ""bridled"" and look like they're woven together, or ""patched,"" which means the colors form in large patches all over the body.</p><h2>Most Tortoiseshell Cats Are Female and Males Are Extremely Rare</h2><p></p><p>Like calico cats, you'll find most tortoiseshell cats are female. That's because the same chromosomes that determine their sex also determine the colors in their coats.</p><p>The female sex chromosome (X) also carries the genetic code for orange black coat colors; the male sex chromosome (Y) does not carry information on coat color.</p><p>Because females have two X chromosomes, they have two sets of genetic information that can determine their coat color. The embryo shuts off one X chromosome in each cell, resulting in orange and black color variations in their coats.</p><p>Because a male cat has one X chromosome and one Y chromosome, he'll be orange or black not both.</p><p>In very rare cases about 1 in 3,000 a male tortoiseshell cat can be born with two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome. Unfortunately, male cats with XXY Syndrome are sterile and often have serious health issues, resulting in significantly shorter lifespans than female torties.</p><h2>Torties Have a Distinct Temperament</h2><p></p><p>Tortoiseshell cats aren't a specific breed, but some believe they have a specific temperament.</p><p>In a study conducted by UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, researchers pondered the link between a domestic cat's coat color and its behavior. Tortoiseshell cats (along with calicos and ""torbies"") were the main focus of the study.</p><p>After the study was published, word spread that tortoiseshell cats have a distinct, somewhat sassy temperament, which was quickly coined ""tortitude."" And, anecdotally, many tortie parents agreed that their cats were high-energy, sassy, and even slightly aggressive.</p><p>But concluded in the study results, researchers actually didn't find a distinct link between coat color and behavior, temperament, or personality.</p><p>Maybe ""tortiude"" was just confused with regular old cases of catitude.</p><h2>Tortoiseshell Cats Are Considered Good Luck All Over the World</h2><p></p><p>Many countries have auspicious legends about tortoiseshell cats. </p><h2>They're Named After Tortoiseshell Material</h2><p></p><p>Tortoiseshell from real, live tortoises was a super high-end material that was used to produce jewelry, eyeglasses, and home decor items prior to the 1970s. Tortoiseshell cats were named after this material because their coats are reminiscent of the colors and pattern.</p><p>Because tortoise populations were being decimated worldwide due to high-demand, the use of the material was banned by the CITES treaty and synthetic tortoiseshell was developed.</p><h2>Tortoiseshell Cats Can Also Be ""Torbies""</h2><p></p><p>When you cross a tortoiseshell cat's coloring with a tabby's stripes, you get a ""torbie."" You may also hear them being referred to as ""tortoiseshell tabbies"" or ""striped torties."" They have gorgeous, colorful coats with distinctive stripes with lots of variation.</p><p>Tortoiseshell cats, otherwise known as torties, are named after the material they look like: their fur is a m lange of black, red, orange, yellow, or cream. Like calicos, they are usually female.</p><p>Torties aren't a specific breed; they are a mixed-breed, American shorthair.</p><p>Tortoiseshell cats are not rare, and you can find them through shelters, fosters, and rescue groups. What is rare is a male tortoiseshell, about one in 3,000!</p><h3>Watch Now: If Your Cat Could Text, They Would Say This</h3><p>Are There Male Calico Cats? .</p><p>Centerwall, WR, and K Benirschke.

They are more commonly called orange, ginger, marmalade, yellow, butter, caramel, or butterscotch.</p><p>Red cats are not their own breed and you can find them in many cat breeds as well as moggies (cats with no pedigree). They may be shorthair or longhair cats. If you are looking for a lovely ginger cat, you will have a wide variety of breeds and coats to choose from. You may want a red cat that has tiger stripes or one with spots or patches.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About Red Cats</h3><h2>Personality</h2><p>Many people believe that red cats have warm personalities that match their coat color, thinking they tend to be mellow, loving cats. However, cats are individuals and you may find yours to be a bossy alpha cat or one with a fiery, hot temper. Cat personalities are not as typically linked to breeds as are those of dogs. They haven't been bred for skills and temperaments as dogs have. But if you are looking for a specific personality, start with researching what is usual for different cat breeds.</p><h2>The Red Gene</h2><p>The reason a cat is red lies in the genes and chromosomes the cat has inherited. The study of genetics is so complicated and detailed that it takes many years of concentrated study to come even close to mastering it. The red color gene O codes for the production of the red pigment phaeomelanin. It is dominant, so it masks all of the other colors (such as black and variants of black).</p><p>The primary red color gene is carried on the X chromosome, and it is therefore sex-linked. A male cat usually has only one X chromosome as it is paired with the Y chromosome and males are XY. A female cat has two X chromosomes and are XX.</p><p>The red gene may be the O variant, producing red pigment, or the o variant that does not. If a male inherits the O variant from his mother, he will be red. If he inherits the o, he instead can express the black pigment coded on other genes. He won't ever be both red and black (which would make him calico or tortoiseshell), except in unusual cases of inheriting multiple X chromosomes or merging with a twin before birth.</p><p>Females who have O on each of their X chromosomes (OO) will be red. If they are Oo, they will be calico or tortoiseshell and have both red and black markings. If they are oo, they will be black. Because there are these different possible combinations, females have less of a chance of being only red than males do. About 80 percent of red cats are male and only 20 percent are female.</p><p>A male red cat can only be born from a mother who is red, calico, or tortoiseshell. A female red cat can only be born from a cross between a male red cat and a female red, calico, or tortoiseshell cat.</p><p>When a cat has the dilute gene, which is separate from the color gene, they have a lighter shade of red that looks like a creamy buff.</p><h2>Tabby Influence</h2><p>All red cats are tabby cats. The agouti gene determines whether a cat has a tabby pattern or not, but the non-agouti gene doesn't work when the red pigment is expressed. Although some red cats (usually dilutes) may appear to be a solid color, upon closer examination, you will see the pale stripes, whorls, or spots of the tabby. You will also see the distinctive tabby facial markings, including the magnificent ""M"" of tabby cats.</p><p>Red kittens usually have more obvious tabby markings. These may fade or disappear as they grow into adult cats.</p><p></p><h2>Eye Colors</h2><p>While kittens start off with blue eyes, they will usually produce other colors as they mature. The eyes of red cats eyes may be green, gold, or copper. Many have golden or topaz eyes.</p><p>Whether you call them red, marmalade, or orange, these sunshine cats will go a long way in brightening and lightening your home and your life.</p><p>No, red is a very common color for tabbies.</p><p>It's a difference in name only. Red tabbies are also called marmalades or gingers.</p><p>Most are, about 80 percent, leaving 20 percent to be females.</p>",709

It is France's national dog; however, the poodle did not originate in France. The breed was standardized in France, where it became the trend. It's originally from Germany, where it was raised as a water dog.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>French dogs come in all shapes, sizes, coat types, and specialized skills. The French used dogs to hunt, protect their livestock and homes, herd, and as companions. Though no common thread really ties these different breeds together, one thing is clear, French people love dogs. Nearly 50 percent of all households in France include a pet. Dogs continuously rank as the preferred pet.</p><h2>Basset Hound</h2><p>These popular hound dogs were developed in France and Belgium to create a close-to-the-ground scent hound. The word ""basset"" in French means low. Because of their excellent and persistent scenting talents, basset hounds became popular with the French hunting aristocracy. They are amiable, loyal, and low-energy dogs that are a popular choice as a family pet. Bassets can be stubborn, though, and a little extra patience may be required when it comes to training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat that comes in combinations of black/mahogany, white, brown/tan, red, and lemon</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Berger Picard</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 25.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Shaggy and rough outer coat with a soft, short, and dense undercoat; comes in fawn (tan) or brindle (light or dark base coat color with contrasting stripes)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Beauceron</h2><p>Beaucerons get their name from the region surrounding Paris that they originated in-La Beauce. A very old breed, there's evidence of dogs resembling the Beauceron going as far back as the 16th century in France. These large dogs were traditionally used for livestock herding. Their strength, size, intelligence, and bravery meant they were drafted into the World War efforts. They're still being used by the police for search and rescue. Rare outside their native country, Beaucerons are a great companion for the right home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 27.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 110 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and dense coat; comes in black and tan and harlequin (a mix of gray, black, and tan)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Briard</h2><p>Briards are an ancient breed still in existence, possibly dating to the 8th century. These dogs worked on the dairy farms in the Brie region of France and were known for their versatility. They're skilled herders, but they also protected the flocks from predators. These dogs also put their stamina, courage, and intelligence to use during the war efforts, and they were named the official dog of the French Army during World War I.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coarse, dry, flat, long and wavy topcoat with a fine undercoat; long hair on their head that comes over their eyes; comes in black, gray or tawny;</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 years</p><h2>Brittany</h2><p>The Brittany comes from the northwest region of France with the same name. Although they're often referred to as spaniels, the Brittany is an unpretentious pointing breed that poachers and peasants favored from the 17th century. They were regarded as versatile and all-around hunting dogs, meaning owners didn't need to have multiple breeds for hunting expeditions.</p><p>Brittanys are popular in their native country and North America. They tend to be intelligent, playful, and affectionate. They excel in dog sports and are very energetic. They would suit an active home. They develop strong bonds with their owners and are prone to separation anxiety, so they are best suited for homes where they'll have company for most of the day. Their hunting instincts and tendency to roam when off the leash means you might have to put in some extra work on recall training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17.5 to 20.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Flat or wavy, dense coat that comes in orange and white or liver and white markings and sometimes with roan patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Dogue De Bordeaux</h2><p>The dogue de Bordeaux, sometimes called the French mastiff, is another ancient dog breed. The breed was introduced to France by the Romans, who used these powerful dogs to fight in battles and gladiator rings. Although they were traditionally prized for their fighting prowess, by the 17th century, they worked on the grand estates of French nobles. They were primarily used as guard dogs and would also hunt and herd.</p><p>The breed is known for being unfailingly loyal, protective, and affectionate with its family. Dogues aren't suited for novice dog owners. They're powerful, their protective instincts can become excessive without the proper training, and they don't always get along well with other dogs. Be prepared for a lot of slobber too.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 100 to 110 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat comes in various shades of fawn, ranging from light to dark red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 8 years</p><h2>French Bulldog</h2><p>Frenchies have soared in popularity in recent years and are now one of the most sought-after breeds in the United States. These dogs were developed in France after lace makers from the UK brought toy bulldogs to northern France. They were crossed with other breeds there and soon became fashionable with the affluent ladies of Paris. Known for their fun-loving, affectionate nature, Frenchies make popular family pets. They can be prone to respiratory issues and can overheat more easily due to their flattened faces.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 19 to 28 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat in brindle, fawn, white, or combination of brindle and white or fawn and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Grand Basset Griffon Vend&eacute;en</h2><p></p><p>The grand basset griffon Vend&eacute;en, also called the GBGV for short, was developed in the Vend&eacute;e region of France in the 16th century as a hardy, determined hunter capable of bringing down large game. By the early 20th century, breeders developed two varieties, the larger GBGV and the smaller petit basset griffon Vend&eacute;en. These days, outside of their native France, the GBGV is still rare. They're known for being loyal and affectionate, but they can also be stubborn, have a high prey drive, and need a lot of exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15.5 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 45 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Rough, scruffy, double coat that comes in various colors including tri-color, yellow, orange, black, and sable; has a distinctive longer beard and eyebrows</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Great Pyrenees</h2><p>As their name suggests, Great Pyrenees were bred hundreds of years ago to guard livestock against wolves in the snowy Pyrenees Mountain region between France and Spain. It's fair to say that their patience and courage are legendary. Their majestic appearance and calm nature became popular with French nobility by the 17th century.</p><p>The breed still works with the shepherds in these mountainous areas, and, despite their size and power, the Pyr is a popular companion dog. Pyrs are known for being incredibly calm, loyal, and affectionate. They're usually gentle with children and other dogs. Their thick coat sheds a lot, and they're big, strong, energetic, and are prolific alert barkers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 32 inches</p><p>Weight: 100 to 150 pounds (males); 85 to 110 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat and Color: Large, powerful dog with a thick double coat in white (may have markings of gray, tan, badger, or reddish-brown)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p>",1245

The list of dogs from this part of the world is as comprehensive as Latin America is vast.</p><p>Here are 15 dog breeds from Central and South America.</p><h2>Chihuahua</h2><p>One of the most popular of all the Latin American breeds, the Chihuahua, is closely related to the Techichi dog developed by the Aztecs in ancient Mexico. In the mid 19th century, as the breed gained popularity, most of these small dogs came from the Mexican state of Chihuahua, its namesake.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 to 6 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth coats or long coats; seen in many colors, either solid or a combination of two colors including black, tan, fawn, cream, white, blue, silver, chocolate, and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 20 years</p><h2>Xoloitzcuintli (Mexican Hairless Dog)</h2><p>The Xoloitzcuintli is also called the Mexican hairless dog. it's pronounced ""show-low-eats-QUEENT-lee"" or Xolo (""show-low"") for short. This ancient Mexican breed traces back to the Aztec people over 3,000 years ago. The Xolo was revered by the tribes and considered sacred, and today they're classed as the country's national dog.</p><p>Most commonly found in the hairless variety, with just a few tufts of hair on their head, they also come in a coated variation. The Xolo also comes in three sizes; toy, miniature, and standard. The loyal Xolo bonds closely with their family members.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: Standard: 30 to 55 pounds; Miniature: 15 to 30 pounds; Toy: 10 to 15 pounds</p><p>Weight: Standard: 18 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder; Miniature: 14 to 18 inches; Toy: 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Tough, smooth skin that usually has dark pigmentation; tufts of hair on the top of the head and sometimes on the feet and tail too; coated variety has a short, smooth fur covering and they come in a range of colors including black, gray-black, slate, red, liver (brown), or bronze</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 yo 17 years</p><h2>Dogo Argentino</h2><p>As the name suggests, this canine originates from Argentina, where it developed as a big-game hunting dog. They're a relatively new breed, only around since the 1920s. Despite being bred for their strength, stamina, bravery, and power, they can make great family pets when matched appropriately with the right home.</p><p>These dogs require consistent guidance and socialization training. They tend to be consistently loyal, very protective and patient, gentle, and often playful with respectful older children. Their protective instincts mean they may start to exhibit guarding behaviors and may not like the company of strange dogs. Most Argentinos have a high prey drive and aren't generally suited to living in households with small furry pets. These dogs are smart and energetic, and they will need plenty of daily exercise and enrichment to keep them from becoming bored.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 80 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: All-white, smooth, and short coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 15 years</p><h2>Havanese</h2><p>The Havanese is Cuba's only native dog breed. These dogs were first developed in the early 16th century when settlers came to the Island from Spain.

These smart little dogs can be playful and affectionate, but they also make good watchdogs. They aren't, however, as prolific barkers as other small breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8.5 to 11.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 13 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Varies; Silky straight to very wavy with ringlets in black, silver, white, cream, tan, fawn, gold, sable, and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 16 years</p><h2>Chamuco</h2><p>The chamuco or ""devil"" is more widely known as the Mexican pit bull. It's a new and controversial breed type; people developed these crosses to be a powerful, brave, tenacious dog that would excel in secret, illegal fighting rings. They aren't suited for novice dog owners but can respond best to positive, force-free training methods.</p><p>It's believed that the Chamuco developed in the 1970s, mixing the American pit bull terrier with the now-extinct Mexican bulldog and some other bull breed types. You generally won't find the Chamuco outside of Mexico.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not a recognized breed</p><p>Height: 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth in white, brown, and black are common</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Argentine Pila</h2><p>Monica S.

Curly-coiffed pups like poodles and Portuguese water dogs were developed for sporting since their tight curls serve as good insulation for water activities. A herding breed like the Pumi and a companion breed like the bichon also feature abundant coils.</p><p>Here are 13 curly-haired dog breeds, including their grooming needs.</p><h3></h3><h2>Poodle</h2><p>When it comes to curly-haired dogs, perhaps the first breed that people think of is the poodle. The fluffy poodle is a classic curly-haired dog in large, miniature, and toy sizes. These dogs are known to be highly intelligent and make excellent companions. The standard poodle was originally bred as a keen retriever of game.</p><p>Historically, owners clipped the tight curls to keep the vital organs and joints of the dog warm as it plunged into the chilly water. Today, the classic poodle cut is more about fashion than function. Whether your dog is a water retriever or a homebody, be prepared to learn to trim your dog's coat yourself or find a capable groomer in your area since these coats need frequent trimming to stave off tangles.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: Standard: 15 inches; miniature: 10 to 15 inches; toy: 10 inches and under</p><p>Weight: Standard: 45 to 70 pounds; miniature: 15 to 18 pounds; toy: 5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Curly, dense single-layer coats that may be one of many solid colors, including white, black, gray, brown, and apricot</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Portuguese Water Dog</h2><p>The Portuguese water dog, or PWD, is another of the sporty curly-haired dog breeds. Originally bred to assist fishermen in retrieving lost tackle or even rescuing drowning sailors, these dogs needed to be strong and agile swimmers. Today, the breed is popular as both a companion pet or a canine competitor in sports like dock diving, agility, or obedience.</p><p>The Portuguese water dog's coat is hypoallergenic. This breed is considered to be a very minimal shedder but requires regular grooming. You can opt for a standard clipping overall to maintain a coat length of about one inch or go for the ""lion clip,"" which means shaving the hair on the hindquarters and the muzzle down to the skin.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 60 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Wavy or tightly curled coat; black, black and white, and brown, though color may also be white or silver-tipped</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2>Bichon Frise</h2><p>The name ""bichon frise"" literally means ""curly-haired dog"" in French. This small companion dog has a white, powder-puff-like coat. It has short, fluffy curls that give the dog a round appearance when groomed right. These dogs have soft hair and coarse guard hairs, which can lead to matting. The Bichon Frise Club of America recommends daily brushing and a monthly trip to the groomer for a bath and haircut.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Fluffy and curly white hair (may have traces of apricot, buff, or cream), resembling a cotton ball or powder-puff</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Airedale Terrier</h2><p>The Airedale is the largest of the terrier breeds and has one of the most distinctive coats. Typically brown and tan in color, the wiry coat can be tightly curled or may have a more relaxed curl that resembles a wave. It's notably different in texture than many other terriers.</p><p>The Airedale terrier is a low-maintenance, hypoallergenic dog. You should brush or use a stripping comb to go through the curls each week but will only need to visit the groomer for a haircut three to four times a year. This schedule saves significant time and money compared to the monthly grooming needs of other curly-haired breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Sturdy yet athletic in appearance; tight, curly coat in black and tan; typically has a beard on the muzzle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Pumi</h2><p>The Hungarian Pumi has a unique medium-length coat characterized by a combination of curls and waves and is a mixture of softer hair and more coarse guard hair. At birth, the Pumi's coat is usually straight or wavy. After a few months, the coat changes as the guard hairs grow, resulting in its characteristic curls. Unlike other Hungarian herding breeds, like the Puli and Komondor, the Pumi's hair should not be corded.</p><p>Grooming a Pumi includes the time-consuming method of hand stripping. The coat could be clipped, which may change its texture and appearance. In between visits to the groomer, comb the curls every few weeks. After combing, wet the curls, and let them air-dry so they spring back to life. Blow-drying this dog's coat will flatten the curls.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15 to 18.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 22 to 29 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Compact body with semi-erect ears and a tail that curls over the back; wavy, curly coat in black, white, gray, or fawn</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Curly-Coated Retriever</h2><p>The curly-coated retriever is one of the largest curly-haired dog breeds and one of the oldest retriever breeds. Curly-haired dogs like Irish water spaniels and poodles likely contributed to this breed's development. These dogs were hunting companions that retrieved game from lakes and rivers in all sorts of weather and often trudged through brambles and thorns. The curls kept the dog warm and acted as protection against the brush.</p><p>Unlike other curly-haired dog breeds, these dogs have a single coat of hair that sheds every six months or so. Regularly comb the curls (especially during shedding season), but avoid brushing the coat, or else it will create a frizzy appearance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 90 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Small, tight, water- and weather-resistant in solid black and dark brown; curls cover the body from the tail all the way up to the top of the head with a feathering fringe of hair on the ears, belly, thighs, feet, legs, and tail</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 14 years</p><h2>Bedlington Terrier</h2><p>The Bedlington terrier bears a resemblance to a lamb-and feels as soft as one with its combination of soft and coarse hair. The dog's head tends to be the curliest part of its body. These dogs are often born with a dark coat, which gradually lightens to a softer blue, sandy, or dark-brown liver color.</p><p>Maintaining the coat of a Bedlington terrier isn't too complicated, and it doesn't shed as much. A weekly combing will keep the curls free of debris and matting. You can learn to trim the dog's coat yourself or make an appointment with a groomer about every eight weeks.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 17 to 23 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Arched back; shaggy, rugged curls; colors include blue, liver, and sandy shades, with or without tan markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Bolognese</h2><p>The Bolognese is a companion breed related to the bichon frise. Unlike the bichon, which has tight, short curls, the Bolognese has medium-length curly fur. This wavy look means it needs its coat brushed a few times each week, though it's probably best to make it a daily habit.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Stock Service; this breed is not registered by the AKC but can be recorded for breeding and competition purposes</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 5.5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Petite dog with long, curly hair that's always solid white with a black nose and dark eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p>",1235

Many of those are extremely rare, even in their home country of Spain. Spanish dog breeds were livestock protectors, herders, and hunters. In periods of war, the Spanish used starved dogs in combat to fight with ravenous, viciousness.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Many of these dogs have strong working or hunting drives. Do your research to determine if the typical breed traits and characteristics will be a good match for your home and lifestyle. These dogs usually require mental stimulation, plenty of exercise, and goal-oriented, positive reinforcement training.</p><h2>Catalan Sheepdog</h2><p>This is an ancient breed that has been used to herd and protect livestock in the northeast of Spain. Rare outside of their home country, they're more common in European countries than in the United States. Their distinctive long coat kept them warm when working in the mountainous and often chilly Pyrenean mountains. The Catalan sheepdog is an intelligent, driven, and hard-working breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Pastoral Group (UKC); not an AKC recognized breed</p><p>Height: 17 to 19 inches</p><p>Weight: 37 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Double coat; topcoat is long and flat or wavy; comes in sable, fawn, or gray, and shades of red, brown, white, or black throughout the coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Ibizan Hound</h2><p>With their large, erect ears and svelte shape, the Ibizan hound is a distinctive and elegant sighthound. They originate from the Balearic Islands, off the coast of Spain. These dogs have a very long history; their ancestors can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Fast, agile, and full of stamina, it hunts rabbits and hares. With a high prey drive, they may not be suited to living with small furries, and you have to work hard to achieve a solid recall.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 28 inches (males); 22 to 26 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 50 pounds (male); 45 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Coarse hair that can be smooth or wiry; comes in solid red, solid white, or white and red patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Perro de Presa Canario</h2><p>Often shortened to presa Canario, it means prey dog from the Canary Islands. This large mastiff-type breed is an impressive guard dog and livestock herder on farms. Sadly, people also used them for dogfighting. They're calm, intelligent, and utterly devoted to their families. They can also be strong-willed, and they're best suited to an experienced home that can handle this strong breed and tame its guarding traits.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 84 to 110 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and coarse coat in brown/black, fawn, or brindle, occasionally with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 11 years</p><h2>Podenco</h2><p>There are several podenco types in Spain, meaning ""hound"" in Spanish. These sighthound breeds are characterized by their pointed, large, erect ears and sleep shape. They come in a wide variety of sizes. The Ibizan hound is considered a podenco. These sighthounds were commonly used for hunting rabbits across the different regions of Spain. Unfortunately, podencos are often mistreated by traditional hunter owners, who treat them as tools instead of caring for them as valued creatures.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 13 inches to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 18 pounds to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, wire, or long-coated in a variety of colors, most commonly brown or red and often with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Spanish Galgo</h2><p>Perhaps the most recognizable of all the breeds to originate in Spain, the Galgo Espanol is easily confused with the greyhound. They are often called the Spanish greyhound. Although they're slightly smaller, they look similar and have a comparable temperament. Galgos, with their incredible bursts of speed, agility, and stamina, have been used for hunting in Spain for hundreds of years. Like podencos, they often suffer extreme cruelty, neglect, and even death at the hands of their hunter owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 65 pounds (males); 50 to 55 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short smooth or rough coat that comes in a wide variety of solid and mixed color varieties, including brindle, black and golden</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Spanish Mastiff</h2><p>The Spanish mastiff or mast&iacute;n Espa&ntilde;ol is a giant breed developed to protect livestock in rural Spain, especially Merino sheep. They have a long history, and their ancestors were thought to have arrived in the country with the Greeks and Phoenicians over 2,000 years ago. They were popular with Spanish shepherds as they're intelligent, independent protectors that take their guarding and defensive duties seriously. Fiercely loyal and generally calm, despite their size, they don't need huge amounts of exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Molossoid/mountain (FCI); not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 28 to 35 inches</p><p>Weight: 140 to 200 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, medium-length coat that comes in a variety of colors including black, fawn, red, gray, and yellow, and can be seen with brindle or white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Spanish Water Dog</h2><p>The Spanish water dog stands out because of its distinctive curly, woolly coat that can form into cords when long. The breed was initially developed as a hard-working all-purpose farm dog that could guard, herd, and catch vermin. With webbed feet, a waterproof coat, and strong swimming skills, people also used them for waterfowl retrieval and fishing boats. Active, alert, and intelligent, this Spanish dog often excels at competitive dog sports.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17.5 to 19.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Unique curly and wooly single coat that comes in black, brown-beige, white, solid, or parti-color with white as the second color</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Bichon Frise</h2><p>The bichon frise is most commonly associated with France, where they grew in popularity as a companion dog in the 16th century. But this merry little breed originated from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, where people used them as sailing dogs and sometimes even as eager little herders. Bichons are compact, playful, and usually have happy-go-lucky personalities with moderate exercise requirements. They are a popular choice as a family dog and can adapt well to apartment living.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Fluffy and curly white hair and may have traces of apricot, buff, or cream</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 15 years</p><h2>Majorca Shepherd Dog</h2><p>The perro de pastor Mallorquin or Majorcan sheepdog was used in the Balearic Islands for guarding sheep and as a general-purpose farm dog. Its lineage traces back to the 1200s, although its history likely dates back to ancient times. While still used on Spanish farms today and kept as a companion animal, this breed is rarely spotted internationally and is considered a rare breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (UKC); not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: Up to 27.5 inches</p><p>Weight: Up to 88 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short-haired or long-haired with very fine, thin undercoat in black, usually with a patch of white on the chest</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2>Pyrenean Mastiff</h2><p>The Pyrenean mastiff is an intelligent livestock guard dog from the Pyrenees Mountains, which ranges from Spain and France. It protected flocks from wolves, bears, and thieves. This dog doesn't have a high prey drive but instead guards its family and other animals. It loves children and people it knows. A strong breed, it does not back down when threatened. It's a big drooler, so expect a little clean-up in its wake.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Molossoid/mountain (FCI); not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 25 to 31 inches</p><p>Weight: 120 to 240 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, double coated with a white base coat with patches of color, including medium gray, deep gold, sand, dusk, black, silver gray, light tan, sand, brindle, and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 13 years</p>",1278

They usually possess some traits of both small and large dogs, and their maintenance also generally falls somewhere in the middle. If you've been looking for a dog that is bound to be a great companion, we rounded up some of the best and most popular mid-sized dog breeds to choose from.</p><p>Here are 20 of the best medium-size dog breeds from which to choose.</p><h3>Breed Characteristics</h3><p>The way people define medium-size dogs can vary. Some organizations break down dog sizes into detailed groups, including extra-small, small, small-medium, medium, medium-large, large, extra-large, and giant. But, in general, small dog breeds tend to go up to about 20 pounds, and large dog breeds begin around 60 pounds. So anything in the middle would be a medium-sized dog. Because of this wide weight range-20 to 60 pounds-medium-size dogs make up a large portion of the breeds in existence.</p><h2>American Staffordshire Terrier</h2><p>American Staffordshire terriers are on the larger side for medium-size dogs, with female Am Staffs typically being slightly smaller than the males. They often appear even larger than they actually are due to their muscular bodies and broad heads. These dogs tend to be highly affectionate and energetic, and they make wonderful companions for active households.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 18 to 19 inches (male); 17 to 18 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds (male); 40 to 55 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, glossy coat that comes in many colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Australian Cattle Dog</h2><p>The Australian cattle dog is an active and intelligent dog breed that is right in the middle of the medium-size category.

Besides their iconic red coloring, the shiba inu can also have a black and tan coat. This breed has a thick coat that sheds a large amount, particularly during their molting season twice a year. Frequent brushing during these times can help reduce the tufts of fur floating around the house.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15.5 to 16.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 17 to 23 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Stiff and straight outer coat with a soft and thick undercoat; colors range from golden to red or black and tan</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 16 years</p><h2>Golden Retriever</h2><p>The golden retriever's coat may come in a variety of gold shades, some tipping into deep mahogany tones that appear red to the eye.

Some of the dogs have snowy white coats that match their Arctic or mountain environments, such as the Samoyed, Great Pyrenees, and Japanese spitz. Most of the others are showy lapdogs that served kings and nobles as companions.</p><p>Here are 9 exclusively white dog breeds.</p><h2>Samoyed</h2><p>A regal-looking white spitz breed, the Samoyed is a medium-to-large dog that is white from head to toe. The thick, fluffy nature of the coat makes perfect sense when considering that this dog breed originated in Siberia. The indigenous Samoyed people used these strong and cold-weather tolerant dogs to herd reindeer, pull sleds, and hunt. The Samoyed has a tail that curls up over its back and a thick ruff of fur around its neck. Though these dogs are generally an all-white breed, some mature into a cream or biscuit-colored coat. Life with this white dog breed means a flurry of fur year-round. While these dogs shed their undercoat seasonally, white hair is likely to be found on your clothes and furniture year-round.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 19 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat; colors include white, cream, and biscuit</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Maltese</h2><p>The smallest white dog breed is the Maltese. These pocket-sized pups mature to a weight of only 4 to 7 pounds and stay under 10 inches tall. The long and silky white coat of the Maltese adds to the cuteness of this famous companion dog, though some owners opt to keep it clipped short. Expect to invest some time in brushing your dog each week and taking regular trips to the groomer. The black button eyes and nose of the Maltese seem to peek out from behind the pure white hair, and many Maltese dogs sport a top knot or bow to keep the hair out of their eyes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Solid white fur that is long and silky; dark alert eyes and black nose</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>West Highland White Terrier</h2><p>The West Highland white terrier sports a double coat of white fur. The Westie, as this white dog breed is commonly referred to, is a compact but sturdy terrier from Scotland. Originally bred to hunt vermin, the white coat of this dog breed served to help the dog stand out while out hunting. The Westie is primarily a companion dog and is intelligent and playful. To keep the white coat looking its best, it needs consistent brushing each week and regular visits to the groomer every four to six weeks.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: White double-coated, medium-length fur white coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>American Eskimo</h2><p>Like a little snowman, the American Eskimo is a pure white dog breed with coal-black eyes and nose. These dogs come in standard, miniature, and toy sizes. Regardless of the size, it has a fluffy white coat and alert expression. The breed is known for being highly intelligent and was famous for performing as a circus dog in the early 1900s.</p><p>Contrary to its name, the Eskie developed in the midwestern United States at the end of the 19th century. It used to be known as the German Spitz, was selectively bred to be snowy white, and used as a farm dog by German settlers. After World War I, the breed's name was changed to American Eskimo. It earned AKC recognition in 1995.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: Toy: 9 to 12 inches tall at the shoulder; miniature: 12 to 15 inches; standard: 15 to 19 inches</p><p>Weight: Toy: 6 to 10 pounds; miniature: 10 to 20 pounds; standard: 25 to 35 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: All-white, stand-off double coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Bichon Frise</h2><p>It's easy to spot the bichon frise in a crowd of white dogs, thanks to its fluffy fur and rounded appearance. The breed as we know it today originated in France and is believed to be descended from the poodle and water spaniel. With these sporting breeds in its heritage, it's no surprise that the bichon is an active and adventurous companion dog. Just be sure that whatever adventures you encounter with your powderpuff by your side, you provide regular brushing to avoid matting and take your dog to the groomer regularly to maintain that classic groomed appearance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Fluffy and curly white hair (may have traces of apricot, buff, or cream), resembling a cotton ball or powder puff</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Great Pyrenees</h2><p>The largest white dog breed is the Great Pyrenees. These gentle giants can weigh 100 pounds or more and feature a thick, double coat of white fur. This type of dog likely originated in Central Asia or Siberia many millennia ago. It has since acquired its name after being brought to the Pyrenees mountains that border France and Spain.</p><p>These dogs are known for being immensely large but also patient. They excel as herd guardians but also as loyal family companions. Living with the Great Pyrenees means preparing yourself for year-round shedding, though several brushing sessions a week will help to capture loose fur that would otherwise cling to you, your furniture, or your floors.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 32 inches</p><p>Weight: 85 pounds and up</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat; colors include white with gray, red, or tan markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Coton de Tulear</h2><p>This small white dog was formerly a jealously guarded pet to the elite of Madagascar. It's believed that the early ancestors of these dogs were seafaring pups that kept sailors company. These small but sturdy pups make excellent companion dogs. They're known to be good with children and other pets, too. To keep the Coton de Tulear's fur looking its best, it needs combing several times each week. Otherwise, the wispy, semi-long fur can quickly become tangled.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Fluffy white coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 16 years</p><h2>Bolognese</h2><p>This friendly white dog breed is small with long, fluffy fur. The breed developed in the city of Bologna in northern Italy from bichons. As a result, these two white dog breeds share many similarities. However, the Bolognese has a more casual appearance when compared to the tighter curls and groomed look of the bichon. The Bolognese is known to be a calm and even shy dog breed compared to the bold, ready-to-go personality of the bichon. The semi-long fur of the Bolognese needs regular attention to keep it from becoming tangled and wild. Brushing its coat several times a week will keep mats from forming.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not AKC-recognized; Foundational Stock Service (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 5.5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, curly hair that is always solid white; a black nose and dark eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Dogo Argentino</h2><p>The Dogo Argentino is one of the most powerful white dog breeds. The short, smooth coat is always white, though a single dark patch over an eye or ear is acceptable. It developed in the early 1920s to hunt large game in Argentina. These dogs have gained attention for their strength, courage, and loyalty. While they require an experienced owner, they are affectionate family dogs and generally love children. The white coat of a Dogo Argentino isn't known to shed profusely or get smelly.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 80 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: All-white, smooth and short coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 15 years</p>",1276

Blue-coated dogs have noses that appear to have a bluish shine to them, and many have blue eyes that emphasize their blue coat sheen. The blue color can vary from light, pale blue, or a deeper, steely shade of blue.</p><p>Blue dogs come in all sizes. Some breeds are known for their blue coat, while others carry the blue coat gene outside the breed standard. Many blue dog breeds are sought after and highly prized for their good looks and unique blue coat markings, including blue tick, blue merle, blue harlequin, blue brindle.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Blue dog breeds carry the recessive genes for blue coat coloration from their parents. Both parent dogs do not have to be blue, but each will have the gene for a diluted black coat. If your dog has the merle gene, it can manifest as mottled patches of color. Merle-pattered dogs cannot consistently create pigment, which explains the bluish coloration.</p><p>Color dilution alopecia is an inherited hair loss that affects dogs that have a dilute fur color, such as blue or fawn. Also known as color mutant alopecia, this inherited disease is a result of a recessive gene that causes hair shafts to break along with overall stunted hair growth.</p><p>Here are the top 12 breeds known for carrying the blue coat gene.</p><h2>Australian Cattle Dog</h2><p>Also known as the blue heeler, it's no surprise that the Australian cattle dog lands on the list of best blue dog breeds. While a red coat is also possible (known as the red heeler), a blue coat on this dog may be solid, mottled, or speckled according to the breed standard. Other markings in black or tan may be present, but the overall impression of a blue heeler is a blue cast.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, hard double-coat; coat color is usually blue, blue mottled, blue speckled, but may also be red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Kerry Blue Terrier</h2><p>As the name suggests, the Kerry blue terrier only comes in one color: blue. This breed has a unique, curly coat that ranges in shade from a deep slate to a light blue-gray. While the muzzle, head, ears, tail, and feet may be darker (or even black), the breed standard calls for a dog that is described as either ""blue-gray"" or ""gray-blue,"" with either color showing more dominantly. However, the blue hue should not be missing. All Kerry blue puppies are born black. Through a process called ""clearing,"" the coat of a Kerry blue terrier gradually changes to the characteristic blue coat color by about 18 months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 19 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, blue coat of curls that is soft and wavy with no undercoat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Weimaraner</h2><p>Weimaraners are typically steely gray, exhibiting their dilute brown coat gene. In some Weimaraners, a black dilute gene occurs instead, producing a dark gray-colored dog or blue Weimaraner. According to the breed standard, blue-coated Weimaraners are disqualified. Dog shows aside, people searching for blue dog breeds are often drawn to the athletic and striking look of a blue Weimaraner.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 90 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat; blue to gray color</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2>Chihuahua</h2><p>One of the smallest dog breeds, there is no shortage of coat colors for the Chihuahua-including a beautiful blue coat.

Tourists flock to Africa to go on safaris, where they have a chance to spot the continent's amazing elephants, giraffes, and lions on wildlife preserves. Typically overlooked are their dogs, which vary enormously and have unique appearances, temperaments, and history. Some breeds are widespread across the globe, while others only exist in Africa.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>The diverse landscape of Africa varies from desert to tropical rainforests and mountains to grassy savannah. African dogs have several common qualities. They've adapted to the continent's hot climate with short coats and lean bodies. They're energetic, working dogs that have developed intense hunting and guarding instincts. They also tend to bond well with their people and have established a reliance on each other.</p><p>Here are 12 unique African dog breeds that dog lovers enjoy.</p><h2>Saluki</h2><p>Looking at a saluki, the first thing you'll notice is how tall and slender they appear. While they are slim, salukis are very strong, balanced, and athletic. Historians believe the breed is one of the oldest globally, possibly dating back to 7000 B.C. Salukis were favorites of Egyptian pharaohs and kings throughout history, and their elegant appearance is likely why they are still popular pets in current times. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the saluki in 1927, which marks its rise in popularity in the U.S.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 28 inches<br />Weight: 40 to 65 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Smooth or feathered coat; colors include white, cream, fawn, golden, tricolor, and black and tan</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Rhodesian Ridgeback</h2><p>The unique Rhodesian ridgeback was created when breeders crossed the native ridged Khoikhoi dog with European breeds like various terriers brought to southern Africa by Dutch colonists. Hunters found these ridged dogs excellent at confronting lions, which made them extremely valuable hunting dogs. They were also proven experts at fending off dangerous animals like leopards and monkeys and could hunt prey, like antelope, for food. The active and loyal breed increases in popularity each year, especially in the U.S.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches<br />Weight: 70 to 85 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Ridge on their back; short and dense coat; colors range from light to red wheaten with small white markings on their chest and toes; may have a black mask</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>African Wild Dog</h2><p>Also known as the painted dog or painted wolf, the African wild dog is a unique canine species Lycaon pictus that typically roams the plains and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa in packs.

These wild dogs are endangered animals.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Wild animal; not a AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 30 inches<br />Weight: 40 to 70 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Spotted markings with patches of red, black, brown, white, and yellow fur</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Aidi (Atlas Mountain Dog)</h2><p>Even though this breed hails from the hot African continent, the Aidi's coat is actually thick, dense, and soft to the touch. Their plush coat is one of the reasons why the Aidi reminds owners so much of traditional sheepdogs. The breed was originally developed in Morocco to protect its owners from predators in the mountains where they worked. Because Aidis are smart, protective, and loyal, they became popular pets. The American Kennel Club does not currently recognize the breed, but it is recognized by several other canine organizations and continues to prove its excellence in North Africa.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Guardian (UKC), Molossian (FCI), not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 20 to 24 inches<br />Weight: 50 to 55 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Thick, coarse coat of medium length; colors vary and can include black, white, red, and tawny; dark eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Boerboel</h2><p>Boerboels are often mistaken for cane Corsos or a mastiff-type due to their large, muscular appearance and blocky head. Their looks are powerful and intimidating, but boerboels are gentle giants that are intelligent and loyal companions and are exceptionally great with kids. The breed came to fruition after interbreeding between European guard dogs, including bull and mastiff types and African bloodlines.

They are commonly found in Morocco, where it is still used for hunting. Sloughis are also used as guard dogs because of their aloofness towards strangers. But don't be fooled-sloughis are often affectionate among those they know, and they make lovely pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 29 inches<br />Weight: 35 to 50 pounds<br />Coat and Color: Short hair; smooth coat; dark eyes; coat color includes all shades of cream to red; coat may have brindle or black markings around the eyes or ears</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Basenji</h2><p>The Basenji may have a small and compact body, but that does not mean they aren't athletic.

A plus-Basenjis don't bark. Instead, they make yodeling noises that are less disruptive.

And while every dog has a unique personality, certain breeds tend to be a little more sociable than others.</p><p>Here are the 15 friendliest dog breeds that are eager to socialize with and please people.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Friendly dogs are adaptable to new situations and environments. They are easy to train and not terribly excitable all the time. When a dog gets overly excited, they're no longer attentive and become challenging to reign in. An active and playful dog is wonderful, but dogs need to understand limits and play without becoming too rough.</p><p>These 13 dog breeds are among the friendliest of human's best friends.</p><h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2><p>Corgis are known for being highly sociable dogs that love spending time with their families.

They are a very active breed, and if their energy gets pent up, they might engage in unwanted behaviors, such as excessive barking or chewing. So regular exercise is a necessity for an Irish setter.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, silky feathering and fringe; colors include red, chestnut, and mahogany</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Beagle</h2><p>Beagles are a cheerful breed that genuinely enjoys spending time with people.

They are constantly in tune with their humans, which helps them succeed in dog sports, such as agility and flying disc, and everyday training. But minimizing a border collie's desire to herd everything in sight is a must, as this can cause them to nip people.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Rough or smooth coat; can be solid, bicolor, tricolor, merle, or sable</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Boxer</h2><p>Boxers are suckers for attention.

They're intensely loyal to their humans, which, unfortunately, is why some are trained to fight. But many Staffordshire bull terriers that humans have hurt are still eager to love and trust.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 14 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 24 to 38 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat; colors include black, blue, brindle, fawn, white, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><p></p><h2>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h2><p>When it comes to Cavalier King Charles spaniels, their primary purpose throughout history has primarily been to serve as companion animals.

18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hot-weather-breeds-4777659,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>10 Dog Breeds That Thrive in Hot Weather</h1>,"<h1>10 Dog Breeds That Thrive in Hot Weather</h1><h2>Bring on the heat for these sunshine-loving canines</h2><p>Dogs are adaptable companions, but the climate in which you live can significantly impact how comfortable your pup will be daily. The best dogs for hot weather have the right kind of coat (or no fur at all!) and a body structure that is better suited for hot temperatures. It's not surprising that many of these breeds originated in warm climates with many generations of adaptation and selective breeding to suit their environment.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>A dog's build can tell you a lot about how well it can handle the heat. The most obvious is its coat. Just like a long, black fur coat worn by a person in midsummer seems unreasonable, the same can be said for a double-coated, dark-furred pooch. Dogs that fair best in warm temperatures have short hair, no hair, or a single coat-and it's usually a lighter color, like white, tan, or gray. Dogs with long noses are generally better suited for warmer temps.</p><p>These 12 dogs are the best dogs for hot weather, uniquely adapted for tropical temperatures.</p><h2>Chihuahua</h2><p>This pocket-sized pet is an adaptable dog breed that does well living in warm weather climates. The Chihuahua's thin coat and petite size don't provide much protection against the cold, so this breed tends to be more comfortable as the temperature rises. The breed originated in Mexico's hot desert, so they're no stranger to warm weather.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 to 6 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth coats or long coats; seen in many colors, either solid or a combination of two colors including black, tan, fawn, cream, white, blue, silver, chocolate, and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 20 years</p><h2>Australian Cattle Dog</h2><p></p><p>The dog from Down Under is an active, hearty breed with a drive to work despite the hot sun or warm temperatures. Australian cattle dogs have a short double coat that keeps the breed relatively cool during a long, hot day herding livestock and provides insulation and protection when nightly temperatures plummet. The breed is also called a ""blue heeler"" and is a highly active breed that loves to expend energy no matter the weather, making them an excellent medium-sized dog breed for hot weather.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, hard double coat; color is usually blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled; also comes in a less common red speckled variety</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Ibizan Hound</h2><p>This graceful and athletic dog breed was developed thousands of years ago in the Balearic islands, near Spain's coastline. They likely descended from Egyptian hounds brought by Phoenician traders. As sighthounds, they were bred to sprint in pursuit of prey under the hot sun. So the Ibizan hound is well-adapted for warm weather.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 28 inches (male); 22 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 50 pounds (male); 45 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coarse hair that can be smooth or wiry; comes in solid red, solid white, or white and red patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Afghan Hound</h2><p>These large dogs fare well in hot climates since those flowing locks are a single coat of hair. This breed's native homeland of Afghanistan is known for hot weather by day and cold temperatures by night. These dogs are no stranger to temperature extremes. The drawback: Be prepared to spend time regularly grooming the coat each week to keep it free of snarls and debris.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: About 50 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coat is long, thick, and fine; any color or combination of colors, including brindle and domino</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Yorkshire Terrier</h2><p>The silky coat of the Yorkshire terrier may be long, but it's fine. A thin texture means that it's not a great insulator against the cold. Additionally, its single coat is hair and not fur. As a result, it doesn't trap heat and will help these pint-sized pals stay cooler when the temperature rises. Smaller dogs can usually handle the heat a little better than larger ones.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, straight, and silky coat; standard color combinations are black and gold, black and tan, blue and gold, and blue and tan; puppies may not display their final coat color until age 3 or older</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 16 years</p><h2>Chinese Crested</h2><p>Chinese crested dogs are mainly hairless. They likely developed in Asia from imported hairless African dogs accustomed to hot temps. The exposed skin of a Chinese crested-or any hairless, short-haired, or sparsely haired dog-can quickly become sunburned. Use a sunscreen or take other precautions to protect your dog from the harmful effects of the sun.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Soft, silky hair only on the head, feet, and tail, the rest of its body is hairless with grayish-pink skin; a less famous coated ""powderpuff"" variety has a silky coat with white and gray coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 18 years</p><h2>Airedale Terrier</h2><p>The largest of the terrier breeds, the Airedale is a medium-sized dog that tolerates warm weather. These dogs have a fuzzy coat, but the hair is short and wiry. The lack of an undercoat allows for heat to escape, especially if you have the dog's coat stripped when the temperature rises.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat: Hard, wiry, dense, straight, short topcoat, with a softer undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: The head and ears are tan, and the body is a mix of tan and black or dark grizzle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2>Great Dane</h2><p>The Great Dane is one of the best large breed dogs for hot weather. With a natural tendency to conserve energy, these couch potatoes aren't likely to overexert themselves when the weather is warm. This breed tends to enjoy living in a warm-weather climate. However, if your dog has a darkly-colored coat, it can heat up quicker. Make sure your dog has shady spots to retreat from the sun and never leave them unattended long.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 28 to 32 inches</p><p>Weight: 110 to 175 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short hair in brindle, fawn, blue, black, harlequin (white with black patches), or mantle (black and white)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 8 years</p><h2>German Shorthaired Pointer</h2><p>For a hunting dog or active canine companion, even when the weather is warm, the German shorthaired pointer is an excellent choice. These dogs have short fur with no undercoat. They love to swim, so they won't hesitate to take a dip in a lake or pool to cool off. Keep a watchful eye on them and make sure they don't overexert themselves in extreme heat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 25 inches (male); 21 to 23 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds (male); 45 to 60 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, thin coat; commonly in solid liver or liver and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Italian Greyhound</h2><p>The slender frame and thin, short coat of the Italian greyhound don't protect against the wintery snow and ice; this is another excellent dog breed for warm weather. These dogs generally carry very little body fat and often need sweaters, coats, and more to combat cold weather. They feel much more comfortable in warm, sunny climates.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short and smooth</p><p>Coat Colors: Gray, black, fawn, chocolate, tan, cream, red, sable, or a combination</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 15 years</p>",1244

Look for a pup that needs minimal exercise, grooming, training, or infrequent health care needs.</p><p>These 9 low-maintenance dog breeds have qualities that make them ideal housemates for busy pet owners.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>The best dog breeds for busy people tend to have moderate to lower energy levels, average intelligence, and overall good health. Certain dog breeds tend to be ideal for a more sedentary lifestyle, such as middle-aged or senior dogs, although older dogs may eventually need more medical care.</p><h2>Dachshund</h2><p>The dachshund is a lovable and affectionate dog breed that makes a great couch buddy. This dog comes in two sizes: miniature and medium-sized. Long-haired doxies require a bit more grooming than the short-haired or wire-haired variety. All can make excellent companions.</p><p>Dachshunds have a stubborn side and will need basic training to give them structure. This breed usually only requires a moderate amount of exercise. With their short little legs and long bodies, excessive running and jumping can exacerbate or cause spinal issues.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8 to 9 inches (standard); 5 to 6 inches (miniature)</p><p>Weight: 16 to 32 pounds (standard); up to 11 pounds (miniature)</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Energetic, lovable, endearing personality</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Coat varieties include smooth (shorthaired), longhaired, and wire-haired; colors include (but not limited to) black, tan, fawn, beige, blue, chocolate, and red with various markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Greyhound</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, this racing dog is not a high-energy dog. Most greyhounds are couch potatoes that enjoy loafing around with their owners. They enjoy daily walks and the occasional chance to run, but they do not need a large amount of exercise.</p><p>Most greyhounds have overall good health. In general, greyhounds tend to be easy to handle and very responsive to training. This dog is large but not giant. If you appreciate its personality and looks but would prefer a smaller dog, consider a whippet.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 80 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Even-tempered, intelligent, affectionate</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: The coat is short and smooth in a variety of colors including black, blue, fawn, red, white, and various shades of brindle, or a combination of any of these colors</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 13 years</p><h2>French Bulldog</h2><p>The gleeful Frenchie makes the perfect loafing companion. French bulldogs are among the most cheerful of all dog breeds. Although they have a good deal of energy, they tend to lack endurance. Moderate daily exercise is usually suitable for this breed, though outdoor activities should be limited when it is very hot or humid.</p><p>Most Frenchies respond well to basic training and are generally well-behaved if provided with structure. This breed has minimal grooming needs but may have various skin issues, and due to its shortened muzzle, it has a high potential for brachycephalic syndrome.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 19 to 28 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Playful, friendly, loyal, affectionate, lively, sociable</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat in brindle, fawn, white, or combination of brindle and white or fawn and white</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Chihuahua</h2><p>Leaning towards a tiny dog? Weighing in at just 2 to 6 pounds, the itty bitty Chihuahua is the perfect pocket-sized lap dog. Although these dogs do get bursts of energy, they generally do not need a lot of exercise.</p><p>Most Chihuahuas are relatively healthy. Grooming needs are minimal, but long-haired Chihuahuas will need a bit more brushing to avoid tangles. One thing to watch out for is this breed's attitude.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 to 6 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Loyal, alert, lively, attentive, bright, companionable</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth or long coats come in black, tan, fawn, cream, white, blue, silver, chocolate, and red</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 20 years</p><h2>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h2><p>If you want a dog that will look like a puppy forever, the Cavalier is a mild-mannered, gentle, affectionate, and adaptable dog. This dog is small- to medium-sized and is often happiest when snuggling with a human or another dog. Cavaliers generally weigh about 11 to 18 pounds and are easy to handle and train. They are predisposed to some health problems like heart disease, ear infections, and neurological issues.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 12 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 18 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Affectionate, active, family-friendly</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, sleek and silky coat with feathering around ears, feet, chest, and tail in four color varieties: tricolor, blenheim, ruby, and black and tan</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>West Highland White Terrier</h2><p>If you're considering a small- to medium-sized dog for your new easygoing companion, a Westie makes an excellent pet. Most are moderately energetic, easy to train, and relatively healthy.</p><p>This breed requires some grooming but does not need trimming regularly. Many people choose to hand-strip the coat of this dog (pluck the dead hairs), while others brush periodically to keep the coat healthy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 20 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Upbeat, loveable, active</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Completely white, long rough coat; black eyes, and nose</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Brussels Griffon</h2><p>Small, cute, and goofy, the Brussels griffon is a delightful dog to know. Though they can be a bit energetic, they do not need a lot of exercise. Basic training is essential to offset their feisty side and provide structure.</p><p>At 6 to 12 pounds, the Brussels is another small breed with no more than moderate grooming needs. The wiry coat requires some brushing, but extensive grooming is not necessary. Also, the breed is relatively healthy and well-mannered.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 7 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Lively, joyful, loyal</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth coat or rough coat in red, black and tan, solid black, or belge (mix of black and reddish-brown)</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Mastiff</h2><p>Got your heart set on a giant couch potato dog? Mastiffs are immense dogs that tend to have a relatively low energy level and not much endurance. Younger mastiffs tend to be a bit goofy and playful and are usually very docile. As they age, they become lazier and more aloof but remain affectionate towards their families.</p><p>Like most giant dog breeds, a downside is these dogs have a shorter lifespan than the average dog. Most are considered seniors by age 6, and not many will live past the age of 11 to 12 years. Aside from the orthopedic problems that affect some mastiffs, these dogs tend to be reasonably healthy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 27 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 120 to 220 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Noble, gentle, and loyal</p><p>Energy Level: Low</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and sleek coat colored fawn, apricot, or brindle with a dark mask on the muzzle, ears, nose, and drooping jowls</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Bullmastiff</h2><p>If you want a large dog that is not quite as giant and lazy as the mastiff, then the bullmastiff sounds about right. Weighing 100 pounds to 130 pounds, it is still a large dog. Health is similar to the mastiff (or better), and its lifespan is a bit longer. The bullmastiff has a little bit more energy than the mastiff but not much endurance. Daily walks should be enough to keep this breed happy and healthy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 100 to 130 pounds</p><p>Personality/Temperament: Loyal, protective, alert, loving, companionable, calm</p><p>Energy Level: Medium</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat in fawn, reddish-brown, or brindle coloring with a dark-colored muzzle, nose, and drooping jowls</p><p>Life Span: 8 to 10 years</p>",1250
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-wolfdogs-1237356,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>Should You Keep a Wolf Dog as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Wolf Dog as a Pet?</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>A wolf dog is a cross between a domesticated dog and a wolf. This large animal is a controversial pet that may make a great companion for one person but be troublesome-or even dangerous-for another. Wolf dogs retain much of the instinctive behavior of their wild relatives. They are headstrong and aggressive, and they can be downright ferocious. Feeding these pets is also a challenge: they need pounds of raw meat per day.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name Wolf dog</p><p>Scientific Name No official term; (common domestic dog)is interbred with one of these wild species: , , or</p><p>Adult Size 25 to 33 inches, 60 to 120 pounds</p><p>Lifespan 13 to 16 years</p><h2>Can You Own a Wolf Dog?</h2><h3>Legality</h3><p>The legality of owning a wolf dog is convoluted at best. There are no consistent nationwide laws as the U.S. government basically leaves such regulations up to individual states, which often defer to even more localized units of government at the county and city levels. Certain permits and enclosure requirements may be necessary to keep a wolf dog as a pet. It's best to check with your state's various regulatory agencies before looking into buying a wolf dog.</p><h3>Ethics</h3><p>Ethically, owning a wolf dog is a subject full of contention. Some people believe that wolf dogs are enough like domestic dogs to be owned in the same way. Others feel that the wolf dog's wild genetics make it more feral than tame and should not be kept in captivity for the safety of both the animal and the people who interact with it.</p><h3>Things to Consider</h3><p>Wolf dogs are not exactly like domestic dogs-especially the common companion breeds. They are large, intelligent canines that can bond intensely to their human owners and act aggressively in protection of their owners or their home. Wolf dogs need a lot of exercise and room to roam, so they do not fare well confined to homes or small yards. If left alone regularly, they may become bored, depressed, and destructive to property. They may also try to escape confinement by leaping ordinary fences, and a loose wolf dog is a potential threat to unfamiliar adults and children. These factors must be considered as owning a wolf dog is a much more serious responsibility than keeping a poodle as a pet.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Unique and Intelligent Wolf Dog</h3><h2>Wold Dog Behavior and Temperament</h2><p>Despite the fact that wolf dogs are mostly dogs, ownership requires extensive experience, as this canine crossbreed has characteristics that can make it a challenging addition to a family. Some wolf dogs are more like wolves than they are like dogs, and their temperament can differ greatly from that of a Siberian husky or an Alaskan malamute.</p><p>Wolf dogs, in general, are not easygoing pets and they have the capacity to be quite aggressive. This means they are probably not a good choice for a family with small children or family members who are not able to control an aggressive pet. Wolf dogs also differ greatly from one to the next; while some are lovely pets, others are extremely difficult to care for in a home setting.</p><p>Generally speaking, the more wolf in the mix, the more feral this dog will act. This wildness will also depend on the number of generations that your wolf dog is away from its first breeding. Wolves are not domesticated, so deliberate socialization and training of wolf breeds are needed to assure their integration into the civilized world. In addition, wolves are pack animals with a natural instinct to guard their food and mark their territory-useful traits in the wild, but highly undesirable in the home.</p><p>Still, for the right owner, they can be a delightful companion.</p><h2>Housing</h2><p>Wolf dogs can live in a house with their owners, much like domestic dogs, but they can't be expected to stay inside alone for long periods of time. Wolf dogs tend to be destructive, especially when confined to the house alone, stemming from their high energy level, need for mental and physical challenges, and natural tendency to dig. They're also escape artists, making them suitable only for owners who have adequate time to spend with them and proper fencing. If you work away from home every day, a wolf dog may not be the right pet. If you are often home or can take your wolf dog with you wherever you go, you may find a wolf dog to be a great companion.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Wolf dogs are prone to the same problems as those experienced by domestic dogs. Be sure you have access to a local vet who is willing and able to work with your pet, as some will not work with wolf dogs (particularly if they are owned illegally). Your wolf dog will need vaccinations as a puppy and should be monitored and provided with appropriate vaccines and medications throughout its life.</p><p>No licensed vaccines exist for wolf dogs but the off-label use of domestic canine vaccinations are often recommended by veterinarians and wolf dog advocates. It is important to note, however, that if a wolf dog bites someone-vaccinated or not-the government will treat that animal as though it was unvaccinated (often leading to euthanasia).</p><h2>What Does a Wolf Dog Eat and Drink?</h2><p>Wolf dogs do not thrive on typical dog food. In essence, they need to eat what wild wolves eat: raw meat. Ideally, you should feed your wolf dog several pounds of raw meat per day. It's fine to feed them chicken and turkey, but avoid raw pork as it can cause digestive issues. Bones are not an issue for wolf dogs, and they will enjoy and benefit from eating raw, whole bones. In addition, a wolf dog will need access to fresh grass and other vegetation, and many wolf dogs enjoy fruit, although you should check with your vet to see that the fruit you offer is safe for your pet.</p><p>In addition to regular meals, most wolf dogs benefit from nutritional supplements including glucosamine, vitamins C, A, B, D, and E, along with alfalfa and wheatgrass, garlic, and pumpkin. These supplements help to lower the risk of acquiring common health issues such as arthritis, skin issues, parasites, and digestive problems.</p><p>Wolf dogs need a constant source of fresh water. The best option is to provide water in a trough that is used for livestock. In hot areas, you can offer your wolf dog the option of actually bathing in cool water in a wading pool.</p><h2>Exercise</h2><p>Wolf dogs require an enormous amount of exercise-three to four hours per day-and will have health issues if confined to a house.</p><h2>Training</h2><p>Wolf dogs benefit from exposure to lots of different people, locations, and situations as pups to prevent them from being skittish and potentially fearful, which can lead to biting. However, training, in general, poses significant challenges: Wolf dogs are not as eager to please their trainer as a domestic dog that is bred and raised to do so. Nor are they good indoor pets. Not only are male and female wolf dogs likely to mark furniture with urine, but they may destroy property when bored by digging or chewing. Wolf dogs also pose a risk to children and other pets because their protective instinct for their primary owner may lead to aggressive behavior (growling, biting) toward other members of the household. Hormone changes at sexual maturity can add another layer to a wolf dog's unpredictability, although spaying or neutering a wolf dog may tame some of its wild instincts.</p>",1244

Dogs have been woven in cultural stories, found in artworks, and skeletal remains from Chinese archaeological digs. They have been used as guardians, hauling, herding, hunting, and regal companions from the time they were domesticated.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>The breeds span all different body types and sizes and are as unique as the varied regions of China, from the colder mountain zone to the tropical, coastal areas. It is believed that the emperors and nobles greatly appreciated the flat-faced look; hence many-although not all-have shorter snouts and folds in their faces. Flattened faces gave the dogs almost a ""lion dog"" appearance, an important symbol of protection in Chinese lore. Another unique quality-the shar-pei, chow chow, and Chongqing dogs have blue-black tongues-a rare quality in dogs.</p><h2>Pugs</h2><p>Pugs are one of the most popular family dog breeds due to their sweet, friendly demeanor and manageable size. They're also one of the world's oldest breeds. The pug likely originated in China around 400 B.C. as a Tibetan Buddhist monk companion. Hypotheses swirl tying pugs to Tibetan mastiffs while others claim it's related to the Pekingese, another Chinese dog hailing from China. Formerly a mischievous companion of emperors, this comical, loving pup warms hearts everywhere it goes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 18 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coats that typically come in fawn or black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Pekingese</h2><p>Also called ""Pekes,"" ""lion dogs,"" or ""sun dogs,"" Pekingese were initially kept as companion pets to Chinese royalty and were ingrained in Chinese folklore. One story says that Pekingese were created when Buddha shrunk a lion down to the size of a small dog. In reality, Pekingese were most likely the result of breeding a larger dog with toy-sized dogs in China. They were a favorite-and much looked-after-pet among Chinese royalty for thousands of years.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: Up to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, thick double coat with a lion-like mane in gold, sable, or red, gray, black, tan, and cream</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Shih Tzus</h2><p>The shih tzu, a small toy dog with a playful personality, is named for its lion-like appearance. Its name comes from the word ""lion"" in Chinese. Like the Pekingese and pugs, Shih Tzus were treasured by Chinese nobility for centuries and were considered the noble dog of China. The shih tzu can be traced back to ancient dog breeds but are more closely related to wolves than other dog breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 16 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, double coat that comes in numerous color variations, most commonly in black, white, blue, gold, or liver</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 16 years</p><h2>Shar-Peis</h2><p>Known for their distinctive, wrinkled faces, petite ears, and blue-black tongues, shar-peis are a unique and rare breed with roots in ancient China. Shar-peis, meaning ""sand skin,"" were initially bred as hunting and guard dogs 2,000 years ago in southern China. Sadly, during China's communist revolution in the mid-1900s, shar-pei populations were decimated, almost making the breed extinct. Sometime during the 1970s, a Chinese shar-pei enthusiast rallied American breeders to propagate the breed, and numbers rose once again.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 18 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, bristle coat, commonly in black, chocolate, blue, and cream</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 12 years</p><h2>Chow Chow</h2><p>Chow chows are among the most ancient Chinese dog breeds, with evidence dating back to 206 B.C. They were originally employed as hunting and guard dogs. Like the shar-pei, chows have a very distinctive appearance: Their faces are somewhat bear-like with deep facial folds and a blue-black tongue.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coats can be rough or smooth in black, blue, cinnamon, cream, or red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Chinese Crested</h2><p>Because the Chinese crested has extremely early origins, no one is exactly sure when or how the breed was developed. Some assume that hairless dogs from Africa were brought to China and bred with smaller, toy-sized dogs to give the crested its unique, hairless appearance. Chinese crested dogs were popular for use on Chinese trading vessels to hunt vermin.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Soft, silky hair only on the head, feet, and tail, the rest of its body is hairless with grayish-pink skin; a less famous coated ""powederpuff"" variety has a silky coat with white and gray coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 18 years</p><h2>Xiasi</h2><p>LauraKelsch / Wikimedia Commons / Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</p><p>The Xiasi, pronounced ""she-ah-seh"" is a lean, muscular hunting dog that originated in the Guizhou region of China, sometime around 1080.

It is sometimes called the Chinese German shepherd. Like German shepherds, Kunming wolfdogs are trained as military assistance dogs, fire dogs, and search-and-rescue. Named after the capital city of the Yunnan province, they're also a popular family dog throughout China.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 85 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, double coat that comes in black, brown, rust, cream, and other color variations</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Japanese Chin</h2><p>Despite its name, the Japanese chin is believed to have originated in China. Closely related to Tibetan spaniels, they were likely a gift from the Chinese emperor to Japanese royalty. Known for their cat-like, calm, and affectionate behavior, the Japanese chin became extremely popular among Japanese nobility over 1,000 years ago. Later, when Japan began to trade with other countries, the Japanese chin was a traditional gift to naval officers or sold to traders and sailors.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 9 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long and silky coats in black and white, lemon and white, sable and white, black, and other color variations</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>Formosan Mountain Dog (Taiwan Dogs)</h2><p>Formosan mountain dogs or Taiwan dogs have been genetically traced to 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, making them one of the oldest and most primitive dog breeds in the world. The Formosan mountain dog is a small- to medium-sized dog that hails from south Asian dog stock in the Taiwanese mountains. Although Formosan mountain dogs were considered wild, they're now domesticated as hunting dogs, guard dogs, rescue dogs, and family dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Primitive, hunting dog (FCI), not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 13 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and smooth coats in black, fawn, brindle, white, and combinations of these colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 13 years</p><h2>Chinese Imperial</h2><p>Closely related to the shih tzu, the Chinese imperial dog is also known as a teacup or micro shih tzu. It is considered by many to be a separate Chinese breed, although not by the AKC, which calls it a smaller shih tzu. As its name implies, this was another small companion dog kept by dynastic Chinese emperors.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 7 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Luxurious, long dense coat with a fluffy and curly tail in fawn, brown, silver, white, black, pied</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p>",1264

No matter their coat or color, their personalities vary. Some may stick close to the general description of the breed's disposition, but it depends most on the individual dog's upbringing and demeanor.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>According to some shelters and breeders, with dogs of the same breed or litter that come in black and other colors, such as poodles, the black-coated dogs tend to be friendlier. Some suggest that black dogs fail to get adopted or are adopted last compared to other colored dogs. This dog adoption issue is also known as ""black dog syndrome"" and is based on anecdotes and supposition.</p><p>Here are 10 of the most common black dog breeds.</p><h2>Affenpinscher</h2><p>The American Kennel Club classifies the affenpinscher as a toy group dog for its small 10-pound size and 11-inch stature. It was bred to dispatch rats and other vermin. Affenpinscher is German for monkey terrier,"" which is understandable once you see their adorable pushed-in face. Affenpinschers have strong, bold temperaments and are charming and entertaining companions. Their wiry coat requires biweekly brushing to prevent mats and needs trimming every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 11.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Wiry and shaggy coat; commonly comes in black and can come in gray, silver, red, black and tan, or beige</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Belgian Sheepdog</h2><p>Intelligent and watchful, the beautiful Belgian sheepdog is also named the Groenendael for a place in Brussels. Of the four related Belgian sheepherding breeds (the others are the Belgian Malinois, the Belgian Laekenois, and the Belgian Tervuren), the Belgian sheepdog is the only one that solely comes in black. Known as workaholics,&rdquo;</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 45 to 75 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat is always black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Black Russian Terrier</h2><p>The black Russian terrier looks like a giant schnauzer, with a similar body outline, plus a long beard and mustache. This breed only comes in black and is affectionately called a ""blackie"" for short. The schnauzer breed was used (among others) to develop the black Russian terrier. If you stand the two side by side, the massive black Russian terrier is more than twice the size of the giant schnauzer. This working dog requires an expert owner used to training powerful, strong-willed dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 26 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 100 to 150 pounds (male); 80 to 120 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length double coat is always black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Flat-Coated Retriever</h2><p>Bouncy, silly, and fun-loving, the flat-coated retriever is often mistaken for a black-coated golden retriever, a more familiar breed. Flat-coated retrievers are more active and athletic and require more exercise. The breed's lustrous, straight coat lies flat against its body (hence its name). The flat-coated retriever comes in two solid colors: black and liver (chocolate brown), although black is far more common.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 24.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Moderate length coat that lies flat; comes in solid black or brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><p>The Labrador retriever has held the No. 1 spot as the most popular dog breed in the United States for nearly three decades. Friendly and trainable, Labs are known to be excellent dogs for families. The short coat is water-resistant and sheds heavily, so frequent brushing will cut down on hair lying around the house. This sporting dog needs lots of exercise daily, preferably off-leash running or games of fetch.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 24.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense double coat comes in black, chocolate, or yellow</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Newfoundland</h2><p>The majestic Newfoundland is massive but also known as a gentle giant that is usually great with children. A working dog, Newfies were used by Canadian fishermen to perform water rescues in icy waters. Newfoundlands were well-suited to the task, with a heavy, water-resistant coat, muscular, strong bodies, and webbed feet. The Newfie is also an all-purpose worker on land, pulling carts and guarding the home. The thick, double coat requires brushing several times a week to prevent mats. Also, be prepared for a bit of slobber. Their coat most commonly comes in black, although they also come in brown, gray, or black and white.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 26 to 28 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 100 to 150 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Large and heavily boned, but well balanced; in addition to black, Newfies come in brown, gray, or black and white (called Landseer)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 10 years</p><h2>Pug</h2><p>A pug's most important job is to be a loving and loyal canine companion. This toy group dog is most commonly seen sporting a tan- or fawn-colored coat with a black mask and ears, but they also come in solid black. The pug's breed standard uses the Latin phrase which means a lot in a little.&rdquo; The phrase perfectly describes the solidly built, lively pug in both body and personality. Its short coat sheds a lot, so frequent brushing is a must.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 18 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, short double coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Puli</h2><p>The medium-sized puli is compact and square with a long, shaggy coat that naturally forms cords in adults. This herding dog herded sheep in Hungary. The unique corded coat protected this breed from the cold weather and also served as armor against flock predators like wolves. The puli is vigorous, alert, and active, and it needs abundant exercise to remain happy. If you don't want to maintain the dreadlocks (which is a lot of work), its coat can be trimmed in a low-maintenance short style. This breed always has a solid colored coat; it's usually black, although it can also have a gray or white coat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Weight: 25 to 35 pounds</p><p>Height: 16 to 17 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Wooly, dense double coat in solid black, rusty black, gray, or white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Schipperke</h2><p>Schipperkes worked as ratters and watchdogs on and around ships and barges in Belgium as far back as Medieval times. The breed name means little captain&rdquo; in Flemish. These charming and feisty little dogs are usually solid jet black with twinkling, dark-brown eyes. It can also come in cream, ivory, wheaten, gold, red, white, blue, and chocolate, although it's rare. The schipperke is small but has the energy to spare and loves to accompany their favorite people on all their adventures. Excellent watchdogs, schipperkes are wary of strangers and protective of their homes and people.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Weight: 10 to 16 pounds</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Abundant coat, straight and slightly harsh to the touch; usually black although other colors can occur</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Scottish Terrier</h2><p>Although almost everyone who pictures a Scottish Terrier thinks of a black dog, they also come in wheaten (a yellow shade) or brindle (tiger stripes). With short legs and long, substantial bodies, Scotties were well-suited to dispatching rats and hunting foxes and badgers in the Scottish Highlands. Today's Scottie is still happy to take care of pesky rodents, and like other terriers, Scotties are incredibly bold and feisty, especially with other dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 18 to 22 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Double coat with longer fur on the face, legs, and lower body and soft, dense undercoat; most commonly black but can also appear in wheaten or brindle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p>",1269

Maybe they have facial hair that gives them a distinctive characterful appearance.</p><p>When considering offering a home to a dog, it's important to also take into account the dog's temperament too. Don't forget that bearded dogs often have more intensive grooming requirements too. These dogs with beards all have their own unique charms and challenges.</p><h2>Airedale Terrier</h2><p>The Airedale Terrier is often referred to as the 'King of Terriers'. This is, in part, due to their size-they're the largest of all the terrier breeds. It's also due to their regal look and temperament. These dogs are incredibly smart, adaptable, have a bucket load of energy and stamina, and they're full of character.</p><p>Their strong personality means a novice dog owner may find an Airedale a challenge. They can be independent and might have a stubborn streak; you're certainly not going to have an obliging lap dog in this dog.</p><p>Like many terriers, Airedales have a strong prey drive and you may need to work hard on training a solid recall. It also means they won't be best suited for a household with other small furries, unless they are raised together from a young age.</p><p>An Airedales hard, wiry and dense topcoat isn't difficult to maintain, although their coat will need regular stripping and/or grooming, to prevent it from looking too unruly. They also grow more hair around their muzzle, giving them a very distinct beard. Be prepared for this absorbing lots of water and muck. It may need a good clean and dry off after a wet walk, or even a drink of water!</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Hard, wiry, dense, short topcoat, with a softer undercoat; head and ears are tan, and the body is a mix of tan and black or dark grizzle; distinctive beard, and they are the largest of the terrier breeds.</p><h2>Miniature Schnauzer</h2><p>When you think of dogs with beards, the Miniature Schnauzer might be the breed that springs to many people's minds. They commonly come in salt and pepper coloring and, with their profuse and distinctive eyebrows and beards, they have a bit of an 'old man' look that many breed enthusiasts fall in love with.</p><p>These adaptable little dogs tend to settle just as well in an apartment, providing they get enough exercise, as they will living on a farm. They enjoy spending time around their people and, with the right introductions, can get on well with other dogs. Because of their ratting background, however, they can have the drive to chase after small furries.</p><p>One thing you may have to work on more than anything else is training to make sure their barking doesn't get out of control. They're notoriously vocal and can be prolific alert barkers. Mini Schnauzers, with their wiry topcoat, they shed very little, and their grooming regime isn't intensive. Their coat will need to be clipped every 2 months to prevent it from getting unruly, and you may even need to trim their eyebrows and beard more frequently too.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 19 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short, wiry topcoat and soft undercoat; most commonly seen in salt and pepper but can also be found in black and silver and solid black; old man appearance because of the longer hairs that grow on their face, particularly their eyebrows and beard</p><h2>Brussels Griffon</h2><p>Brussels Griffons stand out because of their beards, which can sometimes reach epic proportions, but they're also little dogs full of character and charm.</p><p>The breed is native to Belgium, where they were originally developed as expert ratters for the stables of coachmen. Their personalities and unique appearance soon caught the eyes of the aristocracy, and their popularity grew when Queen Marie Henrietta of Belgium started to breed them.</p><p>When it comes to strangers and boisterous children, Griffs aren't always the most tolerant due to their small size and reserved temperaments. This means they aren't necessarily suited to a home with young kids, and they will need plenty of socialization and gentle training to ensure they don't become nervous or reactive when they meet new people.</p><p>Aside from trimming and cleaning of that profuse beard, your Brussels Griffon won't have a high maintenance grooming regime but their needs vary if they are smooth-coated or rough-coated.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Smooth coat or rough coat in red, black and tan, solid black, or belge (mix of black and reddish brown); distinctive black muzzle and beard</p><h2>Scottish Terrier</h2><p>The Scottish Terrier has, perhaps, one of the most well-known dog silhouettes around. With their long nose, full skirt on their body, and a prominent beard, they are recognized the world over.</p><p>Be prepared to put the work in when it comes to training a Scottie. They can be very strong-willed, independent and tenacious. They won't respond well to you trying to force them to do something they don't want to. If you're patient, keep sessions short to prevent your Scottie getting bored, and use positive reinforcement training techniques, you may be surprised by how quickly they pick things up. This breed is smart; it's just they often choose to do things their way!</p><p>Scotties tend to be unfailingly loyal to their family and will form strong attachments, but this doesn't mean they're a lapdog. They tend to be free-spirited and will usually look for attention on their own terms.</p><p>If you keep your Scottie's coat in the longer style, with a full skirt, you'll need to adopt a regular grooming regime to prevent knots or mats developing. They will also need clipping or hand-stripping periodically, as the coat grows continually and at a relatively fast rate. Some owners elect to keep the coat short for lower maintenance and this requires grooming every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 19 to 22 pounds (males); 18 to 21 pounds (females)</p><p>Physical Characteristics: A short, sturdy little dog with a long face and pronounced eyebrows and beard; hard, wiry outer coat that forms into a long skirt on the body when left untrimmed; most commonly found in black coloring, but they also come in wheaten and brindle</p><h2>Bearded Collie</h2><p>We couldn't leave the breed that is affectionately known as the 'Beardie' off this list. Their beard is perhaps less distinct than some of the other breeds featured here, blending in with the overall long hair across their face, but it's there nonetheless.</p><p>Unlike some of the other popular Collie breeds, like the Border Collie or the Australian Cattle Dog, the working drive is less intense in this breed, making them less of a challenge as a family pet. Beardies are known for being exceptionally friendly with people and other dogs</p><p>Bearded Collies can also have a stubborn streak that means that, even though they're intelligent, you may need to be a bit more patient when it comes to training. You'll also need to change it up as they can get bored quickly too.</p><p>Of all the dogs featured on this list, the Beardie is the one with the most intensive grooming requirements. Don't consider this breed unless you're prepared to devote the time to this. If neglected, their coat can quickly become tangled and matted.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 20 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 55 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: This medium-sized breed has a distinctive shaggy look; long, coarse topcoat; colors include white with red, brown or brindle markings; a black ""mask"" is typically seen</p>",1244

Nine Hungarian breeds fall into three primary types: guard dogs, hunting dogs, and sheepherding dogs. There are obvious differences in purpose, size, body type, and coat; for instance, the sleek and athletic vizsla stands in stark contrast to the mop-like, sheep-mimicking appearance of the Komondor and the puli.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>As a group, these Hungarian dog breeds are noted for having a courageous and even-tempered disposition. Each is a high-performance working dog, requiring a routine exercise schedule to unleash their energy. They are brilliant, persistent, and adaptable.</p><p>Here are nine Hungarian dogs with a devoted following, although some are rarely seen outside of Hungary.</p><h2>Vizsla</h2><p>The most popular of the nine Hungarian dog breeds, you may recognize the vizsla without realizing it hails from Hungary. Originally bred to be a capable companion for hunters, the vizsla has an athletic build and instinctive tendency towards pointing and retrieving.</p><p>These dogs date back centuries; the early Magyar clans of Hungary are credited with the breed's development. These dogs are high-energy and do best in an active household. They're well-suited for many different types of canine competitions and make an outstanding running partner.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Copper or rust-colored short, smooth, dense coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Wirehaired Vizsla</h2><p>The most recently developed Hungarian dog breed, the wirehaired vizsla, is similar to the typical vizsla in temperament and stature but with a wiry coat and heavier bone structure. The breed results from selective cross-breeding between the vizsla and the German wirehaired pointer in the 1930s.</p><p>Its wiry coat and more robust build offer hunters a retriever that was better built for trudging up Hungarian hills and combating bramble and undergrowth in pursuit of quarry. Today, the wirehaired vizsla's bushy beard and expressive eyebrows set it apart from its smooth-coated cousin.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 25 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Wiry, close-lying coat; in varying shades of solid golden rust</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Komondor</h2><p>While the vizsla may be the most popular Hungarian dog breed, the Komondor is undoubtedly the most striking. With an abundance of corded fur-often likened to dreadlocks-the Komondor commands attention. The noble disposition of this breed has earned it the title, the king of dogs, the dog of kings.&rdquo;</p><p>The Komondor's chief occupation in its Hungarian homeland was to guard flocks of sheep. Its resemblance to the fleecy creatures made it the perfect undercover guard dog. This occupation required a calm, sedate presence coupled with a readiness for action at the first hint of danger to the flock. The Komondor retains this persona and makes a calm household pet but a fierce guardian if a threat is detected.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 26 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 80 pounds and up</p><p>Coat and Color: White corded coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Kuvasz</h2><p>Also known as kuvs, this is a working Hungarian dog breed. The earliest origins of the kuvasz may have been in Tibet or even Siberia, but this breed gained popularity in Hungary in the Middle Ages. Known for having a steady nature coupled with large size, they made excellent watchdogs for livestock and property and became versatile farm dogs.</p><p>The kuvasz gained AKC recognition in 2003, about 70 years after being imported into the United States. Today the breed is prevalent in its native Hungarian homeland but is still rare in the United States.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 26 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 115 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: White, thick double coat usually medium in length, ranges from straight to wavy</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Puli</h2><p></p><p>Commonly thought to be the oldest of the three Hungarian sheepdogs, the puli is smaller than the Komondor but shares a similar corded coat, along with a solid guarding disposition coupled with a family-friendly attitude. If you have more than one puli, then the plural of this dog breed is pulik.</p><p>Like some of the other Hungarian dog breeds, the Magyar people are thought to have introduced the puli to Hungary centuries ago. Later, the slightly smaller pumi was derived from the tried-and-true puli. The puli gained AKC recognition in the 1930s and has become a rare but beloved companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 35 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and glossy naturally corded coat; solid colors, such as black, rusty black, gray, or white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Pumi</h2><p>One of the three Hungarian sheepdog breeds, the pumi is believed to have been developed from the older puli breed. The most distinctive feature of the pumi is their folded but upright ears. They give a characteristically alert and happy appearance, which is typical of the pumi's bright disposition.</p><p>The pumi is the Hungarian dog breed most recently recognized by the AKC-achieving full breed recognition in the herding group in 2016. These dogs stand less than 20 inches high and typically weigh no more than 30 pounds, but they can command a flock of sheep with ease and make excellent herders.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15 to 18.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 22 to 29 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Compact body with semi-erect ears and a tail that curls over the back; wavy, curly coat in black, white, gray, or fawn</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Mudi</h2><p>If you combine a puli and a pumi on a rainy day, you get a mudi. Well, it's not exactly that simple. But the reality is that interbreeding between two of Hungary's smaller sheepdogs, perhaps along with the influence of German spitz-type dogs, produced the Hungarian dog breed known as the mudi.</p><p>The mudi is considerably rarer than the puli or pumi, but it gained FCI recognition back in 1966. In addition, the breed was added to the AKC's Foundation Stock Service in 2004. Mudis lack the cords or tight curls of the pumi and puli breeds but have a surprising feature-they carry the gene for merle-colored coats. Mudis come in solid colors like black, brown, grey, and white, along with eye-catching merle patterns. Interestingly, they are the only herding breed within the AKC with the merle gene and produce healthy solid white dogs (many other merle carriers born solid white due to a double merle cross are born blind or deaf).</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15 to 18.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 18 to 29 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short to medium-length coat that is wavy to curly; colors include black, brown, gray, gray-brown, white, merle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Hungarian Greyhound (Magyar Agar)</h2><p>The Hungarian sighthound, also known as an agar, looks like a more robust greyhound but is a breed all its own. Agar means gazehound or windhound in Hungarian. They have an ancient history along with the Magyar people that settled Hungry in the late 9th century.</p><p>The Hungarian sighthound's larger bone structure and thicker skin with shorter muzzle were suited for the hilly terrain of Hungary. Early hunters on horseback used these hounds in pursuit of game, primarily hare and deer. The Hungarian sighthound isn't well-known today and currently doesn't have AKC recognition. However, the breed is recognized by Britain's United Kennel Club, the FCI, and the American Rare Breed Association.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sighthound (UKC and FCI); not AKC-recognized</p><p>Height: 24.5 to 27.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, straight coat in many colors including black, fawn, red, brindle, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p>",1237

Of course, every dog is an individual-so a type of breed as a predictor of playfulness is only one part of the equation. Breed type only increases your probability. Nurture your dog to play with you, and it likely will.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>A playful dog is a dog with tons of energy. If a dog gets plenty of exercise and is well balanced, it's not depressed or anxious; it's exuberant and eager to please you. Dogs at play are usually well trained, good at recall, and easygoing when socializing with other dogs and people.</p><p>Here are 10 of the most exuberant dog breeds that make perfect playmate pups.</p><h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><p>Labrador retrievers are large, goofy dogs that love anything to do with playing. They often love a game of fetch and splashing around in the water. The breed is originally from Newfoundland, bred from a water dog, and was eventually brought to England to work as waterfowl retrievers. They were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1917, quickly stealing the hearts of dog lovers across the nation.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 24.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense double coat in black, chocolate, or yellow</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Boxer</h2><p></p><p>Muscular and athletic, boxers have a storied history as fighting dogs but have also been lauded for their bravery, intelligence, and loyalty. Working as hunting or guarding dogs, these intelligent canines were also used as couriers. Boxers are a widely sought-after family pet. They love to play, especially with their family. Their generally happy disposition and energetic personality make them a good choice for an active home. These rambunctious dogs are not the best suited for a home with infants or toddlers since they can get overexcited sometimes and knock down new walkers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 25 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: The coat is short; fawn and brindle are the standard colors, while all-white is typically not recognized by many kennel clubs</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Golden Retriever</h2><p>No breed probably typifies an American family dog more than a golden retriever. Big, beautiful golden retrievers have long, flowing blonde or honey-colored fur. They are loyal and intelligent but also goofy and lively. Similar to Labs, they enjoy water play, fetch, and accompanying you everywhere. They are great companions for humans of all ages and get along with most other animals.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length double coat in light to dark gold</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Pomeranian</h2><p></p><p>This spitz breed is descended from sled dogs in Iceland and Lapland and is distantly related to big Malamutes and Samoyeds. Queen Victoria had Poms in the late 1800s, which helped them gain popularity in Europe and beyond. If you're considering a small playful dog, put Pomeranians on your shortlist. Poms are fun-loving, affectionate pups in a small, fluffy package, although they can have a stubborn streak.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, double coat that comes in many colors, though the most common are red, orange, cream, sable, black, brown, and blue</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Australian Shepherd</h2><p>Australian shepherds or Aussies are one of the most athletic dog breeds. These dogs love to run, jump, and play whenever they get the chance. They are exceptionally skilled at agility and playing frisbee, but their innate value lies in herding. Aussies were developed in the United States, where ranchers bred them as livestock herders and farmworkers. The medium-sized Aussie also comes in a smaller size-miniature American shepherds. Be prepared to give this dog a lot of physical and mental stimulation; it will need it for a balanced life.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 18 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium to long coat in blue merle, red merle, black, or red; all colors may have white markings and/or tan (copper) points</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>English Springer Spaniel</h2><p>The English springer spaniel first became popular in Europe in the early 1900s, making its way to America a few years later. Year after year, it's listed in the top 30 most popular list in the U.S., according to the American Kennel Club. Friendly, fun, and intelligent, the ESS is a well-rounded breed well suited for an active family. They tend to be kid and pet-friendly and extremely affectionate but be prepared for their high energy level. They're also prone to separation anxiety.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 19 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length flat or wavy, glossy topcoat, and a short, profuse and soft undercoat; ears, legs, and chest often have longer feathering; black or liver with white markings, or the opposite; blue or liver roan are also common; tricolor, which includes black, white and liver or tan markings, can sometimes occur</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2><p>Pembroke Welsh Corgis are a favorite breed of Queen Elizabeth II. Corgis are small, but they don't act like it. They are short and stout herding dogs with large bunny-like ears and a short and stubby tail. Corgis are intelligent, active, and loyal dogs that make excellent companions and playmates. This breed can be prone to weight gain and consequent back problems. Keep them engaged with lots of games of fetch.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 24 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium length double coat in black and tan, red, sable, or fawn; all colors are typically seen with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>The Jack Russell terrier originated in England in the 1800s in response to a need for a small but feisty hunting dog that was small enough to pursue foxes in the ground. They are popular family dogs loved for their spunky and intelligent personalities and playful disposition. Be aware that they can be rather noisy. They also have a high prey drive and may not be a good match for homes with small furries.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat that can be smooth or rough; white with black, tan, or brown markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 18 years</p><h2>French Bulldog</h2><p>The popularity of the French bulldog has exploded in recent years mainly because of their goofy, fun-loving personalities; they're also intensely loyal. They are in the top five most popular dogs in the U.S. Their unique look with erect ears and wrinkly face has captured the hearts of millions. Their flat faces (boxers, too) can make them prone to respiratory issues and easy overheating. Be particularly careful if you are playing with a brachycephalic dog in the yard during the summer.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 19 to 28 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat in brindle, fawn, white, or combination of brindle and white or fawn and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Portuguese Water Dog</h2><p>If you suffer from allergies but can't resist owning a dog, you may find a furry BFF in the Portuguese water dog. While no dog is truly hypoallergenic, this medium-sized breed with a fluffy coat does not shed significantly, although regular grooming is recommended to prevent mats.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Weight: 35 to 60 pounds</p><p>Height:: 17 to 23 inches</p><p>Coat and Color: Wavy or tightly curled; black, black and white, and brown, though coat color may also be white or silver-tipped</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 13 years</p>",1262
34,https://www.thesprucepets.com/worst-dog-breeds-for-allergies-4845885,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>10 Worst Dog Breeds for People With Allergies</h1>,"<h1>10 Worst Dog Breeds for People With Allergies</h1><h2>Canines that are most likely to trigger a sneezing fit</h2><p>Some dog breeds are more likely than others to cause reactions in people with allergies. Meanwhile, other breeds are considered hypoallergenic and might be a better bet if you or a member of your household suffers from allergies. Take a closer look at why people with allergies should steer clear of certain dogs.</p><p>Most people assume that the less hairy a dog is, the less likely they are to set off allergies. It's not true. The hair isn't the problem as much as it is their dander and saliva. All canines produce dander-the dead skin that flakes from the body. Dander clings to dog hairs, so pooches that naturally shed a lot leave more dander around the house. Breeds prone to drooling tend to be problematic, too, since they will spread more saliva around the home.</p><h2>Basset Hound</h2><p>Basset hounds are generally sweet, lovable, and mild-mannered, with a characterful stubborn streak. They are one of the most favored hounds, but not necessarily the right choice for people with allergies. They have generous jowls and skin folds and are champion droolers. Their saliva is more likely to find its way onto your skin, soft furnishings, and other items in the home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: Less than 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat; coat color includes combinations of black, white, brown, tan, lemon, mahogany, and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Doberman Pinscher</h2><p>If you are a big dog lover looking for a smart and trainable protector, a Doberman would be a perfect choice-as long as you don't have allergies. This breed frequently triggers flare-ups. These dogs have a thin, single coat, and their shedding is moderate rather than excessive, but they're big dogs with more hair and dander. Dobies are also prone to allergies and skin sensitivities, more than your average breed. Dog skin allergies mean dry and flaky skin and larger amounts of dander deposits around the house.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat in black, red, blue, or fawn with rust markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>German Shepherd</h2><p>German shepherds are one of the most enduringly popular breeds. They're smart, eager to please, devoted, and brave. Unfortunately, this dog has been known to trigger bad allergic reactions. They're one of the most excessive shedders, regardless of whether you get a long- or a short-haired one. Their hairs get everywhere, especially when they drop their coat twice a year. This big dog sheds masses of hair, which inevitably results in a lot of dander in the environment.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick undercoat and a dense, slightly wavy or straight outer coat with tan and black or red and black coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 13 years</p><h2>Siberian Husky</h2><p>Huskies are another prevalent breed. Strikingly beautiful, athletic, and friendly, they are well-suited to very active households but can be problematic if there is a person with allergies in the home. Huskies and other double-coated breeds are known for depositing masses of hair around the home. Their thick layers of fur keep them warm in their native Arctic homelands. These dogs often top the list of excessive shedders.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 20 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 60 pounds for males; 35 to 50 pounds for females</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat that comes in a variety of colors, including combinations of black, gray, white, and tan</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><p>The Labrador Retriever tops the American Kennel Club's list of most popular breeds every year. These dogs are smart, loyal, wonderful family pets. Sadly, however, they are known for frequently triggering human allergies. Their double coat may be relatively short, but it's dense and sheds profusely. They're also known for often suffering from dry, flaky skin. The silver lining is that if you let your water-loving Lab swim frequently, it may reduce the dander concentration level in the home's air, potentially decreasing the frequency of allergy flare-ups.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, water-resistant coats; black, chocolate, or yellow</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Pekingese</h2><p>Pekingese fans love this breed for their affectionate, loyal, and spirited personalities. Their long shedding coat presents a problem for people with allergies, though, and the breed is known for being rather stubborn when it comes to house training. Dander and saliva aren't the only allergy triggers; dog urine is, too. If your Peke is marking around the house, this behavior increases the chances of allergy flare-ups. A good enzymatic stain and odor remover will be necessary for your cleaning arsenal to neutralize traces of urine.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: Up to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, thick double coat that is gold, sable, red, gray, black, tan, or cream</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Pug</h2><p>Pug are small, short-coated dogs that shed year-round. Their wrinkled, flat snout is prone to gathering a lot of slobber around their jowls. Pugs are also prone to having sensitive skin and are susceptible to allergies, resulting in dry skin and more dander. Their skin folds can contribute to the development of bacterial infections, too. If your pug is itchy and uncomfortable, they are more likely to rub up against soft furnishings and carpets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 18 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat that typically comes in fawn or black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Saint Bernard</h2><p>Saint Bernards are sometimes called the nanny dog because of their gentle and loyal temperament, especially with families. Still, they are the triple whammy when it comes to potentially triggering allergies. They're a giant breed. The bigger the dog, the more dander produced. This breed sheds a lot, circulating dander all over the home. And, when it comes to dog drool, few dogs will beat Saint Bernards in this department. Saliva gets everywhere with this breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 26 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 120 to 180 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and smooth or long and silky coat white with red, brown or brindle markings; a black ""mask"" is typically seen</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>Cocker spaniels (and other spaniel breeds) were bred as bird hunting dogs. Over time, they evolved into the perfect mid-sized family dog, except if you have allergies. These dogs have stunning, long-haired coats that shed dander from their fur, and they tend to drool, too. This breed is also prone to skin allergies, which can ultimately lead to even more dander getting spread into the air.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 20 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Silky and flat or slightly wavy; short and fine on the head, medium length on the body, and well-feathered on the ears, chest, belly, and legs; black, ASCOB (any solid color other than black), or parti-color (black and white, brown and white, red and white, and tri-color)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Boxer</h2><p>Boxers are energetic and well-matched for families with playful, young children. They drool a lot and lick their fur and skin often, leaving dried-on saliva on their coat. Boxers shed their dander-laden, short-haired hair year-round. These are all red flags for allergy sufferers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 1 foot, 9 inches to 2 feet, 1 inch at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat; fawn and brindle are the standard colors; standard markings include a black mask, a black mask with white markings, and white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p>",1264
35,https://www.thesprucepets.com/most-popular-dog-breeds-4160621,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>Most Popular Dog Breeds of 2022</h1>,"<h1>Most Popular Dog Breeds of 2022</h1><p>There are hundreds of dog breeds in the world and while certain breeds are classics that will always be popular, others rise and fall in popularity based on trends and pop culture. A number of factors-like maintenance needs and trainability-usually play a part in a dog's popularity, too.</p><h2>Boxer</h2><p>The beautiful boxer is an affectionate, loyal family dog that has been popular for many years. Despite its history as a fighting dog, the breed has developed into a gentle, playful companion with no trace of aggression. This dog breed typically gets along very well with kids when properly trained. However, boxers like to jump up and can forget their size from time to time, so training is a must. Though the boxer can be a goofy clown, it has a serious side when it comes to protecting loved ones.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 20 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Stocky, muscular, powerful body; square, blocky head with undershot jaw and short muzzle; short coat with fawn and brindle as standard colors, standard markings include a black mask, black mask with white markings, and white markings</p><h2>Yorkshire Terrier</h2><p>The Yorkshire terrier is a favorite among fans of small dog breeds. Nicknamed the Yorkie, this is the quintessential ""purse dog,"" rarely touching the ground and often seen with a bow in its hair. However, make no mistake: This is not a wimpy dog. The Yorkie makes up for its small stature with a huge personality. Believe it or not, this breed can be quite the watchdog, vocally alerting you to the goings-on around the house. At the end of the day, the Yorkie is not a working dog but more of an affectionate companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 7 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Petite stature; standard color combinations are black and gold, black and tan, blue and gold, and blue and tan; long, straight, and silky coat</p><h2>Rottweiler</h2><p>The Rottweiler is a loyal and protective companion that sometimes gets a bad rap. This large dog may seem intimidating to some, but most Rottweilers are loving and gentle towards their loved ones. Training and socialization are the keys to a well-behaved and happy Rottweiler. These powerful dogs can be difficult to manage without structure. Despite sometimes being called a ""dangerous breed,"" this is an unfair label; this dog is a loving and loyal canine which may be why the Rottweiler has become more popular.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 80 to 130 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large, muscular body with a rugged short, somewhat coarse but shiny black coat with clearly defined rich tan facial markings</p><h2>Poodle</h2><p>The poodle is another memorable dog breed with a rich history as a favorite of the aristocracy. Poodles have also been known as entertaining performers. Possibly due to its fancy haircut and ""frou-frou"" appearance, many people don't realize that this is a highly intelligent dog breed. Perhaps one reason the poodle is so popular is that it comes in three sizes: toy, miniature, and standard. Much to the delight of their enthusiasts, the smaller varieties are known for their longevity.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Standard: 15 inches; miniature: 10 to 15 inches; toy: 10 inches and under</p><p>Weight: Standard: 45 to 70 pounds; miniature: 15 to 18 pounds; toy: 5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Curly, dense single-layer coats that may be one of many solid colors, including white, black, grey, brown, and apricot</p><h2>French Bulldog</h2><p>The popularity of the French bulldog has soared in recent years. It is not surprising once you get a look at the breed. These are adorable, playful, affectionate dogs that, as adults, continue to look like puppies. Their extra-large ears and cute wrinkles make them irresistible to many people. Their compact size and sturdiness are great features for those who love small dogs that are not too delicate.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 19 to 28 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, compact dog breed with a large head, short snout, and bat-like ears</p><h2>Beagle</h2><p>The lovable beagle is an energetic hound that has an affinity for children and family life. Vocal to an almost comical point, the beagle can carry on quite the canine conversation, especially with its signature bay. The breed is small to medium in size but is sturdy, robust, and able to keep up with the rest. The beagle also has a nose for mischief but in the most endearing way. Plus, that amazing nose can be put to work sniffing out other kinds of trouble, specifically bombs and drugs at airports and similar checkpoints.</p><h2>Bulldog</h2><p>The increasingly popular bulldog shares ancestry with the boxer. Yet, also like the boxer, time has turned this former fighting dog into a gentle canine companion. The bulldog is known for its stocky frame, extremely sturdy build and overall ""tough guy"" appearance. This is probably why the breed is commonly used as the mascot of sports teams. When you get to know a bulldog, you'll discover that the breed is quite affectionate.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 50 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-size dog that has a thick-set body with straight, short, fine-textured, smooth coat colored red, white, fawn, or fallow (pale brown); short-muzzled head is massive and square; broad shoulders and chest with thick, sturdy limbs</p><h2>Golden Retriever</h2><p>The golden retriever is a loyal and affectionate family dog with a big heart. With an eager-to-please attitude, this breed is often found working as a service or assistance dog. The golden is also a wonderful therapy dog with its eternally happy disposition. Plus, this breed seems to have written the book when it comes to befriending children, making the breed a perfect match for family life. Goldens have been very popular dogs for decades.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 21 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, muscular, medium-sized dog with a lustrous gold coat with a broad head, friendly and intelligent eyes, and short ears</p><h2>German Shepherd</h2><p>The German shepherd has always been an extremely popular dog breed. This hard-working, loyal dog is probably best known for its skills as a protection animal, police dog, and search-and-rescue hero. However, this serious and diligent dog breed has a softer, goofier side. Perhaps that is why the breed is still quite favored as a companion animal. One thing is for certain: It will watch over and defend your home and family. Don't let its tough exterior fool you, though. This breed is affectionate and playful with its loved ones.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 100 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large, athletic build with a double coat, comprised of a thick undercoat and a dense, slightly wavy or straight outer coat with tan and black or red and black coloring</p><h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><p>It should come as no surprise that the Labrador retriever has been the most popular dog in the United States for decades and for good reason. This energetic, fun-loving retriever has ""family dog"" written all over it. Loyal and affectionate, the Lab wins over the hearts of just about everyone it meets. For over 200 years, the Lab has been treasured for its loyalty, intelligence, and athleticism. The breed is often seen working as a service animal or gun dog but remains a favorite among those looking for an all-around canine companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 21 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium to large-sized sturdy, athletic build; smooth, water-resistant coats; otter-like tail; a clean-cut head with a broad skull, powerful jaws, and friendly eyes.</p>",1219

Some of these non-shedding breeds are also hypoallergenic, which will avoid triggering any allergy you may have to pet hair.</p><p>If you're interested in a breed that doesn't shed because you are allergic to dogs, it's important to understand the difference between non-shedding and hypoallergenic (and also what the term hypoallergenic&rdquo; really means). Just because a breed is non-shedding or hypoallergenic does not mean it is guaranteed not to trigger an allergic reaction, but a hypoallergenic dog breed is likely to cause a reaction in an allergic person.</p><h2>Airedale Terrier</h2><p>The Airedale Terrier is known as the King of Terriers&rdquo; because it is the largest of all the terrier breeds. The Airedale was developed in England in the Aire Valley, where it was valued as a duck hunter and rat killer. The short, wiry coat may be straight, crinkled, or slightly waved. The coat does not shed, but it must be professionally clipped or hand-stripped three or four times a year.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 23 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Strong and well balanced. The hard, wiry, dense, straight, short coat is a mix of tan and black or dark grizzle, with tan head and ears.</p><h2>Afghan Hound</h2><p>The Afghan Hound is a very ancient breed that originated thousands of years ago in the mountain region of what is currently Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. Here, the swift dogs were used for hunting and prized as loyal companions by royalty and nobility. The long, thick, silky flowing coat does not shed, but it needs a lot of maintenance, including frequent bathing (using both shampoo and conditioner), as well as lots of brushing (up to several hours every week).</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 50 to 60 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Tall, lean and powerful, with very pronounced hipbones. The coat can be any color or combination of colors, including brindle and domino.</p><h2>Briard</h2><p>The Briard hails from France, where it has long been used to herd sheep and guard flocks from predators and thieves. The long, coarse, slightly wavy coat is dirt and water-resistant, and sheds very little as long as it is maintained correctly with plenty of brushing and combing (you might need to devote a few hours a week to this task). Bathe the Briard once a month, and have its hair trimmed by a professional groomer every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 22 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 55 to 100 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Powerful, strong and agile, with a coarse, long coat in black, gray, or tawny.</p><h2>Giant Schnauzer</h2><p>The Giant Schnauzer is the largest of three related Schnauzer breeds. It was bred up from the Standard Schnauzer, which was the original Schnauzer (the Miniature Schnauzer was bred down from the Standard). In Germany, the Giant Schnauzer drove cattle to the market, and worked as an all-around farm dog and guard dog. The Giant Schnauzer's dense, wiry coat sheds very little. It needs regular professional grooming, but in between appointments can be easily maintained with weekly brushing.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 23.5 to 27.5 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: About 55 to 85 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Robust, strongly built, and nearly square. The hard, wiry, dense coat forms a beard and eyebrows, and may be solid black or pepper and salt (gray).</p><h2>Irish Water Spaniel</h2><p>The Irish Water Spaniel hails from Ireland, where it has long been used as a versatile hunting dog, able to point, flush, and retrieve downed birds, including ducks, geese, pheasant, and quail. The Irish Water Spaniel is covered in covered with dense, tight, crisp curls, but the long tail is completely smooth tail, earning the breed the nickname of Rat Tail Spaniel&rdquo;.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 21 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 45 to 68 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Strongly built and well-boned. The dense, crisp, and tightly curled coat comes in solid liver (brown).</p><h2>Komondor</h2><p>The Komondor comes from Hungary, where it has been used for centuries as livestock guardian, protecting sheep from wolves and other predators, as well as guarding the farm and family. The coat is traditionally corded, which means the hair is encouraged to grow into long white dreadlocks, which allow the dog to blend in with his flock. The cords of hair are so thick they can serve as armor against attacking wolves and keep the dog warm in harsh weather.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: At least 25.5 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 80 to 100 pounds or more</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large and muscular with plenty of bone and substance; covered with a heavy coat of white cords.</p><h2>Peruvian Inca Orchid (Large)</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 19.75 to 25.75 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 26.5 to 55 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Elegant and slim; hairless with smooth and elastic skin.</p><h2>Poodle (Standard)</h2><p>The Poodle comes in three size varieties. The largest is the Standard Poodle, followed by the Miniature and Toy Poodles. The Standard was the original Poodle, developed in Germany as a water retriever. The naturally harsh, dense curly coat is hypoallergenic and does not shed, but it is high maintenance. The Standard poodle must be professionally groomed every one to two months and brushed every other day (daily for longer coats) to prevent mats.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: Standard: More than 15 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: Standard: About 40 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Squarely built, well-proportioned and smoothly muscled. The harsh, dense, curly coat comes in many solid colors, including but not limited to white, black, silver, brown, and apricot.</p><h2>Portuguese Water Dog</h2><p>The sporty-looking Portuguese Water Dog has been known in Portugal for hundreds of years, where it helped fishermen, swimming from boat to boat or boat to shore, to deliver messages, retrieve broken nets, and even herd fish into nets. The waterproof coat does not shed and is considered hypoallergenic. The PWD requires weekly brushing and combing, and professional grooming every month or two.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 35 to 60 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: A robust dog of medium build. The profuse coat may be curly or wavy, and comes in black, white and brown, with or without white markings.</p><h2>Wirehaired Pointing Griffon</h2><p>The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was developed in the Netherlands in the late 1800s to be a versatile hunting breed. Today, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon remains an excellent pointing and retrieving dog used to hunt upland birds. The straight, wiry, harsh, water-resistant double coat does not shed, but it must be brushed out thoroughly at least once a week.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 20 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 35 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-sized and strong of limb. The harsh, wiry, straight coat may be steel gray with brown markings, mchestnut brown, roan, white and brown, or white and orange.</p><h2>Xoloitzcuintli (Standard)</h2><p>The Xoloitzcuintli (pronounced show-low-eats-QUEENT-lee&rdquo; or show-low&rdquo; for short), also known as the Mexican Hairless Dog, evolved naturally in Mexico at least 3,000 years ago. The Xolo comes in three sizes: standard is the largest, followed by miniature and toy. The breed is hairless with tough, smooth skin, though some dogs have a small amount of short, coarse hair on top of the head, on the feet, and on the last third of the tail.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Standard: 18 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: Standard: 30 to 55 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Lean, sturdy and muscular. The skin is tough, protective, smooth and close fitting and comes in a range of dark, uniform colors including black, gray black, slate, red, liver, and bronze.</p>",1255

The United States in particular has given the dog world some incredible breeds. From California to Massachusetts, these all-American dog breeds are as unique and varied as the 50 states. They range in appearance, temperament, and purpose. Some were bred to work while others were developed more as lovable companions.</p><p>Here are 10 dog breeds that were born and bred in the United States.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Some American dog breeds can be found quite easily at animal shelters and reputable breeders throughout the country, but others aren't as common. Try a breed-specific rescue if you have your heart set on a particular breed.</p><h2>American Bulldog</h2><p>The bulldog originated in England centuries ago where it was used to guard property, to drive cattle, and in barbaric blood sports. Bulldogs came to the United States in the 1700s where they also were used on farms and ranches for livestock work and as guardians. Around the time of World War II the breed was almost extinct, but breeders revitalized it and created a standard for the American version. These dogs are athletic, stocky, and muscular, yet they also can be quite friendly and clownish.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Service Stock</p><p>Height: 22 to 25 inches (male); 20 to 23 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 75 to 100 pounds (male); 60 to 80 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat; comes in any color, color pattern, or combination of colors other than solid black, solid blue, merle, and tricolor</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>American Hairless Terrier</h2><p>The American hairless terrier came into existence when a hairless female puppy named Josephine was born in a litter of purebred rat terriers. Josephine's owners, Edwin and Willie Scott of Louisiana, made it their mission to see whether they could produce more hairless puppies by breeding Josephine to other rat terriers. The American hairless terrier was fully recognized by the American Kennel Club in 2016 as part of the Terrier Group. It is the first hairless breed to be developed in the United States.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 12 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 12 to 16 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Soft and smooth hairless body; sometimes covered in a fine layer of almost invisible hair.</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 16 years</p><h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2><p>The Alaskan malamute is a sled dog breed that's believed to have descended from wolf-dogs of thousands of years ago. Its name comes from the Mahlemiut, Inuit people of Alaska who developed a dog that could haul heavy loads over long distances and in harsh conditions. The Alaskan malamute has a thick double coat and a long tail that curves over its back to keep it warm. It's been recognized by the American Kennel Club since 1935.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 inches (male); 23 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 85 pounds (male); 75 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, dense, fluffy double coat; comes in a variety of colors, including gray, black, sable, and white; eyes must always be brown, never blue</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>American Eskimo Dog</h2><p>Despite its name, the American Eskimo dog was created not by indigenous people but by German immigrants to the U.S. who brought their German spitz dogs with them in the early 1800s. The highly trainable, striking white dogs proved extremely popular, and many even performed in circuses and other traveling shows. During World War I when there was a prejudice against Germany, the Germany spitz name was changed to American Eskimo dog. Today's Eskies are still charming and clever companions that love to have fun.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 12 inches (toy); 12 to 15 inches (miniature); 15 to 19 inches (standard)</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds (toy); 10 to 20 pounds (miniature); 25 to 35 pounds (standard)</p><p>Coat and Color: Straight, dense double coat; white or white and biscuit in color</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Australian Shepherd</h2><p>The Australian shepherd's name is a complete misnomer; the breed was developed in the United States, not Australia. The Australian shepherd got its name because its predecessors passed through Australia. People from a region near the Pyrenees Mountains brought their shepherd dogs to Australia when they immigrated there. Then, some California ranchers got their hands on some of these herders and developed the Australian shepherd we know and love today. The Aussie is extremely smart, athletic, energetic, and personable.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 20 to 23 inches (male); 18 to 21 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 65 pounds (male); 40 to 55 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length straight to wavy coat; comes in blue merle, black, red merle, and red with or without white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Boston Terrier</h2><p>The Boston terrier was created in-you guessed it-Boston, Massachusetts. A dog named Judge, who was a cross between a bulldog and the extinct white English terrier, was sold to a Boston man. Judge was fairly small at around 30 pounds, but he was quite muscular. He formed the foundation of the Boston terrier breed. Through selective breeding, dogs that were even smaller and with a sweeter face arose to give us the breed we have today.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 12 to 25 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth coat; brindle, seal, or black with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2>Boykin Spaniel</h2><p>The Boykin spaniel was developed in South Carolina around the turn of the 20th century by breeders who desired a fairly small dog with which to hunt turkeys from boats. According to legend, all Boykins are descended from a small mixed-breed stray that was trained by Whitaker Whit&rdquo; Boykin. These cheerful, outgoing dogs get along well with other dogs and possibly the family cat if taught to respect it, but pet birds cannot be considered safe around a Boykin. Boykins love people, including well-mannered children.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15.5 to 18 inches (male); 14 to 16.5 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 30 to 40 pounds (male); 25 to 35 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length distinctive rich liver, brown, or dark chocolate coat that ranges from straight to slightly wavy</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Chesapeake Bay Retriever</h2><p>The Chesapeake Bay retriever was created in the region around the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary that reaches through Maryland and Virginia. The Chessie, as it is often called, was developed by duck hunters to be an excellent hunter and swimmer-and a tireless retriever of ducks. Newfoundlands, Irish water spaniels, and hounds are likely in its genetic mix. The dog has webbed feet to help it swim, along with a coat that repels water and keeps it warm.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 26 inches (male); 21 to 24 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 65 to 80 pounds (male); 55 to 70 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, thick, waterproof coat; comes in various colors of brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 13 years</p><h2>Catahoula Leopard Dog</h2><p>A hardy dog breed developed in the South as an all-purpose farm and hunting dog, the Catahoula leopard dog is named for its place of origin: Catahoula Parish, Louisiana. Today, the Catahoula is the official state dog of Louisiana. Although Catahoula leopard dogs are working dogs, they are also devoted family companions. Most get along well with respectful children when raised with them. But due to their hunting instincts, they might not get along well with other pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Stock Service</p><p>Height: 22 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 95 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat; comes in many different patterns and colors from brindle to patched to solid (any color other than solid white); many have blue eyes and a leopard-patterned coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>Toy Fox Terrier</h2><p>The toy fox terrier was developed in the United States in the 1930s by combining smooth fox terriers with toy breeds, including miniature pinschers and Italian greyhounds. It is a sweet, fun, and friendly dog. However, toy fox terriers also are small and fragile, so they are not recommended for families with rowdy children. These dogs are energetic and playful, but thanks to their size they can live in a small home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 8.5 and 11.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 3.5 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth, satiny coat; comes in white, chocolate and tan, white and tan, white and black, or tricolor</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p>",1354
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-breeds-with-blue-eyes-5089039,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>10 Dog Breeds With Blue Eyes</h1>,"<h1>10 Dog Breeds With Blue Eyes</h1><p>Some dogs sport icy-colored irises as a breed trademark, while others may get blue eyes as a recessive trait. Other dogs with a particular coat color, specifically merle (mottled patches) or piebald (a white coat with spots), tend to get blue eyes passed on to them.</p><p>If your dog has the merle or piebald gene, it cannot consistently create pigment, which would explain the light eyes. Similarly, albino dogs lack melanin pigmentation and tend to be blue-eyed. Some dogs, like huskies, have a higher likelihood of heterochromia-two different colored eyes. Blues are beautiful, but if you notice your dog's eyes are suddenly turning blue or cloudy, have your dog checked for cataracts or glaucoma.</p><p>When two merle or piebald carriers breed, their litter is at much greater risk of health issues, such as being born deaf, blind, or both. This breeding is considered inhumane. However, a dog with the merle or piebald gene bred with a non-carrier dog is safe.</p><h2>Siberian Husky</h2><p>One of the first dog breeds to come to mind when you think of blue eyes may be the Siberian husky. These stunning dogs commonly have iconic, icy-blue eyes that mirror the tundra of their native land. They can also have brown eyes or a heterochromatic combination of both. Wolf-looking Siberian huskies were bred for companionship and pulling loads by dogsled, making them perfect dogs for families who like to stay active.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 20 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Double-layered coat in black, gray, red, brown, tan, or white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Australian Shepherd</h2><p>Australian shepherds that have merle coloring have a higher likelihood of getting impressive light blue eyes. These dogs tend to have a higher chance of getting a mix of both blue and brown eyes. The herding Aussie is brilliant and full of energy and excels in agility competitions. They are best suited for an active home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 18 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick coat can be found in a variety of colors and patterns, including spots, splotches, or merle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Weimaraner</h2><p>The Weimaraner is known for its sleek, silver-gray coat and loving, active personality. Their kind eyes can be amber or blue, a perfect complement to the breed's iconic silver-gray coat. These happy, high-energy pooches were bred in the 1800s in Germany for hunting and grew in popularity as companion dogs. They are great with children.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 90 pounds (males); 55 to 75 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, silver-gray coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2>Border Collie</h2><p>These dogs are considered one of the most intelligent breeds with a thoughtful, intense gaze. The border collie's eyes can be varying shades of brown, gold, or blue. Blue eyes are more common in merle-coated border collies. With endless energy and high intelligence, these dogs thrive with mental and physical challenges, including agility competitions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long coat that can be smooth or rough in white, black, gray, blue, chocolate, and red; most are either two-toned or merle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Dachshund</h2><p>Blue eyes may not be desirable in show dachshunds, but they are still a beautiful trait. Doxies with a merle coat will most often have blue-eye variations, including full blue, one blue and one brown, or even both colors in one eye. Bred for hunting badgers and rabbits, these dogs are brave and boisterous and make wonderful watchdogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: Standard: 8 to 9 inches for standard; miniature: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: Standard: 16 to 32 pounds; miniature: up to 11 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, long, or wirehaired; colors include red, blue, black, chocolate, and cream</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h2><p>These small yet strong dogs are known for their unique features, such as short legs, long bodies, and large, upright ears. To add to their unique looks, the Cardigan Welsh corgi can also have striking blue eyes. Like the dachshund, a Cardigan may have two blue eyes, one blue and one brown, or even both colors in one eye. These unique eye colors are most common in corgis with merle coats.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 38 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Dense double coat in black, white, red, cream, merle, sable, and brindle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Great Dane</h2><p>These gentle giants turn heads with their size alone, but a Great Dane with beautiful blue eyes is an eye-catcher. Most Great Dane puppies are born with blue eyes that change to brown as they mature. Dapple-coated harlequin and merle Great Danes keep their baby blues their whole life. These large dogs make loving, protective watchdogs and are surprisingly adaptable to homes of all sizes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 28 to 32 inches</p><p>Weight: 140 to 175 pounds (males); 110 to 140 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat in black, brindle, fawn, blue, merle, or harlequin</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 8 years</p><h2>Catahoula Leopard Dog</h2><p>These dogs are known as leopard dogs for their spotted coats, which can come in a wide array of colors, including blue, red, gray, black, cream, or chocolate. Their eyes can also come in blue, amber, green, brown, or a combination. Most Catahoulas have merle patterns or leopard-like spots of multiple colorings. An American-bred working dog from Louisiana, it hunted and herded and needs a lot of room to run and expend its energy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 95 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat can be a wide variety of colors but is most notable for its leopard-like spots or merle markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>Alaskan Klee Kai</h2><p>The Alaskan klee kai looks a lot like a miniature husky, although, unlike its larger relative, it was bred for companionship and not work. The klee kai can have icy blue, brown, hazel, or green eyes. These smaller-sized canines make great small companions and excellent watchdogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Northern Breed (UKC); not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 13 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick coat, typically darker on the back (black, red, or gray), the top of the head, and around the eyes with white legs, belly, and lower half of the face and muzzle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Pit Bull</h2><p>The pit bull is another dog often born with blue eyes that change color as they mature. However, blue-eyed mature pit bulls do exist, often accompanying blue-, gray-, or brindle-coated pits. The name ""pit bull"" is a general term for breeds that include the American Staffordshire terrier and the American pit bull terrier. These bully breeds&rdquo; can make a very loving addition to an active family.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (UKC); not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 17 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat in black, white, blue, gray, brindle, fawn, red, or brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 15 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>If you have a desire for a dog with baby blues, then you'd likely want to steer clear of the majority of breeds. Brown is the most common eye color in dogs. Purebreds that are least likely to have light-colored eyes include golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers, German shepherds, beagles, dobermans, poodles, and many more. Those puppies have a greater chance of having blue eyes if any of these breeds mix with dogs prone to light eyes. Although extremely rare, albinism can occur in any breed, causing blue eyes.</p>",1237

You'll find long, short, curly, fluffy, straight, and wiry fur and everything in between. Some dogs have what is called a single coat, or one layer of fur. And other dogs have a double coat with a short undercoat hidden beneath a longer outer coat. These two layers help to insulate the dog against cold weather, and they even cool the dog in hot weather by trapping cool air close to the skin. The double coat also has a waterproofing effect. In fact, many double-coated dog breeds were developed to work in cold conditions and in water.</p><p>Here are 11 double-coated dog breeds that can withstand harsh conditions.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Most double-coated dog breeds are heavy shedders and often will go through periods of excessive shedding as the seasons change. Brushing a few times a week, or even daily, will be necessary to remove loose fur and prevent mats from forming. Be sure to use a brush with bristles that are long enough to reach through the outer coat to get to the undercoat. Some very fluffy dogs with thick undercoats might benefit from being groomed with a wide-toothed comb or grooming rake.</p><h2>Akita</h2><p>The Akita's double coat consists of a thick, soft, dense undercoat and a straight, harsh, short outer coat. These dogs actually don't regularly shed much and are known to be clean with little odor. But they still need brushing a couple times a week. Roughly twice a year they will ""blow"" their undercoat, shedding excessively. Daily brushing during that time will help to contain the loose fur.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 26 to 28 inches (male); 24 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 100 to 130 pounds (male); 70 to 100 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, thick double coat that may be any color, including white, brindle (brown with tiger stripes), or pinto (white background with large colored patches)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 13 years</p><h2>Australian Shepherd</h2><p>The attractive double coat of the Australian shepherd consists of a medium-length, straight to wavy, weather-resistant outer coat and a shorter undercoat. These herding dogs generally need a weekly brushing to prevent mats and remove loose fur. They also go through profuse shedding periods. During that time, using a grooming rake every couple of days will help to get rid of loose undercoat fur.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 20 to 23 inches (male); 18 to 21 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 65 pounds (male); 40 to 55 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length straight to wavy double coat that comes in blue merle, black, red merle, or red, all with or without white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Bernese Mountain Dog</h2><p>The Bernese mountain dog's double coat consists of a thick, moderately long, and slightly wavy or straight outer coat and a shorter, wooly undercoat. These dogs shed quite a bit on a regular basis and even more when they blow their coats a couple times a year. Brush them at least weekly and up to daily during their major sheds. Use a slicker brush or metal comb to remove any tangles in the coat. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 25 to 27.5 inches (male); 23 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 80 to 115 pounds (male); 70 to 95 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Tricolor, thick double coat (black base color with white and tan markings)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 10 years</p><h2>Chow Chow</h2><p>The chow chow's double coat may be long (called rough) or short (called smooth). The rough coat consists of a dense, straight outer coat paired with a soft, thick, wooly undercoat. The smooth coat has a slightly harsher texture than the rough coat, and it doesn't have an obvious ruff (thicker hair around the head) or feathering (longer hair along the ears, legs, abdomen, or tail) like the rough coat chow does. Both smooth- and rough-coated chows need brushing at least twice a week.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Rough or smooth double coat that comes in black, blue, cinnamon, cream, or red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 12 years</p><h2>Keeshond</h2><p>The Keeshond's thick double coat is naturally clean and typically has very little odor. The outer coat is long and straight, and the undercoat is thick and downy. These dogs need brushing at least weekly and are only moderate shedders. They also might need a bit of trimming on their longer fur, especially around their feet, to keep it tidy. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 18 inches (male); 17 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 35 to 45 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Very thick double coat in cream, black, and gray color variations</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><p>The Labrador retriever's double coat is made up of a short, thick outer coat paired with a soft, weather-resistant undercoat. This dense coat helps to protect the Lab from cold weather, water, and dense underbrush. These dogs are fairly high shedders and should be brushed at least weekly to contain loose fur. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 22.5 to 24.5 inches (male); 21.5 to 23.5 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 65 to 80 pounds (male); 55 to 70 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense double coat that comes in black, chocolate, or yellow</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Leonberger</h2><p>The Leonberger's double coat consists of a thick, straight, and water-resistant outer coat and a soft, dense undercoat. The fur ranges from medium to long. In male dogs, the hair around the neck forms a luxurious, lion-like mane. These dogs are high shedders and prone to matting, so they should be brushed daily. Pay special attention to the long hair behind their ears and on their legs. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 to 31.5 inches (male); 25.5 to 29.5 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 110 to 170 pounds (male); 90 to 140 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Double coat in gold, red, reddish-brown, sand, or yellow-brown; black face mask</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 years</p><h2>Newfoundland</h2><p>The Newfoundland's flat, thick, water-resistant double coat consists of a coarse, moderately long, straight or wavy outer coat and a soft, dense undercoat. These dogs are moderate shedders and typically require brushing a couple times a week. But they do blow their coats twice a year and will need daily brushing then.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 inches (male); 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 130 to 150 pounds (male); 100 to 120 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Commonly black double coat, can also come in brown, gray, or black and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 10 years</p><h2>Pekingese</h2><p>The Pekingese's long, thick, double coat is profuse, consisting of a coarse, straight outer coat and a thick, soft undercoat. The coat forms a ruff around the neck like a lion's mane. Grooming is pretty involved for these little dogs, though they are only moderate shedders. Brush them a few times a week to remove tangles and loose fur. A metal comb might be necessary in addition to a brush to work out tangles. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: Up to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coat commonly seen in variations of gold, red, or sable but may also be black and tan, white, cream, or gray</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Pomeranian</h2><p>The Pomeranian's fluffy double coat is made up of a long, thick outer coat and a short, dense undercoat. It forms a profuse ruff around the neck that extends over the shoulders and chest. These dogs are moderate shedders but still need brushing a few times a week to prevent mats. Be sure to use a brush that reaches all the way through the coat to groom the undercoat. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long double coat that most commonly comes in red, orange, cream, brown, or black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 16 years</p><h2>Saint Bernard</h2><p>The Saint Bernard's double coat may be short or long. In the shorthaired Saint Bernard, the dense, tough outer coat lies smooth. And in the longhaired Saint Bernard, the outer coat is medium length and straight to slightly wavy. Both have a thick undercoat. They need at least weekly brushing and go through more profuse shedding periods twice a year.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p><br/></p><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 to 30 inches (male); 26 to 28 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 140 to 180 pounds (male); 120 to 140 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick coat that comes in white with red, brown, or brindle markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p>",1313
44,https://www.thesprucepets.com/norwegian-dog-breeds-4796920,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>6 Top Dog Breeds From Norway</h1>,"<h1>6 Top Dog Breeds From Norway</h1><h2>Some of these Norwegian breeds are hard to find</h2><p>Half of the Norwegian breeds are spitz-type breeds. These are dogs that have been developed to live and work in harsh, cold weather conditions common in the Arctic Circle. They commonly have thick, weather-proof coats. The other half of the dogs from Norway are hare hunting scenthounds. Apart from the elkhound and the buhund, it would be unusual to find these breeds anywhere other than their native country. And, even in Norway, they are hard to find.</p><p>When considering a dog that's right for you, think about whether a specific breed is suited to your home climate. Heavy-coated dogs can acclimate to life in the tropics but require air conditioning breaks, ample water, and shade. You can expect heavy shedding, too. Likewise, a thin-coated, small dog can live in cold climates, but you will need to make allowances for cold-weather gear and shorter outdoor walks.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Spitzes are dogs acclimated to the cooler temps of the Arctic region. They have double-coated fur and pointed ears and muzzles. They are said to look wolf or fox-like. Their tail often curls or droops. They usually shed twice per year, often in clumps. Scent hounds are hunting dogs that follow a scent rather than hunting by sight. These breeds are generally regarded as having some of the most sensitive noses among dogs. Most have pendulous ears, which are said to droop low to the ground to sweep scents to the nose.</p><p>Here are the top dogs from the Scandinavian country of Norway.</p><h2>Norwegian Lundehund</h2><p>You will rarely find a Norwegian lundehund outside of its native country or the dog show circuit. Even in Norway, a lundehund is hard to come by. This unique, little spitz-type dog hunted puffins (""lunde"" in Norwegian) and their eggs on the remote Islands off Norway's coast. They are high-energy, prolific diggers with a keen hunting sense and prey drive.</p><p>The lunde has two fewer teeth than your average dog, meaning it likely has an ancient heritage. It is similar to the 5,000-year-old fossil of the primitive Russian Varanger dog found with the same dental structure. The breed is incredibly flexible; its neck can tip back to touch its back, helping it squeeze into small spaces to find puffins and their nests on rugged cliffs. Lundes can also manipulate their shoulder joints to a ninety-degree angle. This flexibility helps them get traction on slippery and steep surfaces.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 12 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Harsh, short topcoat and a dense, soft undercoat; colors range from fallow, tan, and reddish-brown; black hair tips that darken with age and can also have white, white with red, or dark markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Norwegian Elkhound</h2><p>Of the Norwegian breeds, the elkhound is the most well-known and familiar. The breed has an ancient history and can even be found referenced in Norse history and mythology. They traveled on Viking ships and acted as herders and protectors of livestock on remote farms in rural, harsh-climate Norway, protected by their thick double-coat.</p><p>Elkhounds are best-suited for an active home environment where they can expend significant amounts of energy. An elkhound isn't a velcro dog. They're steadfastly loyal to their family but are independent and aloof with strangers. Early and appropriate socialization is essential to prevent them from becoming too reserved. This breed is a big-time shedder, dropping its winter coat (everywhere) twice a year.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: around 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 48 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, smooth double coat that comes in shades of silver and black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Hygen Hound</h2><p>Bj rn Konestabo / Wikimedia Commons / Creative Commons License Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)</p><p> </p><p>The Hygen hound was developed in the 1930s by Hans Fredrik Hygen as a high-energy hunting dog that could withstand a harsh arctic terrain's rigors without tiring too quickly. Because of their hunting background, tracking skills, and a strong sense of smell, this breed likes to roam and may require a lot of work to get a reliable recall. Sporting a high prey drive, this breed may not live well alongside small furry pets. Hygens tend to be amiable and friendly with their family but can sometimes exhibit territorial guarding traits. Nip early signs of resource guarding in the bud with positive training methods.</p><p>Even in Norway, the breed is scarce, so it would be unusual to find one of these dogs in North America. If you're attracted to the breed's characteristics, it mirrors other hounds like foxhounds with similar traits.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Scenthound (UKC), not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, straight, glossy coat; comes in a red-brown or a yellow-red with black shading and sometimes with white markings; can also come in black and tan, white with red-brown, and yellow-red markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Norwegian Buhund</h2><p>Jon-Eric Mels ter / Flckr / Creative Commons License Attribution 2.0 Generic (CC BY 2.0)</p><p> </p><p>The Norwegian buhund looks a little like a slightly smaller lundehund, but they have a denser coat and a curly tail that gives them a more traditional spitz appearance. They are also a little more common than lundehunds and may be available by North American breeders.</p><p>Like the elkhound, the buhund traveled on Viking ships and developed into small, adaptable farm dogs that guarded and herded livestock. These intelligent, high-energy, high-stamina dogs need more than a stroll around a park for daily exercise and mental stimulation. Buhunds can be strong-minded and independent. They are loyal, friendly, and playful but are head-strong and sometimes stubborn.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, short, coarse topcoat; comes in black or wheaten coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Halden Hound</h2><p>PxHere </p><p>The Halden hound is another Norwegian scent dog similar to the Hygen hound. They are similar in size and appearance and known for being even-tempered, confident, and eager to please. Like other scent hounds, you may have to work hard on achieving a reliable recall. Haldens have a strong hunting instinct, a keen sense of smell, and often wander off. Unlike spitz-type Norwegian dogs, the Halden's short, smooth coat does not require much grooming.</p><p>The Halden is the rarest of all the Norwegian breeds and is named for a southeastern Norway town. Even in Norway, their numbers are incredibly low, making them a vulnerable breed at risk of extinction.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Scenthound (UKC), not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 19.5 to 23.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coarse, dense, straight, and short double-coated dog; comes in white with black patches; tan shadings on head and legs, and sometimes between the white and the black patches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Dunker (Norwegian Hound)</h2><p>Marten Bjork / Unsplash</p><p>A Dunker, or simply the Norwegian hound, is a medium-sized scenthound bred by Wilhelm Dunker at the beginning of the 19th century for rabbit hunting. It was developed as a scenthound by crossing a Russian harlequin hound with dependable Norwegian scent hounds. It is an uncommon breed outside of Norway.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Scenthound (UKC); not an AKC-recognized breed</p><p>Height: 18.5 to 21.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 39 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Straight, hard, dense, and not too short, commonly black or blue marbled with pale fawn and white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>Climate is the most significant consideration for dogs suited for life in Norway. The average temperature in the winter is below freezing, and during the summer, it's about 65 F. If you want a Norwegian-type of dog, you're looking at a spitz or scenthound. Both types of dogs are hunting, working dogs. Breeds that are not native to Norway include companion lap warmers like Maltese or pugs, thin-coated or hairless hot-weather dogs like Chihuahuas or Xolos, and low-energy breeds like French bulldogs or greyhounds.</p>",1285
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/australian-dog-breeds-4796811,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>9 Australian Dog Breeds for Aficionados</h1>,"<h1>9 Australian Dog Breeds for Aficionados</h1><h2>These canines originated from the land Down Under</h2><p>When you think of Aussie dog breeds, you might think of the hard-working cattle dogs or wild dingoes. As it turns out, quite a few breeds originated from the land Down Under. Although, don't be surprised when you do not find the Australian shepherd listed as a native Australian dog; despite its name, this popular breed originated in the United States.</p><h3>What Is an Aussie Dog?</h3><p>While the term ""Aussie dog"" is commonly used to reference the Australian shepherd, there is a variety of similar dog breeds, like Kelpies, Koolies, and Australian cattle dogs, that are actually native to the continent. Many Australian breeds are working dogs with a high-energy drive suited to homes with active lifestyles.</p><p>If you enjoy adventures in the great outdoors and have the time to offer them the exercise, stimulation, and training that these dogs need, then an Australian working breed could be a great fit for you.</p><p>Here are 10 dog breeds that originated in Australia.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Some people get a dog to go on their runs with them in the morning, while others prefer a pooch that will lounge with them at home. When getting a dog, make sure the breed you choose matches your energy level. Otherwise, you might end up with a depressed or destructive pup.</p><h2>Australian Cattle Dog</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, hard double coat; color is usually blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled; also comes in a less common red speckled variety</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Australian Terrier</h2><p>Like the blue heeler, the Aussie terrier descended from working vermin hunters that came from Britain. Those terriers struggled to cope with the extremes of Australian weather and landscapes. The result was a hardy Aussie terrier full of fearlessness and self-determination in a more rugged little package with an easy-to-maintain coat. They were the first native breed to be officially recognized in Australia. They remain popular today for their people-orientated nature and spunky personality.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Rough outer coat and smooth, shorter undercoat; three main colors are blue and tan, solid sandy, and solid red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 15 years</p><h2>Silky Terrier</h2><p>It's easy to mistake the silky terrier with the more well-known and more miniature Yorkshire terrier. They're closely related: The Yorkie was one of the main breeds that developed the silky in Australia in the early 20th century. This breed is smaller and less rugged than an Aussie terrier and has a fine, long coat similar to a Yorkie. Silkies are people-orientated but are not to be mistaken for lapdogs. They're active, independent, and very bright. True to their terrier lineage, they will require training and an outlet for their desire to dig.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: About 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, straight coat in blue and tan</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 15 years</p><h2>Australian Kelpie</h2><p>Kelpies are a sheep-driving breed that was developed much like the Australian cattle dog. They are descended from Scottish border collies and were crossbred with dingoes to produce a hardier working dog. They share many traits with the Australian cattle dog, but the smaller Kelpie is more mild-mannered, less intense, and not as whip-smart. They aren't suited to a sedentary household. They have a strong desire to herd and work, are incredibly active, and have lots of stamina.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding; not officially recognized by the AKC (as of 2021) but allowed to participate in the herding category for trials (as of 2015)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 45 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Double coat with hard, straight, short, water-resistant topcoat; coat colors come in black, black and tan, red, red and tan, fawn, chocolate, and smoke blue</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Tenterfield Terrier</h2><p>Like the silky and the Aussie terrier, the Tenterfield terrier descended from vermin-killing terriers brought over by British settlers to Australia. This breed closely resembles the Jack Russell or the toy fox terrier and is rare to see outside Australia. These terriers were bred extensively in and around Tenterfield, a New South Wales town. They're closely related to the miniature fox terrier, another Aussie native; the two breeds are easily confused. They are friendly, adaptable, bold, loyal, and playful. These canines often have a high prey drive, an independent streak, and can be feisty. The Australian National Kennel Council recognizes the breed but not the AKC.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (ANKC); not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth, single coat mostly in white with black, tan, or liver markings; tricolors also common</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Dingo</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: None (feral)</p><p>Height: 20 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Can have a thick double coat or a short single coat; most common color is ginger, but options include black and tan and creamy white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years (in captivity)</p><h2>Koolie</h2><p>The Koolie is a working or herding dog existing in Australia since the early 19th century, when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Its name likely derived from ""collie."" It closely resembles border collies. The Koolie is primarily a brilliant herding dog with an instinct to circle widely around sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are silent, upright working dogs. They are patient, loyal, agile, and warm. They are also helpful in minding the flock during lamb-birthing season or wool-collecting time.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized by any kennel clubs</p><p>Height: 16 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 33 to 53 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, medium, and (rarely) long coats; red or blue merle, solid (red, chocolate, or black), or bicolored</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 18 years</p><h2>Miniature Fox Terrier</h2><p>The miniature fox terrier is a small, fine, lightweight working terrier developed as a hunting dog and vermin chaser. In Australia, it's called the mini foxie. It closely resembles the American toy fox terrier, the Jack Russell, or rat terrier. It was bred to root out rats. It's agile, fast, and fun-spirited. It makes a great pet for families with children and the elderly.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized by any kennel clubs</p><p>Height: 9.5 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, fine coat; black, white, brown and tan</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 18 years</p><h2>Bull Arab</h2><p>Commonly called the Australian pig dog, the bull Arab is a pig-hunting dog developed to locate pigs from miles away, pull them to the ground, and hold them down by the ear. The name was derived from its descendants, bull terriers and sighthound saluki, a Middle Eastern dog. It's medium to large in size, short-haired, and muscular. Bull Arabs are loyal family dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized by any kennel clubs</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 92 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, short coat; predominantly white with patches of colors, including include liver (with a red nose), black, red, buckskin, blue, silver, tan, and brindle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>Most Australian breeds are best-suited to active people who hit the trails and cover lots of ground. These high-energy dogs might not be ideal for first-time dog owners or people with a more sedentary lifestyle. If you're looking for an Australian-type dog, then you want a high-energy pup. Avoid lower-energy dogs that prefer sitting in a lap most of the day, such as Cavalier King Charles spaniels, Chihuahuas, or dachshunds.</p>",1222
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-breeds-that-drool-4776096,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>10 Dog Breeds That Drool the Most</h1>,"<h1>10 Dog Breeds That Drool the Most</h1><p>Some dog breeds naturally drool more than others. In particular, the dogs with large and jowly cheeks and lips where lots of saliva can gather tend to be profuse droolers. For some people, this just adds to the dog's character. And for others, they can't imagine anything worse than having to clean up globs of dog slobber every day. This is why it's important to know what you're getting into when it comes to a particular breed's traits.</p><p>Here are 10 dog breeds that are known for their drooling capabilities.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Excessive drooling can sometimes be a sign of an underlying problem. Dogs can drool more when they are stressed or too hot. Drooling can also be a sign of dental problems, an allergic reaction, or nausea. If your dog is not normally an excessive drooler or other worrisome symptoms accompany the sudden excessive drooling, seek veterinary advice.</p><h2>Saint Bernard</h2><p>These jowly gentle giants originated in the Swiss Alps. Saint Bernards are lovable, protective, and loyal companions, and despite their imposing size, they can be excellent with children. These dogs thrive in cold climates and don't do well living in hot regions. You might find that they drool even more in hot weather while trying to stay cool.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 to 30 inches (male); 26 to 28 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 140 to 180 pounds (male); 120 to 140 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and smooth or long and silky coat; colors include white with red, brown or brindle markings; a black mask is typically seen</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Dogue de Bordeaux</h2><p>Also referred to as the French mastiff, the Dogue de Bordeaux is another big dog with high slobber potential. These dogs are loyal and generally playful and docile with their families. But they are powerful and have a strong protective instinct, so training and socialization are a must. The Dogue de Bordeaux is a brachycephalic (short-nosed) breed prone to overheating. This facial structure contributes to the breed's wrinkly, jowly muzzle, which can be a gathering spot for slobber.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches (male); 23 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 110 pounds and up (male); 99 pounds and up (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short muzzle with wrinkles; short coat in various shades of fawn, ranging from light to dark red; small patches of white may be present</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 8 years</p><h2>Bloodhound</h2><p>Famous for their highly sophisticated sense of smell, their droopy look, and their docile temperament, bloodhounds are also expert droolers. Their natural scenting instinct and sometimes stubborn nature mean you might have to work harder on training. But they still make gentle companions and are well suited to family life. Bloodhounds have long, wrinkled faces with very loose skin around their mouth, and they can store a lot of saliva in those cheek pockets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (male); 23 to 25 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 90 to 110 pounds (male); 80 to 100 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Folds of skin across the body and particularly around the face; short, smooth coat; comes in black and tan, liver and tan, and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Bulldog</h2><p>Often called the English or British bulldog, this breed is instantly recognizable due to its wrinkled brow and somewhat grumpy expression. Looks can be deceiving though, as bulldogs tend to be very sweet and full of character. Unfortunately, bulldogs are more prone to health issues than the average dog. Their short, wrinkled snout makes them susceptible to respiratory issues, and they are prone to overheating. Their short face also gives rise to an increase in slobber.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 pounds (male); 40 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, fine coat; comes in several different colors; skin folds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Newfoundland</h2><p>This iconic Canadian large dog breed is renowned for its drooling capabilities. Newfoundlands are also known for being calm and affectionate family members with a great love of the water. The Newfie's large size and high shedding, combined with its slobbery chops, mean you could be in for a lot of cleaning if you have one of these dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 inches (male); 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 130 to 150 pounds (male); 100 to 120 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, thick double coat; comes in brown, black, gray, or black and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 10 years</p><h2>Neapolitan Mastiff</h2><p>The Neapolitan mastiff is another giant breed that has unconditional love toward its family. These dogs are quite protective though, and they can be wary of strangers. So early and consistent training and socialization are key. Neapolitans have a lot of excess skin along their body with very large and droopy jowls. This does give rise to lots of drool from this massive canine.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 26 to 31 inches (male); 24 to 29 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 150 pounds (male); 110 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: An abundance of loose skin across the body; short coat that comes in black, blue, mahogany, and tawny</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 9 years</p><h2>Bernese Mountain Dog</h2><p>Like the Saint Bernard, the Bernese mountain dog is another giant, fluffy breed with a gentle temperament and a tendency to drool. Berners can make great family dogs that act as gentle protectors of children without showing excessive guarding traits. They are another breed that thrives in cold weather. And staying at a comfortable temperature will help to minimize the amount they drool.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 25 to 27.5 inches (male); 23 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 80 to 115 pounds (male); 70 to 95 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat that is tricolor (jet black base color with white and tan markings)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 10 years</p><h2>Bullmastiff</h2><p>While the powerful bullmastiff has its origins as a dog that guarded against poachers in 19th century England, today it's known for being a protective and gentle family dog. This guarding trait does mean bullmastiffs need early and consistent training and socialization to prevent their instinct from becoming a problem. The breed has many facial skin folds, which lead to pooled saliva and lots of drool.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (male); 24 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 110 to 130 pounds (male); 100 to 120 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Facial folds; short and dense coat in fawn, red, or brindle colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 9 years</p><h2>Boxer</h2><p>The often goofy boxer is known for being loyal, fun-loving, full of energy, and friendly. Boxers are another brachycephalic breed, and their short snout and fairly long jowls mean they are prone to slobbering. They aren't always as prolific with their salivating as breeds such as the Saint Bernard or bullmastiff. But you do still need to be prepared for some cleanup.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 23 to 25 inches (male); 21 to 23 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 65 to 80 pounds (male); 50 to 65 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, shiny, smooth coat that is most commonly fawn or brindle but occasionally white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Great Dane</h2><p>The Great Dane is one of the most popular giant dog breeds. These dogs tend to make loving, easygoing family companions if you have the space for them. They are known for being people pleasers and form strong bonds with their family, including children, with whom they are generally very gentle. But the jowls on these big dogs can create lots of slobber, so be ready with a towel.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 30 to 32 inches (male); 28 to 30 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 140 to 175 pounds (male); 110 to 140 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat in brindle, fawn, blue, black, harlequin (white with black patches), or mantle (black and white)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 10 years</p>",1249

Several factors go into determining a dog's intelligence, including word comprehension, problem-solving capabilities, responsiveness to training, communication skills (with humans and other animals), memory, and ability to predict human behavior. The most intelligent dog breeds typically score high in all of these categories.<br/></p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Dogs learn best with positive reinforcement, such as a treat or praise. When you make training seem like a fun game, a dog is more likely to stay engaged for longer and learn what you're trying to teach it.</p><h3>Breed Characteristics</h3><p>Most smart dogs also are high-energy dog breeds. They need lots of mental and physical stimulation to prevent them from getting bored. Otherwise they might find their own activities to entertain themselves that aren't always ideal, such as tearing up your sofa. Still, these dogs can pick up training quickly and often make excellent working dogs and service animals. They enjoy doing a job that allows them to use their brains.</p><p>Here are 10 of the smartest dog breeds.</p><h2>Border Collie</h2><p>The border collie is often considered the smartest of all dogs and the overachiever of the canine world. Originally bred as a herding dog, border collies can perform just about any job you give them. Extremely energetic, athletic, and driven, they are always up for learning something new. In fact, if you don't keep them constantly moving and working, they might start getting destructive in the home. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 48 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Rough or smooth medium-length double coat; body is slightly longer than it is tall; long head that comes to a point at the nose with ears standing erect and tips curling over</p><h2>Australian Shepherd</h2><p>The Australian shepherd is bright, active, and friendly. Its background as a herding dog has made this breed a diligent worker that desires physical activity and mental challenges. The Aussie is a fast learner and always looking for a new challenge. These dogs need to be kept busy with work, or they might become bored and frustrated. Dog sports are ideal for this breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 18 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium to long coat in blue merle, red merle, black, or red; feathering on the back of the legs; generous mane around the neck</p><h2>Poodle</h2><p>Toy, miniature, or standard in size, the poodle is gifted with some of the best canine brainpower. Poodles originated as hunting dogs and continue to be diligent workers and trusty companions. They can easily learn even the most complex tricks. For instance, you can teach a poodle to balance on a ball, jump through a hoop, or work as a service dog.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Standard: 15 inches; miniature: 10 to 15 inches; toy: 10 inches and under</p><p>Weight: Standard: 45 to 70 pounds; miniature: 15 to 18 pounds; toy: 5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Curly, dense, single-layer coat that may be one of many solid colors, including white, black, gray, brown, and apricot</p><h2>Australian Cattle Dog</h2><p>The Australian cattle dog is an extremely focused and driven dog breed that forms a close bond with its owner. This dog was bred to herd cattle and is happiest with a job to do. Without stimulation, it might find undesirable ways to keep busy (e.g., destructive behavior or wandering away to explore). But like most smart dogs, cattle dogs are very good at reading people and will often be able to anticipate their humans' next move.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Powerful, muscular body; short, dense double coat; wide-set, erect ears; feet are small and round with short toes; long tail is held down and curves upward</p><h2>German Shepherd</h2><p>The German shepherd is a loyal, protective breed that has so much energy and intelligence that it sometimes comes across as high-strung or anxious. German shepherds need a job to do. Something as simple as supervising and protecting children can give this breed a sense of purpose. These dogs generally pick up training fast and thrive on performing tasks for their humans.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 100 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large, athletic build; double coat comprising a thick undercoat and a dense, slightly wavy or straight outer coat; tan and black or red and black coloring</p><h2>Shetland Sheepdog</h2><p>The Shetland sheepdog is always watching its environment, eager to learn or waiting for a signal from you to engage in a task. Shelties are very good at reading people and can easily understand the behaviors that are expected of them. They tend to form close bonds with their owners and are extremely responsive to training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 13 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 25 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Outer coat of coarse fur; soft, dense undercoat; full mane; feathering on the legs and tail</p><h2>Papillon</h2><p>Don't let the papillon's delicate frame fool you; this is more than a lap dog. These little dogs are friendly, alert, and active. They might snuggle in your lap for a bit but then will be looking for something interesting to do. Like many small dogs, the papillon has a bit of a stubborn streak. However, if you make training worthwhile (with high-value rewards), then the dog will learn quickly.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Straight, long, single-layer coat; erect ears; alert demeanor</p><h2>Rottweiler</h2><p>The Rottweiler is an expert at reading people by studying body language and facial cues. These dogs are typically very affectionate and playful with people they know but might be more controlled and stoic with strangers. Rotties can be trained fairly easily once you earn their trust. They can learn to perform many actions and will always keep an eye on the environment to make sure everyone is safe. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 80 to 130 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large, muscular body; short, somewhat coarse but shiny black coat; clearly defined rich tan facial markings</p><h2>Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>The Jack Russell terrier, along with the closely related Parson Russell terrier, is a fearless, energetic dog with a sharp wit and a stubborn streak. Because of their energy and brainpower, these terriers excel at dog sports, such as agility. Their desire to keep moving can make training challenging at first. But keep them motivated with rewards, and you will see how many complex tricks these dogs can learn.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Square, compact build; head is small and blocky with almond-shaped dark eyes and dropped ears set high; slim, erect tail</p><h2>Golden Retriever</h2><p>On the surface, the golden retriever might just seem like a happy, goofy dog. But goldens are both smart and huge people-pleasers and thus excel in training. These traits make golden retrievers excellent as service animals. The breed also excels in dog sports. Above all, the golden can learn to fit in to many different types of households.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 21 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, muscular frame; broad head; light to dark golden coat; friendly and intelligent eyes</p><h3>Breeds to Avoid</h3><p>If you are expecting your dog to learn complicated tricks or reliably engage in a job, then there are some dog breeds you might want to avoid. It's not that these breeds are dumb. They just might be hard to train or tend to have an independent, stubborn streak. Some breeds that are often difficult learners include the Afghan hound and Pekingese. Dogs that are generally more aloof and independent include the basenji, borzoi, and shiba inu.</p>",1229

However, it's often synonymous with all the Nordic countries, including Finland, Iceland, and its territories. The Nordic Kennel Union officially recognizes 29 native breeds. They were primarily used for hunting or livestock management. These hardy, tenacious Scandanavian dog breeds adapted well to cold weather conditions and harsh terrain.</p><p>Here are 10 of the most well-known Nordic dogs.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you're drawn to one of these breeds, you'll need to consider whether you can offer the right type of home and lifestyle to meet their needs. Most are high-energy, are work-oriented, and crave activity and enrichment to keep them motivated and happy.</p><h2>Finnish Lapphund</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, harsh double coat in a variety of colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Broholmer</h2><p>One of five breeds native to Denmark, the large mastiff-type Broholmer has been around for hundreds of years. Its size and strength meant it was a popular guard dog for large manors and estates. The Broholmer is known for being a docile and affectionate giant. Although they're watchful and powerful, they make a great family pet with proper training and socialization. After World War II, the Broholmer faced extinction, but a dedicated group of breed enthusiasts worked to save the breed. Although rarely seen outside of Denmark, Broholmer numbers are growing.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Molossian (FCI); not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 25 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 85 to 150 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, thick double coat; commonly yellow with a black mask; can also come in red shades or black with some white on paws, tail, and chest</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 12 years</p><h2>Finnish Spitz</h2><p>The Finnish spitz might not be as well known as the Lapphund, but these little dogs are full of character nonetheless. Hunters traditionally used them to sound the location of birds hidden in trees. If you're looking for a quiet breed, then strike Finkies from your list. They're often champion barkers. They have strong hunting instincts, which also makes recall difficult. They have a strong prey drive, so they are not suitable to have around other small pets. Smart, independent, energetic, and fun-loving, Finkies often make enthusiastic running or hiking partners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 15.5 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 32 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length dense double coat that comes in shades of red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Icelandic Sheepdog</h2><p>The Icelandic sheepdog is the island country's only native breed. Their descendants were brought to Iceland by Viking settlers. Farmers used these hardy, intelligent dogs to herd and protect livestock roaming the harsh, sparsely populated landscapes. The breed is fun-loving, affectionate, and highly trainable. These dogs drip stamina, drive, and athleticism and are best suited for an active home that can offer them plenty of physical and mental enrichment. As a family dog, its herding instincts have to be managed, and the breed can be rather vocal.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long or short double coat that's thick and weatherproof; typical colors are tan, brown, gray, and black; white markings always accompany the main color</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Karelian Bear Dog</h2><p>Uusijani / Wikimedia Commons / CC0 1.0</p><p>The Karelian bear dog, an ancient breed traditionally used for big game hunting, is well-known in its native Finland. Although they're pretty rare in the U.S., wildlife agencies use these intelligent, courageous dogs in national parks to minimize human and bear conflict. While Karelians are intensely loyal and protective, they can be territorial and wary of strangers. They're not always suited to living in multi-dog homes; carefully manage introductions with new dogs. Another active breed, a Karelian will not thrive in a sedentary household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 19 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Very thick coat with a harsh, straight outer layer and soft, dense undercoat; always black with white markings, although the black can have shades of brown through it</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><p><br/></p><h2>Norwegian Elkhound</h2><p>The Norwegian elkhound is the most well-known breed originating from Norway. It has an ancient history, believed to be a Viking dog. It also resembles dogs in Norse mythology. They get their name from the big game they used to hunt. Elkhounds also guard and herd the livestock of remote Norwegian farms. They have great endurance and energy and aren't suited to apartment living with inactive owners. Loyal and friendly to their family, this breed still has an independent spirit and can be wary of strangers. Their thick, shedding coat also needs regular brushing.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: Around 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 48 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, smooth double coat in shades of silver</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Norwegian Lundehund</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 12 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Harsh short topcoat and a dense, soft undercoat; colors include fallow, tan, and reddish-brown; black hair tips darken with age and can also have white, white with red, or dark markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Norwegian Buhund</h2><p>Jon-Eric Mels ter / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>Another dog with Viking heritage, the spitz-type Norweigian buhund was an adaptable and reliable little farm dog. This fun-loving, affectionate, and sweet-tempered breed is a devoted family companion. Another smart and energetic dog, it won't be satisfied with a quick walk around the neighborhood. It needs lots of in-home entertainment and exercise. You'll need to stay on your toes when it comes to training, too. Buhunds are smart, but they can also be independent and stubborn. Keep them motivated with tasty treats and short, fun sessions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, short, coarse topcoat in black or wheaten coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Swedish Vallhund</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 35 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Dense coat in gray and red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Samoyed</h2><p>You may be surprised to see the Samoyed on this list. Admittedly, the breed originated in Siberia. In the late 1960s, the breed standard was assigned to the Nordic Kennel Union and added to the Nordic breeds list. The Samoyed's beautiful thick coat, smiling expression, and gentle temperament are famous the world over. This breed hasn't deviated much from its origins as a hunter, herder, and sled dog for the semi-nomadic Siberian people. Sammies have a thick, heavy shedding coat and can withstand the coldest temperatures. They're also known for being pack dogs and form strong bonds with their family. This breed is best suited for a household with people home most of the day because they are prone to separation anxiety.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 19 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Water-resistant coat; usually white in color but can occasionally also be cream or light brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>A lot of the Nordic breeds are very rare, even within their native countries. They may not be so easy to come across in North America. However, if you're looking for a dog like the active Scandinavian canines, steer clear of dogs that prefer to be couch potatoes. These lower-energy breeds include mastiffs, Pekingese, and bulldogs.</p>",1205

Most of the Welsh breeds have strong working drives and tend to be energetic. A majority will be best suited to homes that enjoy leading an active lifestyle. Several breeds have gone extinct over the past century, but seven from Wales in the western part of the United Kingdom continue to thrive.</p><p>Corgis are the most popular of the Welsh dog breeds. Short legs and fluffy butts aside, the history of these hardworking herding dogs dates back to 1107, when the Vikings brought their furry descendants to the Pembrokeshire area of Wales. This dog is one of the world's oldest (and shortest) herding dogs.</p><p>Here are seven Welsh dogs that live on in the hearts, minds, and homes in Wales and the rest of the world.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Most of the Welsh dogs were bred to do tasks; most of them are energetic, driven, and thrive on running exercise and challenges. Before you get a dog, make sure you can meet that particular dog's physical and mental needs, or else you might end up with a canine buddy that gets depressed or destructive around the house.</p><h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 24 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length double coat in black and tan, red, sable, or fawn with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Welsh Springer Spaniel</h2><p>Welsh Springer Spaniels are close relatives of the more popular English Springer Spaniel. The distinctive red and white dog was explicitly developed during the 18th century by gentry using hunting dogs on their estates. They're enthusiastic, driven, strong swimmers, and have keen noses. They make great family dogs if you lead an active, outdoorsy lifestyle. These dogs need lots of exercise and enrichment, and they could be rather bouncy for a family with young children. Welshies form strong attachments to their people and become prone to separation anxiety if left alone for long stretches.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 19 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Soft, straight, flat coat, with some feathering; red with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h2><p>FatFairfax / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0</p><p>The Cardigan Welsh corgi hails from the coastal Cardiganshire region of the country and was prized for its herding and guarding qualities. Unlike its Pembroke corgi relatives, the Cardigan has a long, full tail, and they're also bigger and heavier set and come in more coat colors. Cardigans are affectionate and playful with their families, but they can be prolific barkers and wary around strangers. They are clever, food-orientated dogs, and most respond well to positive reinforcement training methods.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 10.5 to 12.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 38 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, dense, water-resistant double coat that comes in red, sable, brindle, black or blue merle, with or without white markings on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, tail, and face</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Welsh Terrier</h2><p>The Welsh terrier is an old terrier breed that rose in popularity during the 18th century for being versatile, tenacious, determined vermin catchers. They were popular with hunters and farmers in the rugged Welsh countryside. These little dogs have big, spunky personalities and aren't the best choice for a novice dog owner, unless you're up for a challenge and will be dedicated to training. They are energetic, assertive, independent, and playful, requiring plenty of exercise and enrichment. They have a high prey drive and may not be suited to living with small furries.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: Around 15 inches</p><p>Weight: Around 20 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Dense, hard, wiry coat with a soft and short undercoat; tan and black markings, but shading can vary</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Sealyham Terrier</h2><p>Okforlicz / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 4.0</p><p>Sealyhams, although once very popular, are now one of the rarest of all terrier breeds. They were developed in the 19th century by the owner of Sealyham House in Wales, who wanted a small, tenacious, hardy dog that could support his otterhounds in flushing out pesky otters from their riverside lairs; they were depleting the rivers of fish. They're affectionate, playful, and low-energy with a low-shedding coat. They exhibit typical terrier stubbornness, are prone to guarding behavior, and have a high prey drive. Their popularity soared in the United States in the mid-20th century when Hollywood celebrities, like Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant, were Sealy owners. Over the years, their popularity has diminished, making them an endangered native breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: Around 10.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 21 to 24 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Small, muscular, sturdy and low-set; broad head and full beard; soft, thick undercoat and hard, wiry topcoat which usually comes in all white or with lemon, tan, or badger markings around the ears and face</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Welsh Sheepdog</h2><p>The Welsh sheepdog is a herding breed common to north and central Wales. Unlike other herding dogs, they can work independently, without the guidance of a shepherd. They can corral sheep, goats, pigs, and horses over the countryside. Border collies have become popular in the region and have driven down the numbers of the breed. A unique quality of Welsh sheepdogs is that they are described as loose-eyed, not fixing the stock with their gaze like the strong-eyed border collie. Loose-eyed dogs control the herd with their presence rather than their intense, fixed stare. The Welsh Sheepdog Society formed in 1997 to resurrect the breed and keep the population healthy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized</p><p>Height: 16.5 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 36 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short or long coat, often with a dense undercoat; colors include black, tan, red, and blue merle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Welsh Hound</h2><p>The Welsh hound is a native breed to the British Isles; it looks like an English foxhound. From medieval times through the early part of the 20th century, bards sang odes praising the hounds' qualities. The Welsh hound is a scent hunting dog that hunts in packs and has adapted to the rocky, mountainous terrain in Wales. It is fast, has endurance, and can almost ""talk"" by using specific vocalizations with the pack and the hunter. Although fox hunting is now banned, the breed still participates in drag hunting, a manufactured form of hunting (without killing a fox at the end). A calm and friendly breed, they also make good house pets. They are hard to train and require consistency and firm guidance but are extremely loyal, gentle, and tolerant of small children and other animals.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Scenthound (UKC); not recognized by the AKC</p><p>Height: 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 75 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coat is hard and wiry, red with white patches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 13 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>Welsh dogs have shared traits: They are spritely, intelligent, and purpose-driven. The opposite of Welsh dogs are low-maintenance breeds that need minimal exercise and prefer sleeping the day away, including chihuahuas, mastiffs, and French bulldogs. Perhaps more aptly described as lapdogs and couch potatoes, these dogs still require exercise and companionship but are less stressed than other breeds if they don't get constant attention and tons of outdoor time.</p>",1199

Here are the seven types of dog breeds, their histories, and what pet owners can expect when taking one of these four-legged friends home.</p><p>A quick note about training. While dogs do have breed tendencies, all will require positive training to help them reach their full potential and to fit most happily into any home.</p><h2>Sporting Group</h2><p> </p><p>Dogs in the sporting group were bred to be a hunter's best sidekick; their purpose is to assist with catching feathered game. Thanks to the invention of the gun, sporting dogs were developed as hunters found they needed a canine's help with retrieving upland game birds or waterfowl.</p><p>There are four basic types of Sporting dogs: spaniels, pointers, retrievers, and setters. Some of the breeds in this group, such as retrievers, are especially adept at swimming and specialize in waterfowl like ducks, while setters, spaniels, and pointing breeds are known experts in hunting quail, pheasant, and other game birds in the grasslands.</p><p>While these breeds may be known for performing multiple tasks to aid the hunter, typically pointers and setters would identify and mark game by pointing, spaniels would flush game, and retrievers would be in charge of recovering dead and wounded game.</p><p>All of the Sporting Group dogs are characterized by their natural active and alert personalities, stable temperaments, as well as their instincts both in the water and out in the woods. Sporting dogs make lovable, well-rounded pets, and are the perfect addition to active families, as these energetic, alert dogs will require plenty of exercise and time spent outdoors.</p><p></p><h2>Hound Group</h2><p> </p><p>Originally, dogs in the Hound Group were also used for hunting and classified as Sporting Dogs. However, in 1930, the American Kennel Club introduced the Hound Group to include dogs that have specifically been bred to pursue warm-blooded quarry, such as rabbits, raccoons, or even antelope!</p><p>Though Hounds share their astute hunting skills, this group encompasses a diverse array of breeds. Scent hounds are responsible for using their acute sense of smell to track game, while sighthounds typically rely more heavily on a larger field of vision and speed to hunt.</p><p>While it's difficult to make generalizations about such a diverse group of dogs, generally, the charming, affectionate dogs in this group will make loyal companions and family pets, and some will require more vigorous exercise than others. According to the American Kennel Club, ""members of the Hound Group possess strong prey drives and often will stop at nothing to catch their quarries.""</p><p></p><h2>Toy Group</h2><p>In existence for centuries, the toy breed was bred for the purpose of serving as companions for their humans. These small, easily portable dogs can be most often found sitting in the lap of their humans or being carried around. Ideal for apartment living or anyone with limited space, many of these dogs have been bred down from their larger cousins.</p><p>The breeds categorized in the Toy group tend to be affectionate and easily adaptable to their family's environment. They are intelligent, sociable, and full of energy, and despite their small stature, many do have strong protective instincts and big personalities.</p><p></p><h2>Non-Sporting Group</h2><p>A group for dogs that don't quite fit in anywhere else, the Non-Sporting Group encompasses a variety of breeds with jobs that don't satisfy the requirements of the other six groups. The AKC originally registered dogs as either Sporting or Non-Sporting, and over time, hounds and terriers were separated from the Sporting Group while Toy and Working dogs developed from the Non-Sporting. There was eventually a separate category to distinguish Herding dogs from Working dogs.</p><p>The Non-Sporting Group are all the dogs that remain, and thus have a variety of sizes, functions, and history. Most of these dogs make generally good house dogs and watchdogs, but with breeds ranging from the French Bulldog to the Poodle, their differences are so vast that it makes it difficult to generalize their individual traits.</p><p></p><h2>Working Group</h2><p>The Working Group dogs split off from the Non-Sporting Group, due to their roles of performing specific jobs related to guarding property or performing rescues. Arguably, the hardiest breeds in the canine community, dogs that are categorized into the Working Group have historically been responsible for tasks ranging from pulling sleds and carts to guarding flocks and homes.</p><p>While the appearances and jobs of the dogs in this group vary, most are powerful and intelligent, and can be relied on to perform rescues and any other tasks to protect their families. These dogs include farm and draft animals, security, police, and military dogs, as well as guide and service dogs. As such, they make dependable, loyal pets with incredible intelligence and energy.</p><p></p><h2>Herding Group</h2><p>Categorized by the AKC in 1983, the Herding Group includes the breeds with possibly the most straightforward task. Once included with the Working Group dogs, the group includes 30 breeds in a wide variety of sizes, from the Corgi to the German shepherd.</p><p>Herding dogs have historically been bred to gather, herd, and protect livestock, and work closely with human shepherds. The intelligence and natural responsiveness of these dogs makes them highly trainable. Additionally, they tend to be affectionate and loyal companions. Most of these breeds are happiest in homes that can provide lots of exercise, structure, and clear instruction about expected behavior. Because they are usually very intelligent, they will often become bored and need mental stimulation, as well as physical.</p><p></p><h2>Terrier Group</h2><p>The vast majority of the dogs in the Terrier Group originated in the British Isles and evolved with particular duties based upon the geography of their specific area, including killing vermin and guarding their family's home or barn. Most of these dogs were bred for tasks such as hunting small animals including rats, otters, and badgers.</p><p>There are a few variations of terriers; short-legged terriers were bred to pursue rodents underground, while terriers with long legs are able to dig out these creatures rather than burrowing in after them. ""Bull"" breeds were once created for bull baiting and dogfights, but, happily, are now some of today's go-to companion dogs.</p><p>All of these dogs share the common trait of self-confidence and courage, as they are determined to do what it takes to locate its quarry, no matter the terrain. Dogs in the Terrier Group tend to be energetic and feisty. While they do make lovable pets, they tend to have strong personalities and some breeds may require special grooming.</p><p></p><p>Any dog breeds with a double coat huskies, terriers, German shepherds, etc. should never be shaved.</p><p>So many! The list includes Basenji, Akita, shiba inu, Chow Chow,</p><p>Norwegian Buhund, Samoyed, Finnish Spitz, and Pomeranians.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Among the dogs that howl are several hound breeds, beagles, Alaskan Malamutes, basset hounds, bloodhounds, American Eskimo dogs, and huskies.</p>",1133

Several of these English dog breeds were developed for their working skills. This included hunting, retrieving, and pest extermination. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, bred to excel at their intended jobs. Their temperaments also vary, with some typically being quite active and athletic and others being much calmer.</p><p>Here are 10 popular dog breeds that have English roots.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Many English dog breeds are easy to find at local animal shelters across the United States. You also can look for a breed-specific rescue or a reputable breeder.</p><h2>Bulldog</h2><p>Bulldogs can be traced back all the way to the 13th century in England. Thanks to their powerful physique, they were used for the blood sport of bullbaiting in which a pack of dogs would fight a staked bull. Once this sport was banned in the 1800s, bulldogs were used for illegal dog fighting. The breed also was crossed with other terriers. Breeders have since refined the dog's appearance, making it squatter with a flatter face and more wrinkles than its ancestors. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 pounds (male); 40 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, fine coat; comes in several different colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Beagle</h2><p>In the 1500s, English hunters had both large hounds for deer and small hounds for rabbits. Beagles descended from those small hounds. And by the 1800s these small hounds were being bred not only for their hunting prowess but also their desirable friendly appearance. English breeders preferred a larger variety to hunt foxes while Americans developed a slightly smaller beagle to hunt rabbits. There are still two size varieties recognized today.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: Two varieties: up to 13 inches; 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: Two varieties: under 20 pounds; 20 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Close, hard, medium-length coat; colors include tricolor (tan, black, and white), red and white, lemon and white, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Yorkshire Terrier</h2><p>The Yorkshire terrier has its roots in the English counties Yorkshire and Lancashire, dating back to the 1800s. It's thought to be a mix of some terrier breeds from Scotland, including the Skye and Dandie Dinmont. It also might have some Maltese in it. Early Yorkies were used as rodent exterminators, especially in textile mills and coal mines. But they quickly won the hearts of the elite as well, becoming desirable lapdogs. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 7 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Silky coat; colors include black and tan, blue and tan, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 15 years</p><h2>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h2><p>In the 17th century, King Charles I and Charles II both were fond of a small type of spaniel with a black-and-tan coat. This spaniel remained popular with British aristocrats into the 19th century when it was crossed with small Asian dog breeds, giving it a flatter face and domed skull. Then, in the 1920s, breeders attempted to recreate the original version of the little spaniel based on old portraits of the dogs in English manors, resulting in the Cavalier.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC)</p><p>Height: 12 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 18 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, silky coat; feathering around the legs, ears, chest, and tail; colors include black and tan, black and white, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>English Springer Spaniel</h2><p>For centuries in England, both ""cocker"" and ""springer"" spaniels (early versions of today's spaniel breeds) could be born in the same litter. The springers were larger dogs, used to flush or ""spring"" birds and other game from their hiding spots for hunters. In the 1800s, breed standards developed for several spaniel types, and by 1902 the English springer spaniel was officially recognized in England. Today's breed still retains that exceptional hunting ability.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 20 inches (male); 19 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 50 pounds (male); 40 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Long coat with feathering on the chest, ears, stomach, and legs; colors include black and white, liver and white, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Bullmastiff</h2><p>In the 1800s, poachers were targeting the country estates of English aristocrats. In response, a huge, athletic, and courageous dog was developed that could catch and pin down any invading poacher. This dog was a mix of bulldogs and mastiffs hence the name bullmastiff. It was large enough to be intimidating yet smart and loyal enough to follow commands. Bullmastiffs today still can be skeptical of strangers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (male); 24 to 26 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 110 to 130 pounds (male); 100 to 120 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Facial folds; short and dense coat in fawn, red, or brindle colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 to 9 years</p><h2>English Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>The earliest English cocker spaniels were born into the same litters as the larger springer spaniels. This smaller type specialized in hunting woodcock, hence its name. As spaniel breeds became solidified in the 19th century, the breed standard developed for the English cocker. Then, in the early 20th century, American breeders developed an even smaller cocker spaniel with a smaller head and more prominently domed skull.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 17 inches (male); 15 to 16 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 28 to 34 pounds (male); 26 to 32 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Silky; medium-length; feathering on ears, legs, and chest; comes in many colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Airedale Terrier</h2><p>Airedale terriers can trace their roots to Aire Valley in Northern England. In the 1800s, factory and mill workers bred these large terriers to be smart, tough, and fearless hunting dogs. The otterhound, multiple terrier types, and potentially setters, retrievers, and herders all went into the Airedale's makeup. This created a versatile dog that was good with game on land and in water.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Wiry, dense, straight, short topcoat; softer undercoat; head and ears are tan; body is a mix of tan and black or grizzle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 14 years</p><h2>Whippet</h2><p>During the 1800s, coal miners in England wanted to take part in hunting and dog racing. However, they couldn't afford to keep large dogs like the greyhound. So they bred a smaller dog that was just as good of an athlete and hunter. It's likely they crossed greyhounds with small but fast terriers, resulting in the swift little whippet. The modern version is still lightning fast and has a strong prey drive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 19 to 22 inches (male); 18 to 21 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat that comes in various colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Bull Terrier</h2><p>Bull terriers share the same ancestors as today's bulldogs. In the 1800s, bulldogs were being crossed with terrier breeds to create strong and spirited fighters (with the terriers providing their fiery demeanor). The bull terrier arose from these crosses and was used in illegal dog fighting. However, it also became a popular companion animal, leading breeders to soften its looks and sweeten its temperament. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat; colors include white, brindle, black and tan, and more</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p>",1178

Regular running can also help keep a dog fit and at a healthy weight. Plus, running with your dog can strengthen your bond. However, not all dogs are able to keep the same pace. Some breeds are known for their superb speed. These swift canines tend to be large, muscular, long-legged breeds, though there are some very speedy small pups, too. They generally were bred for jobs that kept them up on their paws and moving. </p><p>Here are 10 of the fastest dog breeds.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Athletic dogs typically need lots of exercise each day with ample space to get their energy out. If you can't direct their energy to positive outlets, such as canine sports, the dogs might turn to destructive behaviors, such as chewing household items.</p><h2>Border Collie</h2><p>Border collies are generally very smart, energetic, and loyal. They also have tons of stamina, drive, and speed. Whether it's herding livestock all day or competing at top levels in the fast-paced sports of flyball or agility, these dogs really can motor over long distances. However, it's not uncommon for border collies to nip at the heels of running children or chase bikes and cars. So it's important to direct their athleticism to positive tasks.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 48 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Rough or smooth medium-length double coat; body is slightly longer than it is tall; long head that comes to a point at the nose with ears standing erect and tips curling over</p><h2>Dalmatian</h2><p>Dalmatians aren't just known for their striking good looks. They're also seriously speedy and athletic. Historically, they were trained to run alongside horse-drawn carriages. Many new owners underestimate just how much exercise and attention these dogs need. Long walks each day are a must, as is space for the dogs to run. Dalmatians also are known for being enthusiastic alert barkers, so you'll need to put some training in to encourage quieter behavior.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 19 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long body; short, dense coat; white with black or brown spots</p><h2>Doberman Pinscher</h2><p>It's no surprise that the Doberman Pinscher has been used by the military, police, and search-and-rescue services. These large dogs have loads of stamina, drive, and swiftness. Dobermans also are incredibly loyal and trainable. However, they generally aren't suited to novice dog owners. They don't always get along with other dogs, and their strong guarding instincts and powerful physique can become a challenge if not carefully managed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 24 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 100 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular build; deep chest; short, smooth coat in black, red, blue, or fawn with rust markings</p><h2>Great Dane</h2><p>The Great Dane has a large, lanky athletic physique that allows it to cover ground quickly. This is what historically made the breed successful at boar hunting in its native Germany. With their families, Great Danes tend to be gentle giants. They do need a lot of space to play and get their energy out. But they can be quite loving and loyal companions, including with children and other animal family members.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 28 to 32 inches</p><p>Weight: 110 to 175 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular body; deep chest; short and smooth coat; colors include black, blue, brindle, fawn, harlequin, and more</p><h2>Greyhound</h2><p>Greyhounds are often regarded as the fastest dogs on the planet. These streamlined sighthounds were specifically bred with speed in mind. They have deep chests; a large lung capacity; and a lean, muscular physique. Greyhounds are able to accelerate quickly and then maintain high speeds. But they are typically mild-mannered and calm at home, even being referred to as couch potatoes, as long as they've had their walks.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 25 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long legs; athletic, thin body; long, narrow head with pointed muzzle; short, smooth coat in many different solid and brindle colors</p><h2>Siberian Husky</h2><p>Siberian huskies might not hit the blistering speeds a greyhound is capable of, but they're still incredibly fast. This breed has incredible stamina and is able to cover long distances at a consistently brisk pace, even in harsh weather conditions. As you'd expect from a dog bred to pull sleds for hours each day, huskies are full of energy and determination. The breed needs to be part of a family that can offer an outlet for this exuberance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 20 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 60 pounds (male); 35 to 50 pounds (female)</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Thick double coat; comes in a variety of colors, including combinations of black, gray, white, and tan</p><h2>Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>The small but swift Jack Russell terrier was originally bred for fox hunting. Unlike the bigger foxhounds, these tenacious and brave little dogs could chase their quarry into a den. They also had to have the speed and stamina to keep up with the horses when following a scent. These dogs are typically smart, energetic, and playful. They can also be very vocal, prone to digging, and have a high prey drive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Square, compact build; head is small and blocky with almond-shaped dark eyes and dropped ears set high; slim, erect tail</p><h2>Poodle</h2><p>Poodles come in three sizes: toy, miniature, and standard. And all three are known for being fleet of foot. Poodles can make great family pets when given an outlet for their playfulness and energy. They'll need at least a couple solid walks each day. Poodles tend to be fun-loving but also patient and gentle. And they're known for their longevity. But they do have fairly high grooming requirements to prevent their coats from becoming untidy and matted.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Standard: 15 inches; miniature: 10 to 15 inches; toy: 10 inches and under</p><p>Weight: Standard: 45 to 70 pounds; miniature: 15 to 18 pounds; toy: 5 to 9 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Curly, dense, single-layer coat; may be one of many solid colors, including white, black, gray, brown, and apricot</p><h2>Vizsla</h2><p>Hundreds of years ago, the vizsla was prized among the Maygar hunting tribes of Hungary. The breed became indispensable thanks to its unsurpassable pace and endurance when tracking quarry. These days, these qualities are what make vizslas popular running companions. The breed also tends to be eager to please and affectionate. But vizslas are notorious chewers and might turn to this activity if they aren't getting enough exercise or stimulation.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 50 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular build; russet-colored short, smooth, dense coat</p><h2>Weimaraner</h2><p>The Weimaraner is another athletic hunting breed with a scorching turn of pace. These dogs are known for their vigor, loyalty, and trainability. But they can be rather mischievous, so they need lots of mental and physical enrichment to keep them entertained and channel their energy. Plus, they're another breed that likes to chew and can destroy household items if left bored and unsupervised.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 24 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 85 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular build; short, smooth mouse gray or silver gray coat; blocky head with large dropped ears</p>",1150

They might sport a rare coat color or pattern, an uncommon shape to their ears or tail, or even wrinkles across their skin. Several dog breeds are notorious for the rolls their skin makes. These breeds come in many shapes and sizes. Some are very active dogs while others are happier to lounge around the house. And some tend to be friendlier than others, especially around strangers.</p><p>Here are 10 adorable dog breeds with wrinkles.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>While wrinkled skin can give a dog some added charm and character, it also requires special maintenance. It's important to thoroughly wash all those skin folds regularly with a gentle canine shampoo to prevent dirt and bacteria from getting trapped in them. The wrinkles also must be dried well.</p><h2>Shar-Pei</h2><p>The Shar-Pei is originally from China, where the breed was believed to have been a peasant's dog thousands of years ago. Farmers used Shar-Peis as hunters, herders, and guard dogs because of their intelligence and brute strength. Their notable wrinkled skin and regal appearance help them stand out among other breeds. Puppies tend to have more loose skin, which tightens as they mature.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 18 to 20 inches<br/>Weight: 45 to 60 pounds<br/>Physical Characteristics: Compact, medium-size body; short coat with loose skin; small ears; wrinkles on head and back; curled tail; small, sunken eyes</p><h2>Neapolitan Mastiff</h2><p>Dating back centuries, Neapolitan mastiffs were historically bred to be intimidating gladiators in battle. While intruders are right to be afraid of the protective Neapolitan mastiff, with its giant head and massive frame, family members need not worry. This dog is typically a gentle giant around those they love, exhibiting a sweet, calm temperament. Its voluminous folds around its head and loose skin over its body just add to its charm. And its long jowls tend to drip a fair amount of drool.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 24 to 31 inches<br/>Weight: 110 to 150 pounds<br/>Physical Characteristics: Large, powerful body; large, droopy lips and wrinkled head; lionlike stance; short coat; colors include solid gray, black, mahogany and tawny; may have brindle coat pattern</p><h2>Pug</h2><p>If you haven't played with a pug, you're missing out. This Chinese breed is a popular companion for all types of owners and living situations. Pugs are small, relatively low maintenance, and typically very friendly and comedic. Plus, their wrinkled faces and large, expressive eyes make them look perpetually curious. And their curled tails always seem to be wagging.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches<br/>Weight: 14 to 18 pounds<br/>Physical Characteristics: Small but muscular body; short legs; typically fawn-colored with black faces; curled tail; short coat; rounded head; wrinkled face</p><h2>Dogue de Bordeaux</h2><p>The Dogue de Bordeaux, also known as the French mastiff, was bred for its strength and protective nature. Many people love this breed for its intimidating looks in combination with its affectionate personality and fierce loyalty. Its large, muscular build has made it a favorite among soldiers, hunters, and farmers.

They are tough, muscular dogs that also have a friendly, sweet, and calm side. They eventually became companion dogs rather than fighters after the outlaw of blood sports. These dogs are easily recognized by the heavy wrinkles around their face and the loose skin that hangs around their mouth. They also have loose skin across their body.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches<br/>Weight: 40 to 50 pounds<br/>Physical Characteristics: Smooth, short coat; large head; short, stocky body; wrinkled face with loose jowls; colors vary greatly</p><h2>Bloodhound</h2><p>Most people have seen bloodhounds in cartoons and movies, famous for their tracking abilities and often spotted searching for a missing person or helping on a hunt.

Their skin hangs in especially deep folds around their head and neck.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches<br/>Weight: 80 to 110 pounds<br/>Physical Characteristics: Long, droopy ears; loose skin; wrinkled face with loose, flapping lips; standard color combinations include black and tan, liver and tan, and solid red; tall, alert stature</p><h2>French Bulldog</h2><p>The French bulldog is short in stature with a compact, muscular body and petite, rabbit-like ears.

They make great companions for hunters and families alike thanks to their top-notch tracking ability and calm temperament.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 15 inches and under<br/>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds<br/>Physical Characteristics: Short, strong legs and large paws; long, droopy ears; loose skin; wrinkled brow; short, smooth coat; coat color includes combinations of black, white, brown, tan, lemon, mahogany, and red</p><h2>Xoloitzcuintli</h2><p>Because their name is quite a mouthful, Xoloitzcuintli dogs are often called Xolos for short. They also go by the name Mexican hairless dog due to their country of origin and general lack of a full coat. Xolos are loyal watchdogs and loving companions. Their foreheads tend to wrinkle, especially when the dog is attentive or pondering something. But they generally do not have loose skin across their bodies.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 14 inches (toy); 14 to 18 inches (miniature); 18 to 23 inches (standard)<br/>Weight: 10 to 15 pounds (toy); 15 to 30 pounds (miniature); 30 to 55 pounds (standard)<br/>Physical Characteristics: Can be hairless with black skin or coated with short, flat fur; thoughtful expression; forehead is often wrinkled; long muzzle; long, sleek, strong body</p><h2>Pekingese</h2><p>The compact and dignified Pekingese has deep wrinkles on its face, which accentuate its short muzzle.

For instance, if you're considering a working breed, you'll need to be aware that it will likely require more exercise and enrichment than many other dogs. Likewise, a long-haired breed generally needs more grooming than a dog with a short coat. And some dogs' instincts, such as their prey drive, are very hardwired, so you'll have to put in extra training to keep them manageable.</p><p>Here are 10 high-maintenance dog breeds that need some extra attention.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>For dog breeds that are high energy and always looking for a job to do, dog sports, such as agility or flying disc, can be a great option. There also are herding and scent-tracking courses to put your breed's natural instincts to the test.</p><h2>Belgian Malinois</h2><p>If you've ever seen a Belgian Malinois involved in obedience training, police work, or search and rescue, you'll know what smart and driven dogs they are. But a Mali requires a special type of home. If they aren't given the opportunity to put their drive to use, they can become bored, stressed, mouthy, overexcitable, reactive, and overall a big challenge. Dog sports are an ideal match for this canine's energy and work ethic.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular body; short double coat; colors include fawn, mahogany, and red with a black mask</p><h2>Puli</h2><p>The Puli has an incredibly distinctive look. Its unique double coat forms into strands resembling dreadlocks. This makes the dog's grooming regimen quite involved. Unless you're prepared to devote a lot of time to maintain and separate the cords, then this isn't the dog for you. Even bathing a Puli is a project. The cords need to be fully dried after baths to prevent mildew from forming.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 16 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 35 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Square build; naturally corded coat; colors include black, silver, and white</p><h2>Greyhound</h2><p>Greyhounds can make affectionate and easygoing companions. But one factor to be aware of if you're considering a greyhound is the breed's strong prey drive. On walks, these dogs often want to chase wildlife. And in the house, they might not be able to live alongside small furry pets. You'll have to put in a lot of work on recall training, and your dog might only be able to go off leash in secure spaces.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 25 to 30 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long legs; athletic, thin body; long, narrow head with pointed muzzle; short, smooth coat in many different solid and brindle colors</p><h2>Border Collie</h2><p>Border collies excel at herding, but this built-in drive can sometimes manifest itself in a negative way. They might nip at the heels of family members or even chase after cars or bikes. Enrolling them in herding courses is a great way to channel this instinct and get out some of the breed's ample physical and mental energy. Border collies also excel in most other dog sports, as they're athletic and eager to please.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 48 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Rough or smooth medium-length double coat; comes in a variety of colors but most commonly black and white</p><h2>Siberian Husky</h2><p>Siberian huskies are high-intensity, high-endurance dogs developed to have the stamina to cover many miles pulling sleds across the harsh arctic tundra. These dogs have a natural instinct to roam, and they can be unreliable when it comes to recall off leash. They also are notorious escape artists, so you must have a secure high fence to prevent them from scaling it and running loose.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 21 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Dense, plush double coat; ranging from black to white and other colors; erect ears; well-furred tail</p><h2>Beagle</h2><p>Beagles can be quite vocal dogs. They were bred to use their distinctive baying howl to alert their human hunting companions to the scent or sight of their quarry. Some beagles also just vocalize for the love of it, and very little is needed to set off a fit of howls, yelps, whines, and barks. Providing your beagle with lots of exercise and mental stimulation can help to keep it quiet at home. Consistent training also is a must to reward quiet behavior.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 25 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular body; domed skull; squarish muzzle; long floppy ears; perky long tail held upward; short coat in all hound colors, including but not limited to tricolor (tan, black, and white), red and white, and lemon and white</p><h2>Akita</h2><p>The large Japanese Akita is known for being brave, unfailingly loyal, and protective. However, Akitas can be wary of strangers, and they're often intolerant of or even aggressive toward other dogs. Early socialization and training are key to make sure an Akita is good around guests and other dogs. But many will still be best for one-dog households and must be carefully watched when around other dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 24 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 130 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Triangular head; curled tail; thick double coat; colors include black, fawn, red, and more</p><h2>Bulldog</h2><p>Over the years, bulldogs have been bred with a more squat appearance. They have more wrinkles, and their face has become flatter. This selective breeding for appearance has not worked in the breed's favor. Now, bulldogs are often plagued with health problems, including breathing difficulties, overheating, eye disorders, skin conditions, and joint issues. Even if you go to a breeder with a good reputation, be prepared for potential health problems.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 50 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Thick-set body; straight, short, fine-textured, smooth coat; colors include red, white, fawn, and fallow (pale brown); massive, square, short-muzzled head</p><h2>Chow Chow</h2><p>While chow chows can be calm and loyal dogs with their families, they aren't suited for novice dog owners. Chows can be reactive toward other dogs, and they're known for being independent and strong-willed. This can make training a challenge. Consistency, patience, and lots of positive reinforcement are a must when it comes to teaching your dog good behaviors.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue-black tongue; thick, dense double coat that can be rough or smooth; colors include red, black, blue, and more</p><h2>Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>Jack Russell terriers have spunky personalities, and they're quite intelligent and energetic. But their terrier traits can be a challenge. Given their reputation as champion vermin catchers, they often have a high prey drive, and they love to dig. Working on recall training is essential. And you might have to give them a special place to dig unless you're fine with holes around your entire yard.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 13 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Smooth or rough coat; colors include white with black, brown, or tan markings; square compact build; head is small and blocky with almond-shaped dark eyes; dropped ears set high; slim, erect tail</p>",1124

Giant canines come packed with plenty of pluses. They're big softies with sweet, gentle temperaments that think they're lap loungers. They're loyal and protective of their family pack. And they're smart and usually easy to train.</p><p>There are several factors to consider before adopting a large dog breed. Larger dogs require more of everything, from food to larger-scale supplies to higher veterinary care costs. Also, a bigger dog needs a larger living space to move around comfortably.</p><p>Here are 10 of the best giant dog breeds if you're ready for a massive companion.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you're getting a giant dog for a young family, one pill that is hard to swallow (especially for young children) is that massive dogs typically have shorter lifespans than all other dogs. Many only live about six to 10 years, while the average dog lifespan is around 12 to 15 years.</p><h3>Watch Now: 12 Giant Dog Breeds and What Makes Them Special</h3><h2>Great Dane</h2><p>One might say this majestic creature more closely resembles a small horse than a dog. Great Danes stand out in a crowd. Appearance, or in this case, size, isn't what makes it an excellent companion; it is this breed's temperament.

Because of their size, they appear to be goofballs, but it's their larger limbs and plop-anywhere attitude that makes them fun to be around.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 28 to 32 inches</p><p>Weight: 110 to 175 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short hair in brindle, fawn, blue, black, harlequin (white with black patches), or mantle (black and white)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 8 years</p><h2>Mastiff</h2><p>Mastiffs are all brawn on the outside, but they're softhearted, easygoing companions on the inside.

These giant dogs need ample living space and obedience training wherever they go.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 28 inches and up</p><p>Weight: 120 to 230 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short coat; colors include apricot, brindle, and fawn with a black mask</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Leonberger</h2><p>The Leonberger is a massive working dog that typically has a kind, gentle disposition.

But we have one word for you: fluff. It's a scientific fact that some fluff can make literally anything cuter and doggies are certainly no exception. Trust us. We've conducted the in-depth, ""scientific research.""</p><p>From big, fluffy dogs, like Samoyeds to the tiniest fluffy dogs, like Pomeranians, we've rounded up some of the fluffiest, most adorable pooches out there. Plus, if your furry family member is blessed with some fluff, learn some simple grooming tips that will keep his or her coat clean, healthy, and impossibly fluffy. </p><h2>Poodles</h2><p>Poodles are probably best known for their super coifed hairdos but did you know their unique-looking fluff originally served a very specific purpose?</p><p>Before Poodles earned an unfounded reputation as being ""prissy,"" they were often used as hunting and duck dogs, due to their strong swimming skills and ""soft"" mouths. Because they were hopping into freezing cold water to retrieve ducks and birds, their owners would trim their hair in strategic patterns to protect vital body parts from the cold, while reducing the amount of cold, wet fur the Poodle had to carry around. </p><h2>Samoyeds</h2><p>Although Samoyeds are typically known for their super thick, fluffy coats and sweet Sammy smiles, these fluffy dogs aren't all good looks they have some serious history, too.</p><p>Originating in Asia, Samoyeds are believed to be one of the world's oldest dog breeds. Although they were originally bred by the Samoyede people of Persia to hunt, herd animals, and pull sleds, they were considered true members of Samoyede families, too. </p><h2>Chow Chows</h2><p>There's definitely no shortage of adorable photos of Chow Chows' fluffy coats. There are also quite a few pictures showing their massive, toothy grins on the internet. So, it only makes sense that Chows would have an abundance of teeth, too. While most dogs have 42 teeth, Chow Chows have 44. That has to be the explanation for their charming smiles, right? </p><h2>Old English Sheepdogs</h2><p>Although Old English Sheepdogs were originally bred as working dogs in southwestern England, they became symbols of wealth when they first arrived in the United States.</p><p>William Wade, an industrialist from Pittsburgh, first kept Old English Sheepdogs in the 1880s. Then, within 20 years, five of the 10 richest families in the United States owned, bred, and showed Old English Sheepdogs, including the Vanderbilts and Guggenheims. </p><h2>Border Collies</h2><p>Believe it or not, many Border Collies can trace their ancestry back to a single dog named Old Hemp. Born in 1893, Old Hemp's herding technique was seriously impressive so impressive, in fact, that cattle ranchers to propagate his skills. Accordingly, he became a stud dog and fathered over 200 puppies!</p><h2>Pomeranians</h2><p>Today's Pomeranians have a common reputation as being lap pups, teacup dogs, and even purse pooches but back in the day, Pomeranians were actually powerful working dogs that were used to herd animals and pull sleds across snowy terrain.</p><p>Early Pomeranians weighed about 30 pounds but were bred to a smaller size sometime during the 19th century. Now, most Pomeranians weigh between four and seven pounds. </p><h2>Great Pyrenees</h2><p>Great Pyrenees were originally bred to guard livestock in Europe's Pyrenees Mountains, but they're incredibly nurturing, gentle dogs despite their massive size! </p><p>Because they're so calm and loving, Great Pyrenees are often used as therapy dogs in schools, hospitals, and care facilities. Not only are they super sweet, but they're tall enough to reach the edge of a wheelchair or hospital bed for easier petting. </p><h2>Lhasa Apsos</h2><p>In Tibet, where Lhasa Apsos originated, these fluffy dogs are known as Abso Seng Kye, which translates to ""Bark Lion Sentinel Dog."" Pretty badass, right? Lhasa Apsos were often charged with guarding the interiors of Tibetan buildings and would bark to alert their humans of intruders hence the ""bark"" and ""sentinel"" aspects of their name. What's more, Lhasas are linked to the Tibetan Snow Lion, which Tibetans consider the guardian of their country. </p><h2>Affenpinschers</h2><p>Affenpinschers, otherwise known as monkey terriers, were named for their extremely unique appearance. But they were given their nickname, diaboltin moustachu or mustachioed little devil for their playful nature. It's true that Affenpinschers are super smart, loyal, and curious, but the fact that they're terriers can make them a bit excitable. </p><h2>Maltese</h2><p></p><p>Boasting an impressive 2,800-year history, Malteses are believed to be another one of the oldest dog breeds. Over the course of those 2,800 years, Malteses have become fan favorites of royalty around the globe. Not only were they cherished by ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian royalty, but Queen Elizabeth I and Mary Queen of Scots adored them, too. These days, Maltese pups are super popular among Hollywood's royalty. </p><h2>Pekingese</h2><p>It's hard to handle how irresistibly adorable these balls of fluff are. Aside from their impressive coats, Pekingese also have an interesting smushed face similar to that of Pugs or Shih Tzus. There's actually a name for the variety of pups who share this type of face: brachycephalic dogs. Their shortened airways can lead to possible health problems, but with proper care, they can live healthy, happy lives! </p><h2>Newfoundlands</h2><p>Despite their massive size, Newfoundland dogs are nothing but fluffy, gentle giants. They're hardworking, kind, and trustworthy. So much so that Lewis and Clark took one on their expedition across the United States. Seaman happened to be a Newfy and helped keep the team fed by hunting animals throughout the trip. It was also believed that he was stolen at one point during the journey, but then later returned. We can't blame whoever took him these pups are just too cute!</p><h2>Caring for Your Dog's Fluffy Coat</h2><p>When it comes to fluffy dogs, maintaining the cute, fluffiness can come with a price: Fluffy coats require the most maintenance due to their double coats. What's more, if you take your pooch to a professional groomer, trips can add up pretty quickly. </p><p>However, keeping your fluffy dog's coat healthy and full of fluff is possible with the right tools and a little bit of patience.</p><p>Remember: If you want to keep your dog's coat beautiful and healthy, stick to your daily brushing and grooming schedule. Not only will it prevent mats and tangles, but it'll save you some cash at the groomer, too!</p>",1008

70,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dogs-from-belgium-5194600,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>7 Dog Breeds From Belgium</h1>,"<h1>7 Dog Breeds From Belgium</h1><h2>Belgian breeds range from large, sheep-herding dogs to small, feisty ratters.</h2><p>Belgium claims several dog breeds as its own. Historically, many native Belgian dog breeds were working dogs used at one time to herd livestock, guard flocks, and protect the homestead and a few small-sized dogs lent their talents as watchdogs, rat killers, and close companions. </p><p>Read on to meet seven dog breeds from Belgium. </p><h2>Belgian Laekenois</h2><p>The Belgian Laekenois (pronounced lak-in-wah) is one of four related Belgian shepherd dog breeds (the other three are the Belgian Malinois, Belgian Sheepdog and Belgian Tervuren). All of similar size and body type, all four breeds were used to herd and guard livestock, as well protect people and property. In Belgium, they are classified as different varieties of one breed (the Belgian Shepherd Dog), with the main differences between them being coat type and color. The Belgian Laekenois, which is the rarest of the Belgian shepherd breeds, is named for the town of Laeken in the Brussels region. The Laekenois has a distinctive wiry coat, which gives the dog a tousled appearance. The breed is watchful, protective and affectionate with family. In the United States, the Belgian Laekenois is part of the American Kennel Club Herding Group.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 24 to 26 inches (males); 22 to 24 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium length double coat with wiry texture and curly nature</p><p>Coat Color: Red, fawn, or gray with traces of black on muzzle or tail</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Belgian Malinois</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 50 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short double coat in rich fawn to mahogany; mask and ears are black</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 16 years</p><h2>Belgian Sheepdog (Groenendael)</h2><p>The Belgian Sheepdog is the only one of the Belgian shepherd dog breeds with a long, solid black coat. Though the breed is known in the United States as the Belgian Sheepdog, in other parts of the world it is called the Groenendael (pronounced Groan-en-dahl), named for the village of Groenendael, where this Belgian shepherd dog variety was originally bred. The Belgian Sheepdog was used to herd sheep and cattle, as well as working as police and military dogs. Today's Belgian Sheepdog remains incredibly versatile and is trained for police work, search and rescue, as service dogs and therapy dogs, and as competitors in performance sports like obedience, agility, herding, schutzhund, tracking, and more. The Belgian Sheepdog is part of the AKC Herding Group.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds (male), 45-60 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double-coat, black color</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Belgian Tervuren</h2><p>Of the Belgian shepherd breeds, the Belgian Tervuren most closely resembles its cousin, the Belgian Sheepdog (Groenendael). The two breeds have the same long, thick, double coat, but where the Belgian Sheepdog's coat is solid black, the Tervuren's coat comes in various shades of tan, from rich fawn to russet mahogany with black overlay and black mask on the face. The Belgian Tervuren is named for the village of Tervuren, where the breed as it is known today was standardized. Like other Belgian shepherds, the Tervuren needs ample exercise to burn its abundant energy. They demand copious attention and are extremely affectionate with, and even possessive of, their human family. The Belgian Tervuren is part of the AKC Herding Group.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 24 to 26 inches (males); 22 to 24 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds (males); 45 to 60 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Thick, double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Red, fawn, or gray and black, with black muzzle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>Bouvier des Flanders</h2><p>As its name implies, the Bouvier des Flandres hails from the Flanders region of Belgium. Like the Laekenois, Malinois, Belgian Sheepdog, and Tervuren, the Bouvier des Flandres was used to as a livestock herder and all-around farm dog. It's quite a bit larger and more powerful than other herding breeds, with a heavy build. The breed is unmistakable with its tousled rough coat. Unlike some herding breeds, Bouviers tend to be calm and steady rather than ""on"" all the time. Bouviers need early socialization and proper training from an experienced dog owner who can provide enough activity and mental stimulation. The Bouvier des Flandres is part of the AKC Herding Group.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 23.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 70 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, shaggy, rough double coat in black, salt and pepper, gray, fawn, or brindle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Brussels Griffon</h2><p>Though it's the smallest of the breeds native to Belgium, the Brussels Griffon has a big personality. Though the Brussels Griffon started out as a scrappy dog that was used as a ratter in horse stables, the little dog eventually found its way into the laps of royalty, starting with Belgium's Queen Henrietta Maria, who became enamored with the breed in the 1870s. It's no wonder people find it hard to resist the Brussels Griffon's adorably scruffy face, soulful eyes and charming nature. When the queen likes something, it eventually trickles down to the masses, and the Brussels Griffon traded streets and stables for palaces and warm beds. Today's Brussels Griffon is the ultimate lap dog and companion. The breed craves human attention and doesn't do well if left alone for long periods. The Brussels Griffon is part of the AKC Toy Group.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 7 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat and Colors: Smooth coat or rough coat in red, black and tan, solid black, or belge (mix of black and reddish brown)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>Schipperke</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting </p><p>Weight: 10 to 16 pounds</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Coat and Color: Abundant, straight and slightly harsh to the touch. Shorter on the face and fronts of the legs, medium length on the body, and longer around the neck and backs of the legs. Solid black coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><p>With its keen sense of smell, the Belgian Malinois is also smart, athletic, and hard-working, making them the perfect K-9 canine.</p><p>Belgian Malinois can be picky, so ask your vet to make sure your fill this breed's dietary requirements. They need a good amount of protein and fat, vitamins and minerals, and possibly some fruits and veggies.</p><p>Very much like a German Shepherd!</p>",1022

For these pups, the answer is a clear and resounding ""yes"".</p><p>Long ears on dogs are thought to help funnel scents directly from the surrounding environment to their sensitive noses, which helps explain why they're a common feature on scent hounds and other tracking breeds.</p><p>These days, you probably don't need your dog to be able to use their ears to track your next meal, but those long ears are as cute as they are useful, and remain a distinctive trait on many popular dog breeds. If you're interested in what those breeds are, here are nine of the most commonly known dogs with long ears.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Long ears require special care. Aim to clean them at least once a week using a veterinarian-approved ear cleansing solution and a cotton ball.</p><h2>Bloodhound</h2><p>The most famous long-eared dog might just be the Bloodhound. This large and affectionate breed has been helping humans hunt scents since Medieval times.</p><p>Bloodhounds are prone to ear infections, so regular cleanings are a must to keep dirt, debris, and bacteria out of the folds and canal of their delicate and impressive ears.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (males); 23 to 25 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 90 to 110 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Short, dense, and loose coat, with many folds around the face, neck, and ears</p><h2>Afghan Hound</h2><p>The origins of this ancient breed are hard to nail down since they're thought to have been around since long before people started writing about them. What we do know is that they can be traced back to several regions in Afghanistan and that their long and flowing ears are as distinguishable a part of the breed as their luxurious coat.</p><p>These long-haired coats need a lot of maintenance, so Afghans are best suited to homes that can dedicate the time to this task.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: About 50 to 60 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Coat is long, thick, and fine and can be any color or combination of colors, including brindle and domino</p><h2>American Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>Long ears are a pretty dominant trait in Spaniels, including the American Cocker Spaniel, the Field Spaniel, and the Welsh Springer Spaniel.</p><p>The American Cocker Spaniel's happy disposition and kid-friendly personality are two things that make them popular family pets (along with those curly-haired ears, of course).</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 20 to 30 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Silky and flat or slightly wavy coat that's well-feathered on the ears, chest, belly, and legs</p><h2>Basset Hound</h2><p>This list wouldn't be complete without the lovable Basset Hound, a charming breed that's as famous for their agreeable nature as they are for their outstanding ears.</p><p>Their scent tracking abilities are second only to the Bloodhound, and those long and droopy ears certainly help explain why. Just be prepared for some stubbornness, as this is a typical characteristic of the breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 15 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Short coat that can be found in combinations of black/mahogany, white, brown/tan, red, and lemon</p><h2>Beagle</h2><p>Beagles are among the most popular dog breeds in the world, and have been for some time. That's due in large part to their reputation as excellent family pets, with carefree attitudes and a knack for easily adapting to their environments. We think those adorable long, floppy ears might have something to do with it too.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: Up to 15 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 20 to 25 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Short coats in all hound colors, including but not limited to tri-color (tan, black, and white), red and white, and lemon and white</p><h2>Treeing Walker Coonhound</h2><p>Long ears are a common trait among Coonhound breeds, as evidenced by the Treeing Walker Coonhound. This intelligent American working breed uses both their striking ears and their distinctive bark to help humans out hunting.</p><p>As with many scenthounds, you might have to put a little extra work in when it comes to the recall training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 27 inches (males); 20 to 25 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Smooth, short, and fine coat typically found in white, black, or tan tri-color</p><h2>Havanese</h2><p>One of the smaller breeds on this list, Havanese are clever pups with long ears that are proportionate to their bodies and a silky coat that necessities regular grooming.</p><p>These dogs are often chosen by owners prone to allergies. While there is no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog, Havanese shed hair minimally.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8.5 to 11.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 7 to 13 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Coat can vary drastically from silky straight to very wavy with ringlets, and may also present in a variety of colors</p><h2>Lhasa Apso</h2><p>Another small breed, the Lhasa Apso originated in Tibet more than 2,500 years ago and has a dense, durable coat coupled with (you guessed it) some seriously long ears.</p><p>Their ear fur runs longer than their ears itself, so check it regularly for tangles and debris. This is another breed that has a high-maintenance grooming regime, but, on the plus side, they don't shed much.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 11 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 12 to 18 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Dense double coat in nearly any color, most commonly black, white, gold, gray, cream, or a combination of these</p><h2>Weimaraner</h2><p>Rounding out this list is the Weimaraner, a graceful and affectionate sporting breed with captivating eyes and ears that are useful when they're on the hunt.</p><p>Those velvety, oversized ears are thought to be the product of some interbreeding with Bloodhounds back in the day, but these days they've made the trait all their own - and their length is a little more manageable.</p><p>Weimaraners are athletic and energetic and will need a home that can offer them enough exercise and stimulation to prevent problem behaviors from developing.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (males); 23 to 25 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 70 to 90 pounds (males); 55 to 75 pounds (females)</p><p>Physical characteristics: Short and stiff coat in various shades of gray</p>",968

88,https://www.thesprucepets.com/black-dog-syndrome-4796374,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>What Is Black Dog Syndrome?</h1>,"<h1>What Is Black Dog Syndrome?</h1><p>Black dog syndrome, also known as BDS, is a phenomenon in pet adoption in which black dogs are ignored in favor of light-colored ones. Observed by shelters and rescue groups across the world, BDS is an issue negatively affecting the adoption rates of black pets. The reason behind the phenomenon is unclear.</p><p>Adopters might pass by black dogs because of a fear stigma against certain breed types like pit bulls, for instance. Movies and television shows often portray big, black dogs as aggressive and intimidating, which could also convince potential adopters to avoid them. Some believe it could come down to how photogenic dogs are. Notoriously, black dogs do not photograph well. Lighter-colored dogs, on the other hand, do. When shelters or rescues photograph their adoptable animals to post on their website or on social media, lighter-colored dogs may have the upper hand.</p><h2>Origins and History</h2><p>The BDS phenomenon has been studied for decades, gaining media attention since the 2000s when activists began publicly addressing the issue. Historically speaking, black dog syndrome can be traced back ages.</p><p>In mythology and folklore, black dogs are regularly portrayed as guardians of the underworld. They're also represented as bad omens in general. Those stories date back hundreds of years and they may creep into adopters' minds when they are perusing the shelter. And some people believe black dog syndrome may be due to potential adopters associating the color black with evil.</p><p>Other theories as to why BDS exists include the fact that black or dark coats are less noticeable and that black dogs simply don't photograph well and, as a result, they don't always attract adopters. In addition to a fear stigma against certain breeds that are often portrayed as aggressive, geographic location may also play into BDS.</p><p>Black cats are in a similar situation and are often subject to the same phenomenon, also known as black cat syndrome. Some believe black cats are in a tougher position due to the added stigma of superstition and their association with witchcraft, which could deter potential owners.</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>Shelter workers across the globe say they have witnessed black dog syndrome in action first-hand. Due to the phenomenon, larger, black dog breeds tend to stay at the shelter significantly longer than smaller, lighter-colored dogs. Many black dogs even get euthanized as a result.</p><p>While some believe it's genuinely tougher for black dogs to find their forever families, science has not proven or disproven the theory. There are several studies that contradict each other.</p><p>In a 2011 study by the ASPCA, appearance was the most frequently cited reason for those adopting a canine. A study published in the in 2002 found that black coat colors negatively influenced adoption rates for both dogs and cats. Researchers said adoption rates were much lower in pure-black animals.</p><p>Other scientific studies seem to contradict these results, like one looking at how long dogs remained in two New York shelters in 2013. That study determined that coat color had no effect on their length of stay, and noted that black dog syndrome may only take effect in certain areas of the world, possibly due to cultural differences.</p><p>While it's difficult to determine whether or not BDS is a reality in shelters, animal-lovers can agree that it's an unwelcome phenomenon.</p><h2>How to Help</h2><p>Black dogs are no different than dogs of other colors. They act the same, provide the same amount of love, and give just as many kisses. If you want to help reduce the impacts of black dog syndrome, adopting one is the perfect solution. </p><p>Adopting a black dog is a surefire way for you to help black dogs find forever homes. Head to your local shelter or hop onto a site like PetFinder to find your new furry friend. You can also look at rescue associations, who often take in black dogs, and even rescues specific to black dogs. Rescuing a black dog from a shelter or rescue will make room for more animals who are ready to be saved. Bonus? You will have a brand new pup to call your own.</p><p>If you're in no place to get a dog of your own, consider donating to local shelters or rescues to help support their operations and perhaps give a black dog more hope. You can also volunteer your time to support local shelters. Often, shelters will have volunteer opportunities to walk, play with, or even just relax with dogs. Volunteering is a great way to positively influence a dog's life without spending the big bucks or making a life-changing commitment.You can also make a difference in a black shelter animal's life by sharing your thoughts on the issue with friends, family, and community members. Encourage them to adopt a black dog or cat and be sure to share photos of adoptable pets on your website or social media channels to give them a boost. Word-of-mouth makes a surprisingly big impact.</p>",808

But it might surprise you to learn that there is actually no such thing as a ""pit bull."" In fact, a pit bull isn't a specific breed-there are several types of pit bulls. Pit bull is an umbrella term that's used for several breeds often referred to as ""bully breeds."" This is no reflection on their temperaments, however. Bully breeds are generally playful and affectionate dogs when raised properly.</p><p>Pit bull-type dogs often face unfair discrimination. These dogs were bred for their muscular build and consequently have been used in inhumane dogfighting sports. This has given them an inaccurate reputation as being overly aggressive dogs. In fact, pit bull-type dogs are usually incredibly loving, loyal, and gentle with their family members. They also tend to be playful and eager to please.</p><h3>Breed Characteristics</h3><p>Pit bull-type dogs typically have muscular, stocky builds with deep chests and large, square heads. They're notoriously determined dogs. When given a task, whether it be learning a new trick or digging a hole, they won't give up easily. And they usually love people, including strangers, and crave attention. Training and socialization from a young age are important for pit bulls. Otherwise, their size and strength can be difficult to handle, as they might pull hard on a leash or jump up on people to greet them.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Due to the stigma surrounding these breeds, certain areas have banned ownership of pit bull-type dogs. Make sure to check your local legislation before bringing one of these dogs home.</p><h2>American Bully</h2><p>The American bully is a relatively new breed that was first developed in the '80s and '90s. Recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2013 but not yet by the American Kennel Club, the breed came from the American pit bull terrier and other bulldog-type breeds. In comparison to the American pit bull terrier, bullies are much broader, more compact, and have a wider head. Bullies from responsible breeders have been specifically developed for their gentle and affectionate temperament. But bullies are still strong and athletic, so they need plenty of exercises to keep them happy and healthy, as well as regular socialization time with people and other dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 13 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 85 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Compact, strong, thickset, and muscular; short and smooth coat; comes in a wide variety of coat colors and patterns</p><h2>American Pit Bull Terrier</h2><p>The American pit bull terrier is another breed recognized by the United Kennel Club but not the American Kennel Club. Its ancestors were 19th-century terriers and bulldogs that came from the United Kingdom, and the breed took shape in North America in the late 19th century. Sadly this breed has been commonly used for dog fighting. Although modern American pit bull terriers can have a high prey drive and don't always get along with other dogs, they're known for forming strong bonds with their families. And as with most pit bull types, they tend to be loyal and affectionate. Be sure you have enough time to devote to play, socializing, and exercise if you are considering adopting an American pit bull terrier.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 65 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular build; short coat; colors include black, white, brindle, fawn, blue, red, brown, tan, and gray</p><h2>American Staffordshire Terrier</h2><p>The American Staffordshire terrier also has roots in the terriers and bulldogs of 19th century England. Its development in late 19th century North America resulted in a dog that was larger than its English relatives. The breed wasn't used as commonly for fighting as some of the other pit bull types, which resulted in more mellow dogs. But Am Staffs still can have a high prey drive and don't always get along with other dogs. However, they're known for being loyal, playful, and good-natured with their families. They do well in households that have plenty of time for canine interaction, play, and exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 17 to 19 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short coat; a variety of colors including black, brown, blue, fawn, red, and liver; brindle pattern and/or white markings are also seen</p><h2>Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h2><p>Despite the Staffordshire bull terrier's development in the 19th century for dog fighting, the breed today is more closely associated with being unfailingly loyal and affectionate with its family. These dogs often love nothing more than snuggling with their owners, and they tend to be patient and gentle with children. They are a breed that is best suited to a household where they will have company for most of the day, as they can be prone to separation anxiety. Moreover, they tend to be people-focused and don't always get along well with other dogs. Still, they make a fine pet for an active household that has time to devote to their need for attention and exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 14 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 24 to 38 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Muscular build; colors include black, blue, brindle, fawn, white, and more</p><h2>American Bulldog</h2><p>The American bulldog is a descendant of English bulldogs, which were developed in the 17th century for bull baiting-a blood sport that involved dogs fighting bulls. In North America, bulldogs became working dogs on farms and all-around friendly companions. They tend to be extremely affectionate with their families, often wanting to sit in laps despite their large size. They also often love kids. But they can be very protective of their families, so training and socialization starting in puppyhood are a must to ensure they will be friendly to people outside of your household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 20 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 120 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Stocky build; deep chest; short muzzle; typically white with patches of brindle, red, black, or shades of brown or gray</p><p>There is no specific breed called a pit bull; pit bulls are either American bullys, American pit bull terriers, American Staffordshire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, American bulldogs, or a mix of these breeds.</p><p>Originally, these breeds were created by mixing terriers and bulldogs, but they are now recognized as distinct breeds.</p><p>It depends on whether you're seeking a pedigreed dog or not. Recognized breeds can cost from $1000 to $3000 for a show-quality puppy. But mixed-breed pit bulls are available at nearly every shelter or foster organization in this country, for the mere price of an adoption fee.</p><p>Pit bulls are medium to large-sized dogs, ranging in size from 30 to 90 pounds. Because they have very solid, muscular builds, and large broad heads, they can appear to be larger than they actually are.</p><p>Pit bulls have an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. You can keep your bully-breed pet healthy and happy well into its golden years by feeding it a well-balanced diet, providing plenty of opportunities for play and exercise, visiting the vet regularly for checkups and healthcare, and spending time every day interacting and enjoying your pet.</p><p>Although bully-breed dogs are short-haired, they do shed. However, because their fur is relatively coarse and very short, shed hairs tend to not be as noticeable as shed hair from longer-haired breeds.</p><p>You can minimize shedding by brushing your pit bull once or twice a week with a dog brush designed for short-hair breeds. Bathing your bully with a gentle shampoo formulated specifically for dogs will further reduce annoying shed hair on your furniture, clothes, and carpet.</p>",1231

Herding dogs come in all shapes and sizes from all over the world. They are adept at herding in mountainous areas, flat fields, and all-weather situations.</p><p>Herding dogs have slightly different flock management styles, such as the border collie, which stays at the front of the herd, curbing wanderers by using its stare to keep the herd together in a group. Heelers like Australian cattle dogs or corgis are driving dogs that keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. Other types like the Australian shepherd and Old English sheepdog do a little bit of both. Belgian herding dogs, German shepherds, and Briards are tending dogs that guide large flocks of sheep to graze and prevent wandering.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Herding breeds are among the most intelligent and active dog breeds. They tend to be highly trainable but need ample mental and physical exercise. Most of the herding dogs from cold-weather regions are long-haired or double-coated to protect them in the mountains or during harsh weather conditions. Unfortunately, most herding dogs are so ingrained with herding instincts that it may include nudging or heel-nipping of their human companions, too.</p><p>Here are 17 of the best-known dog breeds for herding sheep, cattle, and other livestock.</p><h2>Australian Cattle Dog</h2><p>marion802105 / Pixabay</p><p>Australian cattle dogs were developed to herd in extreme weather conditions from intensely scorching temps to a rainy Australian Outback.

Because they are so intelligent and eager to please, they tend to be easy to train. These athletic, energetic dogs excel in dog sports, including agility and flying disc, which are helpful to drain them of some energy. These dogs look similar to their cousin, the rough collie, although they are much smaller. They are similar in character and are highly intelligent, friendly, and affectionate animals. They are also highly protective of their family, making them excellent watchdogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 13 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 25 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Straight and harsh with a dense undercoat; black, sable, and blue merle, with white markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p>",1138

It's often suggested that it was the ancient Egyptians that domesticated dogs. A tomb dating back to 3500 BC shows a painting of a man walking a dog on a leash. These dogs closely resemble the ancient civilization's hieroglyphs and tomb drawings of Egypt's iconic dogs.</p><p>Some of these ancient dogs have developed into the native Egyptian dog breeds that we know today. Other neighboring Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, and African countries have made these original breeds their own.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>The dogs originating from Egypt come primarily from a hot, dry desert or North African Mediterranean climate. Their bodies match well with those climates-not well suited for Arctic climes or humid tropics. These intelligent, high-energy dogs were also bred for an active, working lifestyle as hunters, shepherds, or guard dogs. Today, these breeds follow in the pawprints of their ancient ancestors, requiring plenty of exercise, mental stimulation, and a sense of purpose.</p><p>When choosing a dog to come to be part of your family, where you live, and the climate can impact a dog's happiness. Big dogs with thick double coats have some difficulty acclimating to hot or tropical climates, while dogs with short, fine hair find harsh or snowy winters too much for their not-so-insulated bodies.</p><p>Here are 6 breeds to consider if you're interested in having one of the world's ancient breeds.</p><h2>Saluki</h2><p>The elegant and athletic saluki means ""noble"" in Arabic and is one of the oldest dog breeds. Their history goes back at least 5,000 years. Ancient Egyptian tombstones and sculptures feature dogs resembling the modern-day saluki. The pharaohs prized these dogs for their regal looks and athletic hunting prowess-as did other prominent leaders through history, like Alexander the Great. The breed spread across the Middle East, Egypt, and Asia over the years, brought by nomadic tribes.</p><p>Like many sighthounds, the saluki is incredibly fast and usually has a high prey drive-not suited to home life with other small furry pets. If they get plenty of exercise, salukis are known for being docile and enjoy curling up in the home. They have an independent, stubborn streak, are sensitive, and require gentle, positive reinforcement for training results.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Feathered or smooth coat; softly feathered ears; white or cream, fawn, black and tan or grizzle and tan, and golden coat colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>Basenji</h2><p>The basenji, or in African languages its name translates to mean ""dog of the bush, village, or wild,"" is another old breed. It also bears a striking resemblance to dogs depicted on Egyptian pharoah tombstones. Over the years, tribes in Central Africa valued the breed's excellent hunting skills. The breed has remained relatively untouched by selective breeding. The basenji you see today closely resembles its ancestors from thousands of years ago.</p><p>Basenjis are loyal, gentle and alert, but can be stubborn and require extra patience during training. They tend to be reserved and even aloof with new people but form strong bonds with their families. Don't expect a lapdog with a basenji, though. They will seek attention on their terms, compared often to cats. This breed is an attractive choice for people who live in apartments since it doesn't bark.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 16 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 25 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Smooth, short coat in chestnut red, black, brindle, or tricolor (black and red); all have white feet, chest and tail tip; may have white legs, blaze, and collar</p><p>Life Expectancy: 13 to 14 years</p><h2>Ibizan Hound</h2><p>Strictly speaking, the Ibizan hound is considered native to the Balearic Islands, off Spain's coast. These elegant sighthounds are another breed that can easily trace their original lineage back to Egypt that made their way to Spain by ancient Phoenician sea traders. Looks alone tell the story of this breed that appears strikingly like dogs seen on various tombstones and historical artifacts in Egypt.</p><p>Food could be scarce on the Mediterranean islands, and these agile, leaping, high-speed dogs were determined hunters that navigated the rugged terrain to bring back rabbits for their people. High-energy, strong prey drive, great-stamina dogs, Ibizan hounds are best suited to living in active homes with no small animals.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coarse hair that can be smooth or wiry; comes in solid red, solid white, or white and red patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Pharaoh Hound</h2><p>Like the Ibizan hound, the pharaoh hound is another ancient breed that can trace its origins back to the land of the Nile; its name is a nod to its ancient Egyptian heritage. It made its way to Europe from Phoenician traders and developed further on the Mediterranean island of Malta.</p><p>The breed shares similar traits with the Ibizan hound in terms of looks and temperament. It was also primarily used for hunting rabbits; in Maltese, this energetic breed is called ""kelb tal-fenek,"" meaning ""rabbit dog."" They're less reserved than the Ibizan hound with a friendly, playful nature, making them good companions for respectful children.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 25 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth glossy coat that only comes in shades of tan; noble and athletic in appearance with large, pricked ears</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Baladi Street Dog</h2><p>While Baladi dogs are not a pure breed, this dog is the most common in Egypt. It descended from a mixture of salukis, pharaoh hounds, and Israeli Canaan dogs. These native stray dogs are prolific on the streets and across the rural countryside of the country. They share similar characteristics with some of their purebred relatives, including large pricked ears and a slim physique.</p><p>Over the years, these dogs have grown in numbers, becoming a nuisance. Many locals grew to revile and even abuse them, although an international outcry shined a light on this issue. Several successful spay and neuter campaigns have helped curbed overpopulation, and Baladi dogs are being rescued overseas and within Egypt through local adoption programs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not a recognized group; mixed breed</p><p>Height: No particular size, described as ""medium-sized""</p><p>Weight: Medium-sized generally means between 20 and 60 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Brown, beige, black, and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Armant (Egyptian Sheepdog)</h2><p>The Armant is a farm and herding breed that may have originally descended from the French Briard herding dog. It is thought to have been brought to Egypt by Napoleon's armies. This breed was developed by mixing with local dogs. The dog's name originates from the town of Armant in Egypt, its supposed place of origin in the early 1900s. The breed is not known much outside of Egypt but is used extensively within Egypt as a herding dog and a livestock guard dog.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not in a recognized group</p><p>Height: 21 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, coarse, rough, shaggy coat; comes in black, tan, gray, and yellow</p><p>Life Expectancy: 14 to 15 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>Egyptian breeds proliferated over time and more than 1,000 miles for their energetic drive and skill as hunters, herders, and protection. If you value these breeds' high-energy, intelligence, and determination to get a job done, then some dogs that might disappoint are dogs known for their lounging, lapdog tendencies. These lower-energy dogs also look nothing like Egyptian breeds: mastiffs, Cavalier King Charles spaniels, and Chihuahuas.</p>",1230

They are also known as ""American dingoes"" or ""Dixie dingoes"" because they resemble the famous Australian dingo. But rather than being from the land down under, this breed is actually descended from wild dogs found in the United States, but with a gentle nature that makes it an ideal family pet.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound (per AKC)</p><p>HEIGHT: 18 to 20 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 30 to 55 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, dense</p><p>COAT COLOR: Tan, yellow, black, red, or a combination of these colors </p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12-15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, adaptable, gentle, reserved, adventurous, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Carolina Dog</h2><p>The Carolina dog may just be the epitome of a man's best friend: loyal, playful, protective, and always up for an adventure. A relatively new breed to domestication, Carolina dogs are known for being extremely devoted companions to the humans they bond with. They have a strong pack mentality, so being close to their family unit is a must for these athletic, energetic pets.</p><h2>History of the Carolina Dog</h2><p>The Carolina dog is thought to have come to the U.S. by means of passage through the Bering Strait when merchants came from Asia to North America. Through the years, individual dogs escaped, becoming feral and gradually migrating towards the southeastern U.S. Today, the breed has become known as the Carolina dog.</p><p>Descendants of these dogs that started life in the far north reaches of the North American continent can still be found living wild in Georgia and South Carolina, typically among pine forests or near swamps.</p><p>Their DNA contains traits from the very base of the canine family tree, meaning the Carolina dog is a very primitive breed and may resemble the type and appearance of some of the earliest canines. Remains of Carolina dogs have even been found in ancient Native American burial sites, suggesting that these dogs were kept as pets during these long-ago times.</p><p>The breed was rediscovered in the 1970s by Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin, who gave them the name ""Carolina dog."" Since 1996 they have been a registered breed by the UKC, or United Kennel Club. They are not officially recognized by the AKC as of yet. However, in 2017 they were listed in the AKC's Foundation Stock Service, which is an indicator that the breed is working towards official recognition.</p><h2>Carolina Dog Care</h2><p>If you are looking into adopting a Carolina dog, give serious thought as to how much time you will be with your pup. An isolated Carolina dog is a sad one. Dogs that are left alone for long periods may struggle with boredom or stress, which often manifests itself in destructive or disruptive behaviors and separation anxiety.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite their athletic appearance, this breed is not known for having excessively high energy. However, they most definitely require regular exercise and are best suited for a home with a yard to play in and room to run. Daily walks are a must to keep your Carolina dog healthy and happy. Set aside about an hour a day to exercise your Carolina pup.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>These dogs are known for being clean and actually wash as much cats do. The Carolina dog, however, sheds a lot, particularly during seasonal changes. In colder months, these dogs will grow in a thicker, warmer coat. When warmer weather rolls around, they'll shed this. As a result, this breed is typically not a great choice for allergy-sensitive people. Because of shedding and coat changes, be sure to regularly bathe and brush this breed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Carolina dogs are also very intelligent, and may sometimes have a stubborn streak. However, they also have a willingness to please, meaning they respond well to training with positive reinforcement. Because of their agile frame and high intelligence, Carolina dogs often excel at competitive agility sports and hunting.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Carolina dogs are quite healthy and are not prone to having any particular diseases or health problems. It has been found that some are sensitive to ivermectin (used for treating mites and intestinal parasites), however, so talk with your veterinarian before giving them this type of medication.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Carolina dog's diet should closely resemble what they would eat in the wild. Giving them high-quality or homemade food would be best. If overfed, these dogs can struggle with obesity. Therefore, be sure not to overfeed them or give them too many treats.</p><p>Ask your veterinarian for specific food requirements for your dog and its lifestyle. Each may be different depending on weight, size, and age.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Carolina Dog</h2><p>Though the Carolina dog makes a wonderful companion, it is not a dog for everyone. Be sure you can give them the time, attention, and exercise they need. Remember that these dogs need to be with their packs which means you most of the time. Be sure to talk with breeders or others who have Carolina dogs to get a feel for what it is really like to live with one.</p><p>The good news is that this breed may be more common in your area than you realize. If you are searching for a Carolina dog, be sure to always check your local adoption and rescue agencies. Some may not even realize that they have Carolina dogs since many are mistaken for mutts or unknown mixes. If you are searching for accurately identified Carolina dogs or strong Carolina dog mixes, be sure to check out the clubs, breeders, and rescues listed below.</p><p>The Saving Carolina Dogs Rescue and Adoption Network lists all Carolina dogs they are working with that need rescuing from shelters. Pups have loving foster families and are available in different areas across the U.S. If there are no Carolina dogs listed near you, be sure to contact and research your local rescues. If you choose to find a dog through a breeder, expect to pay between $800 to $2,000 for a Carolina puppy.</p><p>Loyal attachment to adults and children alike</p><p>Clean and almost cat-like in grooming habits</p><p>Excellent watchdog, but without aggressive tendencies</p><p>Does not do well in isolation or when separated from pack</p><p>Strong prey drive, challenging for households with smaller animals</p><p>Heavy shedders</p><h2>Carolina Dog Overview</h2>",1024

This athletic breed is known for the ridge of hair along its back that grows in the opposite direction from the other hair. Thai Ridgebacks are deeply loyal, fierce, protective, and hard-working dogs that are rarely seen outside of Thailand.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 20 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: Males: 50 to 60 pounds; Females: 35 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short and smooth</p><p>Coat Colors: Black, blue, fawn, or red</p><p>Life Span: 12-15 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, loyal, independent, bold, protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Thailand<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Thai Ridgeback</h2><p>While they may boast a somewhat intimidating appearance, Thai Ridgebacks are among the most loyal and underrepresented dog breeds. Their playful and energetic nature makes them perfectly suited to an active household, and they respond well to firm but kind training.</p><h2>History of the Thai Ridgeback</h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is considered a ""pariah-type"" dog, a term used to describe partially wild, free-range dogs that live on the outskirts of human civilization and reproduce almost entirely by natural selection. Pariah dogs like the Thai Ridgeback have remained much the same over time because there were few opportunities for them to breed with different types of dogs.</p><p>The pariah dog ancestors of Thai Ridgebacks can be traced back to ancient Thailand and likely originated around the time dogs first began to evolve from wolves. It is unclear when the Thai Ridgeback actually evolved from Asian pariah dogs, but evidence of the breed can be found in Thai writings from the 17th century. Thai Ridgebacks can be found primarily in Eastern Thailand and the islands of Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. It is believed that Thai fishermen once brought the breed to neighboring islands.</p><p>Thai Ridgebacks were historically used as watchdogs, hunting dogs, and to escort carts. They were even used to kill cobras in some areas. The Dog Association of Thailand was founded in 1976 and recognized the indigenous Thai Ridgeback as an official breed. Thai Ridgebacks were first brought to the United States in 1994 by rare dog breed enthusiast Jack Sterling. The breed has been a member of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service since 1997 and has been designated part of the Hound group.</p><h2>Thai Ridgeback Care</h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is a low-maintenance breed that will be happy in your home does best in moderate to warm climates and is not well-suited for cold temperatures. This breed should live indoors and have access to a yard with a fence if possible.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Thai Ridgebacks are athletic dogs that need daily exercise to keep them in shape and provide an outlet for energy and prevent boredom. Active dogs may benefit from involvement in various dog sports, and puzzles or games are a great indoor option for cold weather climates.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Thai Ridgeback needs minimal grooming. Occasional brushing is typically all that is needed to keep the coat shiny and remove dead hairs. This breed has no undercoat and tends to shed very little. However, shedding will increase seasonally and can be reduced by brushing their coat and bathing as needed. As with any dog, their nails should be trimmed regularly and their ears should be checked and cleaned periodically.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training and socialization are essential for the independent and sometimes stubborn Thai Ridgeback. Begin a training routine with your dog or puppy as soon as possible, whether doing it on your own or getting help from a dog trainer. Be consistent and firm yet gentle, using positive reinforcement methods over aversives. Thai Ridgebacks are independent and bold, so they respond best to people with natural leadership qualities.</p><p>Be sure to socialize your Thai Ridgeback at an early age, exposing them to as many people and animals as possible. This breed has a high prey drive and is likely to chase small animals like cats. Some Thai Ridgebacks can be aggressive with other dogs if not properly socialized. In addition, these dogs should be exposed to children at a young age and taught how to behave properly so they will be kid-friendly as adults.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is generally a healthy dog breed. Responsible dog breeders take care to breed to ensure health problems are not passed on to puppies. There are few conditions known to affect Thai Ridgebacks.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Proper nutrition is important for all dogs, and the Thai Ridgeback is no exception. Choose a high-quality dog food rich in animal proteins. A combination of wet and dry food can help entice your dog to eat well and will also help maintain hydration. Puppies should be fed food labeled for growth until about one year of age.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Thai Ridgeback</h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is a rare dog breed outside of Southeast Asia, so it may be difficult to find an established breeder or rescue group in your area. Contact local dog breeders, veterinarians, and pet professionals to find out if Thai Ridgebacks are available in your region. Visit nationally recognized breed groups to find out more about opportunities to get your own Thai Ridgeback.</p><h2>Thai Ridgeback Overview</h2><p>Fiercely loyal to family</p><p>Needs little grooming</p><p>Athletic and hard-working</p><p>High prey drive may pose a risk around cats and other smaller animals</p><p>Rare and may be difficult to find purebred puppies</p><p>Can be stubborn</p>",872

Hypoallergenic dog breeds are also ideal for people who suffer from dog allergies. If you're interested in a small hypoallergenic dog, it's important to understand what to expect (and not expect) from a hypoallergenic breed.</p><h2>What does hypoallergenic mean?</h2><p>People who are allergic to dogs usually react to proteins found in a dog's saliva, fur, or dander, which is dried bits of skin. Different dogs create different amounts of dander. This varies according to the size of the dog (smaller dogs will have less dander) and the breed. And individual dogs of any breed might naturally have more or less dander.</p><p>Many people think the term hypoallergenic refers to a dog that will not trigger an allergic reaction, but that is not accurate. Hypo&rdquo; means less, or below average and a hypoallergenic dog is one that sheds less and so is less likely to cause an allergic reaction in someone sensitive to dog fur and dander.</p><p>Most hypoallergenic breeds are non-shedding or low-shedding. Allergic people may react to the hair itself, as well as the dander contained in the hair follicles. When the dog sheds hair, the dander goes with it, and is spread throughout the house. Less hair leaving the dog means less dander in the home. Hypoallergenic dog breeds usually require regular professional grooming and consistent brushing to keep the coat tangle-free.</p><p>It's important to note that no dog breed or individual dog is guaranteed not to cause a reaction in an allergic person. People with severe dog allergies may not be able to tolerate any dog, even a hypoallergenic one. If you are considering getting a breed in the hopes you will not be allergic to it, spend time indoors with adult dogs of the breed to see if you react before committing to a puppy.</p><h2>Affenpinscher</h2><p>The Affenpinscher is small but bold, something that's not surprising once you know the breed's original purpose was hunting and killing rats and other pesky rodents. If you aren't completely won over by the Affenpincher's adorable monkey face,&rdquo; you'll be entertained by its comical personality. The low-shedding wiry coat needs twice-weekly brushing and trimming every two or three months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 9 to 11.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 7 to 10 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short face; wiry and shaggy coat; comes in black, gray, silver, red, black and tan, or beige</p><h2>Bedlington Terrier</h2><p>Bedlington Terriers look-and feel-just like sweet little lambs. Don't let the Bedlington's appearance fool you into thinking they are timid or pampered creatures. They were originally used to dispatch rats and other troublesome vermin on farms and deep in in coal mines, and have retained their tenacity and prey drive. At home they are gentle and loving companions. The oh-so-soft coat does not shed much, but Bedlingtons need professional grooming every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 15.5 to 17.5 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 17 to 23 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Graceful, lithe and well-balanced. The crisp coat, which is a mixture of hard and soft hair, comes in blue, sandy, or liver, sometimes combined with tan.</p><h2>Bichon Frise</h2><p>Outgoing and playful, the adorable Bichon Frise looks and feels like a soft, fluffy cloud. In France, they were first bred as companions where the small white dogs enjoyed an easy life as pets to the wealthy, but later found a new profession as delightful circus dogs. Gentle, affectionate, and friendly, Bichons love people of all ages. The fluffy white coat does not shed but needs regular professional grooming.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 9 to 12 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small yet sturdy with a fluffy curly coat that is always white (the coat may have traces of apricot, buff, or cream)</p><h2>Coton de Tulear</h2><p>The Coton de Tulear's dense, cottony coat is long and luxurious. The so-called Royal Dog of Madagascar is the ultimate companion dog, wanting nothing more than to devote its life to you all day, every day. In addition to professional grooming, the low-shedding coat needs daily brushing with a coat conditioning spray to keep it tangle free and protect from breakage. Or if you prefer, keep your Coton in a shorter pet clip, which requires less maintenance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 11 inches tall at the shoulder (males); 9 to 10 inches (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 9 to 15 pounds (males); 8 to 13 pounds (females)</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small, yet sturdy. The long coat is always pure white (a few slight shadings of light grey or light tan are permitted on the ears).</p><h2>Havanese</h2><p>The Havanese stands out in a crowd thanks to its beautiful, long silky coat. The breed originated in Havana, Cuba, more than 300 years ago, where they were cherished lapdogs of the wealthy. Smart, energetic, and outgoing, the Havanese loves to play, explore, and meet new friends. The breed gets along well with people of all ages, including gentle children. The low-shedding coat needs daily brushing to prevent mats. It can also be kept in an easier short style.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 8.5 to 11.5 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 7 to 13 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small, sturdy and slightly longer than tall; the coat can vary drastically from silky straight to very wavy with ringlets; the breed may have one or two colors including, but not limited to, black, silver, white, cream, tan, fawn, gold, sable, and red.</p><h2>L&ouml;wchen</h2><p>The L&ouml;wchen's thick, soft coat is often kept in a lion trim with shaved hindquarters and a longer mane on the neck and head, giving way to the breed's nickname of Little Lion Dog. Likely originated in Germany or the Mediterranean, L&ouml;wchen have been around for centuries. In Pre-Renaissance Europe, L&ouml;wchen were popular companion dogs of ladies of the royal courts. L&ouml;wchen are excellent family dogs, happily playing with respectful children and enjoying all aspects of family life. The coat sheds a little, but not much, especially if you brush it regularly.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 12 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 10 to 18 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small, compact and balanced. The long, thick, soft, slightly wavy coat comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns, and is often cut into a distinctive lion clip.</p><h2>Maltese</h2><p>The silky-coated Maltese is one of the oldest breeds of dog, with Mediterranean roots going back more than 2,000 years on the island nation of Malta. Extremely affectionate and people-oriented, Maltese are perfect for those who want a cuddly lap dog. Lively and playful, they are small enough to easily accompany you everywhere-something they would much rather do than stay at home alone. The snow-white, long, silky coat doesn't shed, but it needs professional grooming and daily brushing with a pin brush or comb to prevent tangles and breakage. Some Maltese owners prefer a low-maintenance puppy cut.&rdquo;</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 8 to 10 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 4 to 7 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small and compact. The long, silky single-layer coat is pure white.</p><h2>Miniature Schnauzer</h2><p>The Miniature Schnauzer is the smallest of three related Schnauzer breeds, including the Standard Schnauzer and Giant Schnauzer. All share similar backgrounds as farm dogs and rat hunters, and all have wiry, low-shedding coats trimmed to leave a shaggy beard, mustache, and eyebrows. Though small in size, Miniature Schnauzers have plenty of energy and spirit. They love to play and need moderate daily exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 12 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 11 to 19 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdily built, nearly square in proportion, with plenty of bone. The wiry double coat may be salt and pepper, black and silver, or solid black.</p>",1254
74,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-do-goldendoodles-cost-5225356,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hybrid Dog Breeds,<h1>How Much Are Goldendoodles?</h1>,"<h1>How Much Are Goldendoodles?</h1><p>If you are hoping to add a goldendoodle puppy to your family, you might be wondering how much it might cost to purchase a goldendoodle. The answer to the question ""How much are goldendoodles?"" varies depending on where you obtain your goldendoodle, whether you want to acquire a puppy or adult goldendoodle, what color or size of goldendoodle you have your heart set on, and many other factors. </p><p>Goldendoodles can cost anywhere from about $200 dollars to more than $5,000, depending on whether you adopt an adult goldendoodle or buy a puppy (or adult) from a breeder.</p><p>Before buying or adopting any dog, it pays to do your homework. Knowing where to search for your next dog, what to look for in a reputable breeder, and what you should expect to pay can improve your odds of bringing home a healthy dog at a reasonable cost.</p><p>Purebred dogs have national breed clubs that provide information about the breed. Though the goldendoodle is a crossbreed, a national organization called the Goldendoodle Association of North America supports responsible breeding and pet ownership. GANA member breeders agree to abide by the association's code of ethics, which are designed to ensure that breeders are producing healthy dogs in a responsible manner, marketing puppies conscientiously, and educating potential puppy owners on the proper care of goldendoodles. </p><h2>Cost of Adopting a Goldendoodle</h2><p>Goldendoodles occasionally find themselves in need of rescue when people buy puppies from unscrupulous breeders who make unrealistic guarantees, or when new pup parents find themselves unprepared for caring for their goldendoodle. For instance, reputable goldendoodle breeders should never guarantee that a puppy will be 'hypoallergenic' or will not shed. The nature of genetics means that it's impossible to predict such qualities in a puppy, even with careful breeding practices. When those adorable goldendoodle puppies start shedding, or when their human has an allergic reaction, the doodle may be in need of a new home. <br/></p><p>Rescuing an adult goldendoodle is not only a great way to save some money on the purchase price of the dog, but also provides other benefits. You can easily see what an adult goldendoodle's coat is like, how big the dog is and assess its energy level and personality. Goldendoodle puppies may also end up in rescue occasionally. If you are lucky enough to find a goldendoodle puppy available for adoption, and you're not worried about allergies or the eventual adult size of your dog, you could bring home a puppy for a fraction of the cost of buying from a breeder. <br/></p><p>Animal shelters and rescue organizations charge a small adoption fee anywhere from about $200 to upward of $500 depending on the group. This adoption fee generally includes the costs of updated vaccines and a spay or neuter surgery, and helps to ensure the organization can continue its lifesaving work.<br/></p><h2>Cost of Buying a Goldendoodle</h2><p>Buying a goldendoodle puppy from a breeder is the most expensive way to acquire a goldendoodle. However, the cost of a puppy varies wildly. Breeders from different states may charge more, and the cost of a larger size goldendoodle may be different than a smaller goldendoodle. Some breeders also charge more for more desirable colors or coat types.<br/></p><p>Responsible goldendoodle breeders put a lot of money into their breeding programs, which is why their puppies cost a lot. Such breeders purchase or keep high-quality dogs for their breeding programs, perform genetic health screenings on the parents before breeding them, maintain pedigrees and pair dogs thoughtfully to better the breed. <br/></p><p>Reputable breeders also pursue thorough veterinary care for their adult dogs and puppies, feed high-quality diets, register their litters with the proper organization, and never overbreed their females or breed more puppies than they can responsibly care for. Due to the efforts they put in to produce healthy, high-quality dogs, good breeders usually offer a health guarantee on their puppies. <br/></p><p>On the flip side, some lower-quality breeders, sometimes termed ""backyard breeders,"" may still charge ""market price"" for their goldendoodle puppies, but without putting the same efforts into their breeding program. Such breeders may simply breed together any male and female they happen to own and sell the resulting puppies. When a goldendoodle breeder tells you the price of buying a puppy, ask about their breeding program, genetic screening and health guarantees to find out what you are paying for.</p><p>Additionally, be aware that some pets stores sell goldendoodle puppies along with many other breeds of puppies. It is very difficult to obtain accurate information on breeders who supply to pet stores, and in many cases, animal welfare experts worry about these puppies coming from puppy mills. A puppy mill is often described as a commercial dog breeding operation where the goal is to produce as many puppies as possible without regard for their health and the welfare of the breeding dogs. Both the adult dogs and puppies often have poor health, are exposed to more infectious diseases, and tend to have ongoing health problems in additional to coming from inhumane living conditions. For this reason, it is best to avoid purchasing a puppy if it has a questionable origin.<br/></p><p>Expect to pay anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000 for a goldendoodle puppy from a breeder. <br/></p><h2>Ongoing Costs for Goldendoodles</h2><p>Don't forget to factor in future costs of caring for your goldendoodle throughout its lifetime, including veterinary care, pet insurance, food, grooming costs, training, and more. One significant cost to consider for goldendoodles is the cost of professional grooming. Almost all goldendoodles need to have their hair trimmed by a groomer. The curlier and more poodle-like a goldendoodle's coat, the more frequently it will require haircuts. Some goldendoodles may need grooming once a month; others can go about eight weeks in between haircuts. <br/></p><p>Professional grooming for a goldendoodle costs anywhere from $65 to $140 on average, depending on where you live, how big your dog is and whether the coat is very matted or tangled.</p><p>Breen, Matthew. .

79,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mixed-breed-dogs-2804607,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hybrid Dog Breeds,"<h1>The Difference Between a Mutt, Mixed Breed, or Designer Dog?</h1>","<h1>The Difference Between a Mutt, Mixed Breed, or Designer Dog?</h1><p>There are so many types of dog breeds out there and lots of definitions that get thrown around. Many definitions actually mean the same thing, they just have different connotations (both negative and positive).</p><h2>Understanding the Difference</h2><p>To start with a basic understanding of dog breeds, it can be helpful to begin with purebred dogs. These are simply dogs that have registration papers that indicate both parents were registered and of the same breed. It has no bearing on the quality of the dog but simply means that particular canine is only one breed of dog.</p><p>Mixed breed or a designer dog is a different name for what is essentially a mutt. While the word mutt can have a negative connotation, it simply means that the dog's parents were not registered and both parents are not of the same breed. These types of dogs come in a variety of coat types and colors, shapes, and sizes that rival any purebred dog.</p><h2>Mixed Breed Dog Qualities</h2><p>These dogs result from breeding different purebreds or other mixed-breed dogs together. Mixed breed dogs have no pedigree, and usually are the result of accidental matings. They're usually not registered, although there are mixed breed registries that may offer some sort of documentation. Mixed breed dogs often superficially resemble a purebred. They can inherit all the best, or the worst, traits of their parents. It's difficult if not impossible to predict what a mixed breed dog's puppies will look like or how they'll behave. Mixed breed dogs make wonderful pets, though. They are a popular choice for pets all over the world.</p><h2>What's a Designer Dog?</h2><p>The term ""designer dog"" refers to an intentional mixing of breeds and is sometimes called a ""hybrid"" dog. These types of dogs are created by intentionally combining existing breeds to form new ones. Most existing dog breeds were created in this way and likely are hybrids. Many are so ancient, though, their origin is obscure.</p><p>A recent example of a designer or hybrid dog is the Labradoodle, purposely bred to take the low-shedding qualities of a poodle along with a Labrador's temperament for a guide dog. Because Poodles come in three sizes, Labradoodle pups also vary in size and may be more like the Poodle or Labrador side of the family. Hybrid breeders are dedicated to establishing the variety as a true breed. They work to create a predictable type, working with generations of dogs.</p><p>The designer dog label today is used to market hybrid dogs, which may (or may not) be more healthy, cute, trainable, or other fill-in-the-blank claims. Shelters sometimes label mixed breeds as a designer breed to promote adoptions. Puppy mills jumped on the designer dog bandwagon to create boatloads of interesting mixes they sell for high prices.</p><h2>A True Hybrid Dog</h2><p>A rarer type of ""true hybrid"" is a dog that has been crossed with a wild animal, such as a wolf or coyote. These can be intentional pairings or may occur naturally in the wild. These types of animals are not usually recommended as pets, as they are a half-wild animal. Sometimes special permits are required if an owner is planning to keep one as a pet. Some breeders will charge inflated prices for these types of hybrids. Be wary of being scammed or ending up with an expensive and potentially dangerous animal in your home.</p><h2>How to Select a Dog</h2><p>The health and temperament of a puppy should weigh more heavily than any cute factor and marketing ploys. Don't let a designer label or popular puppy fads get in the way of choosing a healthy companion whether pedigree, mutt or designer breed, listen to your head as well as your heart. Any hybrid or designer dog is a mutt, but don't let that connotation make you shy away from a pet that is a good match for you, your lifestyle, and your family. Certain dog breeds (for example, working breed dogs) have been bred historically for their behavior and skills to do certain jobs, and these traits may or may not be helpful for companion animals. Some breeds require more exercise, training, and time to keep healthy and happy.</p><p>Consider your lifestyle and how much time you can commit to a new puppy before making the decision to buy or adopt. If you work long hours, you may have to make arrangements for someone to let your puppy out for bathroom breaks, help in house-training, and exercise your puppy as he/she grows. Certain breeds also require more extensive and ongoing grooming care, which could require additional budgeting to prevent health issues. Consulting with your veterinarian and/or a dog trainer may be worth your time to help determine what kind of dog may be a more ideal fit for your lifestyle and environment.</p><h2>Learning About Your Dog's Genetics</h2><p>If you do have a mixed breed or mutt dog and are curious about what breed or breeds your dog originates from, you may want to use a canine genetic test for your dog. With a simple saliva sample, the tests can provide information about your dog's ancestry and the potential breeds that make up your dog. Some tests can also provide health information, especially as it relates to genetic markers that may be related to specific breeds that are in your dog's DNA.</p>",879

These canines excel at finding, flushing out, and retrieving games across a wide variety of terrain, including water. Spaniels continue to be used for hunting and they're also popular as companion breeds.</p><h3>What is a spaniel?</h3><p>Traditionally bread as hunting companions, spaniels are a medium-sized athletic dog breed. They are often characterized by breed features like drooping ears, a broad muzzle, and wavy fur.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Most spaniels are medium-sized, have distinctive drooping ears, a broad muzzle, and a curly or silky, wavy coat on their ears, tail, and legs. They typically appear in colors like liver and white, red and white, black and white, sometimes deep brown or black. Breeds with long hair will likely need regular grooming to keep their coats mat-free-those with long, hanging ears are also more susceptible to ear infections.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Spaniels tend to be high-energy, agile, and driven. Because of this, they're generally best suited to living in an active household. Problem behaviors can quickly surface if they don't get enough exercise and enrichment. These breeds often make fantastic hiking, canicross, or competitive dog sports partners.</p><p>These are 14 of the most popular spaniel breeds full of affection and fun-loving companionship.</p><h2>American Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>The American cocker spaniel is one of the most popular spaniels. It is the smallest breed in the American Kennel Club Sporting Group. Their compact size, lively personalities, and sweet expression endear them to dog lovers worldwide.

Clumbers tend to be mellow around the home. Although they can be determined once they get a scent, they aren't as fast or active as cockers or springers. They can be wary around strangers, but they respond well to positive training and socialization. Clumbers are notoriously jowly. You'll need to be prepared to clean up a fair amount of drool.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 85 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, dense straight coat in white with yellow or orange markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>English Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>Compact, enthusiastic, and agile, spaniels were once prized as woodcock hunting companions, likely the source of the breed's name.

Often described as velcro dogs, they're best suited to a household where they'll have company for most of the day.</p><p>They share similar characteristics to the American cocker, although their hunting drive tends to be more pronounced.

The typical pointing position shows the dog's body stiffening, holding one paw up in the air, the tail points upwards, and the nose signals towards the scent.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Pointing breeds tend to be active, enthusiastic, intelligent, and eager to please. They often excel in tracking and nose work sports, and, invariably, they're skilled retrievers with a great love of water. A rigorous exercise routine is vital for these driven dogs.</p><p>Pointing breeds are high-energy dogs that require adequate exercise, training, and mental stimulation to keep them from getting bored. A bored pup tends to engage in destructive or mischievous behavior as an exciting activity when not given a regular, motivating exercise regimen.</p><p>Here is more about the history and temperament of 8 popular pointing breeds.</p><h2>Bracco Italiano</h2><p>Also known as the Italian pointer, you can trace the bracco Italiano roots or ""Italian hound"" back to the 5th century. They are one of Europe's oldest pointers. In the early 20th century, a dedicated breeding program helped revive their numbers using two bracco varieties, one from Italy's Piedmont region and the other from the Lombardy region.</p><p>Known for being incredibly reliable in the field, the bracco tends to be more docile at home than other pointing breeds. They're gentle and affectionate dogs that form strong bonds with their family members. The breed tends to drool and is vocal. They're also still relatively rare in North America.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Stock Service/miscellaneous class (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 90 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense, and glossy coat that comes in solid white, white with orange or chestnut patches, orange or chestnut roan</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>Brittany</h2><p>Often referred to as spaniels, the Brittany is a pointing breed. These dogs developed around the 17th century in the Northern region of Brittany. These versatile hunting dogs are compact, medium-sized dogs. Their size, skills, and temperament make these canines a high-demand choice. They tend to be good with other dogs and gentle children. A Brittany can be a sensitive soul prone to separation anxiety, but they're eager to please and respond incredibly well to positive and peaceful training techniques.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17.5 to 20.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Flat or wavy, dense coat that comes in orange and white or liver and white markings and sometimes with roan patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>English Pointer</h2><p>The English pointer is often referred to simply as a pointer. Although it has origins dating back to the 17th century, the breed took shape the following century. These dogs grew in popularity with the growth of the sport of shooting birds in flight in England.</p><p>Nowadays, English pointers are known for being one of the most versatile, hard-working, and popular pointing breeds. They excel in field trials, but with their dynamism and ambition, they also do well in dog sports, including agility, canicross, and obedience. At home, English pointers are loving, loyal, and sweet-tempered.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 75 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense coat; color combinations of white with liver, lemon, orange, or black markings; may have solid coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 17 years</p><h2>English Setter</h2><p>The English setter is the most popular of three silky-coated setters to originate in the United Kingdom. Like the bracco Italiano, this breed has a long heritage. 15th-century art features dogs that look similar to this setter. These dogs grew in popularity in the 18th century with owners of grand English estates that enjoyed hunting.</p><p>Although regarded as a pointing breed, these dogs were initially developed to lay down to ""set"" when they detected their quarry, like their relatives, the Gordon setter and the Irish setter. The breed is known for being incredibly mellow and tends to enjoy the company of gentle children and other dogs. Although English setters still need plenty of exercise, they're often calmer around the home than some pointing breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Long, flat, silky, and a little wavy coat; white coat base with Belton markings that can be flecks or intermingled roan; Belton colors are orange or black (referred to as blue) and can also be tricolored</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>German Shorthaired Pointer</h2><p>Germany is well-known for its diligent development of skilled hunting dogs. Some experts believe them to be the most versatile and capable all-around hunting dog. This breed resulted from the crosses of English and Spanish pointers and the now-extinct German bird dog. By the late 19th century, the breed had an official studbook and imported them to other countries.</p><p>This dog is the most popular pointing pooch in the United States and is among the top 10 of the AKC's overall most popular breeds. GSPs are intelligent, eager to please, happy, and affectionate. They have webbed feet and a great love of water. The German wirehaired pointer is a close relative.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 25 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth coat with a solid liver or a combination of liver and white</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Spinone Italiano</h2><p>Caroline Granycome / Wikimedia Commons / Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic</p><p></p><p>The spinone Italiano is another Italian pointing breed. These dogs hail from the country's Piedmont region and got their name from the thorny ""spino"" undergrowth they had to negotiate when hunting. Their coarse fur and thick skin helped protect them when they were tracking in rough terrain. The breed almost became extinct after the World Wars. They're still one of the rarer pointing breeds, but their numbers have steadily increased.</p><p>One of the biggest pointing breeds, the spinone, appeals to some owners as they tend to be more docile than some of their relatives. They can sometimes be stubborn and may need a little more patience and tasty treats when training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22.5 to 27.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 90 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Harsh, coarse, dense, flat single coat with a distinct set of bushy eyebrows and beard; solid white, white and orange, and white with brown markings; markings can be roan or solid colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Vizsla</h2><p>The Hungarian vizsla (meaning ""tracker"") can be traced to the 8th century when ancient Magyar clans roamed the country. These agile dogs had great endurance, making them invaluable hunting partners for the tribesman. They were highly prized by the nobleman of the country for their speed and versatility.</p><p>Vizslas are incredibly big-hearted, dedicated to their owners, and adaptable. Often referred to as ""velcro dogs."" They love being in the company of their humans. They can be prone to separation anxiety. They are closely related to wirehaired vizslas, a separate breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 22 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Copper or rust-colored short, smooth, dense coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Weimaraner</h2><p>The Weimaraner is another German breed that is known for its pointing skills. Although hunters initially used them for searching for big game, the Weimaraner began to gain popularity as an all-around gun dog. They showed a natural aptitude towards pointing and retrieving and became much prized in Germany and worldwide. These dogs are known for being intelligent problem solvers. They need lots of enrichment to keep them entertained and prevent them from creating mayhem at home. Weimaraners adore being around people.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 70 to 85 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, smooth mouse gray or silver-gray coat</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 13 years</p><h2></h2>",1270
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/types-of-retrievers-2804738,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Sporting Dog Breeds,<h1>6 Dog Breeds That Are Retrievers</h1>,"<h1>6 Dog Breeds That Are Retrievers</h1><p>Two retrievers have ranked in the top three dog breeds in the U.S. for decades: Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers. These breeds have historically been used for hunting birds (particularly ducks and other waterfowl), but they are also well-known for being excellent family pets. Retrievers are incredibly popular for their sweet demeanor and energetic personalities.</p><h3>What is a Retriever Dog?</h3><p>Retrievers include six breeds of dogs recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC). Classified as sporting dogs, retrievers are bred to assist hunters by bringing back small game during the hunt.</p><p>Golden retrievers and Labs may be the most well-known types in this group, but there are several other dog breeds under this classification. They are similar in look and temperament but have some distinct differences.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you plan to introduce a dog into your family life, seek out a reputable breeder or dog rescue organization. Be honest with the breeder or organization about your home life situation, including the time you can spend with the dog. They can help you determine if the dog's traits will fit well with the lifestyle you lead.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Retrievers are hunting or gun dogs. When a hunter shoots down a bird, the dog spots it in the air and retrieves it. Retrievers have webbed paws that enable better swimming ability. They also have soft mouths, which means when they grab a bird with its mouth, they don't bite down on it, which could render it inedible for their human companions. Retrievers are great at following directions and are eager to please their people. They are patient, intelligent dogs that learn quickly. These qualities make them suitable as working dogs for assistive service, therapy, detection, and search and rescue. And, if you plan to play fetch with your dog, as you can probably guess, these dogs are always game.</p><p>Here are the six main retriever dogs to consider.</p><h2>Labrador Retriever</h2><p>Labrador retrievers are the most popular dog breed in the U.S. since 1991, according to the AKC, Labrador retrievers are high-spirited and sweet-natured. They have yellow, black, or chocolate brown coats and weigh between 55 to 80 pounds, males usually weighing more. This type of retriever is known for its short, dense fur coat, an otter-like tail that's incredibly strong, and a good temperament. Labrador retrievers have a long history as the canine friend of Newfoundland fishermen and women. Their quick rise to popularity began in the early 1800s when English nobles brought the breed back to the U.K.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 24.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense double coat comes in black, chocolate, or yellow</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Golden Retriever</h2><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Medium-length, double coat; light to dark gold</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Chesapeake Bay Retriever</h2><p>Also known as ""Chessies,"" the Chesapeake Bay retriever is a powerful, stout dog. This breed is larger and sturdier than the other retrievers. Its coat is dense, wavy, and waterproof. They come in three colors-chocolate brown, sedge (red-gold), and dead grass (straw). Their eyes are always a yellowish or amber hue. The name comes from the breed's popularity among wealthy owners of duck clubs along the Chesapeake Bay during the 19th century. Sporting an oily, thick double coat, these retrievers could withstand the chilly waters of the Bay. Chessies are the third most popular type of retriever in America and have a similarly bright, happy disposition and noted intelligence as goldens and Labs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 21 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 80 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, wavy, waterproof coat; comes in solid shades of brown, deadgrass, and sedge</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Flat-Coated Retriever</h2><p></p><p>The gentle, cheerful, and energetic flat-coated retriever has, as the name suggests, a flat-lying coat that's either black or liver and feathers at the legs and tail. Like golden retrievers, you should brush this breed weekly to mitigate shedding. Flat-coated retrievers were first bred in the mid-1800s and called the ""gamekeeper's dog"" until the Lab and golden took over in popularity. Flat-coated retrievers had been the top retriever in Britain. Their numbers plummeted during WWI and WWII when it looked like the breed would go extinct. Their popularity began to rise again in the 1960s. Flat-coated retrievers are usually quick to train, but they don't reach full maturity until 3 to 5 years old. They're known as the ""Peter Pan"" of retrievers because they seem never to grow up, showcasing their puppy ways into old age.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 24.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Moderate length coat that lies flat; comes in solid black or brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Curly-Coated Retriever</h2><p>The curly-coated retriever is the oldest of the retriever breeds. It first appeared in the late 1700s. Their coat, either black or liver, consists of tight, waterproof curls. Unlike other retrievers, the curly-coated type features a tapered, wedge-shaped head. Although this type of retriever is friendly and playful with loved ones, they're more independent than other varieties and a little less friendly to strangers. Curly-coated retrievers reportedly descended from two extinct dog breeds, the English water spaniel and the retrieving setter. Some suspect that the distinctive, low-shedding curls may come from a cross with poodles too.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, tight curls lying close to the body; solid black or liver</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 13 years</p><h2>Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever</h2><p>The Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever is the smallest of the retrievers. but it's a beautiful, compact dog with a dense double coat that's golden red to dark copper red on the body with white markings on the face, chest, and paws. The tolling retriever requires weekly brushing most of the year and daily brushing during the shedding season because of its double coat, This retriever was bred in Nova Scotia. It has a curious nature and quick movements to catch waterfowl. The term ""tolling"" refers to drawing waterfowl toward the hunter in the style of a fox, which the breed is known for. Nova Scotia duck tolling retrievers joined the AKC sporting group in 2003.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short to medium length coat, usually straight; copper, crimson, and golden-red</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 14 years</p><h2>Breeds to Avoid</h2><p>Dogs that are harder to train, seem more aloof or stubborn, and are the exact opposite of retrievers. These dogs aren't ""bad,"" they're just more independent (like spitz breeds), and in most cases, some of the smartest dogs since they seem to have a mind of their own. These dogs include Akitas, shiba inus, and chow chows.</p><p>Another characteristic that's indicative of retrievers is their soft mouth or gentle bite. Dogs like terriers and ratters have a contrary form of hunting style, they catch, roughly shake, mangle, and destroy the rats or other vermin they were tasked with dispatching. You'd likely want to avoid Jack Russell terriers, rat terriers, Cairn terriers, or Westies.</p><p>While they are both fantastic dogs, the biggest difference between the two is that the golden retriever is more relaxed, needs more grooming, and can be less expensive than the Labrador. On the other hand, labs are easier to train (and quicker to pick up new tasks) and tend to have a more muscular build, leading them to weigh a bit more.</p>",1225
82,https://www.thesprucepets.com/setter-dog-breeds-4842681,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Sporting Dog Breeds,<h1>4 Types of Setter Dog Breeds</h1>,"<h1>4 Types of Setter Dog Breeds</h1><p>If you're seeking an active canine companion, an adept hunting dog, or a loyal family pet, consider a setter breed. The Irish setter, Gordon setter, English setter, and Irish red and white setter are four outstanding dogs that thrive in the field and at home. Each of these setters shares an aptitude for hunting and a family-first disposition that makes them much-loved companions. However, each breed has its own unique traits as well.</p><p>Here are four setter dog breeds that might suit your lifestyle.</p><h2>Setter Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Setter breeds gained their name and notoriety as hunting dogs for their instinctive tendency to crouch, or ""set,"" when they find their quarry. Typically, a setter will take a low stance with its body nearly touching the ground and its attention firmly fixed on the game. In the past, this position allowed hunters to cast a net over the game without being obstructed by the dog's body. Today, it's not as necessary with the use of firearms in hunting, but it remains a characteristic mark of setter breeds nonetheless.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>As hunting dogs, setter breeds often don't get along with small animal pets in the home. Their prey drive might even cause them to chase cats and small dogs, though with proper training and socialization from a young age many setters can coexist fine with other pets.</p><h2>Irish Setter</h2><p>The Irish setter is a beautiful example of a setter dog breed. Easily identified by its rich mahogany coat with flowing locks and feathering, the red setter (as the breed is sometimes called) was originally developed in Ireland as a steady and capable birding dog.</p><p>These dogs have an innate ability to locate game birds and signal their presence to a hunting companion. From a young age, many Irish setters display a drive to please their owners, and they take to fieldwork quickly. Irish setters are known to be excellent family dogs and mellow housemates, as long as they get consistent training and exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Flat, silky, long, soft coat with deep chestnut red or mahogany coloring; feathering on the chest, belly, legs, tail, and ears; neck and tail outstretch to point in the direction of game</p><h2>Gordon Setter</h2><p>The largest of the setter breeds, there is no mistaking the Gordon setter. With its large bone structure and distinctive black-and-tan coat, the Gordon stands out. This dog can trace its roots back to northern Scotland where Alexander the Fourth, Duke of Gordon developed a hunting dog capable of traversing the hilly Scottish countryside. The dog's large stature served it well in the inclement weather, and the breed was further optimized for stamina over speed.</p><p>The United Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1872, calling it the black and tan setter. In 1924, the name changed to Gordon setter. The breed possesses a family-friendly disposition, but it does have a strong protective instinct. Early socialization and training are key to encourage a friendly and obedient nature.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium to large build; shiny coat that is straight or wavy with feathering on the ears, chest, legs, and tail; coat is characteristically black with tan markings</p><h2>English Setter</h2><p>Smaller in stature than the Gordon and Irish setters, the English setter stands out for its freckled coat and pleasant demeanor. Its white base coat has either orange or black markings (referred to as ""belton""), or it can be tricolor in appearance. Good looks and temperament aside, this breed has been developed to excel in setting and retrieving game birds.</p><p>The English setter is believed to have descended from a cross of pointer and spaniel breeds, though its exact origin is unknown. Today, English setters often show a strong desire to bond closely with their families, and they don't like being left alone for long periods. They also need a lot of exercise and mental stimulation to keep them happy and healthy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 65 to 80 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Athletic build; long ears; feathering on the legs; long, flat, silky, and a little wavy coat in various colors</p><h2>Irish Red and White Setter</h2><p>Although the all-red Irish setter has more notoriety among the setter breeds, the Irish red and white setter (also referred to as the IRWS) actually was the first Irish-bred setter on the scene. Believed to have originated in Ireland in the 17th century, the bright coloring of the red and white setter stood out against the landscape and allowed hunters to easily track their dogs in pursuit of game birds.</p><p>Over time, the solid red setter was developed through selective breeding of the IRWS, eventually leading to a separate breed standard for the IRWS and Irish setter. Besides their coat colors being different, the IRWS is slightly smaller than the Irish setter. But they show just as much durability and athleticism as their setter cousins.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 35 to 60 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdy, athletic build; white coat with distinct red patches; feathering along the ears, legs, body, and tail</p><p>Setters are a number of breeds of sporting dogs. There are four types.</p><p>Mature English setters weigh from 56 to 65 pounds.</p><p>Yes! They're laid back perfect for kids gentle, friendly, and smart.</p><p>Setters are moderate shedders.</p>",854

The strong, energetic, and sometimes stubborn Airedale Terrier needs lots of obedience training from early on in life, and plenty of vigorous daily exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 23 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Strong and well-balanced. The hard, wiry, dense, straight, short coat is a mix of tan and black or dark grizzle, with tan head and ears.</p><h2>Bedlington Terrier</h2><p></p><p>The Bedlington Terrier originated in England, in the 1800s, where they hunted rats and other vermin on farms and in coal mines. With a sleek, sighthound shape, they look and feel like little lambs.</p><p>Although they are known for being sweet and gentle, they are mightily courageous and tenacious when they have a furry critter in their sights.</p><p>The soft coat does not shed much (if at all) but requires professional grooming every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 15.5 to 17.5 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 17 to 23 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Graceful, lithe and well-balanced. The crisp coat, which is a mixture of hard and soft hair, comes in blue, sandy, or liver, sometimes combined with tan.</p><h2>Bull Terrier</h2><p>The Bull Terrier was originally bred in England to be a fierce competitor in dogfighting rings, but when that brutal sport was outlawed, the breed was tweaked into the distinguished and sweet companion that it is today.</p><p>The Bully is brimming with personality and has one of the most unique faces of the dog kingdom, with a long face that resembles that of a horse. The Bull Terrier can be stubborn, so early, consistent training is a must.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 21 to 22 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Strongly built, muscular and symmetrical. The short coat comes in almost any color including white, red, fawn, black, blue, or brindle (or a combination of these).</p><h2>Cairn Terrier</h2><p>Made famous as Dorothy's little dog Toto in the 1939 film the Cairn Terrier originated in the Scottish Highlands more than two centuries ago. The hardy, fierce little dogs rooted out foxes, rats, and other furry critters from piles of rocks called cairns, from which the breed derived its name.</p><p>Friendly and outgoing, Cairn Terriers typically make wonderful family dogs. Care includes weekly brushing and moderate exercise.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 9 to 10 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 to 15 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Active, hardy, short-legged working terrier; the wiry double coat may be a wide variety of colors, commonly black, cream and grey, often with a brindle mix.</p><h2>Irish Terrier</h2><p>With its fiery red coat and intense expression, the medium-sized, sturdy Irish Terrier is unmistakable. As the breed name suggests, this dog comes from Ireland, where it was a jack of all trades-hunting down rats and mice, guarding the farmstead, and serving as a devoted family companion.</p><p>Strong-willed and full of energy, the Irish Terrier needs a good amount of daily exercise and consistent training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 15.5 to 17.5 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 17 to 23 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Medium-sized with moderately long back and legs. The dense, wiry coat comes in bright red, golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten.</p><h2>Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>The Jack Russell Terrier was developed in England in the 1800s by a vicar by the name of John Jack&rdquo; Russell. He created two varieties of hunting terriers, one with longer legs (the Parson Russell Terrier) and one that was slightly smaller with shorter legs (the Jack Russell Terrier). Both types of terriers were excellent fox and rabbit hunters, as well as vermin dispatchers.</p><p>Intense little dogs with endless energy, Jack Russell Terriers need a lot of exercise, play, mental stimulation, and training.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Small, muscular and slightly longer than tall. The short coat can be smooth or rough, and is white with black, tan or brown markings.</p><h2>Kerry Blue Terrier</h2><p></p><p>A working terrier that originated in the mountains of County Kerry, Ireland, more than a century ago, the Kerry Blue Terrier had varied talents, including hunting, retrieving, and even herding livestock.</p><p>All Kerry Blue Terrier puppies are born black. The coat gradually fades to the distinctive blue-gray color as the dog matures. The final color of adult Kerry Blue Terriers can vary from a deep slate blue to light blue-gray. Kerries do not shed much, but they require professional grooming every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 19 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 30 to 40 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Upstanding and in good balance, with a well-developed and muscular body. The short soft, wavy coat is blue-gray in color.</p><h2>Miniature Schnauzer</h2><p>The Miniature Schnauzer is a bred-down version of the larger Standard Schnauzer. Both Schnauzer breeds, as well as their cousin, the Giant Schnauzer, originated in Germany, where they were indispensable working farm dogs and rat catchers.</p><p>Miniature Schnauzers are spirited and playful and need moderate daily activity. The wiry coat, which forms the breed's trademark beard, mustache, and eyebrows, requires professional grooming every few months.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 12 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 11 to 19 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sturdily built, nearly square in proportion, with plenty of bone. The wiry double coat may be salt and pepper, black and silver, or solid black.</p><h2>Norwich Terrier</h2><p>Named after its city of origin in England, the Norwich Terrier hunted foxes, working in large packs and running alongside the hunters. The Norwich Terrier is one of the smallest of all the terrier breeds, but brave as they come and big on love.</p><p>It's closely related to the Norfolk Terrier, which they resemble closely (the main difference being the Norfolk Terrier's folded ears versus the Norwich Terrier's upright ears).</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 10 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Stocky, hardy, and with good bone and substance. The hard, wiry, straight coat comes in red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle.</p><h2>Rat Terrier</h2><p>Though most terriers originated in Great Britain, the Rat Terrier was developed in the United States in the early 1900s, where it was used to hunt and kill rats and other rodents on farms.</p><p>Rat Terriers come in two sizes: miniature and standard. They are high-spirited, energetic, and determined little dogs that need a good amount of daily exercise and play to stay content.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 13 inches tall at the shoulder (miniature); 13 to 18 inches (standard)</p><p>WEIGHT: 10 to 25 pounds</p><p>Physical characteristics: Sturdy, compact and small to medium sized.

The truth is, when well-bred and properly socialized, pit bulls are very friendly, people-oriented pets. With their high energy level and strength, though, pit bulls are not for everyone. But if you decide that the pit bull is a good fit, you will find them to be extremely intelligent and eager to learn. They often excel at obedience training and dog sports.</p><p>Unfortunately, what many people know about pit bulls comes from the news stories they hear about dog fighting or pit bull attacks. This is one of the reasons it is so important to make the extra effort to train your pit bull. A well-trained pit bull can be an ambassador for its breed, showing the world that with a loving home and training, pit bulls can make wonderful pets.</p><h2>Start Socializing Your Puppy Early</h2><p>If you have a young pitbull puppy or are planning on getting one soon, make socialization your top priority. It is important that your pit bull puppy learns to be comfortable with a variety of people and situations from a very early age. Expose it to children, men, women, and other animals. Get your pet used to being handled. Keep things positive and upbeat, and allow your pit bull puppy to approach new things in its own time. This early socialization is the most important component of your puppy's training program.</p><h2>Use Positive Reinforcement to Train Your Pit Bull</h2><p>Because of their muscular build and strength, training that requires leash corrections or other punishment is not always effective with pit bulls. You will probably have better results with positive reinforcement techniques, such as clicker training or other reward-based training. Most pit bulls are eager learners and will be happy to work for the rewards.</p><h2>Teach Your Pit Bull to Behave Properly With Other Dogs</h2><p>Because pit bulls have a history of being bred as fighting dogs, they are not always tolerant of other dogs. You can keep control over your dog in the presence of other dogs by teaching it to focus on you. This is when the ""look"" command comes in handy. Other commands that can help include stay, come, and the emergency recall. To ensure that your dog will respond to your commands, even when it may be distracted by other dogs, take the time to practice commands in a variety of settings and situations. It's important that your dog can respond to your commands when you are at the park just as well as it does in your living room. This step of training is referred to as proofing.</p><p>It's important to remember, however, that each dog is an individual. Some do well in households with other dogs, while others show aggression toward other dogs. It can't be stressed enough that aggression toward dogs does not equal aggression toward humans. Just because a pit bull is intolerant of other dogs does not mean it is going to be aggressive toward people.</p><h2>Consider Canine Good Citizen Certification</h2><p>The Canine Good Citizen Program was developed by the American Kennel Club (AKC). It involves testing your dog on several skills, and if it passes the test, the dog gets a Canine Good Citizen certificate from the AKC. To pass the test, your pit bull must know some basic obedience skills, be able to walk through a crowd, accept being petted by strangers, and not react to other dogs it passes. You also must sign the Responsible Pet Owners Pledge.</p><p>Any dog can benefit from the Canine Good Citizen Program. For pit bulls, it can also provide proof that you have a well-behaved, friendly pet. It is something you can show potential landlords or neighbors as proof that your dog is a good canine citizen. It's just one more step in changing the public's perception of the pit bull as a vicious dog.</p><p>The American Kennel Club website can help you find Canine Good Citizen classes and evaluators.</p><h2>Teach Through Advanced Training and Dog Sports</h2><p>Pit bulls are usually energetic and fun to train. Many of them do well in advanced obedience and dog sports, such as agility or rally obedience. These activities are a great way to have fun and bond with your pit bull and reinforce good behavior at the same time. Advanced obedience and dog sports have the added benefit of offering the perfect combination of exercise and mental stimulation that these active and intelligent dogs crave.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing</h2><p>A well-trained dog will be able to take its cues from you rather than reacting to the presence of another dog. If you are having trouble keeping your dog from showing aggression toward other dogs, consider working with a trainer. A lot of training facilities offer classes to help with just this problem. You may see them referred to as Feisty Fido or reactive dog classes.</p><p>When it comes down to it, pit bulls are really no different when it comes to training than any other dogs. The difference comes from the public's perception of pit bulls. Take the time to train your pit bull, and you will have a happy and healthy member of the family who is truly an ambassador of its breed.</p><h3>Watch Now: The Tool That Tricks Your Dog into Loving Baths</h3>",872

Check out these tiny but mighty pups</h2><p>Good things really can come in small packages. Case in point: these toy dog breeds, which in addition to being downright adorable make excellent companions.</p><p>Of course, all dogs are good dogs, but all dogs are also unique in terms of personality and temperament. If you're looking at toy dog breeds, these are great ones to set your sights on, though make sure to visit with a pup before committing so that you can make sure you're a perfect match.</p><p>With that in mind, here are 19 toy dog breeds that make excellent pets.</p><h3>What is a toy dog breed?</h3><p>The phrase ""toy"" refers to a very small dog, often weighing less than 15 pounds. They have been selectively bred to be small through several generations and can range in type, appearance, and temperament.</p><h2>Toy Dog Breed Characteristics</h2><p>There are a lot of benefits to going pocket-sized with your pup, including easier handling and less fur-pick up. Toy dog breeds also tend to have lower veterinary costs than medium and large breed dogs, and fewer space and exercise needs, too-which is good news if you live in an apartment or smaller home.</p><h2>1. Chihuahua</h2><p>Chihuahuas are small dogs with huge personalities, and they're as trainable as they are tiny. Chis tend to become super attached to their humans and don't often tolerate being left alone for long periods of time, but it's easy to forgive their clinginess when you realize just how fun they are to be around.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 to 6 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short or long coats in a variety of solid or two-combination colors, including black, tan, fawn, cream, white, blue, silver, chocolate, and red.</p><h2>2. Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie)</h2><p>Yorkies are one of the most popular toy dog breeds, thanks in no small part to their tendency to be both highly affectionate and always down to play. They aren't always kid-friendly though, so keep that in mind if you have human little ones at home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 7 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long, straight, and silky coat in a variety of color combinations, including black and gold, black and tan, blue and gold, and blue and tan.</p><h2>3. Pug</h2><p>The Pug's wrinkles, snorts, and curly tail are hard to resist, as are its sweet nature and fun-loving personality. What Pugs lack in trainability they more than make up for in friendliness, and they're an excellent toy breed for families with children and other pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 18 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Smooth and short coat in fawn or black, with a round head and smushed face.</p><h2>4. Maltese</h2><p>If you know your way around a dog brush, then consider the Maltese-a toy dog with a long, silky coat that loves a good grooming. Maltese are charming lap dogs with lots of smarts, and they enjoy a leisurely snooze as much as a walk around the block.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 7 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long and silky single-layer white coat without an undercoat.</p><h2>5.

Japanese Chin</h2><p>The Japanese Chin, also known as the Japanese Spaniel, is a noble toy breed out of Asia. These affectionate pups are still a rather rare breed this side of the Pacific, but if you're looking for a small dog with cat-like tendencies they may be worth seeking out.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 9 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long, sleek, and smooth coat in a variety of color combinations, including black and white, lemon and white, sable and white, and black, white and tan.</p><h2>7. Italian Greyhound</h2><p>Italian Greyhounds offer all of the great qualities of standard Greyhounds in a smaller package, including lightning-fast speed and high levels of affection toward their humans. And it certainly doesn't hurt that they're also kid-friendly, pet-friendly, and always up for some playtime.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 14 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short and smooth coat in gray, black, fawn, chocolate, tan, cream, red, sable, or a combination.</p><h2>8. Havanese</h2><p>Havanese have a long history (they date all the way back to 1500's Cuba!), which is a testament to their ability to endear themselves to humans. They're smart, good-natured, and loving and can also be trained to make great therapy dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 8.5 to 11.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 13 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Coat varies from silky straight to curly, with one or two colors that may include black, silver, white, cream, tan, fawn, gold, sable, or red.</p><h2>9. Miniature Pinscher (Min Pin)</h2><p>Another small dog with big dog vibes, the Min Pin is known as the King of Toys&rdquo; for its intelligence-and its stubbornness. Min Pins are friendly and high-energy, though they have a tendency to bark that might not make them the best fit for apartment dwellers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 10 to 12.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 10 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short, solid coat that's usually black with rust or red markings.</p><h2>10. Pekingese</h2><p>Pekingese have a unique and dignified personality that's been around since their days of favor among Chinese royals.

Brussels Griffon (Griffs)</h2><p>Griffs are smart and sturdy, with a reputation as one of the natural entertainers of the toy breed world. They've got a ton of personality and almost-human-like features, as well as a sensitive nature that occasionally leans toward self-importance-in the most adorable way possible, of course.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 7 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 12 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Smooth or rough coat in red, black and tan, or solid black.</p><h2>13. Silky Terrier</h2><p>Silky Terriers may just look like Yorkies, but this breed is all their own, exhibiting endearing traits like high affection and intelligence levels. And while they're not always keen on being a lap dog, they do love to socialize and play.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: About 10 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Long, straight coat in blue and tan.</p><h2>14. Toy Poodle</h2><p>Like other types of Poodles, the Toy Poodle is confident and whip-smart, with lots of affection for the special human(s) in their life.

It's great if a teacup pup is lucky enough to make it to adolescence, but that does not mean the dog is out of the woods. Several breeds like teacup Yorkies, pugs, and Pomeranians have markedly shorter lifespans than their larger counterparts. If you want to get a smaller dog, look at toy breeds and get a dog at the lower end of the acceptable height and weight levels. The higher risk of heartache from premature puppy death is avoidable by steering clear of teacup breeds.</p><p>It depends on the breed, but the average life span for a teacup dog is nine to 15 years.</p><p>Teacup dogs have been created by intentionally breeding the runts of the litter, making a smaller and smaller dog.</p><p>The teacup Chihuahua, weighing in at under 6 pounds and under 5 inches tall, is the smallest teacup breed.</p>",1067

Making an informed decision can be the difference between bringing a healthy dog and an unhealthy dog into the family.</p><p>Read on to learn more about teacup dogs, and why they might not be the best pet for your family.</p><h2>When Is a Dog Considered ""Teacup"" Size?</h2><p>Before we dive into the details, it's important to understand the characteristics that actually define a ""teacup"" dog.</p><p>Although there's no single breed of teacup dogs rather, a number of breeds like Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, and Maltese can be bred as micros there is a weight range that can qualify a pooch as a teacup. Teacup dogs may way as little as two pounds, and measure fewer than 17 inches when fully grown. What's more, ""toy"" breeds include any dogs that weigh less than 15 pounds, so teacup dogs can be considered part of the ""toy"" classification, too.</p><h2>How Are ""Teacup"" Dogs Bred?</h2><p>There's a lot of controversy around the breeding techniques breeders use to produce such tiny dogs. It's difficult to hear, but many of these techniques can be extremely detrimental to the dogs' health and happiness.</p><p>What's more, an unethical breeder may simply market normal-sized, smaller breeds as ""teacup.""</p><p>It's incredibly important to do your research before bringing any dog into your home. Be sure to find an ethical, reputable breeder, or consider adopting from your local animal shelter. Not only are teacup dogs extremely expensive, but adding an unhealthy pet to the family can have serious consequences for your family members, other pets, and the dog.</p><h2>Is It Even Possible to Find an Ethical Teacup Breeder?</h2><p>The short answer? Yes, it is possible to find an ethical breeder that teacup dogs the keyword being ""has."" Sometimes, an ethical breeder will have a litter with smaller-than-average pups that he or she can still give a health guarantee. This may be a rare occurrence, but it is the most ethical way to find a teacup. Because it is hard to know the origin of puppies at the pet store, you cannot be certain that those puppies weren't unethically bred.</p><p>If you're having a hard time locating an ethical teacup dog, you might want to consider toy dog breeds, which are smaller dogs, but a healthier size and weight for their standard.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Issues</h2><p>Different dog breeds experience different health issues, but heart disease, diabetes, and issues with vision, like cataracts, are common among all breeds. Because teacups are so small, however, they often experience health issues related to their size.</p><p>Teacup dogs are also more prone to being stepped on, sat on, or dropped simply because they're so tiny. If you have young children, a teacup dog might not be the right choice for you.</p><p>It's important to note that not every teacup dog will experience these health issues, but potential teacup pup parents should be well aware of the risks.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>When it comes to teacup dogs, research (and maybe even a little bit of patience) is key. It is possible to have a happy, healthy teacup dog with the right amount of research.</p><p>Yordy J, Kraus C, Hayward JJ, et al.

While these unique breeds usually work on farms to protect herds of cattle, sheep, and other animal herds, they can also make great family dogs for the right owners.</p><h3>What is a Mountain Dog?</h3><p>Mountain dogs are breeds that either originated in or work in mountainous regions. Most mountain dogs were bred to be livestock guardian dogs, and others may work as search and rescue dogs in the frigid, snowy mountains.</p><p>Many of these breeds today are raised to live as household companions. Here, find 8 dog breeds that are right at home living in the mountains.</p><h2>Breed Characteristics</h2><p>Most mountain dogs are large, powerful, and protective. They are considered expert-level breeds best left in the hands of experienced dog owners who know how to train and handle guardian breeds. Some breeds are so stocky and powerful that they historically pulled carts loaded with goods to sell at the market.</p><h2>Appenzeller Sennenhund</h2><p>The Appenzeller Sennenhund is one of four related Swiss mountain dog breeds developed to work on farms, herd livestock, and pull heavy carts. The other three are the Bernese mountain dog, the Entlebucher mountain dog, and the greater Swiss mountain dog. All four breeds are similarly tricolored (black and white with tan markings), but their coat type and size vary. The Appenzeller Sennenhund, also called the Appenzeller mountain dog or Appenzell cattle dog, was primarily used to herd cattle and guard the farm. They have high exercise and training needs, are apprehensive of strangers, and are best left to expert-level owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Stock Service (AKC); not grouped</p><p>Height: 20 to 22 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 50 to 75 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, straight double coat is a tricolor combination of black or brown with white and tan markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 14 years</p><h2>Bernese Mountain Dog</h2><p>The Bernese mountain dog is the only one of the four related Swiss mountain dog breeds to have a long coat; it is the largest. It originated near Berne, where it was a general-purpose farm dog used as a watchdog, property guard, and carting dog. Intelligent and devoted to family, the Bernese mountain dog gets along well with children and most other pets. Although Berners are naturally protective, they are rarely aggressive. This breed needs moderate daily exercise, and you will need to brush out the thick coat at least weekly to keep shedding under control.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 70 to 115 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, moderately long, slightly wavy, or straight coat is tricolored (jet black with white and tan markings)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 8 years</p><h2>Caucasian Shepherd Dog</h2><p>The Caucasian shepherd dog originated in the Caucasus mountain range, an expansive region between Europe and Asia. The breed guarded livestock and protected the homestead. It takes a bold, fearless, self-confident, and fierce stance when defending its flock. It is a teddy bear with family and other family pets. They can be challenging to train. Caucasian sheepdogs are a powerful breed best left to expert-level dog owners who have experience with large guarding breeds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Stock Service (AKC); not grouped</p><p>Height: 23 to 30 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 99 to 170 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Double coat ranges from short to heavy and comes in solid, brindle, or spotted colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Entlebucher Mountain Dog</h2><p>The Entlebucher mountain dog, also called the Entlebucher Sennehund or cattle dog, is the smallest and fastest of the four related Swiss mountain dog breeds. It needed speed for its primary job as a cattle drover. The breed was also used as an all-purpose farm dog and property guard in the Entlebuch valley, where it originated. Entlebuchers are intelligent and independent but also utterly devoted to their human families. They love to play and generally get along well with gentle children. Though on the smaller side, Entlebuchers need a great deal of exercise to be content. Training is challenging for these strong-willed dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Foundation Stock Service (AKC); not grouped</p><p>Height: 16 to 21 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, dense, coarse coat is tricolored (jet black with white and tan markings)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 to 15 years</p><h2>Great Pyrenees</h2><p>With its great size and white coat, the Great Pyrenees is magnificent to behold. The breed gets its name from the Pyrenees mountain range between Spain and France. These dogs worked high on the slopes of the mountains, guarding over flocks of sheep and protecting them from bears and wolves. The Great Pyrenees is deeply devoted to its family and watchful over its home. Though large, they are calm in the house and need only moderate daily exercise to be happy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25 to 32 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 100 to 150 pounds (males); 85 to 110 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat is always white, though it may have markings of gray, tan, badger, or reddish-brown</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Greater Swiss Mountain Dog</h2><p>The greater Swiss mountain dog is the largest and oldest of the four Swiss mountain dog breeds. The Swissy was a hardworking farm dog that did it all: herding livestock, working in the pastures, guarding property, and pulling heavy carts to the market. They are excellent watchdogs that sound the alarm in the presence of suspicious strangers near the home. Swissys are highly devoted to their family. These dogs need moderate daily exercise, and many enjoy pulling carts. They need extensive socialization as puppies to avoid shyness in their adulthood.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 29 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 85 to 140 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short double coat that is tricolored (jet black, white, and tan markings)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 11 years</p><h2>Kuvasz</h2><p>The kuvasz is a large, all-white livestock guardian used in Hungary since the Middle Ages to protect horses, sheep, and cattle from predators and thieves. This breed hails from Hungary but likely originated in the steppes of Siberia's Ural Mountains. This dog generally gets along well with respectful children; they are loyal, devoted, and protective of their family. The kuvasz needs early socialization as puppies, lifelong training, and much daily exercise. The breed is usually not recommended for novice dog owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 26 to 30 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 70 to 115 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick double coat, usually medium in length; all white and ranges from straight to wavy</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Saint Bernard</h2><p>The majestic and steadfast Saint Bernard is famous for rescuing travelers in peril on the snowy slopes of the Swiss Alps. Monks developed the breed at the St. Bernard Monastery and Hospice, which Bernard de Menthon founded during the 11th century. Today's Saint Bernard is a gentle and faithful companion. They get along great with kids and love to be part of family activities. Saint Bernards are very large, calm, and laidback. A few short walks a day is all they need for exercise, though many are up for more activity. Saint Bernards drool a lot, so if slobber grosses you out, this isn't the best breed for fastidious dog owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 130 to 180 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short and smooth or long and silky; comes in white with red, brown, or brindle markings</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p>",1245

These dogs are powerful, robust breeds with the intelligence and endurance to get the job done. Many strong dogs are selected to work alongside people as police and military dogs, guards, search and rescue dogs, or herding or hunting.</p><h2>Rottweiler</h2><p>Like many dog breeds, Rottweilers were initially bred to herd large animals, pull carts, and serve as security dogs. To do their jobs, they had to be extremely big and strong. Today's Rottweilers still tend to nudge objects, other animals, and people. They can be great family dogs, but Rottweilers don't pair well with the elderly or families with small kids; their prodding can topple people who are prone to falling.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 80 to 130 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short double coat that comes in black with tan, rust, or mahogany coloring</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Great Dane</h2><p>Great Danes are massive and have sweet, calm personalities; they are the ""gentle giants"" of the dog world. Great Danes were originally bred to be powerful boar hunting dogs that could hold their prey until the hunter caught up. Over time, they became watchdogs and family companions. As they became popular family dogs, breeders selectively bred out their tough, hunting personalities to make them the gentle, sweet dogs we know today.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 28 to 34 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 100 to 200 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, coarse hair that comes in black, blue, brindle, fawn, and other color variations</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Siberian Husky</h2><p>Stories about huskies are well known; they have incredible strength that allows them to pull heavy sleds across challenging, snowy terrain. But how did these sled dogs get so strong? About 3,000 years ago, the nomadic Chukchi tribe in Siberia first bred the Chukchi dog to pull their heavy hunting sleds across long distances. In addition to brute strength, the Chukchi dog possessed an extremely warm winter coat and astounding metabolism. These dogs could constantly exercise with minimal food. The Siberian husky is a direct descendant of the Chukchi dog and still has incredible strength, speed, and endurance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 20 to 23.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 35 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Dense, double coat that comes in a variety of colors; blue or gold eyes</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><h2>German Shepherd</h2><p>German shepherds have been employed as working dogs for hundreds of years for their strength and endurance. They originated in Germany as hunting and herding dogs. Due to their extreme athleticism and intelligence, today's German shepherds often serve as guide dogs for the blind or service dogs, search dogs, and military and police dogs. Their sweet, loving personalities make them excellent family dogs, too.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding (AKC)</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 60 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coarse, medium-length double coat that comes in a variety of colors, primarily golden, tan, black, and brindle</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 13 years</p><h2>Bulldog</h2><p>Don't let their shorter stature fool you. Bulldogs are extremely strong, powerful dogs due to their history as fighting dogs. In 13th century England, bulldogs were used in a horrific sport known as bull-baiting. During these matches, they would fight much larger, more powerful bulls. These fighting bulldogs had aggressive, fierce personalities-a far cry from today's sweet, calm bulldogs. When bull-baiting was banned, bulldog breeders softened their tough personalities, producing the gentle, loving companion dogs that we know today.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 14 to 15 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 40 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, fine, glossy coats that come in red, white, fawn, and fallow, among other color combinations and patterns</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Saint Bernard</h2><p>When you think of an image of a Saint Bernard, you probably imagine a big, hairy dog with a wooden cask of brandy strapped around its neck on a snow-topped mountain. This imagery accurately depicts how these dogs worked to rescue lost travelers in the snowy Swiss Alps. The breed originated over 1,000 years ago. It had a keen sense of smell and brute strength that has saved thousands of people from snowy terrain. Today, Saint Bernards are typically companion dogs and make excellent service dogs due to their loyalty, affection, and fierce protection of their people.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 25.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 130 to 180 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coats can be short and smooth or long and silky and come in white with red, brown, or brindle markings, with a black ""mask"" across the face</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><h2>Alaskan Malamute</h2><p>The Alaskan Malamute looks a lot like the much smaller Siberian husky; however, the indigenous people bred the two closely-related Arctic dogs for different needs. The sleeker Husky was bred more for its speed and endurance needed to pull sleds over long distances, while the Alaskan Malamute was developed for its sheer strength. Malamutes were sometimes used to pull sleds, and they also hunted polar bears, seals, and other powerful prey. It's commonly believed that Alaskan Malamutes are wolf-dog hybrids, but today's Malamutes are fully domesticated and make sweet, loving, and loyal companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches at the shoulder in males; 22 to 24 inches at the shoulder in females</p><p>Weight: 75 to 100 (or more) pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Thick, double coats that come in many color variations, primarily white with black, sable, brown, and gray</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Doberman Pinscher</h2><p>Doberman pinschers, otherwise known as Dobies, first originated in Germany in the early 1900s. Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann developed the breed and aimed to produce a medium-sized companion dog that could also work as a fierce guard dog. The Doberman is a muscular, athletic dog with high endurance and a good personality. The U.S. Marine Corps selected the Doberman as its official dog during World War II for its athleticism and endurance. They are still used as security, military, and police dogs today.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 65 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Short, sleek coats that come in red, blue, black, and fawn</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Rhodesian Ridgeback</h2><p>Known for the distinctive ""ridge"" along their backs, Rhodesian ridgebacks originated more than 500 years ago when European immigrants brought domesticated dog breeds to South Africa and bred them with a native, ridgebacked dog. This new crossbreed, the Rhodesian ridgeback, was trained to hunt large game, like lion and boar, in packs of four to six. Modern Rhodesians have retained their ancestors' strength and endurance and are now companion dogs to very active, athletic families or guard dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound (AKC)</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 70 to 85 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coats are short and smooth, coming in light wheaten to red wheaten colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 12 years</p><h2>Chow Chow</h2><p>Despite their fluffy, teddy bear appearance, Chow Chows are compact, mighty dogs with a long history as aggressive guard dogs. Their DNA dates back to 206 B.C.E. when they were temple guard dogs in China and other parts of Asia. It's mistakenly believed that modern-day Chow Chows have all retained their ancestors' aggressive behaviors; most are gentle, loving family dogs. They are sturdy and strong-willed but are fiercely loyal, and most still enjoy a game of chase.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting (AKC)</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 40 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat and Color: Coats can be rough or smooth and come in black, blue, red, and cream colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 9 to 13 years</p>",1263

And for people with disabilities, the services that dogs can provide aren't just useful they can be truly lifesaving.</p><p>There are at least 500,000 service dogs in the United States, according to Share America. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a service dog is defined as a dog that provides assistance to an individual with a disability. But the tasks they perform are as varied as the people who they help, with service dogs going through different types of training and providing different tasks depending on what their handler's needs are.</p><p>While they differ from working dogs, what all service dogs have in common is their legal right to enter all public spaces (extending beyond the rights of emotional support animals), as well as the fact that they are not ""pets,"" but dogs with very important jobs to do. So what are those jobs? Here are eight types of service dogs and the valuable roles that they play. </p><h2>Guide Dogs</h2><p>Guide dogs were perhaps the first iteration of service dogs as we know them today. In fact, the earliest recorded example of a guide dog goes back to the first century A.D., and active, standardized guide dog training can be traced back to the 1700s.</p><p>The role of a guide dog is to assist humans who are blind or otherwise visually impaired. This includes leading their handlers around obstacles, helping their handlers navigate in public, and assisting their handlers with going up and down stairs. One of the most unique traits of guide dogs is ""selective disobedience"" the ability to obey commands but also to make choices based on their own assessment of a situation.</p><p>You'll usually see guide dogs in a special harness that has a bar for their humans to hold on to for support. They often also wear vests that say ""Do not pet me,"" an important rule to follow since guide dogs should not be distracted when they are working. </p><h2>Hearing Dogs</h2><p>Just as guide dogs act as eyes for people who cannot see, hearing dogs act as ears for those who are deaf or hearing impaired. Hearing dogs are trained to alert their humans to important sounds, including doorbells and knocks on the door, as well as fire alarms, baby's cries, and alarm clocks.</p><p>Being deaf can be an incredibly isolating experience. By cuing deaf individuals in to the hearing world, hearing dogs help their humans stay connected to their environments and function with more independence. Based on the noise, hearing dogs will make physical contact with their handlers and then lead them either to the source or away from it. </p><h2>Seizure Alert Dogs</h2><p>One of dogs' more impressive traits is their ability to tune in to subtle changes in human behavior, a trait that can be a lifesaver for people with epilepsy. Seizure alert dogs are trained to recognize the often elusive signs that their handlers are about to have a seizure, and from there, they both alert for help and position themselves in such a way as to protect the individual during the seizure itself.</p><p>Interestingly, there's still no scientific understanding of seizure alert dogs recognize that a seizure is imminent, or even proof that dogs can be specifically trained to do so. Instead, research shows that some dogs seem to have innate seizure detection abilities, and anecdotally, there is plenty of ""proof"" that seizure alert dogs do their jobs quite well. </p><h2>Diabetic Alert Dogs</h2><p>Dogs have about 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses compared to the paltry six million that us humans have, which makes their sense of smell anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than our own. And with impressive smelling capabilities comes the ability to smell things we can't including chemical changes in blood sugar. For people with diabetes, this means they can be alerted to blood sugar drops before they reach dangerous levels, and that if they do experience a critical drop, others can be alerted. This provides diabetics with a sense of security and independence they may not have experienced before. </p><h2>Allergy Detection Dogs</h2><p> Steffen L./Pixabay</p><p>For children and adults with allergies, avoiding certain ingredients and substances can be a matter of life or death. Fortunately there are allergy detection dogs, who use their unmatchable sense of smell to detect traces of allergens in the air and foods and to alert their humans of the allergen's presence. Often, allergy detection dogs work with children, accompanying them to school and activities so that they have more independence and their parents have more peace of mind. </p><h2>Mobility Assistance Dogs</h2><p>Mobility assistance dogs perform invaluable tasks for people with impaired motor functions, in particular individuals who are in wheelchairs. They can do everything from pulling wheelchairs up ramps to pressing elevator buttons, and are often responsible for helping their handlers with many of the day-to-day actions that many of us take for granted.</p><p>In addition to assisting those who are in wheelchairs, mobility assistance dogs also work with individuals with arthritis, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injuries, among others. </p><h2>Autism Support Dogs</h2><p>While autism is not a physical disability, autism support dogs play an important role in maintaining the well-being of their handlers. Specific tasks include helping their handlers navigate social settings to build up their confidence, and they are also trained to keep track of autistic children who have a tendency to wander. Perhaps most importantly, autism support dogs provide companionship and judgment-free support to autistic individuals who may have a tough time connecting with other humans. For this reason, autism support dogs are useful for helping those with autism improve their communication skills and better regulate their emotions. </p><h2>Psychiatric Service Dogs</h2><p>Mental health disorders like post traumatic stress disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder can be immensely debilitating. People with these disorders may have a tough time taking care of themselves or leaving their home, and may experience regular panic attacks or intense feelings of discomfort in public settings. Psychiatric service dogs help provide a comforting barrier in times of distress, and can perform a range of tasks that include protecting their handler's personal space and turning on lights before their handler enters a room so that they feel safer.</p><p>It is important to note that psychiatric service dogs are not the same as emotional support dogs or therapy dogs. Though many of their tasks are emotionally-based, psychiatric service dogs go through extensive training and are not pets under the legal definition. </p><p>If you see a service dog when you are out in public, it is crucial that you remember it has a job to do and should never be distracted verbally or physically even if all you want to do is say ""hello."" Also remember that not all disabilities are clear and obvious. Someone with a service dog may seem perfectly capable, but their dogs are necessary for helping them avoid certain allergens or to alert them of oncoming seizures.</p><p>As humans learn to better understand dogs and their awe-inspiring capabilities, the list of service and working dog types is growing. And whether a dog is a trained service animal or just a pet, we can all agree: they're pretty amazing. </p>",1205
73,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-a-service-dog-1118678,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Working Dog Breeds,<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Service and Assistance Dogs</h1>,"<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Service and Assistance Dogs</h1><p>You have probably heard the terms service dog and assistance dog before, but do you know what these terms truly mean? Generally speaking, a service dog or assistance dog is a working dog specially trained to help a person or group of people with a disability or specific needs. However, there is a bit more to the definition of a service dog, especially in the eyes of the law. A service dog is a type of working dog but is very different from other working dogs like police dogs, cadaver dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs. </p><h2>How Does the Law Define a Service Dog?</h2><p>According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, ""service animals are defined as dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities."" The dog must not be a pet, but be specially trained to assist the handler with something directly related to his or her disability. Neither emotional support dogs nor therapy dogs are considered service animals in the eyes of the law.</p><p>The ADA also notes that their definition of a service dog ""does not affect or limit the broader definition of 'assistance animal' under the Fair Housing Act or the broader definition of 'service animal' under the Air Carrier Access Act.""</p><p>Under the ADA, service dogs cannot be denied entrance to businesses, even food service establishments, state and local government facilities or nonprofit organizations that serve the public. However, service dogs must be under control at all times. This generally means they should be leashed or harnessed unless these get in the way of the dog's duties, in which case the dog must still be under the handler's control. </p><p>The ADA mandates that a disabled person cannot be asked questions about his or her disability.</p><p>Handlers of service dogs cannot be charged more money because of their dogs, nor can they be denied the rights and access granted to those without service animals. Disabled persons with service dogs can only be asked to leave the premises if the dog is out of control and it cannot be corrected by the handler, or if the dog is not house trained.</p><h2>Types of Service Dogs</h2><p>There are many types of service dogs, and some even serve multiple purposes. Potential service dogs go through rigorous training programs before they can team up with a handler.</p><h2>How to Spot a Service Dog</h2><p>Most of the time, service dogs can be easily identified. Many wear special vests and/or harnesses and pay close attention to their handlers. However, special identification is not actually required. Never assume that a dog is or is not a service animal. Always be sure to ask before petting a dog even if the dog is a pet, this is essential to prevent bites. Service dogs should not be petted, fed, or otherwise given attention while at work. Please be respectful and allow these dogs to do their jobs. They make a major difference in the lives of disabled persons.</p><p>There are no specific rules about what a service dog should or should not wear. They do not need to be identified with special harnesses or vests.</p><h2>Requirements for Getting a Service Dog</h2><p>Have you ever seen a service dog with its handler and wished you could take your dog everywhere with you too? You're not alone. However, wanting this and needing this are two different things. Too many people are trying to pass their dogs off as service animals, and they are ruining it for the people who truly need service animals.</p><p>People with service dogs rely upon their dogs to let them live their lives more as the average person can do without a dog. The ADA rules are intended to ensure that no disabled person is interrogated or made to feel inferior. This is an important rule. However, it also makes it easy for selfish people to take advantage of the law and try to pass off their pet dogs as real service animals. Most states have no laws against this, and even if they did, it would be difficult to prove you are not faking. However, the simple truth is this: it is unethical and immoral to pretend your dog is a true service dog.</p><p>In most cases, service dogs are trained from puppyhood by specialized programs. However, there are exceptions where people have been surprised to find that the loyal family dog has a natural talent, such as the ability to detect low blood sugar and wake up a sleeping diabetic and save a life. Even then, the dog should be trained to clearly alert their handler to low blood sugar. Then, the dog will have to be trained to behave properly in public so that the pet can be called a legitimate service dog.</p><h2>The Problem With Service Dog Impersonators</h2><p>Putting a vest on your pet dog does not make them a service animal. There are plenty of online service dog registries that will gladly take your money and issue a certificate. That does not make your dog a true service animal. If you do not have a disability but try to make your pet dog into a so-called service dog to get them on a plane with you, into a restaurant, or into some other public place, you will only add to the mistrust business owners sometimes have towards service animals.</p><p>Unfortunately, many phony service dogs behave poorly in public, most likely because they have not gone through rigorous training programs. Fake service dogs may cause damage to property, harass other customers, or create general chaos. This unruly behavior could potentially harm the business, making proprietors suspicious of future service dogs. It also makes legitimate service dogs and their handlers look bad.</p><p>Even if your dog is well-behaved, passing off your dog as a service animal is just plain wrong. Doing so is only going to make it more difficult for truly disabled persons to have the service dogs that they honestly need.</p>",963

Indeed, they make excellent working dogs, as they were bred originally to help the Chukchi people of Siberia hunt more efficiently. But they're sweet, friendly, and loyal cuddle bugs, too.</p><p>From their distinctive, wolf-like appearance, bright blue eyes, and fascinating history, there's a lot to learn and love! about Siberian huskies. Whether you're already a husky parent or considering adding a husky to the family, you'll want to check out these facts about the world's most amazing sled dogs. And let's not forget about the cute pictures, too.</p><h2>Huskies Originated in Siberia</h2><p>knoxandnuka / Instagram</p><p>As their name implies, Siberian huskies originated in yep, you guessed it Siberia. </p><p>About 3,000 years ago, the Chukchi people, a semi-nomadic tribe in Siberia, wanted to expand their hunting grounds but needed a little help pulling their sleds over such long distances. So, they set out to breed the ideal sled dog one that required some serious endurance, a thick, winter-ready coat to protect them from subzero temperatures, and the ability to survive on minimal food. </p><p>The result? The Chukchi dog, a distant relative to today's modern huskies. </p><h2>Huskies Have Built-In Winter Wear</h2><p>siberianhuskyheart / Instagram</p><p>Because they originated in subzero climates, Siberian huskies are always ready for severe winter weather. They have a double coat, comprised of a very thick, short undercoat that helps them retain body heat, and a long outer coat that's water-resistant, while their almond-shaped eyes offer protection from loose snow and strong sunlight reflecting off of snow. What's more? Their long, bushy tails can be wrapped around their faces for extra warmth while they sleep. </p><h2>Huskies Have a Lot of Energy and Make Great Jogging Buddies</h2><p>waigeyyy / Instagram</p><p>If you're adding a high-energy husky to the family, be prepared to exercise your dog . According to the American Kennel Club, Siberian huskies need regular exercise. How you achieve that is up to you and the doggo whether you choose to walk, swim, run, play, or even sled. </p><p>Huskies were bred to run, so unsurprisingly, they make excellent jogging buddies. Just be sure to build up your husky's mileage slowly. It shouldn't run a 5k straight out of the gate, and only exercise outdoors on cool days with low humidity. Huskies' super dense coats may make them less tolerant of activity in the heat. If you live in a warm climate or want to exercise your husky during the summer months, stick to water activities, like swimming or playing in the sprinkler. </p><h2>Many Huskies Have Blue Eyes</h2><p>atlas_the_husky_pup / Instagram</p><p>Blue eyes are pretty rare in most dog breeds (unless the doggy in question has the merle gene, which prevents pigment from fully developing in the eyes and coat), but many huskies are born with bright, blue peepers. Heterochromia or eyes of two different colors is also fairly common among huskies, and often results in blue, gold, brown, or orangey-colored eyes. </p><h2>Huskies Have Super-Friendly Personalities</h2><p>elkereichard / Instagram</p><p>Despite their tough, wolf-like appearances, Siberian huskies are incredibly friendly sometimes to a fault! Anyone looking for a husky guard dog will be sorely disappointed, because huskies are simply too friendly and too trusting of strangers. The upside to this charming character trait? They make amazing furry family members.</p><p>So, if you live in a cooler climate, have a big backyard (a pup's gotta get his energy out somewhere), and have kids, a husky might be the perfect pick for your family. </p><h2>Huskies Have Incredible Metabolisms</h2><p>atlasandrowan / Instagram</p><p>Here's a fact about huskies science can't even explain: huskies can sprint for hours upon hours, without food, and without fully depleting their bodies' glycogen (carbohydrates) or fat stores. How do they burn so many calories without using all of their reserves? They must regulate their metabolism for performance. </p><p>Keep in mind: If we humans attempted to run for hours without any source of energy, we'd fatigue pretty quickly and have to stop. </p><p>Huskies were bred to run for long distances with minimal food supplies, so it makes sense that their bodies have evolved to perform with hardly any fatigue. But it's still pretty amazing, right?</p><h2>Huskies Can Have Colorful Coats</h2><p>fernxlobo / Instagram</p><p>We often think of thick gray and white or black and white coats when we think of Siberian huskies, but the colors of their coats can vary greatly. According to the American Kennel Club, huskies' coats can be one of six colors black, agouti, gray, red, sable, and white but there are tons of variations out there. </p><h2>Huskies Are Very Talkative</h2><p>obilehusky / Instagram</p><p>If you have a husky, you know they are very talkative. They're known for their jabbering, groaning, and grumbling. But did you know a husky's howl can be heard from away? Talk about chatty, huh?</p><p>Female huskies grow to weigh 35 to 50 pounds; male huskies, 44 to 60.</p><p>Siberian huskies live from 12 to 15 years.</p><p>Your husky needs to be groomed on a regular basis; at least weekly, with a wide-toothed comb or paddle brush. (We recommend doing this task outside, where it won't fill your home with excess fur.)</p><p>Siberian Husky.</p>",822
84,https://www.thesprucepets.com/search-and-rescue-dogs-5190901,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Working Dog Breeds,<h1>All About Search and Rescue Dogs</h1>,"<h1>All About Search and Rescue Dogs</h1><p><p>Although they're often portrayed on TV and in the movies, it can be hard to fully appreciate just how brave, courageous, and heroic a search and rescue (or SAR) dog can be. Search and rescue dogs are disciplined, life-saving canines that are sharply trained to spring into action in the case of a crisis situation, whether it's identifying human remains, finding a missing child, or seeking out evidence to help solve a crime. Along with their highly-trained handlers, SAR dogs are working dogs that are prepared to assist in emergencies in any environment, from the wilderness to the city.</p><p>While all dogs have earned their title of ""man's best friend"" for good reason, the search and rescue canine takes it to a whole new level: the finely-tuned skills of search and rescue (SAR) dogs can often mean the difference between life and death, especially during mass casualty events, natural disasters, and when searching for missing persons.</p><h2>History of Search and Rescue Dogs</h2><p>Rescue dogs are credited with saving thousands of lives every year. Though there are many dogs that can be trained in search and rescue, generally breeds like the German Shepherd, Border Collie, Belgian Malinois, and Labrador Retrievers are chosen and they may begin their training as early as 8 to 10 weeks of age.</p><p>There are many documented instances of search and rescue dogs throughout history; in World War II, for example, they were used to help search for people buried in the ruins of houses after air raids. In many other countries, both search and rescue and service dogs were being trained as early as the 1920s, any many regions saw a resurgence in SAR training in the 1950s. Among the earliest documentation of search and rescue was in the early 1800s, within the Great Saint Bernard Pass in Switzerland.</p><p>After an earthquake in Armenia in 1988, a global team of search and rescue dogs was formed; the (IRO) began to assist with these trained teams.</p><h2>Qualities of a SAR Dogs</h2><p>Since dogs experience the world through some 200 million scent receptors in their noses (for comparison's sake, humans only have 5 million), they can detect the most subtle scent, even if it's one from several years ago.</p><p>That's why search and rescue dogs are specifically trained to use their noses to assist in an emergency, such as locating a missing person or uncovering clues from a crime. These dogs can follow trails that are months, or even years old, as well as detect a scent from a piece of clothing that hasn't been worn in a decade. Some rescue dogs are trained to detect scents in the air, while others are known as trailing dogs because they can follow scents on the ground.</p><p>But, of course, a dog needs more than their nose to become a SAR dog. These canines have to meet several rigorous qualifications, such as being resilient, strong, and agile dogs that are powerful enough to hold or drag objects including humans when necessary. Additionally, SAR dogs must be very well socialized with both people and other animals, and they have to be able to withstand stressful situations, like loud noises (explosions) and overwhelming crowds of people or other animals.</p><p>While larger breeds are generally preferred when training SAR dogs, they cannot be so large that their size would pose challenges during the rescue task at hand. St. Bernards are known to be able to smell up to 15 feet under snow, but they aren't an ideal choice for training because of their massive size. On the other hands, breeds like the Newfoundland are often trained in search and rescue because they aren't quite as large but still have the strength to swim while a human is attached to its harness.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, SAR dogs have to be laser-focused and exceptionally motivated to continue with the task at hand during even the most time-consuming searches. And they have to be able to do so even the most unfavorable conditions. Generally speaking, that's why breeds with a highly developed prey drive are preferred these dogs won't give up until they've received their reward.</p><h2>How SAR Dogs are Trained</h2><p>Once a dog is old enough to undergo training, becoming an SAR dog will require several years of daily lessons. These dogs are first trained in basic obedience (they must master classic commands such as sit and come, stay, and heel), primarily through the use of hand signals since verbal communication may not always be possible during a rescue situation.</p><p>SAR dogs then undergo rigorous agility training, so that they were fully prepared to navigate treacherous terrain. They have to be able to balance themselves while walking on beams or other unstable footing, as well as to jump through windows and perform other highly athletic, and often dangerous, physical feats.</p><p>They will then continue their training with more specialized searching and tracking lessons, which will increase in difficulty and intensity as the dog gains both skills and confidence. These types of sessions might also include retrieving, such as finding a piece of evidence or a tool that when provided to its handler could save someone's life.</p>",844
87,https://www.thesprucepets.com/wild-facts-about-wolf-dogs-4684123,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Working Dog Breeds,<h1>9 Wild Facts About Wolf Dogs</h1>,"<h1>9 Wild Facts About Wolf Dogs</h1><p>From classic literature (we're looking at you, ), to and famous Instagram animals, it seems like wolf dogs are everywhere these days, and for good reason! These somewhat wild canines aren't just beautiful they're super intriguing and mysterious, too.</p><p>Beauty and mystery aside, there's a lot of controversy surrounding wolf dogs and debate about whether or not they're safe pets for families. If you're considering adding a wolf dog to the pack, read on for some vital facts about wolf dogs, their behaviors, and their legality.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs, Defined</h2><p>What, exactly, is a wolf dog, you ask? Like the name implies, a wolf dog is a hybrid of a wolf and a domesticated dog Siberian Huskies, Malamutes, and German Shepherds are the most commonly crossed domesticated breeds. Both wolves and domesticated dogs are ""interfertile,"" meaning they're genetically similar enough to interbreed, but these hybrid pooches rarely occur in nature because wolves are super aggressive and territorial.</p><p>And, yes, it's true that dogs have some wolf in their ancestry, but an animal can only be considered a true wolf dog if they have a pure wolf ancestor within the last five generations.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs Are a Little Controversial</h2><p>sorenwolf/Flickr</p><p>Like many other dogs that are considered ""dangerous,"" there's some controversy around wolf dogs and whether or not they make good pets.</p><p>While some say they're loyal, loving, and totally trainable animals, others claim they're too wild, aggressive and unpredictable. The truth is, there's no ""typical"" wolf dog and no way to predict how ""wolf-like"" it will be. Accordingly, there's much more variety in behavior and temperament than, say, a Golden Retriever, which may be tough for pet parents who aren't able to raise a wolf dog with an unpredictable temperament and wolf-like needs. Sadly, many of these animals end up living in cages, or euthanized because owners were not prepared to care for them properly.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs Can't Be Vaccinated for Rabies</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn't an approved rabies vaccine for wolf dogs, so any wolf dog that bites a person or another pet can be considered a Rabies risk.</p><p>Wolf dog owners are encouraged to vaccinate their pets since the vaccine will still be protective in most cases, however, these animals cannot be considered legally vaccinated as they are not included in the vaccine manufacturers' labeled use. That means that if a wolf dog bites a person or pet, they would be considered a Rabies risk and could be euthanized for Rabies testing depending on the situation.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs Aren't Legal in All 50 States</h2><p>Wolf dogs are usually classified by their filial number, or the generations removed from a pure wolf. F1, for example, represents the original breeding between a wolf and a domesticated dog, or a wolf and wolf dog, while F2 represents the second generation. Because DNA sequencing is not usually performed or provided to potential owners, it can be tricky to determine whether or not your dog is a true wolf dog or a standard, domesticated dog that has been bred to have a wolf-like appearance.</p><p>This blurriness makes it extremely hard for states to establish legislation around wolf dogs being kept as pets and many have made it out-right illegal, while others allow restricted ownership.</p><p>If you're considering adding a wolf dog to the family, do your research to ensure owning a wolf dog is legal in your state.</p><h2>Wolf Dog Pups Can Look and Behave Totally Different Than the Rest of the Litter</h2><p>ragnar_and_floki_wolves / Instagram </p><p>Although many litters of domesticated doggies share several physical and behavioral traits, wolf dog pups can look and act unlike any of their brothers and sisters. Why? Some pups in the litter may take on more characteristics of the domesticated dog, while others could take on more characteristics of the wild wolf. Like we said, there's no true way to predict your wolf dog's degree of wolf-ness as she grows into an adolescent and adult.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs Need a Ton of Space</h2><p>syrahandodin / Instagram </p><p>Wolf dogs are usually recommended for people who live in the wilderness or woods because they need a of space to remain happy, healthy, and exercised. Some resources recommend an area of at least 65x65 square feet with plenty of trees and obstacles for the wolf dog to climb.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs Need a Special Diet</h2><p>betty_the_wolfqueen / Instagram</p><p>Nope, the standard kibble you feed your other dogs won't do it for a wolf dog. They need two to four pounds of raw meat daily. Feeding your wolf dog regular dog food won't provide him with the nutrients he really needs.</p><h2>Wolf Dogs Howl A Lot</h2><p>hippie_saaloos / Instagram</p><p>There are countless reasons why wolf dogs howl, from communicating with another wolf dog (or wolf!), to telling another dog to stay off her turf, to hearing a siren in the distance. If you bring a wolf dog home, be prepared for of howling.</p><p>Why The Rabies Vaccine Should be Approved For Wolfdogs.</p>",795

The breed is still used in this capacity today, though the most important job of many Great Pyrenees is that of a beloved family companion. With family, Great Pyrenees are exceptionally devoted and protective, something that extends to both humans and other animals in the family ""pack"". </p><h3>What is a Great Pyrenees dog?</h3><p>The Great Pyrenees is a massive, white dog that is large and powerful, likely dating back to the 18th century B.C. The Great Pyrenees is an adorable gentle giant, intelligent, loyal to its family, and great with children.</p><p>Read on to learn more interesting facts about the Great Pyrenees. </p><h2>The Great Pyrenees Is Named After a Mountain</h2><p>The breed takes its name from the Pyrenees Mountains, a vast range that lies between France and Spain. In these mountains, Great Pyrenees have assisted shepherds as flock guardians for millennia.</p><h2>The Great Pyrenees Has More Than One Name</h2><p>The breed is only known as the Great Pyrenees in the United States. In the United Kingdom and Europe, the Great Pyrenees is called the Pyrenean Mountain Dog, and in France, the breeds is alternatively called Le Chien de Montagne des Pyrenees or Le Chien des Pyrenees.</p><h2>Great Pyrenees Puppies Grow Quickly</h2><p>A newborn Great Pyrenees puppy weighs just 1 to 2 pounds, but by 3 months of age Great Pyrenees pups weigh 30 to 40 pounds. At maturity, Great Pyrenees males weigh about 100 pounds; females are about 80 pounds.</p><h2>The Great Pyrenees Is Around the Same Size as a Wolf</h2><p>Part of the Great Pyrenees's job was to fend off wild animals that wanted to make a meal of the sheep. To help in this capacity, the Great Pyrenees is approximately the same size as the European grey wolf (Eurasian wolf), a common predator the dogs encountered while guarding their flocks. </p><h2>Great Pyrenees Are Not Always Pure White</h2><p>Although the body is primarily white (ranging from bright white to cream), some Great Pyrenees have gray, reddish brown, or tan markings on the ears, head, tail, and body (a few spots only). Darker markings might fade as puppies mature.</p><h2>The Great Pyrenees is an Ancient Breed</h2><p>Breed historians believe that the Great Pyrenees can trace its roots back to a group of mostly white mountain flock guardian dogs that lived in Asia Minor 11,000 years ago. These large, white dogs may have come to the Pyrenees Mountains around 3,000 BC, where they evolved into the Great Pyrenees we know today.</p><h2>The Great Pyrenees Has Its Own National Club</h2><p>The Great Pyrenees Club of America was recognized in 1935 by the American Kennel Club as the parent club for the Great Pyrenees. Each AKC-recognized breed has only one national parent club, which represents the breed in the United States.</p><p>The Great Pyrenees Club of America is a nonprofit organization that offers breed education, sanctions breed competitions and events, facilitates breed rescue, and maintains the breed standard, which is the written description of the ideal Great Pyrenees.</p><h2>Great Pyrenees Can Be Devoted Family Members</h2><p>Great Pyrenees have a natural affinity for animals and children, watching over them and keeping them safe from harm. The breed's calm demeanor and patient temperament makes them excellent family dogs. </p><h2>Great Pyrenees Are Naturally Protective</h2><p>The breed is territorial, has a strong instinct to guard and protect the family and the home, and is naturally wary of strangers. Early socialization and training are important to help the Great Pyrenees learn to be accepting of friendly visitors. </p><h2>Great Pyrenees Don't Need as Much Exercise as You Might Expect</h2><p>Though massive, the Great Pyrenees does not demand hours of exercise a day. Much of the working Great Pyrenees's day was spent sitting or lying with the flock, ever alert for approaching danger. Aim for moderate daily exercise, including leashed walks and off-leash exploring in a safely enclosed yard.</p><h2>Great Pyrenees Can Have Nocturnal Habits</h2><p>Many Great Pyrenees owners report that their dogs like to ""patrol"" at night, keeping an eye on the home and family. The Great Pyrenees is also known to bark a lot (especially at night) to alert you to anything suspicious. Many Great Pyrenees owners keep their dogs inside at night to avoid upsetting their neighbors.</p><p>At least 4 feet high, often more. (If you're getting a fence, make it taller than 6 feet.)</p><p>It really depends on the personality of your Great Pyrenees. Shepherds, Collies, Huskies, and Malamutes are all good choices, along with Sheepdogs and Beagles.</p><p>Great Pyrenees live about 10 to 12 years.</p>",744
96,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-register-an-emotional-support-animal-4685221,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Working Dog Breeds,<h1>How to Register an Emotional Support Animal</h1>,"<h1>How to Register an Emotional Support Animal</h1><p>An emotional support animal can be a true lifesaver for someone dealing with mental health problems. From offering companionship and the stability of a routine to serving as a trusted guide through anxiety-inducing social situations, emotional support animals offer invaluable support in addition to the non-judgmental, unconditional love that animals already provide so freely.</p><p>All that being said, emotional support animals a term that is often shortened to just ""ESAs"" aren't pets, at least by the standard definition of the term. They're not service animals or therapy animals, either. Instead, ESAs have unique legal allowances that are specific to their designation. In order to enjoy not just the benefits of an emotional support animal but the legal rights as well, individuals have to register their ESAs. And it's a process that isn't always obvious to everyone.</p><h2>Difference Between an ESA and a Service/Therapy Animal</h2><p>While considering to register an emotional support animal, it helps to understand what makes ESAs different from other types of ""specialty"" animals, most notably service and therapy animals, of which they are many unique subtypes.</p><p>In their most basic definition, ESAs are animals who provide their caregivers with therapeutic benefits. Unlike a psychiatric service dog, who may, for example, turn on the lights before their handler enters a room to help them deal with phobias or symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, an ESA supports their human through love and companionship.</p><p>As anyone who has ever shared their life with a pet knows, animals are uniquely suited to connecting with humans on a deep level. A beloved animal companion may be the first one an individual goes to when they need someone to cry to or someone who can listen without judgment. This comes without the training that a service or therapy animal must go through.</p><p>Though they provide incredibly important services, emotional support animals are considered to be somewhere in between the realms of service or therapy animals and standard pets. So while they may not get a wide range of legal rights, they do get some. And that's where registration comes in.</p><h2>Emotional Support Animals Rights</h2><p>The rights of emotional support animals are relegated to two key areas: travel and housing. Emotional support animals are permitted to travel by plane without the use of a carrier or added fee and may serve as a basis to circumvent no-pet policies in rental units.</p><p>Because of these allowances, you may have noticed some debate over the validity of ESAs, particularly when it comes to air travel. But as it stands today, emotional support animals and their handlers do have certain legal rights above and beyond those of typical pets and their caregivers. And for the individuals who rely on their ESAs for support, these rights are invaluable. </p><h2>How to Register an ESA</h2><p>There is no official registration database for emotional support animals. Instead, any requested allowances for an ESA must be bolstered with a letter from a certified mental health professional.</p><p>If you don't already have a mental health provider, you have two options: You can either make an appointment with one and get your letter that way, or you can use an online ESA letter service, such as Emotional Pet Support, ESA Doctors, or CertaPet. Note that these services do cost money, and you will be required to complete a mental health evaluation before receiving your letter.</p><p>Once you have certified your ESA, be sure to keep your letter readily available, as it may be requested when you go fly with your animal or when you are looking for housing. Under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), landlords cannot discriminate against tenants who use an animal for assistance, including for emotional support, but they can if you don't have the letter. While it is not required, you could also purchase a vest for your animal that designates them as an ESA.</p><p>For more on emotional support animals, check out our list of the 10 best emotional support dog breeds.</p><p>There are many laws about where you can take a service dog, but that does not carry over to emotional support dogs: airlines are no longer required to carry them in the passenger cabin, they are not allowed in restaurants, movie theaters, or shopping venues.</p><p>While emotional support dogs do not legally need any specific training, it's important that they remain calm, well-behaved, and housebroken.</p><p>As much as it costs to train any dog in your area; emotional support dogs have no specific training other than to behave.</p>",737

If you're planning to bring your furry companion back home with you this holiday season, there are a few things you'll want to consider. </p><p>Most notably, several travel restrictions have gone into place within the last year regarding Emotional Support Animals, meaning that what worked for you last year might no longer be the case.</p><p>Many airlines, bus lines, and train lines no longer allow ESAs to travel without charge and without a carrier. In addition, many organizations have different rules for ESAs and Psychiatric Service Dogs. While both ESAs and PSDs provide assistance to individuals with disabilities, PSDs are dogs that have undergone training to perform specific tasks to assist their owner, such as putting a paw on the owner's chest to ease anxiety or reminding them to take medication.</p><p>The best way to prepare for traveling with your pet this holiday season is to plan ahead. Regardless of whether your pet has a certification, many transportation providers have strict, specific regulations, so you could find yourself in a predicament if you do not thoroughly do your research in advance.</p><h2>What You Need to Know About Airlines' ESA Restrictions</h2><p>In early 2021, the Department of Transportation (DOT) revised its rules regarding air travel with ESAs. These animals are no longer considered service animals under the Air Carrier Access Act, so it is up to airlines whether they allow them to fly in the airplane cabin. </p><p>Shortly after the Department of Transportation announcement, most major domestic airlines, including Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue, United, Southwest, and Spirit, announced they would no longer accept ESAs without charge and without a carrier. ESAs are still allowed on several international airlines.</p><p>All airlines remain required to accept animals that are ""trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability,"" according to the DOT. This includes PSDs.</p><p>While ESAs are banned from flying without charge on several airlines, there are ways to fly with your pet for a fee, as long as they meet the airline's requirements. Many airlines allow small animals to fly as ""carry-ons"" for a fee; however there is often a limit on how many pets can fly per flight. In addition, certain airlines allow large pets to fly as cargo.</p><h2>What You Should Know About Car Travel With Your ESA</h2><p>When traveling by car with an ESA, or any pet, it is important to plan out seating arrangements and pitstops. </p><p>You might want to consider transporting your pet safely with a harness or crate, especially since some states require it by law, including Minnesota, Maine, and several other states in the Northeast. Other states have laws prohibiting dogs from front seats and truck beds. Research the laws in the states along your route to ensure you're obeying the appropriate regulations. </p><p>It's also important to research any hotels or restaurants you plan to visit along the way. Hotels and restaurants are not legally required to allow ESAs so it can be beneficial to research pet policies ahead of time.</p><h2>What You Should Know About Train or Bus Travel With Your ESA</h2><p>When traveling by bus or train, several major companies, such as Amtrak and Greyhound, have mirrored airlines in restricting ESAs.</p><p>Amtrak allows service dogs, including PSDs, in all areas of the train that passengers are allowed, provided that they stay seated on the floor and remain under control. For a $26 fee, Amtrak allows non-service cats and dogs under 20 pounds in a pet carrier.</p><p>If you do plan to bring a pet on a train or any other transportation provider it can be helpful to inform the provider ahead of time to avoid last-minute complications.</p><p>Greyhound also allows trained service animals to travel with passengers. However, those are the only animals allowed on Greyhound buses. All other pets, including ESAs, are prohibited.</p><p>Changing definitions of ""service animals"" has made traveling with ESAs more complicated in the last year, but with the appropriate preparation, you can still enjoy the holidays with your pet.</p><p>Travel With Service Animals.</p><p>Service Animals. .</p><p>Trained Service Animals. .</p><p>Trained Service Animals.

Some people cannot live independently without the services of people and specially trained pets. Others simply benefit from a visit with an animal that provides them with a sense of calm and relaxation. Therapy animals provide this special service to people.</p><p>Not to be confused with a service dog or an emotional support pet, therapy animals are socialized and trained to provide comfort and affection to people in various stressful environments. Therapy animals are most commonly seen in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and disaster areas, and are classified as one of three types: therapeutic visitation animals, animal-assisted therapy animals, and facility therapy animals.</p><p>The most common kind of therapy animal is a therapeutic visitation animal. These are often pets that go to various places, such as detention facilities, to visit with people who may miss their own pets, but return home with their owner at the end of the day. All kinds of animals are utilized as therapy animals but regardless of the species, they typically go through a veterinarian's assessment, have received basic training, and have been screened to ensure they do well with people. Therapy animals are not protected by any federal laws, but some states have their own laws to grant rights to the owners and their pets.

Studies have shown that dogs help calm and relax people, and therapy dogs are a testament to this. Larger breeds, such as Labradors and Golden Retrievers, are most often seen as therapy dogs, but that doesn't mean other breeds can't make a good therapy animal. As long as a dog is friendly towards people and knows basic obedience commands, it could probably become a therapy animal!</p><h2>Therapy Horses</h2><p>Horses, while much larger than dogs, make excellent therapy animals. You won't see a horse walking through a school (unless it's a miniature horse) but you will often seen equine-assisted therapy techniques utilizing therapy horses. Therapy horses are great animals to aid in mental health and are also used in equine-facilitated psychotherapy by addiction treatment centers, veterans groups, and other mental wellness facilities that are overseen by medical professionals.</p><p>Grooming a horse is often touted as being very therapeutic and the human emotions a horse mimics have been shown to be very beneficial for people battling many different types of psychological issues. Horses also help teach people a variety of things, such as trust building and work ethic, in addition to dealing with emotions.</p><p>Therapy horses may or may not be ridden.</p><h2>Therapy Cats</h2><p>A less obvious choice than dogs or horses, many cats can make great therapy animals. Just like dogs, cats are easy to bring into indoor facilities such as nursing homes and hospitals to aid in comforting anyone who may be missing their own pets. Many therapy cats learn to walk on a leash and can have a very calming presence for children in school, elderly in assisted living facilities, and other situations. They are also a great indoor therapy animal option for people who may have a fear of dogs.</p><h2>Therapy Rabbits</h2><p>Sometimes a small, quiet therapy animal is needed, and when this is the case, a rabbit makes a wonderful therapy animal. Rabbits are easy to transport, do not bark or meow, and are excellent options for people who may be frightened of both dogs and cats, since a fear of rabbits is not very common.</p><p>A therapy rabbit needs to be calm, well-socialized, and enjoy being handled and petted by people. It is ideal if a therapy rabbit is also litter box trained. Not all rabbits fit this bill, but if a friendly rabbit is comfortable in a harness and four-foot leash, they might make a great therapy animal.</p>",710
