The good news is that most dogs would be more than happy to enjoy an adventure in the wilderness with you.</p><p>But, of course, there are some things to consider before you pack up the car and head to your campsite if you plan to bring your four-legged friend. Here are some ideas to make your camping trip safe (and fun!) with Fido in tow.</p><h2>1. Plan Ahead</h2><p>When planning a camping trip for you and your four-legged buddy, you'll want to be sure to check off a few important boxes on the to-do list before you hit the road. For starters, you'll want to reserve your campsite early (particularly during peak travel or vacation times) and double check the pet policies and any rules that apply to canine visitors. You should also plan a travel route that incorporates opportunities to pull over and allow your dog to use relieve himself and get a little exercise.</p><h2>2. Invest in the Right Gear</h2><p>Most avid campers will tell you that the right gear can make all the difference, and the same rule applies to your canine companion. If you haven't already, you may want to invest in high-quality gear for your dog that can help ensure a successful camping trip, whether it's a sturdy and properly-fitted harness or a set of durable food and water bowls.</p><h2>3. Make Sure Your Dog Has ID</h2><p>Much like any other time you leave your home&mdash;especially for an extended period of time like a trip or vacation&mdash;you should always be sure your dog's collar tag and microchip registration are up-to-date. While most dogs love the outdoors, it can be all too easy for them to get overwhelmed with all the sights and smells of the woods and wander off to explore or take chase after a squirrel or rabbit.</p><h2>4. Visit the Vet</h2><p>Speaking of your veterinarian, it's always a good idea to schedule an appointment before you embark on any sort of trip with your dog. You'll want to be sure your dog is up-to-date on vaccinations (especially if the campground is requiring them for entry) as well as ensure that your pup isn't dealing with any potential health issues that could make it unsafe for them to go camping. Your vet can also trim your dog's nails to help prevent them from getting caught on anything outdoors.</p><h2>5. Don't Forget the Food</h2><p>It can be tempting to share that yummy campfire food with your pup (especially as he or she stares at you with longing eyes), but you'll want to try to keep your dog's diet as normal as possible during your trip in order to prevent stomach upset like diarrhea or vomiting&mdash;not to mention more dangerous conditions like pancreatitis. A plain piece of cooked chicken or fish with no added salt or other spices is probably fine, but fatty trimmings and any other oily food can be harmful to your dog.</p><p>It's also extremely important to be sure your dog has access to fresh, clean water at all times and a shaded area to rest&mdash;particularly if you're camping in the summer months&mdash;to prevent heat stroke. And if you think you can just rely on a pond or stream to give your dog a refreshing drink, think again. The water may contain algae and/or parasites that can be harmful to dogs.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Be extra careful with corn cobs and other camping favorites like s'mores, as consuming these can actually be fatal for dogs&mdash;corn cobs can cause life-threatening intestinal blockages, while the chocolate in everyone's favorite campfire dessert is toxic to canines.</p><h2>6. Bring Emergency Supplies</h2><p>If you're an avid camper, your backpack probably already contains some basic first aid supplies, from bandages for cuts and scrapes to moleskin for blistered feet. But when bringing your pooch camping, you'll also want to prepare for any emergencies that may be specific to canines.</p><p>For example, if your dog is already on medication, you'll want to be sure you bring that with you. And if you have a breed that's a particularly active and high-energy, you may also want to consider supplies such as gauze, rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, or surgical tape in case of any physical injuries. Other potential emergency items might include antibiotic ointment, vet wrap, or foot balm to help protect their paws.</p><h2>7. Know How to Remain Calm</h2><p>You can pack all of the first aid supplies you could ever possibly need, but if you don't know how to remain calm and react in an emergency situation&mdash;and actually use those supplies appropriately&mdash;then they aren't going to be particularly useful. If your dog has been injured, it's going to be crucial to remain as level-headed as possible and address the situation immediately, whether it's an animal bite or your pup is exhibiting symptoms of heat stroke. Dogs are very intuitive and will be able to sense if you're panicking, which will make them more likely to act out.</p><p>If you feel your emergency response skills could use some improvement, be sure to check local outdoor supply stores to see if they're offering wilderness first aid classes. Organizations like the Red Cross&mdash;and even some community colleges&mdash;also offer courses that are specific to teaching first aid for your dog.</p><h2>8. Watch Out for Wildlife</h2><p>When you go on a camping trip, encountering various critters in the woods is par for the course. But you don't necessarily want your pup coming nose-to-nose with a porcupine or skunk, and you definitely want to avoid a run-in with a larger, more dangerous animal like a bear, wolf, or poisonous snake. Even if your dog has free rein on your own property, you should pack that long leash and keep them close to prevent any tangles with wild animals.</p><h2>9. Stay Close</h2><p>In addition to a long leash, keep in mind that your pet should really never be out of your sight while camping (or during travel in general). Your dog may be the life of the party at home but could experience a complete behavior change and become skittish, withdrawn, or even aggressive when exposed to a new environment, so never make assumptions as to how your dog will behave around other people or animals. For their safety, it's best to keep your dog close at all times, including at the campsite as well as in the car and during any outdoor activities.</p><h2>10. Pack the Extra Blankets</h2><p>While it's easy for humans to quickly dry off after a dip in the lake, if your four-legged friend is a swimming enthusiast, you'll want to be sure to have plenty of extra towels and blankets on hand to dry them off (and keep them warm as the temperature drops in the evening hours). Towels and rags can also be used in emergency situations, and they can certainly come in handy in case of an unexpected downpour.</p><p>It's also a good idea to take a dog life jacket, especially if you plan on taking your dog canoeing or kayaking out onto a body of water. Your dog may be good to swim in a pool, but with a large body of water, new experiences in that environment, and the possibility to no nearby shore, they would be safer wearing a flotation device.</p>",1221
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/the-cost-of-dog-ownership-1117321,Dogs > Getting Started,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>Costs of Owning a Dog</h1>,"<h1>Costs of Owning a Dog</h1><p>How much does it cost to own a dog and care for it properly? You may have heard that dogs are expensive. While it's true that there is an investment involved with dog care, it's best to understand the details of dog care expenses. The are one-time expenses, monthly expenses, and annual expenses to consider. With something like the cost of dog care, it's all relative.</p><p>The cost of owning a dog is about more than just the expense of food. Unfortunately, many people do not take the time to budget for a dog before getting one, leading to trouble down the road. Can you afford a dog? Learn your limits before you get a dog to help you make the right decisions. Financially providing for your dogs is a big part of being a responsible dog owner.</p><p>The cost of owning a dog can be estimated at about $1,500 to $9,900 per year. There are ways to save money depending on the choices you make. Contributing factors include your dog's size and age, the region in which you live, your own lifestyle, and your dog's individual needs.</p><h2> Basic Costs of Owning a Dog </h2><h2> Initial Investment </h2><p>Consider costs when choosing a dog. Any new dog or puppy will come with substantial expenses. If you decide to purchase a purebred dog from a breeder, you can expect to spend $500-2000, give or take. Spend the extra money on a quality dog from a reputable and professional breeder, not a ""backyard breeder."" It will cost you less in the long run because the dog will be healthier (and it's the right thing to do).</p><p>If you like mixed-breed dogs and you want to do your part to help dogs in need, then get your dog from a reputable shelter or rescue group. If you still want a purebred, there are plenty of breed-specific rescue groups. Adopting from a shelter or rescue can cost as little as $50 to $200. You are most likely to get a healthy dog when adopting from a reputable shelter or rescue group. Be aware that dogs with unknown histories might come with illnesses, so you may spend a bit extra on veterinary care.</p><p>Regardless of where you get your new dog, the very first thing you should do is get that dog to a good veterinarian. Depending on the need for vaccines, preventive medications, and special treatments, that first visit will likely cost you anywhere from $50 to $300, so be prepared. Vet bills for a young puppy will likely range from $100 to $300 depending on the puppy's health and the region in which you live. Puppies need to visit the vet every few weeks until about 16 weeks of age, and each visit can run you $100 to $300 depending on your pup's needs.</p><p>Your next major expense will be dog supplies. These include dog food, leashes, collars, beds, toys and so on. You also need to think about obedience classes and/or training resources. When the time comes to have your puppy spayed or neutered, expect to spend anywhere from $150 to $700. Bottom line, the first year with your new dog can cost twice the typical annual cost of subsequent years, so be prepared.</p><h2> Food and Treats </h2><p>It is important to feed your dog a high-quality dog food and healthy dog treats. This typically costs somewhere from $20 to $60 per month ($250 to $700 per year). Food expenses vary based on the size and energy level of your dog as well as the quality of the food. Be aware that special foods, like veterinary therapeutic diets or freshly-made special-order food, may cost $100 or more a month. </p><h2> Toys </h2><p>Dog toys are an important part of your dog's mental stimulation and exercise. Though some of us may indulge, you can probably plan on spending $25 to $150 per year. If you are like those of us who cannot resist a cute toy, this figure can become several hundred dollars higher. Another reason you may spend more on toys: a very destructive dog may go through toys faster, so if you have one of these dogs, invest in the toys designed for ""tough chewers"".</p><h2> Beds </h2><p>Every dog deserves a cozy bed and keeping one or two around the house will cost you $50 to $200 a year. Prices go up in relation to size and quality. Getting durable, high-quality and easy-to-clean dog beds can extend the life of the beds and keep costs down in the long run.</p><h2> Leashes and Collars </h2><p>Your dog must have one leash and one collar (with ID tags). Depending on the size and quality, most dog owners spend $20 to $50 per year on leashes and collars. However, you may be able to make one leash and collar set last for several years.</p><h2> Grooming </h2><p>Your dog's grooming needs are largely based on the type of hair coat he has. Smooth coated, short-haired dogs require little more than basic grooming while dogs with constantly growing hair will need to visit the groomer on a routine basis. Between the cost of grooming tools and visits to the groomer, you can plan on spending anywhere from $30 to $500 a year.</p><h2> Routine Veterinary Care </h2><p>Routine veterinary care is a huge part of keeping your dog healthy. Plan on going to the vet for wellness checkups once or twice a year at a cost of about $200 to $300 yearly. Annual lab work can add about $100 to $300 and should not be skipped as it's an important part of preventive health care. Dental cleanings may be recommended as often as once a year and generally range from about $300 to $800 if straightforward cleanings. If your dog has painful diseased teeth, their teeth will need high level treatment and extraction which can be about $800-$3000 or more depending on extent of dental disease and bone loss in your pets mouth. Of course, vet costs will be higher if your dog develops a health problem. This is more likely to happen as your dog grows older.</p><h2> Preventive Medications and Supplements </h2><p>All dogs need medications to prevent heartworms, fleas, ticks, and other parasites. Your veterinarian will guide you towards the best products based on your climate and your dog's needs. Vitamins are not normally needed for dogs on completely balanced diets however sometimes your vet may recommend a supplement like glucosamine or omega 3s. In general, you will probably spend $100 to $500 per year for these items depending on the size of your dog and his specific needs.</p><h2> Obedience Classes or Training Resources </h2><p>Though most dogs will only go to obedience school in their first year or two, training is something that should be ongoing throughout your dog's life. Whether you are buying books and watching videos for at-home training or you enroll your dog in obedience classes, budget at least $25 to $300 per year for training needs.</p><h2> Dog Walking </h2><p>Depending on your lifestyle, you may need to factor in the expense of a dog walker. If you or someone else can stay home and consistently walk your dog, you'll spend $0 or close to it throughout the year. If you aren't home during the day, work irregular hours, or have a dog that requires frequent outdoor trips that you can't always be there for, you'll need a dog walker, the costs of which can average $20 per walk. For one $20 walk once a day for every weekday of the month, you can expect to pay about $400 per month or more on dog walking.</p><h2> Pet Sitters or Boarding </h2><p>Most people will need to leave their dogs behind once or twice a year. Typically, this will cost about $100 to $300 a year. However, if you travel frequently, expect to spend much more. Boarding tends to cost less than hiring a pet sitter, but many dog owners prefer the individual attention a pet sitter can offer and think it is worth the extra expense. Alternatively, if you decide to travel with your dog, you can expect your travel fees to increase.</p><h2> Emergencies and Other Unexpected Expenses </h2><p>No one can predict the future; the unexpected occurs in life all the time. As a good dog owner, you should do your best to be ready for life's little surprises. Emergencies, chronic illnesses, disasters, and other unplanned expenses can amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year. The cost of an emergency vet hospital visit can start around $500 to $1000 and go well beyond $2000 to $5000. Advanced surgery is anywhere from $2000 to $5000 or more. If your sick pet needs to stay in the ICU, you could be looking at $200 to $500 per day and up. </p><p>The best way to stay prepared is to set aside extra money in savings, if possible. In addition to savings, some people keep a credit card or line of credit set aside specifically for emergencies. Some veterinary practices offer third-party healthcare financing or health care credit cards, such as CareCredit. You may even qualify for an introductory zero interest plan. </p><p>In a perfect world, dog owners would never have to make choices for their dogs based on money alone, Instead, it should be about what is best for their dogs. With proper planning (and a little luck) you can provide for your own dog and live a long and happy life together.</p>",1556
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-sitting-101-for-non-dog-owners-4098077,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Dog Sitting for Non-Pet Owners</h1>,"<h1>Dog Sitting for Non-Pet Owners</h1><p>Ever have a friend adopt a new puppy? Ever find a reason to hang out at said friend's house every day for the next year? It never fails that every time you visit the home of a cute little puppy, you mention to them that you would love to house sit or take care of their puppy! Who wouldn't want the joy of getting to love, play with, snuggle and wrestle with a new dog and then get to send them home for all the expensive parts like vet care and boarding and daycare? Well, finally your friend has an out of town wedding to attend and you have been chosen the lucky one to keep an eye on the puppy while they are gone! Happy days! But wait, now what do you do to do your best while taking care of someone else's pet? Luckily, we have some tips and tricks.</p><p>The first thing to mention, no matter how much experience you have taking care of dogs, is that each dog is unique and each dog owner has their way of dealing with their puppy. And as caretaker, it is your responsibility to respect that and follow their instructions as closely as possible even if it is not what you would do or how you do things for your dog. When taking care of a dog, it is best to do your best to keep them on the same structure and schedule that they live on at home. It isn't always possible to adhere perfectly to things, but always have the intention of doing your best at following it.</p><p>Let's talk first about if you are taking care of another person's dog and you do not have pets of your own. This situation presents a few challenges for you that need to be figured out before the dog comes over.</p><h2> How Puppy-Proof Is Your House?  </h2><p>When you don't have a dog of your own, it's easy to forget about the requirements a dog has to have a safe living environment.</p><p>As a non-puppy owner, it is your job to manage the environment for the dog you are taking care of so that they cannot get into anything and hurt themselves. </p><h2> Setting up Structure and Schedules </h2><p>it is up to you to work these things out. It's good to spend a minute looking at your life and how these things will fit in. It is always important to remember that dogs don't understand getting stuck in traffic, or having a last-minute date call, or not being able to get home for whatever reason. You are their primary caregiver, and you need to stick to it while they are with you. </p><h2> Where Do They Live? </h2><p>When a dog is staying with you, and you don't have dogs of your own to dictate where they live and what is their area, you need to decide on how much household freedom they have and what areas they are allowed in and where they are not allowed for their safety and protection. </p><p>This is often dictated by age and maturity levels of the dog, as well as what their family does at home, but it is important for you to do what is best for your house as well. In Creative Dog Training's 3 Rules of Housetraining, rule number 3 is ""When they cannot be with you, then they go into confinement."" And confinement for us is defined as the largest space a puppy will keep clean and not mess up. Whether this is a crate, a bathroom, the bedroom, or the whole house it depends on the dog you're taking care of and what they can handle. </p><p>Personally, my 12-year-old golden retrievers still got put in the living room or bedroom with a baby gate when the house was particularly disheveled because the boy one was always happy to go searching and see what he could get into when given a chance. But conversely, Margaret's golden retrievers have gotten free run of the house most of their lives because they don't get into things. It's just all about the dog, and how they respond. </p><h2> Where Will the Bathroom Walks Happen? </h2><p>It is inevitable that at some point the puppy you're taking care of will need to go outside to relieve themselves. If you find an urban location to move to with dogs, it can be hard to find a suitable place to walk them. So it is good to think about this before the puppy gets to your place and needs to be walked. If you have a yard, that's awesome! But, it is also important to make sure the yard itself is puppy proof if you are putting them out there by themselves. If you don't have a yard, you have to scope out the nearest grass area and make sure you have a ready supply of poop pickup bags when you go! </p><p>Finding a good place for the dog to go can depend a lot on the dog, some are used to having a large area to walk around and investigate. Others like their privacy and places to get away from prying eyes, or if they are all business when it's time to do their business and are happy to use a postage stamp sized chunk of grass. Knowing the area around your house is key, and knowing safe places where you can take the dog you are taking care of. </p><h2> How Much Exercise and When Do They Need It? </h2><p>Each dog's activity level is different, and it is important to talk to their puppy parents about what they do for exercise and how often they do it so you can keep it up. This is not only good for the puppy, but it is also good for you and your stuff! A tired puppy is less likely to chew things up and make messes of your things. It is always good to talk to the puppy's owner about if they take them a local dog daycare, so if you are not able to keep up with the level of exercise the puppy needs, then you can take them to daycare so that they can take care of their energy usage needs. </p><p>It is also good to check out our articles on good games to play with your pet, to give you some new ideas for creative ways to help them expend some energy. </p><h2> Emergency Situations </h2><p>Even in the best circumstances, emergencies happen. Happy, healthy puppies can suddenly start showing signs of illness, on a walk a paw pad might get a cut, or jumping off a bed or couch they may start limping afterward. You never know. So as caretaker it is key that you know 2 things in case of emergency: their primary veterinary clinic they go to, and the closest emergency or after hours animal clinic. </p><p>With this information in hand, you are ready in case of anything that comes up. It is also good to talk to the puppy's owner about what they want to be done in the case of emergencies, but at the end of the day, it is your responsibility to do what is best for the dog you are taking care of.</p>",1205
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-dog-sports-1118567,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Top 10 Dog Sports</h1>,"<h1>Top 10 Dog Sports</h1><h2>Sports and Recreation for Dogs</h2><p>Have you got a dog that needs physical exercise and mental stimulation? Dog sports can help keep active dogs both physically and mentally healthy. All dogs need some degree of exercise, but most will thrive with extra stimulation. Very active dogs are ideal candidates for high-performance sports like agility and flyball, though almost any healthy dog can enjoy participation.</p><p>When it comes to dog sports and recreation, there are plenty of options. Of course, make sure your dog has a thorough veterinary examination prior to starting any dog sport. Once your vet gives clearance, consider these popular dog sports that can challenge your dog's mind and body while reinforcing the canine-human bond.</p><h2>Agility</h2><p>Canine agility is a competitive dog sport that takes place within an obstacle course. Dogs are trained to make jumps, travel through tunnels, and navigate various walkways--all in a specific order. Each step of the way, the dogs are directed by their handlers (often their owners). This sport requires effective communication between the dog and the handler.</p><p>Agility is an excellent form of exercise and mental stimulation, making it ideal for high-energy dogs like Border Collies, Australian Shepherds, and Schipperkes. However, just about any healthy dog can participate in agility. The intensity and difficulty of the course can be altered to accommodate dogs with limitations or special needs. Teamwork between dog and human is the cornerstone of this sport.</p><h2>Canine Freestyle</h2><p>Canine Freestyle is a choreographed musical performance by a dog/handler team. Like it sounds, this activity is essentially dancing with a dog. As implied by its name, in canine freestyle almost anything goes. Basically, any move is allowed unless it puts the dog or handler in danger. Routines typically involve the dog performing twists &amp; turns, weaving through the handler's legs, walking backward, jumping, and moving in sync with the handler.</p><p>Canine Freestyle requires a deep bond between handler and dog as well as a mastery of basic cues, especially the heel command. Before putting a routine together, the dog must first learn each individual ""move."" A dash of creativity, plenty of patience, and a positive attitude will go a long way in canine freestyle.</p><h2>Conformation</h2><p>Conformation is a competitive dog activity during which purebred dogs are presented in dog shows and judged for accordance with their respective breed standards. Conformation trials, or dog shows, are designed to display purebred dogs with ideal characteristics of their respective breeds as determined by a purebred dog association such as the American Kennel Club or the United Kennel Club.</p><p>Ultimately, the goal of conformation is to maintain the highest standards of the dog breed so that future lines remain of the highest quality and inherited health issues are minimized. During confirmation trials, show dogs are judged by knowledgeable and experienced purebred experts who assess the dogs' physical characteristics, gait, and temperament.</p><h2>Disc Dogs</h2><p>During disc dog competitions, dog/handler teams are judged in disc-throwing events like distance/accuracy catching and freestyle routines. ""Frisbee"" is a trademarked brand name for a flying disc, hence the reason the word ""disc"" is often used.</p><p>To become a successful disc dog team, the handler must be able to properly throw a disc, controlling the distance and direction. The dog can then be trained to chase and catch the disc. High-energy dogs like Australian Shepherds, Border Collies, and Presa Canarios make excellent disc dogs.</p><p>During distance competition, the field is broken into zones by yard. Scoring is based on the zone in which the disc is caught. Freestyle events are judged and scored based on a predetermined point system. Rules and scoring vary with each disc dog group, club or association.</p><h2>Dock Jumping</h2><p>Also called dock diving, dock jumping is a competition where dogs jump from a dock into a body of water in an attempt to achieve great distance or height. Dock jumping is much like the human long jump or high jump, but with water. The best dogs for this sport are high-energy dogs that love water, like Labrador Retrievers.</p><p>In distance jumping, or ""Ultimate Air,"" the handler throws a toy off of the dock in an attempt to get the dog to jump as far away as possible. Distance is measured at the place where the tail base meets the water. Jumps are usually recorded digitally for accuracy.</p><p>The newer ""Ultimate Vertical"" is a high jump. A bumper is placed at a predetermined height. As competing dogs reach it, the height is recorded and the bumper is moved up. The winner is the only dog that can reach the bumper at its highest position.</p><h2>Flyball</h2><p>The sport of flyball is a type of relay race that involves teams of four dogs. One dog from each team runs down a course, jumping hurdles, towards the ""flyball box."" The dog steps on a panel and triggers the flyball box to release a tennis ball. The dog then brings the ball back over the hurdles to its handler. Once a dog has completed the course, the next dog is released from the starting line. The first team to have all four dogs complete the course wins. The game is played in several heats.</p><p>Flyball is a great way for your dog to enjoy time with other dogs, plus a nice way for you to meet other dog owners. Virtually any healthy dog that loves balls can play this game.</p><h2>Herding Trials</h2><p>Herding is an instinct for dogs in the herding group; it is the way they were bred. Sometimes, even some non-herding dog breeds or mixes will show an instinct for herding. Because many dogs live in urban or suburban areas rather than farms, the opportunity for herding is not presented. Enter the herding competition.</p><p>Most dogs that possess the instinct to herd absolutely love it. Training and trials are great ways to let them act out on instinct and have the time of their lives. Trials involve the dog, a group of animals (often sheep), handlers and judges. The handlers give commands and the dogs, such as the Black Mouth Cur, work their magic.</p><p>If you think your dog would enjoy herding, there are probably herding groups in your area to contact regarding training and competition.</p><h2> Lure Coursing </h2><p>Lure coursing is a fast-paced chase sport that was developed as an alternative to hare coursing. Rather than chasing a live animal, dogs chase an artificial lure across a field, compete for best time. Sometimes, obstacles are involved in the race.</p><p>While traditionally limited to sighthounds such as Greyhounds, Whippets, and Rhodesian ridgebacks, all-breed lure coursing groups are becoming more common. Lure coursing is an ideal activity to allow your dog to act upon his chasing instinct in a safe, humane way.</p><h2> Rally Obedience </h2><p>In Rally Obedience, dog/handler teams must complete a course made up of signs describing specific obedience exercises to perform. Judges design the course and observe as the teams swiftly navigate the course.</p><p>Rally Obedience rules tend to be less strict than traditional obedience competitions. Typically, Rally competition is open to all breeds. Trials usually have several levels, and teams compete for titles and championships.</p><p>For more information, check out APDT Rally and AKC Rally.</p><h2>Tracking</h2><p>You probably have noticed that your dog's nose is his most dominant sense. Most dogs want to follow their noses. Why not turn this talent into a fun and challenging activity?</p><p>A tracking trial is a type of test that requires a dog to follow a scent trail. These events mimic search-and-rescue missions, assessing the dog's natural ability and willingness to follow a trail left by human footsteps. Dogs and their handlers often enjoy this work, and success can open doors to pursue real-life search-and-rescue work.</p>",1251
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-chic-winter-wardrobe-5207926,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>5 Ways to Accessorize Your Dog to Look Chic for Winter  </h1>,"<h1>5 Ways to Accessorize Your Dog to Look Chic for Winter  </h1><h2>When cold weather hits, bundle up your pup in cute accessories.</h2><p>Winter is a time for cozy sweaters, warm booties, and snuggly blankets-not just for you, but for your dog, too. Whether you enjoy splurging on canine apparel for any occasion, or only consider dressing your dog up to suit the weather, wintertime brings many opportunities for both practical and adorable accessorizing, from bundling up your pup in warm clothing and booties, to swaddling him or her in fleece blankets and plush beds.</p><p>For some dogs, bundling up in warm clothing is more than just a fun activity. Certain types of dogs are less capable of regulating their body temperature, and they are more susceptible to becoming chilled or even hypothermic in very cold temperatures. Some dogs need a sweater or coat even when indoors, but especially when outside-particularly if there is snow. Some breeds that need more bundling up include those that are very tiny, such as the chihuahua, maltese, toy fox terrier and Yorkshire terrier.</p><p>Hairless breeds, including the American hairless terrier, Chinese crested, Peruvian Inca orchid and xoloitzcuintli, as well as those with sparse, short coats, such as the Boston terrier, French bulldog, Italian greyhound and miniature pinscher, may need extra protection against the cold. </p><p>When choosing winter clothes, beds and blankets for your dog, look for items that are machine washable or otherwise easy to clean. Whether you are looking to accessorize your dog for winter for fun or out of necessity, here are some basics to keep in mind.</p><h2> Add an Extra Layer </h2><p>Doggie sweaters and shirts are great for indoor wear (if safe) or sunny outdoor excursions when temperatures are chilly rather than freezing. A sweater wraps your dog in a soft hug and keeps its torso and sometimes legs covered and warm. You can even find doggie flannel pajamas-the perfect extra layer on a chilly winter evening. Doggie sweaters, shirts and pajamas come in a variety of fun styles so there's something for everyone's tastes, as long as your dog is not overheating in a layer it does not need.</p><h2> Make Walks Comfortable </h2><p>Just because it's cold outside doesn't mean you should stop walking your dog, but it's important to dress your dog appropriately so the walk is enjoyable for you both. In dry, cold weather, fleece vests, jackets or coats are comfortable, lightweight options that provide a lot of warmth. Quilted coats are thicker and very warm. Some dog jackets and vests are even designed so you can you use them as a harness by hooking your dog's leash to a ring on the back. If you're using a jacket as a harness, make sure they fit well enough that your dog can't slip out if they put on the brakes.</p><h2> Waterproof Warmth </h2><p>If you'll be outside in the rain or snow, invest in some water-resistant protective clothing for your dog. Doggie raincoats or rain ponchos are good at keeping your dog dry, but may be too thin to provide enough warmth unless you add an additional layer underneath like a sweater. If you want to streamline your dog's outerwear, you can find insulated dog jackets or coats with waterproof outer shell, which provide both warmth and protection from wet weather.</p><p>For regions with heavy snowfall, you can even find full body doggie snowsuits that protect your dog from head to tail. If your dog has long ears or long hair on its head, consider using a snood. Snoods are like fabric bags that slip over the dog's head and ears, staying in place with elastic. They protect your dog's long hair and ears from rain and snow. An added bonus: Snoods are also great for making mealtime neater by keeping your dog's long ears out of the food bowl. Plus, they look sleek and stylish.</p><h2> Keep Those Paws Dry </h2><p>Your dog's paws may be sensitive and susceptible to frostbite from freezing snow and ice. Dogs can also have painful ice balls get stuck in the hair between their pads. Snowy and icy conditions are also slippery, which can create slip and fall dangers for your pup. Winter booties not only keep your dog's paws dry and toasty warm; they also protect them from the elements and provide excellent traction so your dog can run and play in the fun winter weather. Booties come in many different styles, many of which are as fashionable as they are functional. Look for booties made from water-resistant materials and that have textured soles that are somewhat flexible so they are comfortable for your dog to wear. Booties come in different sizes to fit different paws.</p><p>Note that your dog's front paws might be a different size from the back paws, so measure both! Booties can also be used in spring and summer when hiking or walking on hot pavement. Many dogs will not know how to walk with booties on immediately, so some training and acclimatization may be needed before their first trip out.</p><h2> Create Cozy Spaces  </h2><p>It's warmer inside than out, but it's usually still chilly indoors in winter, so creating an inviting warm space for your dog to curl up will be a welcome addition. Look for an extra fluffy bed made of fleece or another cozy material. Beds shaped like donuts or those with raised sides offer extra snuggling potential. You can add a soft blanket or two for your dog to dig and arrange as nesting material, or go one step further and choose an enclosed ""pup tent"" filled with blankets or ""cuddle bed,"" which is designed with a flap over the top for your dog to crawl under and burrow into. You can find plenty of products that fit in with your own aesthetic, too.</p><p>If you take frequent car trips, add some warm blankets in the car, so your dog stays warm and comfortable on the road. It doesn't hurt to throw on a sweater before hopping in the car, even if you don't plan to take your dog outside. </p><h2> Have Fun Accessorizing for Winter </h2><p>As you think of your dog's comfort and warmth in winter, you have a lot of great options. If you like to pamper your pooch, it's a great excuse to have some fun and build up an exciting wardrobe with safe products. Always pay attention to your dog when outdoors in winter to make sure it is not getting too chilled. Keep your dog warm, dry, and happy, and you can conquer the winter together-indoors and out. </p>",1085
5,https://www.thesprucepets.com/your-dogs-basic-needs-1117433,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>How to Care for Your Dog's Basic Needs</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for Your Dog's Basic Needs</h1><p>As a dog owner, you want to know that you are taking proper care of your dog. This means learning about basic dog care and meeting your dog's essential needs to ensure its health and happiness. Proper nutrition, preventive veterinary care, health monitoring, grooming, a place to call its own, and plenty of exercise and affection will create an environment in which your dog can thrive. Luckily, all of these things are relatively easy to provide for your pooch.</p><h2> Before You Begin </h2><p>Properly caring for a dog begins with having the right perspective. Dog ownership should not be seen as a chore, but as an experience that enriches your life as well as that of your dog. Like humans, dogs need food, water, and shelter to survive. Yet, they also need physical care, mental stimulation, and nurturing to thrive. Providing these things is an essential part of keeping your dog healthy and safe and sets the foundation for a long, happy life with your dog.</p><h2> What You Need </h2><h2> Proper Nutrition </h2><p>A healthy, balanced diet is a fundamental part of basic dog care. Do some research into food companies that pledge to use high-quality ingredients and formulate foods that are nutritionally complete and balanced. Then, choose a quality diet that your pet enjoys. Spending lots of money on a holistic, top-of-the-line diet may not be necessary but you shouldn't skimp either.</p><p>Many companies provide samples you can try without buying a whole bag or case. Others offer a money-back guarantee if your dog doesn't like the food. If you choose to provide a homemade diet, discuss your options with your veterinarian first. Studies have shown that the vast majority of recipes available in books or online are not nutritionally complete or balanced. Then, make small batches until you're sure your dog actually likes it, and schedule regular rechecks with your vet to ensure you're meeting all of your dog's nutritional needs.</p><p>Once you find an appetizing diet, watch how your dog responds over the first several weeks. A drop in energy level, gastrointestinal problems, or a dull hair coat may warrant a diet change. If you do change your pet's food, always do so gradually-mixing some of the old food with the new-to avoid gastrointestinal upset or food aversion. It's also a good idea to ask your veterinarian for nutritional advice, especially if you notice any changes in your pet's health.</p><p>Water is also essential to keeping your dog healthy. Make sure that your dog always has access to plenty of fresh, clean water to drink.</p><h2> A Space of Its Own </h2><p>Dogs are social animals and they are generally not content when excluded from the family unit. Though some circumstances may require dogs to live outside, most will thrive when they can be with ""their"" people indoors.</p><p>Your dog should have an area of the house dedicated as being its own space, such as a kennel, crate, or bed. This is where your dog can go for some down time when things get a little overwhelming. Set your ground rules, enforce off-limit areas of the house, and welcome your dog into permissible areas.</p><p>If your dog spends time outdoors, provide access to a doggie door or a temperature-controlled doghouse. Never leave your dog unattended outside without shelter, especially during extreme hot or cold weather, as this can result in severe health consequences.</p><h2> Physical Maintenance </h2><p>Keep your dog healthy with regular exercise and preventive veterinary care. Establish an exercise routine, even if it's just a stroll around the block once a day. Depending on the breed, your dog may require more exercise to burn off extra energy and keep it fit.</p><p>Establish a good relationship with a veterinarian and schedule a wellness check-up for your dog at least once or twice a year. Quite often, potential problems can be identified and treated before your dog shows signs of illness. Within just a few visits, your vet will get to know you and your dog and be able to make recommendations for any health, nutrition, or behavior questions you have.</p><p>Every dog needs basic grooming, such as bathing, toothbrushing, and nail trimming. Some dogs even need regular haircuts. Find a reputable groomer or learn to groom your dog at home. Then, establish a grooming regimen that suits your dog's lifestyle and stick with it.</p><h2> Nurturing Your Dog </h2><p>Dogs thrive on structure and consistency. Proper training is paramount to your dog's quality of life. Choose a training program that works for your lifestyle and your dog's needs, then follow through with it.</p><p>You may prefer to join a training class with a professional instructor or want to learn about dog training on your own. Either way, reinforce good behavior and never punish your dog when the inevitable mistakes are made. Punishment is counterproductive and harms a dog's ability to trust. Be consistent and you will see positive results.</p><p>Maintaining the human-canine bond is vital for your dog to thrive and is a major component of basic dog care that many people disregard. Remember that domestic dogs are social animals that need interaction with humans. Set aside time for you and your dog to bond each day. Petting your dog, playing with toys, talking, or going for a walk or car ride are some ways you can strengthen and preserve this bond.</p><p>When your dog has to spend extended periods of time alone, give it something to do. Chews or food dispensing toys can help ward off boredom.</p><h2> Preventing Problems </h2><p>Any of the elements of basic dog care can be customized to your needs and what your dog accepts. Many dog owners, for instance, find that crate training is essential and that is where their dog spends much of its alone time. Then again, some people prefer more of an open living arrangement and train their dog to obey house rules without a crate. The key to remember is that if something is not working out, there's an alternative that you can try that might work perfectly.</p><p>It's also important to be patient with your dog and try not to make too many drastic changes all at once. Many dogs thrive on routine and upsetting that can lead to behavior problems.</p><p>Whenever you're in doubt about your dog's basic needs, ask your vet for advice. Beyond health concerns, vets want to make sure the animals they care for are living as happily as possible, so most are more than willing to help with any questions you have.</p>",1077
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/should-your-dog-sleep-on-your-bed-4589305,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Should You Allow Your Dog to Sleep on Your Bed?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Allow Your Dog to Sleep on Your Bed?</h1><p>Have you ever had someone gasp in horror when they discovered your dog sleeps on your bed? Perhaps you're a dog owner who wouldn't dream of letting your dog in the bedroom? Maybe you and your partner have heated debates about whether the dog can join you to catch some Zs. Or, perhaps you're one of those people who always ends up with the smallest sliver of space, right at the edge, while your dog sprawls out over the rest of your king size bed.</p><p>When it comes to this topic of debate, there is not a right or wrong approach. You just have to be aware of the pros and cons and make an informed choice.</p><p>If you let your dog sleep on your bed, don't worry, you're not alone. An article published in the journal Human Nature in 2017 suggested that around half of all dog owners let them sleep in the bed or bedroom.</p><p>The article also suggested that, while there can be problems that arise from this habit, the feeling of contentment it can create often outweighs them.</p><h2> Will It Impact the Quality of Your Sleep? </h2><p>There is no denying that sharing a bed with any species can disrupt your sleep. Any bed partner is likely to move and make noises that could wake you up, and Dogs' sleeping patterns are different from ours. It is not unusual for a dog to wake you up at the crack of dawn because they are ready to start their day.</p><p>But there are benefits to cosleeping with a dog. In 2018, a study was published in the Anthrozoos Journal. The results suggested that women generally slept better and felt greater security and comfort sharing a bed with a dog than they did with a human partner!</p><p>If you have a new puppy or rescue dog, sometimes allowing them to sleep in your bedroom will cause less disruption as they are more likely to settle being in your company.</p><p>Be aware though, if you do let them sleep in your room at first, making a transition to another arrangement later will be more of a challenge. It is best to start as you mean to go on.</p><h2> What Are the Health Concerns? </h2><p>There are often comments on how unhygienic it is to have dogs on the bed and that there is a risk of spreading zoonotic diseases (sicknesses that can be passed from animals to people).</p><p>Provided your dog is well-groomed, receives regular veterinary check-ups, and is treated with appropriate parasitic preventatives, then the risk is actually quite small. You should also consider that two-thirds of human diseases are reverse-zoonotic (capable of being passed from humans to animals), so maybe your dog has equal reason to be concerned.</p><h2> Will Your Dog Try to Dominate You if You Let Him Sleep on the Bed? </h2><p>Some people suggest that a dog afforded equal status and allowed to sleep on your bed will try to dominate you. This ""Alpha Pack"" mentality towards dog behavior has been widely discredited.</p><p>Although your dog may not be trying to dominate you, they can become possessive towards items of high value to them, like a super comfortable bed.</p><p>They may start growling if another pet, your partner, or even a child, approaches. This is something that should not be allowed.</p><p>Teach your dog that if they trade what they are guarding they will get something better. So, if your dog comes off the bed, they will get a super tasty treat, or your partner can reward them for allowing them on the bed without any fuss.</p><p>Resource guarding can escalate if not handled correctly. If you are concerned, we would recommend consulting a qualified behaviorist.</p><h2> When Might It Be More Appropriate for Your Dog to Have Other Sleeping Arrangements? </h2><p>There is nothing wrong with choosing to have your dog sleep elsewhere. Just be consistent, make sure they have a comfortable space, and reward them for going there. Separate sleeping areas can be especially beneficial under certain circumstances.</p><h3> When Toilet Training a Puppy </h3><p>There is a chance that your new pup could have an accident on your bed and their youthful exuberance may result in you having an interrupted night sleep. By settling your puppy in a crate, accidents will likely be fewer and easier to clean up, and it reduces their access to chewable items. You may decide to have the crate in the bedroom, so the pup still has close contact.</p><h3> For Elderly Dogs with Incontinence or Mobility Issues </h3><p>Some elderly dogs can develop incontinence and may be more likely to have an accident throughout the night.</p><p>You could use doggy diapers or, if you do want to move them off the bed, remember that they have been used to sleeping there. It could be confusing and distressing for them if you suddenly shut them downstairs and expect them to stay there. Moving them must be done with lots of positive reinforcement and may need to be done gradually. Perhaps an easy to clean dog bed placed right next to yours is a good compromise.</p><p>For dog's that have mobility issues, getting onto and off the bed can prove challenging, and it can be dangerous if they take a tumble. You could opt to splurge on a futon style bed that is low to the ground or invest in a set of doggy steps. </p><h3> If There Are Multiple Dogs and There Are Scuffles or Space Issues </h3><p>If you are living in a multi-dog household, having them all on the bed may not be practical. A good night's sleep may be elusive, and scuffles over space or being closest to their person can break out. </p><p>Some dogs will all sleep harmoniously on the bed together and, if you want to be surrounded by multiple dogs through the night, then perhaps the lack of space is something you are willing to tolerate! If not, it's certainly reasonable to have your dog's sleep on the floor or in another room. They have each other for company, after all.</p><p>If you have children co-sleeping with you, consider whether it is still appropriate to have your dog on the bed, too. Your child may not be so careful ensuring they don't roll onto or step on a sleeping dog, and even the best-natured dog can react negatively if they get frightened or are in pain, particularly if they are startled out of a deep sleep.</p><p>Smith, Bradley P. et al.

7,https://www.thesprucepets.com/different-types-of-dog-collars-1118613,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>8 Different Types of Dog Collars</h1>,"<h1>8 Different Types of Dog Collars</h1><p>Collars are worn by dogs for training, walking, identification, or even fashion. Use the following descriptions to find the right collar for your dog, then check out some leash varieties.</p><h2> Everyday Collars </h2><p>You can express your personal style with a variety of dog collars for everyday use. Collars with metal buckles or quick-release clasps are available in a variety of materials, colors, and styles. Many pet owners prefer buckle collars for stronger dogs, as quick-release clasps tend to be less sturdy.</p><h3>What is a buckle collar for dogs?</h3><p>Buckle collars are a standard type of collars for dogs that feature strong fabric (made from materials like leather, nylon, or cotton) woven between metal buckles and punched with holes to fit a variety of sizes. These collars have a simple, durable structure that is less likely to break than other styles.</p><p>Rolled leather collars are durable and less likely to cause hair loss or parting. Always be sure your dog's collar has a name tag with your current contact information in case he gets lost.</p><h2> Chain Slip Collars </h2><p>Often called choke chains, these collars are not recommended by animal behaviorists and most veterinarians due to their risks. They were initially intended for training purposes such as training a dog to walk on a leash and heel. The collar is pulled tight for corrections in behavior with a quick tug on the leash, causing it to tighten on the dog's neck. Over time, dog trainers have moved away from the choke chain method as it poses health risks and relies on punishment instead of positive reinforcement.</p><p>Generally, these collars are not recommended because they could damage your dog's neck, and even cause fatal strangulation injuries. This is especially dangerous in small breed dogs who are already at risk for tracheal problems. Chain slip collars should be left on a dog when unattended, as they pose a strangulation hazard.</p><h2> Metal Prong Collars </h2><p>Some trainers used to recommend these collars for strong, stubborn dogs with a tendency to pull on the leash, however these are no longer recommended by most animal experts. Also known as pinch collars, they are used for correction during training. These collars have metal prongs that pinch the skin when the dog pulls against it, and can lead to injuries of the skin, as well as injuries to the handler if their fingers get caught in the chain. These collars rely on pain and punishment to stop unwanted behaviors instead of using positive reinforcement. In many cases, dogs also learn just to stop pulling while the pinch collar is on, and the behavior does not generalize to other collars or leashes so they are not really learning proper walking techniques. These collars should be used with extreme caution and never be left on your dog when unattended.</p><h2> Smart Collars </h2><p>Smart collars are much more high tech than your traditional buckle collar. Different types of smart collars include various attributes, such as GPS to track your dog's location, the ability to monitor changes in their behavior, and assistance in training your dog. Most are compatible with smartphone apps, and some are even waterproof and have wifi coverage. The Link AKC Smart Collar even allows you to track your pup's activity and health!</p><h2> Martingale Collars </h2><p>Also known as limited slip collars or greyhound collars, Martingale collars are used to prevent dogs from slipping out of collars while walking on a leash. Though the collars tighten slightly with a tug of the leash, they do not tighten enough to cause discomfort and there is a stopping mechanism to prevent further closure on the neck. They tighten just enough to prevent a dog from slipping out of the collar. This is especially helpful in dogs with wide necks and narrow heads, like greyhounds, who can be at risk for slipping out of a traditional collar. Often made out of nylon or similar material, Martingale collars are available in a variety of colors and designs. These collars are especially suited for sighthounds but can be used on most dog breeds.</p><h2> Head Collars </h2><p>Head collars or halters slightly resemble muzzles, but they have a very different purpose. These halters act more like harnesses for the head and are intended to help train a dog to walk on a leash and heel. The head halter allows the handler to have more control of the dog's head and when unwanted behaviors occur, the handler is able to redirect the dog to the desired behavior. This training aid is currently favored by more animal experts since it allows for a positive reinforcement approach to training.</p><p>When used properly, head collars can successfully discourage pulling and support other training. Head halters should not be left on unattended dogs or dogs on a very long lead, as they may be able to back out of some types of head collars. The Gentle Leader is just one of many brands of head collars available for your dog.</p><h2> Harnesses </h2><p>Harnesses are designed for placement around a dog's chest and abdomen, crossing over the back. A leash can be attached to the top of the harness. Some dog owners prefer harnesses over collars, especially for dogs with a tendency to pull, because they put no pressure on the neck.</p><p>Harnesses are ideal for dogs with medical problems in the neck, back, and airway and should be used in dogs predisposed to these problems, such as small breed dogs. While a traditional harness is not a training device, some harnesses are designed to deter pulling, such as the Easy Walk Harness, which clips in the front of the chest to prevent pulling.</p><h2> Dog Show Collars </h2><p>Show Collars are slip collars typically made out of a braided material such as leather, nylon or metal. These collars should not be confused with chain slip collars, however, they can tighten around a dog's neck and should never be left on an unsupervised dog.</p><p>Martingale Leads are all-in-one collars and leads. They operate in a similar way as the Martingale collars. Commonly used for toy breeds in the show ring, the collar portion slips over the head and tightens when the lead is pulled and prevents it from slipping off. A plastic tube slides down the lead to keep the collar in place.</p>",1039

Balls of pet hair, urine stains on the carpet, droppings, shavings, or feathers getting into the most unusual places are all problems that many pet owners struggle with regularly.</p><p>Don't let this put you off owning a pet though; there are lots of easy ways to ensure that your pet and your home stay fresh and clean.</p><h2> Keeping Pet Hair at Bay </h2><p>If you have a dog, cat, bunny, or another small furry that sheds their hair, this is likely to be your biggest and most frustrating task.</p><h3> The Power of a Good Vacuum Cleaner </h3><p>Your vacuum cleaner needs to be capable of picking up pet hair effectively. It should have powerful suction, work well on all surfaces, and not get clogged easily by excess hair. You want one with a good filter that is easy to empty. It needs to get into all the tough-to-reach spaces, have tools for use on upholstery, and, ideally, should be as quiet as possible to minimize any stress for your pet.</p><h3> Regular Grooming Is Important </h3><p>While it is true that no amount of grooming will completely prevent shedding, it can make a huge difference, and it also helps maintain a healthy coat and skin.</p><p>There are many grooming tools designed specifically for shedding, and one of the most popular of these is the Furminator.</p><h3> Other Pet Hair Removal Products </h3><p>There are a number of other products, including lint rollers and rubber brushes, that can be useful for removing hair from upholstery, clothes and other soft furnishings.</p><h2> Removing Urine Stains </h2><p>While we all appreciate the perils of toilet training a new puppy, accidents can happen with cats, bunnies, and other small animals too.</p><p>Making sure that you clean up any urine or vomit stains quickly and thoroughly is essential from a hygiene perspective, to eliminate any odors, and to minimize the risk of the pet going back again to the same spot. Pet urine is strong, and you may think you have managed to clean it all away. But often, the uric acid lingers. Products that contain enzymes that neutralize the uric acid are often most effective. Always blot up as much excess urine as possible before applying the solution.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you do not have a pre-made solution, or you want something as natural as possible, a home remedy can work well. Mix one cup of white vinegar, one cup of water, and two teaspoons of baking soda and pop it into a clean spray bottle.</p><p>If you are worried about accidents you may not have noticed, you could invest in an ultraviolet light that will highlight any offending areas.</p><p>Of course, making sure that you work hard on toilet training your dog, cat, rabbit, or even a bird if they have a lot of cage-free time, should be a priority when they are first brought home to help minimize the number of accidents. If your dog, cat or rabbit is prone to spraying or scent marking, it may be worth speaking with your vet about spaying or neutering.</p><h2> Regularly Cleaning Bedding and Housing </h2><p>Whether it is washing your dog's or cat's bedding, or cleaning out a bird, small animal, or reptile enclosure, it is crucial that you keep up a regular cleaning schedule. Dirty cages can lead to a smelly home, discomfort for your pet, and a build-up of germs and bacteria that can even result in disease or infection.</p><p>If your cat uses a litter box, it should also be cleaned out regularly, and the quality of the litter you use can make a big difference. A hooded litter box will also help to contain stray litter and odors, as well as offering your pet more privacy. Vinegar can be great for dissolving any hard-to-remove urine build up. High-quality, absorbent bedding material can help to minimize offensive odors and may mean that cleaning does not have to be done quite as regularly. Don't forget that it is possible to litter train a rabbit too!</p><p>Any cage or enclosure must be safe and the right size for your pet. Some designs will contain stray bedding or droppings more effectively than others.</p><p>While reptiles and fish are probably some of the cleanest pets to keep, their tanks or vivariums can still become smelly, and if they get too dirty, it can be unsightly and even a health hazard for your pet. The bedding you use in a vivarium will depend on the type of reptile. Coconut fiber is a popular, environmentally friendly option for minimizing any odors.</p><p>Good cage hygiene is vitally important in helping to ensure your bird stays healthy as well as helping to minimize smells and excess feathers gathering in the home. Don't forget about the bowls and toys too; these can harbor germs if they are not regularly cleaned.</p><h2> Picking the Right Cleaning and Air Freshening Products </h2><p>Make sure your chosen cleaning products are safe to use around your pet. Always read the labels and do your research. Avoid strong, caustic products like bleach. Some people choose to make their cleaning products. This can be more economical, more environmentally friendly, and allows you to avoid the use of harsh or problematic ingredients. Just be sure to get approval from your vet before using any DIY natural solutions.</p><p>Essential oil diffusers are popular for using to freshen up the home, but certain essential oils can be hazardous to use around any animals (cats and birds are just a few animals that are particularly sensitive to them), and it will likely be better to find an alternative solution altogether.</p><p>If you do suspect that your pet has been poisoned by a toxic substance, you should contact your vet immediately or call the Pet Poison Hotline.</p><p>Preventing Fleas on Your Pets.</p><p>Common Problems in Aquatic Turtles.</p><p>Cage Hygiene in Birds.</p><p>Essential Oil and Liquid Potpourri Poisoning in Dogs.</p>",991
9,https://www.thesprucepets.com/boarding-your-dog-in-a-kennel-1118644,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>How to Kennel Board Your Dog</h1>,"<h1>How to Kennel Board Your Dog</h1><p>At some point, you will probably need to leave your dog behind while you travel. Though it is not easy to leave your pet, you want to be sure your dog has a safe, comfortable place to stay while you are gone. Depending on your situation, you could have a dog sitter come to your house or send your dog to a kennel to be boarded.</p><h2> Before You Begin </h2><p>If you are considering boarding your dog at a kennel, ask your friends and your veterinarian for recommendations. Then, call several boarding kennels to learn more. There are some basic questions dog owners commonly have about boarding. Be sure to ask the facility these questions before you make a boarding reservation for your dog.</p><h2> What You Need </h2><h2> Visit Kennels </h2><p>It is important to know what your dog's temporary living space will be like. Ask for a tour of facilities to ensure that the environment is neat, organized, and odor-free. Consider the cages or runs. While it might be fine for a crate-trained dog, boarding in a cage can cause anxiety for a dog not accustomed to it. Plus, older dogs with arthritis need more room to move around. If you don't like the idea of your dog staying in a small cage the whole time, look for a boarding facility that offers upscale boarding. These ""pet hotels"" often have small rooms with dog beds and toys, giving it the feel of a home environment. This might be the best option for boarding a dog that was not crate trained.</p><h2> Match Your Dog's Lifestyle With Exercise Options </h2><p>Some boarding facilities only let dogs out twice a day for a few minutes at a time. If this is something your dog is used to, then it might not be a problem. If you want your dog to get a bit more exercise, look for a kennel that is able to walk your dog three or more times daily. Ask if the kennel has a fenced-in area where your dog can roam a bit. If not, find out if the attendants are able to walk dogs around for several minutes rather than just letting them relieve themselves quickly and go back in the cage.</p><h2> Consider Food Plans </h2><p>Boarding can be stressful for your dog, even if it is accustomed to it. A change in diet can add to the stress on its body, possibly resulting in diarrhea or vomiting. Bringing your dog's regular food is the best way to prevent this. Find out if there is an extra fee to feed a special diet (this is somewhat customary). Be sure to stress the importance of feeding your dog its regular food. Some dogs will not eat well while boarding, so you may want to bring along something tasty yet healthy that can be added to the food to make it more palatable. Be sure to leave specific instructions with the boarding facility regarding what your dog can and cannot eat.</p><h2> Interaction With Other Dogs </h2><p>Some boarding facilities offer daily sessions where dogs are permitted to play together off-leash. While this is great exercise and can be fun for your dog, it can also be risky. Even dogs that get along with other dogs can become over-stimulated in a group environment, sometimes resulting in a dogfight. If dogs are allowed to play together, attendants should heavily monitor the dogs and only allow a few well-matched dogs to play together at a time. Ask the facility about their policies regarding dog playtime, including their established protocol if an injury occurs.</p><h2> Plan Ahead in Case of Illness or Injury </h2><p>Every boarding facility should monitor the daily habits of their boarders. Most keep a log of appetite, water intake, urination, and defecation. Vomiting, diarrhea, or other abnormal activity should also be noted. Some boarding facilities will perform a daily ""once-over"" on boarders to make sure there have been no changes in their physical condition, especially if the boarding facility is part of a veterinary hospital. If the boarding facility is not part of a veterinary hospital, find out where they take dogs that become sick. Ask if it is possible to have your dog transported to your own vet if it needs medical attention.</p><p>If your dog has a health condition, special needs, or requires medicine, look into boarding your dog with a veterinarian. Many veterinary clinics provide this option, which might be your only choice for a sick pet other than staying home to care for it.</p><h2> Budget for the Kennel You Choose </h2><p>Part of planning for vacation includes budgeting for your dog's accommodations. Be direct with the boarding facilities up front. Ask about the base boarding fee per day based on the size and type of dog you have. Find out if there are any hidden costs or add-ons, such as fees to feed your dog a special diet, administer medications, or take your dog for extra walks. Try to get a written estimate in advance if possible.</p><h2> Preventing Problems </h2><p>If you have done the research and decide that boarding is not right for your dog, you will have to consider alternatives. You might be able to find a pet sitter or board your dog with a friend or relative.

For pet owners wanting to take their furry friend along, international travel becomes even more complicated.</p><p>Here are some things you can do to help make an international trip with your pooch as easy as possible.</p><h2> Research Your Destination's Rabies Status </h2><p>Most travelers research their destination for the best activities, hotels, and restaurants before they depart, but dog owners will have to do some extra homework to learn all of the country's rules and regulations when it comes to entering with a dog-mainly because of rabies. Part of the reason why traveling internationally with your canine companion is often such a hassle is that some countries are determined rabies-free, while others are rabies-controlled. That means if you're traveling from a rabies-controlled country, like the United States, to a rabies-free country, like Japan, you should plan to spend some extra time at customs because it may not be an easy process.</p><h2> Visit the Vet </h2><p>While you're preparing for your trip, be sure to put a visit to your dog's veterinarian on the top of your To Do list. Not only will it give you an opportunity to discuss any concerns and ensure that your dog is in proper health to travel, but you will need to get your pet up-to-date on the particular vaccines that will be required for your destination country as well as request copies of your pet's vaccination records. Also keep in mind that while every country has different regulations, the vast majority are going to require your pet to be implanted with a microchip.</p><p>While most Western countries allow dogs, at the very least you will have to provide proof your pet is current on their rabies vaccination. Additionally, keep in mind that if you live in a rabies-controlled country, your pet must be vaccinated for rabies at least 30 days prior to your date of travel. There are some countries that will require even more vaccinations-in countries like France, Spain, and Italy, all pets must be vaccinated for distemper, while Australia requires vaccines including bordetella and canine influenza. It's always a good idea to research your destination's vaccine requirements before departing to ensure you don't run into any issues when you attempt to enter the country.</p><h2> Know the Rules </h2><p>Along with vaccines, dog owners should also keep in mind that some countries will require you to take additional steps, including securing import permits. If you're traveling from a rabies-controlled or high-rabies country, most countries will also require your dog to take a blood titer test.</p><p>There are also some breeds that certain countries won't allow in because they are considered ""violent,"" even if you have taken all the necessary steps and can present the appropriate paperwork. Although each country will have a varied list of breeds, some of the common banned breeds are Pit Bulls and Rottweilers as well as Dogo Argentinos and Neapolitan or Brazilian Mastiffs.</p><h2> Have the Correct Paperwork Handy </h2><p>While all countries will require a veterinary health certificate, the forms themselves can vary. That's why it's a good idea to contact the country's embassy in advance to obtain copies of all necessary veterinary paperwork specific to your destination, and be sure to have your vet fill it out within 10 days of entry. Believe it our not, some countries, like Europe, even have the option of getting their pet a passport. It looks much like a passport for a human, and allows dog owners to travel freely within the country with their pup in tow.</p><h2> Educate Yourself on Quarantining </h2><p>The possibility of having to quarantine a pet is enough to prevent most pet owners from attempting an international trip with their dog. But that's why it's essential to know the exact requirements for the country you will be visiting; while some countries don't even allow foreign dogs to enter, others may require a quarantine process that can last up to several months. Dog owners should be aware that countries with stricter regulations have quarantine requirements that can range from seven days to as long as six months, so it's crucial to educate yourself on the rules in advance.</p><p>However, as long as you do your homework, quarantining isn't something the average traveler will have to worry about. Most countries don't quarantine pets as long as owners have taken all of the necessary steps and secured the proper paperwork in advance.</p><h2> Make Pet-Friendly Accommodations </h2><p>Perhaps most importantly, you'll need to ensure that you're flying on a pet-friendly airline, and be sure to call in advance to learn all the steps you'll need to take to travel overseas with your dog. If you have a small breed, he or she might be allowed to ride with you in the cabin, but otherwise your dog will be riding in the cargo hold. Also keep in mind that some international airports won't accept domestic animals, so be sure you're booking a ticket to arrive at an import-friendly airport.</p><p>Whether you're traveling domestically or internationally, it can sometimes be a challenge to find pet-friendly travel accommodations. You'll want to confirm in advance if your car rental company allows pets. Also be sure to line up pet-friendly overnight accommodation and understand their policies, as some hotels charge additional fees or have certain rules with regards to the dogs who are welcome to stay, such as weight or size requirements.</p><h2> Keep Your Dog as Relaxed as Possible </h2><p>International travel can be stressful for any human, so it's a pet owner's responsibility to always consider the mental and physical comfort of their four-legged travel companion. That might mean investing in a cozy, quality carrier for your dog, stocking up on plenty of food, treats, and toys, and doing whatever you can to keep your dog as calm as possible, especially when dealing with the customs process. You'll also want to keep your dog's routine as normal as possible as you're waiting to board your flight and after you've arrived at your destination.</p>",1025

12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/flying-with-dogs-5191041,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>How to Fly With Your Dog</h1>,"<h1>How to Fly With Your Dog</h1><p>Booking a flight for your pooch isn't quite the same as flying by yourself or your family. If you plan on taking a trip with your dog in tow, you'll want to be sure you research the process ahead of time-possibly even months in advance. From federal aviation regulations to the rules and restrictions imposed by individual airline carriers, it's important to check all of the boxes to ensure a smooth flight for both you and your dog. And, of course, you'll want to know how to keep your pet comfortable and safe during what can often be a stressful experience. Here are some tips for flying with your dog.</p><h2> Do Your Homework </h2><p>For starters, be sure to add your pet when you book your ticket. Depending on your destination, you may have to get your dog tested or undergo a waiting period (this is primarily for international destinations or states such as Hawaii), and so you'll have to get started several weeks if not months before your flight.</p><p>It's always a good idea to check in with your vet and get the okay for your dog to fly, particularly if they have certain health conditions or any other issues that could be exacerbated by the stress of travel. Most airlines are going to want to see a health certificate from your pet's veterinarian, anyway. Dogs must be at least eight weeks old and in good health to be allowed on most airlines, and they will likely request proof that your dog's vaccinations are up-to-date (rabies in particular).</p><p>And be prepared for a bit of sticker shock: the fees for flying with your pet can range from as little as $100 to as much as $600 (or more) depending on the airline, the size of your dog, and the destination. Carry-on pets are usually more expensive to pay for than checked pets.</p><p>The rules may vary between airlines as well, so it's important to check in with your airline to ensure that you are meeting their requirements. Some airlines may charge a one-way fee for small dogs, and have specific requirements for the size of your animal as well as the type of carrier they can fly in. Larger breeds will likely be subject to ""excess baggage"" fees and their carrier will also be subject to inspection to ensure that the airline's requirements are met.</p><h2> Know Your Rights </h2><p>If you happen to be considering a flight with your service dog, be sure to brush up on both state and federal regulations that may apply. The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) allows any properly trained service animal to be able to provide assistance to a person with a disability during a flight. Though service dogs typically don't require documentation, the majority of airlines do have several requirements for support animals that must be met, so you'll want to be sure to meet these requirements before you check in for your flight. Service and therapy dogs are also treated differently from airline to airline, although many will let a service dog fly with you in the cabin at no additional cost.</p><p>When flying with service animals, the airline might require documentation from a physician as well as ample notice (at least 48 hours) prior to your flight. They may even require documentation that your dog can either go without using the bathroom (or can do so in a sanitary manner) for longer flights.</p><h2> Don't Forget Bathroom Breaks </h2><p>Your dog can't just pop into the restroom before the flight - and once onboard, it won't be ideal for your pet to relieve themselves - so an advance potty plan is always a good idea. Depending on the size (and bathroom needs) of your pet, you may want to bring a potty pad and maybe even a small trash bag with you, just in case. A preflight walk is always a great idea whenever possible (some airports may even have a dog park or other play area for your pet).</p><p>It's also a good idea to avoid feeding your dog right before the flight, or offering any sort of ""people food"" or other treats that may upset their stomach while they're in the air. A general rule of thumb is to offer your pet's meal about four hours before the flight.</p><h2> Strategically Book Your Seat </h2><p>It's not a bad idea to book your seat well in advance, and you may want to make it a window seat. If your dog is small enough to fit in a carrier that will be stowed under the seat in front of you, a window seat can ensure that you're not infringing upon the legroom of your fellow travelers. When flying with a larger animal (such as a service dog), you may want to arrange for a seat with extra legroom or ask your airline about other options to allow your dog to fit in front of you without blocking the aisle.</p><p>Keep in mind that airlines have regulations that will not allow dogs to block the aisle for safety reasons, and they are not required to upgrade your seat to accommodate your pet.</p><h2> Keep Them Cozy </h2><p>Flying is stressful for both humans and canines alike, so it's important to plan ahead to ensure that your dog remains as comfortable as relaxed as possible throughout your journey. Be sure to invest in an appropriately-sized carrier that your dog can turn around in. You may also consider taking a blanket or special toy that smells like home (particularly if your dog won't be flying in the cabin with you).</p><p>If your dog isn't used to traveling in a carrier, you'll also want to take some time in the weeks before your flight to help them acclimate to the tight space (try offering meals in the carrier as well as rewards for any time spent in there). Talk to your vet about any other anxiety-reducing strategies that might be necessary for your pet, including calming medications for particularly nervous dogs.</p>",998
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/should-dogs-wear-clothes-4586916,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Is It OK to Dress up Your Dog?</h1>,"<h1>Is It OK to Dress up Your Dog?</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Instagram is overflowing with accounts of dogs who have thousands of followers. Lots of these dogs have daily photos in another cute little outfit. They're not alone-there are many owners who maybe aren't as social media-savvy that like to dress their pup in fun dog clothes. This does court controversy: Many would argue that a dog is a dog and they should not ever be dressed up.</p><p>However, some clothing items are truly for the dog's benefit. Even when canine clothing is not necessary, that doesn't mean that dressing up your dog is terrible. Every dog is an individual, and owners need to approach each situation with common sense and the dog's happiness and comfort at the forefront of their mind.</p><h2> 5 Times It's OK to Dress up Your Dog </h2><h3> Cold Weather </h3><p>You may hear people argue that a dog doesn't need to wear a coat-they already have one. Yes, this is true, but every breed is different in terms of their coat types and their ability to cope with wintry weather. A whippet, for example, has a thin coat and very little body fat. Compare them with a Newfoundland that has a thick double coat and has been bred to survive in severe weather conditions, and it is obvious which one is more likely to need to wear a doggy jacket or sweater!</p><p>Elderly dogs and puppies are also more likely to feel the cold than a fit, active, and healthy adult dog.</p><h3> To Help a Nervous Dog Feel More Secure </h3><p>If you have a nervous dog, it may respond well to a Thundershirt or a tighter fitting sweater or doggy t-shirt. The ""snuggly"" pressure created has often been shown to have a calming effect.</p><p>It's important to remember, though, that this doesn't work for every dog, and it's essential to make sure that if your dog is nervous, you should introduce it to the item gradually, when your dog is relaxed and in conjunction with lots of tasty rewards.</p><h3> After an Operation or Illness </h3><p>If your dog has a nasty skin infection, contact allergy, or surgical incision, sometimes putting them in a little doggy coverall or t-shirt can help protect the skin and stop them from licking and delaying healing.</p><p>Don't forget that this is not a solution for all skin conditions and it is vital to seek advice from a vet if an issue develops.</p><h3> For a Photo Opp (If Your Dog Is Comfortable) </h3><p>We all know how much everyone loves a photo of a cute dog in a novelty outfit. If you want to get a photo like this, as long as your dog is comfortable and is not being forced into wearing something it doesn't want to, then why not? Make sure that it's fun for your dog, they are not left in anything cumbersome too long, and always pair the photoshoot with lots of tasty treats. Some dogs do love the attention they get when a dress-up session is happening!</p><h3> For a Special Occasion </h3><p>At Halloween, Christmas, and other significant occasions, we often see elaborate costumes for dogs available at the pet stores.</p><p>We all want our beloved companions to be part of the festivities. Just make sure that if you're going to put your dog in a holiday outfit, it's comfortable to wear, they are happy to have it on, and that it is not too cumbersome.</p><h2> When It's Not OK to Dress up Your Dog </h2><h3> If Your Dog Is Fearful or Unhappy </h3><p>If your dog is showing signs of fear and discomfort, don't put clothing on your dog unless it is necessary. Be fair and consider the fact that you are doing it for your gratification and not theirs.</p><p>If your dog shows signs of being unhappy or fearful, don't force it. Not only could it start to associate the camera coming out with being shoved into some uncomfortable costume-making the dog less likely to pose happily-but you could end up making your dog mistrustful of you, and it could react negatively.</p><h3> If the Outfit Will Make Them Uncomfortable </h3><p>Make sure that whatever clothing you put on your dog is comfortable. A coat has to be the right size for your dog; you don't want it to rub and cause pain or irritation or be a tripping hazard.</p><p>If you are considering a novelty outfit, make sure it's not too cumbersome and that it does not impede their movement or vision. Watch out that the item is not so heavy that it could cause your dog to overheat. Don't leave it on for long periods or unsupervised. And most of all, only put your dog in the outfit if you are sure that they are happy.</p><p>If, for example, a dog feels the cold and needs to wear a coat, it's important to get your pup used to it gradually. Start by placing the coat somewhere in plain view of the dog where it can investigate the item at its own free will. Be sure to administer lots of yummy treats during this time. With each session, slowly bring the item closer to your dog. Gradually move onto touching the coat to your dog's body, before finally putting on the coat for short durations. If at any point your dog becomes uncomfortable or you are moving too fast, you need to go back a step and spend more time at this stage before moving on. The goal is that your dog will associate the coat with lots of treats and views it as something positive and not something that they are frightened of and forced into.</p><p>Many dogs can end up loving a dress-up session if introduced in a fun and positive fashion.</p>",938
14,https://www.thesprucepets.com/taking-puppy-on-a-road-trip-4019484,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Traveling With a Dog or Puppy on a Road Trip</h1>,"<h1>Traveling With a Dog or Puppy on a Road Trip</h1><p>Traveling the four corners of the United States and beyond is a great passion for many people, and traveling cross-country with your dog can take the experience to whole new heights. Despite your love of road trips, though, it's important to prepare well in advance before deciding if a road trip with your dog is a good idea.</p><p>Even the most seasoned car-riding dog may not be comfortable if it's stuffed in the back seat of a car for 12 hours as you traverse the country. Preparing your dog (and yourself) for the trip before it rolls means that, should an emergency arise, you can predict how your dog will handle it and ensure you both stay safe and healthy.</p><p>Just like you wouldn't head out on the road without a solid snack stockpile, you shouldn't bring your dog on a road trip without substantial preparation. Read on for our tips for preparing to travel with your dog or puppy on a road trip.</p><h2> What Does Your Dog Need? </h2><p>The basic necessities seem easy: dog food and medication (if your dog takes medicine). But that is not all. What is the dog going to eat out of? Where do you store the food? What about water and dog bowls? This all takes up precious space in your vehicle.</p><h3> Food </h3><p>The best solution is to get a 10-pound sealable food bin for the food, and then within the spare space within the bin, pack any medications. You should also include a Ziploc bag containing vet records, food bowl, water bowl, and collapsible travel water bowl.</p><h3> Comfort Items </h3><p>Some dogs, especially young ones, will need comfort or enrichment items. Little puppies need to eat several times a day since they are growing at such a fast rate. Pack some snacks for use between meals. Include a couple of good chew toys (especially for teething puppies), and some comfy bedding for them to stretch out on. As for enrichment items, some dogs might be content with a familiar toy or chewable item, but think about what will keep your dog occupied or distracted during a bout of bumper-to-bumper traffic. If your dog is a fan of peanut butter, this might be a good time to take a spoonful and stuff it down a hollow toy. Dogs can get distracted for hours trying to get to the very last lick of the stuff.</p><h3> A Sweater or Jacket </h3><p>You need to think of the climate that you are traveling to. Will it be cold? If you have a dog with a thin coat, no undercoat, or very little body fat, your dog could get cold very easily, so pack a dog sweater or jacket.</p><h2> Training and Preparation for the Road </h2><p>Before taking your dog on a country-wide tour, you have got to make sure they are a good canine citizen.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Off-leash vocal control of your dog is essential if your dog is ever unleashed outside.</p><p>These behaviors do not have to be perfect, but some are absolutely essential, like waiting to jump out of a car when prompted. If you get a flat tire, pull over to the side of the road, and open your door and your dog automatically follows you, it can be a disastrous situation so close to fast-moving traffic. You need to teach your dog to wait-it will be important for your dog's safety and mutual happiness if you work on each of these behaviors before starting your road trip.</p><h2> Medical Preparation </h2><p>Before travel, make sure that your dog is up-to-date on vaccines and that you have a hard copy of those records. It would also be prudent to get a health certificate from your vet. Health certificates are required to fly a pet anywhere and may be helpful if you are confronted by law enforcement about your dog's health.</p><p>It helps to get a thorough physical before you leave. This way you can feel confident that your dog is in peak health before you travel to the unknown and without a regular, known vet to immediately take your dog to.</p><h2> Travel Practice </h2><p>Start small and build up your dog's car rides. Start with nearby daily short car rides to work or the park. Then, gradually build up to hour-long car rides to fun places like to a lake or another park. Usually, within an hour from any major city is a nice mountain, river, or lake that would be a great day trip. If your dog has not been on many long car trips, make a point to try one or two that last 5 to 10 hours in duration.</p><h2> The Mental, Emotional, and Physical Toll of Traveling on a Dog </h2><p>Your goal should be to make travel fun for your dog. Before getting in the car, make sure the dog is properly exercised and a bit tired. A great tip: The day before you go on a long trip, treat your dog to a full day of doggy daycare. Not only is it good for the dog, but it allows you to load up the car and clean the house without a dog underfoot. While you do your thing, your dog can play with dog friends all day (perhaps even with a bath or spa time). You can get all the things you need to do done without stressing out the dog, and the dog is good and tired for the car ride the next day. It's a win-win situation.</p><p>Once you hit the road, take regular bathroom breaks so your dog can stretch its legs and sniff a new state. Treats should be a regular reward for being a good car pal. Keep things fun to make sure that your four-legged companion will always want to hop in the car for the next leg of the adventure.</p>",970
15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-you-lost-your-dog-4706897,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>What to Do if You Lost Your Dog</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if You Lost Your Dog</h1><p>No matter how careful you are, sometimes Fido manages to break free from his leash or escape from the backyard in pursuit of a squirrel-or just because he felt like exploring the neighborhood. The good news is that there are plenty of ways to prevent your dog from getting lost-but if your dog does go missing, here's what to do to help bring him home.</p><h2> Sweep the Neighborhood </h2><p>In many cases, a well-trained dog is the safest dog when it comes to not getting lost. If your dog knows and responds well to basic commands like ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and ""come""-as all dogs should-you'll want to head outside and start calling his or her name and using a command like ""come"" (or other special phrases you know your dog would typically respond to, like ""ride in car"") to see if that's enough to bring Rover out from wherever he's currently hiding in the neighborhood.</p><p>You may also want to bring an extra special treat or his favorite food in order to help use his sense of smell to lure him home. Sometimes leaving your dog's bedding or some clothing with your scent by the location where your pet went missing will help him find his way back.</p><p>Your dog may very well be scared, but depending on your pet's personality and how they may react when an unknown person approaches them or attempts to pick them up (assuming you haven't lost your Saint Bernard, that is), you may also want to alert your neighbors or people in the area of where your dog went missing and instruct them on how to approach your dog when spotted. Be sure to share her name and photos so that everyone in the general vicinity of your home (or wherever your dog went missing) knows exactly who they're looking for. If you have other dogs, be sure to recruit them, too-their powerful noses may be all you need to help lead you to the direction where their best bud is currently hiding.</p><h2> Use Your Pet's Microchip </h2><p>Proper identification is always key to finding a lost dog-including a collar with ID tag as well as a microchip- so one of the first things you should do is alert your dog's microchip company. The whole point of having your pet microchipped is to help find them if they've gone missing. Be sure to ensure that the contact information the microchip company has for you is up-to-date, particularly if you moved recently or changed phone numbers.</p><h2> Print Some Fliers </h2><p>Posting fliers may be the old-fashioned approach to pet recovery, but it's still extremely effective. Print a flier with a current photo and description of your dog, as well as your contact information and other relevant information about your pet's personality (such as if they tend to run when approached directly). Be sure to include a reward if you're planning on offering one. Post your fliers in as many places as possible, including utility polls at busy intersections, and don't be afraid to hand them out to people directly, from neighborhood children to your mail carrier. If you've been fortunate enough to receive phone calls with sightings of your dog, head to those areas to continue your search and post or hand out additional fliers.</p><h2> Rely on Social Media </h2><p>In addition to fliers, today there's also the power of social media to help retrieve your beloved pooch. Post an alert on your personal page and ask everyone to share, and you'll also want to post your dog's photo to as many local groups as possible; there may even be Facebook groups dedicated to finding lost pets in your area. You can also set up a dedicated Facebook page where you can include additional information about your pet and people can share with their friends or neighborhood organizations as well as post sightings.</p><h2> Call Local Animal Organizations </h2><p> If someone is kind enough to bring your lost pet into the nearest veterinarian's office, animal control office, or animal shelter, you'll want to be sure they know in advance exactly who your pet is. Be sure to give them a call, or stop in with one of your fliers, so they know how to find you if your dog ends up in their office. Sadly, sometimes shelters do have to turn away animals if they're full, so it's imperative that they know in advance that if your dog walks through the door he already has a home and they can contact you immediately. But be sure to keep following up, as there's no guarantee they will call you if your dog does turn up.</p><h2> Know Where to Look </h2><p> If the hours are ticking by and your dog is still missing, try to put yourself in his paws-if you were your pet, where might you go? Think of anywhere your pet knows and enjoys going, such as a local park, as well as anywhere he or she may feel safe and hidden, such as wooded areas or even a cemetery. You may also want to head to any local fast food chains or restaurants, because a lost, hungry dog will be attracted to the aromatic food smells and could potentially be found raiding their dumpster outside.</p><h2> Don't Give Up </h2><p>No matter what, keep looking. It's a terrifying, heartbreaking experience to lose a four-legged member of your family, and even if a few days-or even weeks-have gone by, keep in mind that though your dog may be accustomed to sleeping on a plush dog bed and eating out of a fancy dog dish, most dogs will become very resourceful and rely on their instincts to survive when they're out on their own. In the meantime, remain diligent and persistent and continue sharing, posting, and searching until your beloved pooch is back in your arms.</p>",975
16,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ideas-for-a-dog-birthday-party-4158212,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>10 Ways to Celebrate Your Dog's Birthday</h1>,"<h1>10 Ways to Celebrate Your Dog's Birthday</h1><p>Your dog showers your family with unconditional love, affection, and loyalty, so return the favor with doggy-approved desserts and gifts at a special birthday event for your favorite pooch. Read on for some easy-and adorable-ways to make your dog's birthday pawty memorable.</p><h2> Choose the Perfect Present </h2><p>Let's face it: Our dogs are spoiled every single day, but their birthdays are actually a legitimate reason for some serious doggy spoilage! Whether your pooch prefers tennis balls, Kongs, or softer, homemade toys, there's no better reason than its birthday to hit up the toy aisle at your pet store.</p><p>Another fun (and hilariously adorable) idea: Put your pup in a room with a ton of tennis balls and watch the excitement ensue.</p><h2> Deck the Halls </h2><p>You've helped your friends and family decorate for a million birthday parties, so it's only appropriate that you decorate for your precious pooch's birthday.</p><p>Balloons and streamers are standard birthday party decor, of course, but there are tons of doggy-themed ways to do it up, too. Make a cute, bone-shaped banner with construction paper and yarn or twine, toss dog-friendly confetti on all of the tables, and-if you're a little bit craftier-make a chalkboard sign with the drink and snack menu.</p><p>If you're not super crafty, you can buy doggy-themed banners online instead.</p><h2> Make Dog-Friendly Pupcakes </h2><p>Believe it or not, lots of dog-friendly birthday cakes are human-friendly, too. All you need are some everyday baking ingredients, such as whole-wheat flour, baking soda, eggs, and applesauce or baby food, to make an amazing canine cake. Blend in shredded veggies such as carrots for a boost of nutrients and top it with cream cheese, peanut butter, or blended bananas.</p><p>Don't feel like breaking out the baking gear? No dog has ever turned down peanut butter paired with his favorite treats.</p><h2> Doggie Ice Cream </h2><p>Although real ice cream isn't great for your dog's gastrointestinal tract, it's easy to whip up some puppy-approved ice cream at home with ingredients you probably already have in your pantry. Blend bananas with plain yogurt and creamy peanut butter, then freeze overnight to get the right consistency. You can also make puppy ice pops with one basic ingredient: Chicken or beef broth. Simply pour it into a mold and freeze.</p><h2> DIY Some Cute Party Wear </h2><p>There's literally nothing cuter in the world than a party hat on a puppy. It's super-easy to make your own by gluing-be sure to choose the non-toxic kind-construction paper, poster board, or foam paper into a cone shape. Then, decorate with a permanent marker, pompoms, tassels, or any other accouterments that will make your pupper feel extra festive.</p><p>What if your dog won't wear its party hat for longer than 20 seconds? Whip up a no-sew bandana with some cute fabric and fabric glue or hemming tape or a no-sew tutu with elastic and strips of tulle.</p><h2> Invite the Entire Squad </h2><p>What's a puppy party without your dog's entire gang? Invite the crew over for a day of running, snacks, and sniffing in celebration of your furry family member's birth.</p><p>Put out plenty of water and, if the other pet parents are OK with it, some snacks for paw-ty guests. Portioned dog treats, sliced frozen bananas, baby carrots, and green beans are all healthy snacks that are easy for dogs to pick up and munch on.</p><p>Be sure to keep a close eye on your dog and its guests while they're playing. Even the best dog buds can have misunderstandings sometimes.</p><h2> Don't Forget About the Humans </h2><p>Aside from an afternoon of cute dog shenanigans, you have to give your human guests some incentive to come to the puppy party, too. Enter, delicious party foods and drinks. Whip up a few party favorites like chicken wings, spinach, and artichoke dip, and deviled eggs, serve beer, wine, or-if you're really into the party theme-a custom cocktail in honor of your doggy's day.</p><h2> Set Up a Photo Booth </h2><p>Strike a paws! Make your own photo booth backdrop, grab some props (that your guests may or may not tolerate for a few seconds), and get 'gramming! Have your guests upload their photos to Instagram or Facebook with a custom hashtag (every happening event has one!), so you can see all of the fun in one place.</p><h2> Play Games </h2><p>The best part of these dog-friendly party games is that they're actually basic training techniques disguised as fun! Make sure you have plenty of toys (and treats) for games like hide-and-seek and fetch, which help dogs practice commands like ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""come,"" and ""fetch.""</p><p>If you really want to take your puppy party games to the next level, try a round of Snoopy Says. Like the human version, Simon Says, participants listen to commands and make certain movements. The last pupper standing wins!</p><h2> Make Paw-ty Favors for Guests </h2><p>What's a birthday party without a jam-packed favor bag? Include some small toys, such as a tennis ball or chew toy, a handful of dog bones or jerky sticks, a party hat or bandana and, of course, some on-the-go treats for the humans, too.</p><p>This depends on you! Your dog's birthday can be on the actual day it was born (if you know it, give or take), or on its ""gotcha"" day, the day you adopted it! Our feeling? Have as many birthday parties as you want!</p><p>Dogs cannot eat chocolate, and should not eat a cake made for humans. However, there are plenty of healthy recipes on the internet for you to make for your pup. Additionally, there are great deliverable birthday cakes your dog is sure to love.</p><p>Various breeds of dogs have different lifespans, but as a general rule, canines live from 10 to 15 year old.</p><h3>Watch Now: If Your Dog Could Text, They Would Say This</h3>",950

And while these posts are undeniably adorable, there's a deeper significance to our obsession with other people's pets. </p><p>Jessica Maddox, Assistant Professor of Digital Media at the University of Alabama and author of the forthcoming book (Rutgers University Press, 2022), looks at pet and animal accounts within the larger context of our online activities.</p><p>""One of the central arguments of my book is that the internet, despite its desire to connect people and be social, is a pretty trash place,"" she said, but it's animal content that keeps her from feeling despair. ""For all of the shortcomings of the internet, when we share pets and animals with each other online it actually gives me something to be optimistic about. [It shows] we're willing to take care of each other. By sharing your joy and cuteness, this makes me happy, and then I want to share it with you because I think it will make you happy. That's kind of nice to cling to and amidst all the other problems of the world and the internet.""</p><p>Maddox notes that our increased need for positive digital connections during the physical isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic ""accelerated a lot of what we did with pets and animals online.""</p><p>Take Rebecca Shore in Jacksonville, Florida, who fell in love with The Golden Ratio's gaggle of golden retrievers (and one labradoodle) in 2020. ""I can't tell you how much this account has meant to me during the course of the pandemic,"" she said. ""The dogs are sweet, and GR Mom and GR Dad are so sweet and funny with them. I watch the Daily Snaps every night as a wind-down because it's such a positive, relaxing vibe.""</p><p>The Golden Ratio / Instagram</p><p>Like Rebecca, Lorie Kinler in Fort Worth, Texas relied on her favorite internet pet, Crouton the cow, to life her spirits when COVID-19 kept her isolated from family and friends. ""During the pandemic when everyone was stuck at home, they would post a video every evening called the Nightly Crouton,"" she said. ""I would watch it every night before I went to sleep. It made me smile and brought me so much joy during a difficult and scary time. I think it did the same for so many people.""</p><p>Kinler even got to meet Crouton IRL at Squirrelwood Sanctuary when she visited New York this fall, an experience she found especially meaningful. ""I was so happy to meet Crouton and all the animals that helped me through a dark period. It was one of the most memorable times in my life!"" she said. </p><p>Professor Maddox says the right pet accounts have a way of bubbling up when we need them the most. In 2017, Fiona, the Cincinnati Zoo's premature baby hippo, served as a source of hope and inspiration for many as she fought to survive after being born 6-weeks early at just 28-pounds. Alicia Mountain, a poet in Brooklyn, NY was one of those people. ""In January 2017 I was in the first year of my Ph.D. and Trump had just been inaugurated- suffice it to say waking up each morning felt really hard,"" she told me. ""I tracked all her ups and downs on the zoo's Instagram account. The metaphor was pretty obvious, but that didn't change how much it sustained me: if this tiny fragile hippopotamus could survive in the world, so could I."" Like Alicia, Nancy Allen in Sacramento, CA felt a special bond with the tiny hippopotamus in early-2017 as Trump took office and her father faced a terminal cancer diagnosis. ""I remember sitting in the hospital room and seeing a video about this tiny hippo that had been born in Cincinnati,"" she said. ""I started following the Zoo on Facebook and Instagram and being able to celebrate her teeny tiny successes gave me something to be hopeful and joyful about."" Both Nancy and Alicia still follow Fiona's adorable antics on social media nearly five years later.</p><p>Fiona the Hippo / Instagram</p><p>If Fiona was the animal metaphor of 2017, Noodle the Pug is the animal metaphor of 2021. For those who don't know, Noodle is an elderly pug who rose to TikTok fame thanks to his owner, Jonathan Granziano's brilliant videos in which Noodle acts as an oracle for what sort of day we're going to have. No Bones Days (aka when the 13-year-old pug does not stand up in his dog bed) have come to signify it's OK to take a mental health day.</p><p>Noodle / Instagram</p><p>Professor Maddox understands why Noodle's videos have stood out in the crowded field of internet pets. ""People are being summoned back to offices to work, so work life is going on but there's this pandemic, there's still all theses other stressors,"" she said. ""With Noodle it's like, 'Yes, this is exactly how I feel today.' I feel like this is a no-bones day because life is really hard, and this pug understands me tapping into that stuff.""</p><p>Sharing a No Bones Day video with your friends is like saying ""Phew, it's not just me who is exhausted"" at a time when many of us are struggling to adjust to a constantly in flux post-vaccinated life. </p><p>""Being home for almost two years now, he's always been my buddy, but he's really my companion right now,"" Granziano said. ""He's the one who keeps me focused on the day. He's the one who keeps me from spiraling with existential dread. [Dogs are] blissfully unaware of what's going on, and there's something comforting about that.""Our love for other people's pets makes the internet a better place. So go ahead, embrace your obsession. </p>",963

The ferocious game featured more than 100 adorable pups who themselves were in fierce competition.</p><p>Divided into two teams-the valiant Team Ruff, and the spunky Team Fluff-these puppies were there to fight for the victory of being the first to drag a chew toy over the end zone. But the real stakes at hand were who will be able to go home with a forever family: The Puppy Bowl is actually hosted for pups to get adopted. Since 2005, the referees, coaches, participants, and adoring onlookers have cheered the puppies on while supporting statewide local shelters who put out players that are also looking for owners.</p><p>This year's Puppy Bowl was just as cute as previous years, with some cute high-stakes competition marking the hours before the actual Super Bowl took place. </p><p>Below, some highlights of the ferocious match-up.</p><h2> There Were Some Real Standouts </h2><p>There was a fierce face-off for the title of MVP (and an online poll on Animal Planet's website to vote!). Pups that stole the show included Odell Barkham, a chow chow/beagle mix from Team Ruff; Irwin, a chihuahua/American pit bull terrier from Team Fluff; Kirby the labrador retriever from Team Fluff; and Chorizo, a dachshund/ American Staffordshire terrier from Team Fluff.</p><p>Ultimately, the MVP award did go to Marshall, the Boston Terrier. He also won in a close showdown with Tank the Rottweiler/Boxer mix to be crowned ""Most Popular.""</p><p>All these little angels pulled out their A game with their ability to drag those toys down the end zone! Check out the lineup here.</p><h2> Some Pups Preferred the Sidelines </h2><p>Yet while some thrived, other certain good boys and girls were getting stage fright and reluctant to go for any toys. Team Fluff's Squeak, a small little Pomeranian/ Chihuahua, had to get a ""pup talk"", in the corner, while Raspberry the Poodle/Chihuahua was also not in the mood to warm up, needing major encouragement (and earning an contendership for the underdog of the game). Nevertheless, they were still just as adorable.</p><h2> Team Fluff Pulled Ahead Early </h2><p>With team members like Kirby scoring double touchdowns left and right, Team Fluff led with an initial lead against Team Ruff going into it. Footage of Kirby, Chorizo, Irwin, and other members of the lineups can was well received as they dedicatedly dragged their toys around.</p><h2> Being Picky Paid Off </h2><p>Odell Barkham was very particular; he first courted a pizza toy before deciding pepperoni was not his thing. His pickiness did pay off, though. With the knowledge of how much Ruff needed to score as the game went on, he went for gold as he dragged a monkey over the touchdown zone. This courageous move put Ruff in the lead for much of the game.</p><h2> Commander Biden Made Special Appearance </h2><p>First Lady Jill Biden came on air with a special message about pet love as Commander, the Bidens' young German Shepherd pup, looked on. Commander did not participate in the puppy games, but he certainly was excited to speak to the rest of his canine citizens!</p><p>The theme of Commander's appearance was all about love and how the Puppy Bowl's 18-year history had included so many dogs finding the homes and nurturing they deserved. As this year's bowl coincided with Valentine's Day Weekend, it's no wonder these puppies could give us so many warm fuzzies. </p><h2> There Were Some High Scorers </h2><p>Ellington, a Siberian Husky/ Chow Chow mix, ended up scoring twice for Team Ruff. </p><p>Ellington wasn't the only one with his head in the game! Ted. D. Bear, the golden doodle, was another standout for Team Ruff, making THREE touchdowns of the game!</p><p>On Team Fluff, there was Kirby, a labrador retriever who ""had a real eye for the ball"" and whose big and bright spirit earned him double touchdowns that put Fluff back on the map to win.</p><p>Kirby is beloved and also the Houston Texans' service pup in-training, which made him a solid choice for MVP and for the Pupularity award.</p><h2> Team Ruff Held the Lead </h2><p>For a while, Ruff had a solid advantage and looked like they'd take home the ""Lombarky"" trophy. The score was 66-62, with Ruff ahead of Fluff for even the last moments of the game, but that didn't last.</p><h2> The Kitten Bowl Halftime Was Worth the Watch </h2><p>Cat lovers got a treat as the halftime show of kittens playing charmed viewers nationwide. With a castle, a lifeguard sign, confetti, and a volleyball court among the toy selection, it's a mystery how the Puppy Bowl players could restrain themselves from going to meet some new feline friends!</p><h2> There Was Sibling Roughhouse Time </h2><p>For sisters Bimini and Tayce, the competition will definitely continue off the field too.</p><h2> Ultimately, Team Fluff Took Home the Victory </h2><p>By the end of the game, with minutes left, it was a showdown of Chorizo versus Odell. But a sneak touchdown from Fluff gave the team the 4-point advantage they needed to become the champions!</p><p>The win resulted in a lot of well-earned celebration.</p><h2> This Was the Biggest Puppy Bowl Yet </h2><p>Every year, the Puppy Bowl has been a great way to advertise pups in need of homes. This year had the most participants, with over 100 pups in the game from shelters all over the country from each state, including Hawaii.</p><p>Be sure to tune in next year for more paw-sitively adorable games. </p>",935
19,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guide-to-collapsing-dog-crate-5217086,Dogs > Getting Started,"<h1>A Guide to Buying, Setting Up, and Collapsing a Dog Crate</h1>","<h1>A Guide to Buying, Setting Up, and Collapsing a Dog Crate</h1><p>A crate is an excellent tool to use during puppyhood and beyond. Dogs enjoy den-like spaces, which keep them warm and help them feel safe. A crate provides a safe place for your puppy or dog to sleep or rest. Since dogs don't like to eliminate where they sleep, crates are great to use for potty training. They are also a convenient place to keep your puppy out of trouble when you can't watch him like a hawk. Crates are also helpful for traveling, serving as both a secure place to travel in the car and a safe place to sleep at night in a hotel or at a friend's house. </p><p>When choosing a dog crate, consider size and style. Your needs will be different depending on the age of your dog and your intended use for the crate. </p><h3> Crate Styles </h3><p>Dog crates are generally plastic, wire or canvas. Plastic dog crates are lightweight, durable, and easy to clean. Wire dog crates are also durable and easy to clean, but wire crates are heavy because they are made of metal. Wire crates stay cooler than plastic ones; they offer lots of airflow, but they are less ""den-like"" and are exposed on all sides. Dog crates made of canvas and mesh are lightweight and provide a little more privacy than wire dog crates. They can, however, be difficult to clean if your dog has an accident inside. </p><p>If you're getting a crate for potty training a puppy, chose one that's easy to clean. If you want a crate for traveling, look for a lightweight crate or one that collapses and folds. If you want a crate for an older, potty-trained dog to sleep or rest in, almost any style will do. </p><h3> Crate Size </h3><p>A crate used for pottytraining should be just big enough for the puppy to stand up, turn around and lie down. And larger and the puppy can poop or pee in one end and then sleep at the other end, defeating the purpose. Some crates come with dividers that allow you to section off a smaller space when the puppy is little and gradually increase the size. </p><p>For an adult dog, choose a crate that's at least big enough so your dog can stand up, turn around and lie down. It's OK if it's a little bigger than that so you dog has more space to stretch out, but if the crate's too big it might lose its den-like appeal. </p><h3> Where to Put a Dog Crate </h3><p>If you have just one crate, keep it in a quiet spot in the living room or kitchen during the day so your dog is comforted by your nearby presence. Move it to your bedroom at night so you hear your dog if it needs to be let out to go potty or if it's sick. You might consider purchasing two crates-one for daytime use and one that stays in the bedroom for nighttime sleep.</p><h3> How to Set Up a Dog Crate </h3><p>Plastic dog crates usually come fully assembled. You may need to attach the door or secure the top to the bottom-a process that is simple to do by following the manufacturer's instructions. Wire dog crates generally come fully collapsed and may require assembly. Canvas crates may arrive folded, but they are easy to set up. Always follow the included manufacturer's instructions to set up your crate. If your crate did not come with instructions, visit the manufacturer's website to email or call and ask for the instructions.</p><p>Once your crate is assembled and ready, make it a comfortable and cozy space for your dog. Place a crate pad (cushion) or soft blanket in the bottom and add a few of your dog's favorite toys. If the crate is more open like a wire crate, you may wish to drape a blanket, sheet, or towel over the top to make it darker, quieter, and warmer for your dog. </p><h3> How to Collapse a Dog Crate </h3><p>Wire crates and some canvas crates collapse and fold flat for storage or travel. Plastic crates can be dissembled so the top and bottom half come apart, but these types of crates do not fold flat. </p><p>Every crate is a little different, so always follow the instructions that came with your crate. If you no longer have the instructions, or if your crate didn't come with them, call the manufacturer or visit their website to get specific instructions for collapsing your crate. </p><p>Most crates have tabs or latches that allow you to separate the crate sides from the top and bottom of the crate. Plastic crates have latches or screws; undo these to separate the top from the bottom. When collapsing a crate, always remove the crate pad, blankets, toys and anything else in the crate before breaking down the crate.</p><h3> Using a Crate Properly  </h3><p>Crates should never be used to house a puppy or dog all day long. Young puppies can stay in a crate for short periods of time during the day-generally one hour for every month of age-but need to be let out to go potty, eat, drink and play. Older dogs can stay in a crate for longer periods, but never leave any dog in a crate longer than six hours. Puppies and dogs can sleep in the crate overnight, but keep the crate in your room so you can hear your pup and let them out if they need to go potty in the middle of the night. </p>",919
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/approaching-a-shy-scared-dog-1117432,Dogs > Getting Started,"<h1>How to Approach a Fearful, Shy, or Aggressive Dog</h1>","<h1>How to Approach a Fearful, Shy, or Aggressive Dog</h1><p>Dogs communicate fear and aggression through their body language, showing signs such as shivering, cowering, tucking their tail between the legs, and averting their eyes. In addition, dogs often show aggression when they are afraid. While you might want to know how to get an aggressive dog to trust you, that's not always possible-sometimes it's best to leave the dog alone.</p><p>Be extremely careful as you approach a shy, fearful, or aggressive dog because your own body language and demeanor are important, too. If you see signs that indicate the dog may bite, do not approach. In these cases, it's best to find the owner or contact local animal authorities. If you think it's safe, you can use a few tactics to approach the dog.</p><h2> Don't Loom Over the Dog </h2><p>A dog who is already anxious might get even more stressed if you stand to face it with your body looming above. It's easy to imagine why a fearful dog would feel even more threatened when faced with someone at least twice their size. Be aware of your body position when you approach any new dog, especially one that is frightened.</p><h2> Get Down on the Dog's Level </h2><p>A better way to approach a fearful dog is to get down on its level. Don't put yourself directly in the dog's face, but keep in mind that you'll be less threatening if you're not towering above. You can squat or sit down close to the dog. For extremely fearful dogs, you may even want to lie down a little distance away to begin making it more comfortable with your presence.</p><h2> Turn Sideways </h2><p>Turn slightly so your side faces the dog, perhaps even leaning slightly away from the fearful dog. This isn't a natural position for most people; good manners usually dictate that we meet others face-to-face and make eye contact. For dogs, however, that sort of behavior is rude, and a fearful dog may perceive someone facing them head-on as a threat.</p><h2> Avert Your Gaze </h2><p>Humans usually consider it normal to make direct eye contact with other people. However, this is often considered rude, threatening, or even aggressive to dogs. To make yourself less intimidating to a frightened dog, avoid making eye contact. Instead, turn your head slightly to the side and keep your eyes averted.</p><h2> Speak in a High-Pitched Voice </h2><p>Deep, low voices can be daunting to a fearful dog. Try to talk to the dog in a higher-pitched, happy tone of voice. Men may have a little trouble with this; try just speaking more quietly while remaining upbeat. A quiet, reassuring tone of voice can go a long way in making a nervous dog more comfortable.</p><h2> Never Punish a Fearful Dog </h2><p>It may seem obvious, but it must be said: never scold or punish a fearful dog. You will only succeed in making it more fearful. You may also put yourself in danger because, as a dog's anxiety level rises, it becomes more likely to bite. Also, it's best to avoid using aversives when training a fearful dog. In most cases, these can hinder progress and escalate fear.</p><h2> Don't Force Things </h2><p>Give a dog a chance to become comfortable and approach the objects of their fear on their own. Never force the interactions. For instance, if a dog is afraid of men, don't hold its collar while a man approaches and pets it. This will only serve to increase the dog's fear, making it more likely someone will get bit if the dog feels the need to defend itself. Most dogs can be slowly introduced to the objects that they fear, but an already frightened dog is typically not ready to face additional challenges.</p><h2> Stay Positive </h2><p>Training can make a big difference in your shy or fearful dog's confidence level. Positive reinforcement dog training has the benefit of allowing you to open the lines of communication with your dog without pushing it beyond its comfort level. You can even start training without asking it to do anything. As your dog learns more and becomes more confident, many of its fears will decrease or even fade away.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>While the tips above will help you deal with a dog that is anxious and upset, you may also want to help your own pet overcome specific fears. Try gently exposing your dog to an object or person it fears from a safe distance (one that does not provoke fear in your dog). Act like it is no big deal and slowly inch closer. Stop advancing if your dog shows any signs of fear. You may even need to take a step back.</p><p>Offer your dog praise or gently hand it treats anytime it does something you like, such as walking towards an object or person it's afraid of. With time, your dog will begin to better understand what you expect from it and realize that it will be rewarded for doing those things. The dog will also begin to gain confidence and offer those behaviors more frequently.</p><p>Try this process every day or two for about 10 minutes at a time. Depending on the level of your dog's fear, you may need several sessions to see a difference. Be patient and don't give up.</p>",873
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/indoor-activities-for-your-dog-1118380,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>7 Things to Do With Dogs Indoors</h1>,"<h1>7 Things to Do With Dogs Indoors</h1><h2>Bond with your dog when you can't go outside</h2><p>You don't have to let bad weather spoil your day with your dog. Rainy days, snowstorms or extremes in temperature can get in the way of plans to go outside with your dog and play fetch, run in the park or just spend time together outdoors. With nothing to do, your dog can become restless or bored and begin to act out for attention. Fortunately, there are some indoor activities that can strengthen the bond between you and your dog, stimulate your dog's mind and sometimes even provide some light exercise. It might take some creativity, but the end result will make it worth your time. Here are some indoor activities for you and your dog.</p><h2>Practice Training</h2><p>Anytime is a good time to run through training sessions, but if you are stuck indoors it's the perfect opportunity to work on basic commands or even more advanced ones that don't take up a lot of space. Even if your dog knows the commands well, a training session is still exciting and fun for your dog.</p><p>If you want to step it up a bit, work on teaching fun tricks, like balancing a treat on the nose or rolling over. You may even be able to help your dog to learn the names of his toys, then send him to get them. The possibilities are endless.</p><h2>Play Tug-of-War</h2><p>You only need a little bit of open space to play a game of tug-of-war indoors. This activity can provide some exercise to both you and your dog, especially if you both really get into it.</p><p>Before playing tug-of-war indoors, make sure there are no dangerous or breakable items in the vicinity. Allow several feet of open space around the play area. Make sure that your dog has been trained to understand a release command. Now you're all set to enjoy a fun game of tug with your dog. </p><h2> Set up a Treat Hunt </h2><p>Here's a game that allows your dog to do two of his favorite things: sniffing and eating. To set up the treat hunt, first, make sure your dog is out of sight (in a separate room or in his crate). Gather some great-smelling treats that you know your dog loves. Hide the treats strategically around the house in places your dog can find them. Make sure these are places that are safe for your dog to access and not likely to become damaged. Try putting treats behind doors, next to furniture, under pillows, or in corners of the rooms. You can also hide treats under boxes, paper cups, or even your dog's toys.</p><p>Once it's all set up, let your dog out. He may immediately smell the hidden treats and start searching. It's more likely that you will need to guide him to the res where the treats are and encourage him to search. This makes it a fun activity for both of you.</p><h2>Try Indoor Fetch</h2><p>Leah Flores / Stocksy</p><p>Who says fetch is only an outdoor game? Many dogs love to play fetch. While your dog won't be able to run across a field, you can still give him a little exercise. Indoor fetch works best in a long hallway or on stairs. It's safer on carpeting or another grippy surface so your dog does not slip or slide. Make sure to clear away fragile or dangerous items first. Then, find a ball that is soft enough to toss indoors and go for it!</p><h2> Enjoy Interactive Games and Toys </h2><p>Interactive toys are excellent for sharpening your pet's mind while also rewarding him. These toys usually involve hidden treats in an object. It requires some skill to get to the food, so your dog needs to figure out how the toy works to get to the goodies.</p><p>Products like Kong toys and Everlasting Treat Balls can be stuffed with treats or soft food. With both of these, your dog will need to lick, chew and even throw the toy to get the food out. Also, Nina Ottosson Games like the Dog Tornado are unique puzzle games that contain compartments for food. Your dog must explore the toy to find the treats. Interactive toys can provide hours of entertainment for your dog.</p><h2>Do Some Basic Grooming</h2><p>Dog grooming is one of your dog's basic needs and an important part of dog ownership. In order to make grooming a positive experience, ease your dog into it and offer plenty of rewards. Some dogs really enjoy certain aspects of grooming, especially being brushed.</p><p>If your dog is a shedder, then some basic grooming with a tool like the FURminator can really help cut down on the excess hair in your home. When done in a gentle manner, grooming can be a soothing and enjoyable bonding experience for you and your dog.</p><h2> Watch Movies For Dogs </h2><p>Yes, that's right. There are movies and TV programs designed especially for dogs. Dogs do not quite see television the way we do, but there are some dogs that seem to recognize the movement on the screen and become very excited. Some dogs will not respond at all to images on the screen. However, the sounds coming from the TV can be heard by most dogs and might interest your dog. It might be worth a try to see if your dog enjoys watching.</p>",870
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/four-dog-leash-varieties-1118610,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>5 Types of Dog Leashes</h1>,"<h1>5 Types of Dog Leashes</h1><h2>Choosing the Right Leash for Your Dog</h2><p>The only dog supplies more important than collars are leashes. A leash, or lead, is an essential tool for every dog owner. Leashes are used in conjunction with collar or harnesses for training and everyday purposes.</p><p>When you first begin to use a leash on your dog, it might take some time for your dog to get used to it. This will take patience on your part, especially if you are a first-time dog owner. Your dog needs to learn that the leash connects the two of you. Eventually, your dog will associate the leash with happy things, like going for walks.</p><p>Some dog owners prefer to have several types of dog leashes to use for different purposes. One leash may be for daily walks and another may be for hiking with your dog in the mountains or for bike rides. You may have a certain kind of leash you use specifically for dog training.</p><p>There are so many dog leash styles and designs that it can be difficult to decide what you actually need. Your best bet is to choose something that is functional and fits your personal style. How many dog leashes do you need? Which types are right for you? Use this information to help you find the best leash for your dog.</p><h2> Standard Leashes </h2><p>Standard leashes are intended for basic training and everyday use. They have a loop handle at one end and a metal clip at the other end to attach to your dog's collar. Typically available in lengths from 4-8 feet, the 6-foot length is ideal for most dogs. </p><p>Standard leashes are most commonly made out of nylon and are flat. Flat leashes come in various widths, usually getting wider and thicker for larger and stronger dogs. Leather leashes are considered more durable and some feel they are more stylish. Rope leashes are usually round instead of flat and very durable (ideal for very strong or giant dogs). Some standard leashes are made with chain. These can be useful for dogs who try to chew the leash, but they are also heavier.</p><h2> Retractable Leashes </h2><p>Retractable leashes contain a nylon band or cord of up to 26 feet that retracts into a plastic case with a handle. The leash can lock in place at any length. The mechanism is similar to that of a measuring tape.</p><p>Retractable leashes can be helpful if you want to allow your dog to wander away from you without letting your dog off-leash. However, these leashes should only be used after your dog has been trained to walk on a regular leash. Otherwise, you will teach your dog a very bad habit: that it is permissible to pull on the leash. </p><p>Do not let your dog out of your sight when on the leash, especially at longer lengths. The leash could become tangled or your dog could get into a hazardous situation. Also, be sure to periodically check along the entire length of your retractable leash for frayed, worn, or otherwise damaged areas.</p><p>There are many companies that make retractable leashes, but Flexi is among the most popular.</p><h2> Adjustable Leashes </h2><p>Adjustable or multi-function dog leashes are similar to standard leashes, but they have several loops along the leash that allow a clasp to shorten or lengthen the leash. The various sizes can be useful during certain kinds of dog training.</p><p>You may want to use an adjustable leash to wrap your dog's leash around your waist or body. This is common for those who like to run with their dogs. Be careful to only do this is your dog is well-trained.</p><p>Adjustable leashes can make it easy to briefly tether your dog to a pole or similar object. Just remember that your dog should not be left unattended white tethered.</p><p>When choosing an adjustable leash, find one that is well-made and has the right length (more is often better, but not too much).</p><h2> Slip Leads for Dogs </h2><p>Slip leads are all-in-one collars and leashes. The leash loops onto itself and goes over the dog's head. Some versions have plastic tube slides down the lead to help keep the collar in place. If you or your dog pulls on the leash, the collar part will tighten. This can be dangerous if used improperly, since it can close off your dog's airway if it gets pulled too tightly. Also be aware that your dog may be able to loosen the area around the neck and slip out. Use caution when walking a dog on a slip lead.</p><p>It's important for a dog to wear a separate collar with identification when using a slip lead. This way, if he does slip the leash, he will still have something on to help identify him. </p><p>Many people use slip leads for training purposes, though some like them for everyday use as well. </p><h2> Dog Leashes With Special Features </h2><p>There are several leashes made with a combination of features. Some standard leashes have special grip handles. Certain adjustable leashes have elastic or springs in them to help absorb the shock of a pulling dog. There are leashes with reflective strips for nighttime walking or running. Some leashes are even equipped with flashlights, built-in waste bag holders. </p><h3>Watch Now: 12 Giant Dog Breeds and What Makes Them Special</h3>",869
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/make-picking-up-dog-poop-more-bearable-5084483,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>6 Ways to Make Picking Up Dog Poop More Bearable</h1>,"<h1>6 Ways to Make Picking Up Dog Poop More Bearable</h1><p>Dealing with your dog's waste is definitely one of the less glamorous parts of pet parenting. But it's got to get done, so you may as well make it as tolerable as possible, right?</p><p>While the plastic bag has long reigned supreme as the picker-upper of choice, it's not the only option available when it comes to waste removal. If you'd rather keep your distance-or just outsource the task entirely-you can do so, thanks to some interesting products and services.</p><p>Do keep in mind that, however you do it, it's important to always pick up your dog's poop. Dog waste is both a human health hazard and an environmental pollutant, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and if you leave it (or worse, bury it) it can make its way into the water supply. With that in mind, here are six ways to scoop the poop that require minimal effort to get the job done. </p><h2> Keep a Waste Bag Container on Your Leash </h2><p>Instead of having to remember to bring a bag along every time your dog goes out, get a waste bag container that you can keep right on your pup's leash. This way, you can guarantee that you'll always have bags on hands, and you'll also know when you're about to run out.</p><p>As for the bags themselves, look for biodegradable varieties made from corn, which are produced using tougher standards than ones made from petroleum. This should help you feel a bit better about sending your dog's waste to the landfill. </p><h2> Use a Pooper Scooper </h2><p>Pooper scoopers are a great choice for anyone who wants to keep their distance from their dog's waste, or who has physical limitations that make bending over to pick up poop a difficult task. They're also a good option if you wait a day or two in between backyard pick-ups since you can easily go around and collect waste without having to use multiple plastic bags.</p><p>From there, you probably won't want to just toss the waste in your normal garbage can. Keep a separate can with a bag in your yard or garage where you can deposit the waste, then tie up the bag on garbage day to have it picked up with everything else. </p><h2> Do a Daily Pick-Up </h2><p>The more often you pick up your dog's poop, the less of a hassle it becomes. You obviously need to pick up every time your dog does his business if you're out and about, but in your own yard, it's easy to let a lot of time pass in between tackling this to-do. This can often make it seem a lot harder to manage than it actually is. It also reduces that chances that your dog will make a mess, or that you'll miss a pile and end up stepping in an unwelcome surprise later on.</p><h2> Flush It </h2><p>Another option if you're using a pooper scooper: flush the waste instead of sending it to a landfill. The EPA endorses this method, since the waste water will go to your municipal water treatment plant where it will be treated to remove most of its harmful pollutants.</p><p>Do double check with your local water treatment plant before doing this, since some systems aren't designed to handle this type of waste. And don't flush the waste in a bag unless it's a bag designed to be flushable (and in the latter case, make sure your septic system can handle the extra material). </p><h2> Freeze It </h2><p>No, we're not advising you make some DIY poop-sicles. At least, not exactly. Certain aerosol sprays are designed to freeze dog waste upon contact, which can make a pile of poop a lot easier to pick up. This method has other benefits too, including reducing-or even eliminating-the smell. You'll still need to pick up the poop, but it won't be such a  sensory experience. </p><h2> Outsource the Job </h2><p>Just as you might pay someone to do any other job you don't like, such as washing your car or packing up your house for a move, you can also pay someone to take over poop pick-up duties. Professional dog waste removal companies have been popping up all over the place, providing a reliable and totally hands-off approach for those who are willing to shell out the cash.</p><p>So how do they work? Most of these companies offer service packages where you choose to have them come by once a week, twice a week, or on some other pre-determined time period. The more often you'll need them to come by (and the more dogs that you have), the more you can expect to pay.</p><p>You front the fee and provide access to your yard, and in return, you'll get a 100% guarantee that all the poop will be taken care of on your behalf. Not too bad of a deal if it's in your budget. </p><p>Poop happens, but it doesn't have to be a pain in the you-know-what to take care of. Figure out what works best for you, and take solace in the fact that the love you get in return from your furry friend is more than worth a couple poop pick-ups a day. </p>",864
24,https://www.thesprucepets.com/letting-your-dog-roam-free-1118290,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Can I Let My Dog Roam Free?</h1>,"<h1>Can I Let My Dog Roam Free?</h1><p>Have you ever wondered if it's OK to let your dog roam free? You may live in a rural area and see other dogs roaming. Perhaps your dog loves to wander and explore as most dogs do. Maybe your dog always comes back. Why do some people say this is not a good idea?</p><p>Unfortunately, it is neither safe nor appropriate to allow your dog to roam free. But why? Are we just raining on your roaming dog's parade? Read on to discover the unintended consequences of allowing your dog to roam free.</p><h2> Why Dogs Used to Roam Free </h2><p>Many decades ago, it was considered the norm to allow dogs to roam free, especially in rural areas. Back then, there were fewer cars on the road. Dogs were less often considered members of the family as they are today. Many dogs lived on table scraps and slept outside; it was just the way life was. The life expectancy of dogs was much shorter back then. Many dogs that like to roam are often not spayed or neutered, and this has led to many unwanted and stray dogs that ended up being euthanized.</p><p>These days, we have a better idea of the risks. Veterinary medicine has advanced, and most people think of their dogs as essential members of the family. While roaming the countryside and exploring the world is loads of fun for most dogs, it is simply not safe. Whether you live in an isolated rural area or just a quiet neighborhood where everyone lets their dogs run loose, free-roaming dogs lead to trouble.</p><h2> Why It's Not Safe to Let Your Dog Roam Free </h2><h3> Vehicles </h3><p>Even the most isolated road has a car or truck pass by occasionally. You may say your dog never crosses the road, but there's no telling when that can change. He may see an animal on the other side or wander into the street uncharacteristically. Dogs that have been hit by cars account for a very high percentage of pets entering veterinary emergency clinics. Many of these dogs do not survive.</p><h3> Infectious Diseases </h3><p>While exploring, your dog can come across disease-carrying substances from animal feces, urine, dead wildlife, and even other living animals. Rabies is a fatal disease to dogs and people, and wildlife like bats, skunks and foxes are often sources of this fatal disease. Leptospirosis is a bacteria that can cause liver and kidney failure and is spread by wildlife urine. Some algae on ponds can cause serious illness in dogs. Dogs are opportunistic scavengers that instinctively eat what they find appealing. Sometimes this can lead to severe gastrointestinal upset and infection with things like salmonella or e.coli.</p><h3> Parasites </h3><p>Parasites include worms, fleas and ticks, and all of these parasites can cause severe illness. Your dog will most likely encounter several of these parasites if left to roam. Ticks can cause serious blood-borne illnesses like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Ehrlichia. Fleas can cause anemia, severe skin infections and tapeworms. Intestinal parasites like hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, giardia and coccidia are all common in the environment and the chance of your dog being exposed to one or all of these increases if it is left to roam. Again, your dog may eat whatever he finds appealing and ingest a parasite in the process. Many of these parasites can cause your dog to become sick, often beginning with decreased energy and appetite. You may never notice this until the complications are serious.</p><h3> Injury to or From Other Animals </h3><p>Dogs are predatory creatures by nature. They may chase and attack wildlife and other pets. While it is a shame for local wildlife to be harmed, it is even more tragic for someone else's pet or livestock to be injured or even killed. If your pet is responsible for injury or death to an animal owned by another, you would most likely be held responsible for the cost of the care of the pet, or the monetary value of the animal that was lost. On the flip side, an aggressive or defensive animal (domesticated or wild) might injure or kill your dog.</p><h3> Disturbing Other People </h3><h3> Legal Consequences </h3><p>Many areas have leash laws, meaning you could be fined for allowing your dog to roam free. In some cases, your dog could even be taken from you.</p><h3> Lost or Stolen </h3><p>Your dog may wander too far one day and never make it back. People may think your free-roaming dog is a stray. Someone may take him to the pound or keep him for themselves. Your dog could even be knowingly stolen by a malicious or greedy person.</p><p>As much as your dog might love to run, you are doing the dog and your community a disservice but allowing this. Instead, get out there and exercise with your dog. Build a fence for your yard or bring your dog to a large enclosed field or meadow to play. Consider visiting a dog park if your dog can play nicely. Please be a responsible dog owner and keep your dog from wandering around your community.</p>",844

Or maybe they tear apart every plush toy you've ever given them, but for some reason, they worship the stuffed jack-o-lantern you got them three Octobers ago?</p><p>My corgi, Charlotte, is like that with a $4 blue latex squeaky dog that my fiance and I call Tom. Forget the antlers, the interactive puzzles, and the treat dispensing toys we've spent a fortune on-Charlotte has eyes for only Tom. She interacts with Tom almost conversationally; she squeaks him a few times, then makes these pining moans and whines in response. It's intimate. She also likes to parade Tom around the room and show him to whomever will look. It's a joy to witness.</p><p>For whatever reason, our pets become fixated with certain toys. Like our favorite childhood blankets, some toys or objects are just special in our pets' eyes, and us owners get the pleasure of watching their giddy, whimsical, and protective reactions.</p><p>Here are some of our favorite stories of pets and their special friends.</p><h2> The Blanket Buddy </h2><p>Ayanna Allyne</p><p>""My two crazy pups Baxter, a 5-year-old brindle pitbull, and Ollie, a 1-year-old pitbull mix, have some unusual but adorable obsessions. For Baxter, it's soft blankies. Literally any blanket he can get his mouth and paws on, he will start kneading away like he's some kind of cat making biscuits. It's the sweetest, most precious thing to watch. 15/10 precious doggo. And Ollie is obsessed with anything that Baxter is obsessed with."" -Ayanna Allyne</p><h2> The Special Hedgehog Friend </h2><p>Mary Schrott</p><p>""There is only one fluff-filled toy that Copper, my 2-year-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, has left fully stuffed and respected-Hedge. Hedge is a stuffed hedgehog toy the size of a basketball that Copper rendezvous with every night at 9 p.m., when he levitates onto my bed for an intense 10-minute hump-fest. Like clockwork, Hedge and Copper have their special 9 p.m. moment every night where they unwind together after a long, hard day of napping."" -Mary Schrott</p><h2> A Squirrel-Friend for Life </h2><p>Jillian Ertel</p><p>""My 8-year-old mutt, Manny, might not be able to catch neighborhood squirrels on his walks, but he sure loves to catch his favorite toy, Mr. Squirrel. We like to hide Mr. Squirrel under blankets to give Manny a challenge, and once he finds him, he makes sure we know by squeaking him over and over."" -Jillian Ertel</p><h2> A Friend as Old as Time </h2><p>Cody Mello-Klein</p><p>""My dog, Feta, is equitable when it comes to his toys. Basically, he loves every toy he gets and destroys them almost immediately, but one that has stuck around longer than almost any other is this green dinosaur toy. At least it used to be a green dinosaur toy-now it's just a deflated, shapeless green mess, but he still loves it. We got it from a neighbor who was giving away some toys in a bin in front of their house. We were on a walk, saw the bin, and Feta immediately made a beeline to the dino toy. He grabbed it and carried it in his mouth all the way back to our apartment. The toy doesn't have a name-it doesn't even have a face anymore-but he still gets excited every time he sees it."" -Cody Mello-Klein</p><h2> The Cocoon Compadre </h2><p>Sarah Timko</p><p>""My cat Earl's favorite toy is Mr. Caterpillar-a rainbow striped caterpillar that's attached to a wand. The first time he played with Mr. Caterpillar, he was so excited that he held the toy in his mouth and growled-at no one in particular, but just to warn everyone that this was toy. Since then, Earl likes to drag Mr. Caterpillar across the living room and place him on my lap for me to wave around while he chases and pounces on it. We play with this toy so much that he's now on his third Mr. Caterpillar."" -Sarah Timko</p><h2> The (Literally) Big Three </h2><p>Cait Knoll</p><h2> Eight Days of Friendship </h2><p>Rachael Friedman</p><p>""My pug, Peanut, is obsessed with any kind of crinkle toy.

As a 4-year-old rescued pitbull mix, he makes an unlikely hunting dog, but Duke's beloved ""Squirr"" toy-now completely devoid of any stuffing or squeakers that once filled its insides-would beg to differ. Duke even insists on conducting squirrel-catching training sessions, during which he relentlessly chases Squirr around our tiny apartment. I feel like he's training in case we encounter a deadly, dangerous squirrel on one of our morning runs."" -Emily Larrabee </p><p>Please remember to only give your dogs toys that are safe for them, and consult your veterinarian if you have a question about a new toy before you give it to your pup.</p>",846
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/things-only-dog-owners-understand-4141245,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>12 Things Only Dog Owners Understand</h1>,"<h1>12 Things Only Dog Owners Understand</h1><p>Dogs have many characteristics that everyone-even those hostile cat owners-are familiar with: they're playful, they're incredibly loyal, they can be beyond goofy and, of course, they're all very good boys.</p><p>There are certain things about dogs, however, that only puppy parents can truly understand. Some of those things are ridiculously adorable and others are downright disgusting, but they all make up the daily joy that is dog ownership.</p><p>Read on to learn about the 12 things that only dog owners really know-and what makes dogs our best friends.</p><h2> Dog Hair Is Literally Everywhere-But You Don't Care </h2><p>After so many years of dog ownership, you learn to accept that every single surface of your home (and every item of clothing in your closet) is covered with a layer of dog hair. Our advice? Stop buying any dark-colored clothing; forget the special vacuum attachment for pet hair (it doesn't work!), and try to ignore the tumbleweeds of dog hair rolling across the living room floor. Just be sure to keep some strategically placed lint rollers around your house.</p><h2> You've Pondered How Their Human Voice Would Sound </h2><p>Don't even deny it: You've spent how much time trying to figure out what your dog's human voice would sound like. Would it be high-pitched? Low and gravelly? Would she speak another language? The possibilities are baffling and endless.</p><h2> How Badly It Hurts When Your Dog Lets Someone Else Pet Him </h2><p>Nothing is more devastatingly heartbreaking than when your dog leaves your side, cozies up to someone else and lets that person pet him instead. Except when he looks across the room to make sure you're watching the betrayal happen.</p><h2> You Haven't Used an Alarm Clock in Years </h2><p>Once you become a dog owner, you can ditch the alarm clock-your dog will wake you up at the same time. Every. Single. Morning. But how would you prefer to wake up? To a loud, jarring, impersonal alarm clock, or a slobbery, happy face that wants nothing more in the world than to take a morning walk with you?</p><h2> The Head Tilt Can Alleviate Any Stressful Situation </h2><p>Not only can your dog's curious, inquisitive and head tilt dissolve any negative emotion or stress you may be feeling, but if we gathered enough dogs and made them tilt their heads simultaneously, we could probably solve many of the world's problems.</p><h2> Your Dog Eats Better Food Than You </h2><p>You'll eat whatever conventional, mass-produced foods are on sale at the grocery store. Your dog eats only organic, non-GMO, gluten and dairy-free whole foods that are produced by a farmer/poet named Gregory in rural Massachusetts.</p><h2> Your Dog's Bed Is Nicer Than Yours </h2><p>You probably have the same mattress you bought right after graduating from college-it's at least 10 years old, lumpy, sagging in the middle and covered with bargain bin linens. Your dog's bed? It's the most advanced, cloud-like memory foam with cooling ridges and made up with 1,000 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets.</p><h2> You Actually Forget You're Picking Up Poop </h2><p>You don't pick up your own poop. You wouldn't pick up a stranger's (or a strange animal's) poop. But we don't hesitate for a second when picking up our dog's poop. Why? Maybe we're just so proud that they learned how to go potty outside  or just trying to help a pupper out 'cause they don't have opposable thumbs.</p><h2> You Want to Skip Vacation to Stay with Them </h2><p>Dogs always seem to know when their owner is going on vacation. Whether they pout around the house or literally climb into your luggage, the guilt a dog owner feels when going on vacation is overwhelming. The worst part? You can't even communicate to them that you promise you'll be back soon, and with special puppy souvenirs. It's almost worth skipping vacation entirely to hang out on the couch with your pooch.</p><h2> You Cancel Plans Because Your Dog Fell Asleep </h2><p>How many times (this month) have you cancelled plans with friends because your dog fell asleep on your arm or leg or foot, and she's just too precious and peaceful to possibly disturb?</p><h2> You're Observed While Going to the Bathroom </h2><p>Dogs love their owners so much, they don't want to be apart from them for a second. And, for dog owners, seeing a pair of paws underneath the bathroom door waiting is too much to bear. The solution? Let the dog into the bathroom, so he can lock eyes and look deep into your soul while you finish your business. Obviously.</p><h2> You Make up New Nicknames for Your Dog Every Day </h2><p>Dog owners put a lot of time into choosing the perfect name for their pet. My family, for example, had a shared spreadsheet of potential names before we picked up our dog, Brodie.</p><p>Dog's nicknames, however, are, essentially, the total breakdown (and annihilation) of the English language. They're often made-up words or sounds, or a combination of the two. Proof: Brodie's nicknames include Brobro, Bat Boy, Brobee, Brah, Snorgie, Poop Boy, Doofy or just howling. I literally just make a howling sound.</p>",826
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/is-chlorine-bad-for-dogs-4689565,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Is Chlorine Bad or Safe for Dogs?</h1>,"<h1>Is Chlorine Bad or Safe for Dogs?</h1><h2>What Dog Owners Should Know</h2><p>Summer is here and it's time to go swimming! Humans are not the only ones who enjoy chilling out in a nice pool when it's hot outside. Many dogs love to cool off, play, and swim in the pool. But what about pool chemicals? Is chlorine bad for dogs? Learn how to make a day at the pool fun and safe for dogs.</p><h2> Is Pool Water Bad For Dogs to Drink? </h2><p>The chlorine level in a properly maintained swimming pool is relatively low and therefore not generally harmful to dogs if they drink small amounts of pool water. Saltwater pools contain chlorine, too, but at lower levels than traditional pools.</p><p>Drinking excess amounts of chlorinated pool water can irritate a dog's gastrointestinal tract, leading to nausea, vomiting, and erosion of the esophagus. The risks are significantly higher if the chlorine level in a pool is too high.</p><p>Occasionally, you may need to do a chemical shock to the pool for sterilization purposes. Make sure your dog is kept away from the pool until the chemical balance is safe for people to swim in again (check your product label).</p><p>Always provide an accessible source of fresh, clean drinking water for your dog so that the pool does not become the primary ""watering hole."" And, remember, most municipal water is chlorinated, so low levels of this chemical have been deemed safe to consume by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).</p><h2> Does Pool Water Hurt Dogs' Skin? </h2><p>While short swimming sessions are generally harmless, too much exposure to chlorine and other pool chemicals can irritate a dog's eyes, skin (including paws), and coat. This is usually more of an issue if the pool is chemically imbalanced or the dog stays in the pool for a very long time.</p><h3> Should I Lower My Pool's Chlorine Level? </h3><p>If you think that reducing the chemicals is a good solution for dog-or human-safety, think again! Improperly treated pool water can harbor a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, algae, fungi, and parasites. These can affect you and your dog via accidental ingestion, inhalation, or contact with skin and mucous membranes. These pathogens are often much more harmful than the level of chlorine used to maintain a sanitary pool.</p><h2> Can Puppies Swim in Chlorine Pools? </h2><p>In terms of chlorinated water safety, puppies share the same basic risks as adult dogs-ingesting too much can potentially cause gastrointestinal upset, and skin irritation is also possible. Due to their smaller size and more delicate skin, puppies can experience these negative effects from pool water more quickly than older dogs, so it's a good idea to limit swim sessions to shorter periods of time and watch for any issues that may arise.</p><p>Pool safety is of utmost importance when allowing pool access to puppies. They are not as experienced in water and are weaker swimmers than adult dogs. A life jacket is a great idea for your budding swimmer; just make sure you have the correct size and do not leave your pup unattended, even in a life jacket.</p><h2> Are Saltwater Pools Better? </h2><p>Drinking excessive water from a saltwater pool can cause dogs the same problems as chlorinated pool water. In addition, consuming too much salt can lead to diarrhea or electrolyte imbalances that can quickly become life-threatening. Fortunately, pool water contains much less salt than the ocean, so it would take a large volume of pool water to be this dangerous.</p><p>Saltwater pools might be slightly gentler on dogs' skin and mucous membranes, but short swimming sessions are still safer than extensive exposure.</p><h3>Rinse Off After Swimming</h3><p>To prevent irritation from chlorine, salt, and other pool chemicals, hose your dog off with fresh water and rinse away residue after swimming in a pool.</p><h2> Pool Safety for Dogs </h2><p>If your dog knows how to swim, then it is generally safe to allow it to swim in the pool.</p><p>If you and your dog are swimming together, watch out for those claws. The motion of a dog's feet while swimming makes its claws more prominent, and some dogs try to hold on to their human friends. A swimming dog can seriously scratch bare skin.</p><h2> How Dogs Affect Your Pool </h2><p>If you plan to let your dog swim in your pool, you will need to consider more than just the dog's safety. Having a dog swim in your pool can negatively affect your pool.</p><p>Many pool maintenance professionals say that the effect of one dog in the pool is equal to that of three people. You can slightly reduce this by brushing out the dog and hosing off the dog with water before the dog enters the pool. However, you will still need extra maintenance to keep the pool clean and safe.</p><p>American Kennel Club.</p><p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Merck Veterinary Manual.</p>",802

There's even a hugely popular Twitter account that gives ratings to these very good boys. Spoiler: Every dog on the account is, in fact, a very good boy and always scores at least 11 out of 10 on the 10-point rating system.</p><p>Still not sure what makes a very good boy? We get it-the internet can be a weird and confusing place. But these 17 dogs being very good boys (and girls!) may make it a little bit easier to understand.</p><h2> Good Boys Are Thoughtful </h2><p>""How long does it take to become a truly good boy?"" wonders Vincent, age 8 weeks. Vincent may be concerned about his good boy status, but with his thoughtful, pensive personality and sweet face, he is clearly on his way to full-blown good boyhood.</p><h2> Good Boys Enjoy Themselves </h2><p>Charlie has spent many, many years behaving like a very good boy.

As a service dog in training, she acts as a companion to US military members and veterans. Thank you for your service, Cadence!</p><h2> Do Yard Work </h2><p>Brodie may not always seem like a very good boy-he digs up of plants to eat mud and then needs a long bath-but trust us: he is a very good boy. What's so wrong with a puppy wanting to help his parents with the lawn care, anyway?</p><h2> Study Hard </h2><p>Some studies have shown that dogs understand what their humans are saying when they speak dog language, especially when we praise them. Winston, the good boy seen here, is hoping to prove those theories right in his ""post-  thesis.</p><h2> Good Boys Are Adventurous </h2><p>Max is a very good boy whose hobbies include scaling mountains by hiking with his owner and conquering the landscapes no pup has conquered before. He's currently training to become a Mount Kilimanjaro climbing guide. </p><h2> Protect the Planet </h2><p>Good boys care about protecting the environment. That's why Maggie, an avid outdoors girl and environmental advocate, always recycles and uses her human's compost in her flower garden. </p><h2> Good Boys Know They're Good Boys </h2><p>You don't have to tell Ava she's a good boy. She already knows it-and loves to bask in its glory. You go, girl. </p><h2> Get Tired Doing Good Things </h2><p>Being a good boy can be so exhausting.

Penny and Hank have been besties since puppyhood. They took this sweet selfie at their last play date in the park and then ate some vanilla ice cream.</p><h2> Never Stop Learning </h2><p>Generally, good boys don't put their paws in other dogs' dishes, but we can certainly make an exception for Bailey. She's only a few weeks old, so she's still being trained about the key good boy behaviors.</p><h2> Care About Their Community </h2><p>As a very good boy and upstanding member of his community, Fred shovels his neighbors' driveways for free whenever it snows.

29,https://www.thesprucepets.com/types-of-dog-supplies-1118618,Dogs > Getting Started,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>Essential Gear for Dogs</h1>,"<h1>Essential Gear for Dogs</h1><p>There are so many kinds of pet supplies available for dogs that we may wonder what is really necessary and what is extravagant. Realistically, there are multiple factors that contribute to a happy, healthy life for your dog. You start by meeting your dog's basic needs and practicing responsible dog ownership. Then, you move on to the details, like choosing pet supplies for your dog. To avoid going over the top, you should determine what kinds of pet supplies your dog really needs in order to complete their life. For your consideration, here's a rundown of the top kinds of pet supplies available for dogs today.</p><h2>Dog Collars</h2><p>Every dog should have a collar or harness, period. This collar or harness should ALWAYS be equipped with your dog's current identification tags. Microchips are a great way to supplement identification tags, but they are not acceptable replacements in the event your dog is lost. Beyond identification, collars or harnesses are used with leashes in order to walk and restrain your dog. Plus, they are a great way to show off your dog's personal style (and your own, too)!</p><h2>Dog Leashes</h2><p>Every dog needs a leash, and each should be trained to walk on it. Chances are your dog will be subject to leash laws at one time or another, even if there are no leash laws in your area. You may even want to keep multiple types of leashes around the house for multiple uses. For fun, you can coordinate your dog's leash and collar to maximize style. Then, walk your dog regularly!</p><h2>Dog Beds</h2><p>Your dog should have a special place to go and snuggle up, whether it is an old pillow that is just right, or a specific style of dog bed. Dog beds come in many designs to fit the needs of all kinds of dogs. Try to get a bed for each dog in the house, plus one extra. Or, you could get a larger bed for dogs who like to share.</p><h2>Dog Kennels</h2><p>Dog kennels, or crates, can be a wonderful thing for most dogs. Similar to a dog bed, having a kennel can give your dog a place to retreat and feel secure. Crate training is an integral part of housebreaking and can also play a role in other types of training. Additionally, kennels can really come in handy for travel.</p><h2>Dog Toys</h2><p>There are very few dogs that do not enjoy their toys. Some prefer a nice loud squeaky toy, while others want to play fetch or tug-of-war. Play is an important part of your dog's development. Playing with toys often mimics the activities dogs would perform in the wild, such as chewing or retrieving. Plus, they help keep your dog active and stimulated.</p><h2>Dog Grooming Equipment</h2><p>All dogs need some degree of grooming, a task that requires some equipment. You will need to find grooming tools that suit your dog's overall grooming requirements. Choose brushes, combs, and shampoos based on your  dog's coat type. For some types, you will need hair clippers and scissors. All dogs need nail trims, but the size of your dog will determine the type of nail trimmers needed. Other miscellaneous grooming tools may be helpful depending on your dog's individual needs.</p><h2>Dog Bowls</h2><p>Obviously, food and water are necessary for your dog to survive and remain healthy. Your choice of bowls or dishes is important as well. Plastic bowls may not be ideal for some dogs, while stainless steel bowls are economical and durable. Ceramic bowls come in various designs, adding a little personality to mealtime.</p><h2>Dog Food</h2><p>The type of food you choose give your dog has a major impact your dog's overall health. With so many choices out there, picking out the best foods can be a daunting task. Think twice before you reach for the economy dog food off the grocery shelf  do some research so you can make an educated choice. Finding the best varieties of dog treats is also a part of this process.</p><h2>Preventive Products</h2><p>Just like we need to take good care of ourselves to ward off illness, preventive measures should be taken to protect your dog's health. This may include vitamins and supplements, heartworm prevention, flea prevention and dental care. Your veterinarian will prescribe the appropriate treatments based on your location and your pet's individual needs.</p><h2> Extras </h2><p>Gloria/Flickr CC 2.0 </p><p>There are numerous dog products out there for recreation, protection, or just plain fun. For example, you might choose to get a harness or a seat belt to make car rides safer. Or, your Whippet might need a fleece jacket for freezing winters. Sometimes, you just can't resist buying that cute bow for your Yorkie's hairdo. From clothing to safety devices, the possibilities are endless. Just remember to get what your dog needs first, and what you want second.</p>",795

31,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-dogs-need-winter-coats-4776232,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Should I Put a Winter Coat on My Dog?</h1>,"<h1>Should I Put a Winter Coat on My Dog?</h1><p>As the temperatures drop, dog parents may be wondering whether their dogs need winter coats to stay safe and warm during the frigid season. Not all dogs need a winter coat, and in some cases, the extra layer of warmth can actually do more harm than good. However, under the right conditions, most dogs can benefit from an extra layer of protection from the elements. Find out below when it's safe, and necessary, to put a winter coat on your dog.</p><h2> Why Do People Buy Winter Coats for Their Dogs? </h2><p>Sometimes, the decision to put a winter coat on a dog is purely emotional. Walking your dog in frigid temperatures can be emotionally distressing because of your concern for your dog. Since most dogs require time outside in order to go to the bathroom and release excess energy, it's no surprise that dog owners would take a rather-safe-than-sorry approach.</p><p>Other times, the decision can be driven by fashion. In 2019, the American Pet Products Association reported that $16.01 billion was spent in the last year on pet clothing as well as collars, leashes, toys, and pet tech products-up seven percent from the previous year. As younger generations move from pet ownership to pet parentship, the pet industry is moving toward a more ""humanistic approach,"" prompting brands to offer designer products for pets, including a wider variety of clothing options for dogs.</p><h2> Should You Put a Winter Coat on a Dog? </h2><p>Many factors come into play when determining whether or not you should put a winter coat on your dog. It's important to take into account wind chill, whether or not your dog could get wet, and how sunny it is before taking your dog outside. When in doubt, play it safe. You can always take the coat off if your dog appears to be getting too warm. Any time you're out in the cold and see your dog shivering, seeking out warmth, limping, slowing down, or acting anxious or distressed in any way, it's time to go inside.</p><p>A dog's age, health status, and acclimation to cold temperatures should also be considered. Elderly, very young, and sick dogs can have trouble staying warm even under mild conditions, while a healthy adult dog who is used to the cold can be quite happy even when it's very chilly.</p><h2> Which Dogs Need a Winter Coat? </h2><p>Small dogs have relatively more surface area through which to lose heat than big dogs, so all other things being equal, smaller dogs benefit from coats at higher temperatures than bigger dogs. A few breeds that fit this group are Chihuahuas, toy terriers, and Miniature Pinschers. Body fat helps hold the heat in, so a thin dog, like a Whippet or Greyhound, will often appreciate a coat more than an overweight dog. Dogs with very thin fur can get cold quite easily, so they are typically good contenders for a winter coat.</p><p>On the other hand, large dogs with long or thick hair that have their own thick double coats rarely require a winter coat. In fact, its weight can actually reduce the natural insulating properties of the dog's fur. Dark fur also absorbs more heat from the sun than light fur. Activity generates a lot of heat, so any dog will be warmer when they are running around versus sitting quietly.</p><p>Before choosing to (or not to) put a winter coat on your dog, ask your vet for advice specific to your dog.</p><h2> How to Choose a Winter Coat for a Dog </h2><p>Once you have determined that your dog could use a winter coat-and got approval from your vet-you'll have to decide which type of coat your dog needs. First, consider the type of material your dog's coat should have. Ask your vet for recommendations on materials that are compatible with your dog's fur coat type.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Certain fabrics may cause allergic reactions in some dogs. Keep an eye out for repeated itching, sneezing, hives, swelling of the face, ears, lips, eyelids or earflaps, red and inflamed skin, diarrhea, and/or vomiting.</p><p>Also, consider measuring your dog before purchasing a winter coat, since sizing is dependent on your particular dog. Use a tape measure to record your dog's measurements, which will help determine whether a particular article of clothing will fit. You want to be sure that the coat you choose isn't too tight, loose enough to drag on the ground or fall off your dog, or prevents your dog from moving normally.</p><p>""Americans Are Spending More on Pets Than Ever Before: $72 Billion"" .

32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-old-is-your-dog-in-human-years-4588708,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>How Old Is Your Dog in Human Years?</h1>,"<h1>How Old Is Your Dog in Human Years?</h1><p>Saying one dog year equals seven human years is a very simplified way of comparing the age of a dog to that of a human. This outdated but popular calculation has been around since the mid-20th century. But unfortunately, converting dog years to human years isn't that simple. This seven-human-years-to-one-year-of-age calculation is good, however, at helping people understand that dogs age at a much more rapid rate than humans do. By understanding roughly how old a dog is compared to a human, dog owners can provide the best care possible to their dogs.</p><h2> Age and Dog Size </h2><p>Different sizes of dogs age at different rates, and the rate of aging increases if a dog is bigger and older. Small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas, typically age more slowly while giant breed dogs, such as Great Danes, will age more quickly when compared to dogs of other sizes. This basically means that the larger your dog is when it is full-grown, the quicker its body ages. Larger-breed dogs usually do not live as long as smaller-to-medium-sized dogs, but there are always exceptions.</p><h2> Puppies From Birth to Six Months </h2><p>The development of a dog of any size during the first six months of life is similar. Eyes and ears will open, baby teeth will erupt, and your dog will be weaned off of its mother to eat solid puppy food. Growth plates on bones will still be open which means your dog is still growing during this time of its life.</p><h2> Puppies From Six Months to Three Years Old </h2><p>Dogs reach their full-grown, adult height at different times--usually sometime between 10 months and 18 months of age with smaller individuals reaching the milestone sooner than bigger individuals. Growth plates on bones will close, baby teeth will fall out and adult teeth will erupt, coat changes may occur, and your puppy will become an adult dog. Puppy food is usually transitioned to adult food once your dog has completed growing.</p><p>The first year of a dog's life is equivalent to between 14 and 18 years for a person, so big changes occur. By age two, most dogs can be considered to be in their mid-twenties in human years.</p><h2> Dogs From Three to Six Years Old </h2><p>Between three and six years of age, most dogs age at a fairly steady rate regardless of size with every human year corresponding to approximately four dog years. So, a three year old dog is in their late twenties, a four year old dog is in their early thirties, and a five year old dog is in their mid to late thirties.</p><p>Dogs are in their prime for these few years. Energy levels may have plateaued when compared to a puppy but injuries are more common during this prime age since they are typically more active than a senior dog. Most dogs are fairly healthy during these years, but giant-sized dogs may start acting more like a senior and have some health issues as they approach five to six years of age.</p><h2> Senior Dogs </h2><p>The age ranges of a senior dog will vary depending on the size of the dog, but senior dogs are typically considered to be over seven years of age. Giant dogs may be considered senior as young as five years of age, though. Starting at the age of six, determine how old your dog is in human by multiplying their chronological age by 5.5 if they are a small breed dog, 6 if they area a medium breed dog, 6.5 if they are a large breed dog, and 7.5 if they are a giant breed dog.</p><p>Senior dogs require more regular health monitoring when compared to younger dogs so that any signs of disease can be caught early. Check-ups with your veterinarian may be recommended every six months instead of annually due to how quickly dogs age.</p><h2> Geriatric Dogs </h2><p>Once a dog reaches double digits, it may be classified as geriatric, but smaller dogs may not reach this classification until they reach 14 years of age since they tend to live longer than larger breeds. It is not as common to have a giant-sized dog live into the double digits as it is a small dog.</p><p>Geriatric dogs of any size are prone to developing many different age-related conditions. Just like in people, difficulty walking and jumping can be the result of arthritis and different organs may not work well and require medical support. At a minimum, check-ups with your veterinarian should be done every six months, but more often may be preferable.</p><p>Why Do Small Dogs Live Longer Than Big Dogs?</p><p>Senior Pet Care.</p>",772
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/adaptil-pheromone-collar-for-dogs-3384526,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Adaptil Collar for Dogs</h1>,"<h1>Adaptil Collar for Dogs</h1><h2>What Are Pheromones?</h2><p>Adaptil</p><p>You may have heard of or seen Adaptil for dogs at your vet's office or online-touting the promise of calm in a collar and thought, ""What are these, and do they really work?"" The short answer is that, yes, they can help in a variety of situations-but they may not be enough for every dog. Stress and anxiety can arise from multiple reasons in dogs; meeting new people, thunderstorms, being left alone, or even just being adopted and going into a new home can be a stressful situation for our pup pals.</p><h3>What is an Adaptil Collar?</h3><p>Adaptil collars are pheromone collars that can help reduce stress and anxiety in dogs and puppies. They are often activated by a dog's body heat and most can be worn up to 30 days before having to be replaced.</p><h2> What Is a Pheromone? </h2><p>Pheromones are chemical compounds that animals naturally produce and release into the environment. When the pheromone is perceived by another member of that species it triggers a behavioral response. Essentially, pheromones are the silent and instant carrier pigeons of information. Because these chemical compounds are so specialized, they are unique to each species. Pheromones influence behaviors in a variety of ways depending on the pheromone type. Some pheromones signal reproductive status, give a warning to others to stay away, or even send an alarm signal. Appeasing pheromones are the ""feel good"" pheromone that is released shortly after an animal gives birth and helps their young as they grow. </p><p>Adaptil, formerly known as DAP (Dog Appeasing Pheromone) is a synthetic version of the canine appeasing pheromone. After giving birth, a female dog will secrete these pheromone compounds around her mammary glands and it is nature's way of comforting the puppies. Despite the wide eyed looks that dogs give off, all puppies are born blind and deaf- a rough start! For the first two weeks of their lives newborn puppies rely exclusively on scent and touch and throughout that time the appeasing pheromone helps to minimize stress that the new puppy will experience. When a puppy crawls away from their mother and litter it can increase their stress and they begin to vocalize distinctly- a puppy SOS! When they return to their littermates and mother they get the reassuring signal via the appeasing pheromone that helps them become calm and relaxed again.</p><h2> Why Use a Pheromone Collar?  </h2><p>Using a pheromone collar provides your dog with a consistent supply of pheromones regardless of time or place. Dogs that have noise phobia, commonly thunderstorms or fireworks, benefit by being surrounded by the appeasing pheromone as we cannot always anticipate when a thunderstorm will happen or when fireworks will be herd. Some dogs may have temporary changes such as being boarded, traveling, or being hospitalized that can cause unintentional stress. During these times the Adaptil collar can add a layer of self assurance to help dogs cope with the changes they may face.</p><p>Puppies that have just started their life with their new families can especially benefit. While it is a one of the happiest days, to bring a puppy home, it can be quite the shock to go from leaving your littermates and mother to having a new family- all in one day! Puppies that used Adaptil during that transitional phase stopped crying at night 66% faster and were 75% less likely to vocalize during the day compared to puppies that did not use Adaptil. Feeling secure also helps puppies learn better during their early months in training classes, setting them up to be balanced adults. </p><p>Each Adaptil collar is adjustable but needs to be fitted to your dog snugly. To ensure a proper fit you want no more than two fingers width between the collar and your dogs neck. The dogs body heat will help to diffuse the pheromones into the air around him or her. </p><h2> The Pros </h2><h2> The Cons: </h2><p>As always, never shy from advocating for your dog to their veterinarian. Vets dedicate their days to making sure our pets can stay happy and healthy for as many years possible, that includes making sure their mental welfare is addressed. Veterinary professionals, veterinary behaviorists, and certified positive reinforcement trainers can help you teach your pup skills to make them more confident and feel more secure in a variety of situations. Like most things in life, slow and steady wins the race for positive changes. </p>",727

36,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-too-hot-for-dogs-3975543,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>How Hot Is Too Hot for Dogs?</h1>,"<h1>How Hot Is Too Hot for Dogs?</h1><p>When summer approaches, it's natural for people to want to spend more time outside with their family, friends, and pets. But sometimes, the heat can be too much. People may wear less clothing and more breathable fabrics to prevent becoming overheated outside, but dogs aren't able to shed their fur in order to stay cool. It's important for dog owners to know when it's too hot for their dog to be outside, as well as to recognize the signs of overheating. Heatstroke is a serious concern in dogs and can lead to death if ignored. It's best to take precautions whenever possible.</p><h2> What Temperature Is Too Hot for Dogs? </h2><p>Just like some people, some dogs can adjust to being exposed to higher temperatures over time but if it is over 77 degrees Fahrenheit outside, you should be thinking about whether or not your dog is affected by the heat. Pavement temperatures can be much hotter than the air if in direct sunlight with no wind and low humidity, so foot pad burns can occur even if the air doesn't feel that hot. The pavement can be 40-60 degrees hotter than the air temperature, so standing on ground this hot can cause burns in 60 seconds.</p><p>If the ground temperature isn't your concern, anything that is higher than a dog's body temperature short-term can be problematic. Since a dog's body temperature is normally between 100 and 103 degrees, this means that temperatures over 100 degrees can quickly cause problems for your dog, even if they are just sitting outside in the sun. But if it is cooler than 100 degrees and there is high humidity, this can also be a problem, since the humidity prevents a dog from being able to efficiently cool itself through panting. High humidity and temperatures in the 80s or 90s can cause issues if your dog is outside in the sun for lengthy amounts of time, especially if it is exercising.</p><p>All in all, the more humid it is, the lower the heat has to be to negatively affect your dog. Your dog may be able to withstand hotter temperatures and higher humidity if it is just sitting outside, but if you are going on a walk or run, you'll need to closely monitor whether or not your dog is getting too hot. If it's too hot for you to comfortably stand in the sun, then it's definitely too hot for your dog.</p><h2> How to Tell If Your Dog Is Too Hot </h2><p>Since there is no hard and fast rule regarding how hot is too hot for your dog, you should be well versed in how to tell if your dog is overheating. Excessive panting, drooling, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, increased thirst, and bright red gums and tongue are the first signs that your dog is too hot. As their body temperature continues to rise, stumbling, collapse, unconsciousness, and even seizures can occur. If this happens, seek veterinary care immediately. Watching for these symptoms can help you decide whether you need to get your dog in a cooler environment or if they can stay outside. Water and shade will allow both big and small dogs to withstand higher temperatures for longer periods of time, but you should still monitor for signs of overheating and seek veterinary care if needed.</p><p>If you're not sure if your dog is has overheated, then you can always take its temperature. A digital thermometer can be obtained from a drugstore or pharmacy to see what your dog's rectal temperature is. If it is over 104 degrees, get your dog into a cooler environment and seek veterinary care immediately.</p><h2> Breed Risk Factors for Overheating </h2><p>Unless they are a giant breed, the size of your dog does not play a huge role in whether or not it can withstand hot temperatures, but it can still have a small effect. Typically, smaller dogs are able to tolerate higher temperatures when compared to larger dogs, but there are some exceptions. If a dog of any size is obese, very young, elderly, or is a brachycephalic breed, it will have a harder time in the heat regardless of its size. Additionally, dogs with thicker coats will have a more difficult time staying cool when compared to a dog with short or thin fur.</p><p>Patronek GJ.

Even if no one in your household is Irish, St. Patrick's Day is a great excuse for your fur friends to be even cuter than they normally are!If excessive drinking of Irish beer isn't necessarily your thing, there are some great ways your furry friend can come along with you to take in the occasion. From costumes to parties, here are some ideas (and safety tips) for creating a great time for you and your four-legged friend!</p><h2> Attend a Pet-Friendly St. Patrick's Day Parade </h2><p>Many dogs would love to see the sights of a local parade together, so if any are happening in your area, consider checking it out! Dogs may find it exciting to see all the people and enjoy the spring weather that's warming up. However, do be cautious of loud noises from the parade and onlookers - similar to the Fourth of July, some dogs may get scared easily. But in general, a parade is a great way for your dog to get some exercise and see new sights and smells. Always speak to your vet before you take your animal into crowded areas and check online to see if this particular event is dog-friendly. </p><h2> Dress Your Pet in Green </h2><p>There are some adorable shamrock hats, beanies, bandanas, beads, headbands and even leprechaun costumes that would look so precious on your pooch or your feline. As long as your cat or dog isn't pulling on the costume, chewing it, or showing signs of distress, it's a go ahead to make them look as festive as possible! Please consider these tips on how to dress up your dog safely. </p><h2> Buy Them Some Green Toys </h2><p>St. Patrick's Day is the perfect excuse to buy a cute leprechaun toy, green catnip plush toy, or green bone for your pet to play with. Stores like Petco even have entire sections just for this holiday for your furry friend to choose from!</p><h2> Take Photos &amp; Videos for Instagram or Tik Tok </h2><p>Festive photo shoots for St. Patrick's Day are definitely in store if you put your pets in St. Patrick's Day getups! Thanks to social media, there are designated hashtags where you can have them accrue a fan following. Instead of pictures with your human friends, the main attraction can end up being your best furry friend!</p><h2> Keep Them Far Away From Toxins </h2><p>If you end up hitting a house party with your animal, do be mindful of certain beverages and food, objects, or living things they should not consume. If anyone has a shamrock plant-known as the this can be toxic to dogs. Review this list of other plants that your dog shouldn't ingest.</p><p>Keep your dog away from adult beverages, such as green beer, which can be toxic as well.Traditional foods, such as Irish soda bread, also have raisins that can cause kidney failure in dogs.</p><p>When in doubt, always call your vet or at (888) 426-4435. Reference this sheet so you'll know what to expect when you call.</p><h2> Give Them Safe, Edible Treats </h2><p>Dogs should refrain from human treats, so give them some healthier alternatives that are also green-themed! Spinach and parsley dog bones, green apple biscuits, and green smoothies are all great choices. You can find more recipes online, but please make sure they are healthy, safe options and always check with your vet if you're not sure.</p><h2> Throw a Costume Contest With Other Pet Owners </h2><p>If you have an excess of green treats or want everyone to see your St. Paddy's Day costumes live, consider having a gathering of friends with dogs or cats and bring all the pet friends together. It can be a great time to do all of the above activities with others (as long as your pet is socialized to get along with other animals). This way, there can be multiple treats consumed, multiple cute get-ups to take pictures of, and nice memories made for your pets to all indulge in! </p><p>All in all, as long as no one's getting pinched too much, it's a great time for everyone and their furry companions when St. Patrick's Day rolls around. Consider having some holiday fun this year with your pet as well.</p>",730

Yes: A sleepy dog that really just needs a nap. Whether their sleepiness strikes during playtime, mealtime or just hang time, there's no question: Dogs are really, really good at sleeping and look really cute doing it.</p><h2> How Much Sleep Do Dogs Really Need? </h2><p>Before we dive into the doggos, it's important to note that the amount of sleep dogs actually need varies by age and from breed to breed. Puppies, for example, may sleep a whopping 18 to 19 hours for every 24 hours-which provides plenty of opportunities to snap an adorable #sleepypuppy picture. Larger breeds of dogs, like Greyhounds or Great Danes, are lower-energy and require a lot of sleep, too. High-energy breeds, like Labrador Retrievers and Pomeranians, don't need to doze the day away.</p><p>Not sure if your pupper is catching enough zzz's? Make some simple bedtime modifications to prompt your pet to sleep, and then talk to your veterinarian about what's normal for her breed, age, activity level, and size.</p><h2> Wake Up for Work </h2><p>Do you ever just sit on the edge of your bed, wrapped in a blanket, and wonder if going to work is worth it? No, no, neither does Chase and neither do we.</p><h2> Find a Napping Buddy </h2><p>Some studies suggest that taking a quick afternoon nap can boost productivity and increase focus. But what if you don't have a comfy spot to catch a few zzz's? Follow Winnie's lead and use your brother or sister-or even your cubicle mate, if you're desperate.</p><h2> Take Plenty of Mini-Naps </h2><p>Prepping for houseguests is tiring. Daisy has been doing laundry all weekend in anticipation of her parents' arrival and just needs about, 20 minutes to close her eyes.</p><h2> Get Too Tired to Clean Up </h2><p>Playtime was just much fun and so exhausting, Petey can't even put his toys away. Help a puppy out and clean up, would you? </p><h2> Take Plenty of Breaks </h2><p>Roger is an accomplished hiker who loves to get out into the fresh air on the weekends but needs to take pretty frequent breaks. His little legs can only carry him so far, after all. </p><h2> Get Your Dose of Caffeine </h2><p>Sasha has been up writing the final paper in her ""post-dogtoral"" degree all night. Sometimes she wonders if she even really wants her Ph.D. anymore. </p><h2> Put Your Differences Aside </h2><p>Max has made some serious personal discoveries this year. His biggest accomplishment? Realizing that napping with the kitty was far more rewarding than fighting with the kitty. Our world leaders could learn a thing or two from Max. </p><h2> Put Others First </h2><p>Riley really prefers to have his own space when he sleeps but knows that good boys often put the needs of others before their own needs. Good boy, Riley-you'll get that shut-eye eventually.</p><h2> Avoid Food Blackouts </h2><p>You know when you eat too much on Thanksgiving or Christmas or just a random Wednesday and have to take a long nap to recover from your feast? So does Penny.</p><h2> Just Go Back to Sleep </h2><p>That feeling when you wake up from a nap still tired, super dehydrated and unsure of what year it is. Go back to sleep, Conan.</p><h2> Trick Your Mom </h2><p>Sammy has perfected the art of pretending to be asleep when his mom comes in to wake him up for church. Take note, pups-this is what a serious, I-can't-wake-him-up-because-he's-a-growing-boy snooze looks like.</p><h2> Avoid Sleeping in Weird Spots </h2><p>Have you ever been so tired you fell asleep in a super weird (and uncomfortable) spot? Milo feels you-he was so tired, he fell asleep in one of his mom's decorative baskets. It normally holds decorative seashells.</p><h2> Manage the Monday Blues </h2><p>""It's not Monday. It's not Monday. It is Monday. How is it possible to be so sleepy before the week even begins?"" wonders Peg the Pug.</p><h2> Don't Work Too Hard </h2><p>Charlie loves to help his family with yard work, but carrying heavy branches, grass clippings and bags of leaves get tiring. (Charlie isn't very good at yard work anyway-he gets super distracted by all of the sticks available to him.)</p><h2> Snap a Post-Nap Selfie </h2><p> ""I woke up like this,"" tweets Jack.

40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-are-dewclaws-5199033,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>What Are Dewclaws?</h1>,"<h1>What Are Dewclaws?</h1><p>You may have noticed the thumb-like toe on the inside of your dog's or cat's paw and wondered why it is there. Do dewclaws have a purpose or are they simply leftovers from evolution?</p><h2> What Are Dewclaws? </h2><p>A dewclaw is a non-weight-bearing toe on an animal's paw located on the inside of the leg near the carpus (""wrist"" area). Dewclaws slightly resemble human thumbs but they do not have the same functionality. Dogs and cats are typically born with two front dewclaws, but some may have one or more dewclaws on the rear limbs as well.</p><p>Dewclaws contain nerves, blood vessels, and a nail that grows just like the other toenails. The dewclaw usually contains bones, is firmly attached to the leg, and can be slightly moved by the animal. However, some dewclaws-especially rear dewclaws in dogs-contain no bones and appear to hang from the side of the leg. The nail grows as normal, but there is no bony attachment and no motor function in the digit.</p><h2> What Is the Purpose of Dewclaws? </h2><p>Some people may think that front dewclaws serve no purpose for today's dogs and cats. After all, dogs and cats without dewclaws do not seem to experience limitations. While the dewclaws are not essential, they can be quite useful for many reasons. Dewclaws can help dogs and cats dig, climb, and hold objects or prey. When dogs run, their dewclaws make some contact with the ground and can serve to stabilize the carpus. Watch a dog or cat handling a toy or treat, and you may notice the use of the dewclaws to stabilize the object.</p><p>Rear dewclaws are another matter. These are considered vestigial structures that serve no function for dogs and cats. Rear dewclaws are present at birth and occur due to a genetic trait. Dog breeds like the Great Pyrenees and Beauceron are born with one or more rear dewclaws; this is actually part of the breed standard. Mixed breed dogs may be born with rear dewclaws as well. Polydactyl cats have a genetic mutation that causes them to be born with several extra toes, often including extra dewclaws.</p><h2> Should Dewclaws Be Removed? </h2><p>Some dog breeders remove puppies' dewclaws and dock their tails around 5-7 days old. This may be done because of the belief that the dewclaws serve no purpose and may become injured. It is also sometimes done to create a cleaner look for the show ring and to conform to breed standards.</p><p>Although dewclaw injuries may occur, they are not typically serious and may be avoided by keeping the nails trimmed short. Many vets are moving away from the practice of dewclaw removal in young puppies and prefer to let dogs keep these potentially useful digits. However, don't worry if your dog has already had his dewclaws removed; this will not limit them in any significant way.</p><p>Detached dewclaws in dogs may be removed during spay or neuter surgery to avoid future injuries. These floppy dewclaws are more likely to get injured than attached dewclaws.</p><p>Cat dewclaw removal is not typically done unless it is part of a complete declaw surgery. Feline declawing is the amputation of the last bones of the toes that contain the nails. This is a major surgery for cats and many experts now advise against it in favor of more humane alternatives.</p><h2> Dewclaw Problems in Dogs and Cats </h2><p>Dewclaws often cause no problems for dogs and cats. However, there are situations when nail problems occur. Most commonly, dewclaws may grow too long, curve, and grow into the skin of the paw pad. This can lead to pain, inflammation, and infection.</p><p>Dewclaws may get caught on objects like rocks, plants, and bedding, especially if the nails are too long. This is more common in dogs and may occur while they are running and playing. If a toenail gets caught on something, it may tear the nail or even fracture the toe. Detached dewclaws are more likely to snag on something and cause injury because the digit has no motor function and hangs freely.</p><p>Most dewclaw problems can be avoided by checking the nails regularly and trimming the nails as needed. Learn how to trim dog nails and how to trim cat nails so you can keep your pet's nails healthy. Contact your veterinarian if you have any concerns about your pet's dewclaws.</p>",720
41,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-is-my-vet-so-expensive-1118662,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Understanding the Costs of Veterinary Care</h1>,"<h1>Understanding the Costs of Veterinary Care</h1><p>You bring your dog to the vet for a routine visit or mild illness. You are there for 30-60 minutes and leave with medication. When you go to check out, you are shocked at the total of your bill. How can it possibly cost so much?!</p><p>Do you think your veterinarian charges too much? Sorry to break it to you, but you might be wrong. Dogs can be expensive. We all know that veterinary services can add up, especially when our pets are sick. However, when it really comes down to it, you're probably paying less than those services are truly worth. Unfortunately, many vets still undercharge for their services because the public tends to undervalue quality veterinary care.</p><h2> Veterinarian Profit Margins </h2><p>Here's a reality that pet owners sometimes forget: . In order to thrive, a business needs to make a profit. Unfortunately, some vet practices don't make enough profit to adequately reinvest in their businesses. Even if your vet works in a non-profit facility, a certain amount of income is needed to cover expenses and keep the facility running well.</p><p>Veterinary prices are set to stay competitive within the market, to help cover costs, and to turn a modest profit.</p><h2> Veterinary Expenses </h2><p>Scientific progress has increased vets' abilities to provide more advanced care, including diagnostics and treatments which allow for better health and longevity in our pets, but these new technologies add to costs as well. The truth is that some vet practices still do not charge enough for their services because they worry about the way clients will respond.</p><h3> Salary and Staffing Costs </h3><p>Highly skilled and well-trained staff costs money, but they are worth it. Sadly, many veterinarians and their staff are still very underpaid compared to their counterparts in human medicine.</p><h3> Supplies, Equipment, and Facility Costs </h3><p>Supplies, equipment, and facility costs are similar to those in human medicine, but veterinary charges to clients are set much lower than their human medicine equivalents. If you don't believe this, ask your doctor's office or local hospital about their charges for uninsured patients.</p><h3> Business Costs </h3><p>Veterinary medicine is a business. A certain amount of profit is needed in order to keep the business thriving.</p><h2> Saving Money on Vet Care </h2><p>It's one thing to have trouble affording veterinary care because you are on a fixed income or otherwise have trouble making ends meet. If this is your financial situation, look for ways to save money on dog care. Your best bet is to look for a low-cost or non-profit veterinary center. It's also a good idea to purchase pet insurance if possible. Communicate with your vet about your financial limitations. Most vets will do anything possible to work within your budget. </p><p>However, if you are balking at vet charges when you afford it, that might mean you are missing something. Consider this: if you can afford to go on a decent vacation and are willing to budget for that vacation, that means you see the value in that vacation. It's time to start seeing the value of quality veterinary care. As with most things in life, you get what you pay for.</p><h2> Research Costs and Budgeting </h2><p>Plan ahead by including veterinary expenses in your budget. Pay attention to what you are actually getting from your vet. These are things like experience, knowledge, quality staff, nice facility, etc. </p><p>It's also important that you make informed, practical decisions about your pet's veterinary care. You must be your dog's advocate. That means you should become familiar with the veterinary care available and the treatment options presented to you. Ask a lot of questions and do a lot of research. Consider reading the book , written by veterinary internal medicine specialist Dr. Nancy Kay. Buy on Amazon</p><p>After all of this, if your vet's office still doesn't seem worth the price, then it might be time to look for a different veterinary hospital.

42,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-measure-your-dog-4782403,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>How to Properly Measure Your Dog for Clothes</h1>,"<h1>How to Properly Measure Your Dog for Clothes</h1><p>More and more people are purchasing more than harnesses and collars for their dogs, but clothes too. It's important to know how to properly measure your dog for these items so that they can be comfortable stylish. You will need a tape measure, preferably a 'dressmaker/fabric' tape measure as used for sewing projects, and your dog.</p><h2> How to Get Your Dog's Measurements </h2><p>There are three main areas to measure on your dog: top line back, neck girth, and chest girth.</p><p>To get an accurate measurement for your dog's top line back, while they are standing, measure from where your dog's neck meets his shoulders (oftentimes where the collar rests) to the base of the tail. If your dog happens to be male, be cognizant of the design of coats and sweaters. If there isn't a cut out or cut away in the area that would be covering their belly, you may need to size down so that your dog doesn't accidentally urinate on his new clothes. If your dog happens to be between sizes, choose the larger size.</p><p>Neck girth and chest girth are exactly what they sound like: the measurement around your dog's neck and chest. The measurement for neck girth should be taken around where your dog's collar sits. As with collars, use the 'two finger' rule: you should be able to easily fit two fingers under the tape measure. If your dog is between sizes, choose the larger size. The chest girth measurement should be taken around the largest part of your dog's chest. This is usually located just behind the front legs. If your dog is between sizes, choose the larger size.</p><h2> Harnesses </h2><p>If you're measuring your dog for a harness, you will need to read the dimensions listed by the manufacturer's carefully. Some products may list what dog measurements they fit while others may list dimensions of the actual product. Harnesses can seem a bit overwhelming. There are just so many different varieties and styles out there. They can prove very useful for certain dog breeds and certain temperaments.</p><p>Brachycephalic breeds, that is, those with pushed in faces, tend to have very little neck for a collar. Harnesses are ideal for these breeds. They provide better control and are less apt to slip off. Other dogs that may not always have perfect leash manners, even if they are otherwise well behaved and well trained. Harnesses not only allow for you to control your dog without them choking themselves, but certain types of harnesses can even deter pulling.</p><h2> Collars </h2><p>You may be surprised to learn that there's more on the market than just the old fashioned buckle style collars. There are martingale collars, there are chain collars, and there are prong collars. Chain and prong collars are oftentimes used by certain trainers as a means of 'correction'. As the field of veterinary medicine progresses, though, more and more research into animal behavior shows us that training methods using aversive corrections is not only unnecessary for an animal to learn a new behavior, it can actually be harmful. Martingale collars are quickly becoming one of the more popular 'alternative' collars out there.</p><p>The basic design of a martingale collar is that is has two loops. One loop is much larger and that loop is what slips over your dog's head. The smaller loop is what you clip your dog's leash to. When your dog pulls on the leash, that pulls the smaller loop taut, which in turns tightens the larger loop, preventing it from slipping it off your dog's head. This is also why martingale collars are sometimes called 'humane choke collars'.</p><p>When fitting your dog for a martingale collar, the two finger rule still applies. When the collar is loose, you should be able to fit two fingers comfortably under the collar. These collars are quickly becoming popular among owners of larger, stronger dogs, but they were originally created with sighthounds in mind. Dogs such as greyhounds, whippets, and silken windhounds are so incredibly sleek and aerodynamic that even a properly fitted buckle collar can slip off too easily. Martingale collars may be growing more popular with the dog owners in general, but if you have a sighthound, a martingale collar is a must.</p>",710
43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/are-dogs-colorblind-5215187,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>Are Dogs Colorblind?</h1>,"<h1>Are Dogs Colorblind?</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Unless they have some sort of birth defect, disease, or have experienced trauma that affects their sight, dogs have excellent vision. But just because they can see well doesn't mean they can see all the same colors that humans can see. Many people think dogs can only see black and white, but that simply isn't true.</p><h2> What Is Color Blindness? </h2><p>Color blindness is also known as color deficiency because someone with color blindness cannot see colors normally. Color blindness is not the same as achromatopsia, where only black, white, and shades of gray can be seen. In order to see colors normally, at least three types of special photoreceptors in the eye, called cones, need to be present. When light is reflected off an object, it enters the eye and hits different types of tiny photoreceptors which then transmits a signal to the brain to tell us what color we see. In color blindness, however, some of these types of photoreceptors are missing or don't work properly. This means that some colors are not properly seen and that individual is color blind.</p><h2> What Colors Can Dogs See? </h2><p>Humans usually have three types of cones-the part of the eye that allows to see colors. But unlike humans, dogs only have two types of cones. This means that humans have the ability to see a greater variety and more vibrant colors than dogs. But dogs don't just see in black, white and gray. The two types of cones that dogs do have enable them to see shades of yellow, blue, and brown alongside black, white, and gray. These cones don't allow them to see shades of red or green though, so a dog instead sees red and green colors as shades of brown or gray.</p><p>Because dogs don't see red and green colors, opt for shades of yellow and blue when choosing a toy for your dog. These colors can be seen as their true shades, so they are much more appealing to your dog. This is one reason why yellow tennis balls are so popular among dogs, even though dogs don't see them as brightly as humans.</p><h2> Night Vision </h2><p>Although cones may be important for seeing colors and details, other parts of your dog's eyes play different roles in their vision. Rods are another type of receptor that are found in your dog's retinas and are much more prevalent than cones. Rods are responsible for perceiving brightness, so they determine how well a dog can see at night. They also help a dog determine the size and shape of objects and how good their peripheral vision is. Because dogs have so many more rods than cones in their eyes, their night vision is much stronger than their ability to see colors.</p><p>In addition to the rods and cones that are found in the retina, the tapetum lucidum is a part of the eye that is found behind the retina. It helps reflect any light that enters the eye and further enhances a dog's night vision. Humans do not have a tapetum lucidum, but many other animals like ferrets, cats, and even fish do.</p><h2> Visual Acuity </h2><p>Dogs may have great night vision, but they don't have perfect eyesight when compared to humans. The typical visual acuity of a dog is 20/75 compared to 20/20, which is the normal visual acuity of humans. This means that if a person could identify details of an object from 75 feet away, a dog would need to be 20 feet away to start to see the same details.</p><p>With all these factors taken into account, you may think that your eyes are superior to your canine friend's since you have better visual acuity and can see more colors, but that is not the case. Their eyes are simply different than ours and what dogs lack from their daytime visual abilities, they more than make up for with their excellent night vision.</p> ",656
44,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-boarding-your-pet-4694121,Dogs > Getting Started,<h1>What You Need to Know About Boarding Your Pet</h1>,"<h1>What You Need to Know About Boarding Your Pet</h1><p>Making plans to leave your dog or cat behind when you travel can sometimes be stressful and confusing. Who will take care of your beloved pet while you're away? Luckily, dog and cat boarding facilities are abundant, with varied services and cost. Let's look at your options.</p><h2> Vet Boarding Services </h2><p>Some veterinary hospitals offer in-clinic boarding services. Dogs are typically housed in large cages or kennel runs. Cats generally stay separately from dogs in smaller cages or ""kitty condos"" (multi-level enclosures). Boarded pets are housed separately from sick pets. Clinic staff feeds and walks or plays with the boarded dogs and cats several times a day, and keeps their kennels or cages clean. For pet's that require special medical care, discuss with your vet if they recommend boarding at their office where staff may know your pet or finding a trusted petsitter to come to your home. This discussion with your vet is important especially for pets, such as diabetic pets who get daily insulin injections, pets receiving multiple medications, pets with mobility issues, or those with medical issues that require close supervision.</p><h2> Kennel Boarding Facilities  </h2><p>With a little searching, you're likely to find various pet boarding facilities in your area. You can find facilities that accept all pets and some that only accept dogs or only accept cats. Many boarding facilities offer a ""cage-free"" boarding experience, where the dogs or cats can hang out in a safely enclosed play area during the day, returning to kennels or cages for naps and bedtime. Dogs are generally separated by size and/or age so that large, rowdy dogs aren't trampling over smaller, more timid dogs. At most facilities that offer free play time, staff members stay in the play areas with the pets to ensure all animals are safe and having a good time. Some boarding facilities like this even use video monitors so you can log on to their website and watch your pet having a great time, which can give a worried pet parent much peace of mind.</p><h2> High-End Boarding Facilities  </h2><p>As people continue to treat their pets more like family than animals, high-end pet boarding facilities are more prevalent. Such facilities, which are marketed to feel more like hotels than kennels, provide a level of comfort and care that exceeds your typical cage or kennel run, with huge pet suites outfitted like ""home,"" complete with queen-sized beds, couches, TVs, webcams and even two-way video chat so you can see and talk to your pet. These days, it seems the sky's the limit with posh boarding facilities.</p><h2> Extra Services </h2><p>Whatever type of pet boarding facility you choose, most offer add-on services that you can choose for your pet, either during their stay or just before you go home.</p><h2> Making a Reservation  </h2><p>Although it's sometimes possible to find boarding accommodations at the last minute, many places fill up on weekends. Holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Fourth of July can be booked solid many weeks or even months in advance. It's always best to call ahead and make a reservation when you know you will be away. If you haven't taken your pet to the facility before, ask if you can take a tour (usually without your pet). </p><h2> What to Bring When Boarding Your Pet </h2><p>Bring your pet's food with feeding instructions and any medications with instructions. Some places ask you to bring your pet's collar, ID tag, and leash; others use their own collars and tags. You can also bring special treats, and your pet's bed, special blanket, or toys, but keep in mind that such things could become soiled and even destroyed in a boarding situation. Don't send your pet's one-of-a-kind, can't-live-without toy or bed. It's often best to use the bedding provided by the boarding facility. Ask for advice when making your pet's reservation. </p><p>Don't forget to make sure your pet is up to date on his vaccines. Call ahead to find out which vaccines are required. Bring proof with you from your veterinarian. Most boarding facilities ask that you update your pet's vaccines well in advance of their stay. </p>",689
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-does-my-cat-stink-5071501,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>Why Does My Cat Stink?</h1>,"<h1>Why Does My Cat Stink?</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Do you have a stinky cat? Cats are generally known for their cleanliness. Most are fastidious self-groomers, which keeps them free of dirt and odors. However, you may sometimes find that your cat smells bad. Although some cat odors are harmless or easy to fix, others can mean there is a health problem.</p><h2>Why Does My Cat Stink?</h2><p>The best way to figure out why your cat stinks is to determine the source of the odor. Is your cat just stinky around the head or face? The rear end? Do you notice an odor on a particular part of the coat or does it seem to be all over? Asking these questions is the first step in addressing the problem with your stinky cat. Once you know where to odor is coming from, you will have a better chance of helping your cat.</p><h2>Causes of Odors in Cat</h2><p>There are several potential reasons for bad odors in cats. Once you are able to determine the location of the odor, you may be able to figure out the root cause. In many cases, your cat will need to go to the veterinarian. If you are unable to determine the source of the odor, it's still important to contact your vet.</p><h3>Mouth</h3><p>Some people assume it's normal for cats to have bad breath or halitosis. However, consistent bad breath in cats is usually a sign of a health problem. Temporary mouth odors may be caused by something the cat ate.</p><p>Dental disease is probably the most common cause of bad breath in cats. Plaque and tartar buildup has a foul odor due to its bacteria content. The buildup can cause gingivitis and lead to gum disease, leading to tooth loss.</p><p>Ulcers, growths, and wounds in the mouth can develop an unpleasant odor if left untreated. Bacteria in the mouth can make these worse. These lesions may be caused by stomatitis or some other problem. Not only are these very bad-smelling; they are usually also very uncomfortable for the cat. Mouth odor can also develop with severe kidney disease or unregulated diabetes.</p><h3>Rear End</h3><p>If the foul odor is coming from the area around the base of the tail, chances are it's a problem around the anus.</p><p>Flatulence is normal in humans and animals, and cats are no exception. If your cat is passing gas frequently or it has an extremely bad smell, there may be a gastrointestinal problem.</p><p>Diarrhea can leave traces of loose stool around the rear end. It may be difficult for the cat to keep up with grooming if diarrhea keeps happening. If your cat has had diarrhea for two or more days, it's time to see a veterinarian.</p><p>Constipation causes stool to back up in the colon, making the cat strain to defecate. The hard, impacted stool might not pass, but sometimes liquid stool is able to pass. This can get on your cat around the rear end and tends to smell especially foul. This is a very uncomfortable situation for the cat and is sometimes a sign of a more serious health issue.</p><p>Anal glands are tiny sacs located just outside a cat's anus. They contain an oily, putrid, somewhat fishy-smelling fluid that is normally expressed during defecation. The fluid may also be released during acute fear, stress, or excitement (similar to a skunk's scent glands). In some cases, the anal glands can become inflamed, infected, or impacted. Some of the fluid can seep out, leaving a very foul odor on a cat that doesn't seem to go away. These cats may scoot and rub their rear ends or lick the anus obsessively.</p><p>Perianal fistulas are wounds in and around the anal area that have a tunnel-like structure. Though these are relatively uncommon in cats they can be very serious. Perianal fistulas as extremely uncomfortable and highly malodorous. They can lead to or occur in conjunction with other GI problems and often require surgical treatment.</p><h3>Skin and Coat</h3><p>If your cat's odor seems to be coming from all over the body, then it might be a problem with the skin and coat. A bath may help if your cat is noticeably dirty. However, if your cat looks relatively clean, there may be something deeper going on. Seek veterinary medical care to address the skin condition in your cat.</p><p>Skin infections can cause a cat to have a bad smell all over. If the infection is serious, the cat may have a thinning coat and visibly irritated skin. You may notice a greasy, smelly coating on your hands after petting a cat with a major skin infection. The odor is typically caused by bacterial or fungal overgrowth.</p><p>Wounds on the skin may stay hidden under the hair and become infected. This may cause a foul-smelling discharge (pus) to seep out of the wound. If your cat's body smells bad and you can't seem to find the source, try running your fingers through the coat and looking for wounds. If you find one, see your vet as soon as possible.</p><h3>Ears</h3><p>Ear infections are caused by an overgrowth of yeast, bacteria, or ear mites in the ears. Beside scratching and head-shaking, you may notice that your cat's ears smell horrible. Have a look inside to see if there is debris present as this is often a sign of an ear infection. Be sure to visit your vet soon to determine if an ear infection is present and to begin appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Urinary Problems</h3><p>Cat urine has a very strong ammonia-like smell that can get smell even worse when there is a problem. Urinary tract infections can cause the urine to smell especially putrid. Incontinence or the inability to control urination can result in your cat smelling like urine or pee. If your cat smells like urine, it's important to see the vet to determine the cause.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If your cat is straining to urinate but not actually passing urine, this is an emergency. Your cat may be blocked. Urinary obstructions are extremely life-threatening. Bring your cat to the nearest open vet immediately.</p><h2>When to Call the Vet</h2><p>Remember that cats are experts at masking illness. By the time you notice any signs of illness, things might be very serious. Be sure to contact your vet at the earliest signs of illness or if you detect an unusual odor that is not going away.</p>",1042
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-age-to-human-age-chart-554306,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>How Old Is Your Cat in Human Years?</h1>,"<h1>How Old Is Your Cat in Human Years?</h1><p>Historically, people often think every year of a cat's life is equivalent to seven years of a human's life, but cats actually age must faster than that. And with age, we know that diseases often follow, but cats also act differently at certain life stages. Because of these things, it's not only helpful but also important to be able to understand what your cat is going through at each stage of its life.</p><h2>Kittens From Birth to Six Months</h2><p>The first six months of a kitten's life are filled with eye-opening experiences-literally. A kitten's eyes and ears open shortly after birth at around one to two weeks of age, and from there, its physical and mental development takes off. A kitten is exposed to sights, sounds, and smells just like that of a human infant. Each new animal, person, and object it comes in contact with helps to form its personality. Over the course of the next few weeks, the socialization skills of a kitten are greatly affected depending on all of these interactions and exposures.</p><p>After a kitten leaves its mother at about two to three months of age, it will start to become more independent and curious. It will explore its surroundings, get into a little trouble, and potentially chew on things it shouldn't chew while its adult teeth are starting to erupt. Growth happens fast during these months and by the time a kitten is six months old, they are comparable to a 10-year-old child in age.</p><p>A series of vaccinations will need to be performed and kittens are typically spayed or neutered around six months of age. Most hereditary or congenital issues are usually discovered by your veterinarian during this time if there are any at all.</p><h2>Kittens Become Adults - From Six Months to Three Years Old</h2><p>Since a six-month-old kitten is already comparable to a double-digit human child, older kittens and younger adult cats will continue to test their boundaries as they grow into adults. By the time your cat is one year old, it will have reached its adult size and its preferences, habits, etc. are typically established.</p><p>A one-year-old cat is physiologically similar to a 15-year-old human, and a two-year-old cat is like a 24-year-old person. Adult cats don't need as many vaccinations as a kitten needs and are usually healthy, but this age period is a good time to get some baseline blood work performed to know what your cat's normal values look like. You'll thank yourself when your cat is older and you have something to compare its blood work to. Occasional grooming, dental cleanings, and annual check-ups with a veterinarian are typically all that is necessary to keep a young adult cat healthy.</p><h2>Prime Cats - From Three to Six Years Old</h2><p>A three to six-year-old cat is still an adult but not a senior cat yet. These years are usually trouble-free in regards to health concerns, but some cats do have chronic health issues or congenital concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>A prime cat may benefit from early joint support supplements to keep its hips and knees working as they should, will need annual vet check-ups with regular vaccinations, and may experience an occasional health concern, but overall this age period is usually a healthy one.</p><h2>Mature Cats - From Seven to Ten Years Old</h2><p>Once your cat reaches about seven or eight years of age, some veterinarians may start referring to it as a senior, but we know that since cats typically live into their late teens, they're not yet senior citizens. While cats who are nine or ten years of age might have been eligible for an AARP card if they were humans, they haven't quite reached retirement age yet.</p><p>This is an important age period to ensure your aging cat is getting proper nutrition because obesity is common in middle age. Also check that your cat hasn't developed dental disease, kidney issues, or a heart murmur, and is still able to jump on and off things easily. Blood work should be compared to that which was done during the younger years to ensure there are no trending changes in organ function and more frequent check-ups with your veterinarian are recommended.</p><h2>Senior Cats - From Eleven to Fourteen Years Old</h2><p>Your cat is finally a true senior when it reaches eleven years of age. Joint issues are a commonly hidden concern that owners of aging cats should be addressing and organ functionality may start to decrease. Blood work should be monitored at the recommendation of your veterinarian to ensure common problems seen in senior cats are caught early. Dietary changes may also be recommended at this age since older cats typically need different nutrition as their bodies change.</p><p>Some older cats seem to get crabby as they age, but this is often simply because a senior cat may be experiencing pain or joint discomfort or even brain changes and confusion. Be sure to discuss any observed changes with your veterinarian, as they may be an indicator of something else going on with your cat.</p><h2>Geriatric Cats - From Fifteen to Twenty and Older</h2><p>Cats live a long time. A 15-year-old cat is comparable in age to a human in their mid-70s, and by the time they are 20, they'd almost be 100 years old if they were a person. Any cat that is 15 or older is considered geriatric and should be visiting the veterinarian at least once every six months. These cats may be on medications or special foods and supplements to support various bodily systems. Geriatric cats often have decreased hearing and vision abilities and sleep for the majority of the day.</p><p>Cognitive decline is not uncommon in cats of this age, just like a human in their 90s might experience. Signs of cognitive dysfunction in cats include crying at night and urinating or defecating near, but not in, the litter box, among others.</p><p>While it's more common for a cat to live into its 20s than it is for a dog, a cat this old is still an accomplishment and special attention should definitely be paid to these geriatric felines.</p>",1015

However, in the case of a cat, you'll be shopping for a litter box instead of a changing table.</p><p>Before you bring your new cat or kitten home, there are a number of things to collect or buy, so your cat will feel like a family member rather than a visitor. Do this a few days in advance to minimize stress for you and your cat on ""homecoming day."" In the excitement of bringing your cat home, you don't want to suddenly discover at 8 p.m. that you forgot to buy cat food.</p><h2>Prepare a Safe Room for Your Cat</h2><p>A ""Safe Room"" doesn't need to be a separate room but could be an empty closet, a corner of your bedroom with a protective screen, or a seldom-used bathroom. The important thing is that your new cat has a place it can call ""home,"" where it can retreat and rest. It may voluntarily choose to socialize with you and other family members, but for now, let it decide whether to hide or mingle. It may take several days to a week or more, depending on its history, but your patience at this point will yield exponential results in a happier relationship with your cat in later days.</p><h2>Cat-Proof Your Home</h2><p>Photo Credit: &copy; Franny Syufy</p><p>You've decided where you're going to go to adopt your new kitty; possibly you've already narrowed your selection down to one cat you simply must bring home.

Your knowledge of cat food ingredients will help ensure not only longevity but the quality of life you want for your new family member.</p><p>Although cats descend from desert creatures, fresh water is also essential to them, especially if they eat a dry food diet.</p><p>Make sure you read cat food labels to know what you're feeding your new family member. You should review for weeks and months ahead until you feel secure in your knowledge. Once you learn to read cat food labels it will become a habit for life.</p><p>A source of clean, fresh water is also vital to your cat's well-being. Although cats have descended from desert animals, they still need to be well-hydrated.</p><h2>Get a Litter Box and Take Care of Sleeping Arrangements</h2><p>Next, to food and water, a litter box is critical for your new cat's comfort and health.

The royal life, huh?</p><h2>Jungle Cat Tree</h2><p>If you're looking for a wallet-friendly cat tree or just want to help your cat embrace his inner-jungle cat, you're going to want to check out this do-it-yourself creation. Handmade with branches, rope, covered plywood, and faux greenery, this cat tree is tricked out with all of the features your cat loves-including perches and scratching spots-but is easy on your wallet. In fact, you probably already have most of the supplies in your garage!</p><h2>Mid-Century Modern Cat Tree</h2><p>If your home is decked out in mid-century modern decor, it only makes sense to buy a mid-century modern cat tree, right? Characterized by clean lines and organic shapes, mid-century modern home decor has dominated the industry since the 1950s-and these days, it 's totally accessible to kitties, too. This cat tree, with its sleek lines and neutral color, would make Frank Lloyd Wright (the father of mid-century modern design!) proud.</p><h2>Multi-Platform Cat Tree</h2><p>Your cat 's 3 a.m. hijinks make it sound like there 's a circus going on in your living room, so you might as well give your kitty a solid place to perform. Featuring plenty of platforms, a hammock, scratching posts, and ladder, your kitty can get his acrobatics on at all hours of the night-and then snooze the day away on one of the upholstered platforms.</p><h2>The Lion King Cat Tree</h2><p>Remember the iconic Pride Rock scene from the Disney classic ? Your cat can recreate it every single day with this massive (and super creative!) cat tree. Made from solid wood, it offers kitties plenty of places to romp, scratch, and belt out-err, meow out-The Circle of Life.Because this cat tree is so huge, we 'd recommend mounting it to both the floor and ceiling. You never know when your cat might have to have a showdown with Scar and his hyenas, after all.</p><h2>Minimalist Cat Tree</h2><p>If your cat loves simplistic design, white walls, and IKEA, she just might be a decor minimalist-and this minimalist cat tree can fulfill all of her Scandinavian cat tree dreams. It checks all the boxes for minimalistic design-including a simple, organic color palette and shape-while satisfying her need to scratch and snooze. Add a really expensive kitty drink from a hip coffee shop, and she 'll be set.</p><h2>A Wall-Mounted Jungle Gym for Cats</h2><p>If you 're lacking some floor space-and your cat is lacking in energy-a wall-mounted cat tree might be the perfect solution. With platforms, bridges, ladders, and hammocks, your cat can channel his inner Indiana Jones and leap from mount to mount. You can create your own wall-mounted cat tree with a few common household items or purchase one from your favorite pet retailer. Just be sure to mount each component to a stud in your wall, so they don 't collapse under your cat 's weight. And, of course, watch out for flying kitties when you walk across the room.</p><h2>Where to Find the Perfect Cat Tree</h2><p>There are literally thousands of cat trees on the market, so it 's important to identify your cat 's needs, as well as the type of cat tree your space can accommodate. If your cat loves to scratch, choose a cat tree that features multiple scratching posts. Your cat 's nails and your furniture will thank you! And if you don 't have a ton of square footage for a cat tree, consider a wall-mounted system that will save you precious floor space. Fortunately, pre-made and assembled cat trees are easy to find online and at your favorite pet supply retailers.</p><p>If you want to save a few dollars (and flex your do-it-yourself muscles!) creating your own cat tree is much easier than you might think.</p><p>If possible, use a staple gun to assemble your DIY cat tree-it 'll increase the durability and stability of your cat tree while protecting your cat 's paws from sharp nails and screws. You can also try super strong wood glue, but be sure to let it dry fully before letting your cat play.</p>",994
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/shopping-list-for-your-new-cat-552019,Cats > Getting Started,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>Shopping List for Your New Cat</h1>,"<h1>Shopping List for Your New Cat</h1><p>Before you bring your new cat or kitten home, there are a number of things to collect or buy, so your cat will feel like a family member rather than a visitor. Do this a few days in advance to save stress on the ""big day."" In the excitement of bringing your cat home, you don't want to suddenly discover at 8 p.m. that you forgot to buy cat food.</p><h2>Food</h2><p>If you can talk to the caregiver in the cat's last home, it's probably best to give your new pet whatever food she's accustomed to. If you acquire a cat from a breeder, more often than not, their contract will either strongly suggest or require you to feed a certain kind of food.</p><h3>What to Buy for Kittens</h3><p>These babies need more fats and proteins than grown cats, so look for foods with ""Complete and Balanced Nutrition"" on the label as well as the AAFCO animal feeding tested statement ""for all life stages."" There are also foods specifically formulated for kittens. These can be identified by the words ""highly digestible, nutrient-dense and uniquely designed to meet kittens' nutritional requirements."" Kittens from eight weeks upward can handle dry food quite well, although canned food is really better for them.</p><h3>What to Buy for Adult Cats</h3><p>Canned foods are better for cats, but your cat may be used to dry food only. Grown cats thrive on dry food, and any of the premium brands are acceptable. You should also supplement with canned food because eventually, you should try to move your cat over to canned only.</p><h2>Food and Water Bowls</h2><p>Although your new cat can be fed on any ceramic (non-lead-glazed) or stainless steel bowls you have in your kitchen, you may feel better with providing her with her very own dishes. It is not recommended to use plastic dishes for cats, as some cats develop a chin rash from plastic; also, softer plastic scratches, which provides a harbor from bacteria (possibly a case of cause-and-effect here.)There are a number of non-tip stainless steel bowls available for pets. If you prefer decorated ceramic dishes, make sure the glaze is lead-free. To be safe, purchase only products made in the U.S.</p><p>Automatic food and water servers are especially nice if the humans will be gone for long periods during the day, e.g., to a job or school. Most cats love the pure, fresh taste of running water, and automatic water dispensers ensure a constant supply of clean water.</p><h2>Toys</h2><p>All cats love to play, and your bonding time will begin by playing with Kitty and her toys. The ""fishing pole, dangling lure"" kind of toy is a big favorite for interactive play. Just make sure it is sturdy enough that small kittens won't tear off feathers, etc. from the dangling part. Catnip mice are a perennial favorite. Kitty houses and climbing posts can run the gamut from simple cardboard creations to custom built ""cat furniture"" combinations running several hundred dollars.</p><h2>Grooming Tools</h2><p>Grooming time is a fine time for bonding with your cat or new kitten. Look for a fine-toothed comb and a rubber-backed pin brush. A nail clipper designed for cats is a plus. If you start clipping your kitten's nails early, it will make the task much easier when she is grown.</p><h2>Cat Carrier</h2><p>This is a must. Don't ever try to transport a cat without one. A simple cardboard carrier (available from your vet) is fine for bringing a new cat or kitten home, but you'll need to replace this eventually with a solid-bottomed fiberglass or tough plastic carrier with secure latch and a screened opening the cat can look through. A heavy-duty cloth airline-approved carrier is a good alternative if travel is in your future.</p><h2>Scratching Post</h2><p>Your cat is going to scratch, whether you approve or not. Start your relationship off right by investing in a scratching post. It can be as simple or fancy as you like; you can even assemble one yourself if you're handy with tools. Some commercially-made scratching posts have catnip scent applied to attract your kitty. If your budget is limited, start with a cardboard scratcher, such as the Cosmic Alpine Scratcher.</p><h2>Litter Box and Litter</h2><p>Choosing the best litter box for your pet is an absolute must for both indoor and indoor-outdoor cats. Look for a sizable box with high sides for grown cats, as they tend to throw the litter around quite a bit. These can also be as simple or as extravagant as your pocketbook allows but start with a basic plastic litter box for now placed correctly for your feline.</p><p>Kittens will need a box that's low enough for them to enter easily. There are various kinds of litter, and the plant-based kind seems to be the safest. Clumping clay litter contains an ingredient that can harm cats if ingested, and all clay litters tend to stir up dust, which is not healthy to breathe, either for you or your cat.</p><p>Consider a mat under the box to catch the stray litter. You can buy mats for that purpose at a pet store, or buy a few inexpensive carpet or linoleum samples that can just be tossed and replaced when they get too grungy.</p><h2>A Bed (Optional, but Recommended)</h2><p>Since this is your first cat, he or she may likely sleep on your own bed, however, it's still a good idea to provide kitty with her own special, cozy place for napping. The bed should be comfortable, easily washable and spacious enough for an adult cat to curl up comfortably, but not so vast that she'll feel exposed and vulnerable.</p><h2>Make a Vet Appointment</h2><p>This is not exactly an item for a shopping list, but unless your cat comes with papers showing a recent veterinary visit, proof of vaccinations, and negative test results for various diseases and medical conditions, your first stop before even bringing her home, should be at your local veterinary clinic. So make the appointment now, while you're thinking about it.</p><h3>Watch Now: 14 Ways Cats Show Their Love</h3>",986
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-find-a-cat-sitter-4687507,Cats > Getting Started,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>How to Find a Cat Sitter</h1>,"<h1>How to Find a Cat Sitter</h1><p>What do you do when you need to travel and leave your cat behind? Knowing that a trusted caregiver is watching your precious cat gives you peace of mind when you have to be away. But how do you find someone you can trust? Luckily, many options are available to you, from pet boarding facilities to pet sitters, both professional and more causal like friends or family. Depending on your desires and your cat's needs, you might be better off boarding your cat outside of your home or hiring someone to look after them in the comfortable surroundings of your house.</p><h2>Family, Friends, and Neighbors</h2><p>One of the simplest and more cost-effective options is to ask a good friend, family member, or even a neighbor to look after your cat in your home. Depending on your cat's needs and personality, you could have someone come by two or three times a day to feed your cat, give medications, clean the litter box, and play with your cat. You could also ask the caregiver to stay in your home and spend the night so your cat has someone around for company. As a bonus, your family member, friend or neighbor can bring in your mail, water your plants, and take care of other light household chores.</p><p>Having a familiar person look after your cat in your home is a great option for shy cats who might become stressed if you were to take them to a boarding facility. It's also a low-cost option-some good friends or family might watch your cat for free, or you might offer to pay a nominal amount for their help. Taking care of a cat is also a great opportunity for an older, responsible neighbor child looking to earn a little money. If your cat is OK with changes to routine, you could also bring your cat and all of its things to your family member or friend's home.</p><h2>Cat Boarding Facilities</h2><p>You can board your cat overnight at a pet boarding facility or your veterinary clinic if they offer this option. Pet boarding facilities typically have staff caring for the pets for about 10 to 12 hours a day. The pets are usually left alone at night, safe and snug in their enclosures, although some facilities might offer overnight care as well. Most pet boarding facilities offer services for both dogs and cats, but the cats are generally housed in separate quarters from the dogs so they aren't stressed by the sight, smell, and sound of the dogs. Some specialty cat-only boarding facilities are a peaceful oasis for cats.</p><p>Pet boarding facilities are a good option for friendly, outgoing cats who won't become upset by being out of their normal environment. They are also a good choice for cats with special medical needs who need to be observed. If your cat requires medical care or special medication, boarding at a facility with a veterinarian or veterinary technician on staff is helpful.</p><p>Fees for cat boarding can range depending on the type of facility. Boarding your cat at a boarding facility tends to be less expensive than some professional pet sitting services but more expensive than having family, a friend, or a neighbor look in on your cat. When you board your cat, you generally provide your cat's regular food and possibly a bed or blanket. The facility typically provides a litter box and cat litter, although you can bring your own if your cat is picky.</p><h2>Professional Cat Sitter</h2><p>If you can't find a family member, friend, or neighbor to watch your cat, a professional cat sitter is a great option. Professional cat sitters can come to your home several times a day to feed and play with the cat and clean up the litter box. Some professional pet sitters will also move in full-time while you're away so the cat always has someone around. Like non-professionals, pet sitters will do other household tasks such as pick up your mail, water your plants, and take out the trash.</p><p>There are lots of ways to find a great professional cat sitter. You can ask your veterinarian or groomer for a referral, or ask friends, family, or neighbors for recommendations. If you can't get a personal referral, check neighborhood social media outlets for local pet sitters. You can also look for a certified professional pet sitter through the pet sitting websites.</p><p>Fees for professional cat sitters vary depending on your area and whether the sitter comes over a few times a day or stays in your home the entire time you're away. Cat sitter fees can be comparable to boarding facilities, sometimes a bit higher for overnight sitting.</p><h2>Preparing to Go Away</h2><p>Regardless of who watches your cat, have that person come over before you leave on your trip so they can become familiar with your home and your cat's routine and required care. Write down how much to feed your cat and what time it eats, as well as instructions for any medications it takes and other care it needs. Also, write down the name, number, and address of your veterinarian just in case.</p><p>Show the cat sitter where you keep the cat food and where the litter box, litter, and cleaning supplies are located. If you board your cat, the sitter will have you fill out a form with feeding and other important instructions. Many cat sitters will text or email you a written report and even photos letting you know how your cat is doing each day so you don't worry while you're away. Some boarding facilities have ""pet cams"" so you can check in with your cat to see what it's doing via video. Knowing your cat is happy and in good hands while you're away will allow you to enjoy your vacation or work trip without worrying about your beloved pet.</p>",972
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-you-found-a-lost-cat-4692898,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>What to Do if You Found a Lost Cat</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if You Found a Lost Cat</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>It's natural to want to help if you find a lost cat. But how can you help, and how do you know if it's a feral cat or someone's pet? Choosing the right steps in this scenario is key, since you don't want to end up assuming a lost or stray cat is feral. Nor do you want to take a feral cat into your home or to a shelter, since a cat who wasn't socialized in kitten-hood is unlikely to ever adapt to life with humans. It's important then that you determine what you're working with so that you can figure out your best plan of action.</p><h2>Feral Cat, Stray Cat, or Lost Cat?</h2><p>Your first task is going to be to figure out whether the cat who you've found is a stray or lost cat or if it's feral.</p><p>A feral cat is a domestic cat who does not have a human caretaker. Feral cats have had no or little contact with humans, and while it may be tempting to ""rescue"" one, they are quite sufficient at surviving on their own.</p><p>A stray cat is a domestic cat who did have a caretaker but has left or lost their home. Strays have had human contact before, though as that contact lessens they may become feral. Strays are generally a bit more trusting of humans though, and most can learn to trust again.</p><p>A lost cat is a pet who has gotten out. Usually the owners of a lost cat will be actively on the lookout, so you may see signs posted. You may also see a collar and a tag on the cat, but the lack of a collar does not mean the cat is not lost.</p><p>It's not always easy to tell the difference between these various types of cats right away, but feline advocacy group Alley Cat Allies has some tips for figuring out if a cat is feral or stray. If the cat isn't feral, you can then move on to the steps in the next section.</p><h3>Signs a Cat Is Feral</h3><p>If you find a cat who you think is feral, it is probably worth reaching out to your local cat rescue group. Many practice trap-neuter-return (TNR), an initiative that involves trapping feral cats, spaying or neutering them, and returning them to their outdoor habitats.</p><p>Found a feral kitten? If they're young enough, feral kittens can be socialized and turned into great pets, so it's worth taking the kitten in and either keeping it or bringing it to a shelter for care and adoption.</p><h2>What to Do If You've Found a Stray or Lost Cat</h2><p>Unlike feral cats, stray and lost cats can and should be rescued. Here's what you should do.</p><p>Step 1: Get the cat somewhere safe. Grab some cat-safe food and see if the cat will come to you readily. If it does, gently pick it up and bring it inside. Stray and lost cats should be kept separate from any other pets you have, so put it somewhere like a bathroom or spare bedroom where it will not have contact with other animals. Put some food and fresh water in there, and fill an empty aluminum baking pan with litter. If you need to trap the cat, try putting some food in a carrier and keeping a close eye on it.</p><p>Step 2: Check to see if there's a missing cat in your area. Call your local rescue groups and animal care and control, and check out websites like Tabby Tracker and Lost My Kitty to see if a lost cat has been reported in your area. If so, you may be able to reunite the cat with its caregiver pretty easily. Otherwise, bring the cat to a shelter or veterinarian's office to have it scanned for a microchip. The information attached to microchips is stored in national databases with owners' contact information.</p><p>Step 3: Put out a ""found cat"" ad. You still may be dealing with a lost cat even if the efforts above are fruitless. The same websites that allow you to search whether a cat has been reported missing also allow you to report when you've found one. Put a ""found cat"" ad on as many relevant sites as you can, including local community pages on social media. If you can't keep the cat in your home during this time, bring it to animal care and control. Ask how long the cat can stay there before it must be picked up, and check in regularly for updates. If the cat hasn't been picked up in the designated amount of time, pick it back up and bring it to a shelter.</p><p>Step Four: Find the cat a new home if necessary. If you've followed all of the steps and have had no luck reuniting the cat with its caregiver, then it will likely need a new home. You can adopt the cat yourself, or you can call around to nearby rescues and see if anyone can take it in. Beware of using Craigslist or other social sites to find the cat a home-it's always better to leave that task to a shelter.</p><p>Deciding if you should keep the cat once you've exhausted all other options is obviously personal and depends on your situation, but it's always worth considering. If you've bonded with the cat, are allowed to have cats in your home, and have the desire, it may just be meant to be. </p>",908

Some cats tolerate dressing up better than others, so don't force your animal into wearing something that makes them uncomfortable. They might only be content wearing a costume for a short amount of time, so have a camera ready to capture the moment.</p><p>Here are 15 Halloween costume ideas for cats.</p><h2>Pizza Cat</h2><p>MissMaddyMakes / Etsy</p><p>Did you hear that sound? It was the internet exploding because someone combined the internet's two favorite topics: cats and pizza. Create your own internet phenomenon-and get all those sweet social media likes-by DIYing this pizza cat costume. Simply cut brown, yellow, and red felt to the appropriate shapes and sizes, and hand-stitch or fabric glue the pieces together. If you're not very crafty, there are also pre-made pizza cat costumes available. </p><h2>Avo-Cato</h2><p>Willowthesquishycat / Instagram</p><p>If you have a clever kitty, they deserve a wonderfully ""punny"" costume. All you need to make this ""avo-cato"" costume is a piece of poster board and green crayons, markers, or nontoxic paint. Then, stick your cat's head through the center...and try not to laugh too hard at them.</p><h2>Jon Snow Cat</h2><p>CatCosplay / Imgur</p><p>Hairy, brooding, and mysterious all are adjectives that can be used to describe both Jon Snow of ""Game of Thrones"" and many cats. So why not combine the two? If your cat already has a moody outlook on life, outfit them in a simple black felt cape with an attached faux fur collar to match. </p><h2>Punk Rock Cat</h2><p>For those extra angsty cats, dressing as a punk rocker for Halloween makes sense. For this costume, cut a rectangular piece of fabric from some old denim jeans. Then, cut out armholes, and add a patch or piece of fabric with a punk rock band logo to transform them from house cat to mosh cat. </p><h2>Doctor Cat</h2><p>houseofkittyliciousness / Instagram</p><p>Cats don't have opposable thumbs, so in reality they'd be terrible doctors. But that doesn't mean kitties can't dress up as doctors for Halloween. If you're crafty, you can make your own version of a doctor costume with some cheap fabric, simple stitches, and stuffing. If you're not very crafty, you can buy a cat doctor costume. </p><h2>Nyan Cat</h2><p>Remember when Nyan Cat took over the internet back in 2011? Well, it's still funny-and even funnier when it's a real cat. Cut cardboard and construction paper to the correct shapes and sizes for your cat. Then, add multicolored streamers, and meow-meow-meow the day away. </p><h2>Doctor Who Cat</h2><p>cat_cosplay / Instagram</p><p>""Doctor Who"" fans, rejoice! You can transform your cat into Doctor Who-or should we say Docpurr Who? It might be tough to find duds small enough to fit your cat, but if you have some advanced sewing skills you can make a costume that mimics the character.</p><h2>Lion Cat</h2><p>Let your cat get back to their roots by dressing them as a fierce lion. It's incredibly easy to DIY a lion's mane with some faux fur trim. But there are many pre-made options, too. And because this is only a headpiece, you have a better chance of your cat tolerating wearing it versus a full ensemble.</p><h2>Sushi Cat</h2><p>feb21kate / Instagram</p><p>Cats notoriously love to eat fish, so play that up with a sushi costume theme. Whether you make your own sushi cat costume with layers of different-colored felt or buy it online, one thing's for certain: The irony of this costume should not be lost on anyone.</p><h2>Princess Leia Cat</h2><p>2 Cats and 1 Doll / YouTube</p><p>All you need is an old T-shirt and average sewing skills to dress your cat as the most fearless princess in the galaxy: Princess Leia of ""Star Wars."" Even if you're not so crafty, a tutorial from 2 Cats & 1 Doll shows how easy it is to make your kitty a pair of Princess Leia buns.</p><h2>Darth Vader Cat</h2><p>If your cat leans toward the Dark Side, a Darth Vader costume might be in order. You might need to use the Force to get your kitty to wear a Vader mask. But a laid-back cat might tolerate it at least long enough for you to snap a photo.</p><h2>Harry Potter Cat</h2><p>CatCosplay / Imgur</p><p>You don't need polyjuice potion to transform your cat into a feline Harry Potter. All you need is a baby's sweater, some felt (for the collar and tie), a pipe cleaner shaped into a lightning bolt, and wire bent into glasses. However, it might take a bit of magic to keep your cat still while you dress them. </p><h2>Hipster Cat</h2><p>kmcquaid / Instagram</p><p>Bring out your cat's general hipness by dressing them in a quintessential hipster outfit. Tie a bandana around their neck, and put a small beanie on their head. Some black-rimmed glasses are the finishing touch, though your cat might be too cool to wear them for long.</p><h2>Bat Cat</h2><p>Willowthesquishycat / Instagram</p><p>It doesn't get any easier-or more adorable-than dressing your cat as a bat for Halloween. You can buy pre-made bat wings or simply cut them out of black construction paper. Then, attach your DIY wings to your cat's collar with a black pipe cleaner. </p><h2>Business Cat</h2><p>Your cat might do a lot of sleeping on the job, but they can still dress like they mean business. For this costume, just make a simple collar with fabric or felt, and top it off with plastic-frame glasses. Hopefully your cat will keep them on long enough for their job ID photo.</p>",884
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/keep-cats-indoors-555124,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>Top Reasons to Keep Cats Indoors</h1>,"<h1>Top Reasons to Keep Cats Indoors</h1><p>Many cat lovers are now savvy that indoor cats are safer cats, while others still think that cats deserve the freedom to run in the great outdoors. When humans domesticated cats, we took on the responsibility for their health and welfare. Part of that responsibility is to keep cats safe and in good health. For those holdouts for letting cats roam free, consider these top reasons to keep cats indoors.</p><h2>To Monitor Your Cat's Urinary Tract/Bowel Health</h2><p>Observing a cat's painful attempts to poop, or finding blood and/or mucus in the feces in the fact is a red flag for constipation, bowel blockage, or megacolon.</p><h2>An Indoor Cat Is Relatively Safe from Many Diseases</h2><p>Cats allowed free access to the outdoors invariably come into contact with other cats.</p><p>Mice your cat may eat or bring home can also cause a host of other dangerous diseases.</p><p>Rarely mentioned, but equally serious is the possibility of skin cancer from over-exposure to the sun. White and other light-colored cats can develop squamous cell carcinoma, a serious, painful disease.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Do Not Get Hit by Cars</h2><p>According to one source, more cats are killed by cars annually than are euthanized in U.S. animal shelters. Even the most careful driver cannot avoid hitting a cat that runs across the street in front of a car. Even so-called ""safe"" country areas are no guarantee for cats. Country cats are not as car-savvy as their city brethren, and all it takes is one misjudgment of distance or speed.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Are Safe From Wildlife Dangers and Dog Packs</h2><p>Outdoor cats are below wildlife predators in the food chain, and they are sitting ducks for owls, raptors, coyotes, and native big cats. Dogs running in packs will consider a cat fair game; even one large dog can easily overpower and kill a cat.</p><p>Remember that some dogs are also bred to attack; they are not really to blame when their instinct takes over. Even with a full set of fangs and claws, the cat rarely has a chance when caught outside, and declawed cats are even more at risk.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Don't Create Neighbor Problems</h2><p>Even ""well-bred"" cats will venture into neighbors' yards when allowed to roam free, and the resultant neighborhood discord has in some cases caused cat owners to move. People who don't like cats will not tolerate cats using their gardens as litter boxes, and will sometimes resort to extreme measures to keep the cats out. At the very least, a neighbor may call the local animal control to pick up the ""stray"" cat.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Rarely Get Abscesses From Fighting</h2><p>Cats are very territorial and will defend their territory to the death if challenged by another cat. At the very least, these territorial battles often result in abscessed wounds, which can be deadly if not treated in time. There's also the chance, of course, of cats contracting FIV from deep bite wounds.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Are Safe From Human Abuse</h2><p>Freely-roaming cats are easy targets for gangs of youths with time on their hands, for cat-haters, who seek cats out for target practice, and for neighbors who would think nothing of killing a cat for trespassing on their property.</p><p>Although animal protection laws are beefing up, the prosecution will never bring a loved cat back to life. It's a well-known fact that serial killers often practice first with animals.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Can Get Plenty of Exercise</h2><p>Cats do get exercise, but they can get it safely with interactive toys, climbing towers, scratchings posts, and other indoor toys; all much safer than running from dogs or fighting with other cats. Remember also that there are safe compromises for the outdoor experience.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Are not a Danger to Wildlife</h2><p>Let's face it; cats are predators, and left to their own devices outdoors, will eventually chase and kill birds, rabbits, and other small wildlife. Most of us would rather not see our cats cast in a killer role, and keeping them indoors will help protect wildlife to some degree.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Don't Get Lost</h2><p>ocean yamaha / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>As outdoor cats widen their outdoor territories, they may become lost long enough to be ""rescued"" by other cat lovers, legitimate rescue groups, or picked up by animal control as strays. Statistics show that of ""owned"" cats turned in to shelters, only 3% are eventually relocated with their owners.</p><p>Collars can break, and even microchips do not guarantee a cat will not be adopted and kept as an indoor cat by someone else. Why take the chance?</p><h2>Indoor Cats Are Not Stolen</h2><p>phip_s / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>Bunchers are people who sell cats to laboratories for animal experimentation or research. Their prime source of cats is on the street. Even a cat sitting on his front lawn is fair game for a buncher. Other people pick up cats for use as ""bait"" for training fighting dogs. Both categories of cat-knappers are the lowest of the low, but they are out there.</p><p>So beware. Remember that an indoor cat is always safer.</p><h2>Indoor Cats Don't Freeze in Winter</h2><p>Weather conditions can change very rapidly, and mild weather can turn stormy and cold, sometimes with little notice. Cats can die quickly from hypothermia when left outside, particularly at night.</p><p>Don't gamble with your cats' lives. Keep them safely indoors, no matter what the weather outside.</p><h3>Watch Now: If Your Cat Could Text, They Would Say This</h3>",880

Although likes can vary from cat to cat, these eight kitty ""likes"" are a great place to start.</p><h2>Cats Love Taking Naps</h2><p>It's no secret that cats love to sleep. In fact, the average kitty sleeps for a whopping 12 to 16 hours per day! Because cats are nocturnal creatures, they snooze most of the day away-and who can blame them? Everyone loves a nice, long nap in a cozy, comfy spot.</p><p>Keep in mind, kittens and senior cats will spend more time sleeping than, say, an adolescent cat. But if you're worried that your cat is sleeping too much-or too little-talk to your vet about what's normal for his breed, age, activity level, and size.</p><h2>Cats Love Grooming and Being Groomed</h2><p>Did you know adult cats spend approximately half of their waking hours grooming? Clearly, grooming is an important part of a kitty's life!</p><p>Not every cat loves to be groomed by his humans, but if yours does, try brushing his fur with a natural bristle or rubber brush. It'll remove any residue from his fur and feel super relaxing, too.</p><h2>Cats Love Fresh, Nutritious Food</h2><p>the.tuxedo.cat / Instagram</p><p>It's unlikely that you'd want to dive into a big plate of spoiled food at dinnertime. The same goes for your cat. Stale and spoiled food doesn't just taste bad, either-it can grow mold or host multiple types of bacteria, like Salmonella and Staphylococcus, too.</p><p>Whenever you serve your kitty's meals, be sure to check the expiration dates on both wet and dry food. This will ensure you're only feeding her fresh, nutritious, and safe meals.</p><h2>Cats Love Running Water</h2><p>official / Instagram</p><p>If you have a cat, you know they'll try to drink water from running faucets whenever the opportunity presents itself. Fortunately, there are tons of drinking fountains-designed especially for cats-so they always have cool, fresh, running water available.</p><p>Believe it or not, some breeds of cats also like to play in water. If your cat loves to splash around, try filling up the bathtub or a kiddie pool with a few inches of water during her playtime. This activity will help her get a little bit of exercise and cool off on particularly hot days.</p><h2>Cats Love Scratching and Clawing</h2><p>One of the cats' basic instincts is to sharpen their claws by scratching and clawing different surfaces. They also happen to get a ton of joy from it, too.</p><p>In addition to sharpening their claws, scratching can help relax and rejuvenate cats. Think of it as the human equivalent to a nice, long stretch when your muscles are tired or achy. A quick scratch session on a cat tree or scratching post can wake a tired kitty up immediately.</p><h2>Cats Love Daily Playtime</h2><p>Playtime is serious business for cats, all the way from kittenhood to their senior years. It doesn't take much to keep a cat entertained-she'll play with anything from lint to tricked-out cat toys-but it is a vital part of their health and development. Not only does playtime hark back to their days in the wild when they had to stalk, hunt, and capture their prey, but it keeps them exercised, engaged, and happy, too.</p><p>There are literally hundreds of thousands of cat toys on the market, but your cat may like playing games, such as hide and seek, too. No matter your cat's choice of play, it's important to sneak in a few minutes daily.</p><h2>Cats Love Watching Birds</h2><p>It's not uncommon to see cats curled up on windowsills. Why? It's a prime bird watching location! Whether cats love to watch birds because they're prey or simply because the movement captures their attention, some cats can spend hours observing birds every day.</p><p>If your cat loves to curl up in windows, be sure to protect her skin from the sun's harsh rays, especially if she has light-colored fur. Try to limit her hours next to the window when the sun is strongest-between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.-and talk to your vet about kitty-approved sunscreens.</p><h2>Cats Love Their Humans</h2><p>hilanabekker / Instagram</p><p>Although cats are often depicted as solitary animals, they need love, attention, and companionship-and love to get it from their humans. The ways cats say ""I love you"" are just a little bit different than we humans.</p><p>Some signs your cat loves you include purring, bunting (or putting her head on you), sleeping on or near you, meowing, licking, and even sticking her butt in your face. Yes, really.</p>",828
55,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-bath-advice-553938,Cats > Getting Started,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>How to Bathe Your Kitten or Adult Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Bathe Your Kitten or Adult Cat</h1><h2>It's Worth the Effort to Keep Your Cat Healthy</h2><p>Kittens learn to lick themselves when they are two to four weeks old and adult cats spend up to 50 percent of their awake time grooming themselves. So why should you still give your cat a bath? A bath stimulates the skin and removes excess oil, dander, and shed hair. It also offers an opportunity to teach your cat that being handled even in unexpected ways won't hurt them. Cats will need to be touched by the vet, handled by vet techs, or cared for by house sitters and guests. Making the bath a pleasant experience helps cats ""generalize"" the event to future similar situations.</p><p>Positive experiences with prior baths are especially beneficial if you ever find yourself having to give your cat medicated baths as part of a treatment plan for skin diseases like ringworm or if your cat gets into something particularly nasty.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p>Some fastidious shorthaired cats may rarely if ever need a bath, while cats with longer hair often need a little more help with hygiene. Bathing too often can dry the skin, so try to avoid anything more frequent than every 4-6 weeks or so. Kittens accept baths most readily so start as soon as you adopt one, as long as it's at least 4 weeks old. Elderly cats or extremely ill cats are not as adaptable to environmental changes even when temporary. They may be stressed by bathing so follow your veterinarian's recommendation in these instances.</p><h2>What You Need</h2><p>Human shampoo (including those designed for babies) or dog products can be too harsh and dry the cat's skin, and in some case may be toxic.</p><h2>Prepare to Bathe Your Cat</h2><p>Before getting your cat wet, brush its fur thoroughly. As for you, wear old clothes and expect to get wet.</p><p>The bath area should be warm and draft-free. The bathtub will do, but you may be more comfortable if you can bathe your cat in a waist-high sink. Move all breakables out of reach and push drapes or shower curtains out of the way. Avoid anything (strong scents, scary objects, mirrors) that potentially frighten cats, so the bath is as pleasant as possible.</p><p>Assemble your shampoo, several towels, and a washcloth near the sink or tub, and run warm water before you bring in the cat. The cat bath temperature should be around body temperature, in other words pretty warm but not so hot that it's uncomfortable.</p><p>Place a towel or rubber mat in the bottom of the tub or sink. Cats hate the insecure footing of slippery surfaces and this will make it less stressful. Or, try standing the cat on a plastic milk crate so your cat can grip it with its paws. This also allows you to more easily wash the cat from both above and below.</p><p>Close the door to the bathing area, or you risk having a soapy cat escape.</p><h2>Bathing Kittens</h2><p>For small cats or kittens, use the double sink in the kitchen, two or more large roasting pans, or a couple of buckets or wastebaskets set in the bathtub. Fill each with warm water, then gently lower your cat (one hand supporting its bottom, the other beneath the chest) into the first container to get it wet. Most cats accept this method more readily than being sprayed.</p><p>Let your kitty stand on its hind legs and clutch the edge of the container as you thoroughly wet the fur. Then lift the cat out onto one of your towels, and apply the shampoo, using a damp but not soapy washcloth to clean its face.</p><p>After lathering, dip the cat back into the first container to rinse. Get as much soap off as possible before removing and sluice off excess water before thoroughly rinsing in subsequent containers of clean water.</p><h2>Choose Between the Adult Cat Dip or Spray Method</h2><p>Jumbo-size adult cats can be hard to dunk, and running water can be scary for them. Instead, you can use a ladle to dip water. If you have a spray nozzle on the sink, use a low force, with the nozzle close to the fur so the kitty doesn't see the spray.</p><p>Never spray in the face; use a damp wash rag to wipe down that area. Keep one hand on the cat at all times to prevent escapes. Rinse beginning at the neck and down the cat's back; don't neglect beneath the tail or on the tummy.</p><p>Wrap the clean cat in a dry towel. Shorthaired cats dry quickly, but longhaired felines may need two or more towels to blot away most of the water. If your cat tolerates or enjoys the blow dryer, use only the lowest heat setting and keep the dryer moving to avoid burns.</p><h2>Preventing Problems With Your Cat During a Bath</h2><p>Some cats will truly enjoy the bath and others will not. Remain patient and don't scold your cat during the bath. If your cat is really hating the bath, try plenty of praise, solicit some help, or rinse off the soap and try again next time. If bathing your cat at home seems too problematic, a professional groomer that is experienced with cats is your best bet for effective cleaning by a professional.</p><p>What is Humane?</p><p>The Special Needs of the Senior Cat.</p>",873
56,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-people-dont-like-cats-555642,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>Top 5 Reasons Some People Just Don t Like Cats</h1>,"<h1>Top 5 Reasons Some People Just Don't Like Cats</h1><p>For those who consider cats family members, it is almost inconceivable that some people dislike cats or actually may even hate them. But even though we may not understand why some people may dislike the traits that most cats share, there are still some logical reasons for cat avoidance.</p><h2>Cat Allergies</h2><p>It is understandable why people with allergies to cats refuse to be anywhere near them. They may not ""hate"" cats per se, but they may justifiably hate the way cat dander triggers their mild to severe allergy symptoms.</p><p>Cat hair and other pet hair are actually not the culprit; the triggers people react to are the coat-protective proteins secreted by the cat's skin. People with cat allergies may also be reacting to protein molecules that are secreted into the cat's saliva or urine.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is a widespread belief that cat allergy stems simply from floating ""physical dust and hair."" The general public lacks awareness of the true cause: a reaction that is chemical in nature, capable of inducing very strong reactions. Cat allergy can be so severe that it causes anaphylactic reaction much like the life-threatening allergies to nuts and other foods. It can even cause the closing off of airways, requiring emergency medical attention.</p><h2>Territory Ranges Beyond the Household</h2><p>Given the chance, most cats will opt to defecate outside in rich and deep garden soil, even if that soil is in a neighbor's yard. Outside cats will leave their droppings uncovered as a territorial marking to relay information to other cats in the area. Nearby households will not be spared, as cats do not understand property lines or other yard boundaries.</p><p>Cats will also prolifically spray urine against outside walls and doors of other dwellings in the neighborhood to mark their outside territories, especially if cats are known to be dwelling inside.</p><h2>Killing Birds</h2><p>Cats, being obligate carnivores, are predators. Whether the cat is indoor-only, free-roaming but owned, or feral and stray, birds and mice are a cat's favorite prey.</p><p>National groups such as the Alley Cats Allies and Alley Cat Rescue have established protocols to support feral cat colonies in managed care. The cats are trapped, neutered or spayed, and then released back into their colonies.</p><p>A vital part of all managed care for feral cats is feeding the cats, which precludes their need to kill wild birds for food. Alley Cat Rescue goes a step further in setting aside the kittens and partially tame young adults in their adoption center.</p><p>But cat owners can also do their part. Songbirds and brightly colored wild birds bring both audible and visual joy to cat owners' lives, and many will go to any lengths to protect them from their cats. Think about adding birdhouses and bird nesting material to your exterior surroundings, while at the same time providing more activities for the cats to engage in other than the wildlife. Cats do enjoy watching bird feeders through the window.</p><h2>Biting and Scratching</h2><p>Cats are able and willing to communicate both their likes and dislikes. They often communicate quite vocally, and sometimes even physically, with a swift swat of outstretched claws when too much petting overstimulates them.</p><p>Aggressive scratching and biting behaviors are learned very early in a cat's life, during kittenhood. Cats that are taught that human hands are playtoys will often bite their owners' hands when they become adults.</p><p>It may be that people who dislike cats had a bad experience with a young cat when they were young children themselves; an adult should always be present to teach both child and kitten about the safe limits of play. Many young families even give up their first cat because of this misunderstood juvenile scratching or biting behavior.</p><p>When you teach your cats that scratching and biting behaviors are not allowed, it may just serve as an example to your wary visitors that cats be re-taught how to not scratch and bite at any age.</p><h2>Tricky Relationships With Humans</h2><p>Some people dislike cats because they are fickle and aloof when it comes to relationships with their human housemates. If someone makes a cat uncomfortable or frightened, a cat will be sure to make it known with a hiss or a swat.</p><p>In comparison to subordinate and fun-loving dogs, cats may seem unappreciative. In nature, though, cats and dogs evolved very different lifestyles. Dogs evolved to live in family packs, as teamwork was needed to hunt large prey. Wild cats eat smaller prey and evolved to be lone hunters and fishers. And yet it is that very same independent nature of cats that makes them very adaptable to our changing environments and changing daily routines.</p><p>As long as cats are socialized to humans as kittens, cats can form close bonds with their humans. But when a self-directed independent cat acts in a standoffish manner, it is most often due to a new person coming into the household.</p><p>Even the shy cat is observant and assesses the relative safety of newcomers. Given time to learn, a cat will usually come around to accept them as a friend and trusted caregiver.</p>",836
57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/polydactyl-cats-4175908,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>7 Amazing Facts About Polydactyl Cats</h1>,"<h1>7 Amazing Facts About Polydactyl Cats</h1><p>Polydactyl cats are born with more than the usual number of toes on their paws. While most cats have five toes on their front paws and four toes on their back paws, polydactyl cats can have six (or more) on each paw.</p><p>Polydactyly is a genetic abnormality that results in extra digits and is more common in certain geographic regions of the world compared to others. It can affect any cat breed, male or female, big or small.</p><p>Read on to learn more about the genetic factors that contribute to polydactyly and to check out some adorable photos of polydactyl cats.</p><h2>Polydactyly Is Caused by a Genetic Mutation</h2><p>Polydactyly is caused by a genetic mutation in a dominant gene and usually results in the formation of anywhere between four to seven toes on a kitty's paws. The front paws are most often affected by polydactyly, but it can also occur on the hind paws; it's extremely rare for a cat to have polydactyly on all four paws.</p><p>For the most part, polydactyly is harmless to a cat's health and wellness. It can make trimming your cat's nails a bit more labor-intensive-and if you've ever trimmed your cat's nails, you know how difficult it is-but otherwise, there are plenty of happy, healthy kitties with a few extra toes.</p><p>It's important to note that feline radial hypoplasia, a condition that is often confused with polydactyly, can be extremely detrimental to a cat's health. Like polydactyly, feline radial hypoplasia causes the development of extra toes. The major difference is that the extra toes develop immediately next to the cat's normal toes, resulting in extremely large, flat feet. If cats with feline radial hypoplasia are bred, it can cause severe paw deformities in subsequent generations.</p><h2>Some Polydactyl Cats Have ""Mittens""</h2><p>""Mitten paws"" occur when a polydactyl cat's extra toes form in the middle of the paw, giving it a thumb-like-or mitten-like-appearance. Although these extra digits resemble thumbs, they aren't opposable.</p><h2>Polydactyly Can Actually Benefit Some Cats</h2><p>Polydactyl cats' toes aren't just cute-they provide some benefits to kitties, too. Because polydactyl cats have wider, larger paws, they're better able to balance on various surfaces, climb, hunt, and capture their prey.</p><p>If you have a polydactyl cat, be sure to buy it a scratching post or board. Those extra toes can seriously do a number on your furniture.</p><h2>Polydactyl Cats Are Considered Lucky</h2><p>Like many kinds of cats (black cats and calico cats included) that were believed to bring good luck to sailors, polydactyl cats are no exception. Back in the day, polydactyl cats were a common sight on long journeys by ship.</p><p>With the help of their large, wide paws, polydactyl cats made excellent mousers and could keep the ship's supplies vermin-free. Plus, their paws helped them balance on rocky seas.</p><p>Polydactyl cats are most commonly found in Western England, Wales, Canada, and the Eastern United States, and their prevalence in those regions is often credited to their days on trans-continental ships. It's believed that polydactyl cats in England were transported across the Atlantic Ocean where they bred with non-polydactyl cats and proliferated the genetic trait.</p><h2>Ernest Hemingway Loved Polydactyl Cats</h2><p>Have you ever wondered why polydactyl cats are sometimes referred to as Hemingway cats? Well, it's because Ernest Hemingway them. After he was gifted a white, polydactyl cat named Snow Ball by a ship's captain, Ernest Hemingway developed a serious affection for these multi-toed kitties.</p><p>After his death in 1961, his home in Key West, Florida was transformed into a museum and a home for his beloved cats. Currently, the kitty colony is home to about 50 descendants of his original pack of cats-and about half of them are polydactyl.</p><h2>The Condition Was Very Common Among Maine Coon Cats</h2><p>Because Maine coon cats originated in Maine's harsh, snowy conditions, they've evolved to have large, insulated paws that serve as tiny, built-in snow boots. And, lucky for Maine coons, polydactyly was very common in the breed-at one time about 40 percent of Maine coons had extra digits. Why's it lucky? Polydactyly gave Maine coons larger, wider paws with more insulation to traverse the snowy conditions.</p><p>Today, polydactyly has been bred out of many Maine coon cats, but the breed polydactyl Maine coon is still recognized by some cat fanciers.</p><h2>One Cat Holds the World Record for Most Toes</h2><p>According to the Guinness Book of World Records, a polydactyl ginger tabby named Jake holds the world record for the most toes. Clocking in at a whopping 28 toes, Jake had seven toes on each paw-with each toe having its own claw, pad, and bone structure.</p>",808
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cats-and-car-trips-3385078,Cats > Getting Started,<h1>How to Take a Car Trip With Your Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Take a Car Trip With Your Cat</h1><p>It's no secret that most cats hate car rides. During their lives, most cats only take occasional car trips. Car rides are often just to the veterinarian, leaving the cat with a negative impression of the car. Plus, people don't tend to take their cats on car rides very often, so they may never get used to the feeling of it.</p><p>If short trips are stressful for your cat, then long trips will probably be worse. If you are planning a long car trip with your cat, you may feel overwhelmed and worried, especially if you know your cat gets stressed out in the car. While you may never be able to get your cat to love car rides, you might be able to get him used to them enough to reduce his stress.</p><h2>How to Get Your Cat Used to the Car</h2><p>Chances are your cat associates car rides with vet visits. Most cats get very stressed at the vet, so this association can make car rides dreadful for everyone. Don't let this keep you from taking your cat to the vet for annual or biannual check-ups. Instead, start practicing the routine of a car until your cat starts to relax. This process can eventually reduce the stress associated with car trips.</p><p>First, begin leaving your cat carrier out with the door open so your cat can explore it. Put a soft bed or blanket inside along with a favorite toy and/or some extra tasty treats. Don't close your cat inside yet, just let him get used to it. Offer additional treats if he gets to the point where he is willing to remain in the carrier for a few minutes. If your cat is worried about the carrier, consider spraying the inside with a feline pheromone like Feliway to promote a sense of calm. However, do not directly spray your cat with pheromones. You can also try putting some catnip inside the carrier if this is something your cat enjoys.</p><p>Next, practice closing your cat in the carrier as if you are about to go for a car ride. Pick up the carrier and walk around with it. Afterward, let your cat out and offer valuable treats. Increase the length of time you walk around with your cat in the carrier. Once your cat starts to relax, try bringing the carrier out to the car, but don't go anywhere. Reward them with another high-value treat.</p><p>Then, add small trips to nowhere. Take a ride around the house, then bring your cat back home and let him out of the carrier. Once again, offer plenty of yummy treats.</p><p>Gradually increase the length of car trips without using your cat too far. If your cat is vocalizing loudly or panting, then the trips became too long too quickly. Slow down the process and see if your cat adjusts.</p><h2>Preparing for a Long Trip</h2><p>If you plan to take a longer trip, perhaps a few hours or more, then it's best to get your cat ready in advance.</p><p>Before the actual trip, be sure to get some things together. Make sure your cat is wearing an easy release collar or harness with identification. A microchip is also important in case your cat gets loose or lost and the collar or harness falls off. Make a list of emergency vets along the way in case your cat becomes ill.</p><p>The night before travel, put your cat in a small room with the carrier, a litter box, food, and water. This will make it easier to get your cat in the carrier the next day. Plus, it can help your cat adjust to a smaller space.</p><p>If the trip is more than two or three hours long, then your cat will need a break. Bring a litter pan, food, and water along with you on the trip. Take a break every two or three hours so your cat can relax, eat and drink, and use the litter box.</p><h2>What to Do If Your Cat Won't Get Used to the Car</h2><p>Some cats will never be able to calm down for car rides, despite your best efforts. These cats may benefit from calming supplements and/or medications. Talk to your vet about the best options for your cat.</p><p>Nutritional supplements like Solliquin can help your cat relax without the use of pharmaceutical medications. Test this out in advance before you venture out for a long trip.</p><p>If supplements are ineffective, then it might be time to try a stronger medication. Sedation may be the best option for the most anxious cats.</p><h2>When You Arrive at your Destination</h2><p>Whether you are moving to a new home or taking your cat on vacation, be aware that your cat needs time to adjust to his new environment. Gradually introduce your cat to his new space until he feels comfortable. Be patient as this can take time.</p>",808

From those random bursts of energy, to teeth chattering, to putting their butts in faces, cats are not lacking in the strange behaviors department. Out of all of their strange behaviors, however, one just might win the title of strangest-and has become an internet phenomenon, too.</p><p>""If it fits, I sits"" (or ""If I fits, I sits"") refers to the act of kitties squeezing themselves into tiny spaces, like boxes, sinks, shoes, bowls, or even flower vases. Lucky for them, their super flexible spines allow them to squeeze into some seriously small (and strange) spots. But why do cats like to chill in confined spaces? The most common theory is that it makes them feel safe, protected and comfortable-if the sides of a box, basket, or bowl are touching their body, a predator can't get 'em. Makes sense, right?</p><p>Natural instincts aside, ""if it fits, I sits"" has graced the internet with some pretty awesome photos. Read on to see 10 cats who answered the call of the wild by jamming their bodies into tiny spaces.</p><h2>Kitties in Cardboard</h2><p>From shipping boxes, to pizza boxes, to shoe boxes, there isn't a single cardboard box a kitty hasn't liked to curl up in. In fact, your cat probably loves a good ol' cardboard box more than the 100% organic, natural latex, and memory foam cat bed that cost more than your own mattress. </p><h2>The Water-Free Bath Time Kitty</h2><p>Sure, many cats don't like to get wet and some absolutely taking a bath but no one ever said anything about bathroom or kitchen sinks. They're actually the perfect, cat-sized spot to curl up, get comfy, and totally get in the way of your morning routine. </p><h2>The Interior Decorating Cat</h2><p>juniper / Instagram</p><p>Baskets are a super common accessory in the interior decorating world.

You heard it here first: A kitty cuddled up in a handwoven basket is going to be this year's biggest (and cutest) decorating trend. </p><h2>The Not-So-Helpful Feline Helper</h2><p>Doing yard work in the hot summer sun can be seriously hard work, but having a helper can save some sweat and back pain. Unless, of course, that helper decides to take a nice snooze on top of your garden hose. </p><h2>The Cutest Kitty Birthday Present</h2><p>What's better than celebrating your birthday and being showered with love, happiness, and thoughtful gifts? If one of those gifts happens to be an adorable cat!</p><p>(Psst: We don't recommend giving animals as gifts unless you've discussed it extensively(!) with your partner, family, or roommates. You have to be 1000% certain the recipient is ready to take on a pet before you surprise them with one!)</p><h2>Picky Punk Rock Kitty</h2><p>When you're a punk rock kitty, you have to be choosy with your sits locations. A Backstreet Boys DVD box set case? No way. A Nike shoe box? Never. Really, besides a Vans box, there's only one other type of shoe box this punk cat would be seen squeezing himself into: Doc Martens.</p><h2>The Baby Doll Cat</h2><p>Whether they just want to be closer to the baby or are jealous of all the attention the tiny humans get, it's common for cats to curl up in a crib, car seat, or stroller. But if taken out on the street, this kitty could bring a whole new meaning to the term ""Crazy Cat Lady."" All she needs is a bonnet and pacifier to really take it to the next level. </p><h2>The Feline World Traveler</h2><p>Doesn't it seem like your pets just when you're going on vacation? Curling up in your purse or luggage, like this cat, is one way to ensure you won't go galavanting around the globe without him.</p><h2>The Chef Kitty</h2><p>If you've ever worked in a restaurant kitchen or helped your mom in the kitchen you know any good chef has a permanent frown. The same rings true for this culinary cat, who prefers to relax in a salad bowl. </p><h2>The Chore-Completing Kitty</h2><p>Take a moment to reflect on how difficult it was to get your chores done when you were a kid.

For pet parents looking for a special furry friend to spend their days with, there is always an influx of adorable felines waiting to find forever homes. </p><p>If you've been thinking about bringing a kitty home, June is a great month to do so, as many rescue groups and shelters may have special events this month. Or, if you're not able to welcome a new member into your family right now, there are other ways to celebrate this month and support shelter cats.</p><p>Read on to find out all the ways you can help.</p><h2>Attend Pop-Up Events Hosted by Rescue Groups</h2><p>Many adoption events for shelter cats take place at local pet stores, parks, and other types of locations. These events are usually held by rescue groups that want to make sure their animals go to a good home.</p><p>At pop-up events, there is an emphasis on getting to know the individual animals with volunteers available to ask questions, and adoption can be more immediate than they'd usually be at the regular shelters.</p><h2>Visit the Local Animal Care and Control Shelter</h2><p>Rescue groups are often actively coordinating adoptions with their groups of animals, but shelters, on the other hand, can also be overwhelmed with volumes of pets that need homes. </p><p>Outside of events, you may find animals that could use a pet owner's love here. Unlike at pet stores, animals at shelters are most in need of homes and may be more at risk for euthanasia if they are not adopted, Fox said. Finding a cat that has been in the shelter for a while may be the best way to make that pet's day-and life-this month.</p><h2>Volunteer With or Support Your Local Shelter</h2><p>If you're not looking to adopt, there are other ways you can help animals find their forever homes. Volunteering at a shelter can be a great way to help care for cats waiting for homes.</p><p>""Many times this can be as fun and easy as playing with them to help socialize them and give them exercise,"" Fox said. </p><p>If you don't volunteer with your time, you can also financially support shelters; most shelters and rescue groups are in need of donations. This can be a direct monetary donation or a donation of supplies such as food, litter, kitten milk replacer, towels, toys, beds, and more. </p><p>Many rescue groups have wish lists of what supplies they need so be sure to ask about that as well. Rescue groups and shelters alike often have cats throughout their extensive foster networks looking for homes too, so the foster system may also be a great avenue.</p><h2>Do Your Research Before You Adopt</h2><p>It can be easy to idealize a pet, but in reality, the responsibility can be heavy if a new owner is unprepared, Fox said.</p><p>""Be sure to think about all that a new cat will need before adopting, as it can be easy to make an impulsive decision to adopt when you see an adorable fuzzy kitten or meet your four-legged soul mate at an adoption event,"" Fox said. </p><p>Fox advised purchasing basic supplies for your prospective new cat prior to adoption, so you are prepared and well-informed about caring for your new cat. Local shelters often offer educational opportunities to help you have all the information you need pre-adoption.</p><p>It's also a good idea to do lots of research about what cats need and if your home/lifestyle is compatible with one before you bring one in is also a good idea.</p><h2>Consider Fostering Cats</h2><p>If you're not adopting, maybe fostering might be a better fit for you. A step beyond volunteer work at the shelter is to be part of the networks that rescue groups and shelters rely on for their foster parents needs.</p><p>Many cat parents started off by helping shelters temporarily take care of their pets before deciding to adopt the cat or before deciding to adopt a different one.</p><p>As a foster parent, your job is to take care of a cat in the interim before they are adopted out and play a major role in helping them be ready. With so many cats and so few hands to go around in helping care for them, this is a great way to be a bridge between their life in the crowded shelter and their comfortable permanent new home.</p><h2>Consider Adopting a Senior Cat</h2><p>While tiny kittens are adorable and obviously appealing because of their infectious energy and playfulness, Fox also recommends giving the older felines a chance as well.</p><p>""I always recommend looking at the adult and senior cats too since they tend to be overlooked yet often make the best matches,"" she said. Kitten care can be overwhelming since they tend to get into lots of mischief and can't be left alone for long periods of time. Adult and senior cats are often lower maintenance and you know more about their personalities.""</p><p>When selecting a cat in a shelter, often senior cats are already socialized and used to humans, so they may be a great fit for first time cat owners. At the same time, they also can fit in well if your home is already full of other furry friends. </p><p>""If you know you really want a good mouser, lap cat, or a cat that will be compatible with your other pets, a shelter or rescue group will be able to direct you to an adult cat that fits your wish list,"" Fox said. </p><p>Senior cats are often especially difficult to home, but keep in mind cats live a very long time (sometimes into their 20's!). A senior cat can have lots of life left and lots of love to give. </p><p>Above all, you can feel especially good about rescuing a kitty who needs love the most; he/she may not be as ""obvious"" a choice as a younger kitten, but also needs just as much attention and care.</p>",972
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/create-a-safe-room-for-your-new-cat-5323309,Cats > Getting Started > Cat Adoption,<h1>How to Create a Safe Room for Your Cat </h1>,"<h1>How to Create a Safe Room for Your Cat </h1><p> Dr.</p><p>When you adopt a new cat or kitten, it can take them a little while to adjust to their new home. One way to help with this transition is to set up a ""safe room"" in your house. This is a place where your new kitty can hang out until it feels more comfortable. </p><h2>Why Your Cat Needs a Safe Room</h2><p>Cats can be shy creatures, even under the best of circumstances. Kitties coming from hectic shelter or rescue environments might be suffering from some residual stress and anxiety. Even outgoing cats can benefit from having a safe room, which allows the cat to ease into new surroundings slowly by exploring at their own pace. A great big house (or even a smaller apartment) can seem enormous to a cat. One room is less intimidating and can make a cat feel secure. </p><p>Safe rooms are especially helpful if you already have one or more cats at home, because they allow the newcomer to be slowly introduced to your resident cats. Cats are territorial. They can become adversarial or aggressive if you try to force introductions. Most cats can eventually learn to get along, if allowed to get to know each other slowly on their own terms. </p><h2>How to Choose a Safe Room</h2><p>It's helpful to choose the room and get it set up before you bring your new kitty home. A safe room should be a small space, preferably with a door. A bathroom, large closet, or smaller guest room are good choices for safe rooms. Avoid choosing rooms that are loud or that you need to use a lot (for instance, the laundry room). </p><p>Look around the room to identify any hiding places the cat might try to squeeze into-such as behind furniture-and try to block them off, so the cat can't hide some where you can't reach it. Also, check the safe room for any potential dangers. Lock away cleaning chemicals, hide exposed electrical cords, tie up pull cords on blinds, and remove any dangerous houseplants or flowers.</p><h2>What to Put in Your Cat's Safe Room</h2><p>In the safe room, there should be a litter box, food and water dishes, soft blankets or a cozy bed, a scratcher, and a variety of toys. You can also add some cat grass to nibble or sprinkle a little catnip on a blanket for your kitty to enjoy. Place the litter box and food dishes at opposite ends of the room; cats do not like to eat close to the area where they pee and poop.</p><p>Having a hiding spot can make a shy or scared cat feel more comfortable, so you might consider adding a small cardboard box with a blanket for your new cat to sleep in. This gives the cat a place to hide but still allows you to access to it.</p><h2>How to Use a Safe Room</h2><p>When you bring your cat home, bring it in the room and place it gently on the ground. If he cowers or tries to hide, don't force any interactions. Instead, sit on the floor and quietly observe your cat and talk to it. Speak in a low, soothing voice. After a while, leave your cat alone and close the door to the safe room to give it time to explore on its own. </p><p>Come visit your cat in the room at regular intervals, always letting it come to you. It can help to bring some treats or try to engage your cat with play by waving a feather wand. If you have no other cats in the home, you can leave the door open and let your cat come and go as it pleases, allowing it to explore the rest of the house on its own terms. </p><p>If you have other cats in the house, keep the door closed initially. Your resident kitties will probably come over to sniff under the door. You might hear some hissing, growling, or yowling as the cats smell each other. This is normal and is no indication of how they might get along in the future once they are used to each other. </p><h2>How Long to Use a Safe Room</h2><p>Some outgoing cats, especially those that are the only cat in the house, may only need to use a safe room for one or two days. If you have other cats, it may be a good idea to keep them separated for up to a week or even longer, depending on how things are going. If your new cat is eating and drinking well and seems happily engaged with play and interaction with you, it might be time to end the confinement. </p><p>To gauge how well multiple cats are getting along, you can try opening the door and watching the interactions. As long as your new cat wants to come out and explore, and as long none of the cats are engaging in aggressive or bullying behavior with the other cats, you can let the new cat integrate into the household at his own pace. If you feel your new cat is being bullied by your other cat or cats, go back to using the safe room for a few more days, then try again.</p><p>If your cats are showing aggression or just not getting along after two to four weeks, reach out to your vet for help. You might need the assistance of an animal behaviorist to help work things out. </p>",899
62,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-to-adopt-an-older-cat-4160026,Cats > Getting Started > Cat Adoption,<h1>6 Reasons Why You Should Adopt an Older Cat</h1>,"<h1>6 Reasons Why You Should Adopt an Older Cat</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>When most people think about getting a new cat, they think about adopting an adorable kitten (or two), not an older cat. But there are plenty of reasons why you should at least consider adopting an adult or senior feline and not instantly fall for the appeal of a cute kitten.</p><h2>Older Cats Are Cleaner</h2><p>Kittens tend to be very energetic and play with not only toys but also inside their litter box. This means that they may kick litter out or run around their box like a racetrack while learning what the box is for, leaving the litter mess for you to clean up. Adult cats are typically already used to their litter box and do not like to play in it after they have buried their waste. Sure, they may still track litter out of the box, but they are not as messy as their kitten counterparts.</p><p>Older cats also self-clean better than kittens. Kittens don't lick themselves as much as adult cats do, so you may find yourself cleaning your kitten with baby wipes and fine-toothed combs to get debris off of them. Older cats do not typically need your help with regular grooming, unless they have long hair, because they will naturally keep themselves clean with their abrasive tongues.</p><p>Kittens, especially ones that are switching foods, recently weaned, or infested with intestinal parasites, are more likely to develop diarrhea than older cats. Kittens have dietary changes within the first couple of years of life that older cats do not typically experience, and these dietary changes can cause some loose stools. Loose stools usually mean more clean-up on both your kitten's hind end and the litter box, as well as odors for you to manage.</p><h2>Older Cats Aren't Teething</h2><p>Kittens have baby teeth that need to fall out before their adult teeth come in. To aid in the removal of these baby teeth, kittens will chew and teethe on items much like a human child does. Wires, shoelaces, furniture, and more are all at risk for being chewed on, so it should be expected that a kitten may cause some damage with their teeth. Older cats, on the other hand, already have adult teeth and are no longer teething. </p><h2>You Get What You're Looking at With an Older Cat</h2><p>Older cats are already fully grown when they are adopted, whereas kittens are still growing and changing. You may be surprised to get a long-haired cat when you really wanted a short-haired one, but if you adopt an older cat, you'll know what you're getting when it comes to their appearance.</p><h2>Older Cats Cause Less Trouble</h2><p>Just like human children, kittens tend to cause more trouble than adults. Kittens are curious and mischievous and seem to get into things they shouldn't, knock things off countertops, eat things that aren't edible, and exhaust you. While not every cat outgrows this behavior, older cats tend to sleep more and don't wear you out as much as a kitten does.</p><h2>Older Cats Are Better for Children</h2><p>The smaller something is, the more easily it can be broken by a child, and cats are no exception. Kittens are more fragile than an older cat. Kittens can fall or be dropped, get stepped on accidentally, or squeezed too tightly in a hug, but older cats are hardier, less breakable by children, and know how to get out of the way to avoid being stepped on. Older cats will often be more amenable to being petted, something children want to do with a cat, and kittens tend to be too wiggly to want to sit still and be stroked. Keep in mind that every cat is different, so a slow introduction to excited children may be best.</p><h2>Older Cats Need You</h2><p>If you still haven't been convinced that adopting an older cat is a good idea, then keep in mind that you may be their last chance for a home. Kittens are cute and get adopted very easily. Older cats are less likely to be adopted and run the risk of living out their lives in a shelter or foster home or even being euthanized if they don't get a home. It usually isn't the fault of the adult cat for ending up without a family. Sometimes elderly people need to live in nursing homes that don't allow cats, human ailments such as asthma or allergies make it difficult to care for a cat, or the previous owners simply couldn't afford to care for a pet. Older stray cats may have never had a home to begin with and are worth taking a chance on, too.  </p>",807
63,https://www.thesprucepets.com/before-you-adopt-a-cat-555302,Cats > Getting Started > Cat Adoption,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>Considerations Before Adopting Your First Cat</h1>,"<h1>Considerations Before Adopting Your First Cat</h1><p>If you're thinking about adopting a cat, there are many considerations and some initial decisions to be made about a cat's age, gender, breed, background, overall health, and condition of need. Also, it is common for house cats to live up to twenty years, so it is important to be serious about the commitment and to do your homework ahead of time.</p><h2>Commitment</h2><p>Think seriously about the commitment you'll be making in taking on a cat. Cats are sentient beings, and a cat deserves to be seen as your family member. Bringing a cat into your home will be a responsibility for the lifetime of the cat, requiring you to provide healthy food, safety, love, companionship, and veterinary care both in good times and in bad.</p><p>However, if you've wanted a cat for some time and think the time is right, discuss it with the other members of the household. You all will need to share this commitment since the cat will view you all as active members of its family.</p><h2>Age of the Cat</h2><p>Thinking about a cat means deciding between a kitten, an adult cat, or a senior cat. Although they are extremely cute, attending to kittens requires a lot of time and attention. Kittens will knead pillows as they would their mother's belly when nursing. This may start some clawing behavior on upholstery or leather furniture. </p><p>Kittens, like puppies, benefit from having a litter of mates for playing, cuddling, and for providing interesting games when no humans are home. So if you want a kitten, it might be best to have two that can socialize as siblings. Young kittens don't always get full training from mom on using the litter box, but two cats together can sometimes help influence each other in this regard. </p><p>Kids who interact with a kitten are bound to get scratched by a cat that is not yet socialized, and the child needs to be mature enough to understand this normal learning stage. Seniors may be better matched to a more mature cat. A cat that is used to quiet napping on the TV or other warm heat source or one that is happy being petted in a person's lap may be the better choice. </p><h2>Choosing a Rescue Cat</h2><p>When searching for a first cat, your initial first stop should be the humane shelters and cat rescue organizations. These groups have large numbers of beautiful, adoptable cats and kittens. If you are dead set on a cat of a specific breed, there are many breed rescue organizations to explore.</p><p>Usually, a shelter has already attended to the spay/neuter, the initial shots, and a veterinary clearance exam. If the cat's original situation left it with any medical challenges due to poor nutrition or neglect, these have usually already begun to be addressed by the shelter. You may get to play a final role in nursing your rescue back to full health, creating an initial bond between you both.</p><p>When picking a cat of any age, try to let the cat pick you as well. Spend some quiet time on the floor, giving the cat some other options in the room; if they choose you over others, that's a good sign. If multiple kittens are being considered at once, sit quietly and see which one comes to you.</p><p>Note that if you choose any of the scaredy-cats in the corner, be ready to commit a few weeks to show them that they are safe without crowding them. Once they get used to you and their overall anxiety subsides, they may be extremely loyal pets. </p><h2>Additional Cats</h2><p>We are social animals, so it seems natural to us that our cats would enjoy socialization, too. With few exceptions, though, the adult wild and domestic cats lead mostly solitary lives. They can be happy in groups, but they don't automatically seek companionship with other cats the same way dogs do. Before you decide to add a second cat to your home, ask yourself if your cat needs a friend and if you are prepared to meet the needs of multiple cats.</p><p>There are two important factors to consider before adopting a second cat: your current cat's age and personality. An older cat's worst nightmare is having a young, energetic, and insatiable playmate as a companion, but a young or middle-aged cat may be more receptive to the presence of a kitten or even another adult cat.</p><p>In considering your original cat's personality, your shy cat could be overwhelmed by a bossy cat, and your bossy house cat may be likely to bully a shy newcomer. It is possible to successfully introduce cats. Sometimes adding a cat to the family is unavoidable. If you're getting married, for example, and if you both have cats, then the merger is a must.</p><p>If you're adopting your first cat and you think you'd prefer to get a pair, the best approach is to adopt two kittens from the same litter or to adopt an already bonded pair of adults.</p>",824

65,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-name-your-cat-4773711,Cats > Getting Started > Cat Names,<h1>How to Name Your Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Name Your Cat</h1><h2>Some Pointers for Making a Sensible Name Choice</h2><p>Bringing home a newly adopted cat or kitten can be a super exciting time. It can also be overwhelming between making sure you have considered everything, gathering all the gear you need, figuring out vets and insurance, beginning litter training, and finding potential cat sitters.</p><p>With all these important things to think about, trying to be creative and come up with a good name for your new family member can prove a challenge. You want to pick something that all family members agree on, and something that won't require extensive explanations when you refer to your cat in front of others.</p><p>Below are some of our top tips when it comes to figuring out how to name your cat.</p><h2>Don't Rush Into Selecting a Name</h2><p>Remember that you could be using this name for more than 15 years! If you haven't picked one before your new cat arrives, it is not a disaster. It is much better to have a delay in selecting a name than allowing them to get used to a name, and then changing it a few weeks in, just as they are getting used to it.</p><h2>Don't Over-Complicate It</h2><p>Pick a name that is simple and easy to say. If your name is too complicated, your cat will likely get confused. You could also end up feeling silly shouting their name when you want them to come to you.</p><p>If you do opt for a long name because it has some personal significance, then be ready to use an abbreviated version for everyday use. If you are a fan of for example, and want to call your cat Samwise Gamgee, then using Sam would be simpler and easier.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>When naming your cat, go for a name that is two syllables or less. More than two syllables or tough pronunciations could result in your cat becoming confused and never learning their name properly.</p><h2>Consider the Other Names in the Household</h2><p>Try not to pick something that sounds too similar to anyone else living in the house, two or four-legged. If you have a dog that is named Joe, then picking the name Mo for your cat could cause confusion when you are trying to get the attention of just one of them.</p><h2>Don't Get Too Funny</h2><p>You may think it is hilarious to call your cat a borderline-inappropriate name, but don't forget that you have to use this name then when registering with your vet. It will be called out in the waiting area, and you will have to tell your pet sitter, work colleagues, and family members what your cat is called, too.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Be careful you don't unwittingly select something that could be racially, culturally, or sexually offensive. A quick online search of your intended name will reveal whether your supposedly clever name is actually rude or offensive to others.</p><h2>Consider Their Personality</h2><p>By waiting until the cat arrives to name them, you'll have a chance to see what their personality is like, and this may inspire a name choice. If they are a small cat with a feisty personality, maybe you will want to go for something like Bruiser. If they are a big clown, maybe you will want to go with Goofy.</p><h2>Consider Their Appearance</h2><p>Some cats may have unique markings or certain things about their appearance that inspire a name choice. If they are a bald Sphynx, maybe you will want to go with Yul, after the famous bald actor. If they are a ginger tabby, maybe you will want to go with Rusty or Ginger.</p><h2>Looking for Further Inspiration?</h2><p>Aside from naming your cat based on their personality or appearance, there are lots of other options for inspiration if you are struggling.</p><h3>Favorite Famous Figures</h3><p>If you have a favorite character from the screen or literature or a character from history inspires you, this might influence your choice. In recent years, for example, cats being named after characters has become increasingly common.</p><h3>Hobbies</h3><p>Are you a fan of a particular sports team or player? Maybe you are an enthusiastic gardener and want to name your cat after your most loved small flower; Daisy, for example.</p><p>Names can be inspired by hobbies, fandoms, studies, or even a favorite food or drink (or wine): It is not unusual to hear of a cat being called Rioja or Merlot.</p><h3>What About a Nostalgic Name?</h3><p>Picking something that brings back fond memories can attach more meaning to a name. Maybe you want to name them after a much loved holiday destination, or after a person you were close to and have lost touch with. The name could also be something fun, like the name of your favorite candy when you were growing up.</p><h2>Above All Else, Pick a Name You Like</h2><p>Don't stress too much about the small stuff. If your cat responds well to the name and you like it, really, that is all that matters. Your cat won't mind if it is overly common, extremely unique, or one that other people may find odd.</p>",823

67,https://www.thesprucepets.com/unique-male-cat-names-4767120,Cats > Getting Started > Cat Names,<h1>15 Unique Male Cat Names</h1>,"<h1>15 Unique Male Cat Names</h1><p>There is nothing wrong with popular cat names like Sooty, Tiger and Oscar, but, sometimes, standing out from the crowd and picking from more unique male cat names can be a good thing.</p><p>Bringing home an adopted cat or new kitten can be such an exciting and overwhelming time. It can be hard to be struck by inspiration when you are focussed on getting your cat settled into their new home.</p><p>Our list of unique male cat names will, hopefully, offer up some ideas to spark the imagination.</p><h2>Birba</h2><p>Do you have a cat that is a little monkey and always getting up to mischief? They could be well suited to the cute name Birba, which means scoundrel or rascal in Italian.</p><h2>Bryer</h2><p>If you have a cat that loves everyone and is full of sweet-tempered affection, then you couldn't pick a better name than Bryer. This Canadian based name means gentle and sweet.</p><h2>Bugatti</h2><p>For those car enthusiasts out there, then Bugatti could be a fun name for your cat. It would be especially apt if they are a speed demon that has bundles of energy and wants to play all the time. Bugatti cars are regularly in the top ten fastest cars in the world.</p><h2>Caleb</h2><p>If your cat is unfailingly loyal, then Caleb may be the perfect name for them. This is a Hebrew name, and it signifies faithfulness, devotion and also courage too.</p><h2>Carbonel</h2><p>If you are feeling nostalgic for a childhood in the mid 21st century and you have a very regal-looking cat, then Carbonel could be a great name choice, especially if they are black. This was the name of the speaking cat in the children's books by Barbara Sleigh. If you have young children, they would also no doubt love being read the stories that inspired the name of their cat!</p><h2>Gandalf</h2><p>For fans of classic fantasy literature, you can't go wrong with a character name from Lord of the Rings. What better name than Gandalf, in honor of the main wizard in the novel. It may not be as unique as some of the other names on this list, but it is one that would suit a white or grey cat with a wise character.</p><h2>Hypnos</h2><p>Cats are often named after greek or nordic gods. It is not uncommon (especially after the popularity of the Marvel Movies) to hear of cats being called Loki or Thor. If you have a cat that is lazy and loves to lounge around all day, the more unusual choice of Hypnos could be well suited. This was the Greek God of Sleep.</p><h2>Marmite</h2><p>This is a famous British savory spread that has developed into a term that is used to describe something that is very strongly divisive. If something is like Marmite, then you either 'love it or hate it'. If you have a cat with a very distinct personality, that not everyone takes to, then Marmite could be the perfect cute, unique name for them.</p><h2>Meelap</h2><p>If your cat is constantly misbehaving and embarrassing you in front of guests, then maybe you could name them Meelap. This has its origins in Sanskrit and means embarrassment. This name could work for a female cat too.</p><h2>Nermal</h2><p>Nermal is the adorable looking nemesis of the comic strip character Garfield. He names himself as the cutest kitten in the world. If you have a cute looking cat with a superiority complex, what better name to go for than this.</p><h2>Nimbus</h2><p>If you have a moody cat or just one with dark grey coloring, then naming them after this dark type of raincloud could work.</p><h2>Pan</h2><p>If you have read the Philip Pullman Dark Materials Trilogy, you will know that the main character Lyra has a soul companion that is commonly in the form of a wildcat and he is called Pantalaimon, or Pan for short. This would be the perfect name for fans of the novel, or for a very sensible cat who is the antithesis of reckless.</p><h2>Shiro</h2><p>If you have a white cat and you are looking for a more unique name than the common Snowy or Marshmallow, then what about Shiro? This is a Japanese word that means white.</p><h2>Sulley</h2><p>Who can forget this lovable fluffy blue character from the Pixar movie Monsters Inc? The little girl Boo endearingly refers to him as 'Kitty' throughout the first movie. So if you have a fluffy, gentle giant of a cat then this name would be a great match.</p><h2>Woozle</h2><p>Tigger is a popular cat name. Who doesn't love the famous character from Winnie the Pooh? It isn't exactly a unique name though. If you love these books and you have a cat that is timid and shy, then why not name them, in an ironic fashion, after these villainous honey stealing characters instead.</p>",779
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/help-older-cat-accept-kitten-554827,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>How to Introduce a Kitten to an Older Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Introduce a Kitten to an Older Cat</h1><p>Some planning must go into the process of introducing a kitten to an older cat. Friendly, single adult cats can have trouble adjusting to living with a new kitten. Often times the older cats will appear sad, reclusive, hiss a lot, and sometimes even stop eating or start urinating in strange places if it isn't adjusting well to the new member of the family.</p><p>These behaviors occur because cats do not like change, especially when it involves their established territory. Introducing a kitten to an adult cat can cause a lot of stress in your household, but there are some things you can do to help make the introduction go more smoothly.</p><h2>Calm Your Older Cat</h2><p>Pheromones are useful for creating a calm environment for any cat. The weeks before the arrival of a new kitten is a great time to make use of them. Diffusers, sprays, and wipes are all available and help your cat feel relaxed without the use of drugs. Try using pheromones for at least a few weeks before bringing home a kitten.</p><p>If you suspect your older cat will become stressed and anxious with a new kitten, consider nutritional supplements that are designed to calm a cat. These won't drug your pet but will help it remain calm and relaxed. They typically work best if given a few weeks prior to the anticipated stressful event and can be continued after the new kitten arrives. The ingredients usually include L-theanine, Phellodendron, magnolia, whey or milk proteins, and other natural ingredients shown to be safe and effective for pets.</p><h2>Get Your Home Ready</h2><p>New items for your kitten, such as food bowls, beds, another litter box, and toys, should be placed in and around your home before the kitten comes home. Start putting these items in their new places about a week before the new arrival so your adult cat can smell them and get used to all the new things. If you can, try to include items that have the scent of the kitten on them already. Make sure you are ready for the kitten. If you are stressed out and unprepared, your older cat will be able to tell and be negatively affected by it.</p><p>Designate a small room, such as a bathroom, for your new kitten to retreat to and spend the first week or so in. Your older cat should be able to get to the door of this room in order to hear and smell them, but not have any interaction with the kitten. Place the kitten's belongings in this room (such as a litter box and food bowls) along with a toy that belongs to your older cat.</p><p>Cats are typically stressed by limited access to resources. Resources include food, water, litter boxes, prime perching spots, and There should be a litter box for each cat PLUS an additional litter box, and these boxes should be distributed throughout the house. Cats typically do not want to cross paths with another cat when attempting to access a resource, so keep this in mind when placing resources throughout the house. Remember it is a good idea to start using pheromones and calming supplements PRIOR to making any changes in your house as this process alone has been known to cause stress-related illnesses in cats.</p><h2>Prepare Your Cat</h2><p>Make sure your older cat is healthy. Added stress to an unhealthy cat will only make things worse and you want your cat not only mentally prepared for a new kitten but also physically ready to handle it. Take your cat in for a checkup with your vet to make sure it is healthy and that its vaccinations are current. Respiratory diseases are common in kittens and you'll want your older cat's immune system to be ready to tackle anything that comes into the house. In case scratching or biting occurs between the cat and kitten, you'll also want the rabies vaccine up to date to avoid any problems.</p><p>While older cats will occasionally take to a new kitten right away, they typically need a little time to adjust to the changes. Sometimes cats never fully accept a new kitten but will simply coexist, keeping to themselves away from the other cat in the house. You'll want to make sure that no matter how your cat feels about the new kitten, that things stay peaceful and you have the best chance at creating a budding friendship from the start.</p><h2>Introduce Your Cat to the New Kitten</h2><p>When you bring your kitten home, allow your cat to sniff it while the kitten is in a carrier. Go directly to the room previously designated and set up for your new kitten and allow the kitten to explore. The litter box, food bowls, bed, and some toys should all be easily accessible. Do not let your older cat have immediate access to the kitten.</p><p>At night, when you are not home, and whenever you are unable to supervise the kitten and your older cat, keep the kitten in its designated room with the door closed. As your cat gets curious, it may stick its paw under the door, sniff under the door, and listen to the kitten. Do this for about a week, depending on how your cat is acting with the changes. Don't forget to provide a lot of attention to your older cat after playing with your kitten. Just wash your hands between play sessions to avoid spread of infections at first. It'll need your attention and support and the scent of the kitten on your clothing will help it get used to the newcomer.</p><h2>Encourage Time Together</h2><p>After about a week, let your kitten explore the house under your watchful eye. Allow your older cat to observe this exploration and retreat if it wants to. Do not force interaction between your cat and kitten. If your cat has a favorite interactive toy, such as a feather wand or laser pointer, try playing with both cats at the same time. This will encourage mutual activity. You can also give them both treats at the same time and feed them at the same time from separate bowls. Be sure to leave enough space between the food bowls so your older cat does not feel threatened.</p><h2>Allow Your Cat to Establish Boundaries</h2><p>Cats need to have order and a new member in the home must learn the rules. Your older cat may have a period of time when it tries to establish boundaries with the new kitten. Your older cat may hiss and swat at the kitten when the newcomer does something unfavorable. This is completely normal and as long as it is just hissing and swatting, do your best to not interfere. Your older cat is teaching the kitten where its boundaries as the new cat are.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>They may never turn out to be best friends, but most cats learn to accept and occasionally appreciate the presence of another feline roommate. Don't give up if the first encounters are not positive. Older cats can take time to acclimate to a younger cat. A common mistake is to rush the socialization between cats and then get mad or frustrated when it doesn't work out. Keep calm and work in increments to bring the cats together. Try timing your interactions and slowly increasing the amount of time together. If your older cat is especially aggressive toward the new kitten, speak with your vet or a behavior specialist for tips.</p>",1241
69,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-to-socialize-kittens-553890,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>How to Socialize Your Kitten</h1>,"<h1>How to Socialize Your Kitten</h1><p>All kittens require early socialization in order to become good pets. It helps kittens learn to interact with other cats and pets as well as people, and it requires positive interactions. Socialization also helps build confidence in young cats and makes them feel secure in their home environments. Taking the time to properly socialize your kitten now is like giving it emotional health insurance that will stay with your cat for all of its nine lives.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p>Cats can be trained at any age and they continue to learn throughout their lives. Kittens are furry sponges that absorb lessons-both good and bad-at an incredible pace. The prime kitten socialization period is a narrow window during babyhood when learning the ""wrong"" lessons can emotionally cripple the cat. For example, kittens not exposed to positive experiences with humans during this period will be wild (feral) critters and never accept people.</p><p>Proper socialization teaches a cat how to be a cat, proper feline manners, how to communicate with other felines, and who the cat's friends and enemies are. The age when kittens are most receptive is between two and seven weeks of age.</p><p>Since kittens start learning so early, most of the ""life as a cat"" lessons should have been done by the time you adopted the kitten. There's a reason people use the term : Kittens learn by watching their mother and patterning behaviors after her. If a cat mother is buddies with a dog, her kittens will accept dogs as a safe part of their world. But if the mother cat goes into hysterics, that's a lesson the kittens will have a hard time un-learning.</p><p>The littermates teach each other about claw and bite inhibition, and how to pull their punches during play. Interactions with each other and with adult cats give kittens practice with the kitty language of meows, fluffed fur, and tail or body positions.</p><p>Singleton kittens-the only kitten in a litter or one who is separated early-can have a difficult time learning to get along with other cats because they simply don't speak the same language. For that reason, it's ideal for kittens to stay with their mother and littermates as long as possible; 10 to 12 weeks is optimal. And people raising or fostering litters must begin positive lessons before the babies go to new homes.</p><p>Of course, shelters don't often have the luxury of keeping kittens that long, so kittens may be adopted as early as 6 or 8 weeks. While humans can't duplicate Mom-cat lessons, you can offer some guidance.</p><p>Youngsters have an increased capacity for learning, so it's helpful for new owners to continue these lessons for several weeks after adopting a kitten. It's vital that the babies be exposed to positive experiences with other pets and people if they are to accept them as part of their ""family"" and become loving well-adjusted pets. Kittens can be socialized based on the three T's: touching, talking, and timing.</p><h2>What You Need</h2><h2>Touching</h2><p>Touching your kitten often is a vital part of socializing your new arrival. Petting is one of the first sensations newborns feel when their mother licks and grooms them, and petting harkens back to this wonderful safe experience.</p><p>Petting feels good for both of you and it teaches your kitten that contact with people is pleasant, self-rewarding, and in no way scary. This is particularly important given your kitten's recent move to a new home that is filled with unfamiliar sights, sounds, objects, and family members.</p><p>Cats are all about scent marking and petting places your scent on the kitten. This helps your kitten associate your smell with feelings of well-being. It also acts like a possessive marker saying that the two of you belong to each other which can really strengthen your bond right from the start.</p><p>There are physiological benefits as well. Pleasant touch prompts a reduction in blood pressure and heart rate and can change brain wave activity. This can set your kitten up for a lifetime of calm interaction and good health.</p><p>Studies have shown that handling furry babies for five minutes a day during their first three weeks increases the pet's ability to learn later in life. No matter its age, when you bring your kitten home, that five minutes should be an absolute minimum for daily petting. Try to pet your kitten as often as possible, even if it's just in passing as you walk around the house. Take the time to sit down with your kitten for a few brief petting sessions each day and give it your undivided attention as well.</p><h2>Talking</h2><p>Talking to your kitten teaches the youngster to listen and pay attention to your voice. It may not understand all the words but it will recognize if you're happy, aggravated, amused, or affectionate. The more you speak to your cat, the better it will learn to understand and react to what you want. That enhances your relationship and sets a good foundation for training now and in the future.</p><p>Talk to your cat as often as you can. During your petting sessions, use a soft, soothing voice so the kitten associates this time and you with affection and security. At other times, make sure your tone reflects the mood of the moment. For instance, during playtime, your voice should be bright and cheery and when you need to correct the kitten, use a firm and stern tone.</p><h2>Timing</h2><p>Timing helps the kitten learn how to live in your home. Kittens won't know what's right and wrong unless you tell them at the right time If your kitten leaves an aromatic bathroom deposit on the carpet, for example, and you find it 20 minutes later, it won't have a clue why you're angry. Only when you catch the kitten in the act will the youngster be able to connect your displeasure with the incident.</p><p>It's actually more powerful to use timing to catch your kitten doing something . Praise the kitten when it uses the litter box correctly. Offer a treat when it greets visitors with happy purrs. Celebrate with a favorite chase-the-feather or other game when the kitten plays nicely with other pets or people.</p><h2>Preventing Problems During Socialization</h2><p>It's important that you fill your kitten's first weeks in its new home with positive experiences. This is a critical time that will help shape your cat's personality and behavior for its entire life. For this reason, it's best to avoid as many negative interactions as possible. Try not to raise your voice or yell when you're angry with your kitten. This can frighten the kitten and develop a life-long fear or anxiety that may hinder your attempts at socialization.</p><p>Be sure to involve your entire family in the socialization process. Introduce the kitten slowly to other pets as well so it learns how to interact with them. Even kittens who are currently the only furry family member will be better off being exposed to dogs or other cats. This is particularly true if there's a possibility you'll be adopting another pet in the future.</p><p>If you adopted a singleton kitten, you will need to work even harder at socialization. You will want to simultaneously take on the role of mother, playmate, and teacher of the lessons it should have learned from other cats (to best of your ability, of course). Some people find that it's actually easiest to adopt two kittens that are nearly the same age when one is a singleton. This can really help the two learn from each other.</p>",1240
70,https://www.thesprucepets.com/preparing-for-new-kitten-552273,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>How to Prepare for a New Kitten</h1>,"<h1>How to Prepare for a New Kitten</h1><h2>Kitten-Proof and Kitten-Prep Your Home</h2><p>Kittens are adorable and playful, but they're also unique individuals that have personalities, needs, and behaviors of their own. Before welcoming a new kitten (or kittens) to your home, you'll need to prepare your home for a curious critter with the ability to climb, leap, and scratch. You'll also need to provide your kitten with appropriate toys, bedding, litter boxes, and food.</p><p>If you're adopting a kitten that is 6 weeks old or older, it may have recently been weaned from its mother. Some kittens are orphaned, meaning they were separated from their mothers prematurely for some reason, which often happens with stray cats. These orphaned kittens are bottle-fed and cared for by animal shelters until they are old enough for adoption. In either case, kittens need to continue to be socialized and exposed to lots of different experiences to help them adjust well. This includes providing them with safe spaces to explore and keeping them away from unfamiliar dangers.</p><p>As a new kitten owner, your responsibility includes checking your home for potential dangers and providing appropriate and safe options for your pet. You'll also need to establish guidelines for kitten behavior and stick to them.</p><h2>Kitten-Proof Your Home</h2><p>Your first priority will be to remove serious hazards from your kitten's reach. Among the toughest to manage are electrical wires and outlets, many of which are at ground level. Kittens and cats are attracted to loose wires, so consider taping wires to baseboards or the underside of tables or desks. Other hazards include kitten-sized openings in floorboards and rocking chairs or gliders that can crush an unwary kitten. Make sure all windows have screens and repair any screens that have holes. Also find a secure place to put away any strings or threads such as knitting and sewing materials that can be very hazardous if ingested.</p><p>During the initial adjustment period (at least seven to 10 days), it is a good idea to confine the kitten to a small room of the house. This room must be completely kitten-proofed as it should be the only room you leave your kitten in unsupervised at first. This allows your kitten to have a safe space to explore while you gradually introduce it to the rest of your home. This is especially important if you have other pets at home as they should be separated during this period to allow gradual, well-supervised interactions.</p><h2>The Basic Necessities</h2><p>At the very least, your kitten will need these basic necessities: food, a place to sleep, a scratching post or pad, and a litter box and litter. Of course, you won't be able to pass up a few toys. They will make the coming home experience a little easier on your new addition, especially since he'll be isolated from any other cats for the first few days. Create a shopping list for everything you'll need.</p><h2>Cat Bedding Options</h2><p>Your new kitten may be perfectly comfortable in a cardboard box lined with clean, soft towels or a small blanket, but you may consider giving him a real bed too, just like the big guys. The best bets are beds that are either fully washable or have a washable and/or replaceable cover. Don't spend a lot of money, though: there's an excellent chance that your kitten will pass up the bed you've prepared for the end of your bed, a spot on the couch, or any sunny corner of your home. Cats often like a place to hide, especially if they are nervous at first in a new place, so a bed with a cover, or a box of some kind is a good idea to help them feel secure while they are adjusting to their new digs.</p><h2>Kitten Food for Kittens</h2><p>The first year of a cat's life sets the pace for his future development, health, and well-being. It is essential that he eats a quality food developed for kittens.</p><p>At first, give him the same brand of food he's been eating at the breeders, foster home, or shelter, to avoid tummy upsets from sudden diet changes. If you intend to change the diet later, start by gradually mixing small amounts of the new food in with the current diet, increasing the amount of the new food each day over seven to 10 days. Use a small, low bowl so she can reach inside (many cat bowls are intended for larger adults). It's very important, too, to provide your kitten with plenty of clean, fresh water. Change the water each day, and consider investing in a low-cost ""cat fountain"" which recirculates water and is often more attractive to kittens than a simple bowl.</p><h2>Interactive Toys</h2><p>You're going to spend a lot of time in the first weeks bonding with your new kitten, establishing a close relationship that will last a lifetime. One of the best ways to start this bond is by playing with a kitten with an interactive toy. You can purchase everything from low-cost to very expensive items at the pet store, but don't forget another favorite game is ""fetch"" with a wadded-up piece of paper. Other fun simple toys include toilet paper rolls, paper bags, and the light from a flashlight or laser pointer that can be fun to chase. Always be careful as feathers, string, and other small parts can become choking hazards if they detach from toys so it is always important to supervise play closely.</p><h2>Scratching Posts</h2><p>It is not considered a humane practice to declaw cats so it is important to keep your kitty's nails in good health. This includes providing good scratching surfaces for them to shed the outer husks of their nails, and keeping up with regular nail trims. Some kittens will try to claw at your carpet or walls; to avoid damage to your home, you'll want to provide your kitten with a scratching post. A favorite ""starting scratcher"" among feline aficionados is the Cosmic Alpine Scratcher, an inexpensive, long-lasting cardboard incline with a corrugated cardboard scratching surface. Some cats prefer to scratch on horizontal surfaces, while others prefer vertical surfaces, so you may have to try a few options to find your cat's preference.</p><h2>Litter Box and Litter</h2><p>There are many litter boxes on the market, but make sure the one you choose is shallow enough for easy entrance and egress for your little guy. Many people use a small plastic storage box of appropriate size, for starters. If you are adopting a rescue kitten, ask the foster parents or shelter for advice about the best litter to use since it may be helpful to continue using what the kitty is familiar with. Bear in mind that some kittens will take time to adjust to their litter box, so you may also want to buy some pads to place around the box in case of accidents.</p><h2>Preparing Yourself for Your New Pet</h2><p>If you've never owned a kitten, you'll need to prepare yourself a bit for pet ownership. Unlike some other pets (fish and mice, for example), kittens need attention, companionship, and care. But that doesn't mean you need to turn your home over to your pet. In fact, just like human beings, kittens and cats thrive in settings where rules and expectations are clear.</p>",1198
71,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-development-first-six-weeks-555170,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>Kitten Development in the First Six Weeks of Life</h1>,"<h1>Kitten Development in the First Six Weeks of Life</h1><p>The first six weeks in a kitten's life is crucial for its development. They will grow and develop quickly, however they are susceptible to a number of threats. Now outside the womb, a kitten will need warmth, food, and protection from infectious diseases and parasites (such as fleas).</p><p>Kittens will probably never grow again at the remarkable rate they accomplish during this period, and seeing the changes in their development from week to week is an incredible experience. Learn about their first week and move on from there.</p><h2>Week 1: Tiny Food Processing Factories</h2><p>The newborn kitten weighs just ounces and easily fits into the palm of your hand. Its umbilical cord will fall off within two or three days, but its eyes and ear canals will not be open yet.</p><p>Kittens are very helpless at this age, but the mother cat instinctively knows their needs. She feeds them, keeps them close by for warmth, and bathes them with her rough tongue, which also stimulates their digestion and helps them urinate and defecate. Mother cats are very protective of their little ones and will move them to another location if humans intrude too much into the nest.</p><p>Provided the mother has been vaccinated or has natural immunity, the kittens will receive this same immunity for the first 24 to 48 hours through her colostrum, and it will last until they are old enough to get their kitten shots.</p><p>Newborns will weigh an average of 3.5 ounces at birth and may double their weight by the end of the first week. It's a good idea to weigh them and monitor their weight to ascertain if they are getting adequate nutrition. They are simply little food processing factories at this point, and their only activities are nursing, sleeping, and passing waste. There is very little social interaction at this age, other than competing for their favorite nipple, where they will suckle while kneading with their tiny paws.</p><p>The rule of thumb in regards to the amount to feed young kittens is eight cc of formula per ounce of body weight per day. You will gradually increase the amount of formula for each feeding and decrease the number of feedings. A cubic centimeter (cc) is the same as a milliliter (ml). An ounce equals 30 cc or ml.</p><h2>Week 2: Growing and Developing</h2><p>Your kitten is continuing its growth at an astonishing rate, by at least 10 grams per day. The mother cat should be fed a quality canned kitten food to help replenish the nutrients she loses through nursing. Later on, the kittens will be introduced to the same food.</p><p>Its eyes will start to open and will be completely open at nine to 14 days old. All kittens' eyes are blue and will remain so for several weeks. Their vision will be blurred at first, and their pupils don't dilate and contract readily, so they should be kept from bright lights.</p><h2>Week 3: Awareness is Developing</h2><p>Ear canals will be completely open, and their sense of hearing is still developing. However, the kittens may startle at loud sounds. Their ears may be fully erect by this age.</p><p>Their eye color may start to change, from the blue shared by all kittens to the adult hue. Their sense of smell will be well developed. Kittens can voluntarily eliminate now, as their digestive system is developing. The mother cat will continue to clean them until they learn grooming skills.</p><h2>Week 4: Standing and Wobbling</h2><p>Kittens will start to stand sometime between the third and fourth weeks and will try to walk, although their first movements will be very wobbly. Their bodies are out of proportion to their eventual adult state. Little tails are very short and ""stick-like,"" and their heads are disproportionately large for their bodies and legs. This will all change, though, as they get their ""sea legs"" and start moving around.</p><p>Don't be surprised to see kittens escaping from their nesting area as they seek to expand their horizons. They will also interact more with their litter mates, even to the point of forming ""alliances,"" which may or may not be gender-based.</p><p>Kittens will continue to nurse regularly. It is important to continue feeding the mother good quality food, as long as she is nursing kittens.</p><h2>Week 5: Starting the Weaning Process</h2><p>Kittens will be walking around freely at this time and starting to play with their siblings. They will be developing a new sense of independence, although they may not stray far from their mother or their littermates. This will be a very good time for them to socialize with humans.</p><p>Kittens may be introduced to canned food at this time. Select a quality brand of kitten food with a named meat source as the first ingredient (chicken is good). Ideally, they should be given the same kitten food given the mother cat, as the kittens will quickly accommodate and eat mom's food. Use a shallow plate and expect their first experiences to be messy.</p><p>Although the mother cat will try to wean the kittens, they still need the nursing experience to satisfy their suckling needs-at least until they are eight or 10 weeks old, by which time the mother cat will have gradually weaned them.</p><p>Kittens can also learn litter box basics now. They need a smaller, separate box, one that will be easy to access and exit, with only an inch or two of litter. A shallow plastic storage box or lid to a shoebox might work for starters. As human babies experiment by tasting everything, so will kittens. Avoid their ingestion of harmful substances by using a natural litter such as one made from corn cobs, paper, or wood chips-never use clumping clay.</p><h2>Week 6: Socialization in Full Swing</h2><p>Socialization skills continue, and there is no doubt that these are lively, active, kittens who will grow up all too soon to be adult cats. They can run, pounce, and leap, and can entertain themselves and their human observers endlessly. Just as quickly they can fall asleep at the drop of a hat (growing up is hard work), so take care not to let them tire.</p><p>Kittens will follow their mother cat's lead in socializing with humans. If she has a comfortable relationship with the humans in her life, so will her kittens. However, if kittens are not accustomed to human handling by six weeks, it may be a long, slow, process to train them later, and such a cat may never be a ""lap cat.""</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Kittens should learn at this age that hands are not for playing-hands are for holding, petting, and feeding. One of the best ""toys"" for teaching this lesson is a plastic drinking straw. You can drag it across the floor and watch the kitten chase it, then wiggle it a bit, and allow it to pounce on it and ""capture"" it. The baby may proudly strut with its prize before settling down to bite on it. Make sure to supervise your kitten while with the straw, as you don't want them ingesting plastic.</p><h2>Almost Time to Go Home</h2><p>Well-socialized and completely weaned kittens may be ready for their new forever homes in just a couple of weeks from now.

72,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-development-from-3-to-6-months-4584604,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>Kitten Development From 3 to 6 Months</h1>,"<h1>Kitten Development From 3 to 6 Months</h1><p>A kitten is born, its eyes and ears open, it gets teeth, and then weans from nursing to eating solid kitten food. There are a lot of changes that happen in just the first couple of months of a kitten's life. But the next few months are also full of changes and new experiences for a growing kitten.</p><h2>Physical Development</h2><p>At three months of age, a kitten will have developed all of its baby teeth and they will even begin falling out. If the teeth do not fall out by the time the kitten is about six months of age, a veterinarian may recommend they be extracted when the kitten gets spayed or neutered. Baby teeth that don't fall out are called retained deciduous teeth and they can cause problems for the adult teeth if they don't fall out or get extracted in time. A typical cat will have 26 baby teeth and 30 adult teeth so there is a lot of teething going on for a few months. You may find baby teeth lying around the house but most of the time the kitten swallows the teeth.</p><p>By three months of age, a kitten's eyes will also be their adult color. The baby blue eyes will have changed to a permanent adult eye color unless the cat has the genes to permanently have blue eyes.</p><p>Between three and six months of age, a kitten's body shape will start to fill out. This means a kitten will start to get more muscular and evolve from a round-bellied baby to a lean and slender young adult.</p><h2>Behavior Changes</h2><p>Kittens sleep a lot when they are first born, but as they grow they will spend a little less time sleeping and more time playing and exploring. From the ages of three to six months, a kitten is just brave enough to test its physical limits, put different items in its mouth, and approach other animals to see what happens. The first few months of socialization with its littermates and mother will pay off during these next three months as you will start to see a kitten's personality develop. If it did not receive appropriate socialization, it may begin to develop aggression issues with toys or food.</p><p>Teething is normal behavior for kittens of this age. Chewing on furniture, toys, and even some items a kitten shouldn't chew on is an attempt to help the baby teeth fall out as the adult teeth are coming in. This behavior should be allowed but restricted to safe toys. Kitten-proofing a home is often necessary to keep a kitten safe from items like electrical cords, but also to keep your belongings safe from tiny, yet damaging, kitten teeth and nails.</p><p>Most kittens are sexually mature by the time they are about six months of age, but this can vary from cat to cat with some breeds developing more slowly or more quickly. Once a cat reaches sexual maturity, it may start to act differently due to the hormones that are now circulating within its body. Female kittens may go into a heat cycle and demonstrate behaviors such as crying and holding their tail up in the air while male kittens may become more aggressive. Surgery to spay or neuter a kitten will eliminate the behaviors caused by the hormones circulating throughout its body.</p><h2>Health and Care</h2><p>A kitten should have already had its first vet visit and received its first FVRCP vaccination at about two months of age, but that isn't all a growing kitten will need. Three to four weeks after the first vaccination, or at about three months of age, the second FVRCP vaccination is administered. About one month later, the last FVRCP vaccination is administered along with a rabies vaccination. During these three months, your veterinarian may also discuss other vaccination options with you depending on your kitten's lifestyle and exposure risks. The first year the vaccinations are received is the only year they will need to receive boosters to be effective. These vaccinations are incredibly important to help keep your kitten healthy, and the rabies vaccination is even required by law, even for indoor-only cats.</p><p>Spaying and neutering are very common surgical procedures, and by six months of age, most kittens are having one of these procedures done. Females get spayed and males get neutered, but both surgeries are removing the reproductive organs in a kitten. With these organs removed, less sexual hormones are being produced, a cat is unable to reproduce, and the risk of many types of cancer are eliminated or greatly lowered. Your veterinarian will recommend the best time to spay or neuter your kitten and may also recommend pre-operative blood screening be performed before the surgery. This blood screening will not only show whether or not your kitten is healthy enough for anesthesia, but it will also establish baseline normal values for your kitten. These baseline values will be useful to compare future blood work to as your cat ages.</p><p>Parasite prevention is important to start on kittens as soon as they are old enough or weigh enough to receive it. Talk to your veterinarian about parasite prevention options for intestinal parasites, fleas, ticks, and heartworms at the first vet visit. These medications are often given to a kitten monthly, but some are needed less frequently.</p><h2>Food and Nutrition</h2><p>Kittens between the ages of three and six months should be eating an AAFCO-approved, formulated kitten food to receive all of their nutritional requirements. They will continue to eat this food until they are about nine to twelve months old. As a kitten approaches six months of age, you may have to regulate how much you feed it if it is gaining too much weight. Every kitten food has a different amount of calories per cup of food, so you will need to follow the feeding guidelines on the bag or can or work with your veterinarian to determine how much food your specific kitten needs. The average kitten usually needs about 1/2 cup of an average dry kitten food a day.</p><h2>Training</h2><p>The period between three and six months of age is important for training a kitten on where it can and cannot go in the house, what items are acceptable to play with and even teaching it its name. Treats, verbal praise, and petting should be used to reinforce good behaviors.</p><p>Litter box training should come naturally to a kitten but there are special litters designed to attract kittens if you are concerned about it not knowing where to potty. Make sure your kitten can get in and out of the litter box and knows where to find all of the boxes in the house. If you have one kitten you should have at least two litter boxes in separate locations, ideally on each floor of a multi-level home</p>",1168
73,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bringing-home-a-kitten-552266,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>The First 30 Days With Your New Kitten</h1>,"<h1>The First 30 Days With Your New Kitten</h1><p>Getting a new kitten is an exciting time. You may have been anticipating getting a kitten for some time or you might have not even known a kitten was about to join your household. But regardless of the circumstances of the arrival, the first month with your new kitten is a month of changes, and there are things you can do to make these changes go smoothly.</p><h2>Before Bringing Your Kitten Home</h2><p>If you are planning to bring a new kitten into your home, then you should take some time to prepare for the kitten 's arrival. Purchase the items that your kitten will need and place them in your home for other people and pets to start adjusting to. Synthetic calming pheromones can be purchased as a diffuser or spray and used prior to the arrival of the new kitten to help older cats and the new kitten feel calm and relaxed. Even if you already have a cat, make sure the new kitten will have its own bed, food and water dishes, litter box, and toys. Set up a bathroom or other small room with these items for your kitten to stay in temporarily to provide a contained safe space while your kitten adjusts away from other pets and possible dangers in the rest of the home.</p><p>You should have at least one more litter box than you have cats and there should be no direct line of sight from litter box to litter box to prevent the cats from stalking or intimidating each other while using them. Extra litter and, of course, kitten food will also be needed to help your kitten feel at home.</p><h2>First Day</h2><p>Day one with your new kitten is very exciting, but you 'll want to be careful that you don 't overwhelm it. Let the kitten explore in the small room you have already set up, or if you didn 't have time to prepare for its arrival, set up a safe room and sit on the floor while the kitten acclimates to it.</p><p>If you have other pets, allow them to sniff the kitten from a distance but be sure to keep the kitten safe at all times. Place the kitten in the small room with its belongings when you can 't supervise it, so you won 't have to worry about anyone getting hurt.</p><p>Make sure the kitten knows where the litter boxes are and where they eat and drink and ensure they have access to all of these basic needs within their small safe room. If the kitten wants to sleep, let it sleep. Keep the carrier you brought it home in accessible to it, in case the kitten is nervous and wants to curl up inside of it or provide another safe hiding space such as a box. It is common for a new kitten to hide at first, sometimes for the first few days, as it adjusts to all the changes. As long as it has all the essentials and quiet alone time, it will venture out of its hiding spot little by little each day. Don't try to force it out as this can cause unnecessary stress and negative associations with people or parts of your home.</p><h2>10 Days</h2><p>After a few days, your kitten will begin to explore its new home. You can encourage your kitten to venture out of its separate room little by little each day by using toys and treats to make it a game. Your kitten will get used to where the other litter boxes, food, and water dishes are as well. It might even claim a favorite spot to sleep and befriend your pets.</p><p>Make sure your kitten continues to eat and drink well and to monitor their litter box habits during this time. If you see anything abnormal including loose stools in the litter box, it is a good idea to bring this sample to the vet. You'll need to make an appointment during this time to get your kitten checked out even if it appears healthy, since it may need vaccines, deworming, and/or a routine check up.</p><p>If your cat is going to wear a collar, choose a collar that fits and add some identification, like a name tag with your phone number, in case your kitten gets outside. It is best to purchase cat-specific break-away collars which are designed to fall off if they get caught on something. This can prevent injuries, especially in active kittens, if they get a paw or tooth caught on the collar, or if they get caught on something while exploring. Microchipping can be discussed with your vet as a more permanent form of identification.</p><h2>30 Days</h2><p>By the end of the first month, your kitten should be eating, drinking, and using the litter box normally. Your cat should be adjusted to its new home by now and becoming active and playful. You may notice new behaviors, such as scratching on vertical surfaces, wrestling, climbing, chewing, and jumping on furniture. If there is a behavior that is less than favorable to you that your kitten is starting to exhibit, be sure to nip it in the bud as soon as possible. Provide your kitten with appropriate scratching surfaces, items to climb, and toys to play with. Use treats and catnip to entice it to the areas you want it to play in and on and redirect it to these items when it goes for something off-limits.</p><p>The kitten should have also been to the vet at least once for vaccines, a fecal check, and a physical examination, but refrain from taking your kitten anywhere other than a vet 's office until they are fully vaccinated. Stay on schedule with the recommended initial vaccines and while there, ask your vet about monthly preventatives for fleas, heartworms, intestinal parasites, etc.</p><p>Don't panic if you have another cat and it isn't getting along with the new kitten just yet. This process can take time and 30 days may not be enough for your cat to adjust. This is where those synthetic calming pheromones can help all the cats in the household to adjust; they can be used as a diffuser in a room both cats spend time in, or a spray that can be used on their beds or other common areas. It can also help them bond if you make their interactions more positive by playing with both cats together, giving them treats, and/or engaging in other activities your cats enjoy, such as grooming, with the new kitten in tow. If either cat becomes overwhelmed, scared, or aggressive during these sessions, it is a good idea to separate them temporarily. A gradual introduction is always the best approach, and that may take more or less time for different cats with different personalities. Time and patience will be worth the effort when your cats do bond and you can enjoy watching them play together, cuddle, and even groom one another.</p>",1158
74,https://www.thesprucepets.com/raising-newborn-kittens-552269,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>Raising Newborn Kittens</h1>,"<h1>Raising Newborn Kittens</h1><h2>Your Role as a Surrogate Mother</h2><p>Raising newborn kittens is both challenging and time-consuming; it can be intensely rewarding and heartbreaking, as well. If you don't have the time or the emotional stamina to deal with the potential of losing kittens, you might leave the job to trained professionals. However, if your bleeding heart is ready to take on the challenge of stray babies, then go for it. Just make sure you can find a home for them all.</p><h2>Birth Mother or Surrogate?</h2><p>If the kittens are strays, yet being cared for by the mother cat, she will do the work of raising them and in most cases, will do a better job than humans who attempt to step in and bottle-feed. Bottle-feeding should be a last resort for kittens who are not otherwise nursing. It is a good idea to schedule a veterinary checkup to make sure everyone's healthy if the mama cat is docile enough to allow it. Some stray cats are not comfortable with human handling, and this can be especially stressful for new mothers. It is best to let the mama cat have space to feel safe to care for her new babies. Provide the mother cat with access to unlimited fresh water and food and give her a safe, quiet space where she can be alone with her kittens. Monitor the kittens to ensure they are all nursing, gaining weight, and staying warm. The rest is up to her.</p><p>If you encounter newborn kittens without a mother, or a mother who cannot nurse, you may need to act as the mother and provide the kittens' basic needs to ensure their survival. This requires round-the-clock care, at first, as if you just brought home a newborn baby.</p><h2>First Trip to the Vet</h2><p>Your veterinarian should examine orphaned newborns as soon as possible. Stray kittens can suffer from fleas and other parasites and may not have received the benefits of protective antibodies passed through their mother's milk. Orphaned kittens may need certain immunizations earlier than kittens who nurse until they are naturally weaned. And, any kitten showing signs of illness or distress including low body temperature, watery eyes, runny nose, diarrhea, lethargy, or failure to eat-should be seen immediately by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Building a Nest</h2><p>Next up on your surrogate to-do list is building a nesting box for your kittens. You can use an oversized cat bed with bumper sides or even just a cardboard box lined with clean towels. Either way, make sure your nest has tall enough sides so that the small babies won't tumble out. This also encourages the litter to stay together to generate warmth.</p><p>Since kittens that get cold can decline in health very quickly, make sure that the nest is located in a warm space in your home. For the first few weeks, you may have to provide supplemental heat in the form of a heating pad set on low. Wrap this pad in a thick towel and place it in the bottom of the nest. Make sure the nursery has an unheated section, as well. Instinctively, the kittens will move toward the cooler area if they become too hot.</p><h2>Feeding Newborn Kittens</h2><p>For the first few weeks, you will need to bottle feed the entire litter several times a day. Purchase formula made specifically for kittens, as well as kitten bottles and nipples. Follow the directions on the kitten formula for feeding by weight. Younger and smaller babies will need as many as twelve feedings around the clock (every two hours), so set your alarm for night feedings and recruit a family member to help. Bottle feedings can be performed in a comfortable chair with a kitten on your lap, wrapped in a warm towel. Situate him on his belly, and then present the nipple to encourage him to suck. Feed each kitten until they are no longer interested and have had enough.</p><p>At around three or four weeks old, the babies are ready to start eating soft food from a dish. Place canned kitten food and formula into your blender and process it until it's the consistency of a thick liquid. Prime each kitten by putting a bit of the mixture onto your fingertip, and then lead them to the dish. As the kittens start to enjoy their mush, gradually reduce the amount of formula in the mixture until they are eating soft, canned food as is. At this point, your kittens can also drink water from a bowl. But don't be surprised if there is a little water play before they decide to drink it.</p><p>Eventually, your kittens will graduate to all solid foods and this can include a combination of canned and dry kitten food. Since their tummies are small, offer them four or five small meals a day until they reach 8 weeks old.</p><h2>Nurturing Newborn Kittens</h2><p>The mother kitten performs various tasks that both ensure the health of her kittens, as well as promote bonding. If you're the head honcho, these tasks fall on you.</p><p>Mother cats encourage newborns to urinate and move their bowels by washing their bums with her tongue. You can encourage the same elimination pattern by holding each kitty (put a towel over your lap first) and gently stroking its hind end with a warm wet washcloth or moistened cotton ball. You should be rewarded with urine and/or a bowel movement after every meal.</p><p>Grooming and massaging your newborn kittens replicates the bonding activities the mother cat usually performs. A soft baby brush, towel, or soft bristled toothbrush can be used to stroke your kittens down their backs, on their tummies, and to clean any dirt from their bodies. Soft-touch and massage help kittens adapt more easily to your presence and their new home.</p><h2>Litterbox Training</h2><p>Kittens take to the litterbox as quickly as ducks to water. Use a low-sided box for training-the lid to a shoebox works perfectly. A non-clumping, pellet litter works best for untrained newbies, as the clumping-type causes digestive upset if they eat it. Once the kittens start eating on their own, place each one in the box within 5-10 minutes after eating. Scratch the litter with your finger to show them what it's all about. When they hop out, put them back in a few times, then leave them alone. If one has an accident on the floor, pick up a small amount of poop with a shovel and put it into the box so the scent may encourage them to use the litter box the next time.</p>",1075

Perkins, DVM is an accomplished veterinary expert with two decades of hands-on small animal clinical experience in private practice and shelters. She founded the award-winning mobile veterinary practice, ""The Housecall Vet,"" and co-founded a small animal and exotics hospital.</p><p> Dr.</p><p>Caring for a new kitten can be exciting, but it is also a huge responsibility. Most people know they must take care of the basics like food, water, and housing, but there are so many other things to consider. So before a decision is made to bring home a kitten, make sure you know what is needed to provide them with the best chance of living a healthy and happy life.</p><p>Routine health visits, vaccinations, parasite screening and prevention, and spaying and neutering, are all vital to a pet's overall health. But did you know your kitten's dental health is just as important? More than half of cats over the age of three suffer from dental disease. Cats have some of the same dental issues as dogs, yet feline dental care is probably the most over-looked and undertreated. This article will focus on kitten dental care, including the normal make up of the kitten's oral cavity, a common dental condition and how it is treated, and how owners can take care of their kitten's teeth at home.</p><h2>Kitten Teeth and Teething</h2><p>Cats, like humans, have two sets of teeth in their lifetime. Their kitten teeth also referred to as primary, milk, or deciduous teeth, and then their permanent, or adult teeth. Kittens are born without visible teeth. Around three weeks of age, their kitten teeth will begin to erupt. By four months of age, all of their 26 primary teeth, should be visible. By the time a kitten reaches six to seven months, all of their 30 permanent teeth should have erupted.</p><p>Before adult teeth erupt through the gums, they start to develop from tooth buds located in the upper and lower jaws. As the adult teeth develop they will start pressing against the roots of the baby teeth, and then things get a little complicated. The teething process usually begins around 11 to 12 weeks of age. During this time kittens may experience drooling, difficulty eating, and may be slightly irritable. Most kittens will have an urge to chew on things, usually the wrong thing! A characteristic breath odor may also be noted. This odor is normal and should subside once the teething process is over.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>While your kitten is teething, try to redirect their chewing to acceptable objects such as approved chew toys. Don't allow them to chew on things that could potentially damage their teeth.</p><h2>Retained Deciduous Teeth</h2><p>By the time a kitten is about six to seven months old, the adult teeth should be in. Sometimes, the kitten teeth fail to fall out and it continues to occupy space where only the adult teeth should be. When deciduous (kitten) teeth don't fall out to make way for the permanent teeth, they are called retained deciduous teeth. Retained deciduous teeth should be surgically extracted once they are discovered to avoid dental problems.</p><p>When deciduous and permanent teeth are trying to occupy the same space, this double row of teeth overcrowds the mouth, and food gets trapped between the teeth. Trapped food can cause periodontal disease, an infection of the tissue that holds the teeth in place. In addition, the double sets of teeth mean there will be double sets of roots. This will prevent normal development of the tooth's socket and will eventually erode gum support around the adult tooth. Surgical removal of retained deciduous teeth gives adult teeth the space needed to develop properly.</p><h2>Home Dental Care and Prevention</h2><h3>Toothpaste and Brushing</h3><p>If you start brushing your kitten's teeth at an early age, they may be more accepting of it when they are older and their adult teeth come in. Make sure to use a toothbrush and paste that is approved for cats. Do not use human toothpaste. Toothpaste comes in a variety of flavors for cats, including chicken and tuna. Find one that your kitten likes and try to brush their teeth at least three times a week, more if they will let you!</p><h3>Dental Wipes, Rinses, and Pads</h3><p>When kittens get a little older, they may not tolerate brushing. Some animals, especially those with tender gums, will not tolerate brushing but are more amenable to disinfecting wipes or pads. Dental wipes, rinses, and pads will wipe off plaque deposits from the surface of the tooth and. They aren't helpful in removing food particles out of the gum socket, but they are probably the next best thing to brushing. These products are best used daily.</p><h3>Dental Treats</h3><p>Treats are not a replacement for brushing, however, kittens that have their adult teeth may benefit from chewing on a proper dental chew daily. They can substantially reduce plaque and tartar by up to 69 percent. Greenies are a great option for kittens and cats. To avoid weight gain, make sure to feed only the recommended amount of treats.</p><p>The goal of starting home dental care early on with your kitten is to prevent periodontal disease when they are older. A professional cleaning by your veterinarian may be necessary sometime during their life, but incorporating a dental care routine for your kitten in your daily schedule may reduce the number of cleanings needed in the future.</p><p>References</p><h3>Watch Now: Puppy Teething Basics</h3>",894
76,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-feeding-schedule-4169428,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>Kitten Feeding Schedule: How Much Food Kittens Need</h1>,"<h1>Kitten Feeding Schedule: How Much Food Kittens Need</h1><p>Just like human babies, kittens do a lot of growing in the first year of their lives. The kind of food and how much a kitten consumes directly affects their growth rate and development. By making sure a kitten is on a proper feeding schedule, you'll be able to monitor your kitten's growth and ensure they are receiving appropriate nutrition.</p><h2>Week One Feeding Schedule</h2><p>A kitten typically weighs about 3 to 3.7 oz. at birth but will gain weight rapidly from nursing. For the first several weeks of life, a newborn kitten will depend entirely on its mother to provide it with food. Its eyes and ears are sealed shut when it's born, so it will rely on the pheromones its mother gives off to find milk and warmth. Most kittens do just fine without human intervention, but if a kitten needs to be bottle-fed, either because the mother cat is absent, ill, or rejects the kitten, you'll want to weigh the kitten regularly to make sure its weight reflects a healthy and normal growth rate of a kitten.</p><p>A kitten will nurse for about 45 minutes at a time every 2 to 3 hours for the first week of life. The rest of the time will be spent sleeping. Kittens that are bottle-fed should consume about a tablespoon, or 15 ml, of special kitten formula at each feeding. This is very time consuming for someone who is bottle-feeding a newborn kitten, so if at all possible, you will want to try to keep the kitten with its mother or a surrogate lactating cat who can nurse it.</p><p>By the end of the first week, the ear canals of a kitten will have opened and, if it is eating appropriately, it should weigh about 4 oz. Weight gain should be monitored with the use of a gram scale, such as the kind that is used for weighing food in the kitchen.</p><h2>Weeks Two and Three Feeding Schedules</h2><p>A 2 to 3-week old kitten will still need to be fed every 2-3 hours and it should consume at least 1/2 tablespoon of formula or milk during each meal. If a kitten is nursing from its mother, you'll have to depend on how much the kitten weighs to know whether or not it is consuming enough food. Between days 8 through 18, its weight should increase to about 10 oz. and it will begin to crawl around shortly after its eyes open.</p><p>By the end of week 3, a kitten will be able to stand up and will have begun to interact with its littermates. Playing, ear-biting, wrestling, and exploring behaviors will begin and are important parts of socialization.</p><h2>Weeks Four and Five Feeding Schedules</h2><p>During weeks 4 and 5, a kitten will slowly increase how much food it consumes in a meal. Feedings will occur less frequently and a bowl of formula or other liquid kitten food should be made available for a kitten to start drinking from. By the end of week 5, a kitten should only be nursing three times a day but at each meal it should be consuming about 3 tablespoons of milk or formula.</p><p>A kitten should weigh about 14 to 16 oz. by the time it is 4 to 5 weeks of age if it is eating enough food. Towards the end of week five, you should be offering the kitten more food from a saucer than it is consuming from nursing. The food should graduate from being a liquid to eventually more of a gruel by using less and less water with canned kitten food over the course of a couple of weeks. This will be a messy stage of a kitten's life since it usually ends up walking in the food, but it is a necessary step to begin weaning it off of its mother's milk.</p><h2>Week Six Feeding Schedule</h2><p>By six weeks of age, a kitten should be eating the gruel four times a day and nursing less. The gruel should become less and less watery and dry kitten food should be introduced, along with a bowl of water.</p><p>At the end of week six, decrease meal times to only three times a day. If you have multiple kittens, be sure to provide a few bowls of canned and dry kitten food so the kittens do not become food aggressive.</p><h2>Weeks Seven and Eight Feeding Schedules</h2><p>Limited nursing sessions should still be allowed until the kittens are two months old, assuming they are all eating the kitten food that is offered to them three times a day. The mother cat may need to be separated from kittens that are relentlessly trying to nurse more than they should, but by the end of week eight, a kitten should weigh about two pounds from the combination of limited nursing and eating regular kitten food.</p><h2>Feeding a Kitten Over 8 Weeks of Age</h2><p>Once a kitten has surpassed eight weeks of age, they should be fed twice a day with normal kitten food. Solid food should not be an issue for kittens of this age but they may still try to nurse on occasion. Between eight and ten weeks of age, a kitten should be fully weaned and preparing to leave its mother if you plan to find the kitten a new home. The first vaccinations are typically administered at about eight weeks of age, so when the kittens have a vet visit, you can be sure they have been growing appropriately.</p>",910
77,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-vaccine-schedule-4165446,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>Vaccination Schedule for Kittens</h1>,"<h1>Vaccination Schedule for Kittens</h1><p>Your new kitten deserves the best start in life. This means providing everything she needs to grow and stay healthy. Vaccines are an important part of your kitten's health care plan. Basic immunizations are essential to prevent your kitten from getting sick and avoid the spread of disease.</p><h2>Why Vaccinate Your Kitten?</h2><p>When kittens are born, their immune systems are not fully developed and they are unable to fight disease on their own. Fortunately, they are able to get some protection from their mothers. Nursing mothers provide antibody-rich milk called colostrum. These maternal antibodies provide kittens with temporary immunity against illness. The length of this immunity varies from kitten to kitten. Protection from maternal antibodies generally fades after a few weeks.</p><p>There is no easy way to know exactly when a kitten is vulnerable to a specific disease. In an effort to strategically protect kittens from diseases, veterinarians administer vaccinations at strategic intervals. A vaccine is designed to trigger an immune response and prevent future infection from that disease.</p><p>All kittens need certain core vaccines, which provide immunity against the most dangerous and widespread diseases. Core vaccines are considered essential for kittens in most geographical locations.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Depending on your location and your kitten's environment, certain non-core vaccines may also be recommended. Talk to your veterinarian about your kitten's risk of exposure to these diseases.</p><h2>How Kitten Vaccinations Work</h2><p>Kittens receive a series of vaccines over an 8- to 12-week period beginning at between 6 and 8 weeks of age. Some vaccines might be given together in one injection that is called a combination vaccine. At your kitten's first veterinary exam, your vet will discuss a vaccination schedule as well as other treatments, such as deworming and beginning parasite prevention.</p><p>The vaccine injection itself is typically not very painful. Your kitten may feel a little pinch or sting, but many do not react at all.</p><p>At the first vaccine visit, your veterinarian will do an examination before vaccinating your kitten. Vaccines should never be given to a kitten with a fever or illness as the vaccine will not be effective. Giving a vaccine to a sick kitten can actually make her feel worse. </p><p>After a vaccine is administered, immunity is not immediate. It takes about seven to 10 days after the second vaccination to become effective. However, kittens with remaining maternal antibodies for that disease will not be affected by the vaccine. There is no way to be certain if a kitten still has maternal antibodies, so boosters are necessary. True immunity is uncertain until about 16 to 18 weeks of age, or until all kitten boosters are completed. Avoid exposing your kitten to unknown animals until all vaccinations have been given. </p><h2>Types of Vaccines for Kittens</h2><h2>Sample Kitten Vaccine Schedule</h2><p>Every veterinarian has certain preferences about the order and frequency of additional procedures such as examinations, deworming, and testing. Talk to your vet about the best schedule for your kitten</p><h2>Risks of Vaccinating</h2><p>Although there are some risks associated with vaccinations, they are relatively uncommon. Vaccine reactions and side effects are typically minor and often go away on their own. These may include pain and swelling at the injection site, lethargy, or a mild fever. Severe allergic reactions are less common but can be fatal if left untreated. If your kitten develops hives, facial swelling, vomiting, diarrhea, or difficulty breathing, go to the nearest open vet immediately.</p><p>Feline Injection Site Sarcomas (FISSs) have been associated with vaccinations and other injections in cats. These tumors are rare and the cause of their formation is not fully understood. While a small knot developing at a vaccination site is a common and mild reaction, have any mass at an injection site evaluated by a veterinarian if it lasts more than 3 months, is more than 2 centimeters in size, or gets larger more than a month after vaccination. Vaccines are now commonly given low on the limbs (below the elbow or knee) due to these tumors.</p><p>Because vaccinations stimulate the immune system, there is a slight risk of developing an autoimmune disorder. This is extremely uncommon when you consider the numbers of pets affected versus all the pets that are vaccinated. However, autoimmune disorders can be serious and difficult to treat. Illnesses that may occur include blood disorders, neuromuscular issues, and even skin problems.</p><p>Most veterinarians and pet experts agree that the benefits outweigh the risks when it comes to vaccines, especially for young animals. When it comes to adult boosters, many vets are embracing protocols that vaccinate less often. Once given annually, many adult vaccinations are now more likely to be recommended every three years.</p><p>Depending on your location, kitten vaccination may cost around $300 for the first year, give or take. If you've adopted your kitten group, it should come partially vaccinated, depending on its age, and that cost is part of your adoption fee. (Please note: adopting kittens this way is a great way to both save a life, and save some cash!)</p><p>After the initial kitten series of rabies vaccines, cats need to be vaccinated every three years for rabies. (If you're remembering differently, it's because a three-year vaccine is now replacing the one needed annually.)</p>",883

The kitten needs to be weaned before being placed in a new home because much of its nutrients comes from the mother cat's milk. If they are weaned too soon, it could lead to the risk of future health issues or more veterinary visits.</p><p>Staying with their mother for 12-13 weeks will help them receive the necessary nutrients to healthily and fully develop and be socialized. The extra time will allow them to play and communicate with their littermates, so they can easily adapt to their new home situation once adopted or purchased.</p><h2>Timeline for Weaning Kittens</h2><p>Mother cats will typically start to wean their kittens off their milk at one month of age. This does not mean that this is the time that the kittens can go home, though. The next month of life is still full of essentials for a growing kitten, even if it isn't consuming its mother's milk all of the time.</p><p>The weaning process usually continues for about another month until the kittens are fully weaned between eight and 10 weeks of age. During this time, the kittens will still occasionally nurse on their mother but they will also start to eat liquid kitten food. The liquid kitten food should gradually get thicker until it is a watered-down canned kitten food or a moistened kitten kibble. Over the four to six week weaning period, the kitten will consume less and less milk from its mother. Getting a kitten used to eating dry food can take some time, so it should not be forced or rushed.</p><h2>What If the Mother Cat Is Not Around?</h2><p>If the mother cat perhaps did not survive the birth, was not healthy enough to care for kittens, got hit by a car, or if a litter of kittens was abandoned at a shelter, the kittens can still get the necessary nutrition they need and lead a healthy life with the help of humans. Some shelters will use a foster lactating cat to both nurse the kittens and socialize them or bottle-feed the kittens with kitten milk replacement formula.</p><p>Bottle-fed kittens do not receive the same care from humans as they would from a cat though. Cats teach their young important skills that we cannot duplicate as humans. Bottle-fed kittens are a huge time commitment, so if you are adopting a young bottle-fed kitten who has no mother cat, be prepared to feed, stimulate them to potty and clean them often.</p><h2>What Happens When a Kitten Is Removed From Its Mother Too Soon?</h2><p>If a kitten is taken from its mother and sent to a new home too soon, there can be some serious health consequences. The first few weeks of a kitten's life are essential for its health and body development. The colostrum and nutrients in the mother's milk are responsible for strong bone development, eye health, and full organ development, so if a kitten is weaned too soon, you could be increasing the risk of your cat developing more health issues later on. A kitten removed from its mother too soon may need nutritional supplementation and other veterinary care early on in life.</p><p>In addition to health concerns, behavioral issues can arise in kittens who were removed from their mothers too early in life. Mother cats teach their kittens' lifelong lessons and give off calming pheromones. Kittens who left their mothers too soon may have trouble grooming themselves, not know how to bury their waste in the litter box, play too rough, not know how to hunt for food, or have other behavioral problems.</p><p>A kitten that is removed from its mother too soon may also have trouble adjusting to its new home and you. Growing up with a mother and littermates is an essential part of cat socialization. Without proper socialization at a young age, the kitten may grow up to be fearful, skittish, or even aggressive. It also may not know how to properly communicate with other cats. You will need to spend significant amounts of time working with a kitten that did not spend adequate time with its mother and littermates. This will help it adapt to its new home and learn appropriate behaviors. </p><h2>The Ideal Age to Adopt a Kitten</h2><p>Ideally, kittens should go to their new home around 12 weeks of age. While some kittens can go home earlier, the closer you wait until 12 or 13 weeks, the better off the kitten will be. Your cat's chances of being healthy, well-socialized, and properly developed are dramatically increased by allowing it to spend extra time with its mother and littermates.</p>",814
79,https://www.thesprucepets.com/age-to-take-kitten-to-vet-3384892,Cats > Getting Started > Kitten Care,<h1>How to Prepare Your Kitten for Its First Vet Visit</h1>,"<h1>How to Prepare Your Kitten for Its First Vet Visit</h1><p>Adding a new kitten to the family is always exciting. Sometimes it is a pre-planned and highly anticipated event, sometimes it is a spontaneous adoption or rescue. Either way, along with shopping for all of the new necessities like food, dishes, and litter boxes, be sure to make time for that first veterinary visit and the subsequent checkups.</p><p>The first vet visit can reveal underlying issues that can affect you, your family, and other pets. Some illnesses can suddenly become serious, so it's best to find out right away if your kitten needs special treatments. For the health of everyone in your home-including the new kitty-it's important that you don't put this off.</p><h2>Before You Go</h2><p>Your new kitten should see a vet as soon as possible so its overall health can be checked. There isn't a set age for the first vet visit, though it's recommended to have an exam within 24 to 72 hours after adopting the kitten. If you already have cats in your home, it's best to go to the vet bringing the new kitten homeYour new kitten may have an illness that is not obvious to you. </p><p>Circumstances such as a rescued kitten or other urgent adoption may make a pre-adoption vet visit impossible. In this situation, keep the new arrival quarantined in a bathroom or similar space that is separate from your other pets. The kitten should have its own litter box, food bowl, and water bowl. This will reduce the chance of spreading disease or parasites to any resident cats.</p><h2>What You Need</h2><p>Whether you go straight to the vet from picking up your new kitten, or after a day or two at home, you'll need to have some things ready before the first checkup.</p><h2>Provide Health Information</h2><p>It's important for your vet to know if any and what types of treatments and vaccinations have been already been given to the kitten. When you take your kitten to the vet for the first time, be sure to bring along any paperwork you got at the adoption. If that's not available, write down the information you were told so you don't forget. Call the person you adopted the kitten from and ask any questions if necessary.</p><h2>The Physical Exam</h2><p>The staff and the vet will talk to you about your kitten's history and perform a physical examination. Your kitten will be weighed and may need a blood test to check for certain diseases. They will also look for other parasites such as fleas or mites.</p><p>The vet will examine your kitten's eyes, ears, mouth, skin, coat, and whole body. This includes palpating the abdomen to feel the organs and listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope.</p><p>A stool sample may be collected to check for intestinal parasites as well. It is often recommended to bring in a fecal sample with you if possible.</p><p>Ideally, kittens should be adopted out at the age of 8 to 10 weeks (or even older) for optimal health, weaning time, and socialization. If your kitten is young, especially 6 weeks or less, the vet will need to assess the kitten's nutrition and hydration status and provide assistance with any needed supplementation.</p><h2>Vaccinations</h2><p>The first kitten vaccination is typically administered between the ages of 6 and 9 weeks. A healthy mother cat who is up to date on her vaccinations will afford her kittens the best start in life. If your kitten is sneezing or having any other health problems, the vet will wait to vaccinate until it is healthy. </p><p>Kitten vaccine boosters will need to be done at intervals of about three weeks until your kitten reaches age 16 to 20 weeks. The rabies vaccine is generally done once at the final kitten visit. Your kitten will also be given a dewormer at several visits to treat for common kitten intestinal parasites like roundworms.</p><p>Try to get these visits scheduled in advance so your kitten doesn't miss any essential vaccines or treatments.</p><h2>Treatments</h2><p>Your veterinarian will discuss your kitten's health and preventive needs, such as heartworm prevention and flea and tick control. Recommendations for vaccines and preventive measures will be made based on your kitten's environment. Your vet is also there to help guide you through things like litter box training, nutrition, spay/neuter, and behavior.</p><h2>Preventing Problems With Your Kitten During Vet Visits</h2><p>As always, if you have any questions about your cat or wonder when you should schedule an exam, call your vet to discuss them. If your kitten becomes sick at any point, it is important to contact your vet without delay. Illnesses in kittens can become serious very quickly.</p><p>Establishing a relationship with your vet and a new pet is always smoother in a non-emergency situation. Finding out the clinic hours and who to call for emergencies will put you ahead of the game.</p>",790
80,https://www.thesprucepets.com/my-dog-chews-on-everything-4067895,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>What to Do if Your Dog Chews on Everything</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Dog Chews on Everything</h1><p>Whether or not we like it, most dogs chew. No matter how much we don 't want them to they are going to end up chewing on something. So how can you get your dog or puppy to stop trying to eat everything and destroying stuff? Let 's look at some tips.</p><h2>Why Do Dogs Chew?</h2><p>Really, dogs chew for quite a few reasons, and in dog training it is always best to look at the basic reasons why in order to stop it. The biggest reasons we see dogs chewing are instinct, boredom, stress, and fun! Just like us, your dog wants something to do, and since they can 't really work a remote control to watch Netflix, they work with what they've got.</p><p>So I would like to say first off, if your dog chews something when you are not able to correct them while they are doing it, it is too late to try to reprimand them after the fact. You just need to put your puppy away, clean up the mess and move on (no matter how mad you may be, puppies make mistakes and they cannot make the connection between something that happened earlier with being punished at a later time).</p><h2>How to Stop Chewing?</h2><p>To stop or prevent chewing in your puppy there are three things you have to do. Manage their time, provide a fun, puppy-proof environment, and get your puppy more exercise and some basic obedience training. Managing your dog's time is all about preventing them from being able to chew and redirecting them to more appropriate activities. Providing a fun environment is about setting them up for success. And of course exercise is the cure all for most dog problems!</p><h2>Managing Your Dog's Time to Prevent Chewing</h2><p>Managing your dogs time is all about integrating multiple training concepts into one place. First and foremost if your puppy is a chewer you should religiously be following the 3 Rule of Housetraining, I will recap them here but please make sure to read some of our blog posts and podcasts about the 3 Rules of Housetraining that go into more detail.</p><p>Rule 1: Inside With You on Leash</p><p>Wow, Rule 1 sounds so weird to new people, but then they try it and realize it fixes a majority of the problems you are having. It is as easy as taking an old leash you don 't really use anymore, cutting the handle (so it doesn 't get hung up on things), clip it to your dogs collar and let them drag it around.</p><p>Why should you do this? It basically becomes like a remote control for your dog in that you can easily get a hold of them when you need to. You no longer have to frantically grab for your dog's collar, you no longer have to chase them to get something away, they can no longer sneak away and chew something. You can see now why this is Rule 1?</p><p>Rule 2: Outside With You on Leash.</p><p>Now, this rule is more related to good house training practices more than it is for chewing. But, it can also help here by giving you an opportunity to work with your dog on 'Leave It' and 'Come' when called commands so it can translate to being helpful at home.</p><p>Rule 3: When You Can't Be With Your Dog, They Go in a Crate.</p><p>Getting back to the rules that help chewing, this is a big one. Think of your crate as your dog 's home. It is the safe place for them to go so that they don 't hurt themselves or any of your things. Some people view the crate as punishment, but honestly dogs are den animals and prefer having a nice quiet place to go to (especially if the crate is not used for punishment). I would also point out that even if your dog does not enjoy the crate it is dramatically better for you to come home to a dog that is been in the crate for a couple hours and is happy to see you and ready to come out as opposed to coming home to a chewed up dining room table and everyone is upset! Just remember, dogs are not birds! A crate is a temporary place for them to stay, not for long term stays.</p><p>So you can see that starting with the 3 Rules of Housetraining you can prevent certain unwanted situations. But there is one key to doing this, you still have to pay attention to your dog! If you have a dog that is prone to chewing things, you should always have one eye on them so that you can prevent them from taking the opportunity to chew something. It always amazes me how quickly a puppy can get something in his mouth!</p><h2>Provide a Fun and Puppy-proof Environment</h2><p>Even after working with people most of my life I am still amazed when talking to someone about their dog chewing and I ask what kind of toys they have and their answer is I don 't knowor well, they have one of those rubber bones. But he doesn 't really like it&rdquo;. Well, are you really surprised that he chews on your kids' toys and the pair of shoes you just bought?</p><p>First and foremost, your dog should have as good a selection of toys and chew items. My rule of thumb is that they should have as many chew items in direct relation to how voracious about playing and chewing they are.</p><p>My 2 Goldens always enjoyed chewing, but weren 't over the top about it, so we only had 4 or 6 bones in the house (of course it had to be even numbers so that they could work together on splitting them up). My mom's pair of Golden Retrievers on the other hand exist with a chew bone in their mouth, so she literally has a bucket full of them! Not because they chew them all up, but because it keeps them interested in the fact that there is that one bonethey want, and I have seen them dig through the whole bucket pulling out bones only to drop it because it is not .</p><p>Personally my bone of choice is the sterilized hollow bone. They come in either filled or unfilled variety so that if your dog has particular allergies you can fill it yourself. Speaking of, a toy with a filling is a perfect way to keep your dog entertained whether at you feet, in the crate, or heading off to board for the weekend.</p><h2>Exercise Your Puppy's Body and Mind</h2><p>Just like the 3 Rules of Housetraining this one is simple and will fix many problems. It is no secret that puppies need LOTS of exercise, and depending on the breed may need LOTS AND LOTS of exercise. But as with the lack of toys it amazes me how many people come in and don 't see this correlation. So if you are having problems with chewing, and you have already provided an enriching environment with lots of appropriate toys, then get out there and exercise your puppy!</p><p>We have written multiple articles about good games to play, please make sure you check those out. If you are not able to increase the amount of exercise your puppy gets, consider taking them to a doggy daycare or hiring a dog walker to give them an extra long walk. You would be amazed at how much that can improve their overall behavior, because as Margaret always says A tired dog can 't chew!""</p>",1267
81,https://www.thesprucepets.com/all-about-puppy-digging-4040569,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>All About Puppy Digging</h1>,"<h1>All About Puppy Digging</h1><h2>Why Puppies Dig and What You Can Do About It</h2><p>Have you noticed that puppies love to dig? Digging is as natural to pups as eating, playing, scratching and sleeping! It is important to remember that &lsquo;digging ' is only a symptom, not a &lsquo;problem '. Attempting to just stop your puppy from digging is a lot like putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg. The first step to stop digging is to discover the reason that your puppy has chosen to dig!</p><h3>Instinct</h3><p>There are many breeds of dogs that have been selectively bred to dig! I have the word &lsquo;Terrier ' literally translated as &lsquo;Earth Dog '. This means that many Terrier breeds consider digging to be as natural as breathing! Hounds such as dachshunds burrow into the ground to hunt for vermin. Take a moment and read the various tasks your pup has been selectively bred to perform.</p><h3>Coolness</h3><p>There are pups that love to dig cooling pits to escape from the sun. Many of the Northern breeds such as Huskies, Malamutes, Spitz, and Samoyeds instinctually understand how to cool themselves off. Again you will find valuable information by researching your pup 's breed or breeds for clues to her behavior!</p><h3>Boredom</h3><p>Have you ever experienced boredom? What behaviors do you do to entertain yourself to escape boredom? Are any of these behaviors wasteful or even destructive? It might be that your puppy finds digging to far more enjoyable than staring longingly at the back door! It could be that your puppy is simply having fun digging up your back yard. Is there any behavior that you do just because it is fun and you enjoy doing it? If you, the human, does things just because you enjoy them can you really be at angry with your puppy for just enjoying life? I invite you to really think about this concept!</p><h3>Freedom</h3><p>Some pups dig to pursue freedom. These pups seem to really believe that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. You can tell that your pup 's purpose is freedom when she digs at fence lines or under walls. This reason for digging is the most dangerous for your puppy! What will she do if she manages to get under that fence?</p><h2>The Rewards of Digging</h2><p>Your puppy repeats behaviors that she finds some type of reward in. She stops behaviors that do not produce some type of reward. You are wise to ask yourself what reward does your puppy receive by digging! The answer to this question is your clue to deter her digging. I encourage you to spend some time discovering the positive reinforcement your puppy gains from her digging. Your job is to change this positive reinforcement to a correction. If you are thinking this a difficult task you are correct!</p><h2>How to Stop the Digging</h2><p>I have had clients successfully deter digging by helping the environment to correct the pup 's digging behavior. These deterrents are usually not sufficient to deter instinct driven digging.</p><h3>Deterrents</h3><p>Visit a sporting goods store to purchase two or three Boat Horns. The horn is compressed air in a can that emits a loud sound as you depress a button. Watch your puppy from inside your house. As you see her start to dig open a window and sound the horn. The sudden sharp noise is likely to send your pup running from her digging activity. Please keep in mind that using sound to frighten your puppy may cause her to become afraid of loud noises such as fireworks and thunder. Use sound corrections sparingly!</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Do not underestimate the benefit of increasing your pup 's exercise level! Tired pups do not dig - they sleep. A brisk morning walk being sure to include training before leaving your pup in your yard will do wonders. An alternative would be teaching your pup to safely walk on your treadmill. If you do not currently have a treadmill, there are puppy treadmills adapted for your pup 's safety available for purchase.</p><h3>Underground Fence</h3><p>Consider having an underground fence installed around areas like flower beds and children 's play areas. This type of fence is very effective for deterring the freedom seeking pup that is trying dig under fences and walls. Basically, a wire is buried underground around areas that you do not want your pup to go. Your pup wears a collar that beeps to warn her that she is approaching the forbidden area. You will need to teach her that to avoid the electronic correction that follows the beep she needs to move away from the forbidden area!</p><h3>Pest Control</h3><p>You will be wise to have a pest control company examine your yard for things like moles. Ridding your yard of vermin that your pup knows is there even if you don 't is a simple solution to instinctual hunting digging. Pest control is very effective for removing temptation from your pup 's life!</p><h3>Goalie</h3><p>It is important to ask yourself the question Who 's yard is this? ' Just opening the door and allowing your pup to run into the yard is the second best way of letting your pup know that she owns the yard. Dog doors are the best way to tell your pup that she owns both the house and the yard! I do not have a dog door nor do I ever imagine a situation when I will have one. I want my own pups to understand that I pay the mortgage, therefore the house and yard belong to me! I am happy to allow them to enjoy both with my blessings and permission. I hope that if you use a dog door that you do not have any destructive issues either in your house or yard.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>When was the last time that you went out to the yard with your pup to practice training? I invite you to reap the benefits of training at the scene of the crime! It does more harm than good to drag your pup to the hole to punish her for digging. It does a world of good to take her near her digging and practice training sessions! The message you are giving her is that you expect her to listen to you in the yard as well as the house. She will get the message! Skeptical? I invite you to try for two weeks and notice the attitude adjustments in your pup 's yard behavior.</p><h2>Plan Your Yard</h2><p>Let 's turn our focus from deterrents to current behavior to future planning! There are ways to restructure your pup 's yard to help her avoid trouble. My youngest grandchild, Charlie, loves to dig! She loves dirt, sand, mud puddles, sawdust - if she can dig her fingers into it, then she is delighted. In fact, in many ways, Charlie reminds of a lovable smart energetic Terrier! Her parents wisely installed a large covered sandbox to encourage Charlie to dig in a place they found appropriate. For the most part, it really solved the issue- and when it did not they a place to redirect Charlie instead of trying to punish her!</p><p>Enrich your pup 's yard! Tie tether balls to tree branches and teach her how to play with the ball. Provide interesting puzzle toys to entertain your puppy. Install some fun backyard agility equipment, like a tunnel and a short A-frame or a slightly raised dog bridge. Spend some time observing what your puppy loves to play with! Provide her with fun activities to divert her attention from destroying your yard.</p>",1247

Puppies are definitely a lot of work, but they also bring plenty of joy to your world. Whether you are getting your first puppy or just need a refresher course, here's what you'll need to know to get your puppy on the right track to adulthood.</p><h2>Choosing the Right Puppy</h2><p>If the time is right for getting a puppy, you will now have to choose the best match. Perhaps your future companion will find you. A puppy can come into your life by chance and you can feel an instant connection and know it is the right one, but it doesn't always happen like that. Often, you must take on the important task of going out and finding the right kind of puppy for you.</p><p>First, examine your lifestyle and consider what you are looking for in a puppy. Purebred or mixed breed dog? Big or small? There are even more factors to consider, such as grooming and exercise needs, temperament, and potential health issues.</p><p>Next, you need to decide where to look for your new puppy. Will you visit an animal shelter to adopt your new dog? Perhaps you will seek out a responsible breeder. Research and patience are essential throughout this process. When you have finally found the right puppy, you'll have a friend for life.</p><h2>Getting Your Home Ready for Puppy</h2><p>Before you bring home your cute little furball, you need to ensure that your home is as safe as possible, both for your new puppy and your belongings. The puppy-proofing process is similar to toddler-proofing a home, but there are differences.</p><p>First, get an idea of the puppy-eye-view of your home. Electrical cords, potential toxins, and breakable items should be placed completely out of reach. Remember that your puppy can jump, climb, chew, and scratch, so place what you can very high up or in a locked cabinet.</p><p>Be aware that ""child-safe"" latches do not tend to work on curious and determined puppies. It's best to secure lower cabinets and drawers with locks or metal hardware. These should be chew-proof and require opposable thumbs to operate.</p><h2>Naming Your Puppy</h2><p>As your puppy joins the family, the all-important job of naming this new addition is a priority. Obviously, you will be using your dog's name constantly throughout his life, so your choice should be a wise one.</p><p>Pick something that has a nice ring to it and is not too long. It should be easy to say and simple for your puppy to understand. It's also important that your dog's name does not sound too similar to other words you plan to teach it.</p><p>You may want to name your puppy something that describes its personality or appearance. Or, you may want something unique. Once you have chosen a name, use it plenty. Before long, your puppy will learn its name and respond to it.</p><h2>Essential Puppy Supplies</h2><p>Your new puppy will need certain items from the very start. Some are essential for your pup's well-being, while others are quite helpful. Most important items include a leash and collar with identification, food and water bowls, and chew toys. You should also get a comfortable dog bed and, preferably, a crate or kennel.</p><p>Some of these items can last as your puppy ages but many of them will need to be replaced as your puppy grows. Collars may be adjustable up to a certain point. A kennel can be purchased in a larger size for the future but should be blocked off with boxes or other objects to make it the right size for the puppy.</p><h2>Choosing Your Puppy's Food</h2><p>Your puppy's diet can make all the difference in its future health and well-being. Before you decide on a puppy food, do your research. Talk to your vet, other pet professionals, and fellow dog owners. Remember that if the food you initially choose does not meet your expectations, you can gradually switch to another food.</p><h2>Keeping Your Puppy Healthy</h2><p>Preferably, you will find a veterinarian before you get a puppy. Within a few days of taking your new puppy home, you should bring it to your vet for a general exam. Take steps to make it a good experience so your puppy will be less likely to fear the vet's office.</p><p>Your vet can help identify any potential health problems early on, and advise you on caring for your dog long-term. The initial visit also opens the doors of communication with you and your vet. To help keep your puppy's expenses down, you may consider purchasing pet health insurance, which could cover up to 80 percent of your dog's health care costs.</p><h2>Puppy Vaccinations</h2><p>Vaccines protect your puppy and other dogs from potentially fatal illnesses. Just like human babies, puppies (and kittens) need basic immunizations to take over when maternal antibodies fade. The puppy vaccination series is one of the most important aspects of your dog's early life.</p><p>Unfortunately, pet vaccination has become controversial for those who fear vaccines in general. That's part of the reason many vets are moving towards a three-year protocol (rather than annual) for adult dogs. However, when it comes to puppies, there is a different set of rules as the threat of vaccine-preventable diseases is extremely high for dogs. Not only may your new puppy die from these illnesses, but some of them can also be spread to humans.</p><h2>House Training Your New Puppy</h2><p>House training is one of the first things you will teach your new puppy. This process can sometimes be quite arduous, though some puppies catch on earlier than others.</p><p>You should begin house-training as soon as you bring your puppy home, but it takes patience. Puppies are generally not able to control their bladders and bowels until about 12 weeks of age. If your puppy is younger than this, just be patient.</p><p>Starting early can help get your puppy into a routine. As your dog grows and develops control over its bodily functions, it will already know what to do. As a general rule, you should take your puppy to the designated ""potty spot"" immediately after eating or drinking. However, accidents happen, so be prepared, consistent, and patient.</p><h2>Basic Puppy Training and Socialization</h2><p>Beyond housebreaking, there are many more things you will need to teach your dog. Start by working on socialization. Next, leash training will set the stage for teaching basic commands, like sit, come, and stay. Teaching various basic commands can help you curb some behavior problems.</p><p>Just remember that puppies are curious, active, and teething. They put everything in their mouths, including your hands. Work with this by replacing the inappropriate object with an acceptable toy or safe chew. Distract your dog from mischievous behavior by offering something more pleasing, like a game, walk, or other activity. Reward your puppy with treats or praise for shifting his attention.</p><h2>Bonding With Your Puppy</h2><p>The bond you have with your puppy begins the moment it comes into your life and never stops growing. You can nurture this bond through affection, training, grooming, playtime, general exercise, and participation in various activities. You may want to join an obedience class, start training in dog sports like agility and flyball, or participate in dog shows.</p><p>One of the kindest ways to bond with your dog and allow your dog to bond with others is to get involved with animal-assisted therapy. If your puppy is right for therapy, it can begin training to visit people in hospitals and nursing homes or help children to read and learn. Strengthening and preserving the human-canine bond benefits the health and well-being of both you and your puppy.</p>",1258
83,https://www.thesprucepets.com/teaching-your-dog-to-hold-it-2804708,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to House Train Your New Puppy</h1>,"<h1>How to House Train Your New Puppy</h1><h2>Tips, Tricks, and Tools for House Training</h2><p>Few people have the option of taking puppy leave to stay home to house train their new puppies. That means your puppy will almost certainly be spending hours at home alone. Not only will you need to train your puppy to eliminate outside, but you'll also need to train it to hold off on elimination until you're home and ready to go outside. This can take time and patience; puppies typically have no more ability to hold it than a very young child.</p><h2>Is Your Puppy Ready for Elimination Training?</h2><p>The younger your puppy is, the more often it will need to eliminate. Maturity plays a part in house training puppies. A general rule is that your puppy can hold its urine one hour for each month of age plus one additional hour. So if your puppy is 2 months old, then it could possible hold urine for up to three hours. However, young puppies may need to go out much more frequently. In addition to using the age calculation, you can also judge your puppy's maturity by noticing how many motion-driven accidents your puppy has, as compared to intention-driven.</p><p>Motion-driven accidents happen as your puppy is romping through the house, squats, then keeps running. As a puppy grows, motion driven elimination tends to decrease, but while your puppy is young it will occur. Keep in mind that since you didn't know your puppy was going to go and it didn't know it was going to go, there is no reason to try to redirect motion driven accidents. Instead, concentrate your redirection efforts on intention-driven accidents.</p><h2>Are YOU ready for Elimination Training?</h2><p>To help your puppy be as successful as possible, you will need to be prepared in advance with knowledge, a plan, a schedule and some realistic expectations. Everyone in the household will need to understand and be on board with the plan. A puppy will get confused and frustrated and anxious if it is not able to predict and understand its human family members.</p><p>To make house training as easy as possible, you will need to do a few things.</p><h3>Define Your Puppy's Space and Schedule</h3><p>Your puppy will find it easier to eliminate in the right time and place if it stays in a limited area for a defined amount of time. If you are not actively playing with or watching your puppy it should be crated or attached to you by a leash or other tether so that you are able to notice where it is at all times. This not only avoids accidents and improves success of house training, it prevents unwanted ingestion of dangerous items, and other destructive and potentially dangerous behavior. At least for some time, it's best to keep your puppy in the largest space it will keep clean and not chew up.</p><p>In addition to crates, your options include baby gates and exercise pens. Baby gates are a great way to keep your puppy in a selected room without isolating it from the family. Indoor exercise pens are the perfect way to give your puppy more room when you have to leave it for longer than four hours. When using an exercise pen or baby gate, it's a good idea to place your puppy's crate in one corner of the pen with the door open, its water in another corner, and the area that you are training it to eliminate in away from these other areas. This will help it make the choice of using the elimination area instead of its crate or water bowl.</p><h3>Figure Out What You Want Them to Eliminate On</h3><p>Ideally, your dog would be trained to eliminate on grass. This sets it up for long term success and prevents accidents and confusion as your puppy grows. The common use of puppy pads tends to confuse puppies and can sometimes allow them to develop a ""substrate preference"" for urinating and defecating on softer textures. This means your throw rugs, laundry or anything soft on the floor could potentially be seen as okay to urinate and or defecate on.</p><p>OK, we have defined our space and schedule, and planned for what we are training them to urinate on. Now, how do we maximize success of them urinating in that spot, so we can praise and reward and start developing positive reinforcement with our desired plan, while avoiding the accidents that will inevitably happen as much as possible?</p><h3>Learn the Subtle Signs that Your Puppy needs to go potty</h3><p>In general, it is good to take your pup out every 30 minutes to an hour if they are not crated. Take them out as soon as you or guests arrive home to avoid accidents when they are excited. Remember, the hour-per-month plus one rule noted above. Your puppy should not be expected to hold urine for any longer than that, and some small breeds will have even smaller windows.</p><p>The goal here is to prevent the accidents from even occurring. This helps improve the positive bond between you and your new pup and avoids the accidents from attracting future accidents.</p><h3>Pick your Potty Phrase</h3><p>To help your puppy learn to eliminate on command, you will want to pick a word or phrase ahead of time to use consistently when taking your pet to pee or poop. It is important that everyone in the household use the same word to help decrease confusion and improve efficacy of training. Phrases such as ""go potty,"" ""use the grass,"" and others are commonly used. Whatever you pick, say it in an upbeat way and be consistent.</p><h3>Be Prepared to Praise</h3><p>Because you have done such a great planning, you will need to be prepared to praise your pup when it gets it right. Carry small treats and keep them as out of sight as possible so as to not distract your puppy. When your puppy pees or poops, tell it ""great job"" and immediately give them a treat. Make successful urination and defecation a big deal. The sooner you can associate a positive reward with the desired behavior, the quicker the pup will learn!</p><h2>When Training Is Difficult</h2><p>If you find that your pup is having accidents in the house more than you would like, go back to square one. Get back on a strong schedule, make the space that your puppy has access to smaller. Make sure you have thoroughly cleaned all previously soiled areas. It is common for people to think the pup ""gets it"" and allow them too much access too soon. Just remember to go slow and if you think your pup is backsliding, don't get frustrated, just go back to basics.</p><p>If your pup is routinely soiling in the crate, switch to a larger space as soon as possible. Dogs can sometimes lose the desire to keep the sleeping place clean and this can make them more difficult to potty train going forward. You can restore a puppy's cleanliness instincts by giving it the choice of a clean crate with the door open, water bowl, and food bowl in one area and your preferred substrate (aka grass or any other surface that does not resemble a common household surface) in another area.</p><p>If house-training is not going well at all, reach out to your veterinarian and have your pup checked for urinary tract infections or other issues that maybe preventing it from being successful. Go over your routine with your vet and see if they can recommend any changes or a trainer that may be able to guide your further.</p>",1251
84,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-do-people-get-puppies-4047832,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Why Do People Get Puppies?</h1>,"<h1>Why Do People Get Puppies?</h1><p>When you stroll through the park and notice the plethora of puppies walking around you, you may start to wonder why do people get dogs. There are all kinds of reasons people get dogs -from companionship to an exercise in responsibility to security -but puppies are a bit of another matter. Puppies are cute, require training, and have an extra dose of playfulness and goofiness compared to older dogs that make them extra fun for some people. Here are the most common reasons why people get puppies. (Be warned: you may be tempted to get one too!)</p><h2>People Adopt Puppies Because They Are Cute</h2><p>As a person who has worked with dogs most of his life, you would think that at some point I may get desensitized to the sight of a fluffy, cuddly little puppy. But I can tell you that that is not the case. And hopefully, there is never a day where I am so jaded that I feel that way. So when talking about this topic, you cannot discount the first reason people get a puppy is their immense adorable factor.</p><p>That's number one. You really can't blame anyone for having this as their first persuasive argument as to why they need to get a puppy. Who doesn't want a tiny teddy bear?? Or a big headed bull puppy running around the house trying to figure out how to use stairs and not tip over when they eat dinner? (Please note that puppies are not live stuffed animals, small people in a stuffed animal's body, nor an actual mini bear. Please respect your puppy's canine needs.)</p><p>One of the hardest truths of the animal industry is that puppies grow up, and that adorable, fluffy puppy grows into a mature and proportionally filled out version of her younger self. This certainly is not a bad thing, it is really just a fact of life, but some people can become disappointed that their puppy is no longer the cute fluff ball they once were. It has prompted a few of those people to try to find a new home for their dog.</p><p>When considering getting a puppy, it always important to remember that they grow up! I know it seems obvious, but it is easy to forget that the 10-pound Great Dane puppy in just a few months can weigh 100-pounds, and eat 6 cups of expensive dog food per day! If you're not sure you will be able to handle the grown-up version of this little puppy, then it may not be the time to get one.</p><h2>People Adopt Puppies to Raise Them the Way They Want</h2><p>Another reason we hear very often from people about why they want to get a puppy, as opposed to an older dog, is so that they have a chance to bond with it as a puppy, and to ensure that socialization gets done properly. To be honest, this is a big one for us. Starting a puppy the right way in life with training, socialization, handling, and desensitization is a key to having the dog you have always wanted. But, if you are not able to spend the time doing the training if you do not have the skill, or you don't have the money to be able to hire help, then you have set up a situation that just makes your life harder down the road.</p><p>Your own ability to assess how well you can take on the task of socializing and laying a foundation for a puppy is key here. Are you able to commit to taking a puppy new places, slowly introducing them to new dogs you know will be respectful of a puppy, and work to show them that things they may not like sometimes have to be done (like holding their paws to trim their nails)?</p><h2>People Adopt Puppies as Practice Kids</h2><p>Practice kids! Ah, this one is a reason I see A LOT (whether or not people admit it out loud). A nice couple in their early 20s decides to get a puppy together to make their new house a home. It is such a great way to work together and learn how good you are at raising something together before you have kids, right? Well, yes and no. Raising a puppy has some of the same requirements as raising a child (but with much lower responsibility levels). So for the couple, this can be a great test. But what happens as the puppy gets older? What happens when you are successful and responsible at keeping this little life going, and it is now time to step up to the big show and have kids? Where does the dog fall into this? She has spent her whole life as your loyal practice kid, living up to her potential and being everything she can be for you. It is not the time to put the dog aside because you are ready to move on. Life always evolves, and we readily move to new stages of it, but just remember to bring your dog along and prepare them for the next phase of the family adventure by getting them ready for a new child.</p><h2>People Adopt Puppies to Round out Their Childfree Lifestyle</h2><p>Substitute kids! The DINK family is quickly becoming a model adopted by a lot of people. Living childfree is no longer looked at the way it once was, and a big part of that lifestyle is often our pets. To be honest, this is me. I LOVE being an uncle and hanging out with my nieces and nephew, but one of the best parts is sending them home at the end of our time together! This leaves me able to carry on with so many other things I wouldn't have the opportunity for if I had to look after children. But, this also makes the relationship with my dogs so much more important to me. The dogs are my choice for children because of the simplicity, convenience, and responsibility level. I know a lot of other people who are opting for the same thing.</p><h2>What Are Some Alternatives to Adopting a Puppy Right Now?</h2><p>So I have laid out all of this info for you, right? What if I made a point that makes you think a puppy isn't for you&hellip; is all hope lost? Nope. When deciding whether or not to get a puppy, what I said is only one part of the equation. Your friends and family and lifestyle and experiences may change all of the points I made.</p><h2>Why You May Want to Adopt an Adult Dog Instead of a Puppy</h2><p>There are a few other things to think about as alternatives to getting a puppy. First and foremost, what about a grown dog? Adopting a grown dog (2+ years old) will help make your energy, training, and socialization needs easier in some ways. Most of the puppy and adolescent angst has subsided, and often times the personality you see now is fairly set. Of course, you can teach an old dog new tricks, so even an older dog can be a great student.</p><h2>Why You May Want to Adopt a Senior Dog Instead of a Puppy</h2><p>One of the saddest realities of our pet adoption system is that older animals get less love. People often don't want to take on the health problems and shortened lifespan of adopting a senior pet. I can certainly understand the hesitation to get attached to a dog that may only be in your life another few years. But at the same time, having an older dog allows for a very casual lifestyle.</p>",1265
85,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppies-three-to-six-months-4570930,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Development From 3 to 6 Months</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Development From 3 to 6 Months</h1><p>During 3-6 months of age, puppies go through some major physical and behavioral changes like growing into its adult size, teething, and being fearful of new places and people. Be prepared to care for your puppy during this crucial development stage.</p><p>Puppies are typically placed in homes between 8 to 12 weeks of age. If you're adopting or purchasing a young puppy, there's a good chance the puppy is nearing 12 weeks of age (three months old). Between 12 to 16 weeks of age, your puppy may destructively chew on toys or household items and become fearful of its surroundings. It's crucial to have a consistent exercise routine and reward system for proper, calm behavior.</p><h2>Physical Development</h2><p>Around 12 weeks of age, puppies begin to have better control of their bladders and bowels. They may begin to sleep through the night without accidents or potty breaks. House training may begin to go more smoothly over the coming weeks. Make sure you keep to a fairly regular schedule. Most dogs can be fully house trained by age four to five months.</p><p>By 12 weeks of age, your puppy will have begun teething. You may notice excessive biting and chewing, bruised or red gums, and teeth missing from the mouth. You may even find the occasional baby tooth! When teething, some puppies become frustrated or agitated. They may ""act out"" more or be picky about food on certain days. Be sure to provide plenty of puppy-safe toys during this time. Teething should slow down around 16 weeks, or four months of age. All adult teeth will be in by six months of age.</p><p>Between 12-16 weeks of age, your puppy will begin to look a little bit less like a baby puppy and a little more like a miniature version of the dog she will become. She will likely grow rapidly from four to six months of age. By six months of age, your puppy will be closer to her future adult size. Most small dog breeds will be nearly finished growing at six months of age. Large and giant dog breeds may be at about half their adult size. Medium dogs still have some more growing left to do, but they are usually about 75% grown by the age of six months.</p><h2>Behavior Changes</h2><p>Your 12-week-old puppy is nearing the end of a critical socialization window. Make the most of this time period by exposing your dog to new people, places, and things. Until your dog is fully vaccinated, she should not be around unknown animals or on the ground in public places. Try to have a variety of people and healthy animals visit your home and have a positive experience with your puppy. You can take your dog to homes where you know the pets are vaccinated and healthy. Carry your dog in public spaces, exposing her to loud noises, falling objects, and small crowds. Work on puppy handling exercises, so she gets used to being handled. While socializing your puppy, always keep things positive and upbeat.</p><p>Puppies typically experience a period of fearfulness around 16 weeks of age. This is a normal part of your puppy's social development as she learns how to react to her environment. Avoid overwhelming your pup when you notice fearful reactions. This is not the time for loud noises, falling objects, or crowds of people. It is also important not to reward fearful behavior, or you will be confirming your puppy's fears. Instead, ignore the fearful behavior and gently remove your puppy from the source of the fear. Reward calm, happy behavior instead.</p><p>A dog's adolescence usually starts around six months of age and will continue until she is 18 months to 2&frac12; years of age, depending on the breed. Expect to see a bit of a rebellious side to your puppy as she begins to test her limits. You may notice your dog ignoring cues that she was previously trained on. She may also have some destructive chewing in this stage (caused by a combination of teething, general juvenile misbehaving, and possibly boredom). Make sure your puppy gets plenty of exercise and keep working on training regularly. Be consistent and firm.</p><h2>Health and Care</h2><p>Your puppy will need to visit the veterinarian regularly for puppy vaccines, deworming, and routine check-ups between the ages of 8 to 16 weeks. During this time period, it is important to keep your puppy away from unknown animals and public spaces where other animals may have been. When vaccines are completed, and your vet gives the all-clear, your puppy can begin to go on walks, visit the park, and play with other dogs (under careful supervision, of course).</p><p>After four months of age, most puppies will not need to see the vet for a routine visit until adulthood. At the final puppy visit (usually when the rabies vaccine is given, around 16 weeks of age) be sure to ask any remaining questions. Talk to your veterinarian about the best way to care for your fast-growing puppy.</p><h2>Food and Nutrition</h2><p>Proper food and nutrition is an essential part of your puppy's development. Be sure you are feeding puppy food (dog food labeled for growth) and that you are feeding the appropriate amount. Your puppy will need more and more food as she grows. During this time of rapid growth, evaluate the amount you feed your puppy at least once a week to determine if you need to adjust it. Commercial diets will have a feeding chart based on the puppy's age and weight. If you choose to feed homemade puppy food, you will need to take extra care to feed the appropriate recipe and calorie content.</p><p>When feeding treats, make sure they are healthy, non-toxic, and not fed in excess. Dog treats should never make up more than 10% of your puppy's daily food intake.</p> <h2>Training</h2><p>You should begin training your puppy the moment she comes home with you. One of the first things you will focus on is house training. Most puppies begin to get the hang of this between 12 and 16 weeks of age and will be fully house trained by about four or five months old.</p><p>It is also important to focus on obedience training. Teach your puppy basic commands like sit, stay, and down. Train the recall cue as soon as possible. You will also need to teach manners, like not to jump up, not to bark excessively, and not to bite (many puppies are especially mouthy between 12 to 16 weeks old).</p><p>Leash training is important at this stage of your puppy's life. After 16 weeks of age, you can begin to walk your dog in public. Start getting your pup used to the leash no later than 12 weeks of age. Then, train your pup to walk on the leash. Start in your house, then move to your yard. Work your way up to the outdoors.</p><p>One of the best ways to start your puppy's training is by signing up for a puppy training class. Classes are run by experienced trainers who can help guide you through basic training and even address some minor puppy behavior problems. The classes contain small groups of healthy, vaccinated puppies. Puppy training classes can help socialize your dog and enable her to learn despite distractions.</p>",1237
86,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-development-from-8-to-12-weeks-4586406,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Development From 8 to 12 Weeks</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Development From 8 to 12 Weeks</h1><p>During 8-12 weeks of age, many puppies join their new homes leaving their mothers, littermates, and infancy behind. During this developmental period, called the imprinting stage, the brain is rapidly developing, and the dog is impressionable and ideal for training. Many veterinarians recommend waiting until a puppy is at least 12 weeks old before having them leave their littermates.</p><p>The puppy is picking up its good and bad behavior tendencies from their experiences and environment during this critical learning period. It's important to take a look at a pup's physical and behavioral milestones, as well as its health and nutrition needs during this vital puppy stage.</p><h2>Physical Development</h2><p>An 8- to 12-week-old puppy will still be quite small, even if the puppy is a large dog breed. Puppies are physically vulnerable and a bit clumsy. They need plenty of supervision and crating when alone.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Expect your puppy to sleep up to 18 to 20 hours a day to support their fast-growing brains and bodies. Puppies at this age may seem to go from zero to 60 out of nowhere, then suddenly fall asleep within minutes of being in overdrive.</p><h3>House Training</h3><p>Before 12 weeks of age, most puppies will have trouble controlling their urination and defecation. They are prone to frequent accidents and cannot usually make it through the night without urinating. House training should begin as soon as you bring your new puppy home, but be prepared for the first few weeks to go slowly. Stick to a regular schedule, taking your puppy outside every time it eats, drinks, or wakes up from a nap. Take your puppy to a designated ""potty spot."" Reward them when they go in the right spot. After a few weeks, it will learn to have better control over its bodily functions.</p><h3>Teething</h3><p>Your puppy won't begin to get adult teeth until about 16 weeks of age, depending on the breed. Some of its baby teeth or ""milk teeth"" may start falling out between 8 to 12 weeks of age. Signs of teething typically won't start until 12 weeks old. You know your dog is teething when you begin to notice excessive drooling, excessive chewing, pawing at the mouth, and bloody residue left behind on chewed items.</p><h2>Behavioral Changes</h2><p>The time from 3 weeks to 12 weeks is a critical socialization period. This time is often called a ""fear stage"" as puppies may seem to be afraid of everything. Practice handling your puppy so it can get used to being held and touched in unfamiliar ways.</p><p>Expect your young puppy to react with fear in some situations, but avoid coddling or comforting a timid pup. Find ways to introduce new sights, sounds, and environments like vet visits, nail trims, and baths and keep everything positive.</p><p>Reward your puppy for relaxing in new situations and exploring new things. However, don't push your puppy to accept a situation that scares it. It will eventually learn that there is nothing to worry about if you remain calm and upbeat. Act as if the situation is regular and routine.</p><h2>Health and Care</h2><p>Between 6 and 8 weeks of age, your puppy will need to visit the veterinarian for its first puppy vaccines, deworming, and an examination. The breeder or adoption group might have administered its first vaccines and deworming and taken the puppy to the vet. Regardless, you should take your new puppy to your veterinarian within a few days of getting it to make sure it is in good health. Bring any records provided by the breeder or adoption group so your vet can adjust or prescribe a vaccination schedule.</p><h3>Disease Prevention</h3><p>By 18 weeks of age, the puppy should have all its vaccinations. But until then, you need to prevent exposure to diseases. Do not allow your puppy to walk in highly populated dog areas or interact with unfamiliar animals. Your puppy can play with healthy puppies and adult dogs that have been vaccinated and dewormed. Make sure you know the owner of the other dog and can trust that the dog is healthy.</p><h2>Food and Nutrition</h2><p>Puppies begin weaning off their mother's milk around 3 to 6 weeks of age and are typically fully weaned between 6 to 8 weeks. By the time you get your new puppy, it should already be eating puppy food for at least a few weeks. The breeder or adopter should provide you with information about the type of food it is eating.</p><h3>Puppy Food</h3><p>Start with the same diet, if possible. Allow your new puppy to adjust to its environment for a few days or weeks before you choose a new food. If you decide to change the food, be sure to transition to the new food gradually to avoid gastrointestinal upset.</p><p>Your puppy needs proper nutrition to grow and thrive. Provide a high-quality puppy food labeled for growth. Most puppies between 8 to 12 weeks of age should eat three times a day, spaced out somewhat evenly. This regularity in mealtime helps prevent blood sugar drops, especially in very small breeds.</p><h3>How Much Should You Feed a Puppy?</h3><p>Start by feeding the amount recommended on the packaging for your dog's weight. Check your dog's weight every few days to see if the feeding amount needs to be adjusted. If your puppy seems voracious and does not seem to be gaining weight, adjust by adding more food. Reduce the offering if it leaves a lot behind. At your veterinarian visits, discuss the type of food you are feeding, the frequency of feeding, and the amount you feed per day vs. the amount consumed. Ask your veterinarian if you need to make any dietary adjustments.</p><h3>Homemade Dog Food</h3><p>If you wish to feed homemade puppy food, you can, but you will need to do so very cautiously, as a poorly-constructed diet can be dangerous at this time which is why it is often not recommended. Consult with your veterinarian about the recipe you plan to use. Never assume a homemade diet you find online is properly balanced as most are not. You will need to make sure it is a balanced, nutritious recipe, using the right ingredients, and an adequate number of calories.</p><h2>Training</h2><p>Even though your puppy is still a baby, it's essential to start training as soon as it comes home with you. Start simple. Teach your puppy its name. You should give the dog a couple of days to get used to the house rules, such as where it is allowed to go and where the forbidden zones are in the house.</p><p>Let it get used to the feeling of a collar before adding a leash. Then, you can start letting the dog drag the leash around, so it understands the feel of it. As soon as the dog seems comfortable with it, you can start training it to walk on the leash.</p><p>Although this is a rapid learning period, your puppy may not be the fastest learner at first since there are many ""firsts,"" new scents, places, and people all starting to come into focus. You can even begin to introduce some basic commands like sit, stay, and down. Go slow, be patient, keep it positive, and have fun.</p><p>Many puppies won't sleep through the night until they're about four months old, so you will need to take it out once or twice until then.</p><p>Puppies this age can walk for about 15 minutes. A good way to figure out how far your puppy can walk is five minutes per month of age. Therefore, three months equals 15 minutes. Make sure not to walk in the middle of a hot day or on pavement and pay attention to the weather just like you would with an adult dog.</p>",1267
87,https://www.thesprucepets.com/wish-i-knew-before-first-puppy-4060160,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>7 Things to Know Before Getting Your First Puppy</h1>,"<h1>7 Things to Know Before Getting Your First Puppy</h1><p>There are a variety of things you need to do before getting a puppy to prepare yourself and your home for a new fuzzy friend. There are a lot of decisions to make and factors to consider before you decide to bring home a new puppy -where should the puppy sleep on its first night, who will be around to take care of it, do you have all the supplies on hand? Don't give in to impulse and take home a puppy at the wrong time. Do your research first. Learn if you are ready to have a puppy and find out how to get one responsibly. Get educated on how to prepare for your new puppy and how to raise that puppy well.</p><h2>Are You Ready for a Puppy?</h2><p>Puppies may be irresistible, but they are also extremely time-consuming. If you have never had a puppy, then you might not realize what you're about to get into. It's one thing to be ready to get a dog, especially an adult dog. Raising a puppy requires an even higher level of commitment.</p><p>Young puppies need to be fed three to four times a day. They need to be taken outside immediately after eating or drinking so they can eliminate appropriately and become house trained. Puppies will have accidents in the house while they are still being house-trained. That can mean a lot of clean up.</p><p>A puppy might wake you up several times during the night. It might be because the puppy needs to go outside, or it might just be because the puppy is bored.</p><p>A young puppy can't be left alone for more than a few hours. The puppy should stay in a crate when alone; this aids in house training and keeps the puppy from chewing up everything in your house. However, after a few hours, a puppy can't hold its bladder (and sometimes bowels too).</p><p>Puppies can be destructive. They want to explore, chew, lick, and possibly even eat things in their environment. They don't know manners and may act unruly or hyperactive. All puppies need to be trained and socialized; they also need a lot of exercise. These things take a lot of time.</p><p>Are you prepared to come home from work midday to care for your puppy? Can you handle being woken up in the middle of the night? Are you able to spend several hours a week working on training and socialization? What about any other pets or people in your home? Will a puppy be too disruptive?</p><p>If you get a young puppy, be prepared to spend a lot of extra time with it, especially for the first few months. If this sounds like too much, but you still want a dog, consider adopting an adult dog.</p><h2>What Kind of Puppy Is Right for You?</h2><p>So you've weighed the pros and cons of puppy ownership and decided that the time is right for you to bring a puppy into your household. Congratulations! Now it's time to go look for your new little companion. But where do you begin?</p><p>First of all, decide what kind of puppy is right for you. Make a list of features or traits you must have, those you prefer, and those that you definitely do not want.</p><h2>Where to Find Your New Puppy</h2><p>Once you have gotten an idea of what type of puppy you want, its time to begin your search.</p><p>If possible, consider adopting a dog first. Mixed-breed dogs are absolutely wonderful and extremely underrated. Your local animal shelters and pet rescue groups have adorable mixed-breed puppies just waiting for homes. Even if you are not sure a mixed breed dog is for you, it's worth a trip to your local shelter or rescue group to meet some of the puppies. You might just fall in love!</p><p>You may truly have your heart set on a purebred dog. Many people have a favorite breed or need to know more accurately what to expect when the dog is grown. Factors like the size and coat type are very predictable in a purebred dog. Health concerns, temperament, and energy level are somewhat predictable but not guaranteed.</p><p>If you choose to buy a purebred dog, then you need to be responsible. Look for an experienced dog breeder with a stellar reputation. Avoid backyard breeders. Never buy from pet stores, as their dogs often come from puppy mills. Don't buy a dog from a flea market or a classified ad; these puppies have unknown backgrounds and may be unhealthy.</p><p>When you find the right puppy for you, it will just feel right. Most owners will tell you that their canine companions actually chose them, not the other way around!</p><h2>Puppy-Proof Your Home</h2><p>Before your little friend comes home with you, it's essential that you prepare your home. Do your best to puppy-proof every area of your home. Destructive puppy behavior is common, frustrating, and can be dangerous for your dog. Your puppy is sure to find all the little things that can hurt it.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>The best way to keep your puppy safe is to supervise it at all times. Keep your puppy in a crate while you are away (just avoid leaving for more than a few hours when your puppy is still young). A puppy should not have the full run of the house until it is older and well-trained.</p><h2>Stock up on Puppy Supplies</h2><p>You're going to need plenty of dog supplies before you bring home your new puppy. Start with the basics before you end up with a bunch of stuff you don't need such as toys your puppy doesn't enjoy or beds your puppy won't sleep in.</p><p>As your puppy grows, you will find you need other items, such as grooming supplies and preventive products. Your vet can help you decide which items best fit your dog's needs.</p><h2>Find the Right Veterinarian</h2><p>Your new puppy should visit your veterinarian for the first time within a few days of coming home with you. It is important for the puppy to have a physical examination, even if no vaccines are due. This is a chance to make sure there are no health problems that went undetected by the breeder, shelter, or rescue group.</p><p>It's best to find a good veterinarian before you bring home your puppy. Then you will have the vet lined up and not have to rush to find one. Look for a veterinary office with a great reputation in a convenient location for you. Make sure their prices are affordable for you. The best way to find a good vet is to ask around and research. Talk to friends and family members with pets. Look at online reviews. You might even want to go take a tour of the hospital and meet the staff to get a feel for the place.</p><p>On your puppy's first visit, be sure to bring all the paperwork provided by the breeder or adoption group. Your vet will do the examination and discuss the puppy vaccination schedule with you.</p><h2>Learn How to Raise Your Puppy Correctly</h2><p>If there is more than one person in your home who will interact with the puppy, set up the structure in advance. Who is responsible for feeding and walking the puppy and when? Make sure all parties agree on rules about where the puppy is allowed to go. Work together to make sure the training is consistent. If there are children in the home, make sure they know how to behave around dogs.</p>",1238

In most cases, tick bites are harmless, but some ticks carry serious diseases transmittable to your puppy. If a tick bites your puppy, but your puppy exhibits no symptoms, you don't necessarily need to visit your vet. But, if your puppy begins to show symptoms like fever, swollen lymph nodes, or limping after being exposed to a tick-ridden area, visit your vet for a diagnosis. If detected and treated early, you can quickly resolve illness from a tick bite. If left untreated, the results may be fatal. The best way to keep your puppy safe from tick bites is with preventative, anti-tick medication.</p><h2> What Are Tick Bites? </h2><p>Tick bites occur when a tick crawls onto an animal or human and sucks its blood. After being latched for several days, the tick's body will swell with blood and fall off. Typically, tick bites are not painful and can go unnoticed until symptoms appear. Most tick bites are benign and will only irritate the skin, but others cause diseases that, if untreated, can result in serious harm to your puppy. These diseases include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and tick paralysis.</p><p>There are more than 800 tick species worldwide, but only a few North American ticks will bite your pet. The American dog tick, the brown dog tick, the black-legged tick (deer tick), and the lone star tick are the most likely to harm your puppy.</p><h2> Symptoms of Tick Bites in Puppies </h2><p>If you can see an engorged tick on your puppy, it's safe to assume your puppy has been bitten. If the tick has fallen off before you notice it, you will have to wait on the development of symptoms to signal a tick bite has occurred. The symptoms of a tick bite in a puppy are shared with many other conditions, so be mindful of the context in which they occur. If your puppy has been in an area where ticks are prevalent, it's possible it has been bitten by a diseased tick. Symptoms typically don't appear until weeks or months after a bite.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3> Fever </h3><p>A diseased tick bite can cause a fever up to 105 F. Any diseased tick can transfer an infection that leads to fever. If you notice your puppy panting, shivering, experiencing lethargy, or other signs of discomfort, it might have a fever. Pay a visit to your vet to see if a tick bite is to blame.</p><h3> Swollen Lymph Nodes </h3><p>Swollen lymph nodes are symptomatic of many serious conditions in dogs, including a bite from a diseased tick. Look for swelling around your puppy's face and neck.</p><h3> Vomiting </h3><p>If your puppy begins to vomit following exposure to a tick-ridden area, it may have been bitten by a diseased tick. Vomiting, often accompanied by diarrhea, can be caused by a variety of illnesses, so take your puppy to the vet to receive a proper diagnosis.</p><h3> Limping and Lameness </h3><p>A bite from a diseased tick can cause limping or lameness in your puppy. Lyme disease, for example, often leads to joint inflammation, which affects your puppy's ability to walk comfortably. You may notice that your puppy's limp shifts between legs.</p><h3> Skin Irritation </h3><p>If a tick has bitten your puppy, it may scratch or itch at the bite site. Typically, tick bites are not itchy, so irritation around the bite site may be attributed to infection. Additionally, some redness may be caused by scratching or the bite itself.</p><h3> Enlarged Tick </h3><p>The most reliable sign of a tick bite is an enlarged tick attached to your puppy's skin. After a tick has bitten your puppy, it becomes engorged with the drawn blood. If the tick isn't engorged or is still crawling on your puppy, it likely hasn't bitten.</p><h2> Causes of Tick Bites </h2><p>Your puppy is at risk of being bitten by a tick if it has been exposed to a tick-ridden area.</p><h2> Diagnosing Tick Bites in Puppies </h2><p>If your puppy is not exhibiting symptoms of a diseased tick bite, it is usually not necessary to visit your vet for a diagnosis. However, if your puppy begins exhibiting symptoms following exposure to a tick-ridden area, see your vet. Your vet may run blood tests to check for antibodies caused by tick-borne illness. Lyme disease, caused by diseased tick bites, affects the kidneys, so your vet may run a urinalysis to determine the health of your puppy's organs.</p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>The improper removal of a tick can cause the spread of disease. If you see a tick on your puppy, use gloves to avoid exposure to diseased tick saliva. Blunt-nosed tweezers are best for removing embedded ticks from your puppy's skin. First, grasp the tick close to the puppy's skin and pull straight upward, gently and slowly. The goal is to remove the tick head along with the tick. If you pull off the tick but its head remains burrowed in your puppy's skin, you will have to monitor the area closely for any signs of infection. Be sure to place the tick in a substance like rubbing alcohol to kill it. Do not throw the tick into the trash or return it outdoors, as it can crawl and bite again.</p><p>Puppies that have been bitten by a tick won't always need treatment, but your vet may want to run additional diagnostics to determine if treatment is necessary. If your vet suspects disease, your puppy will likely be prescribed a month-long antibiotic. Some severe cases of tick-borne diseases can warrant hospitalization, but if detected and treated early, you can usually avoid this. If your puppy has been bitten, treat the bite site with an antiseptic to prevent skin infection after removing the tick.</p><h2> Prognosis for Puppies With Tick Bites </h2><p>Puppies tested and treated early after being bitten by a diseased tick will typically recover completely. The use of antibiotics is effective in resolving disease. If your puppy's diseased tick bite goes untreated, the effects can be lifelong or fatal.</p><h2> How to Prevent Tick Bites </h2><p>Using a vet-recommended flea and tick prevention on your dog year-round is essential in protecting your puppy from tick bites. These medications can kill ticks before they can transmit diseases. Ask your vet how best to protect your puppy, as age and preexisting health conditions influence the type of product you should choose.</p><p>It's also helpful to keep the grass in your yard short and keep your puppy away from tall grassed areas where ticks are prevalent. Clearing away vegetation in your yard that might contain tick-bearing rodents may also be helpful. In areas with high tick volume, treating the tick's habitat with pet-safe chemicals also helps reduce the pest population. Inside your home, vacuum and wash your puppy's bedding regularly.</p><p>It will probably take weeks or months before your puppy develops symptoms from a diseased tick bite. Once the symptoms appear, take your puppy to the vet right away.</p><p>Not all tick bites are harmful, but if you find a tick on your puppy, monitor it closely for symptoms. If your puppy doesn't exhibit any signs of illness, the tick bite was likely from a tick without disease, and further treatment isn't required.</p><p>If you suspect that your puppy is sick from a tick bite, your vet can perform a series of diagnostic tests. Usually, these tests will include blood analysis and a urinalysis to determine the presence of disease antibodies and the health of your puppy's kidneys.</p>",1249
89,https://www.thesprucepets.com/walking-puppy-when-its-too-hot-4082759,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Walking Your Puppy When It's Too Hot Outside</h1>,"<h1>Walking Your Puppy When It's Too Hot Outside</h1><h2>How to Make Sure Your Pup Gets Enough Exercise When The Weather is Hot</h2><p> Dr.</p><p>When summertime is in full swing, temperatures may consistently be over 90 degrees Fahrenheit with humidity in the 70s or 80s. This makes going outside a very arduous chore. But when you have a puppy, there are times when you are just going to have to go outside, most notably for bathroom times for your puppy and to get them some exercise.</p><p>When you and your puppy have to go outside for any time, make sure you go prepared. Here are some tips on how to get your puppy the exercise he needs when it is too hot to go outside.</p><h2> Choose the coolest parts of the day to take your puppy outside. </h2><p>When you need to take your puppy for bathroom time, the early morning, late afternoon, and evening are best for being able to spend more time out and about. Choosing these times will give your puppy the ability to stretch his legs a little more, and you won't have to worry about the sweltering heat quite as much. Of course, it can still be hot, so being prepared is still key.</p><h2> Offer your puppy water before going outside. </h2><p>As the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. And that is a pretty apt saying for this situation. If your puppy doesn't drink, then so be it. But always make sure to offer water. You can try teaching your puppy a cue word or phrase to drink water.</p><h2> Pack water if you are going to be outside for more than a few minutes. </h2><p>Sometimes you and your pup get distracted by the world around you, so it's good to come prepared. Try to grab a small bottle of water when you and your puppy go outside for a quick bathroom walk. If the quick bathroom break turns in to stroll around the block, you'll be ready to go. Bare minimum, you can make a bowl with one of you hands for your pup to drink from.</p><h2> If the sun is harsh, consider an umbrella. </h2><p>Perhaps it sounds a little ""Downton Abbey"" to carry a parasol for the sun, but you aren't wearing a fur coat. And the sun can actually be even worse if you have a hairless dog or one with extremely short hair! Carrying an umbrella offers a bit of shade that can really help keep your puppy cool in the midday sun. </p><h2> Sunscreen is best for some dogs. </h2><p>It may sound weird, but there are hairless dogs that will burn just as bad as any human if they don't have sun protection. Be aware of light colored and hairless places on your dog so they don't get sunburned. Just be sure to use a dog-safe sunscreen (avoiding ingredients like zinc oxide) and avoid getting sunscreen in their eyes. </p><h2> Keep in mind that asphalt is HOT in the summer. </h2><p>During summer, it can be dangerous to walking your dog across the blacktop of a parking lot or street. While dogs paw pads are stronger than the bottoms of our feet, they can still blister and burn, especially for inside dogs who spends most of their time on carpet and rugs. So, if you wouldn't want to walk across it, don't make your puppy do it. </p><p>When you need to take your puppy for bathroom time, early morning, late afternoon, and evening are best for being able to spend more time out and about. Try to stick to grassy or shaded areas.</p><h2> Try exercising your puppy indoors. </h2><p>Here are some good games to play with your puppy to help get their energy out while still enjoying the miracle of air-conditioning.</p><h2> Recall Games </h2><p>The simplest recall game to play is just a simple back and forth across a living room, hallway, or kitchen. This game require two people, and each person should have a handful of treats. One person gently restrains the puppy by the collar while the other person starts to call them. Don't immediately let go, but wait a half second to get the puppy a little more excited about going. Then, direct the puppy towards the other person. Once the puppy gets there, give him a treat, praise him, and prepare to send him back by repeating the process. Keep doing this for a few minutes at a time.</p><p>You can really up the ante on this game by using stairs, going around corners, and covering longer distances. If your puppy becomes disinterested in the game, go ahead and wrap up. This is supposed to be fun for everyone involved, so NEVER correct them when they come, even if they get distracted part way. Just be more interesting!</p><h2> Hide and Seek </h2><p>This is a recall game variation, but it is different enough to give it its own space. The great thing about this one is that you can play it with only one person. Simply wait until your puppy is distracted and sneak away (make sure you have a snack in your pocket). Make it easy the first few times until your puppy gets the idea. Hide just one room over and call your puppy. Stand behind a door. Hide behind the curtains or behind a couch or chair. Just be aware, if you hide in something like a cabinet or closet, your puppy may learn how to open these things! So be conscious of what unintentional training you may be doing while playing this game.</p><p>If you have more than one person, each person should hide and take turns calling the puppy once he has found one of you. If he is really good at this game, both people can call him and see who he finds first! Rewards and lots of praise make this a fun game to keep attention. </p><h2> Visit Pet-Friendly Stores </h2><p>Granted, this one requires going outside some to get there, but think about all the great things you can do once you are in the store! You can work on training that you've begun at home. Do ""sit-stays"" in front of the bone displays. Work on sitting and greeting people nicely when the store staff offers a treat. Practice ""come when called"" when your pup is distracted by that crafty low bucket of treats stores always have. Use ""leave it"" when they think that the ferret cage is the greatest invention you r dog has ever seen.</p><p>Make sure that your puppy is fully vaccinated, healthy, and ready to be in public spaces. Just be aware of safety, especially the heat of the parking lot when walking in. </p><h2> Have lots of fun and interactive toys for your puppy. </h2><p>Toys help make an enriching environment for your puppy and are great for days when playing outside is not very easy due to the heat. Provide a variety of fun and interactive toys for your puppy, and play together with your pup.</p><p>Keeping a puppy happy and exercised during the peak of summer can be challenging. But with a little time and creativity, you and your puppy will be worn out and satisfied in no time if you follow these easy tips!</p>",1203
90,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-dogs-jump-4063491,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Why Dogs Jump up and Down and How to Stop It</h1>,"<h1>Why Dogs Jump up and Down and How to Stop It</h1><p>Not only are dogs jumping on you generally annoying, but it can also be dangerous for people who aren't as steady on their feet. It can make people very mad at your dog. </p><p>Since dogs don't use the same language we do, they cannot communicate with us in the same way. So we have to look at their actions and behaviors as their method of communication. </p><h2> Dogs Jump to Say Hello </h2><p>If you have ever seen two dogs when they meet, they greet each other face to face, unless there is a massive size disparity. So, why are we surprised when that is how a dog wants to greet us? You come home from work and let your dog out, and they are excited to see you and excited to show you how much they have missed you. So they jump up on you to get closer and give you some love. </p><h2> How to Stop Dogs From Jumping to Say Hello </h2><p>To stop this type of jumping, you need to be consistent in your training approach and try to encourage all family members and visitors to follow your lead. Your dog will take its cues from your body language and how you start the interaction.  Consistency is key so making sure each greeting follows the same rules will help your dog to learn what is expected of it.</p><p>The most common way to train your dog not to jump when greeting you is to use a combination of positive reinforcement for the behavior you want, and to ignore the behavior you don't want, which is the jumping. When you come through the door, try to greet your dog calmly so as not to overexcite it. If your dog jumps on you, turn your back to it and ignore your dog until it sits or waits calmly. Some trainers even recommend exiting the room. When your dog stops jumping and is calm, then you reward your dog with praise, treats, and attention.</p><p>While your dog is learning this new routine, it can be helpful to keep your dog's leash on so you can quickly get control if your dog is too excited. Some trainers also recommend using a head harness type of leash which allows gentle control of the head without hurting the dog. This can be especially useful if you need to prevent your dog from jumping on particular people.</p><p>At first, you may need to practice this under the most relaxed circumstances. For example, this could be when you have just left the room momentarily, as opposed to after you have been gone for long periods of time or when there are a lot of people around. As your dog gets used to what is expected, you can start to increase the distractions and the level of excitement by practicing these techniques after longer separations and when more people are present. It will also help if your visitors and family members follow the same pattern so as not to create confusion for your pup.</p><p>You can teach your dog other specific cues to help your dog understand what you do and do not want it to do. Helpful cues may include ""sit"" ""snuggle,"" and even the ""go to your bed"" on command. The more cues your dog knows, the more you can communicate with your dog and help it understand what is expected and how to react under different circumstances.</p><p>If you want to teach your dog another way to show affection without jumping, a command such as ""snuggle"" or ""hug"" (or whatever term you choose) can be helpful. You can teach your dog that when you say that command and hold your hands down at its level, it can lean into your hands for pets and hugs. This way, your dog has another way to seek affection without jumping. In many cases, the praise and petting may be enough positive reinforcement for your dog to learn this cue and to start to do it on command. For some dogs, adding a treat to reward this behavior can provide even more motivation for it to follow the cue.</p><h2> Dogs Jump out of Fear </h2><p>If a dog is stressed or afraid, their demeanor and typical behaviors will change. If your dog starts jumping on you or certain people all of a sudden, it is worth taking note. Did something in their routine change? Can you identify certain triggers that happen right before your dog jumps? Does your dog show other signs of fear or anxiety such as separation anxiety when you leave, or fear of thunderstorms? Often anxious dogs will exhibit more than one behavior that is a sign of their anxieties but it can take time and patience to figure out what is setting your dog off.</p><h2> How to Stop Dogs From Fearful Jumping </h2><p>You may have a general idea that your dog is anxious based on other behaviors it shows, but if you need help figuring it all out, it can be very useful to work with an experienced dog trainer and/or veterinary behaviorist. They can help identify the triggers as well as to work with your dog on becoming desensitized to those fears.</p><p>Some techniques that they may suggest include giving your dog a safe space in your home, such as a crate or pen where your dog knows it can go when scared. Setting up a crate or pen as a safe space means it should be all positive associations; treats, toys, and other things your dog loves. Your dog should not be sent there as punishment or locked in, especially while you are establishing this. It can be a great tool to have when you know something fearful is going to happen and you need your dog to have a quiet place to retreat to.</p><p>If you can identify specific triggers, you can reduce your dog's fear in two main ways. The first way is to avoid those scary situations as much as possible to limit your dog's exposure to them. The second approach is to gradually try to desensitize your dog to its fear. This usually involves working in baby steps to get your dog comfortable with a fearful situation. A fearful dog should never be forced or intimidated into doing something scary. This can backfire by making your dog even more fearful, deteriorating the trust between you and your dog, and it can even lead to aggression if your dog feels desperate.</p><h2> Dogs Jump Due to Poor Social Skills </h2><p>Caring for a dog that was poorly socialized is a balancing act. It's about working with them slowly and patiently so they can experience new things, get used to living in your world, and minimize their fear and anxiety.</p><p>Dogs with poor social skills oftentimes just don't know better. They lack the communication tools most dogs have so they are unable to read body language and respond the way other dogs would. These dogs can come from any background, whether a rescue or a puppy from a great breeder; if they didn't spend their formative puppy time surrounded by other dogs and lots of different experiences, they may not know how to react to these situations.</p><h2> How to Stop Dogs With Poor Social Skills From Jumping </h2>",1213
91,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-body-language-2804578,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Body Language</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Body Language</h1><p>Even puppies use dog body language to ""talk"" to each other and their owners. Dogs are most highly attuned to body language and this silent communication imparts so many messages. Your pup's dedicated observation can make it appear psychic-it always hides when a bath is imminent-when in fact, it's simply reacting to non-verbal cues you may be unaware you're broadcasting. That's why if you smile as you reprimand your puppy for stealing your socks, it reads amusement rather than reproach, and acts accordingly. It becomes an expert at reading your behaviors and you can do the same for your pup.</p><p>Canine body language serves to smooth relationships, offering a way for dogs to get along with each other and the people who make up their families. Silent canine communication makes use of the dog's body from nose to tail. The position and movement of its tail, facial expression, even its posture is telling.</p><h2> Eye Talk </h2><p>Puppy eyes communicate volumes. Droopy eyelids indicate pleasure, and your pup may squint and moan with delight when its ears are rubbed.</p><p>Alert pups keep their eyes open wide. This may happen when they are worried or afraid.</p><p>An unblinking stare is a sign of assertiveness and/or aggression. While averting the eyes may be done to diffuse a conflict or may be a sign of nervousness.</p><p>The pupils of a dog's eyes may dilate widely when they are very fearful or agitated as their body is triggered into ""fight or flight mode."" This can occur with aggression as well. Avoid locking eyes with a strange dog. That can be interpreted as an assertive posture and may lead it to feel threatened, prompting it to challenge you back with aggression.</p><h2> Mouth Talk </h2><p>The dog's mouth is also quite expressive. Your pup uses its lips, teeth, and even its tongue to communicate.</p><p>In general, when the lips curl vertically to show the long dagger-shaped canines, the dog is showing assertiveness, which may stem from aggression or fear. Lips pull back horizontally to show more teeth in a canine grin of submission is often used as an appeasement gesture to signal that the dog is not a threat, and some dogs do this when they are happy or excited as well.</p><p>Grabbing the other dog's muzzle or neck with its mouth-with inhibited bite-is an assertive behavior and may be a warning sign of escalating aggression.</p><p>A flicking tongue signals intent to lick, which when aimed at the face or hands is also an appeasement gesture. The relaxed, happy pup may sit with its mouth half-open and tongue lolling out as it pants.</p><h2> Ear Talk </h2><p>The ears are barometers of puppy mood. The shape of the dog's ears-whether erect or floppy and pendulous-also influence how easy ear language is to understand. For the sake of this discussion, the ear conformation of the German Shepherd dog will be used.</p><p>When erect and facing forward, the dog is interested and alert. This posture may be used by dogs who are slightly nervous or fearful and are actively listening to their surroundings.</p><p>When the ears are lowered and stretch out to the sides, this may be a sign of nervousness, especially if accompanied by other signs consistent with worry, like lowering the eyebrows and whining.</p><p>If the ears flatten against the head and this is accompanied by a lowered head and neck position, with direct eye contact, lip-curling, or growling, it may be a sign of aggression.</p><h2> Tail Talk </h2><p>Tail talk is perhaps the dog's most obvious signal to people. Again, the conformation of the dog's tail-from long to docked, corkscrew, or curled-will determine the extent of your dog's tail semaphore.</p><p>Many people mistakenly assume that any wagging tail declares the dog to be friendly. However, what the tail says depends on its position and what the rest of the body is doing. A stiff raised tail with quick short wags can indicate the dog is very alert to something and may occur with feelings of excitement or aggression. A broad, loose, wag is more often associated with feeling happy and excited.</p><p>A lowered tail is often a sign of fear or submission.</p><h2> Body Position </h2><p>Your puppy's body carriage shows how it feels. Dogs bump, push, or lean against people or other animals as a way to communicate.</p><p>Erect posture is a sign of confidence typical of assertive dogs. They may seem to nearly stand on tiptoe when in the presence of another dog. The assertive dog leans forward toward whoever it wants to intimidate, while a more fearful dog leans backward in a submissive posture.</p><p>Dogs also stand or ""loom"" over top of another individual to assert their position. The more assertive dog will rest its head, chin, and/or paws over the neck or body of the more subordinate dog. Older dogs putting a puppy in his place may grab the muzzle or neck of the other pup to drive home its point and engage in mounting or clasping behavior.</p><p>The opposite is true when a dog shows submission. Puppies that feel insecure or are trying to diffuse a conflict will try to appear small and unthreatening. This may include flattening their ears, tucking their tails, crouching as low as possible, and perhaps offering a paw. Holding up a paw is a placating gesture as is rolling over to expose the tummy. Exposing the tummy, perhaps even urinating in this position or when crouched, is the dog's ultimate sign of deference.</p><h2> Fur Talk </h2><p>Piloerection-fur standing upright along the ridge of his back, called the hackles-makes the dog look bigger and more impressive. It's not a conscious thing and may happen simply when the dog becomes aroused. Raised hackles can mean serious business or can be a bluff. Both fearful and aggressive dogs raise their hackles and it can even occur during play.</p><h2> Just Kidding During Play </h2><p>Dogs may ""pretend"" to be aggressive to invite play, and indicate it's a game by using exaggerated behaviors before and after, called meta signals. Dogs also can ""pretend"" to be submissive to entice more subordinate playmates to engage in games. How puppies play involves a wide range of behaviors including over-doing it with exaggerated or inappropriate body language.</p><p>All these signals must be read together to place your dog's meaning in the proper context. Often, mixed signals may be sent, with the snarling front half of the dog indicating aggression while the back half wags submissively. In general, any sort of fearful or aggressive sign can prompt a bite and should be taken seriously.</p><p>Communicating submission to more assertive individuals helps each dog find a comfortable role in a group. Clear communication between dogs (and hopefully people) can help ensure that fights are rarely necessary. Well-socialized dogs use their body language to express themselves clearly and effectively so that they can seek out interactions that feel comfortable and safe and develop meaningful relationships. All of these tools make it possible for dogs to enjoy complex social interactions with other dogs as well as their favorite humans.</p>",1161
92,https://www.thesprucepets.com/stages-of-puppy-development-2804675,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Development From 6 Months to 1 Year</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Development From 6 Months to 1 Year</h1><p>During 6 months to 1 year of age, your puppy's physical changes will slow down a bit and their energy levels may increase showing you a newer side of your puppy's personality. At 6 months, your puppy is now considered an adolescent after their fast-growing juvenile stage from age 3 to 6 months.</p><p>Be prepared to adapt to your puppy's needs in this life stage since they may have several behavior changes that will need your reinforcement in training and patience. Remember to continue introducing your dog to different experiences with people and environments since they are still understanding the outside world.</p><h2> Physical Development </h2><h3> Growth </h3><p>By six months of age, your puppy's growth will slow down. Most small dog breeds will be nearly finished growing at this time, though they may continue to fill out over the next three to six months. Medium dogs often keep growing for a few more months, but at a slower rate. Large and giant dog breeds tend to keep growing until they are 12 to 24 months old. Between six and eight months, many puppies have a ""lanky"" and awkward look that is quite adorable.</p><h3> House Training </h3><p>Most dogs are house trained and in full control of their bladders and bowels by the age of six months. House training is mainly complete at this point. Some puppies will still have an occasional accident in the house, especially if there is a change in the routine. Continue to be patient and consistent; this is normal. If your dog is still having major issues with house training, contact your vet for advice. Your puppy may have a health issue that can be treated.</p><h3> Teeth </h3><p>Your puppy should have all of their adult teeth by six months of age. This means that teething is over and your dog may chew less obsessively. Remember that it is still normal for dogs to chew, so make sure you have healthy dog chews available.</p><h3> Sexual Maturity </h3><p>Dogs reach sexual maturity between 6 and 8 months of age. Pet owners should consider having their dog spayed or neutered by 6 months of age for small-breed dogs and between 9 and 15 months for large breed dogs, after growth stops.</p><p>If you have not neutered your male dog, he will begin to show an interest in female dogs, specifically those in heat. He will go to great lengths to mate at this point. Whether neutered or not, he will likely begin to lift his leg to urinate (if he hasn't already) and may begin marking areas with urine. Marking behavior can be curbed more easily if you stop it early. Catch your dog in the act and redirect him to an appropriate place. Marking behavior tends to be less severe in neutered dogs.</p><p>If your female dog has not been spayed, she will likely go into heat (estrus) between the ages of 6 and 8 months. She can easily become pregnant at this time if she is with a male dog. She may also try to escape the house to mate.</p><h2> Behaviorial Changes </h2><p>Your 6-month-old puppy is an adolescent now, and their behavior may show it. He may have an increase in energy and willfulness. The dynamic between other dogs may also change; adult dogs can now tell they are old enough to know better and will not go as easy on them if they step out of line.</p><h3> Socialization </h3><p>Just because your puppy is past the optimum socialization window, it doesn't mean that socialization should stop. Your puppy is still exploring his environment and learning new things. Continue to expose your puppy to new experiences, people, places, things, and sounds. Reward for calm behavior and ignore fearful behavior.</p><h3> Destructive Behavior </h3><p>It is common for adolescent puppies to exhibit some destructive behavior in this stage. This is often caused by boredom due to the increase in energy and confidence. Continue to provide plenty of exercise for your puppy.</p><h3> Training </h3><p>Puppies between 6 and 12 months of age may sometimes act like they ""forgot"" their training. Be consistent and firm. Continue to have regular training sessions, covering the old basics again, and mixing in newer, more difficult tasks.</p><h2> Health and Care </h2><p>Now that puppy vaccines are completed, your puppy will not need to see the veterinarian until adulthood (unless something is wrong). Be sure to watch your puppy for any signs of illness. Contact your vet with any concerns. You are still learning what is normal for your puppy. It is much easier to treat most health issues if they are caught early.</p><h2> Food and Nutrition </h2><p>Proper nutrition is an important part of your puppy's development. In general, you should continue feeding puppy food (dog food labeled for growth) until your puppy is done growing. Large breed dogs often need to stay on puppy food past their first year, but other dogs can usually start to transition to adult food between 9 and 12 months of age. Small breed dogs may transition even earlier.</p><p>Because your dog's rate of growth is slowing at this time, it can be easy to accidentally overfeed. Make sure your dog's growth is overall, not just in his belly. Obesity in dogs is a common problem. Ask your vet for advice about your dog's optimum weight. Your vet can also tell you when to transition your dog to adult food.</p><p>When feeding treats, make sure they are non-toxic, healthy, and not fed in excess. Dog treats should never make up more than 10 percent of your puppy's daily food intake.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>When giving chew treats, avoid bones, antlers, hooves, hard nylon dog toys, or other hard chews. Even though the adult teeth are all in, they can easily be damaged by chews that are too hard.</p><h2> Training </h2><p>You are never truly done training your puppy. Even adult dogs need regular training to keep them sharp. By this time, house training should be basically complete. Now is a good time to fine-tune obedience training. Continue to practice basic commands like sit, stay, and down. Add more advanced things, like roll over. Keep working on the recall cue and add in an emergency recall.</p><p>As your puppy matures, you may notice new behavior problems cropping up. Address them as soon as possible. Don't assume your puppy will grow out of it. The longer you allow inappropriate behavior, the more difficult it will be to correct it. If the issues are too hard to manage on your own, seek assistance from a dog trainer or behaviorist.</p>",1119
93,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppies-with-diarrhea-2804946,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Diarrhea in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>Diarrhea in Puppies</h1><p>Diarrhea can often be a sign of illness, caused by many different conditions. It's a common issue in puppies, but it can also potentially become serious if they get dehydrated or consumed anything inedible or dangerous. Although mild cases can be treated at home, more severe cases of diarrhea can be deadly for puppies and will need veterinary help. It's important for puppy owners to recognize serious symptoms and be familiar with dog diarrhea treatments, so they know how to proceed when their puppy is having diarrhea.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Don't wait to treat diarrhea-the resulting dehydration can make puppies even sicker. There are certain signs of diarrhea that require calling a veterinarian immediately, like waste looking black with a tar-like consistency, smelling extremely foul, containing large amounts of red blood, or being accompanied by symptoms like vomiting, severe abdominal pain, fever, appetite loss, or lethargy.</p><h2> Why Do Puppies Get Diarrhea? </h2><p>Diarrhea can be associated with viruses like parvovirus and distemper. It can also be caused by intestinal parasites like whipworms and hookworms, protozoa like giardia, and bacteria like salmonella and . Some types of intestinal parasites can require several tests (over weeks) to obtain a diagnosis. Puppies can also develop diarrhea from a sudden new environmental change, like abrupt changes in diet, the stress of coming to a new home, being overfed, or from indiscriminate eating (like out of the garbage or picking up items from outside).</p><h2> Viruses and Infections </h2><p>Puppies' immune systems are not fully developed when they are very young and haven't completed their full set of vaccines. This means they are generally more susceptible than adult dogs to bacterial or viral infections.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Both types of infection should be addressed immediately because they have the potential to be fatal. Common bacterial infections include salmonella and , but there are many other bacteria that can infect your pet.</p><p>Viral infections such as parvovirus and distemper, as well as coronavirus, can infect an unvaccinated puppy and cause diarrhea, and all are dangerous. If your puppy is suffering from an infection there's a good chance you'll see additional symptoms such as fever, lethargy, and/or lack of appetite.</p><h2> Parasites </h2><p>Puppies can acquire some intestinal parasites such as roundworms and giardia from their mothers very soon after birth. They can also pick them up from the ground or infected water while outside. Most common intestinal parasites can be treated with the right medications from your vet, but some, if not treated, can be dangerous to your pet's long-term health.</p><h2> Diet </h2><p>Puppies' digestive systems are still developing, and some puppies may have sensitive stomachs or have a hard time with particular brands or types of foods. Most will also respond poorly to a quick change in diet. A few have food allergies that can lead to diarrhea. Check with your vet to be sure the food you've selected is a good match for your puppy's needs; there are many different types of food available, and one will certainly be right for your pet.</p><p>In addition to having sensitive digestive systems, puppies are also curious and may mouth or ingest almost anything they find interesting. This can include string, garbage, or virtually anything they find on the ground. In some cases, this can be dangerous; certain objects can cause intestinal blockages while others can be toxic.</p><h2> Stress </h2><p>If your puppy has just been separated from its mother and siblings, chances are it's feeling some level of stress. Stress can be exacerbated by factors such as other pets in the house, unexpected sounds or smells, new foods, and new schedules. You can help your puppy overcome stress by providing a calm, predictable schedule, regular feedings and exercise, and plenty of affection.</p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>It's always best to get a vet check first, but he or she may recommend that milder forms of diarrhea be treated at home. For instance, if it's been less than three days, your puppy still feels and acts well, and the diarrhea has a pudding-like appearance, home care is usually appropriate.</p><p>Until you see the vet, however, withhold food (but never water) for 12 to 24 hours. This allows the gut to rest and gives the irritation a chance to heal. However, don't withhold food any longer than 24 hours without direction from your veterinarian.</p><p>Make sure that water is always available for your puppy, as it's very easy to quickly become dehydrated. Plus, sudden watery diarrhea can spill large amounts of fluid and important electrolytes out of the body. If your pet is reluctant to drink, offer ice cubes to lick. Pedialyte or Gatorade half diluted with water can counter the dehydration as well.</p><p>Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate may also help your pup. Use a needleless syringe or a turkey baster to squirt the medicine into his or her mouth. If appropriate for your pup's situation, your vet will know the proper dosage.</p><p>It usually takes a couple of days for your puppy's upset tummy to calm down, so a bland diet is suggested. Offer cooked plain white rice or plain, soft, cooked macaroni in a no-salt chicken broth. For more flavor, you can stir in a tablespoon of low-fat cottage cheese or plain yogurt. Yogurt contains beneficial bacteria that can help rebalance the disruption caused by diarrhea in your puppy. You can also try adding a little pumpkin flavor, as its high fiber content can assist with constipation or diarrhea, allowing the stool to normalize.</p><h2> Prevention </h2><p>The best thing you can do for your puppy is to make sure there is plenty of healthy and balanced food and exercise provided daily. New diets should be transitioned into slowly when puppies are young. It's possible that your puppy is getting into some spoiled food through the garbage can, so keeping those out of reach and being strict about not feeding your puppy any human food scraps is key. You will also want to stay current on your pup's vaccinations, and check for any lingering parasites.</p><p>When it comes to your puppy's environment, make sure that it's stress-free. If your puppy is in a kennel with other pets, you'll want to ensure that it's clean and disinfected. Puppies are sensitive to their surroundings, so it's helpful to stay on a regular routine for sleep, food, exercise, and walks. Another thing that can help is providing some weekly obedience training. On walks, you'll want to keep an eye out for any plant or puddle consumption, as feces can be present which can lead to diarrhea. When you're unable to supervise your puppy, you may want to keep it kenneled to prevent any accidents.</p>",1118
94,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-puppy-diseases-2805023,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>7 Common Puppy Diseases You Should Know</h1>,"<h1>7 Common Puppy Diseases You Should Know</h1><p>As much as you don't like to think about it, there are a few common puppy diseases that may strike your new little friend. When puppies get sick, it comes on quicker and takes them longer to get well than it does for adult dogs. That's why it's important to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms </p><p>When you know what to look for in a puppy's behavior you will have a better idea of what to do. Some things are an emergency while others may be able to wait until tomorrow before you call the vet.</p><h2>Parvo</h2><p>Parvovirus (commonly known as Parvo) most often affects young dogs that have not been vaccinated at all or have not completed their puppy vaccine series. Vaccination is the best way to prevent Parvo. Parvovirus is transmitted through dog-to-dog contact, infected feces, and contaminated surfaces in the environment. For this reason, it is recommended that unvaccinated dogs avoid walking on public streets or socializing with dogs of unknown vaccine status. Unfortunately, Parvo can be a very serious illness if contracted, and can be fatal.</p><p>The symptoms of Parvo include bloody diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy, and a loss of appetite. It's caused by a virus and sick puppies need to be seen by a vet as soon as possible so it can be treated with the right medications. It's likely that the puppy may need to be hospitalized as well. All breeds are at risk, but a few breeds that might be predisposed to Parvo include the Rottweiler, Doberman pinscher, and American Pit Bull Terrier.</p><h2>Distemper</h2><p>Nicole Tozier / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>Distemper also affects young puppies and other unvaccinated dogs. This virus is transmitted through airborne particles, contaminated surfaces in the environment, or contact with infected wildlife. It is a preventable disease if dogs are vaccinated appropriately but can be devastating if they get infected. This is another reason that dogs who have not completed their vaccine series should avoid contact with large groups of dogs as well as walking in public places. Sadly most cases are fatal and those that do recover may suffer permanent neurological damage.</p><p>Symptoms of Distemper include yellow-colored diarrhea, discharge from the eyes and nose, trouble breathing, weakness, neurologic signs and lethargy. Puppies may also have seizures or seem weaker or less coordinated than normal. Unfortunately, Distemper is often fatal, and prompt veterinary care should be sought.</p><h2>Kennel Cough</h2><p>Kennel cough is characterized by an aggravating honking cough and owners often describe it as sounding like something is 'stuck in their dog's throat'. It is caused by the bacteria and spreads through airborne particles. It's highly contagious and often contracted from highly populated dog areas like dog shows, kennels or even boarding your puppy during vacations. For this reason, most boarding facilities, groomers, and doggy daycares require dogs to be vaccinated against Kennel Cough to prevent outbreaks.</p><p>In most cases, if your dog gets Kennel Cough, the disease improves with supportive care. It can be difficult to distinguish from other respiratory diseases sometimes, so it is important to get any cough checked out by your veterinarian. If you suspect your dog has Kennel Cough, keep them away from other dogs and contact your veterinarian. Cough suppressants may be prescribed in severe cases to control persistent nonproductive coughing. Antibiotics are usually not needed except in severe cases. Most cases will resolve within a week or 10 days.</p><h2>Vomiting</h2><p>Vomiting can be a sign of many different illnesses. In a puppy, this may be more serious since they are smaller and more at risk for dehydration and low blood sugar. If your dog vomits, always contact your veterinarian and do not wait if they advise you to come in.</p><p>The causes of vomiting vary greatly from infections to parasites to intestinal blockages from eating foreign objects to systemic or congenital diseases. It can even happen if a dog eats too fast or gets motion sickness. Regardless, always reach out to your veterinarian who can help you determine what to do.</p><h2>Diarrhea</h2><p>Puppy diarrhea can be a symptom of serious disease but can also be a simple, common ailment in puppies. Diarrhea has many causes including more serious viruses like Distemper and Parvo, along with more common causes such as intestinal worms, or just eating the wrong thing (like getting in the garbage).</p><p>The key to knowing whether diarrhea is an emergency or not is to call your veterinarian. If a dog is acting normal and eating and drinking well, your vet may advise you on how to treat at home such as with a bland diet, in addition to submitting a fecal sample to check for intestinal parasites or worms. If a dog has decreased energy, poor appetite, or the diarrhea is not improving, then it is best to bring your pet in right away for an exam. You should also call the vet if your dog has any other symptoms like vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, or lethargy.</p><h2>Fleas</h2><p>Fleas carry disease and are uncomfortable for your dog. They can even cause anemia in dogs with severe infestations. Flea prevention that is recommended by your veterinarian should be given to your pet year round to help protect your pet from fleas. This applies to dogs that are mostly indoor or outside alot.</p><p>Scratching is the first sign that your puppy may have fleas. You'll also want to examine their fur for ""flea dirt"" which looks like black dandruff. If a dog is scratching excessively, best bring them in to the vet. Treating the environment in additional to treating each pet in the home is usually required to get rid of a flea infestation. All pets should be on a flea prevention as recommended by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Ticks</h2><p>Ticks are parasites that not only suck blood but also spread diseases. This is another common parasite that can be a big problem and ticks do not differentiate between puppies and full-grown dogs.</p><p>Using a tick prevention as recommended by your veterinarian is the best thing you can do to help prevent ticks from feeding on your dog and transmitting disease. It's a good idea to understand the life cycle of ticks, how to prevent them, vaccines that are available and ways to safely remove them from your puppy without exposing yourself to disease. If you live in an area with a lot of ticks or spend time in the woods with your dog, it is a good idea to learn how to check your dog daily for ticks. Ticks that are removed quickly are much less likely to transmit disease.</p>",1086
95,https://www.thesprucepets.com/demodex-what-is-mange-2804926,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Demodectic Mange in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>Demodectic Mange in Puppies</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Demodectic mange, also called red mange, demodex, or demodicosis, is a skin disease caused by a cigar-shaped microscopic mite that is a normal inhabitant of canine skin and found on most healthy dogs. The mite infests hair follicles and occasionally the sebaceous glands of the skin. In dogs with healthy immune systems, the body can naturally manage the number of mites on the skin. However, demodectic mange typically occurs when a dog's immune system is suppressed, allowing the mites to present in excess numbers that cause hair loss on the face or the dog's body. This disease is not contagious to other dogs, but instead, it occurs in dogs with genetic defects that weaken the immune system. Demodectic mange should be treated as soon as possible to prevent the disease from spreading to more areas of the body. If you suspect that your puppy has demodectic mange, consult your veterinarian to begin diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.</p><h2> What Is Demodectic Mange? </h2><p>Demodectic mange is the most common form of mange in dogs, occurring when mites that normally live on the skin of most dogs are able to grow in excess numbers because the dog has a suppressed immune system.</p><p>Mange is a generic term that describes a hair loss condition caused by microscopic parasites (called mites) that live on or under the skin. Mites are similar to insects, but they are more closely related to spiders. The life cycle of the mite is spent entirely in the host animal and takes about 20 to 35 days to complete. Spindle-shaped eggs hatch into small, six-legged larvae, which molt into eight-legged nymphs, and then into eight-legged adults.</p><p>For instance, canine scabies is another type of mange mite in dogs. Ear mites are another parasite that lives inside the ear canal. Mange is caused by a wide variety of mites, and depending on the mite involved, skin disease can be mild to severe. It may resemble some types of skin allergies.</p><h2> Symptoms of Demodectic Mange in Puppies </h2><p>Demodectic mange is always characterized by symptoms of hair loss, but this may be localized or generalized depending on the condition's progression and severity. Puppies are usually affected before reaching 18 months of age.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3> Mild Facial Hair Loss (Localized Disease) </h3><p>Demodectic mange begins as a localized disease that is limited to a spot or two on the face and around the eyes. It may also present in small patches on the legs. Localized demodicosis is quite common in puppies, and it is usually a mild disease that goes away by itself or with the use of topical treatments. It typically consists of one to five small, circular, red, and scaly areas of hair loss around the eyes and lips, or on the forelegs. The affected areas may or may not be itchy, and skin infections can occur alongside this disease that require additional treatment.</p><p>In most cases, the localized form resolves as the dog's immune system matures and gets the mites under control. It rarely recurs. An adult-onset disease is considered rare, and when it does occur, it usually is a result of compromised immunity associated with other systemic diseases.</p><h3> Severe Bodily Hair Loss (Generalized Disease) </h3><p>When the localized form spreads, involving large areas of the body with severe disease, it is considered generalized. Generalized demodicosis is a severe disease characterized by massive patchy or generalized hair loss and skin inflammation, often complicated by skin infections that may cause ulcers, swelling, and fever that require antibiotics to treat.</p><p>Mites (all stages) may also be found in lymph nodes, intestinal wall, blood, spleen, liver, kidney, bladder, lung, urine, and feces. The skin is red, crusty, and warm, and has many pustules. It bleeds easily, becomes very tender, and has a strong ""mousy"" odor due to bacterial infection on the skin. When infection is present, an immediate visit to the veterinarian is necessary to begin antibiotic treatment.</p><h2> Causes of Demodectic Mange </h2><p>Demodectic mange typically affects puppies, but it can also affect adult and senior dogs for non-genetic reasons. In any case, immune-compromised individuals are unable to stop mite proliferation.</p><h2> Diagnosing Demodectic Mange in Puppies </h2><p>If your puppy is showing signs of demodectic mange, your veterinarian will diagnose the disease by taking skin scrapings or biopsies that will be examined under a microscope in the laboratory. Since these mites live on most dogs, the diagnosis will be confirmed based on the number of mites inhabiting your dog's skin. Once demodectic mange is detected, your veterinarian can begin discussing treatment options based on the severity of the condition.</p><h2> Treatment &amp; Prevention </h2><p>Occasionally, treatment is not necessary for localized demodicosis, which may clear up by itself as puppies grow and develop stronger immune systems. Treatment may also include topical medication as necessary. However, generalized demodicosis requires aggressive therapy. Pet owners should prepare for a lengthy process to aid in recovery.</p><p>Puppies with generalized demodectic mange are typically treated with whole-body dips and specialized shampoos. These dips contain an insecticide that can sometimes lead to serious side effects for puppies and their owners who come in contact with them, but most dogs experience fewer problems as treatments continue and their natural tolerance to the medication is increased. These side effects can include drowsiness, vomiting, lethargy, and drunken behavior. Products for the treatment of demodectic mange should only be used with veterinary supervision.</p><p>Antibiotic therapy is required to fight any secondary skin infections that develop. Regular baths with exfoliating shampoos such as those containing benzoyl peroxide are helpful.</p><p>Since demodectic mange is usually an inherited condition, this disease cannot typically be prevented. However, older dogs with weakened immune systems may respond to immune-boosting options that can decrease their likelihood of developing it. Your veterinarian may recommend a specialized diet or nutritional supplements to strengthen your dog's immune system when they see demodectic mange as a risk.</p><h2> Prognosis for Puppies With Demodectic Mange </h2><p>The weakened immune system that leads to demodectic mange can make treatment and recovery difficult, so owners should prepare for continuous treatment and possible relapses. Localized demodectic mange can usually be treated successfully, but puppies may have issues until their immune system is fully developed around the age of 18 months old. Generalized demodectic mange, on the other hand, may require lifelong treatments and check-ups with your veterinarian.</p>",1067
96,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-leash-train-a-puppy-2805075,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Leash Train Your Puppy</h1>,"<h1>How to Leash Train Your Puppy</h1><p>Leash laws may require your puppy to walk nicely on a leash and know how to heel when off your property. But, even if they don't, it's simply polite puppy behavior to know leash etiquette. With proper leash manners, your dog has more freedom to safely explore the world beyond your front or backyard.</p><p>Large breed puppies can grow into powerful, tugging tanks that can pull the leash from your hands or drag you all over. That can be dangerous for you if you're bowled over and dangerous for them if they run into traffic, become tangled far beyond your reach, or get into a fracas with another dog. Even friendly puppies can get scared and a leash provides security and a comfort level when a trusted owner offers guidance through a crowd of strangers or scary situations.</p><p>Puppies do not instinctively know how to walk on a leash. When you pull, dogs instinctively pull back, and if you allow the pup to win, that can make it even more difficult for them to overcome the urge to do it.</p><p>It is much easier to teach a small puppy than a powerful adolescent or adult. If you have a puppy, then now is the perfect time to teach it to walk nicely on a leash. Begin immediately when you bring the pup home.</p><h2> Start With a Collar </h2><p>Many purebred puppies wear temporary collars (or color-coded ribbons) from birth to help identify them from littermates. But if a collar is new to your puppy, give the dog some time to get used to it. A flat, nylon collar with a metal buckle and space so you can fit two fingers beneath is ideal. You very likely will need to get larger ones as the pup grows, so inexpensive ones at first work fine.</p><h2> Harness a Pulling Dog </h2><p>For powerful pups that might be tempted to pull you down the street, use a no-pull harness. These training tools work especially well for older, hard-headed pups because it trains them not to pull. The leash hooks to a clip on the front of the dog's chest so that when the dog pulls, the harness turns the dog back toward the person holding the leash. This effectively trains the dog not to pull.</p><h2> Engage Your Dog's Sense of Smell </h2><p>Before attaching a leash or putting on the harness for the first time, encourage your pup to sniff them. Smell is an important way for puppies to communicate; a good sniffing is important. But al leash is not a toy, so don't allow the dog to chew or play tug with the leash.</p><h2> Get the Right-Sized Leash </h2><p>Choose an appropriate style of a leash for the size of your puppy. Light-weight nylon leashes work well for small pets while heavier leather leashes may be more appropriate for larger pups. It is a good idea to pass on the urge to get a retractable leash. These leashes can teach pups to pull as they reward jumping up, although these may be fine for toy-sized dogs. A 6-foot length typically gives puppies sufficient freedom without owners losing control.</p><p>At this point, just aim for your pup to not surge ahead, drag, or pull, but simply to walk nicely on either side on a loose (not tight) leash. If you keep the leash tight, the dog will naturally pull against it, so avoid tugging or trying to drag. Hold the leash in your right hand, doubling up the extra slack so it doesn't drag, and hold that right hand at your belt buckle level.</p><h2> Reward Good Behavior </h2><p>Have treats or favorite toys or other rewards (a sniff of something stinky for nosy pups) and dole it out with your free hand. You may also wish to use clicker training to communicate with your puppy.</p><p>Show your pup a treat while the dog sits or stands at your side. If you plan to eventually compete in obedience trials or other dog sports, it's traditional to have the dog walk on your left side. But if you don't care about competition, it doesn't matter which side as long as you're consistent.</p><p>Wait until the puppy focuses on the reward. Then say, ""Let's go!"" or another verbal cue that you use consistently. You must know how to talk to a puppy in a manner it understands. Hold the treat right in front of its nose as you begin to walk, luring the dog to keep pace.</p><h2> Practice Walking </h2><p>After the puppy understands the concept of loose-leash walking and sitting on command, you might want to change up the speeds. You will want your dog to maintain the pace you're going and stay at your side, whether you walk, trot, or run. Also, practice changing directions. When your pup walks on the left, a turn to your right or an about-face to the right should be pretty easy for the dog to follow. Turning to the left may require luring with the reward at least initially. Turn it into a game so that once the pup understands, you can give praise extravagantly.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>""Proofing"" a behavior means ensuring that your dog will stick with the behavior even in challenging situations. To proof your dog's ability to walk well on a leash, move the practice times to areas that have more distractions. After all, leaving your backyard or living room will be necessary when you go to the park, or take a car ride to visit friends and family, and you want loose leash walking to be a default behavior wherever you go. For instance, you should practice in the front yard during morning rush hour or when your spouse tosses a ball on the other side of the room.</p><p>As your dog develops more skills, you can start to teach it to ""heel."" The ""heel"" position is walking alongside you on your left side at knee-level while stopping and starting when you do, and sitting when you stop. Once your pup pays attention to the ""let's go"" command and anticipates the ""sit"" command when you stop, you might want to try getting your dog to heel around the entire perimeter of the yard or do laps outside the house.</p><p>Even the smartest dogs can have trouble sticking with a behavior, and you will probably need to reinforce some of the training you've done, helping your pet to learn behaviors and overcome common challenges without immediate rewards.</p>",1082
97,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-separation-anxiety-2804584,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Separation Anxiety in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>Separation Anxiety in Puppies</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>If you notice your puppy exhibiting anxious behaviors like excessive vocalizing, distress as you prepare to leave the house, or destruction of items while you're gone, your puppy may be experiencing separation anxiety. Puppy separation anxiety is common and successfully treatable with a combination of desensitizing behavior training and medication. Puppies adopted before eight weeks of age, mixed breeds, and puppies adopted from shelters are at the highest risk. Be careful not to confuse normal puppy behavior with a separation anxiety disorder. Showing your vet a video of your puppy taken when they are left home alone is the best way to reach a diagnosis.</p><h2> What Is Separation Anxiety? </h2><p>Separation anxiety in puppies occurs when your dog exhibits significant distress in response to being left alone. Affected puppies will typically feel over-attachment to one or more family members and are easily upset by their comings and goings. Behavior symptomatic of separation anxiety is often triggered by a change in routines, such as more time spent away from home because of a new job, a new dog introduction, or a new baby, which can cause your puppy stress. Problems develop when the amount of time you spend with your puppy changes. </p><p>Animal behaviorists are careful to distinguish between separation behaviors and separation anxiety. Just because your puppy is acting out when left alone doesn't mean that it is because they are suffering from separation anxiety. It is normal for your puppy to whine as you leave the house or miss you while you're gone. Separation anxiety is far more severe and can be debilitating for your puppy.</p><h2> Symptoms of Separation Anxiety in Puppies </h2><p>It's important to closely examine your puppy's behavior to determine whether it is suffering from separation anxiety or is displaying typical, expected puppy behaviors.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3> Distress </h3><p>If your puppy has separation anxiety, it may follow you around the house and become increasingly upset as you prepare to leave. Your puppy may excessively whimper, shake, or pace as it sees you pick up your keys or put on your coat.</p><h3> Excessive Vocalization </h3><p>Excessive whining, howling, or barking can indicate your puppy is experiencing separation anxiety. Extreme vocalizations will sometimes last up to 15 minutes after being left alone, but your puppy may be able to calm down after some time.</p><h3> House Training Accidents </h3><p>Some puppies may have accidents caused by the stress of separation anxiety, but it's important to consider other factors before deeming an accident a symptom. While a symptom of separation anxiety, it is normal for all puppies to have accidents. House-trained dogs older than nine months can hold their bladder for up to 8 hours, but younger puppies cannot.</p><h3> Destruction of Personal Items </h3><p>Many puppies with separation anxiety will try to destroy your belongings. This destruction isn't retaliation for being left alone, but rather, because these items smell like you, your puppy's anxiety might be triggered, prompting displacement behaviors. Puppies may also seek out objects that smell like you because your scent comforts them. Some behaviorists suggest that separation behaviors such as emptying your sock drawer or chewing up toilet paper may arise out of boredom and not separation anxiety. Be sure to observe your puppy closely to draw the critical distinction.</p><h2> Causes of Separation Anxiety </h2><p>Separation anxiety in puppies has several explanations, some clearer than others.</p><h2> Diagnosing Separation Anxiety in Puppies </h2><p>To diagnose your puppy with separation anxiety, observe its symptoms closely and consult with your vet for an expert opinion. Your vet may ask that you set up a video camera to film your pet while you're away and bring in the footage to examine your puppy's solo behavior.</p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>Puppies should never be punished for any anxiety-based behavior, as punishment will usually make the issue worse. If your puppy exhibits destructive separation behaviors, you can take measured steps to reduce the problem.</p><p>Desensitizing your puppy to your leaving/absence is key to improving anxious behaviors. For example, pick up your car keys 50 times-but then don't leave. Put on your coat or open the door a dozen times, then stay inside. Repetition of these cues makes them less meaningful, so the puppy will be calmer when you actually leave. Building your puppy's tolerance to your absence incrementally may also be helpful. You can try going for one minute at a time, and then two minutes, three, etc.</p><p>You can make sure your puppy is tired from exercise before you leave the house to minimize the energy it takes for it to destroy while you're gone.</p><p>Your veterinarian may prescribe drug therapy that relieves the anxiety, such as Clomacalm (clomipramine hydrochloride) or Reconcile (Prozac or fluoxetine), but drugs alone don't always cure the anxiety.</p><h2> Prognosis for Puppies With Separation Anxiety </h2><p>Following a diagnosis by your vet, your puppy will likely respond well to a combination of desensitizing techniques and medication to treat separation anxiety.</p><h2> How to Prevent Separation Anxiety </h2><p>You can do many things to help prevent your puppy from developing separation anxiety. It is important to aim for stability in your puppy's routine and the duration and frequency with which you leave your puppy alone, as instability can prompt anxiety. In maintaining this routine, you should avoid leaving your puppy alone for too long, but also avoid long uninterrupted periods without leaving your puppy. If possible, striking a balance between the two helps prevent separation anxiety. </p><p>Additionally, exposing your puppy to extensive socialization outside of the home in the first five to 10 months of age will reduce the chance of developing separation anxiety.</p><p>While not uncommon, separation anxiety in puppies is not normal. There is a difference between your puppy exhibiting behaviors typical of an untrained dog and symptoms of a severe anxiety disorder. It's sometimes difficult to distinguish the two, but your vet will make a proper diagnosis.</p><p>Your vet may ask you to set up a video camera to record your puppy's behavior while you're away to show at an appointment. The video (and audio) will provide insight into behaviors like the duration of vocalizations or if your puppy is pacing or shaking.</p>",1074

These juvenile delinquent dogs haven't learned how to control their excitement and can bruise, scratch or knockdown owners when they launch themselves and plow into you with their paws and claws. With small dogs and young pups, these tips to stop jumping up can work.</p><p>When your puppy reaches adolescence, he may be unable to control his impulses and start to test limits (just like a human child). Adolescent jumping up can turn into ""nose boinking"" which can lead to broken glasses or even a bloody nose. Jumping up often combines with mouthing behavior where the pup bites and grabs your hands, clothing or even your derriere in a grabbing game of tag.</p><p>In most cases, a puppy doesn't mean to be bad and it's simply how he plays. These puppy jumping tips can solve problems with young dogs. When you've got a hard-core juvenile delinquent, a new approach can help. Each dog is different so not all work with every pup. Here are 10 tried and true tips from some dog behavior consultants and trainers colleagues to help cool your puppy's jets.</p><h2> Keep It Low Key </h2><p>Homecomings and departures are a prime time for jumping up because puppies want to greet you or stop you from leaving. Turning your back on some of these dogs revs them up even more, so instead, try ignoring the bad behavior. ""Ignore"" means you make no eye contact, say nothing and stand still like a zombie offering no reaction to silly puppy behavior.</p><h2> Dance Your Dog </h2><p>When your puppy jumps up, grab her front paws and dance her around the room. Some pups hate this so much that's incentive enough to stop jumping. However, with other pups that enjoy the dance, it could reward the behavior. If this causes more intense mouthing and biting of your hands, try a different tip.</p><h2> Play a Game </h2><p>Teach your puppy a conflicting behavior such as ""fetch your ball."" She can't jump up if she's running to bring you her ball or favorite toy. Just the name of a special game or toy-""go get your bear!""-can change the dog's focus and redirect the behavior long enough for you to evade the jumping. With enough repetition, your puppy will begin to associate your home-coming with ""go fetch"" instead of jumping up.</p><h3>How to Train Your Dog to Fetch</h3><h2> Hide a Toy </h2><p>For pups that ambush you and bite your rear end while playing outside, hide a toy or two in the backyard and ask them to find the toy. Bad weather can give puppies cabin fever when they don't have adequate time outside to run off the energy. Mental stimulation can wear them out, too. Show your puppy a favorite toy and then roll it up inside an old towel and knot it to make a puzzle. Encourage the pup to unravel and get the toy. You can even tie the first toy-in-the-towel inside a second one for more of a challenge to relieve boredom.</p><h2> Practice Commands </h2><p>A conflicting behavior when you come home-like ""sit""-helps enormously. You'll need to practice your puppy's ""sit"" during calm moments first, and then ask for this polite behavior before you leave and when you arrive home. Guests will appreciate a polite ""sit"" when they arrive, too, as they won't appreciate your puppy leaping around and mugging them for attention.</p><h2> Cry and Yelp </h2><p>Many puppies don't know their strength. When they jump up and you wave your arms and try to push them off, they may think it's a game and grabs and bite harder. Tell them it hurts the same way another puppy would, with a YELP! Lay it on thick, overact and cry and sob like the pup has done major damage. Some tough dogs get the message using this. For the out-of-control grabby, ambush type of dog play, give him a taste of his own medicine and SCREAM (very loud but very short), and fall over ""dead."" Don't move and don't say anything. Play dead for at least 15 to 20 seconds. The shock value may be enough to send a permanent message that such games stop all interaction, plus they hurt you-and playing dogs aren't interested in hurting you and won't want you to cry.</p><h2> Body Block Nose Pokes </h2><p>An anxious or playful pup may leap high quickly and suddenly ""poke"" at your face with their nose. That can be triggered by leaning over the top of them especially when they're in a high-arousal situation like a homecoming or around other dogs. It may be a way for stressed pups to relieve their anxiety, so be aware of situations that cause these behaviors. Dogs control each others' movement with their body language. Think how a Border Collie makes sheep move just by getting close. You can stop your pup's jumps by stepping close to him just before he leaps. Cross your arms and step into the pup's personal space before he crouches to leap.</p><h2> Use a Drag-Line </h2><p>This is a long leash that the pup can ""drag"" along the ground. When the pup approaches, simply step on the line before he can jump which prevents him from leaping. While you step on the line, don't make eye contact or give him attention until he stops trying to jump.</p><h2> Employ a Tie-Down </h2><p>With a tie-down, you simply attach your dragline to a fixed object like a fence, stair rail or another immovable object like an eye-bolt in the wall. This exercise uses the same principles as teaching the ""wait"" command, only instead of closing a door or gate, the pup is confined by the leash. That keeps you safe from mouthing and claws and prevents the pup from jumping up and grabbing. Practice puppy sits and downs while you stay out of range. Only reward the puppy with contact from you when he stays calm with all four feet on the floor.</p><h2> Recruit Help </h2><p>Practice the tie-down exercise with several friends. Have them approach, one after another, and only pet the pup if he doesn't jump. If he tries to leap, back out of range and say, ""Too bad!"" or something similar. Repeat the exercise 10 to 20 times in a row, and the pup will learn the lesson.</p>",1069

Dogs, however, overheat much more easily and quickly than humans do. They have much fewer sweat glands and rely on panting to keep cool.</p><p>Young puppies can be at even greater risk of heatstroke. They don't have the ability to regulate their temperature the way an adult dog can; breeds with temperature-regulating double coats won't have developed their adult coat yet; and they are, of course, full of energy. It can be a particular problem for brachycephalic breed puppies such as pugs and French bulldogs, as their flat face shape makes their panting less effective.</p><p>So, it's up to the caretaker to keep them safe and comfortable on hot summer days. Letting your puppy chill inside in the air conditioning is one option for keeping it cool. But, for puppies that enjoy spending time outdoors, owners need to create an environment conducive to staying cool.</p><p>Check out these tips for keeping your puppy cool in the summer.</p><h2> Provide Shade </h2><p>If you spend a lot of time in the yard with your puppy, it is important that they have access to shade. If you don't have a shade tree, an outdoor patio umbrella or sunshade canopy will work just as well. Puppies can also find shelter in a ventilated dog crate or doghouse with ample airflow.</p><p>Even lying in a shaded area, your pup could still be at risk of heat exhaustion when the temperatures are very high. In these instances, it is best to bring them indoors to an area where cool air is circulating.</p><h2> Offer Cool Drinks </h2><p>Cold water aids in the evaporative process that happens when a dog pants. It's one of the main ways that dogs of all ages regulate their temperature. A dehydrated puppy will develop heatstroke more quickly.</p><p>Cool and clean water should always be available. If your pup doesn't drink a lot, you could add it to their food. If you are out on a walk, make sure you bring water with you.</p><p>Be aware that playful puppies may tip over the water bowl. To avoid this mishap, dig a hole in the ground and fit a shallow watering pail inside. This way, your puppy can't tip it over. The surrounding soil also helps insulate the water, keeping it cooler for longer.</p><h2> Freeze a Treat </h2><p>Fill your puppy's favorite rubber chew toy with soft food blended with chicken broth or water. Then, stick it in the freezer. Offer these ""pupsicle"" treats to help your dog stay cool. You can make cool treats for hot pups with yogurt concoctions and baby food, too. And, chilled treats also alleviate the pains of teething and are great for mental enrichment and keeping your pup occupied.</p><h2> Get Misty </h2><p>Misting fans made especially for pets spew water into the air and lower your puppy's body temperature by keeping their fur damp. As the water evaporates, it cools your pup off. Misters can be placed on the porch, on the deck, or near a puppy playpen. Make sure the area you're misting has a grass, wood, or concrete surface. Watering bare ground can create a muddy mess.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>A light mister is a much safer option than soaking your puppy with a fast-running hose. Although some dogs love to catch the hose water in their mouth, drinking large quantities of water too quickly can lead to what is called water intoxication. Although rare, in extreme cases it can be fatal.</p><h2> Host a Pool Party </h2><p>Set up a kiddie wading pool for your puppy's splashing pleasure. A molded plastic version will be more durable against sharp claws than an inflatable variety. Place it in the shade and invite a few doggie friends over. Use floating dog toys and let your puppy learn water sports from the older dogs. To assure safety, keep the water level low, always supervise, and make sure your pup can climb out easily.</p><h2> Dig a Dugout </h2><p>Create a sandbox in a shaded corner of the yard for your puppy to stay cool. Puppies that love to dig might even excavate their own spot. Wet down the sand so that they can scoop out a comfy and cooling nest during the heat of the day.</p><h2> Enlist Cooling Technology </h2><p>The same technology used to keep athletes cool and comfortable during hot weather also works for pets. You can find a variety of cooling products including bandanas, collars, jackets, beds, and mats for indoor or outdoor use. Just soak them in water for evaporative cooling that lasts up to five hours. </p><p>If you don't want to invest in cooling products, you could soak a towel for your pup to lie on.</p><h2> Exercise at Dawn and Dusk </h2><p>For puppies used to daily walks, when the temperatures soar, walking in the middle of the day is not recommended. The risk of heat exhaustion is real and you will also have to watch out for the tarmac being so hot that it could burn your pup's delicate paw pads.</p><p>Heading out at dawn and dusk when the temperatures are much less extreme is best. Walks should be short, slow, and calm-steer clear of vigorous games like fetch.</p><h2> Keep Your Home Cool </h2><p>Even indoors, your pup could be at risk of overheating, especially if you don't have AC. Consider purchasing a fan that can be placed in the room that your puppy sleeps in and close the drapes in bright rooms.</p><h2> Select an Appropriate Bed </h2><p>It can be tempting to opt for a cozy, squishy, high-sided, fleecy bed for your puppy. In hot weather, however, a bed like that will likely be too hot. Offering your puppy the choice of a cooler sleeping spot is recommended. Raised beds that are elevated from the floor allow better airflow.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>One of the most common reasons for puppies developing heatstroke is when they are left in a car on a hot day. Even if you are only planning to quickly stop off for a few groceries, you will be putting your pup at risk leaving them in the car while you do so. In just a matter of minutes, cars can reach dangerously high temperatures and it just isn't worth the risk.</p>",1041
100,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-aggression-why-dogs-fight-2804576,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Stop Puppies From Fighting</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Puppies From Fighting</h1><p>Puppies, especially litter mates, play fight a lot. There's little more adorable than watching a group of puppies tussle with each other, but how can you know when the wrestling stops being playful and starts to become a true fight, though? What can you do if you have one puppy in particular that continues to take play time a little too far?</p><h2> Why Do Puppies Fight? </h2><p>Puppies learn normal social behavior, what is acceptable and okay and what is not, from interacting with other puppies. This starts even before puppies are weaned from their mother. Healthy play allows a pup to not only build a good foundation of socialization but it also helps them learn body language and other nonverbal behavioral cues. What they learn as puppies in regards to normal dog-on-dog behavior sets the ground work for skills they will utilize throughout their life.</p><h2> What is Healthy Play and What is a True Fight? </h2><p>Being able to read body language and behavioral cues yourself is of utmost importance in order to differentiate puppy play from puppy fighting. Puppies that are engaged in healthy, happy play will be loose, having bounding, bouncy, sometimes exaggerated movements with a big, silly, open mouth. You may see the stereotypical play bow and you may hear loud and/or continuous growling. Healthy play between puppies has no winners or losers. Instead, there are constant role reversals where you may see the chaser become the chasee only to become the chaser again. In addition, when puppies are exhibiting healthy play you may see one pup 'self-handicap' him or herself by laying on their side or back or crouching down lower (if they are playing with a smaller puppy). You will also see puppies taking breaks from healthy play. Two puppies may be tussling on the ground one second and then getting up to go get a drink of water the next second.</p><p>Puppies that are engaged in a fight will have markedly different behavioral cues and body language. Instead of loose, bounding movements they will become stiff and tense. You may even see their hackles raise up. Instead of a happy, open mouthed, tongue lolling face, they will tight lipped with either a snarl or a low, quiet growl. The ears will become flat and pinned back.</p><p>If you happen to catch your puppy in a fight you want to separate the puppies as quickly and safely as possible. If your puppy has their leash and harness on them this usually can be done without much difficulty. Of course, most puppies don't play with their leashes attached to them all the time. As much as you are tempted to do so, do not reach out for your puppy's scruff or try to get in between your puppy and the other one. You may get injured in the process. Instead, redirect them with other toys or try to momentarily distract the puppies with a loud noise, such as whistle or clap. From there, if your puppy has a well-trained recall already, you can call him/her over to you or you can simply clip his/her leash on and lead them away from the other puppy.</p><h2> How to Prevent Puppies from Fighting </h2><p>Puppies that are routinely getting into fights with other puppies may need more enrichment outside of puppy social hour. Dogs can learn behavioral cues (sometimes referred to as commands) as early as seven to eight weeks of age, so enrolling in puppy classes as close to eight weeks old as possible and continuing through adolescence can provide your puppy with the mental stimulation he/she needs to stave off boredom. It also provides foundation skills (like that simple recall) for controlling your puppy's behavior as well as helping you to better understand what normal puppy/dog behavior is and what normal puppy/dog communication is.</p><p>Finding a trainer is sometimes easier said than done. Unlike the world of veterinary medicine, the world of dog training is not regulated, either by federal or state guidelines. Anyone on the street can wake up one morning and decided they want to start training dogs but that does not necessarily mean they should. A good trainer will utilize science backed, evidence based methods. They will seek out different certifications in their field (certifications that, again, are not required to call yourself a dog trainer) and continuing education lectures and workshops to stay up to date with modern methods and current studies. They will be respectful of any concerns you have, should have no issues with you observing a class to see their training style and observe how dogs and owners alike respond to their method of training, and should be open to collaborating with your veterinarian if behavioral modification and/or behavioral medications are prescribed.</p><p>One thing to definitely watch out for when finding a dog trainer is one that guarantees results or behavioral changes. Dogs, just like people, are all individuals and their personalities and behavior are as fluid as our own. For that reason, a trainer may be incredibly successful training a dog with one behavioral concern but that does not mean they will be able to successfully train all dogs with that same behavioral concern all the time. As with most things, if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.</p><p>Additional exercise, usually in the form of play time not involving other puppies, can also provide your puppy with a more appropriate outlet for aggressive play. Toys such as balls or stuffed toys allow you to play with your puppy from a distance and are perfect for this. A lot of puppy fights are not a result of an offensively aggressive puppy but rather a puppy that is just overstimulated and over aroused. Basically a puppy that is over aroused is just so excited about whatever is going on they cannot handle it and they pounce on whatever is nearby. Oftentimes over stimulation in puppies can be managed by increasing play time with their balls and stuffed toys.</p><p>Puppies need playtime with one another in order for them to grow up into confident, well-adjusted dogs. Knowing how to tell when a healthy tussle has crossed over into a true fight and knowing appropriate outlets for more aggressive play, though, is just as important for setting your puppy up for success.</p>",1050
101,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-ate-plastic-swallowed-foreign-objects-2804979,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>What to Do When Your Puppy Swallows a Foreign Object</h1>,"<h1>What to Do When Your Puppy Swallows a Foreign Object</h1><p>Puppies explore their world by mouthing, tasting, and chewing and as a result, they swallow foreign objects that can potentially make them sick. Puppies may gulp some things accidentally when a piece of a toy breaks off or something falls onto the ground without the owner's knowledge. Other dangerous objects prove too tempting-used tampons, and even grease-smeared foil proves irresistible to puppies who troll the wastebaskets for scraps. Foreign body obstruction in puppies can be a medical emergency that can cost you money and your puppy's life if not immediate attention is received.</p><h2> Commonly Swallowed Objects </h2><p>Veterinary pet insurance claims adjusters ranked the top 10 most common items surgically removed from pets' gastrointestinal tracts. The most common item is socks, followed by underwear, pantyhose, rocks, balls, chew toys, corn cobs, bones, hair ties/ribbons, and sticks. Most items tend to be owner-scented objects, but the list doesn't stop there.</p><p>Whole toys or parts of toys, jewelry, coins, pins, erasers, and paper clips are often swallowed. String, thread (with or without the needle), fishing hooks and lines, Christmas tree tinsel, and yarn are extremely dangerous. String from turkey roasts is particularly appealing so watch out for those holiday food hazards. And for puppies able to crunch up the object, pieces of wood or bone prove hazardous. Even too much of a rawhide chew can stop up his innards. Puppies may even eat rocks.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Never pull on the visible end of the string-either out the mouth or hanging out the puppy's rectum. String and thread are often attached to a needle, fishhook, or organ that's embedded in tissue further down the digestive tract. Pulling the string at your end could further injure the intestines and prove fatal.</p><h2> First Aid for Swallowed Objects </h2><p>If the item was swallowed within one to two hours, it's probably still in the stomach. Call your vet immediately to see if they advise inducing vomiting at the veterinary clinic. They may advise coming in right away to have vomiting induced or a call to an animal poison hotline (like the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Hotline) if there is a concern for toxicity. In some situations, they may advise inducing vomiting at home (however it is not recommended without the guidance of a veterinarian due to some safety concerns with at-home methods).</p><p>After two hours, the object will have passed into the intestines and vomiting won't help. You will still want to call your vet for advice. Many objects small enough to pass through the digestive system may be eliminated with the feces and cause no problems (however do risk this with coins or batteries). Feed a bulky meal of dry food to cushion stones or other heavy objects, and help them move on out. Food also turns on the digestive juices, which can help soften wads of rawhide treats, so they pass more readily.</p><p>In most cases as long as it is small enough, objects pass harmlessly through the body and end up on the lawn. Monitor your puppy's productivity. Use a disposable popsicle stick or plastic knife to chop up and search through the puppy droppings for the object.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If you've seen the pet swallow something they shouldn't and they become lethargic, have decreased appetite, vomiting, retching, diarrhea, repeatedly cough, or look distressed, seek help immediately. Any object, even tiny ones, potentially may lodge in and block the intestinal tract.</p><h2> Symptoms of Swallowed Objects </h2><p>Diagnosis can be based on seeing the puppy swallow something or based on symptoms. It's confirmed by X-rays or other diagnostics like an endoscope to determine the exact location and size of the blockage, and sometimes to identify the object itself. Specific signs depend on where the blockage is located and the type of object. Any of the following signs mean that your pet needs to go to the vet promptly: vomiting, diarrhea, decreased energy or interest in getting up, decreased appetite, inability to keep food or water down, retching, distended stomach, hunching, or seemingly painful.</p><p>Intestines propel food using muscle contractions called peristalsis that move through the entire length of the intestine (kind of like an earthworm) to help push the contents through. But when a foreign object like a string is caught at one end, the intestine literally ""gathers"" itself like fabric on a thread, resulting in a kind of accordion formation. The result is sudden severe vomiting and diarrhea, and rapid dehydration. Your veterinarian should evaluate any blockage situation to determine the best course of treatment. Surgery is often necessary to remove the obstruction.</p><h2> Treatment for Swallowed Objects </h2><p>If the blockage is not promptly addressed, the resulting damage may become irreparable. Sharp objects may slice or puncture the bowel, and obstruction from any objects may interfere with blood flow to the organs and cause bowel tissue to die. Peritonitis is the result in either case and usually proves fatal.</p><p>Once located, the object will be removed. The veterinarian can sometimes do this with an endoscope down the puppy's throat or the other direction up through his rectum, or with surgery. Any internal damage is repaired. If surgery can correct the problem before peritonitis sets in, most puppies fully recover. Should tissue die, the damaged sections of the intestine may be removed, and the living portions of the bowel reattached; these puppies typically have a decent prognosis but a lot depends on the specific location of the surgery and the degree of damage that was present at the time.</p><h2> How to Prevent Your Puppy From Swallowing a Foreign Object </h2><p>Most puppies outgrow indiscriminate munching. The best course is preventing your dog from swallowing dangerous items. Choose dog-safe toys that can't be chewed into tiny pieces, and supervise object play. Keep things picked up at all times and only allow chewing under your supervision. Anything a child would put in their mouth is fair game for puppies. Puppy-proof your home by thinking like your dog, so that you won't be caught off guard when your dog eats the rubber bumpers off the door stops. Keep trash up and away from your dogs no matter the age.</p>",1020
102,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-make-puppies-vomit-2804765,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How and When to Induce Vomiting in a Puppy</h1>,"<h1>How and When to Induce Vomiting in a Puppy</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Copr. Amy Shojai / CABC</p><p>From dirty socks to plastic toys, puppies put nearly everything in their mouths. Clueless puppies can chew up and swallow dangerous foreign objects or even-God forbid-poisonous toxins like antifreeze, poisonous houseplants, and forbidden people food. When your puppy eats something dangerous, inducing vomiting may be the first step in saving its life. Yet, not all situations warrant this drastic measure. For this reason, it's just as important to know when you should not induce vomiting as it is to know how to do it.</p><h2> When to Induce Vomiting </h2><p>It's very important to note that inducing vomiting is not the best course of action in many cases, even when puppies ingest poison. Inducing vomiting should be performed under the recommendation of a veterinarian or a pet poison control expert. When toxic foods or medications are ingested, symptoms may develop in as little as 20 minutes or take days to occur. Metal objects, such as coins, can cause zinc toxicity as they sit in the GI tract. Even if some time has passed since a puppy ate grapes (a toxic food to dogs) or Ibuprofen (a toxic medication to dogs), inducing vomiting can help get some of the toxin out of the digestive tract.</p><p>Say you witness a puppy swallowing a foreign object, such as a pair of underwear or a squeaky toy. Making your puppy throw it up may be the best course to take, while the item is still in the stomach. And even if you don't witness the dirty deed, but find suspicious evidence like a gnawed plant, chocolate candy wrappers, or an open bottle of pills, it may be a good idea to get your puppy to purge if the window of opportunity for ingestion is fairly narrow. Intervention before the toxin is fully absorbed or the foreign material moves into the intestines can sometimes make a world of difference.</p><h2> When Not to Induce Vomiting </h2><p>Some swallowed objects and poisons are just as dangerous coming back up as they are going down. Sharp objects such as pins, tacks, shards of glass or plastic, screws, needles, hooks from Christmas ornaments, or other pointy items can cut your pet's insides. Don't wait for sharp items to pass through your puppy's system. A vet needs to surgically remove these culprits. Take your puppy to your emergency room immediately.</p><p>Other fluid-like items may cause burns or further damage if they come back up. Chewed or swallowed batteries may leak acid, which can cause chemical burns to the stomach and esophagus. Do not induce vomiting if your puppy swallowed acids (such as bleach or drain cleaner), alkali liquids (such as ammonia or laundry detergent), motor oil or gas, paint or paint thinner, or any toxic houseplant. Instead, place a call to your vet or pet poison control immediately.</p><h2> How to Induce Vomiting </h2><p>First and foremost, make a call to your vet. It's always best to check with a professional before you induce vomiting. If you are not too far away from your vet, it is usually best to bring your pup into the office to have vomiting induced, as the products your vet has to make your dog vomit are safer and less irritating to a pet's stomach and esophagus. However, if you don't have time to get to the vet's office and the vet says it's safe and your puppy is alert, it's go-time. You can induce vomiting in a puppy up to 3 hours after it ingests a foreign substance or object, but the sooner, the better. Do note, however, that it can be dangerous to induce vomiting if the pup acts dizzy, seems depressed, or falls unconscious. If your puppy has these symptoms, it can inhale the material on its way up and suffocate.</p><p>To induce vomiting, first, contact a veterinary professional to confirm that inducing vomiting is the best course of action. Feeding a small amount of food before vomiting is sometimes (but not always) recommended. Remember, you're not rewarding your puppy for eating something it shouldn't, but sometimes diluting the poison with food helps delay its absorption. For solid objects, food may also act as padding and lubricant when the item comes back up. Plus, it can be tough to get a puppy to upchuck if its tummy is too empty.</p><p>Next, give your puppy 3% hydrogen peroxide with an eyedropper or plastic syringe (without a needle). Make sure the peroxide is still fizzy or it won't work. Check with your veterinarian to find out how much to give your pet based on their size and overall health. A squirt gun or turkey baster also works well in this instance. The peroxide will tastes nasty and make your puppy's mouth foam. This combination usually prompts puppies to vomit in about five minutes. If your puppy doesn't vomit within 15 minutes, ask your veterinarian if you should repeat a dose or just move in to the next step of treatment.</p><p>Hydrogen peroxide is the only household product that should be used to try to induce vomiting. In the past, syrup of ipecac and salt have been used to induce vomiting but this s not recommended. Syrup of ipecac can be damaging to a dog's heart. Giving salt can result in salt poisoning which can cause the brain to swell.</p><p>After your pet has emptied its stomach, call your vet. A vet may want you to bring your pup in, along with a sample of the vomit. A vet can offer an antidote or other follow-up measures to give your puppy the best chance at survival.</p><p>The best way to deal with problem poisons or dangerous items is to prevent the problem from happening in the first place. Place child-proof locks on cupboards, keep sweet candy and pills out of reach, and puppy-proof holiday decorations to keep your baby dog safe.</p>",984
103,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-development-part-1-2804676,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Development From 1 to 8 Weeks</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Development From 1 to 8 Weeks</h1><p>During 1-8 weeks of age, a puppy will be extremely dependent on their mother because they need special care to be nourished and socialized. The mother will provide her puppies with the nutrition they need until they are fully weaned and are less dependent on the mother to survive.</p><p>Over the coming weeks, the puppy will grow out of its infancy into a young puppy. They will begin to socialize in their environments once they're physically able to do so. From interacting with their littermates to humans, the period of four to seven weeks is the ideal time to introduce your puppy to numerous people that will handle them gently.</p><h3>Watch Now: All You Need to Know about Puppies</h3><h2> Physical Development </h2><p>At one week old, puppies' eyes are still closed. Their eyes will begin to open in the second week of life, usually between 10 and 16 days of age. However, they won't be able to see clearly at first. The eyes will gradually open wider, revealing grayish-blue eyes with a hazy appearance. Puppies' eyes will continue to develop over the next several weeks, reaching full vision around eight weeks of age.</p><p>Puppies' ears begin to open around the time that the eyes do, generally around 12 to 14 days old. Their hearing will continue to develop until the puppies are around five weeks old.</p><p>Newborn puppies cannot fully support their weight for the first two weeks of life, so they crawl around on their bellies, paddling and pushing with their legs and building strength. Most puppies will be able to rise up on their forelimbs around 5 to 6 days of age and will begin to use their hind legs around two weeks old. They usually begin to walk with a wobbly gait around 18 to 21 days of age.</p><p>Puppies need to be stimulated to urinate and defecate for the first several weeks of life. Mom does this by licking the anal and genital areas. If you are raising an orphaned pup, you can use a warm, damp cloth or cotton ball to stimulate the area. Puppies gradually develop the ability to urinate and defecate on their own around three to four weeks of age.</p><p>Puppies are born without teeth. Their baby teeth, or ""milk teeth"" will begin to come in between three and four weeks of age and continue to develop until about eight weeks of age.</p><h2> Behavior Changes </h2><p>For newborn puppies, the first two weeks of life are all about sleeping and eating. After 14 days of age, physical changes open up a whole new world. They begin to see, hear and walk. By the age of 21 days, they begin to explore the world and learn about being dogs. This is also when the socialization process begins. Puppies learn how to interact with other dogs by interacting with their mother and littermates. Human socialization with gentle handling is important at this time as well.</p><p>Around seven to eight weeks old, the first ""fear period"" will begin. This is a time when most puppies seem to be afraid of new things. Anything you can introduce them to before this time may help make the fear period go more smoothly.</p><h2> Health and Care </h2><p>Mom will still be taking on most of the care for her puppies until they are fully weaned between five to eight weeks of age. However, her puppies will become less and less dependent on her after three to four weeks of age. You may find that the puppies wander out of their little ""nest"" and try to check out more of the house. It may be best to keep mom and pups in an exercise pen when you are not home.</p><p>The first few weeks of life are a time of vulnerability for the puppies. If a puppy is not growing at the same rate as its littermates, it should be seen by a vet as soon as possible. In addition, any sign of illness, no matter how subtle, should be taken seriously.</p><h2> Food and Nutrition </h2><p>For the first three weeks of life, puppies get the nutrition they need from their mother's milk. If the puppy was orphaned or needs supplemental nutrition, puppy formula can provide the necessary nutrients.</p><p>After baby teeth have erupted, around three weeks old, the puppies may be ready to begin weaning. Mom may naturally begin this process as she feels those puppy teeth nipping at her teats. A good way to transition the pups to dog food is to bring out some canned puppy food or softened puppy kibble (use warm formula or water to soften the kibble). Be sure to choose a dog food intended for growth. You can encourage them to eat it by offering a taste from your finger. As puppies get used to the puppy food, they will gradually nurse less and less. Most pups are fully weaned by six to eight weeks of age.</p><h2> Training and Socialization </h2><p>Puppies between one to three weeks are still too young to respond to training or socialization. At three to four weeks, they are able to see, hear, walk, and urinate/defecate on their own. Though their brains are still developing, they are capable of learning some things.</p><p>Of course, it is still important for these young pups to remain with their mother and littermates until eight to twelve weeks of age. As early as three to four weeks of age, you can start to introduce the crate and start some basic potty training. Even if the pups will be getting homes between eight to twelve weeks of age, you can start laying the groundwork for training.</p><p>The time between four to seven weeks of age is an early socialization window. Although the puppy must remain with its mother, it is now ready to be exposed to new sights and sounds. It should start meeting people of all ages and appearances. This includes children who know how to act around dogs and will handle the puppy gently.</p>",994
104,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hip-dysplasia-in-puppies-2804943,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>What Are the Signs of Hip Dysplasia in Puppies?</h1>,"<h1>What Are the Signs of Hip Dysplasia in Puppies?</h1><p>Hip dysplasia in puppies is a progressive, degenerative disease of the hip joints, and is the most common cause of rear-end lameness in dogs. Canine hip dysplasia is most often seen in large breeds like German Shepherd dogs, Saint Bernards, and Greater Swiss Mountain dogs, but a dog of any size and both male and female dogs may be affected.</p><p>The cause of canine hip dysplasia isn't known. The condition is thought to have a genetic link, and dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Puppies from parents that have hip dysplasia will be more likely to develop the condition than puppies born to parents with normal hips. However, even dogs with normal parents can develop hip dysplasia.</p><h2> What Is Canine Hip Dysplasia? </h2><p>The pelvis cradles the head of the femur (thigh bone) in a cup-like socket of bone that forms the hip. Puppies typically are born normal, but as the puppy matures, the hip joint alignment becomes progressively worse.</p><p>As a young pet grows, if the alignment isn't just right due to bone abnormalities or laxity of the ligaments and muscles that hold the joint together, the misalignment causes wear and tear on the joint. Pups suffering from dysplasia typically have a very shallow socket and/or loose joints. This places abnormal stress and wear on the bones when they rub together, and causes further joint degeneration and pain. Bones respond to stress by growing thicker, which makes the fit even worse. As the dog matures, this damage predisposes to arthritic changes and painful joints.</p><h2> Signs and Symptoms </h2><p>Severe hip dysplasia may become noticeable as early as four months of age, but is more typically seen in pups aged 9 months to 1 year. The painful condition causes limping, favoring of limbs, and difficulty rising, running, or jumping. Dysplastic pups may exhibit an odd wobbly gait when walking and ""bunny hop"" when running or climbing stairs, which may help to ease joint stress. Stairs can prove a particular challenge for these dogs, and sore hips and pain may prompt aggression, causing the pup to snap or flinch when touched.</p><p>However, there are degrees of severity. Some pups may show few to no signs at all, and mild cases may go undiagnosed until the dog reaches middle age or older. How quickly, or to what extent degeneration occurs is in part determined by the pup's activity level. While healthy, normal hips probably won't be adversely affected by hard work or exuberant play, the dog with mild to moderate hip dysplasia develops more noticeable signs more quickly when excessive stress is placed on these joints. Fortunately, only a relatively small percentage of pets suffer the severest, most crippling form of the condition.</p><p>Hip dysplasia is considered ""polygenetic"" by veterinarians, which means the genetic component of the disease can be influenced by several genes. The condition may also be influenced by lifestyle, nutrition, body weight, and activity level.</p><h2> Diagnosis </h2><p>Outward signs may point to a problem, but for a conclusive diagnosis, X-rays are performed while the puppy is under anesthesia. The puppy is placed on its back and the veterinarian looks for the typical arthritic changes and subluxation (laxity) of the joint. Some changes may not become evident until the pup reaches 2 years old, and experts say there may be considerable changes from 6 to 9 months up to 1 year.</p><p>That's why the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) screening and certification cannot be done prior to the age of 2 years in dogs. The OFA provides a consulting service for purebred dog owners and breeders, through which it reviews hip X-rays provided by an owner to evaluate the dog's conformation and, when normal, certifies that fact.</p><p>The PennHip testing method, developed by Dr. Gail Smith, a veterinary orthopedic specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, also positions the pet on its back, but then fits a metal and acrylic form, called a ""distracter,"" between the animal's hips. This brace positions the pup's rear legs sort of like a frog pose, to replicate what happens when standing. The resulting X-ray helps gauge the pet's laxity score or ""distraction index"" and allows veterinarians to determine the degree of joint looseness even before bone changes from damage occur. Whatever laxity or looseness it has at 4 months, it'll have for the rest of its life.</p><p>Reputable breeders have dog parents tested prior to breeding to make sure they do not have hip dysplasia and reduce the chance of the condition in puppies. Dogs can be certified free of hip dysplasia by sending appropriate X-rays to either the OFA registry or the PennHip registry. The OFA costs less because there's only one X-ray taken. This is evaluated by three radiologists who score the hips fair, good, or excellent. PennHip evaluation uses computer analysis to compare the X-rays to all the other dogs of that breed in the registry.</p><h2> Management of Hip Dysplasia </h2><p>There is no cure for hip dysplasia. Treatment is aimed at relieving pain and improving joint function. How well treatment works depends on the severity of the problem.</p><p>Often, mild to moderate cases of hip dysplasia can be managed with gentle exercise, a healthy diet, and oral pain relievers like buffered aspirin or Rimadyl as prescribed by the veterinarian. Moderate exercise helps maintain and improve the puppy's muscle tone, which alleviates painful wear and tear on the joint.</p><p>Encourage your dysplastic puppy to take short walks with you. Swimming is an ideal exercise, but jumping and prolonged running should be discouraged. Keep your puppy lean; obesity increases joint strain and can make the condition worse. Massage can also help the dog feel better.</p><p>Severe cases of hip dysplasia may benefit from surgery that rebuilds or removes bone or alters the muscles and tendons to reduce pain. Such procedures may not fully restore joint function but can give the dog improved movement and enhance the pup's long-term quality of life.</p>",983
105,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-play-how-puppies-play-2804905,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>All the Ways a Puppy Likes to Play</h1>,"<h1>All the Ways a Puppy Likes to Play</h1><p>How puppies play depends on a great deal. Socialization and age are huge factors, but dogs also have their own preferences. Some dogs react more to seeing objects move, while others relish tug-of-war or ""hide and seek"" type play.</p><p>Canine play is composed of exaggerated and highly ritualized gestures used in doggy communication. That allows dogs to ""play fight"" for instance, yet avoid misunderstandings that might result in real fights.</p><h2> How Puppies Play </h2><p>Play behavior begins as early as puppies can toddle around-about three weeks of age. Puppies of both sexes may exhibit sexual behavior as early as four weeks of age, mounting each other during play games.Prey killing behavior such as pouncing and object shaking is also seen.</p><p>Puppies at these early ages learn bite inhibition, how to ""take turns"" while playing, and how to communicate with each other. Because dogs learn so much communication at early ages, most breeders and veterinarians recommend that puppies stay with their mothers until at least 8 weeks of age. Temperament extremes-a bully puppy or shrinking violet pooch-expressed in play by young puppies is not necessarily a good predictor of future status. Temperament tests are more accurate when conducted on older puppies.</p><h2> Social Play </h2><p>Social play is interactive. In other words, social play involves playing with another puppy, the owner, or even the cat. Examples of social play include wrestling, biting, play-fighting, and chase games.</p><p>Puppies begin social play as early as three weeks of age, with play-biting, pawing, and barking. The intensity escalates and becomes more complex as the dog matures. The first play-eliciting gesture seen in puppies is the raised paw. The play bow-butt end up, front down- is the classic invitation for a canine romp and is used by older pups and adults, along with barking, leaping forward to nose-poke and then withdrawing, face pawing or licking. This type of play is particularly important in dogs social and behavioral development until they are 10 to 12 weeks old.</p><h2> Self-Directed Play </h2><p>Self-directed play, such as tail chasing or pouncing on imaginary objects, is thought to be a replacement for social play when a play-partner isn't available. Puppies that indulge in extremes of tail-chasing or habitually target ""invisible"" objects-snapping at nonexistent bugs-should be checked by the vet. These may be indications of obsessive-compulsive or seizure conditions.</p><h2> Locomotory Play </h2><p>Locomotory play simply means the puppy is in motion. That can involve solo play or include interaction with others. Locomotory play in adult dogs usually involves a pair or group of dogs. But puppies may indulge in games of ""ghost-tag"" running, jumping, and rolling about when they're by themselves.</p><h2> Object Play </h2><p>Object play is interaction with stuff. Chasing or pawing/grabbing a ball, rag, or stick are examples. Some puppies target water and love chasing the hose or sprinkler.</p><h2> Inviting Play and Taking Turns </h2><p>Dogs may ""pretend"" to be aggressive to invite play and indicate it's a game by using exaggerated behaviors, called meta signals. For instance, the play-bow is a butt-in-the-air with a front-end-down position where the pup's forelegs dance back and forth to invite play. When your puppy first play-bows, it's telling you that any growls or wrestling that comes after are meant as fun and games. Adult dogs often ""pretend"" to be subordinate to a puppy-with play-bows or rolling on the back-to build up the pup's confidence and invite it to play.</p><p>Dogs also commonly drop toys at your feet-or in front of other pets-to invite play. Inhibited bites using open mouths aimed at legs and paws of other dogs also are common play behaviors.</p><p>When dogs are playing, it is normal to see pups ""take turns"". One dog will start as the instigator or chaser, and then the other will take a turn as ""lead"". When a dog ignores the cues of the other that there needs to be a break in play or a change of ""turn"" is when we start to be concerned about bullying or a dog becoming more excitable than is appropriate.</p><h2> Bad Play </h2><p>Inappropriate play can develop when pups get too wound up or one of the playmates becomes a bully. Normal puppy play encourages taking turns chasing and pinning each other. But bully dogs always end up on top during wrestling, and instead of play bites at the legs, the bites target the head or neck. Most of the time, growls during play are normal but if they turn to lower-pitched growls or the puppy-on-the-bottom yelps too much, break up the session until they calm down.</p><p>Play that seems to always end up on the hind legs may be a warning sign to have pups cool their jets. Some mounting and clasping or thrusting won't be a problem, when these become the norm, play may have tipped over into bully behavior. Also, a dog that is attempting to hide under or around something and the other dog appears to be ""waiting them out"" can be an indicator that it is time to take a break.</p><p>Play not only is great fun for you and the pup, but it teaches important doggy lessons. During play, puppies figure out what is and isn't acceptable behavior, discover how their bodies work, and learn ways to interact with other animals and the world around them. Many training facilities offer puppy socialization classes. Puppy socialization classes are a great way to allow your pup to learn how to communicate with lots of different dogs in a controlled and supervised environment to ensure safety. Different dogs have different ear, tail and face shape and expression, so it is important for them to learn how to ""read"" lots of different types of dogs. Research a few options in your area and sign your pup up for some socialization and play that will keep him happy and comfortable around other dogs long term.</p>",975
106,https://www.thesprucepets.com/your-dogs-big-milestones-past-puppyhood-4688495,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>Your Dog's Big First-Year Milestones and Beyond</h1>,"<h1>Your Dog's Big First-Year Milestones and Beyond</h1><h2>All the Milestones Your Puppy Will Hit, Plus What Comes Next</h2><p>There are few things more exciting as a dog parent than that first year with your puppy, when everything is new and your puppy is growing and learning at an almost unstoppable pace.</p><p>From the day you bring your puppy home to the day it officially crosses over into adult dog territory, each milestone you hit is a reminder of the joys of life with dogs and the exciting transitions that make all those late night potty breaks (and early morning potty mishaps) worth it.</p><p>The exact age your puppy hits each of his major milestones in the first year depends on a couple of key factors, but by the time he turns about two to three, he should have all of them under his belt. So what are these milestones? Here are nine puppy milestones you'll have to look forward to.</p><h2> 1. ""Gotcha"" Day </h2><p>Gotcha day-also known as adoption day-is one of the most important milestones for both your puppy and for you. Give his time to explore his new home, and provide plenty of toys and chews so he doesn't look to things like your furniture, shoes, and electrical cords for entertainment.</p><p>Be patient during these earliest days of your puppy checking out his new home. He won't know what's expected of him yet, and may be a bit stressed by being in an unfamiliar environment. However, with plenty of love and attention, it will start to feel like home in no time.</p><h2> 2. Meeting the Vet </h2><p>Your new pup will need to meet his vet soon, since puppies need a lot of vaccinations in their first year. It's also a good idea to have your puppy established with a vet as soon as possible in case you ever have any questions or mishaps.</p><p>Bring along any medical paperwork that was provided to you when you adopted your puppy. Dogs get their first vaccinations at roughly eight weeks of age but will need boosters within the next several weeks. The next booster typically is administered at around 12 weeks of age, and the third and final set at 16 weeks (this puppy vaccination schedule can give you a good idea of what's needed when).</p><h2> 3. The End of House Training </h2><p>With consistent house training your pup shouldn't be having accidents in the house once they're two to three months old.</p><p>To ensure you don't have any setbacks, take your puppy out on a regular schedule, staying outside with him until he goes potty and giving lots of praise and treats. If he has an accident in the house, clean it up without talking or looking in their direction-that way, he won't associate going to the bathroom in the house with getting your attention. And when he finally does ask to go outside, celebrate!</p><h2> 4. Starting to Interact With Other Dogs </h2><p>The first 12 weeks of a puppy's life are crucial when it comes to socialization, so it's important that your puppy gets a chance to meet other dogs before he turns three months old. Start after week seven, since that's when your puppy will have his first round of vaccinations.</p><p>Puppy classes are a good way to start, as are puppy play groups and bringing your puppy to meet the dogs of your friends and family members. Hold off on dog parks for now, until your puppy learns a bit more about dog manners.</p><h2> 5. Responding to His Name </h2><p>It can take a few weeks for a puppy to learn his own name, depending on how consistently it's used and what sort of training techniques are used. So that your puppy doesn't get confused, only call him by his full name for these first several months and wait to try out all of his many nicknames until he's got the basics down.</p><h2> 6. Losing His Baby Teeth </h2><p>Yep, puppies lose baby teeth, too! Your pup's baby teeth (sometimes also called milk teeth) will start to fall out around month four, and they should have a new set of adult chompers by month seven. Don't be surprised if you don't find any puppy teeth around the house, since most puppies just end up swallowing them; they are very tiny!</p><p>Once your puppy's adult teeth are in, start getting him used to regular brushings, since the earlier you acclimate your pup to the feel of a toothbrush, the better.</p><h2> 7. Spay/Neuter </h2><p>Puppies can be spayed or neutered as early as eight weeks old, but between months six and nine is more common and preferred to allow for adequate skeletal growth and maturity, especially in larger dog breeds.</p><h2> 8. Training Classes </h2><p>Puppy class is mostly about socialization, but by the time your puppy is seven or eight months old, he should be ready for training class. There, he'll learn crucial obedience skills like ""sit,"" ""stay,"" ""leave it"", ""heel"", and ""come."" Note that you can train at home too, but make sure that your puppy is still getting plenty of outside socialization with other dogs.</p><h2> 9. First Birthday </h2><p>Here's a milestone that's definitely worth pawty-ing over! By your puppy's first birthday, he should have met all of the milestones on this list and be well on his way to being a loving and well behaved adult. Do be prepared though for what comes immediately after: your dog's teenage years! There will be some acting out, but with patience you'll get through it together.</p><p>So what now? The milestones your dog hits in his adult years vary. Maybe it's his first trip to the beach, his first human sibling, or his first time running a 5k with you. Whatever the milestones are, celebrate both the big stuff and the little stuff, and be grateful for the time that you have together. </p>",968
107,https://www.thesprucepets.com/introducing-dogs-and-puppies-2805078,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Train an Older Dog to Accept a New Puppy</h1>,"<h1>How to Train an Older Dog to Accept a New Puppy</h1><p>Before you plan on bringing a puppy home, make plans for how to introduce the new puppy to older dogs that already live there. Adult dogs often welcome a new canine buddy, but it's important to try to set yourself up for success. Introducing a puppy to another dog will involve strategies like meeting on neutral ground, sniffing through a fence, and parallel walking.</p><p>It's important to remember that a resident dog naturally protects its turf. Your puppy may either feel uncertain in strange surroundings or act like a clueless clown who hisses off the mature canines. Proper introductions help ensure both pets start off on the same positive paw.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Some puppies will require quarantine before meeting the rest of the doggy family as well. This ensures that if the puppy has any illnesses, it won't transmit the disease to the other animals.</p><h2> Meet on Neutral Ground </h2><p>The first meetings between a puppy and an adult dog should take place on neutral ground, such as a neighbor's yard, training center, or tennis court. That way, your older pooch doesn't feel fearful, threatened, or protective of your house or yard. Instead, it can get down to the business of making friends with the puppy.</p><p>If a neutral place isn't available, visit a park that a variety of dogs frequent. Your resident dog will have fewer territorial claims and feel more willing to meet the new pup.</p><h2> Start With a Fence Meeting </h2><p>Dogs can read your tension if you're the least bit wary. When this elevated excitement combines with a leash restraint, then fearful aggression could develop. That's why first dog-to-dog meetings should take place between unleashed dogs.</p><p>For safety's sake, however, let the dogs meet through a chain-link fence or tennis net, so they can sniff each other while the barrier keeps them separated. This helps the ""new dog"" novelty wear off before a true nose-to-nose meeting.</p><p>It's also important when there's a size difference between the resident dog and the new pup. Even friendly adult dogs could accidentally injure the youngster with over-exuberant greetings.</p><h2> Try Parallel Walking </h2><p>Take both dogs for a walk, parallel to each other, with a different person handling each dog. Keep the leashes loose and give the dogs room to move, so you reduce the potential for tension.</p><p>At first, keep the dogs out of the nose-sniffing range, and use a treat or toy to keep doggy eyes on the human (no challenge-staring at the other dog allowed). Walk them together for 5 or 10 minutes before allowing a head-to-head meeting.</p><h2> Offer Sniffing Opportunities </h2><p>Once the dogs show a happy interest in meeting, let them come together while keeping the leashes loose. Choose an area with open space to reduce tension. The dogs will sniff each other's bodies, including rear ends, which is proper canine greeting etiquette.</p><p>First greetings should be kept to only 10 minutes or so to keep the dogs from tiring. Make a point of calling each dog away from time to time to give a treat or toy. This will prevent any escalating tension and maintain a happy mood.</p><h2> Look for Positive Signs </h2><p>It is a good sign if the dogs want to play together. Watch for the doggy language that signals good intentions. A classic canine invitation to a game is the ""play bow,"" in which the tail end goes up and the head goes down. Doggy yawning also signals, ""I am no threat"" and can be a very positive sign from either dog. Whines, barks, and growls are used in both play and threats, so pay attention to other body language to better judge what the dogs mean.</p><p>Licking the mouth and face of the other dog and rolling on the back in dog language signals submission. The puppy should display these behaviors, which tells the older dog that it's just a baby and to cut the youngster some slack. Allow play for only a few minutes during the first meeting, then stop and end the introduction on a good note.</p><h2> Move to Home Ground </h2><p>Once they've met off home territory, repeat the introduction in your yard-off-leash if it's fenced. Call the dog and puppy apart every few minutes to ensure they don't become too excited. Remember, the new pup should only meet one resident dog at a time, not the whole gang at once.</p><h2> Meet in the House </h2><p>Finally, arrange to have all of your resident dogs outside of the house when you first bring the new pup indoors. Do this out of sight of the other canines. For instance, have your resident dogs in the fenced backyard playing while you bring the new puppy in the front door. For the fewest potential problems, the resident dogs should enter the house and find the new dog already there.</p><h2> Problems and Troubleshooting Behavior </h2><p>Most dogs quickly work out their social ranking and decide how to interact in a positive way. It's best for the puppy to be segregated in a room alone with a baby gate barrier when you are not there to directly supervise.</p><p>As much as you may want your dogs to hit it off right away, be sure to take things slow and stay in control of the situation. Common mistakes include be nervous or anxious and letting the dogs meet on their own too early. Do your best to keep every meeting between the dogs happy and let them get used to each other's scents gradually. It's important to start things off right in order to establish a comfortable doggie home for everyone.</p>",934
108,https://www.thesprucepets.com/blood-type-2804995,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Dog Blood Types</h1>,"<h1>Dog Blood Types</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Do dogs have blood types, and is it important for you to know your puppy's blood type? Although blood from a donor offers lifesaving help, today we know that donor blood may carry parasites or viruses. In addition, all canine blood is not created equal-just like people, pets have different blood types and these differences are inherited. Giving incompatible blood can have life-threatening consequences.</p><h2> What Are Blood Types </h2><p>Blood groups and types vary and the differences are inherited. Antigens on the surface of the blood cells define a blood type. Antigens are substances that stimulate the body's immune system.</p><p>When a dog has those specific antigens on its red cells, it's said to be positive for that particular group. If the red cells do not have a given antigen, then the pet is negative for that blood group. This is important, because when a puppy is injured or ill, a transfusion with whole blood or blood components may be necessary to save the pet's life. Giving the wrong type of blood can have dire consequences.</p><h2> Transfusion Reactions </h2><p>People (and cats) have very strong antibodies against the wrong type of blood. Our immune system recognizes noncompatible blood as foreign, and attacks and destroys the blood as if it were a virus or bacteria. When a person receives a blood transfusion and the wrong blood is given, this transfusion reaction can quickly kill the individual.</p><p>The signs, though, are non-specific and can range from subtle to severe. To minimize the risk of transfusion reactions, the veterinary staff will recommend testing prior to giving a transfusion and will monitor dogs closely while transfusions are being administered. Signs of a reaction include a change in heartbeat, difficulty breathing, collapse, drooling, tremors, convulsions, weakness, vomiting, and fever. Fortunately, severe reactions are rare in dogs.</p><h2> First Transfusions </h2><p>Dogs rarely have naturally occurring antibodies the way people and cats do. The dog's immune system doesn't seem to immediately recognize incompatible blood, but must be first exposed to incompatible blood before building antibodies against it. For that reason, most dogs can receive a transfusion from any other blood group the first time. After that, though, the immune system is ""primed"" to recognize the foreign blood and if it's given again, a life-threatening transfusion reaction can happen.</p><p>Many times, a dog's first transfusion takes place under emergency circumstances to save the dog's life. If he's never before been transfused, it's likely he'll have no adverse reaction to the blood, even if it is incompatible. It's advisable whenever possible-and always after your puppy has been previously transfused-to identify the dog's blood type so that sensitization of your dog's blood and/or a possible life-threatening reaction can be avoided.</p><h2> Canine Blood Types and Breeds </h2><p>You'll find different numbers of dog blood types listed; as many as 13 group systems have been identified but six are most commonly recognized. Dogs can be classified as positive or negative for each DEA (dog erythrocyte antigen). An erythrocyte is a red blood cell.</p><p>The canine blood groups most commonly recognized are DEA-1.1, DEA-1.2, DEA-3, DEA-4, DEA-5, and DEA-7.</p><p>Some blood types cause more dangerous reactions than others, and the DEA-1.1 group is the worst offender. Dogs that are negative for DEA 1.1 and other blood types are considered ""universal donors"" able to give to any other blood typed dog. DEA 1.1 negative is in the minority of dogs.</p><p>The majority of dogs are DEA 1.1 positive and may only give blood safely to other DEA 1.1. positive dogs. An incompatible transfusion can result in both clumping and destruction of the red cells. Usually, the reaction is immediate, but it may be delayed up to four days.</p><p>Some breeds have a predisposition to being DEA 1.1 positive or negative. On the negative column, breeds likely to be DEA 1.1 negative include greyhounds, boxers, Irish wolfhounds, German shepherds, dobermans, and pit bulls. Breeds more commonly DEA 1.1 positive are golden retrievers and labradors. If your puppy is one of these breeds, it would be a good idea to have your furry wonder's blood typed.</p><h2> Blood Banks and Dogs </h2><p>Transfusion medicine has made great strides in the past decade since dogs and cats often require a transfusion as a part of their treatment. In 1989, one of the first blood banks for pets was launched by Angell Memorial Animal Hospital in Boston. Today, a standard unit of whole canine blood is 500cc, or almost 17 ounces, while packed red blood cells and plasma units are smaller. A pet's size and degree of illness determine the type and amount of blood product needed. A number of blood donor programs run by veterinary teaching hospitals, as well as private commercial entities, are currently available.</p><p>Some blood donor programs enlist pet dogs, based on several criteria including health, weight, and age. Others facilities may already have colonies of dogs (greyhounds are common because most are DEA1.1 negative-but they're positive for DEA 3) that get lots of attention and treats for their participation and later may be adopted.</p><p>Veterinarians now have easy-to-use canine and feline typing cards to screen for the most problematic blood types in their offices. Cross-matching can also be easily done, and although it won't determine the type, it will tell whether a transfusion reaction is likely to occur.</p>",871
109,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-dog-training-methods-2805083,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Modern Puppy Training Techniques</h1>,"<h1>Modern Puppy Training Techniques</h1><p>Puppy training techniques have changed over the years, and modern puppy training methods are good news for you and your canine friends. Many dog trainers learned their trade while training dogs for the military of the 1940s and 50s. Military dog training was based on the notion that the dog is your adversary in the training field, and you must dominate him before he dominates you. The training process became an extremely rigorous temperament test, very physical, almost brutal. Such methods do nothing to enhance or preserve a loving, caring relationship that modern owners want and expect.</p><p>""The idea was to make sure poor temperament would show up in early training rather than on the battlefield or in the trenches. So if they're going to break, break them when it's not important,"" says Dr. Ian Dunbar, a behaviorist in Berkeley, California. ""These methods applied to pet dog training, of course, are totally unsuitable."" While these methods remain in practice today, equally effective and more humane options are available.</p><h2> Modern Dog Training </h2><p>The theory of operant conditioning and reward training deals with relationships between stimuli, responses, and consequences-the puppy learns that what he does is critical to what happens next. Instead of simply reacting to avoid punishment the puppy learns to think-associate your ""come"" command with receiving positive attention.</p><p>The traditional coercion methods relied on waiting for the dog to make a mistake, then using leash-jerk corrections and physically pushing and positioning the dog. With the new protocol, puppies are encouraged to want to perform the task on their own.</p><p>Dr. Dunbar urges owners to see pet dog training from the dog's point of view. ""Training should be efficient, effective, easy, and enjoyable, or pet owners and the dogs won't do it,"" he says.</p><h2> Training Equipment </h2><p>Some of the newest training tools reflect this evolution in training philosophy. Tools like the Easy Walk Harness communicate with dogs in a natural fashion with gentle pressure, preventing them from jumping up or lunging forward. The Halti and the Gentle Leader head halters fit over the dog's face, and with gentle guidance, gets even giant-size dogs to go where guided-no jerking necessary.</p><p>The more traditional slip, Martingale or ""choke"" collars must be fitted appropriately and used correctly. A quick jerk-release directs the dog's actions. But if fitted wrong, the collar won't release the pressure, so a pet owner can easily hurt the dog by accident. Puppies and toy dog breeds are particularly prone to injuries like collapsed trachea and can be permanently damaged by a jerk to the neck.</p><p>Electronic collars-those that deliver a remote-controlled low-impulse shock to correct poor behavior-are even more controversial. Many ethicists object to their use altogether. Even proponents agree that only professional trainers are qualified to use electronic training tools. E-collars train based on punishing bad actions rather than rewarding good behavior and dogs often revert to old habits and run away unless they wear the collar all of the time.</p><h2> Reward Training </h2><p>Other training techniques teach pets to recognize the desired behavior by linking the action to appropriately timed verbal praise, sound signals such as a clicker training tool, or ""cookie"" (food) rewards. Whether you use a head halter, a clicker or verbal command, or cookie power, the major part of training involves teaching the puppy or adult dog</p><p>""'If you sit, Fido, I'll open the door.' Or 'If you sit, I'll put your leash on.' 'If you sit, I'll throw the tennis ball,'"" says Dr. Dunbar, ""so then the dog says, 'I love this sitting thing!'"" Dr. Dunbar says teaching the dog the meaning of the word ""sit"" is only five percent of the training; 95 percent of training teaches the dog, ""Why do it?""</p><p>""Training is a way the two of you learn to dance together in a very individual and exquisite choreography,"" he says. ""You learn to lead and follow each others' lead-and you don't invite someone to dance by jerking on their necklace or necktie!""</p><h2> When to Start Puppy Training </h2><p>Puppies are little sponges and they absorb lessons quickly. Your baby dog starts to learn the moment he sets paw in your home, and one of the most important lessons is to teach him that learning is .</p><p>By six to eight weeks of age, your puppy can easily learn basic commands simply by teaching him how to learn. Puppies that enjoy training eagerly lap up more challenging tricks and commands as they mature.</p><p>Please avoid using the word ""no!"" when your puppy does something wrong. It's so overused that some puppies begin to believe that ""no"" is their name. Remember that training is learning, and puppies learn by making mistakes so they know what work, and choose better options.</p><p>A more powerful training word is ""yes."" Find opportunities to say ""yes!"" by catching your puppy in the act of doing something you like. If he does something unacceptable, instead of shouting ""no!"" try to find a method that encourages him into a legal alternate behavior. Look for opportunities to reward good behavior and replace bad choices with acceptable ones.</p><p>Puppies have short attention spans. Several short training sessions of about five to ten minutes each will be more successful than a single marathon training time. Set up a schedule in your routine so that you know your puppy has the energy and eagerness to learn. A good time is before meals because you can use a portion of his meals as treat rewards during training, without upsetting his nutrition.</p>",908

Dog collars have been a mainstay of dog training equipment for decades, but in recent years, harnesses have become increasingly popular. </p><h3>What is a dog harness?</h3><p>Similar to a dog collar, a harness is a type of wearable equipment that owners place on their dogs. Rather than wrapping in a circle around the dog's neck like a collar, a harness is fitted around the dog's torso with straps behind the front legs to distribute any tension to its chest.</p><p>There are pros and cons to both pieces of equipment, and it's important to understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of a dog harness versus collar. In addition, some dog breeds or personality types may benefit from one option more than the other. </p><h2> Pros and Cons of Dog Collars </h2><p>A dog collar is a common sight on pooches of all shapes and sizes, and for good reason. It's the simplest way to identify that a dog has an owner, and most collars allow for easy attachment of identification tags. Should your dog ever become lost or escape the backyard, a collar can serve as an instant visual cue to others that your dog has a home. The attached identification tags can also help your dog get safely returned to you. </p><p>While they're indispensable for identification, a dog collar may not always be the right choice as a training tool or point of control on your dog. The collar can place significant pressure on some of your dog's most delicate and vulnerable areas-like the trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, cervical vertebrae, and more. A quick, hard tug on the leash or constant pulling from your pet can cause pain or even damage to these important areas. </p><p>In addition, your dog might be more likely to slide out of a collar and escape. This is especially true in dog breeds where the width of the neck and the head are similar-Sighthounds, like Greyhounds and Whippets, frequently suffer from this issue. In such cases, a collar may not be the most effective way to keep your dog safe and by your side. </p><h2> Pros and Cons of Dog Harnesses </h2><p>Harnesses for dogs come in many different styles, but the basic idea is the same-to distribute any force exerted on the leash across a larger area of the dog's body rather than in a confined space around the neck. They're popular as a first option with puppies, but have also been used by owners of dogs that like to pull on walks or that are large and harder to control. </p><p>The biggest benefit of a dog harness is the shift in pressure from the neck to a larger area of the body. However, it's very important to note that a poor-fitting harness can be just as detrimental to your dog's well-being as a collar with too much pressure applied in the wrong area. It's important to make sure that your dog's natural range of movement isn't hindered, particularly around the shoulders or in the extension of the front legs. </p><p>A harness can also reduce walk time woes in a number of ways. It generally provides better control over large or strong dogs. It also doesn't reinforce pulling behavior, since the forward action is halted by your continued pressure on the harness.</p><p>A well-fitting harness, especially a three-point style that fits around the body at multiple points, can be helpful for nervous dogs that can back out of a collar or a more simple harness style.</p><p>If your dog has very long fur, however, a harness may be more likely to cause tangles or mats, especially if worn for a prolonged period of time or for intensive activities.</p><p>Some dogs may also need to get used to wearing a harness. It is more tricky to put on and nervous dogs, may not like putting their head through it. In these instances, taking it slow and using treats to build a positive association is recommended.</p><h2> When to Use a Dog Harness Rather Than Just a Collar </h2><p>Every dog should wear a collar for identification purposes, but if you're trying to decide on a harness versus collar for walking and training, take into account your dog's breed and personality, as well as your experience and common scenarios you may encounter. </p><p>Small dogs, those that have suffered from trachael collapse or breeds that are prone to this issue should use a harness. They are also commonly used on flat-faced, brachycephalic breeds, like French Bulldogs and Pugs, that can be prone to respiratory problems.</p><p>Any dog that pulls excessively, however, would benefit from wearing a harness to take the pressure off their neck and stop them from choking while you work on loose-leash walking skills.</p><p>If you are running with your dog or allowing some additional freedom on a long line, a harness is always recommended to avoid them hurting their neck if they build up momentum and reach the end of the leash while traveling at high speeds.</p><p>The bottom line is that no equipment is a substitute for good leash training. If you want a well-behaved dog capable of loose leash walking, you must be prepared to put in the time and effort to achieve the results you are looking for. However, by being informed of the pros and cons of dog collars versus harnesses, you can make the right choice for your pet. </p>",908
111,https://www.thesprucepets.com/sarcoptic-mange-in-puppy-dogs-2804975,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,"<h1>Puppies: Sarcoptic Mange, Diagnosis, and Treatment</h1>","<h1>Puppies: Sarcoptic Mange, Diagnosis, and Treatment</h1><h2>Understanding puppy mange and canine scabies</h2><p> Dr.</p><p>Canine scabies can affect any dog regardless of age, breed, or coat type. It's rare for only one dog in a multi-pet home to exhibit clinical signs. Unlike demodectic mange that is not contagious, sarcoptic mange is so contagious that usually if one animal in a household is affected, all animals are infected.</p><h2> Sarcoptic Mange Life Cycle </h2><p>Sarcoptic mange, also known as canine scabies, is a parasite disease caused by a circular short-legged microscopic mite that burrows into the skin.</p><p>After burrowing, the female mite forms a tunnel and lays three to five eggs daily. Larvae emerge within another three to eight days, and after hatching, those that migrate across the surface of the host animal's skin often will die. But most larvae stay in the tunnel or its extensions (called ""molting pockets"") where they develop into nymphs.</p><p>Some nymphs stay in the original tunnels and molting pockets, while others burrow and form new tunnels. A few wander onto the skin surface to feed and mate, where the potential for transmission to yet another host becomes possible. The next molt produces adult male and female mites. The cycle from egg to adult takes 17 to 21 days. Mites have an average life span of three to four weeks.</p><h2> How Puppies Catch Canine Scabies </h2><p>Mites carrying canine scabies are usually transmitted by direct dog-to-dog contact. The mite lives out its entire life cycle on the dog, but mites can survive up to 48 hours off a host. This means a puppy could pick up the mites simply by sleeping on a blanket used by an infected dog, or by sharing grooming tools like brushes.</p><p>Most dogs develop symptoms about three weeks after exposure. The mite prefers sparsely-furred areas of the body, like the hock, elbow, area surrounding the eyes and muzzle, stomach, ear flap and the root of the tail.</p><h2> Signs of Sarcoptic Mange </h2><p>Burrowing mites produce intense itching which prompts the infected puppy to chew, scratch, and rub the affected areas. The scratch reflex in affected pups can be easily stimulated; by merely manipulating the pinnae (ear flap) the pup will often kick a hind leg in reaction.</p><p>Excessive scratching results in skin inflammation, and red papules and sores and secondary infections often develop. Crusts form on the surface of the affected skin, and as the disease intensifies, the skin thickens.</p><p>Untreated dogs will have dry, deeply wrinkled and thick skin. Damaged skin causes loosened hair to fall out, and the sparseness of hair, in turn, provides the mite with an even better environment in which to proliferate.</p><h2> Diagnosis and Treatment </h2><p>Left untreated, the disease may continue for months to years. Victims with advanced mite infestation become irritable and are restless, and subsequently, begin to lose weight. Diagnosis is based on signs of disease, and on finding the mite in microscopic examination of skin scrapings.</p><h2> Treating Puppies with Mange </h2><p>Scabies can be difficult to diagnose because the mites can be hard to find; only about 30 percent of canine scabies cases actually locate a mite in skin scrapings. For this reason, the condition may be confused with seborrhea, flea allergy, or other skin conditions.</p><p>Treatment is often the best diagnosis. Dogs that respond favorably to therapy are deemed to have scabies. Treatment consists of medication to kill the mites and additional therapies to help with itching and secondary skin infections. There are topical, oral, and injectable miticide treatment options. If a topical medication is selected, clipping the puppy's fur is recommended. </p><p>Several effective scabicides are available from a veterinarian. Multiple treatments over several weeks are generally needed for satisfactory results. Ivermectin, which is the active ingredient in some heartworm preventatives, is also effective against sarcoptic mange. Ivermectin should be avoided in collies, shelties, and related breeds due to risk of toxicity and adverse reaction.</p><p>Secondary infections generally respond to the medicated shampoos and elizabethan collars to prevent further self-trauma, but some cases require oral antibiotics. In severe cases of sarcoptic infection, use of concurrent therapy may be warranted. A high-quality, well-balanced puppy diet for affected pups is important as well.</p><p>Because the condition is so contagious, all dogs and cats in contact with the affected animal should be treated. Some puppies may be carriers of the mite, without ever showing clinical signs themselves.</p><h2> How Puppy Mange Affects People </h2><p>Canine scabies almost exclusively affects dogs, but can also cause skin disease in cats or in people. It most commonly affects owners who allow the pup to sleep in their bed or who hold the pup a great deal.</p><p>In people, the mite causes itching and inflammation, and prolonged exposure may produce sores. However, the mite does not reproduce on people and curing the puppy typically also cures the owner within seven to 28 days following treatment of the affected dog.</p><p>Once cured, dogs are not immune to reinfection. Part of the treatment should include disinfection of the dog's bedding, grooming tools, collar, and carriers, to prevent reinfestation. Reduced exposure to other dogs and vigorous treatment at the earliest warning will keep your puppy free of this disease.</p><h3>Watch Now: All You Need to Know about Puppies</h3>",853
112,https://www.thesprucepets.com/distemper-in-puppies-2804927,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Distemper in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>Distemper in Puppies</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Distemper often strikes puppies exposed to the spreadable virus in shelters, kennels, or other environments where there may already be infected and unvaccinated animals. Decades of effective vaccinations in the canine population has not eradicated this serious disease. Regardless of your dog's age you should be especially vigilant about symptoms, such as eye discharge or nervous system problems.</p><h2> What Is Distemper? </h2><p>Distemper in puppies is a virus similar to human measles that can affect the nervous system. About 50 percent of adult dogs and 80 percent of puppies that develop this disease will die, especially when left untreated. The distemper virus also infects wild animals, such as the wolf, coyote, raccoon, ferret, mink, skunk, otter, and weasel.</p><h2> Symptoms of Distemper in Puppies </h2><p>Early symptoms may look like the puppy has an ordinary cold, but they may be signs of a serious disease. Other symptoms that develop may be more subtle, such as thicker paw skin, or more obvious, such as seizures.</p><p>Incubation is the time it takes from exposure to the development of signs of disease. Within a few days following infection, the virus spreads throughout the body. Whether or not the infected pup survives depends on the effectiveness of the dog's immune system.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3> Discharge From Nose and Eyes </h3><p>Early on in the disease, puppies may have what appears to be a runny nose. The fluid is often a characteristic thick white to yellow discharge from its nose and eyes that looks like a run-of-the-mill cold symptom.</p><h3> Fever </h3><p>A fever usually occurs three to six days after infection. This is because the virus destroys white blood cells resulting in a fever that may last a day or two.</p><h3> Cracked/Thickened Skin </h3><p>The skin, particularly the puppy's footpads, may thicken and crack.</p><h3> Diarrhea and Loss of Appetite </h3><p>The virus can make its way into cells lining the stomach and the intestinal tract, and will possibly appear in the puppy's feces. When the virus has arrived in this area of the puppy's system, it will experience diarrhea and loss of appetite.</p><h3> Trouble Breathing/Coughing </h3><p>Infection of the respiratory system can cause puppies to cough and develop pneumonia.</p><h3> Central Nervous System Issues </h3><p>When the distemper virus has reached the puppy's nervous system, the dog will display symptoms such as seizures, behavioral changes, weakness, and poor coordination.</p><h2> Causes of Distemper </h2><p>Distemper is highly contagious and often fatal. The virus is shed in the saliva, respiratory secretions, urine, and feces. Distemper spreads between animals the same way a virus might spread among people -by sneezing and coughing.</p><p>Pups adopted from stressful places like animal shelters, rescues, and pet stores, or homeless pets are the most likely to contract the disease, especially those younger than four months of age. Puppies can look healthy during the incubation period of the disease-even after vaccination-and become sick once in their new home.</p><h2> Diagnosing Distemper in Puppies </h2><p>Unvaccinated puppies found in shelters or pet stores may be misdiagnosed with common kennel cough instead of distemper. Obvious clinical symptoms will usually alert a veterinarian to the presence of distemper. However, additional blood, tissue, and nasal/eye swab diagnostic tests can help test for the virus and confirm the diagnosis.</p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>There is no cure for the distemper virus. Pups with severe symptoms usually die within a few weeks, unless hospitalized and given supportive care. Owners can provide some nursing care at home.</p><p>Sick dogs that may have less severe symptoms can be given medicine but no single treatment is specific or always effective. It may take ongoing therapy for up to several weeks to conquer the disease in your puppy.</p><h2> Prognosis for Puppies With Distemper </h2><p>Each puppy responds differently to treatment. For some, the symptoms get better and then worsen before recovery. Others show no improvement despite aggressive treatment. Consult with your veterinarian before making the heartbreaking decision to euthanize a sick puppy.</p><p>Dogs that survive infection during puppyhood may suffer enamel hypoplasia-poorly developed tooth enamel that's pitted and discolored. Even dogs that recover from infection may suffer permanent damage to the central nervous system that results in recurrent seizures or other neurological signs for the rest of the dog's life. Protect your puppy with preventive vaccinations, as recommended by your veterinarian, and prevent contact with other unvaccinated dogs and wildlife.</p><h2> How to Prevent Distemper </h2><p>Distemper is one puppy disease for which there is a vaccine. By far, the simplest and most effective way to prevent distemper is to adhere to the prescribed vaccination schedule for your puppy. The distemper vaccine is part of the DHPP combination vaccine; the letters stand for distemper, hepatitis, parainfluenza, and parvovirus.</p><h2> Is Distemper Contagious to Other Animals? </h2><p>As mentioned, distemper is highly contagious, even by a puppy recovering from the virus. A recovering puppy will shed the virus for weeks or months, which can still infect other healthy dogs. Sick or recovering dogs must be quarantined away from healthy animals. The virus can be killed on surfaces by using a disinfectant such as household bleach.</p>",846
113,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-development-from-newborn-to-one-week-4588125,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Development From Newborn to One Week Old</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Development From Newborn to One Week Old</h1><p>The birth of puppies is an exciting time. It's beautiful to watch a mother care for her newborns, especially in the early stages of life.</p><p>A newborn puppy is completely helpless and dependent upon its mother. The first week of a puppy's life is mainly about sleeping and eating so it will grow.</p><p>Puppies should remain with their mother and littermates until about age eight to 12 weeks. However, it is most crucial to have a mother during the first few weeks of life. A puppy that has been separated from its mother will need human intervention. Raising a newborn puppy takes a lot of time and intensive care. This is not quite the same thing as caring for a young puppy.</p><h2> Physical Development </h2><p>Puppies are born with closed eyes and ears. They cannot see and can hear very little, if at all. Yet they are able to make noise, which sounds like high-pitched squealing. They have no teeth at birth and are unable to walk. Newborn puppies are incapable of urinating or defecating on their own. In addition, a newborn puppy cannot regulate its own body temperature.</p><p>Most newborn puppies are instinctively able to find their mother's nipples and begin nursing right after they are born, or whelped. Once cleaned up (by mom or a helping human hand) they will crawl towards the mother's warm belly, find the teats, and begin to suckle.</p><h3>Fun Fact</h3><p>With proper food intake and mothering care, a newborn puppy should double its weight in the first 10 days of its life.</p><h2> Behavior Changes </h2><p>Newborn puppies will spend about 90% of the time sleeping for the first few weeks of life. That's more than 22 hours a day, but sleep doesn't happen all at once. Pups will nap on and off throughout the day and night, keeping warm with littermates and the mother's body heat. In between naps, they spend the rest of the time eating and being groomed by mom. Newborn puppies eat about every two hours or more.</p><p>Because newborn puppies cannot see, hear, or walk, they do not have much exploring to do early on. The puppy's world is all about mom, littermates, and the box they all sleep in.</p><h2> Health and Care </h2><p>During the first few weeks of a puppy's life, the mother dog spends the majority of her time providing food and care. The mother keeps her puppies clean and nurses them. She licks the anus and genitals of each puppy to stimulate urination and defecation. During this time, humans can gently hold and pet the puppies for brief periods as long as this does not seem to upset the mother dog. It's more likely for human contact to be welcomed if those humans are part of the mother dog's family.</p><p>In general, it's best to let mom do her job and stick to just petting the puppies. However, there are situations where the mother is unwilling or unable to care for her pups. Or, mom might be doing a fine job, but one or more puppies are not growing properly. This is when human intervention is the only possible way to save the puppies. If you decide to care for an orphaned puppy, be prepared to spend most of your time with the puppy for the next few weeks.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Any time a puppy is not gaining weight well or becomes orphaned, that puppy should be taken to a vet as soon as possible to assess her health. Puppies can get very sick very quickly without proper care. When in doubt about the health of a puppy, do not delay the vet visit!</p><p>If the puppy was rejected by her mother, it may be due to a health issue detected by the mother. In the meantime, you will need to do your best to provide the care her mother would have.</p><h2> Food and Nutrition </h2><p>In general, a newborn puppy gets all the nutrition it needs from its mother's milk. The first milk made by the mother contains colostrum, a substance that contains additional antibodies to help the puppy fight infection. This can be absorbed by the puppy for the first day or two of life and provides some temporary immunity against whatever illnesses the mother has immunity against.</p><p>Be aware that commercial puppy formula will not provide colostrum. Bottle-fed puppies that do not get colostrum are especially vulnerable to illness and may not thrive. A veterinarian may be able to administer serum from another dog to the puppy within the first 24 hours of its life to mimic the effects of colostrum.</p><p>Newborn puppies will not have teeth for several weeks and are unable to digest puppy food. Do not introduce any kind of dog food until the puppies are ready to begin the weaning process, usually around 3-4 weeks of age, unless it is otherwise recommended by a veterinarian.</p><h2> Training and Socialization </h2><p>A newborn puppy is too young to go through any kind of training, but there may be some things you can do to get her used to people and her environment. If the mother permits it, handle the puppies regularly for a short time. Take care not to keep the pup away from mom for more than a few minutes. You can use the time to cuddle and pet the puppy, acquainting her with the smell and feel of humans and the environment.</p>",893
114,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-teething-2804965,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Teething Timeline: What to Expect</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Teething Timeline: What to Expect</h1><p>Just like human babies,  puppies have baby teeth that fall out. Most puppies are born without teeth and go through a process known as puppy teething. From birth to six months, sharp puppy teeth erupt from the gums in the jaw in a predictable timeline. Puppies go through teething stages during the development of their teeth, including sore gums, and eventually-the eruption of 28 baby teeth. During teething, puppies may target all kinds of unexpected objects to gnaw and chew on, like baseboards and shoes, to relieve the discomfort. However, most dogs never outgrow the urge to chew. Pet owners are encouraged to learn about how their puppy's teeth grow in so they can best handle their dog as it ages.</p><h3>Watch Now: Puppy Teething Basics</h3><h2> Birth to 2 Weeks </h2><h2> Weeks 2 to 4 </h2><p>In the front of the mouth, narrow-edged teeth known as incisors will begin to emerge. The incisors are the first to appear at about two to three weeks of age. Puppies have six incisors on both the top and bottom jaw.</p><p>Premolars and molars also begin to grow behind canines (the pointed teeth between the incisors and premolars) at three to six weeks of age, with three on the top and bottom of each side. Four needle-like canines appear at age four weeks and frame the incisors, one on each side, top, and bottom.</p><h2> Weeks 5 to 8 </h2><p>The last molars appear by six to eight weeks of age. At about eight weeks, the puppy's permanent teeth begin pushing out deciduous or ""milk teeth."" The roots of the baby teeth are absorbed by the body, and in most cases, milk teeth simply fall out.</p><p>When the deciduous teeth don't fall out on time, puppies may appear to have a double set of teeth. Retained baby teeth should be extracted by a veterinarian so that permanent teeth have room to grow. Sometimes, a crowded mouth pushes teeth out of alignment, resulting in difficulty eating or poor dental hygiene (which can lead to periodontal disease).</p><p>All of your puppy's 28 baby teeth are expected to come in by this time. This is when puppies start to learn how to eat moist and soft puppy food.</p><h2> Weeks 12 to 16 </h2><p>Breeders often let their puppies go to their new owners' homes around eight weeks. Baby teeth will begin to shed, and permanent adult teeth will start to come in. This process is painful for dogs, so providing puppy safe chew toys is recommended. This is a good time to socialize your dog more, look and touch the inside and outside of its mouth, and prepare for teeth brushing.</p><h2> 6 Months and Older </h2><p>At this point, all puppy teeth should be gone, and adult teeth emerge. If there are any baby teeth left, let your vet know so it can be removed. Permanent teeth replace the milk teeth tooth-for-tooth and add four premolars and 10 molars. Most pups will have 42 permanent teeth in place by about seven months of age.</p><h2> Signs to Keep an Eye on During Teething </h2><p>While it can vary somewhat between breeds, there is a progression you can expect as your puppy develops new teeth. It's important to begin handling your puppy's mouth while it's young so you can periodically check for any potential tooth problems. Any type of facial swelling, changes in eating habits, unexpected night awakenings, or rubbing of the face are signs of possible oral discomfort.</p><h2> How to Keep Teeth Healthy </h2><p>Schedule a visit with your veterinarian for an initial dental exam for your puppy. This examination will include a look at the teeth, gums, and oral cavity. Ask your vet to demonstrate how to clean your pup's teeth. This way, you'll know what brushes, toothpaste, and techniques to use.</p><p>Get your pup used to the idea of tooth brushing around six months when its adult teeth start to come in. Regular brushing will prevent plaque, stinky breath, disease, and other medical problems. It's ideal to brush your puppy's teeth daily, but once or twice a week will work.</p><h2> The Purpose of Each Dog Tooth </h2><p>Different kinds of teeth serve various functions, based on the position of the mouth and the shape of the tooth. With some breeds, the shape of the jaw impacts how each type of tooth functions. Most dogs have V-shaped upper and lower jaws which allow the mouth to be opened very wide for grasping and capturing prey-or grabbing and holding toys during play.</p><h2> What a Proper Bite Looks Like </h2><p>When the mouth is closed, dogs should have a normal ""bite."" This is very important so that dogs can eat and use their mouth normally (and is judged accordingly in show dogs).</p><p>Malocclusion refers to the abnormal ""bite"" or fitting of these teeth. Malocclusion can be normal for certain dog breeds due to differences in the shape of the jaw and mouth. For instance, the flat-faced (brachycephalic) dog breeds like Bulldogs have a normal malocclusion because their lower jaw is longer than the upper. However, this allows the teeth to fit incorrectly, which can cause mouth damage as the dog chews. Thus, a veterinarian or veterinary dentist with orthodontic correction should be aware of malocclusion.</p>",853
115,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-prevent-destructive-puppy-behavior-1117888,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Stop Chewing in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Chewing in Puppies</h1><p>For puppies, the entire world is a chew toy. Puppies, like babies, explore the world with their mouths. Unfortunately, their explorations are not limited to their own toys. Your shoes, furniture, children's toys, and anything else lying around your house are fair game for a teething puppy.</p><p>Unfortunately, your puppy may chew things that can harm it. You can put a stop to your puppy's destructive behavior, but It takes time and consistent training.</p><h2> Why Do Puppies Chew? </h2><p>Most of the time, chewing is normal behavior for puppies and dogs, and it serves many purposes, such as strengthening their jaws and relieving anxiety.</p><p>Like babies, puppies experience discomfort while teething, and gnawing or chewing on things provides some relief. Boredom is another reason that puppies chew. Dogs are social animals and need stimulation for their mental health. If you're not exercising your pup enough or giving it sufficient one-on-one time, it may seek attention by chewing inappropriate objects.</p><h2> How to Stop Destructive Chewing </h2><p>There aren't many medical conditions other than teething that cause a puppy to chew on things, but it's worth a trip to the vet just to be sure. If the vet gives your puppy a clean bill of health, there are several ways to prevent your puppy from wrecking your abode.</p><h2> Puppy-Proof Your Home </h2><p>Puppies should not have the full run of your home until they are completely trained. Many people choose to use the kitchen since it's easier to clean up accidents on an uncarpeted floor.</p><p>Once you've decided on the areas where your puppy will be allowed to play, take a good look around and begin puppy-proofing. Pick up or move any objects that your puppy might decide to chew. Get down at the dog's level to see what might appeal to it. Remove or cover any electrical wires, houseplants, garbage pails, children's toys, and anything else you don't want your puppy to chew or knock over.</p><h2> Crate Train Your Puppy </h2><p>While crate training is usually talked about in terms of house training, it is also a good tool for curbing destructive puppies. When you're not able to supervise your puppy, crating can keep it and your home safe. If you don't have a crate, you can confine the dog to a small, puppy-proof room such as a bathroom or kitchen.</p><h2> Provide Your Puppy with Toys </h2><p>Chewing allows puppies to ease teething pain, and it alleviates boredom. To prevent your puppy from getting in the habit of inappropriate chewing, make sure you provide it with lots of appropriate things to chew on.</p><p>Toys that work well for puppies are rubber toys with a hollow center, stuffed animals with squeakers inside, and nylon bones. Avoid animal bones, hooves, and antlers.</p><p>Don't give your puppy old shoes or socks as playthings; you're likely to cause confusion between which shoes are OK for chewing and which ones are off-limits.</p><p>There is some controversy over the safety of items like rawhides, pig's ears, and other edible chews. Be sure to talk to your veterinarian before giving any of these items to your puppy.</p><h2> Rotate Your Puppy's Toys </h2><p>Since puppies chew to alleviate boredom, it's a good idea to rotate your puppy's toys every few days. A puppy will be looking for something new and interesting to sink its teeth into. By changing its toys around periodically, you'll be keeping it interested in the things you want it to chew, and it will be less likely to start gnawing on the kitchen cabinets.</p><h2> Offer a Swap </h2><p>Try giving your puppy a treat in exchange for whatever inappropriate object it has in its mouth. This is a good way to train your dog to learn the command ""give"" if you repeat it before giving the treat. Over time, your puppy should learn that ""give"" means ""give me that thing in your mouth!""</p><p>Just take care not to lavish your puppy with praise when it swaps the inappropriate object for a treat. You don't want to turn it into a game where your puppy expects a reward for chewing on the wrong things.</p><h2> Redirect Your Puppy </h2><p>When you see your puppy begin to chew on something inappropriate, don't scold it. Instead, move the puppy away from the object and redirect it to something you want it to chew. Make your puppy's toy more interesting by squeezing a squeaky toy or shaking a bone while talking to it in a happy tone of voice. Give the pup lots of praise for chewing its toys.</p><p>If you think your puppy is teething, you can give it a doggy version of a teething ring: Dampen a washcloth; then place it in the freezer for about an hour. Give it to your puppy to tug and chew on, allowing the cold to soothe its sore gums.</p><h2> Give Your Puppy Plenty of Exercise </h2><p>A tired puppy is a happy puppy. Be sure to give your puppy enough playtime and cuddle time. If it's had all of its puppy vaccinations, make walks part of your dog's daily routine. If left to its own devices, your puppy is going to start looking for ways to burn off energy. This leads to destructive behavior. A puppy who gets regular exercise is much more likely to be well behaved.</p>",879
116,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kennel-cough-in-puppies-2804935,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Kennel Cough in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>Kennel Cough in Puppies</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Kennel cough is a common and highly contagious condition affecting puppies and adult dogs. Brought on by bacteria or viruses, the disease causes inflammation of the dog's trachea and bronchi (the tubes leading to the lungs). All dogs are susceptible, but the disease is most common in dogs exposed to crowded conditions, like those found in boarding kennels, doggy daycare, animal shelters, dog shows, bad breeders, or other stressful conditions.</p><h2> What Is Kennel Cough? </h2><p>Kennel cough, also known as canine infectious respiratory disease complex or canine infectious tracheobronchitis, is a contagious disease that causes inflammation of the dog's trachea and bronchi, the tubes leading to the lungs.</p><p>Infectious bacterial or viral agents damage the cilia (tiny hair-like projections) within an infected dog's airways, causing a cough. Cilia normally protect the respiratory tract by clearing away irritants like dust, bacteria, and other microorganisms with wave-like motions. When they are damaged, the protective mechanism breaks down, which increases the chances that one or more infections will develop.</p><p>Kennel cough got its name from one of the most likely sources of disease transmission: crowded boarding kennels.</p><h2> Symptoms of Kennel Cough in Puppies </h2><p>Most cases of kennel cough cause mild disease, with symptoms that tend to be more aggravating to owners than dangerous to the puppy. However, if left untreated, kennel cough can develop into life-threatening pneumonia.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Kennel cough causes inflammation of the pup's trachea and bronchi, resulting in a telltale cough that often sounds like a high-pitched honking. The cough can be prompted by excitement, drinking, or gentle pressure applied to the base of the puppy's throat. Leash tugging may result in coughing, too. Nasal or eye discharge, fever, and loss of appetite are less common symptoms and are more likely to appear if the disease progresses, untreated.</p><p>Symptoms of a kennel cough infection usually develop between two and 10 days following exposure, which is another good reason to quarantine new puppies.</p><h2> Causes of Kennel Cough </h2><p>Kennel cough spreads through the saliva and nasal secretions. It can happen through direct contact when your puppy sniffs or licks an infected dog or a contaminated object in their environment. However, coughing also transmits the agents through the air from one dog to another.</p><h2> Diagnosing Kennel Cough in Puppies </h2><p>Your vet will diagnose kennel cough based on your pup's recent history and clinical signs. For instance, if your puppy was recently adopted from a shelter or kennel-or spent time at a boarding facility-those are all risk factors. In most cases, it's not important to identify the infectious agent responsible for a dog's symptoms, but tests can be run if that becomes necessary.</p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>Kennel cough can develop into a vicious cycle. The infection causes irritation that prompts a cough, which then causes even more irritation. Mild cases may resolve at home with rest and nursing care, but if a puppy's symptoms are severe or fail to improve relatively rapidly, veterinary care will be necessary.</p><p>Antibiotics may be required when bacterial infections are involved. Anti-inflammatory drugs and bronchodilators (which open breathing passages) may also be prescribed. If pneumonia develops, your dog will need more aggressive treatment.</p><h3> Home Care </h3><p>When your puppy suffers from congestion, there are home remedies to soothe its symptoms during convalescence.</p><p>Refusing to eat and drink can make a puppy even sicker. Ask your vet about offering pungent and more tempting foods to spark a sick pup's appetite. Warm the food for five seconds in the microwave to just below body temperature-about 95 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit. That will unlock the aroma so the food smells more pungent and penetrates even a stuffy nose.</p><p>Moisture also helps enhance the aroma, so try adding a bit of warm water or chicken broth to your dog's regular food. If your puppy's appetite doesn't improve within 24 hours, call your veterinarian.</p><h2> Prognosis </h2><p>With attentive care, puppies generally recover from kennel cough within a few weeks. Severe cases present the risk of pneumonia, which is a more serious condition and can be dangerous, requiring intensive veterinary care to avoid critical illness or death.</p><p>Because kennel cough is highly contagious to other dogs, it is important to isolate a sick pup (or one that is coughing regularly) from other canines and watch for coughing in those that have been exposed. Infected pups may remain contagious to other dogs for several weeks, so isolation can be challenging in multi-dog households.</p><h2> Prevention </h2><p>Protective vaccinations against kennel cough are available. Some vaccinations are given by injection, while others are given as drops in the nose or mouth to stimulate what's known as a ""local immunity."" Your veterinarian can advise you on the best option for your dog. Dogs at high risk for kennel cough may benefit from annual vaccinations; otherwise, this vaccine may only be administered before your puppy can be boarded at a kennel or attend puppy classes.</p><h2> Is Kennel Cough Contagious to Other Animals? </h2><p>Kennel cough is highly contagious to other canines, so an infected puppy should be isolated from other dogs of all ages. This disease is not contagious to humans or other pet species.</p>",853
117,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dealing-with-a-puppy-in-pain-2804938,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Help a Puppy in Pain</h1>,"<h1>How to Help a Puppy in Pain</h1><p>Puppy pain can seem hidden if the signs don't look like what you'd expect. How dogs show pain differs based on their personalities and on the type of injury or illness. A puppy may react differently to an injured paw pad compared to a tummy ache or ear infection, for example.</p><h2> How Puppies Show Pain </h2><p>The most common signs of discomfort include vocalizations when touched in a painful place. Pups whimper, whine, cry, or yelp. They may flinch, avoid contact, hold up an injured leg or limp, and/or seek attention.</p><p>There are many other ways that dogs show pain as well. This can range from pacing or becoming agitated, panting or drooling, or even refusing to eat. A puppy with a 'hunched posture' is likely in pain too; whether that is from a painful abdomen, a back injury, or another cause takes further investigation but should be a warning that something is wrong.</p><p>Dogs will also show pain related to eye and ear injuries. Most often, dogs with painful eyes will squint and rub at their eyes. Earaches may cause the puppy to tilt her head to the hurting side, or rub her ear against the furniture or ground.</p><p>When something on the inside of the puppy aches, such as pain in the belly or on the limbs, the puppy may lick that area in an effort to relieve the pain.</p><p>A dog that is in pain may avoid interaction and look for a place to be alone. Sometimes they have a worried expression as well as flattened ears and low tail carriage.</p><h2> Kinds of Pain </h2><p>Pain tolerances vary from pet to pet, just as in people. Some dogs will hide their pain until it is unbearable, so you can't always tell just how serious something is by your dog's reaction. If a condition would be painful in a person, you should assume it's also painful for your puppy.</p><p>While there are many different causes for pain, there are two primary types of pain in the body. One is called , and is the result of inflammation of any tissues within the body. The other is which occurs from direct inflammation of nerve tissue. In either case, the signs your dog shows for pain may be the same and may include any of the signs listed above. Since the signs may be vague, it is important to get your dog to the vet anytime it is showing these signs.</p><h2> How Pain Works </h2><p>How exactly does pain work? Damaged tissue releases chemicals that sensitize nerve endings. Aggravated nerves send pain signals up to the spinal cord to the brain. The brain recognizes the sensation and shouts, ""Dang, that smarts!"" and triggers a reaction.</p><p>Extreme and chronic pain, though, cause a more complicated response that can lead to damaging side effects including depressed immune function, trouble sleeping, and cardiovascular effects. Extreme and chronic pain can also permanently rewire neural pathways to create a ""pain memory"" that keeps pets feeling pain long after the injury has healed.</p><h2> Pain Management for Dogs </h2><p>Luckily, pain management is a very important part of veterinary care and there are many safe and effective drugs and treatments available depending on your dog's condition.</p><p>Some of the most common pain medications prescribed by veterinarians are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These drugs can be very effective at reducing inflammation, and therefore pain, for many common painful conditions. There are many safe NSAIDs labeled for use in dogs and your veterinarian can guide you to the best option.</p><p>Dogs with chronic, or nerve-associated pain may also benefit from drugs used specifically for these purposes. These include drugs like Gabapentin, and Amantadine.</p><p>Narcotic pain relievers may be used for severe pain, or in cases when an NSAID is not a safe choice for a dog. These include buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, and codeine, and are available only by prescription. Many of these drugs are used before, during, and right after surgery since they are very potent. They may be delivered through an IV in these case. Sometimes these medications are also given to outpatients when needed, and they may be provided in a pill, liquid, or even as a ""pain patch"" that can deliver the medication transdermally, through the skin.</p><p>It is always important to remember that human pain medicines may be toxic to pets, so never give your pet medication unless it is was prescribed for them. Pain control options from your veterinarian are always the best and safest choice for pets since they address the specific type of pain as well as the age and even breed of your pup.</p><p>In some cases, dogs benefit from a multi-modal approach to pain management, which means that drugs are used in combination with other therapies. Some of these additional therapies may include acupuncture, massage, physical rehabilitation exercises, swim therapy, therapeutic laser and/or joint supplements.</p><p>There are so many effective ways to help control pain in dogs and every dog will respond differently to certain drugs and therapies. If one approach is not working, be sure to contact your vet and don't get discouraged if it takes time to find the best option for your pooch. It will be worth it when that tail wag returns and your pooch is back to its playful self!</p>",875
118,https://www.thesprucepets.com/crying-puppy-sounds-2804562,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>What Different Puppy Sounds Mean</h1>,"<h1>What Different Puppy Sounds Mean</h1><h2>Barking, howling, and growling, oh my!</h2><p>When your crying puppy drives you crazy with whimpers, yelps, barks, and howls, how can you understand all those puppy sounds? Canine communication helps reinforce your puppy's social position within his family. Puppy talk may invite you to come closer or warn to keep away. It can be confusing because puppies use barks and growls during play as well as when they mean business.</p><p>Most often, vocalizations punctuate what the body movements are saying in the same way people use inflection to impart emotion and meaning. And because dogs realize people rely on verbal communication, our pets have become much more vocal than their ancestors.</p><h2> Barking </h2><p>Barking is rare in wolves, but it's the most common vocal signal in dogs. It's used during play, defense, and as a greeting. Barks are categorized as a dominance signal. But that does not mean barking necessarily equals aggression.</p><p>Barking is a canine fire alarm, a call to action that alerts the family group to the unusual. This may be anything from the arrival of friend or foe, to an unexpected sound like thunder, or the strange sight of you wearing a hat. Some dogs bark to relieve boredom, particularly when left alone for hours at a time, and dogs can be taught to stop barking.</p><p>But dogs won't stop barking any more than people would cease talking to express themselves. Dogs also bark together as a joyful expression of happiness; that's why yelling at a dog to stop barking rarely works-he thinks you're joining in a communal bark-fest, and barks even louder. You won't stop puppy barking altogether, but you could follow tips to reduce it. </p><h2> Howls </h2><p>Dogs use howls to express emotion and to announce their location to missing pack members. Usually, a howl is a canine cry of loneliness that implores others to come join him. Puppies left home alone or sequestered by themselves in a room may howl.</p><p>Some puppy breeds howl more than others. These include Northern-type dog breeds such as Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies that may be closer to wolf forebears than others. Hound breeds also tend to howl more often since they were bred to ""bay"" as a way to announce their tracking or hunting progress in the field.</p><p>Howls seem to be contagious, with a single lone call often answered by any other dog within hearing. Dogs may interpret a siren as a howl, and respond with an enthusiastic reply. My German shepherd, Magic, howls along whenever I sing-maybe he's a critic, or perhaps he simply wants to join in the happy chorus.</p><h2> Whines, Whimpers, and Yelps </h2><p>Whines, whimpers, and yelps communicate submission, pain or fear. The actual meaning depends on what the rest of the body ""says."" When your puppy vocalizes with whines, whimpers or yelps while trying to keep her distance from you or some other situation, the sounds indicate fear. Puppy injury often gets announced with repeated yelps, and holding up or favoring the hurt paw.</p><p>But whines, whimpers, and yelps also are used as solicitations to a dominant individual (usually the owner). In other words, your baby uses these techniques to beg for attention, food, or to go in or out.</p><h2> Growls and Snarls </h2><p>Growls and snarls are warnings. Dogs use these as distance-increasing signals to tell others to back off and stay away.</p><p>Snarls display the teeth and aren't always accompanied by sound; they signify slight fear. Growls indicate deeper concern and can be made with the mouth open or closed. A dog's growl is used in defense and as a threat. They often are used during play when your puppy attacks a toy or wrestles with other pups.</p><p>While a threatening growl and snarl can be scary, these sounds can be very important communication tools for your pup and to you. Puppies taught to never growl are more likely to bite without warning. That makes it especially important for all pups to learn proper bite inhibition. It's important for your puppy to snarl and growl in appropriate circumstances-during play, when frightened or in pain-so you have fair warning and can adjust your own behavior accordingly.</p><h2> Laughing </h2><p>Yes, dogs laugh! It doesn't sound exactly how you'd expect, either. And while puppies and dogs use the other whines, growls, and barks in other contexts, the dog laugh appears to happen only during play.</p><p>A dog laugh sounds similar to a human saying, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha!"" but without sounding the ""a"" vowel. It's simply a breathy exhalation, according to researcher P.R. Simonet. There's also research that points to a dog sneeze in certain circumstances as being similar to a ""canine giggle"" of delight.</p><p>Recordings of the panting-laugh sound played at shelters have helped calm dogs' stress. Sneezing can prompt a reciprocal sneeze in your puppy, too-because after all, laughter is catching and good medicine. Try it!</p><h2> Mixed Signals </h2><p>Puppies aren't always sure how they feel. They can mix up vocal signals and make it difficult for owners to understand what they mean. Puppies that aren't sure how they feel may bark, whimper, snarl, and yelp all at the same time. That usually means they're more scared than aggressive. By learning to understand what your puppy says, you can help prevent dog bites and ensure you maintain a great relationship.</p>",870
119,https://www.thesprucepets.com/when-to-take-puppy-to-vet-2804724,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>When to Take Your Puppy to The Vet</h1>,"<h1>When to Take Your Puppy to The Vet</h1><h2>Be Aware of Your Puppy's Health</h2><p>Whether this is your first puppy or your tenth puppy, it is important to know when it is time to take your puppy to the veterinarian. Be sure to understand what behavior is normal for a puppy so that you know when your puppy's health has deviated from the norm.</p><p>Let's start by saying that you should not seek veterinary advice from anyone who does not have the title Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM, VMD) attached to their name. Even very experienced breeders, trainers, groomers or pet sitters are not qualified to give you veterinary medical advice. You are wise to seek your veterinarian's advice if someone tells you that, in their experience, they do not think something is 'normal'. The information in this article was provided by Darcy Schofil, DVM and Alison Williams, DVM of Cahaba Mountain Brook Animal Clinic. You can trust their advice!</p><p>Here are examples of when to call the veterinarian. </p><h2> Before Using Human Medicine </h2><p>Schofil advises you to resist the temptation to reach for human medicine to treat your puppy. She says that the dosage is very different for a puppy than for a human. Common medicines that we take are often toxic for your puppy. Avoid giving your puppy Tylenol, Advil, ibuprofen, and other similar medications as these can be fatal if ingested by dogs. While you need some at-home remedies in your puppy's first aid kit, check with your veterinarian for the proper doses and safety guidelines before giving anything to your puppy.</p><p>Schofil also advises you to refrain from giving your puppy medications that are left over from a previous prescription unless your veterinarian advises you to use them. For example, giving your puppy eye drops prescribed for conjunctivitis might make a different kind of eye injury worse. It is always best to consult your veterinarian before giving your puppy any medication.</p><h2> Non-Weight Bearing Limping Issues </h2><p>Your puppy is susceptible to the same injuries that you are. Schofil says that if you notice your puppy limping, determine if she bears any weight on the affected leg. A non-weight-bearing limp is a reason to seek immediate veterinary attention. If your puppy is putting weight on her leg, restrict her activity for 24 hours. Contact your veterinarian if the limp persists longer than 24 hours.</p><h2> Coughing, Sneezing or Breathing Issues </h2><p>Persistent coughing or sneezing is a reason to call the vet. Schofil reminds us to also look for any signs of difficulty breathing which may include wheezing, rapid breathing, a bluish tint to gums and lips, and/or open-mouth breathing not related to strenuous exercise. An allergic reaction can cause swelling around the nose and mouth that can also result in trouble breathing. Brachycephalic or 'flat-faced' breeds are often more likely to experience respiratory distress than longer nose breeds. It is important to discuss what is normal for your puppy with your veterinarian when it comes to breathing and know the signs of distress.</p><h2> Changes in Appearance or Behavior  </h2><p>Take the time to teach your puppy to accept handling and gentle restraint. The puppy that trusts you to examine her makes it easier to discover potential issues.</p><p>The sooner you notice a problem and seek veterinary care, the sooner your puppy can recover.</p><h2> Changes in Appetite  </h2><p>It is important to feed your puppy on a schedule. This allows you to notice immediately if she stops eating. Keeping the bowl full can prevent you from knowing if your puppy is experiencing a loss of appetite. If a loss of appetite persists for longer than 12 hours, Schofil says it's time to call your veterinarian.</p><p>Schofil also advises to pay attention to other signs as combinations of symptoms will require faster veterinary intervention. For example, skipping a meal but remaining energetic and playful is very different from skipping a meal and being lethargic. Schofil says this is particularly true when your puppy is experience vomiting and/or diarrhea. If your puppy is energetic and playful, you can wait 24 hours before taking her to the vet. If she is lethargic, weak, or painful, then you should consider vomiting and diarrhea an emergency.</p><h2> Changes in Bathroom Habits  </h2><p>Williams advises you to monitor your puppy's bathroom habits. Call your vet if you notice worms in your pup's stool or diarrhea. It is important for you to know how many bowel movements your puppy typically has in a day-two to three is typically considered normal. Also be aware of how much water your puppy drinks and how frequently she urinates. Being aware of what is normal for your puppy alerts you to potential issues when the pattern changes.</p><h2> When in Doubt, Call the Vet </h2><p>When you are in doubt about your puppy's health, both Williams and Schofil say to contact your veterinarian. It is far better to overreact than to under-react. They urge you to take out health insurance for your puppy. They also remind you to trust veterinary websites and advice over well-meaning people who are not veterinarians.</p>",836
120,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-crate-train-puppy-2805067,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Crate Training Your Puppy</h1>,"<h1>Crate Training Your Puppy</h1><p>There are a number of reasons to crate train your dog. Most puppies and adult dogs feel more secure in a small, enclosed den-like area, and young puppies are especially eager to find a safe place. A carefully-chosen crate and proper crate training can help your puppy discover that a crate is a safe, happy place to spend the night. A youngster should be introduced slowly to the crate when possible and not left unattended longer than the dog is able to ""hold it"" for potty training. But crate training, when it's done right, can give both you and your dog a feeling of order and security in a complex world.</p><h3>Watch Now: How to Crate Train Your Puppy</h3><h2> Consider the Goals of Crate Training </h2><p>Crate training serves a number of purposes, all of which can make your home and your dog's life easier. So already knowing about and accepting a crate should be part of your puppy's training.</p><h2> Select the Ideal Crate </h2><p>The perfect crate should be just large enough for a puppy to go inside, turn around, and lie down to sleep, but not so large that your dog can soil one side of the crate and sleep on the other side. Of course, puppies grow. So take into account your pup's future adult size before investing in a pricey dog crate. Large crates are available with partitions for you to ""shrink"" to puppy size, and then enlarge the area as your puppy grows. You can also purchase an adult-size crate, and insert a barrier like a plastic storage box that shrinks the space to puppy proportions until your pet grows into its crate. </p><p>Most crates are made of solid hard plastic or wire mesh; there are advantages to each. While soft-sided pet carriers work great for transport, they may be too small and prove too tempting for chew-aholic pups to work well for safe confinement. Solid plastic crates are generally opaque, so your dog won't be able to see much once it's inside. This can be either a plus or a minus, depending on your dog's need for privacy and the type of household it lives in. Plastic crates are a must if you plan to travel by air: airlines will not allow you to transport your dog in a metal crate. Wire crates offer plenty of air and visibility and are easy to clean. They can also be folded down and put away when not in use, which is a terrific feature for a smaller home. </p><h2> Introduce the Crate </h2><p>Make the crate a familiar item. While well-adjusted puppies tend to be curious, some tend toward shyness. Anything new prompts suspicion. So make the crate ""part of the furniture"" and set it out in the family room for your new puppy to explore. Leave the door open and let the pup sniff it inside and out.</p><h2> Set up the Crate </h2><p>You want to make the crate a happy place. Place a snuggly blanket or dog bed inside. Or you can toss a toy inside, and encourage your pup to go get it. You want your dog to have positive experiences with the crate. Another idea is to find a puzzle toy that can be stuffed with a smelly, tasty treat. This should be a treat your puppy loves, but can only enjoy when inside the crate.</p><h2> Teach Crate Tolerance </h2><h2> Extend Crate Time </h2><p>Over a week's period or so, increase the length of time that the puppy stays inside the crate with the treat toy. In between training periods, just leave the door open. You might be surprised how often a worn-out puppy seeks out crate time on its own for a nap or to get away from the rest of the household.</p><p>Once your puppy accepts the crate as a fact of puppy life, you can move the crate to a more acceptable spot in the house. A place next to your own bed will let the puppy sleep in its own spot but near your familiar smells and presence. That also offers you a more private area to seclude it, when necessary, from activities in the living area or kitchen that might keep your dog overstimulated.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Ideally, your puppy will welcome and even enjoy spending time in the crate. One common mistake is to use the puppy's crate as the place of punishment because this makes it more difficult for the puppy to consider it a pleasant experience.</p><p>Still, some puppies may have a harder time adjusting to the crate than others. Another common mistake is to expect your pup to love the crate right away. If your new pet is really crate-averse, try a new type of crate. Some dogs may prefer wire crates so they can still see their environment, while others may be the exact opposite. Also, try putting the crate in a different place. Some dogs may prefer their crate in the center of the family action while others might like it in a quieter corner of the house.</p>",839
121,https://www.thesprucepets.com/train-a-puppy-to-come-2805081,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Train Your Puppy to Come When Called</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Puppy to Come When Called</h1><p>Training your puppy to come when called is a basic command that all dogs should learn. It not only promotes polite behavior, but it can also save your puppy's life. Curious puppies get into trouble without constant supervision. Even when you watching, that teasing squirrel can tempt your pup to run into oncoming traffic before you can stop it.</p><h3>Watch Now: How to Train Your Dog to Come</h3><p>A recall-coming when called-allows owners to prevent trouble, even from a distance. No matter their size, puppies travel faster on four pudgy paws than people, so there's no way to catch them. In fact, chasing a puppy becomes a racing game you won't win. When you teach your dog to obey the ""come"" command they will stay safely within reach, even without the benefit of a leash.</p><h2> Choose a Reward </h2><p>Figure out what reward-maybe a treat, squeaky toy, or tug game-your puppy likes best. Be sure it's irresistible and much more exciting than anything else in your puppy's world. Reserve this treat for training exercises. Treat rewards are more about fun attention than food, so it should be tiny, smelly, and no bigger than the tip of your little finger.</p><h2> Minimize Distractions </h2><p>Find a time when the kids aren't around, the house is quiet, and any other pets are taking a nap. Avoid distractions so the puppy has only you to pay attention to. Call the puppy's name, get its attention, and go to it if needed so you can show off the treat or squeaky toy.</p><h2> Make a Game of It </h2><p>Once your puppy is focused on you and the reward, say its name and add ""come!"" Then turn around and run in the opposite direction. This encourages the dog's instinctive urge for social play. Puppies can rarely resist the urge to chase.</p><p>Let the puppy catch up to you, then hand or toss it the reward. Praise your pup for being such a smart doggy. Give lots of petting and happy talk, so it knows without a doubt that it has pleased you.</p><p>Repeat the chase game several times in a row. Leave your puppy wanting more, so stop before it gets tired of the game. Practice the ""come"" command in this way once or twice a day for a week.</p><h2> Increase the Difficulty </h2><p>After a week, try the exercise while standing still. Make sure the puppy isn't sleeping, eating, or concentrating on something incredibly interesting. Say your puppy's name and add ""come!"" and show the squeaky toy or treat. When the puppy arrives, throw a huge party with the treat or toy reward.</p><p>Once your puppy understands what ""come"" means and routinely obeys without distractions, it's time to challenge their recall ability. Try calling it away from interesting pastimes like chasing a butterfly or whatever has its attention. Practice ""come"" in new locations-not just in the living room, but also outside in the yard or at someone else's house.</p><p>Any time your puppy comes to you, no matter how long it takes, be sure to praise and reward. Above all, you want the puppy to have only positive associations so it will never fear to return to you.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Puppies refuse to come when called for several reasons. For instance, new puppies may not know their names yet, so you might as well be shouting gibberish.</p><p>In most cases, though, puppies simply don't know what the command means. It's important to explain the term in a language your puppy understands. After all, if you don't speak French, it's not fair to expect you to understand anything in that language, right? In the same way, it takes a while for puppies to learn ""human."" Clicker training is a great way to communicate with your puppy and something you might want to try as well.</p><p>Another reason puppies ignore the recall is that there's no benefit to them. Why should your puppy forget about chasing that butterfly, or running across the street to meet the kid with a ball, and instead come back to you? That's boring! Coming when called needs to trump whatever alternative behavior entices the puppy to ignore your command. Once your puppy does come to you, put the command to use on a regular basis. If you have no real need to call it back, do it anyway and offer a treat as a reminder of your lessons.</p><p>One of the most common-and worst-training mistakes is to punish the puppy once it finally does come. Sure, you're irked that you were ignored and had to frantically scream its name to come or maybe chasing the puppy made you late for work. However, you teach the wrong lesson by acting upset. The puppy learns that when it finally does come, it will be chastised, so it's even less likely to obey the next time. The bottom line is that you should never punish when your puppy comes, no matter how long it takes to respond.</p>",837

Before you enroll, it's helpful to know what to look for in a good trainer and facility and what you should expect your puppy to be learning.</p><h2> Find a Training Class </h2><p>A good puppy training class will be led by an experienced dog trainer.

Classes may be called ""puppy kindergarten"" or ""puppy manners.""</p><p>Fees for these classes will vary, but you typically get what you pay for. Be sure to research the trainer before you sign up for a class. Make sure the trainer has experience and references. The facility should also be dog-safe and have plenty of open space to work. </p><h2> Consider Class Structure </h2><p>Most puppy courses are held once a week for about four to eight weeks. The trainer will usually focus on two or three things during each class. It's common for them to provide home training goals for you to work on between weekly classes.</p><p>The ultimate goal of puppy classes is to set a good foundation for your dog's training and behavior in the future. Classes should cover the basics: socialization, house training tips, basic obedience, and general communication with your dog.</p><h2> Focus on Socialization </h2><p>Socialization is the most important part of any puppy training class. It refers to exposing puppies to as many new people, places, and situations as possible. The idea is that the more things a puppy is exposed to at a young age, the more accepting it will be of different people and experiences later in life. It's also less likely that your puppy will become fearful or aggressive. While it's important to work on other training with your puppy, socialization is what truly sets it on the path of a lifetime of good behavior.</p><p>Working on socialization in a puppy training class is ideal. It allows you to work on introducing your puppy to people, dogs, and other new things while under the supervision of an experienced dog trainer.</p><h2> Ask About Housebreaking </h2><p>While most dog trainers believe socialization is the most important part of puppy training, most new puppy owners are concerned with housebreaking. Every puppy training class should provide you with information on house training and crate training. The dog trainer leading the class should be able to address any specific concerns you have about housebreaking as well.</p><h2> Support Your Basic Obedience Lessons </h2><p>Puppy training classes should address some basic obedience commands. At the very least, you should learn how to train your puppy to sit, lie down, and walk on a loose leash. Some trainers focus on other important commands as well, during the puppy training course, such as come and stay.</p><h2> Address Behavior Problems </h2><p>Puppy training classes should also cover the more common behavior problems faced by puppy owners. Puppies tend to chew, jump, and whine when left alone and good classes will address these to some degree. Be sure to tell trainers of any specific behavior problems you're having with your puppy, and ask about what problems they are having in class.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>One of the most important aspects of a puppy training class is that the trainer should address all of your questions and concerns. Dogs think and act differently than people do, and it may take you a while to understand your new puppy's behavior. A good dog trainer will spend time ensuring you have a better understanding of why your puppy behaves the way it does, and what you can do to change any unwanted behaviors.</p><p>While learning how to train a puppy new commands is important, it should not be given more attention than socialization. If your dog trainer is only concerned with commands, you may want to find a new puppy class.</p><p>One of the common mistakes new puppy owners make is thinking that training is done when puppy classes end. In reality, training a dog never stops; as a pup gets older it becomes more about reinforcing the lessons. Keep up with everything you learned during class and employ the lessons in your everyday life. Challenge your puppy often, take your new skills and add new commands or tricks to your puppy's repertoire, and continue to use the commands your puppy has already learned so it doesn't forget.</p><p>Additionally, by the end of class, the trainer can help you decide what your dog can work on next if you're interested in going further. The trainer may recommend a next level training class or a specialized class to work on specifics. They can also advise you about getting your dog involved in activities like dog sports, animal-assisted therapy, or even a ""job"" for your dog. </p>",824
123,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-constipation-2804646,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>What to Do if Your Puppy Is Constipated</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Puppy Is Constipated</h1><p> Dr.</p><p>Constipation refers to the infrequent passage of dry, hard feces. If defecation is delayed and feces remain in the colon for two or three days, too much moisture is removed from the material by the colon, which makes elimination difficult and painful.</p><p>A constipated puppy may squat and strain unproductively for long periods of time. Ongoing constipation may result in a loss of appetite and the puppy losing weight or not gaining appropriately. If the condition becomes chronic, the puppy's bowel lining may become inflamed, which stimulates the release of mucus or dark fluid that accompanies the fecal matter. This may sometimes be confused with diarrhea. Although constipation occurs more often in older dogs, learn why and how to treat it in your puppy and when to visit the vet.</p><h2> Why Do Puppies Get Constipated </h2><p>Puppies may become constipated for a variety of reasons, including swallowed objects. Some foreign materials like sand or cat litter an turn feces into cement-like masses that prevent passage through the colon. Puppies are notorious for chewing and swallowing nondigestible objects like paper, sticks, grass, and cloth, which tend to turn into wads that cause impaction. Swallowing foreign objects also puts puppies at risk for intestinal obstruction or puncture.</p><h2> Poor Diet </h2><p>Some causes are food-related. Rawhide chews, if eaten in excess, can promote constipation in some dogs. Diets with little fiber produce stools that are smaller, denser, sticky, and difficult to pass. Lack of clean water can also cause constipation; if a puppy is dehydrated, this can result in harder stools.</p><h2> Stress </h2><p>Stress can also influence the condition. Puppies boarded or in strange surroundings may voluntarily delay defecation and become constipated. It's important during your puppy's socialization that it learns to defecate even when being walked by strangers (which is the case in boarding situations). Stress can also cause a pup to not want to eat or drink, which can further compound constipation.</p><h2> Grooming Issues </h2><p>Poor grooming, especially of long-haired puppies may also promote constipation. Some breeds such as Pomeranians can suffer from hairballs, just like cats, when they groom themselves and swallow fur. Other times, fur beneath the tail mats with feces and causes anal inflammation that results in painful defecation. Mats may even cause an external blockage that interferes with normal defecation. Keep puppies well-groomed and the anal region of long-haired puppies clipped to prevent mats from developing.</p><h2> Constipation in Adult Dogs </h2><p>Adult dogs can suffer from constipation for all the same reasons as a puppy, plus a few more. So if your pup has problems now, be aware of these issues in the future as well.</p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>See your veterinarian right away if your puppy hasn't defecated in more than two days or if the dog strains, crouches, or whines when it's trying to defecate. Your vet will want to rule out issues that look similar like diarrhea, intestinal obstruction, urinary tract infection, or back pain. A thorough physical exam will help guide the appropriate diagnostic tests and course of action.</p><h2> Help from the Veterinarian </h2><p>Your veterinarian may perform enemas or prescribe suppositories; ask for a demonstration on inserting suppositories before attempting to administer them yourself, but leave enemas to the vet or you risk injuring the puppy. Many times, evacuating a puppy's colon requires a veterinarian's help, and often the puppy must be sedated. At home, your dog's pain could translate into snaps or bites even though you're only trying to help. If dehydration is contributing to the problem, your veterinarian may recommend fluid therapy.</p><h2> Home Treatment </h2><p>Constipation treatment must address the specific cause to be effective, but in general, treatment for canine constipation is the same as for people. Feeding your puppy a diet containing 7 to 13 percent fiber (read the pet food label), encouraging it to drink lots of water, and initiating a regular exercise regimen, such as multiple 20-minute walks each day, are beneficial, as is increasing the puppy's playtime.</p><h2> How to Prevent Constipation </h2><p>While constipation is not always preventable, there are a number of things you can do to help prevent it from occurring in your puppy. Maintaining a complete and balanced diet, providing ample water, and a lot of exercise throughout the day can help regulate digestion. Make sure your puppy is properly groomed (especially long-haired breeds) and restrict access to foreign objects. If you notice any constipation or straining, take action right away to prevent constipation from getting worse.</p>",758
124,https://www.thesprucepets.com/get-a-puppy-used-to-a-crate-1118506,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Introduce a Crate to Your Puppy</h1>,"<h1>How to Introduce a Crate to Your Puppy</h1><p>Crate training is a great tool for housebreaking a puppy. A dog crate can also provide a safe haven for your puppy long after it becomes an adult. If you plan on using a crate to train a puppy, it's vital that you take the time to properly introduce the pup to the crate.</p><h3>Watch Now: How to Crate Train Your Dog or Puppy</h3><h2> Choose the Right Size </h2><p>Ensuring that your puppy easily gets used to its crate starts with choosing a crate that's the right size. No matter which type of dog crate you choose, it's important that you pay close attention to the dimensions.</p><p>Crates should be large enough for a puppy to lie down and turn around in comfortably. A crate that is too small will leave your puppy cramped and uncomfortable. A crate that is too large may leave enough space for your puppy to sleep and have a separate spot to use as a potty area.</p><h2> Make It Comfortable </h2><p>Before you introduce your puppy to the crate, try to make it as comfortable as possible. Most puppies aren't going to want to spend time lying on the cold, hard crate floor for very long.</p><p>Start by adding something soft, warm, and preferably washable in the bottom of the crate. Small throw blankets, towels, and crate pads all work well. Keep in mind that crate pads can be harder to clean. You might want to wait to get a pad until you have some housebreaking success.</p><p>There are also several products on the market designed to make a puppy's first days and nights in its new home easier. These are usually plush toys which allow you to tuck a hot water bottle inside or have devices that mimic the mother's heartbeat. Some puppy owners report having good luck using these types of products, so you may want to consider one to make the puppy's crate more comfortable.</p><h2> Make It Interesting </h2><p>It's also important to think about how to keep your puppy from getting bored in the crate. You may want to put some chew toys, stuffed animals, squeaky toys, or food dispensing toys in the crate.</p><p>For the best results, try putting two or three toys in at a time, and rotate the toys every few days or so. This way, your puppy finds something new and interesting every time it enters the crate.</p><h2> Let the Puppy Explore </h2><p>With the crate prepared, it's time to bring the puppy in. The first time your pup sees the crate, don't push it in and close the door. Instead, allow the puppy time to explore the crate on its own. Let it walk in and out of the crate at will. If the puppy seems hesitant to step into the crate, try throwing a few treats inside.</p><h2> Shut the Door </h2><p>Once the puppy has gotten comfortable walking in and out of the crate, you can begin closing the door behind it. Start off with short periods-no more than a few minutes each time-and work up to longer periods.</p><p>When you first close the crate door, stay in the room. After the puppy has been able to stay calm with the door closed a few times, start stepping outside of the room. The first time, simply step out for a few seconds and then come back into the room. Don't make a big deal, and don't immediately open the crate door. Slowly work your way up to leaving your puppy in the closed crate for longer periods.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>While a dog crate is a great tool for managing your puppy's behavior when you are unable to supervise, it's not meant to be the place the puppy spends all its time. Puppies need time to run around, play and socialize with their new family as well.</p><p>Since your puppy will be uncomfortable if it eliminates in the crate, it's important that you don't leave it in there longer than it can hold its bladder or bowels. Puppies under 6 months of age should not be left in a crate for more than three or four hours at a time. Young puppies may need even shorter periods in the crate to prevent having accidents in there.</p><p>A common mistake dog owners make is using the crate as a form of punishment. The goal of crate training is to create a happy environment where your puppy likes to spend time. Yelling at a dog and pushing it into the crate can lead to fear and anxiety whenever they go near it.</p><p>Additionally, in order for crate training to work, don't let your puppy out if it's whining or barking. That will only teach it that it gets what it wants by making a lot of noise. The puppy should be calm whenever you open the door.</p>",812
125,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bloated-puppy-2804919,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Bloat in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>Bloat in Puppies</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Bloat in puppies occurs when air accumulates in the stomach and cannot be released. This stops blood flow and can cause death within hours. Symptoms of bloat include a distended stomach, difficulty breathing, and dry heaving. Bloat affects large and giant breed puppies disproportionately, particularly Great Danes, Akitas, poodles, German shepherds, Irish setters, Saint Bernards, and Weimaraners. Your vet will examine your puppy, perform a series of tests to diagnose the bloat, and operate soon after. The prognosis depends on the success of treatment, but the mortality rate remains high. There are surgical and at-home measures you can take to help prevent bloat. </p><h2> What Is Bloat? </h2><p>Bloat, or gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV), occurs when the stomach fills with air and twists itself until the entrance and exit are blocked. The twisting cuts off blood circulation to the stomach and spleen, compressing a vein that returns blood to the heart and severely restricts normal blood circulation. Restricted blood circulation can rupture the stomach wall and inhibit the ability to breathe. Bloat is a leading cause of death among large and giant breed puppies.</p><h2> Symptoms of Bloat in Puppies </h2><p>Bloat is deadly in puppies. A few hours after beginning to exhibit symptoms, your puppy will likely go into shock and die. As soon as you notice symptoms, bring your puppy to an animal hospital for emergency surgery.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Puppies experiencing bloat will appear visibly uncomfortable and usually have a distended stomach. The pain may make your puppy act restless, pace, and whine and cry. Puppies may also wretch without producing vomit, as the blocked stomach entry will prevent regurgitation. The gums may appear pale, demonstrating a lack of oxygen, accompanied by shallow breathing and a rapid heartbeat. If your puppy is not treated, it will collapse and die. </p><h2> Causes of Bloat </h2><p>Several factors can contribute to your puppy experiencing bloat.</p><h2> Diagnosing Bloat in Puppies </h2><p>To diagnose your puppy with bloat, your vet will examine clinical signs, medical history, and perform blood analysis and imaging tests like an ultrasound or X-ray. Imaging tests will reveal the extent of the bloat, and blood analysis will evaluate the level of oxygen loss. A speedy diagnosis is ideal, as an operation should happen as soon as possible. </p><h2> Treatment </h2><p>If you notice your puppy has symptoms of bloat, it needs to be taken to an animal hospital immediately. First, your vet will stabilize your puppy by administering IV fluids and oxygen. To treat bloat, your veterinarian decompresses your puppy's distended stomach by passing a tube down its throat to empty air from the stomach and allow the return of normal blood flow. When the stomach is twisted, your puppy will need surgery to properly reconfigure it. Sometimes, part of the stomach or the entirety of the spleen will need to be removed. If your puppy's surgery is successful, your surgeon may perform a gastropexy (the suturing of the stomach to the abdominal wall) to prevent future twisting.</p><h2> Prognosis for Puppies With Bloat </h2><p>The prognosis for puppies with bloat varies based on how early treatment is received and the extent of the organ damage. After surgery, your vet will monitor your puppy in the hospital for several days. Some puppies treated can return to normal shortly after treatment, while others will die regardless. The mortality rate for puppies who have received treatment for bloat is 20 to 40 percent and rises with every organ injury sustained.</p><h2> How to Prevent Bloat </h2><p>Although you can't completely prevent bloat, there are measures you can take to reduce its likelihood of occurring. Gastropexy surgery may be recommended preventatively, particularly in Great Danes or other puppies predisposed to bloat. Gastropexy doesn't prevent air from being trapped in the stomach, but it does keep the stomach from twisting.</p><p>You can take many at-home measures to minimize the risk of bloat. These include lowering your puppy's food bowl, feeding smaller quantities of food over multiple meals throughout the day, separating multiple dogs at feeding times, and waiting several hours after eating before exercising your puppy. Positive puppy socialization that reduces anxiety can also help prevent bloat as it ages.</p><p>Often if your puppy eats too much or too fast, its belly can be overfilled with food and gas, press on other organs, and cause bloat.</p><p>Bloat most frequently occurs in large and giant breed dogs, but all dogs are able to experience the condition.</p><p>Bloat sets in within two to three hours after your puppy begins experiencing symptoms.</p>",792

You've probably been planning the arrival of your new furry friend for months (or even years!) or you might have fallen in love with an unsuspecting stray pup who is suddenly joining your household. But regardless of the circumstances of the new arrival, the first month with your puppy is a month of changes for everyone involved.</p><h2> Before Bringing Your Puppy Home </h2><p>If you are planning on bringing a new puppy into your home, then you should take some time to prepare for the puppy's arrival. There are a few key things you can purchase and have ready for your puppy ahead of time.</p><p>Place these new puppy items in your home for other people and any other pets you may already have to start adjusting to them. Don't just leave them in a bag until the puppy gets there. This will allow a more gradual change for the household to adapt to.</p><h2> First Day </h2><p>Day one with your new puppy is very exciting, but you'll want to be careful that you don't overwhelm it. If you don't have other dogs, let your puppy safely explore your home. Attach the leash to your puppy's collar and let it drag the leash around behind, while it sniffs out its new territory. Sit on the floor with your puppy and simply observe while it explores, making sure it is out of harm's way at all times. If you have a dog that you need to introduce to your puppy, consider allowing the dogs to meet in neutral territory, such as someone else's front yard.</p><p>Start using your puppy's name when calling it, to get it used to hearing your voice, and every half an hour or so take your puppy outside to go potty. It most likely won't know what to do in the yard, but you should simply say ""go potty"" and then ignore it, while it sniffs. If it does its business, be sure to reward it immediately with verbal praise, a small treat, and some petting. When you aren't watching your puppy, be sure to put it in its crate to keep it safe, and to encourage it not to have any accidents inside the house.</p><h2> 10 Days </h2><p>After a week or so, your puppy will be comfortable in its new home. It will probably be pushing the limits and chewing things it shouldn't be chewing, barking, playing, and having potty accidents in the house.</p><p>Stay consistent with your training and be patient. A puppy wants to please you but it will make mistakes. Continue to praise it when it does the right thing or deter it from doing the wrong thing by distracting it with a toy.</p><p>Your puppy will have claimed its favorite spot in the house. This may be its crate, bed, or under the coffee table, but wherever it is, this spot makes them feel secure and comfortable.</p><p>Make sure your puppy's urine and feces appears normal, as it can be common for puppies to get urinary tract infections and have intestinal parasites. If you haven't done so already, make an appointment with your veterinarian for a full physical examination, vaccinations, a fecal analysis, etc. for your puppy. Vaccinations need to be completed in specific, timed intervals in order for them to be effective, so you won't want to let your puppy get off schedule!</p><p>Try to resist the urge to take your puppy to places where other dogs may be or have been, unless they have finished their vaccination series and your veterinarian has deemed them healthy.</p><h2> 30 Days </h2><p>Your new puppy should have been to the vet at least once for vaccinations, but depending on the age of your puppy, multiple future visits may be necessary to complete its vaccinations. You'll also want to start your puppy on regular preventative medications to prevent or control fleas, ticks, intestinal parasites, and heartworms. These are typically monthly medications, but ask your veterinarian for their recommendation.</p><p>You should discuss spaying or neutering your puppy, microchipping, and pet insurance with your veterinarian as well. Depending on the age, breed, and health of your puppy, your veterinarian may have specific recommendations for these issues.</p><p>Don't panic if you have another dog at home and it isn't getting along with the new puppy just yet. This process can take time and 30 days may not be enough for your older dog to adapt to a young, energetic puppy. If your dog seems to be having a hard time with the youngster, try rewarding your dog with a treat every time the puppy is near. This will help your dog think of the new puppy as a positive thing, not just a nuisance.</p>",795
127,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppies-and-music-2804574,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Music Therapy for Your Puppy</h1>,"<h1>Music Therapy for Your Puppy</h1><h2>Calm or Energize Your Pet</h2><p> Dr.</p><p>Puppies and music can be a positive, therapeutic mix. Music can mask scary noises like thunder and fireworks, or upsetting sounds like a trespassing mail deliverer that put your puppy's tail in a twist. It can even be helpful for separation anxiety or ""pep up"" a lethargic pet. The cadence of certain sounds influences the body's natural rhythms and can speed them up and energize the listener, or slow them down to calm them.</p><h2> Music Therapy for Puppies </h2><p>A hyperactive or fearful pet can be soothed with music or distracted with nature sounds like water running from a fountain. Lethargic pets that need to exercise can be energized with chirping squirrel sounds or fast music to get them up and bouncing to the beat.</p><p>Puppies are even more sensitive to sound than people are. Puppy hearing is very acute, so it doesn't have to be loud music to have an effect.</p><p>Sound causes physical changes in the body. Brain waves change with different kinds of sounds-music with a pulse of about 60 beats per minute slows the brain waves so the listener feels more relaxed and peaceful and shifts the consciousness into a more alert state. This rhythm also slows breathing, which calms the mind and improves metabolism.</p><p>Even the heart wants to follow the pulse of the music-faster rhythms energize the listener as their heartbeat increases and blood pressure rises, while slower tempos simply calm them. Listening to music releases endorphins-natural painkillers that are produced by the brain-and reduces the levels of ""stress hormones"" in the blood.</p><h2> Sound Therapy </h2><p>Sound therapy is still considered pretty new. One of the best-known applications is an ultrasound that uses the ""echo"" of high-frequency sound waves to take diagnostic pictures inside the body; doctors even use it to break up kidney stones with vibration instead of surgery. Over the last 20 years, music therapy has become a staple of the human mental health profession and is often used with troubled children and brain-disordered patients. It's also helpful for stress relief for people in general.</p><p>Therapeutic harp music helps relieve pain that drugs don't, soothes an emotional upset, and has become of particular help in hospice situations for human patients. One of the pioneers, Susan Raimond, also promotes the therapeutic effect of harp music on animals. The sound of harp music calms fractious dogs and cats and offers almost a natural soothing effect to help upset animals become quiet, lay down and go to sleep.</p><h2> Helping Puppies With Music </h2><p>The simplest way to treat puppies with music is to put on music or turn on the radio. Choose the music you like-pets seem to respond best to music their owners enjoy because of the bond you share. If you have a favorite music genre you often play, your pet will associate the sound with your presence-so playing that same music when they are alone will remind them of you and help ease problems like separation anxiety.</p><p>Soft music with a slow, steady rhythm helps calm agitated puppies. It can help arthritic pets relax their muscles and increase their range of motion. It takes about 10 or 15 minutes for the music to take effect. Many pets enjoy Mozart or other classical music. New Age, soft jazz, southwest music with flutes and nature sounds, or even ballad-type country music can be soothing. The music should be melodic (not dissonant) and the tempo even and slow. You can play calming music anytime your pet feels stressed-even all day long as a background to help keep them calm.</p><p>Turn up the volume to energize your pet. Uptempo music may amplify the bond between you and your puppy when used during times of high energy and exercise. Moderate to loud music with a more driving beat energizes the emotions. Rock music, even the driving energy of rap may get a pet's tail moving, but any up-tempo music from classical to contemporary has the power to energize. Again, play the music for at least 10 to 15 minutes at a time to get your pet in the right mood and use the time to play with your pup.</p><p>Any music that you play on a regular basis helps your puppy identify that sound with your comforting presence. Even if your puppy doesn't suffer from separation anxiety, familiar music can help if you need to be away from home, because you can play your favorite music to help your pup feel better about your absence.</p>",747
128,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-puppies-shed-2804792,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Why Puppies Shed</h1>,"<h1>Why Puppies Shed</h1><h2>How to deal with puppy shedding when the fur flies</h2><p>Shedding can turn into a big, hairy deal, but it's a normal part of living with a puppy. All puppies shed, even the breeds considered to be non-shedding. Anyone who's had to lint-roll their black pants recently knows that this is true of all dogs.</p><p>You don't have to live with drifts of fur and can keep your home and clothing relatively hair-free with a few simple precautions. Here's why dogs shed and what you can do to keep your puppy's coat and skin healthy.</p><h2> Hair Growth Cycle </h2><p>Hair and fur do not grow all the time but are continuously renewed in a cycle of growth, rest, and loss. New hair pushes out the old, resting ones, and this fur loss is called shedding.</p><p>All hair follicles in the skin go through a cycle of active growth, called That's followed by a brief period of shrinkage, during which the hair root loosens. The ending phase, called is the stage in which hairs are shed as they're pushed out and replaced by new, emerging hairs.</p><p>The length of the hair growth period varies from breed to breed. Most dogs have a seasonal shed in the spring and/or during the fall. It's not the temperature that prompts shedding; instead, light exposure, either to the sun or artificial light, determines the amount and timing. More hair is shed during the greatest exposure to light.</p><p>Outdoor dogs living in the northeastern United States shed every year, most heavily in late spring for the several weeks during which daylight increases. However, house pets under constant exposure to artificial light may shed all year long.</p><h2> What About Low-Shedding Puppies? </h2><p>Breeds like poodles and some terriers that are referred to as non-shedding do shed. Instead of the anagen hair-growing phase lasting a short time, their hair grows for years before it's shed and may grow quite long unless clipped.</p><p>These types of coats don't tend to shed all at once. You won't notice clumps of fur coming out because they only lose a few hairs at a time. Because these breeds also tend to have curly coats, lost hairs tangle alongside the growing hairs and don't always end up on the furniture. The fur may turn into long cords, as with the Puli and Komondor breeds, unless kept trimmed.</p><p>Depending on when your puppy was born, it may shed its puppy coat before the regular seasonal shed in the spring or fall. Most puppies lose their baby coat between 6 and 12 months of age as the new adult fur replaces it. This can vary from breed to breed.</p><h2> Shedding Risks </h2><p>Breeds with heavy double coats that shed in clumps are more prone to developing painful mats. These happen when fur is trapped next to the skin, especially in the groin and armpit regions. Mats can create bruises and can lead to hot spots.</p><p>You can't stop shedding, but you can reduce the aggravation to yourself and your pet. Comb and brush it regularly. Thickly furred puppies need daily attention, but short-haired pets also benefit from consistent grooming. Pay particular attention to combing the mat-prone areas behind the dog's ears, beneath its tail, and in the creases of its legs.</p><p>One tool you can use to prevent these issues is the EZ-Groomer, a lightweight, claw-shaped comb that breaks up established mats and removes shed fur. Unlike most other combs or brushes, you can use the EZ-Groomer to comb backward on the pet, for a beneficial effect. This product also is quite economical, in the $10 to $15 range, and comes in two sizes for small to large pets.</p><p>The FURminator won't work on mats but does an extraordinary job removing shed fur. Tiny, shallow, close-fitting teeth pull off 80 to 90 percent of loose hairs. Try grooming your pet with a standard comb or brush, then follow up with the FURminator you'll be shocked at the mountains of lint. This product also comes in different sizes to match your pet but is quite pricey. Make sure you groom your pet outside or in an easy-to-clean area so that you don't create a furry tornado inside the house.</p><p>You don't have to groom your whole puppy in one setting. If you don't have the time or your pet gets impatient, you can spread grooming sessions out over several hours or days to keep it happy. Follow each session with a favorite treat or game to train your puppy to identify grooming with good things. Be sure to comb your puppy thoroughly before you bathe it, which will loosen even more shed fur. Fur removed by grooming won't cause mats or end up on your clothes and furniture. If you aren't able to manage grooming yourself, have it professionally done.</p>",793

A puppy's normal temperature is a few degrees lower than that of an adult dog until the age of four weeks. Learn how to take a puppy's temperature and when to be concerned about it being high or low.</p><h2> Normal Body Temperature in Puppies </h2><p>A newborn puppy can't regulate body temperature and needs the warmth of its mother and littermates to stay at a healthy temperature. Their own body temperature will change based on their environment, so they can be at risk for getting too hot as well as too cold. The normal temperature for a newborn pup is between 96 to 98 degrees Fahrenheit, and a temperature out of this range can indicate a health problem.</p><p>During the second and third weeks of life, a puppy's body temperature will range from 97 to 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. In the fourth week, a puppy will have the usual normal body temperature of an adult dog, from 99.5 to 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>If you do need to take your puppy's temperature at home, make sure you learn the proper technique and give your dog lots of treats and positive reinforcement. It will also help to get the dog used to being handled in this way so that when the veterinarian does this in the future, your puppy won't be scared.</p><h2> Fever in Puppies </h2><p>Temperatures higher than normal may be referred to as a fever or hyperthermia depending on the cause.</p><p>Fever is the body's normal defense mechanism to fight infection because a higher than normal body temperature helps the immune system fight viruses and bacteria. Fevers associated with infection may be caused by a wide variety of illnesses or infected wounds, including Parvovirus, Distemper, pneumonia, Kennel cough, ear infections, infected bite wounds, a painful hot spot, or any other source of infection within the body.</p><p>A higher than normal body temperature can also be due to overheating during exercise or to exposure to high temperatures. Puppies and dogs of any age can get heat stroke in this case and will have an abnormally elevated temperature as well as other signs of heat stroke including lethargy, disorientation, diarrhea with blood, or even seizures.</p><p>You should seek a veterinarian's care when your dog's temperature is elevated above 103 degrees Fahrenheit, especially if they have any other concerning signs. At very high temperatures, damage to the dog's internal organs can occur and could even prove to be fatal so it is best not to wait until that point. You can safely help reduce a dog's temperature by placing a cool water-soaked washcloth on your dog and placing them in front of a fan. Don't give your dog any human fever-reducing medications unless directed by your veterinarian as many of these are toxic to dogs.</p><h2> Low Body Temperature in Puppies </h2><p>Hypothermia is body temperature that falls lower than normal. Newborn puppies that squirm away from their littermates or mom can experience a life-threatening drop in body temperature. An orphaned newborn puppy should be kept in an environment of 85 to 90 Fahrenheit for the first week and then 80 degrees Fahrenheit until the fourth week. It is very important to use safe sources of heat to avoid burns to the skin and overheating. Discuss with your veterinarian the most effective ways to keep an orphaned puppy warm.</p><p>Shock also can cause hypothermia due to a number of causes including loss of blood, severe dehydration, or poor circulation. Trauma including a fall, being hit by a car, severe bite wounds, as well as heart failure, or a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, are common causes of shock.</p><p>Low body temperature can also occur from certain drugs, such as anesthetics and sedatives.</p><p>A drop in body temperature also happens with prolonged exposure to extreme cold. Hypothermia can kill young puppies quickly, but any dog can be at risk if it does not have protection from extremely cold weather, which also can cause frostbite. If your dog has a low temperature due to exposure to extreme cold, rewarm your pet slowly over the course of one to four hours, with a goal of reaching a temperature of around 98-99 degrees Fahrenheit. Again, it is important to use an appropriate warming technique to avoid burns or other complications so it is best to see a vet right away if you are concerned about hypothermia.</p><h2> How to Take Your Puppy's Temperature </h2><p>You will need a human rectal thermometer to get a good reading. Ear temperature is unreliable in dogs, and checking how the nose feels is simply an old myth.</p>",789
130,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-vaccinations-1118656,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Puppy Vaccinations</h1>,"<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Puppy Vaccinations</h1><p>Vaccines are an essential part of a puppy's health care plan. Certain basic immunizations are essential to keep your puppy from getting sick and prevent the spread of disease.</p><h2> Why Vaccinate Your Puppy? </h2><p>When puppies are born, their immune systems are not fully developed, so they cannot fight diseases as effectively as older dogs. Puppies receive protective antibodies from their mothers through nursing. During the first few hours of a puppy's life, nursing mothers provide an especially antibody-rich milk called colostrum. These antibodies provide puppies with temporary immunity against illness. While the length of this immunity varies from puppy to puppy, it is generally believed that maternal antibodies wane gradually and are gone by 16 weeks of age.</p><p>Enter puppy vaccinations. Vaccines are designed to trigger immune responses and prevent future infection from diseases. All puppies should be administered certain core vaccines which provide immunity against the most dangerous and widespread diseases. 'Core' vaccines are the ones considered most essential for puppies in most geographical locations. Depending on your location and your puppy's environment, non-core vaccines may also be recommended. Talk to your vet about your puppy's risk of exposure to these diseases.</p><h2> How They Work </h2><p>Puppy vaccines are typically first administered at about six to eight weeks of age, then repeated every three to four weeks until the pup is at least four months of age. Some of these vaccines might be given together in one injection that is called a combination vaccine. At your puppy's first veterinary exam, your vet will discuss the schedule of vaccinations and other treatments for your puppy, such as deworming, beginning heartworm prevention, and scheduling a spay or neuter. The vaccine injection itself is typically not painful. Some puppies seem to feel a little pinch or sting while others do not react at all.</p><p>Your veterinarian will need to do an examination before vaccinating your puppy. Note that vaccines are not usually given to a puppy with a fever or other signs of serious illness as the vaccine may not be as effective if the body is fighting another infection, and/or could make the puppy feel worse. </p><p>After a vaccine is administered, immunity is not immediate; it takes up to a few weeks to become effective and this varies between animals. Puppies that still have maternal antibodies will not have as strong of an immune response to a vaccine and therefore will be less protected. There is no way to be certain if a puppy still has maternal antibodies, hence the reason for boosters. Complete immunity is uncertain until about four months of age, or until all puppy boosters are completed. Avoid bringing your puppy to dog parks, walking them outside in public places, or otherwise exposing your puppy to unknown animals until all vaccinations have been given. See the chart below for a typical vaccine schedule.</p><h2> Puppy Vaccine Schedule (Sample): </h2><p>A Note on Adult Boosters</p><p>Most vaccines require a booster within 1 year after the puppy series. After the initial boosters, some vaccines will need to be given annually, and others will only need to be given every 3 years. There is a 3- year rabies vaccine available, for example.</p><h2> Risks </h2><p>There are some risks associated with vaccinations though relatively uncommon. Vaccine reactions and side effects are typically mild and self-limiting. Signs may include pain and swelling at the injection site, lethargy or fever. Severe allergic reactions are rare but can be fatal if left untreated. If your puppy develops hives, facial swelling, difficulty breathing, vomiting, or bloody diarrhea, contact your vet immediately.</p><p>Because vaccinations stimulate the immune system, there is a small risk of developing an autoimmune disorder after vaccines. This is very uncommon when you consider the small number of dogs who develop these conditions versus all of the dogs that are vaccinated. However, autoimmune disorders can be serious and difficult to treat. Autoimmune conditions that may occur include blood disorders, neuromuscular issues, and even skin problems.</p><p>Despite the small chance for potential side effects, the benefits outweigh the risks when it comes to puppy vaccines. Sadly, puppies who are not vaccinated are at high risk for contracting diseases which can be very serious, and often fatal such as Distemper and Parvovirus. However, for adult dogs who received a complete set of puppy vaccines, many vets are embracing protocols that vaccinate less often. Once given annually, many adult vaccinations are now more likely to be recommended every three years since there is evidence that immunity lasts well beyond 1 year in many cases. Some vaccines still require annual boosters to be effective including Bordetella (Kennel Cough), Leptospirosis, and Lyme.</p>",786
131,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-travel-training-car-rides-2804753,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Train Your Puppy for Car Rides</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Puppy for Car Rides</h1><p>If your puppy fears riding in the car, it can be a hassle to travel with it, even to bring it along on errands. Some puppies throw fits, cry, and even get sick on the drive. Learn what you can do to ease those fears so your new dog will grow into an excellent traveling companion at home and away.</p><h2> Why Puppies Hate Cars </h2><p>While some pets look forward to car rides, it's understandable why some develop a fear of these trips. Many car rides end up at the veterinarian for vaccinations and unpleasantly cold thermometers inserted in uncomfortable places.</p><p>You may want to comfort your frightened pet, but take care not to imitate the sounds your dog is making. When you make what you think are soothing, sympathetic sounds, it can sound to your dog like its own whining. You could be reinforcing that car rides are uncomfortable and scary, even for humans, and giving your puppy justification to continue fussing.</p><h2> Ease Travel Fears </h2><p>Associate cars with fun, happy experiences instead of just a trip to the vet. This process, called desensitization, takes patience and time, but it works whether a pet acts scared, sick, or just hyper. Once your puppy realizes a car ride means wonderful things, it will look forward to every trip.</p><p>For a very frightened pup, set its food bowl near the car, and allow it to enjoy a meal. After several days when it's used to that, leave the car door open and feed the dog in the back seat if you're comfortable with that. In between feeding times, throw non-messy treats in the open car door for the pup to find.</p><p>Your dog should learn good things that can happen when you're near the car. Try playing a game or doing tricks in the vicinity of the car. If you leave the car doors open and the dog climbs in, don't make a big fuss, just continue the game like it's no big deal.</p><p>Be sure the car is safely parked, away from the street and with the parking brake on. Never play games in the street or with a moving car.</p><h2> Sit in the Car Quietly </h2><p>When your pup's eating or otherwise distracted in the back seat, get in the front seat behind the steering wheel. Just sit there for a while like it's no big deal, then get out, so it understands nothing scary happens when you're in the car too. Do this for one day.</p><p>The next day when you're behind the wheel and your puppy's munching treats in the back seat, start the car. Then turn off the motor and get out without going anywhere. Do this three or four times during the day until the pet takes it as a matter of course.</p><h2> Take (Very) Short Trips </h2><p>Finally, after you start the car, back the car to the end of the driveway and stop. Do this two or three times in a row, always letting the pet out after you return. If the puppy whines, paces or shows stress, you may be moving too fast for it. The process takes a while, but it works.</p><p>Continue increasing the car-time by increments-a trip around the block and then home, then a trip to the nearest fun place like the park before returning home. Go somewhere you know your dog will enjoy. Make every car trip upbeat and positive so the experience makes the dog look forward to the next trip.</p><h2> Crate Train in the Car </h2><p>It's a good idea to crate train and confine your puppy while in the moving car. A loose animal inside the car can be dangerous both to the pet and the driver. Invest in a seat belt, car barrier, or a kennel.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Puppies can be crushed by deploying airbags, so keep them in the back seat. Many accidents have happened when a dog gets underfoot and the driver can't use the brakes or accelerator appropriately. Above all, a dog in the front seat is a distraction, and you need to keep your attention on your driving.</p><p>Once your dog is too big to fit in a car-size crate, consider installing a gated barrier or fit the dog with a harness, using the seatbelt for safety. While your dog may not like this at first, it is the safest thing for the long run.</p><p>By ensuring that most of your car trips are to destinations your dog will enjoy, you can gradually ease your dog's fears. With persistence, you can have a pet who not only tolerates car rides but eagerly looks forward to them.</p>",778

Plan now so that your puppy knows what to expect and you ensure they'll have a safe and stress-free vacation, too.</p><p>Many of us will travel to visit family and friends, have people over to visit, or spend vacation time away from home. Time off from work and a change of routine offer humans much-needed stress relief. But the same is not always true for furry family members.</p><h2> Know Your Pet </h2><p>Good vacation plans depend on the individual pet and your special circumstances. Does your dog love meeting new people, hide, or become hyper around strangers? Perhaps the new puppy enjoys riding in the car but your brother's cat hates dogs, or your nephew has allergies.</p><p>Some dogs do well when boarded at the kennel, and that can keep them away from hair-pulling toddlers. Even the best-behaved pup could scratch a new baby by accident and put you both in the dog house with the new parents. However, some needy pups that suffer separation anxiety go on a hunger strike if away from home.</p><h2> Your Vacation Plans </h2><p>Destination matters, too. Your pups may not be welcome at a Colorado ski resort. Even if they are, the crew must be happy campers-literally, if you plan hiking trips or outdoor overnights.</p><p>Leaving pups at home alone for a short time is also an option, but unless your pup is litter box trained (yes, it can be done!), you should have someone to check on your puppy more frequently for potty breaks and meals. Some pups eat four days' worth of food at one time if it's left out all at once. And young dogs are notorious for getting into trouble when unsupervised, so this is not an ideal option. Make arrangements to have a friend, a neighbor, or a professional pet sitter visit at least once a day to take the pup outside for potty breaks, and check food and water. The puppy will appreciate some playtime and cuddles, too, while you're gone.</p><h2> Boarding Options </h2><p>Many pups are fine when boarded at kennels. Reputable kennels require proof of adequate health care, so get vaccination proof from your veterinarian in advance. Some state-of-the-art facilities now provide pets with sofas and play times with other dogs. Some kennels even have closed-circuit television monitors owners can access over the Internet while on vacation, to keep an eye on their furry friends.</p><p>Visit the kennel yourself, ask for recommendations from other clients or veterinarians, and satisfy yourself your pup will be happy and any special needs can be met. For instance, if they need a particular food or medication at certain times of the day, ensure the staff are aware and can manage this.</p><p>Veterinarians may have kennel space available for dogs with health issues that need monitoring. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations regarding boarding facilities.</p><h2> Pet Sitters </h2><p>A pet sitter comes to your house at predetermined times, to provide the one-on-one attention and care your pets need while you are away. It's important that both you and your pets feel comfortable with the pet sitter. Plan at least one visit with the pet sitter to meet your furry crew before you depart, and see how everyone gets along. Always ask for references. You can also search via professional organizations including the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters and Pet Sitters International.</p><h2> Care and Medical Needs </h2><p>Be sure to leave caretakers with detailed information about each pet's care needs, veterinary contact information, and emergency phone numbers where you can be reached. Talk with your veterinarian about signing a ""just in case"" authorization for medical care (you can designate the dollar amount). That way, emergency care is available and paid for even if you are unavailable to give your approval in person.</p><p>If your puppy is a good traveler, and welcome to your vacation destination, you'll still need proof of health status. Your veterinarian can provide you with a Health Certificate, required for pets traveling on planes or crossing state lines traveling by car.</p><p>Call airlines and hotels ahead of time to find out the latest pet requirements. To qualify as ""carry-on"" luggage, the pet carrier must fit under the airline seat in front of your legs. These days, the price of flying with pets has increased substantially, and some carriers and hotels won't allow animals at all, so find out in advance.</p><p>Preparing for your pet's comfort during your vacations gives you peace of mind so you can enjoy your time free from worries. After all the joy they bring you throughout the year, don't your puppies deserve happy holidays too?</p>",779
133,https://www.thesprucepets.com/salmonella-symptoms-2804974,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Salmonella Symptoms and Treatment</h1>,"<h1>Salmonella Symptoms and Treatment</h1><h2>How salmonella contamination affects pet food</h2><p> Dr.</p><p>Salmonella is a bacteria which can cause illness in people and pets and can contaminate homemade puppy food as well as commercial dog foods and cause pet food recalls. There are nearly 2000 kinds of salmonella bacteria. Most are found naturally in the environment and can remain alive for months or years in manure or soil. Some types are normal inhabitants of animals and don't cause problems. Others prompt a variety of illnesses from diarrheal disease to a life-threatening illness that causes a variety of salmonella symptoms you need to watch for.</p><p>When the disease is seen in an adult dog, the animal typically has another infection or health problem at the same time. Puppies are more likely to show signs of disease. Dogs contract the bacteria by drinking infected water, eating raw or commercial food rations contaminated with infected droppings, or by eating manure.</p><h2> What to Feed for Safety </h2><p>You are what you eat applies to pets just as much as it does to people. After the pet food recall of 2007, many pet owners decided to become do-it-yourself feeders and home cook for their pets.</p><p>The veterinary community cautions pet owners about home cooking food and especially raw diets for two reasons. First, it's very difficult to create a nutritionally sound diet for your pet on a sustained basis. Only with a sound recipe from a vet nutritionist can it be done successfully, and can be particularly helpful for pets with therapeutic dietary needs.</p><p>Second is the fear of food contamination, and salmonella is a real danger more for people (especially kids and immune compromised folks) than for pets. Safe handling of food is a must even with people food, though. The fear has been that widespread home cooking and/or raw feeding could result in an outbreak of salmonella.</p><p>More and more, though, commercial diets and treats have been recalled due to concern for contamination with salmonella during processing. The increase is suspected to be due to increased public awareness, expanded surveillance, and early reporting. Responsible pet food companies broadcast announcements about any suspect batches of food to warn pet owners, and recall specific products that may be implicated. As a responsible puppy owner, learn about the signs of the disease and how you can best protect your puppy-and yourself-from the illness.</p><h2> Signs of Salmonella Illness </h2><p>Most infected dogs never show signs of illness but may harbor the bacteria and spread the disease to other animals and people.</p><p>The bacteria may be carried in the bloodstream to the liver, lungs, or uterus. Once in the bloodstream, dogs can become critically ill and require intensive care. Signs of disease typically last four to ten days, but diarrhea may continue for a month or longer.</p><h2> How Is Salmonella Diagnosed and Treated </h2><p>The condition is diagnosed from signs of illness, and from finding the bacteria in the blood or tissues of the affected dog. When enteritis is the primary problem, treatment usually consists of fluid therapy to help correct dehydration and medications to help with nausea and discomfort.</p><p>A culture of the stool sample will identify the strain of salmonella so that the most effective antibiotic can be given. However, antibiotic therapy is only indicated in instances of severe systemic disease, to avoid the possibility of promoting the development of a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria.</p><h2> How to Prevent Salmonella </h2><p>Protect your puppy from salmonella by curtailing his hunting. Dogs that eat rodents or other wildlife are at much greater risk.</p><p>Don't feed the pup raw or undercooked meat. If you choose to provide a raw food diet, take extra precautions to ensure the food is safe for your puppy and humans handling the food.</p><p>Pick up the yard and dispose of fecal material promptly.</p><p>Protect yourself by religiously washing your hands after dealing with dog food, feces or handling an ill dog. Wearing gloves in combination with handwashing is a safe option for handling pet waste. Use a dilute bleach and water solution (1 to 32 ratio) to disinfect dog bowls, toys, and areas where the pup sleeps.</p>",725
134,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppies-and-kids-2805084,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Train a New Puppy to Get Along With Kids</h1>,"<h1>How to Train a New Puppy to Get Along With Kids</h1><p>Introducing a new puppy, especially to kids and toddlers, should be done with care to avoid injury to either the child(ren) or the puppy. Once they start walking and as they grow, kids can become more interesting-and challenging-for your puppy.</p><p>While young children may mean no harm, depending on their age, they may treat your puppy like a stuffed toy by poking eyes, pulling fur, chasing, or trying to hug or kiss the dog. A frightened or injured pup instinctively may respond by biting and growling.</p><p>It's important to set some clear boundaries between your puppy and your child or toddler so that they can learn to trust each other without anyone getting hurt.</p><h2> Provide a Safe Retreat </h2><p>Be sure your puppy has a canine sanctuary that's off limits to kids. Even pets that adore children need private time and a place to go where they know they won't be pestered. Make a bedroom, or the puppy's crate and bed, off-limits to the children, and supervise to enforce the rule if the children are too young to understand.</p><h2> Teach Kids Limits </h2><p>Before allowing them near a dog, ask kids to practice petting a stuffed toy or the child's own arm or head. Young kids should be taught that dogs aren't stuffed animals, and can be hurt and lash out from pulled tails or ears.</p><h2> Practice Quiet Puppy Talk </h2><p>High pitched screams, the typical way an excited child may communicate, could potentially prompt a puppy to become aggressive to a child. Challenge children to a game to see if they can talk in an inside voice that entices puppies to come closer for petting or treats. You can explain that just like children can get frightened of scary sounds, puppies can be scared and it takes very talented kids to know how to be pup-friendly.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Just as you reward the puppy with praise for good behavior, make sure the child knows you appreciate their sensitivity toward the dog.</p><h2> Ignore the Puppy </h2><p>Staring is a challenge in dog language that can stress some pets, especially from kids that are at a dog's eye level. But when ignored, pups are more likely to be intrigued enough to investigate on their own.</p><p>So challenge your toddler or older child to an ""ignore the pup"" game, and see how long they can pretend the puppy is invisible. In most cases, a confident canine will eventually approach. It may approach and retreat quickly, but will likely approach again if it doesn't get any negative reaction.</p><h2> Seat the Kids </h2><p>Puppies take turns playing chase-and-tackle games with each other, so when chased by toddlers, they may get too rough without meaning to. Make it a dog rule that young kids must sit before they can pet the dog and that the dog gets to approach. That also lets the pup control interactions and move away when the puppy has had enough.</p><p>Forcing a dog to sit still for a child's unwanted attention may cause the puppy to avoid the child in the future. This instead makes it the dog's choice and a fun and rewarding experience. Once seated, the child can lure and entice the puppy with a toy. Playing builds a positive relationship that can grow into love.</p><h2> Offer Treats </h2><p>When pups still act reluctant to approach, find a special tasty treat the pet loves but only gets from the child. While sitting on the floor, the child should gently toss the treat to (not at) the dog. Until or unless you're satisfied the puppy won't also nip the child's hands, make sure that the treat gets eaten from the floor rather than the child's fingers.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>There are always exceptions, but as a general rule, children should be at least 6 or 7 years old before being given responsibility for a puppy's care. However, you can begin supervised care duties, such as filling the puppy's water bowl or teaching how to comb and groom the fur coat, at this point. The more pleasant experiences your children enjoy with the puppy, the stronger the bond between them.</p><p>Kids smell different than adults, have high-pitched funny voices, move in unpredictable ways, and can appear threatening. Don't expect every dog to feel the same way about children that they do about you or even other adults. Some big pups may love playing ""pony"" with a visiting toddler, but a clueless young child could seriously injure small pups without meaning to. Be on guard for any kid-puppy interaction to make sure everyone is behaving.</p>",761
135,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-fur-coat-growth-function-2804784,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>Puppy Fur - Growth and Function</h1>,"<h1>Puppy Fur - Growth and Function</h1><p>Puppy fur is made up of individual hairs. The characteristics of a dog's coat depends on the texture and color of the individual hairs, which are thread-like structures made of keratin that grow outward from hair follicles in the skin.</p><h2> What Is Fur? </h2><p>Fur serves as a protective barrier that shields the puppy's skin from the elements, regulates body temperature, and protects puppies from sunburn, heatstroke, frostbite, and hypothermia. Hair also acts like a candle ""wick"" to route scent chemicals related to identification and sexual status, sending scents from the skin into the air.</p><p>All healthy dogs have fur, but the amount and type of hair coat varies in individuals and from breed to breed. Even the hairless Chinese Crested dog has sparse hair on the face, feet, and tail.</p><h2> What Is Hair? </h2><p>Hairs are composed of the hair shaft, which is the visible portion of the hair, and a root generated by a hair follicle within the skin. Dogs have compound follicles, which means as many as 15 hairs can grow from a single pore. People have simple follicles which produce only one hair for each pore.</p><p>Dogs primarily have 2 kinds of hairs, characterized by length and diameter. Guard or primary hairs are the longest, coarsest hairs of the outer coat. Secondary hairs of various lengths make up the undercoat. The undercoat is soft, short cotton-like fur that's curly or crimped. All types of hairs may sprout from a single compound follicle.</p><p>The length of the hair shaft and the ratio of guard to undercoat hairs varies from breed to breed. These differences, as well as a variety of colors and patterns, produce each dog's distinctive coat.</p><h2> How Fur Grows </h2><p>Each hair grows from the root in a predictable cycle of growth. The growing phase is called the anagen phase which is followed by the catagen phase in which the root detaches from the follicle, and a resting period termed the telogen phase. Old loose hairs in the telogen phase are pushed out-called shedding-by new hairs as the anagen phase begins again. The fur that is shed is composed of telogen hairs.</p><p>A single human hair may grow for up to six years before being shed and replaced by a new one. The growth cycle of your dog's hair is much shorter and more synchronized, which accounts for the massive seasonal shedding some dogs experience. Fur growth cycles can vary from breed to breed. Breeds that shed more tend to have more follicles in the telogen phase. The ""non-shedding"" breeds like the Poodle and some terriers, have single layer coats with hairs that actually grow for several years before being replaced. This is because they have more follicles in the anagen phase most of the time.</p><p>A healthy coat is possible only with proper nutrition and good overall health. Your puppy's coat retains its healthy glow from the proper balance of oils in the skin. Poor nutrition may be reflected in the skin and hair coat by dry, lifeless fur or abnormal hair loss. These can also be signs of underlying health problems. Grooming is beneficial for all dogs and particularly important for dogs with thick long coats.</p><h2> Puppy Whiskers </h2><p>Whiskers are the thick, long, wire-like hairs that protrude from the dog's face. Also called vibrissae or sinus hairs, whiskers are specialized hairs that are long, supple and thick; they may also appear as groupings of short stiff bristles.</p><p>Whiskers are much more developed in animals that hunt during the night or low-light times. They act as feelers and are seated deep in the skin where they trigger nerve receptors at the slightest touch.</p><p>Dogs typically have whiskers in four places on each side of the head and two on the lower jaw. The most obvious are those on each side of the dog's muzzle, where whiskers grow in rows; they provide tactile information when the dog is sticking his muzzle in and around objects.</p><p>Whiskers above each eye act like extended eyelashes. They prompt a protective blink reflex if touched. A clump of whiskers is located on each cheek and a smaller one near each corner of the mouth. Lastly, the dog has a tuft beneath the chin. These strategic locations provide extra-sensitive sensory input from the dog's environment and may help with activities including tracking behavior, locating objects, balance and orientation of the head, protection from surrounding objects, and more. For this reason, whiskers should be treated with care and should never be trimmed.</p>",749
136,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-socialization-handling-exercises-1118509,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Train a Puppy to Accept Handling</h1>,"<h1>How to Train a Puppy to Accept Handling</h1><p>Teaching a puppy to calmly accept handling is a big part of puppy training. Puppies go through a critical period of development which ends around the age of 16 weeks. Often dogs will be more accepting of things they encounter later in life if they are exposed to them during this critical period.</p><p>For instance, a dog who has never had its feet handled as a puppy is more likely to growl, snap, or bite when a groomer tries to trim its nails later on. But a dog that is used to being handled is more likely to accept it, even from a stranger. This doesn't mean that every dog who isn't used to having its feet handled is going to become aggressive when it goes to the groomer. It just increases a dog's chances of being comfortable with handling.</p><h2> Start With One Person to Train </h2><p>To get your puppy comfortable with being handled, you should start by doing the handling exercises yourself. Your puppy is familiar with you and most likely to accept being handled, poked, and prodded by you. Once your puppy is comfortable with you handling all parts of its body, you can ask other people to help with handling exercises. If the puppy is kept happy and comfortable during handling exercises, it will quickly learn to accept or even enjoy being handled, hugged, and examined by anyone who comes along.</p><h2> Schedule Exercises </h2><p>Handling exercises should be done a few times a day for several minutes each time. You may also want to join a puppy training class. These types of training classes, often referred to as puppy kindergarten, usually focus on puppy socialization. Doing a puppy class once a week gives you the opportunity to introduce your puppy to being handled by other people under the supervision of an experienced dog trainer.</p><h2> Start Off Gently </h2><p>When you first start doing handling exercises with your puppy, start off gently. Try to pair handling with things the puppy likes, such as praise, treats, and games. With this type of positive reinforcement, your puppy will soon associate things such as being hugged and having its ears examined with things it enjoys. Some good ways to begin include stroking and petting the puppy from its head all the way down its back. If that goes over well, gently hold each of the puppy's paws. Go slowly, as dogs' paws are sensitive and the puppy may be wary.</p><h2> Handle the Whole Body </h2><p>Plan to spend two or three minutes on each touch, and stop if your puppy seems anxious or upset. If you're using clicker training, you may want to click the clicker when the puppy allows you to handle it. Offering a treat when the puppy responds positively to touching also may be effective.</p><p>The goal is to gently move around the puppy's whole body. From the face, you can unfold the puppy's ears, and look inside. It will take more than one session for the puppy to be comfortable with this, so be patient. Then lift the puppy's muzzle to check its teeth.</p><p>Move down and rub the puppy's belly. This is generally acceptable to most puppies. You can then gently tug the puppy's tail. The tail is a sensitive area and the puppy may be protective of its genitals, so don't get too close until it's ready. For a whole body exercise, gently hug the puppy. Then calmly restrain the pup, hugging and holding it still.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>The point of puppy handling exercises is to make the puppy comfortable with accepting petting and other types of handling. If at any point your puppy seems fearful or uncomfortable, you should take a step back. Give your puppy some space and continue handling exercises later, preferably when it approaches you on its own.</p><p>Don't force the puppy beyond its comfort zone with strangers. Allow the dog to approach new people on its own schedule. Always handle puppies gently. If the puppy is hurt during handling exercises, it may always associate being pet or touched in certain places with the pain. If you do accidentally hurt the puppy, don't make a big deal of it. Instead, continue to gently pet it and give it lots of praise in a happy tone of voice. Coddling the puppy will simply reinforce its fear.</p>",734

Multiple studies prove what puppy lovers already know; they're good for us!</p><h2> Puppies Reduce Stress </h2><p>Puppies can be even more beneficial during times of stress. Your puppy doesn't even have to be present for this ""pet effect"" to work. It's simply enough to know he's waiting at home. Petting and stroking any friendly dog or cat also lowers blood pressure, so if you're pet-less, you could volunteer at the shelter or get your fur fix at a neighbor's home. Petting is especially effective, though, when it's your own animals.</p><p>Infants and children who grow up with puppies and kitties are less likely to develop allergies as they mature. Dogs can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular issues.</p><h2> Puppies Improve Childhood Development </h2><p>Current evidence suggests that overall, pet ownership may be beneficial to child and adolescent emotional, cognitive, behavioral, educational, and social development. There have even been studies by Aline and Robert Kidd that show youngsters from pet-loving families score higher in cognitive, social, and motor development. Another researcher, Robert Poretsky, developed the Companion Animal Bonding Scale. The higher preschool children scored on this measurement tool, the higher their scores also were in all measures of development and empathy.</p><h2> Puppies Reduce Doctor Visits </h2><p>In a survey by British researcher Dr. James Serpell showed it that only one month after getting a dog or a cat, senior citizens had 50 percent fewer minor medical problems such as painful joints, hay fever, insomnia, constipation, anxiety, indigestion, colds and flu, general tiredness, palpitations or breathlessness, back pain, and headaches.</p><p>People who have suffered a heart attack-and own pets-recover more quickly and survive longer than heart attack survivors without pets. And those of us who live with a beloved puppy or other pet experience only half as much blood pressure increase when stressed, as those without a pet.</p><h2> Puppies Increase Exercise </h2><p>Keeping up with the new puppy can be a challenge. Chasing him around the house and yard, though, has other benefits.</p><p>Part of the pet effect has to do with increased exercise. Dogs won't take ""no"" for an answer or let you sleep late if the food bowl is empty, and you can't ignore the puppy's needs the way you can a membership at the gym. Exercise relieves anxiety, boredom, and depression. Set aside time every day to play with your puppy and you'll feel better for it.</p><p>Pets keep us connected socially, too. Walking the dog or talking about your puppy at the pet food aisle at the grocery encourages contact that keeps us interested in life and other people.</p><h2> Puppies Relieve Pain and Anxiety </h2><p>Positron emission tomography (PET scan) is an imaging test that helps physicians to detect biochemical changes used to diagnose and monitor various health conditions. These tests show that touching a pet shuts down the pain-processing centers of the brain. Petting your puppy relieves your own pain and also buffers anxiety, all without the side effects of Valium. In other words, a puppy on your lap can ease your pain.</p><p>We often refer to ""the bond"" when talking about the love we feel for our pets. Science can actually measure this pet effect because thought and attitudes are influenced by changes in brain chemicals. These chemicals prompt feelings of elation, safety, tranquility, happiness, satisfaction, even love.</p><p>Of course, if your puppy is a juvenile delinquent pooch that needs more training, he may raise your blood pressure by chewing illegal targets or having potty accidents in the house. But all the aggravation is worth it. Never discount how this pet effect impacts you and your puppy. Consider getting a puppy to be a furry prescription, and you'll both qualify for the health benefits.</p>",720

Some dogs are fine with an occasional walk while others need long, regular jaunts around the neighborhood. Knowing why walks can benefit dogs and how often your specific dog needs to be walked can help you keep your dog happy and healthy both physically and mentally.</p><h2> Benefits of Walking Your Dog </h2><p>When you take your dog for a walk, you're providing more than just exercise to help manage its weight.</p><p>Taking your dog for a walk can also provide you the same physical and mental benefits, so it is a great way for both you and your dog to spend time together.</p><h2> How Often Should You Walk Your Dog? </h2><p>Your dog's breed, fur, size, age, health status, and other factors will affect how much it should walk. Some dog breeds are physically not able to walk as much as others, so it's important to know what your dog needs and can tolerate. As a basic rule of thumb, a daily walk of 20-30 minutes is a good starting point to assess how much walking your dog can do.</p><p>Working and sporting breeds of dogs are bred to be very active, so daily walks are a must for German shepherds, Belgian malinois, collies, Labrador retrievers, and other athletic breeds. These dogs may require an hour or two of brisk walking or hiking each day. Breeds that aren't bred to work or compete, such as English bulldogs, pomeranians, chihuahuas, and shih tzus, don't need to walk nearly as much. These breeds are often content just being house dogs and may not need to be walked at all.</p><p>Dogs with dense fur or short legs may have a hard time taking long walks. Movement and breathing may be more difficult with these dogs so walks should be kept to 20 minutes or so if the weather is mild. Warmer temperatures will cause a dog to become overheated more quickly, so some summer days may not allow for a walk at all but cooler weather may allow for short jaunts. On the other hand, for dogs with short fur that can normally withstand long walks, extreme cold temperatures will limit the amount of time that they should spent outside.</p><p>Finally, age and disease may play a role in how much walking your dog can and should do. Older dogs may not be able to exercise as long as younger dogs and various diseases, like arthritis, heart disease, and obesity can greatly limit the length of your walks. Sometimes 10 minutes is all these dogs can handle at a time.</p><h2> How Much Walking Is Too Much? </h2><p>If you're not sure how long to walk your dog each day, monitor them for signs of tiredness during your next walk. Panting, slowing of pace, and trying to stop or sit down are signs that your dog has had enough walking for the time being. Their stamina may build after you regularly provide these short walks but continue to monitor your dog if you attempt to lengthen your walks. If after 30 minutes your dog is still happy and keeping a good pace, a longer walk is most likely needed. Alternatively, a second, or even third walk in the day may be necessary, or a more strenuous walk that includes going uphill or placing a dog backpack on your dog could help to exert more of its excess energy.</p><p>Too much walking can cause difficulty breathing, dehydration, overheating (in warm weather), frostbite (in cold weather), leg soreness, leg injuries, and paw pad trauma. If lengthy walks are demanded by your dog, make sure you are prepared for the elements, bring water, and protect your dog from the heat and cold by using paw protection and/or coats. Knowing how much walking is ideal for your specific dog can prevent these issues from occurring and help keep it fit and mentally stimulated.</p>",708

Of course, this isn't an instinctual activity, so you'll have train your puppy to use a peed pad. Consistency is key to this training technique, which you can then use to also teach your puppy to eventually potty outside. Potty training a new puppy can be difficult if you don't know what to do, but there are several aids you can use to help your puppy go potty where you want it to go.</p><h2> Choosing a Potty Pad </h2><p>The idea behind using a potty pad is to provide a visible, consistent area for your puppy to go potty. You'll want to choose something that is absorbent, easy to clean up, and large enough for the messes that your specific puppy makes. Large breed dogs may need heavy duty options compared to toy breeds. Newspapers, paper towels, cloth towels, and store-bought pee pads or indoor/outdoor carpet potty stations are all options.</p><p>Newspaper and paper towels can be messy and difficult to clean up after your puppy potties on them, but they are inexpensive. Cloth towels are absorbent but will need to be washed regularly, and your puppy is more likely to try to chew on it like a blanket or toy. Store bought pee pads are the most popular option due to their absorbency, size options, and ease-of-disposal. If you plan to train your small dog to use the potty indoors, then indoor/outdoor carpet potty stations specifically designed for dogs are good options.</p><h2> Introduce Your Puppy to the Potty Pads </h2><p>Allow your puppy to see and sniff the potty pads you chose. This will help it get used to the new item so it isn't scared of it at potty time. Let your puppy walk on the pad while you repeat a consistent command that you plan to say at potty time, such as ""go potty.""</p><h2> Anticipate When Your Puppy Will Potty </h2><p>While potty training your puppy, you'll need to keep them close by so that you can anticipate when they are about to go potty.</p><h2> Reward Your Puppy </h2><p>Praise and treats work wonders with puppies. If your puppy goes potty on its potty pad, make sure you immediately praise it. This can be verbal in an excited tone of voice, by petting your puppy, or by giving it a special, soft treat reserved only for potty time.</p><h2> Be Consistent </h2><p>Keep your puppy on a regular schedule. This will make it easier for you to anticipate when your puppy may need to potty.</p><p>Say the same command phrase each time.</p><p>Keep the potty pad in the same place until your puppy starts going to the potty pad by itself. Once your puppy knows what to do on the potty pad, you can slowly move it closer to the door or outside where you want your puppy to eventually use the bathroom without the use of the potty pad.</p><h2> Training Mistakes to Avoid </h2><p>Do not encourage your puppy to pull or chew on the potty pad, eat food on it, or play on it. This may confuse your puppy as to what the purpose of the potty pad is.</p><p>Do not move the potty pad around until your puppy knows what it is for and is going potty on it consistently.</p><p>Be sure to find and use a treat that your puppy is really excited about getting. This will help with the training process.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>If your puppy isn't making it to the potty pad on time, try putting it closer to where it usually plays or eats, and then slowly move it closer to the door if you aim to eventually teach it to potty outside.</p><p>If your puppy seems to be constantly urinating, talk to your veterinarian about potential problems that some puppies are known for having.</p>",661
140,https://www.thesprucepets.com/when-to-stop-feeding-puppy-food-5119527,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>When to Stop Feeding Your Dog Puppy Food</h1>,"<h1>When to Stop Feeding Your Dog Puppy Food</h1><p>Proper nutrition is an important part of caring for puppies and adult dogs. Most owners know that puppies need food specifically made to promote growth and development. However, many owners struggle to determine when the time is right to switch to adult dog food. This is because there is no rule that applies to all dogs. Different dogs grow at different rates. You and your vet can estimate the best time to make the change to your puppy's diet.</p><h2> Feeding Puppy Food </h2><p>Puppies need more calories than adult dogs to support their growth, development, and high energy levels. Young puppies need about twice the number of calories as adult dogs of the same size. As your puppy approaches adulthood, his growth begins to slow and his caloric needs decrease. If you continue to feed puppy food once your dog stops growing, it will result in weight gain. Excess weight can quickly turn into obesity, which can lead to a host of health problems.</p><h2> When to Switch to Adult Food </h2><p>In general, dogs are considered puppies until about one year of age. However, different breeds age at different rates. For example, many large and giant breed dogs are considered puppies until two or more years of age and will therefore need to remain on puppy food beyond age one. Conversely, some small dog breeds reach adult size before the age of one. Your veterinarian is the best source of information when it comes to your dog's diet, so ask for advice before making the switch to adult food.</p><p>When deciding on the right time to feed adult dog food, the goal is to switch to adult food around the time the puppy stops growing but before he starts gaining excess weight. Keep track of your puppy's weight and height and look for the numbers to increase at a slower rate. Most dogs will begin to reach a plateau around one year of age, but you might notice the growth slow down as early as eight or nine months of age.</p><h3> Assessing Your Dog's Weight </h3><p>Be aware that weight gain does not necessarily indicate growth. If your dog is gaining weight but not getting taller or more muscular, he may be getting overweight.</p><p>Very prominent ribs and a very small waist may mean your dog is underweight. Visit your vet for an exam to be sure.</p><p>If your dog is less than a year old and seems to be gaining weight, you may need to simply reduce the portion size or frequency of meals before you switch to adult food. Vets recommend feeding young puppies three times per day. However, most puppies can go down to meals a day when they are approaching adulthood.</p><h2> How to Make the Diet Change </h2><p>Any diet change should be done gradually to avoid gastrointestinal upset. This process can take a week or two depending on how you do it.</p><p>It may take some time and research to choose the right food for your now-adult dog. You may wish to stick with the same brand of food but switch to an adult formula. Of course, your vet can help you find an appropriate diet.</p><p>Once you have chosen the adult dog food, determine the portion size of adult food you will eventually need to feed based on your dog's current weight. Then, add a small percentage of adult food to the puppy food, increasing it a little at each meal. For simplicity, you may want to work out a schedule so you are not trying to remember how much of each to feed.</p><p>During the switch, watch your dog's appetite and bowel movements. Slow the transition if your dog experiences diarrhea or vomiting. If GI upset continues, you may need to choose a different adult diet and re-start the transition. Contact your vet if your dog has vomiting or diarrhea for more than a day.</p><p>Watch your dog's weight over the coming months to make sure you don't need to adjust portion times. Also, be sure to keep up with annual or biannual veterinary wellness check-ups as recommended by your vet.</p>",684
141,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puppy-grooming-nail-clipping-2804785,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Cut Your Puppy's Nails</h1>,"<h1>How to Cut Your Puppy's Nails</h1><h2>Equipment, When to Trim, and Easing Fear</h2><p>Essential dog grooming includes clipping the nails, and it should start when your dog is a puppy. Active dogs that run outside naturally wear the nails to a manageable length, and may not need frequent trimming. But those that spend much of their time inside require monthly or more frequent nail attention. The toenails of some breeds, like the Chihuahua, seem to grow quickly. Don't wait until your dog gets big and turns nail trims into wrestling matches. Teach puppies while small that nail trims are a normal part of life and nothing to fear.</p><h2> Why Nail Care Matters </h2><p>Overgrown nails can become caught in bedding and carpets. They may curl as they grow, and embed into the tender flesh of the paw pad. Claws can split or tear as in the picture and need surgical repair that's pricey and painful. Overgrown nails cause the foot to spread or splay, and can change your puppy's gait. Dewclaws on the inside of the lower leg need particular attention since they never contact the ground. Keeping the toenails trimmed also helps reduce inappropriate digging and risk of ringworm.</p><h2> When to Trim </h2><p>Nails at their longest should just clear the ground when the puppy stands in place. If you hear ""clicking"" over the linoleum like a tap-dancer, the nails need a trim. Your groomer or veterinarian can trim your dog's nails at routine visits, but it's easy enough to do yourself.</p><h2> Nail Care Equipment </h2><p>Commercial nail trimmers are scissor-action or guillotine style. For tiny puppies, you can start with human nail clippers, but eventually will need clippers designed to cut the dog's toenails at the proper angle without splitting or crushing the nail. Dremel-type nail grinder products work well for some dogs. They grind off a small amount of the nail at a time and so may take longer to use.</p><p>Choose a style that you feel comfortable using. Dog nails may also need to be filed after trimming. Use an emery board or a nail file available from a pet supply store to smooth the edges, and keep them from getting caught in the carpet.~</p><h2> Paw Handling Socialization </h2><p>Many puppies hate having their paws touched. Handle your pup's feet routinely during play and petting, and reward your pet with petting and treats when it puts up with it. That helps socialize it to being handled by you and future handling by the vet. Begin simply by touching each paw, one after the other. When the puppy allows this without pulling away, gently hold a paw for five seconds and releasing-again with the reward for tolerance.</p><p>Next, hold a paw and touch the nail clipper to a nail-but don't clip it. Do this several times, and reward the dog for not struggling or pulling away. Stop before the dog gets fussy so you leave it with a good memory of the experience.</p><h2> How to Clip Your Dog's Toenails </h2><p>Once your dog is used to the idea of you holding a paw and touching the nail, trim just the tip of the nails.</p><p>You need to avoid the quick the nails, where there are living blood vessels that feed the nail bed. Cutting into those results in pain and bleeding. When the nails are white or clear, the pink quick is visible and makes it easy to avoid the danger zone. If your pup's nails are dark or opaque, clip off only the hook-like tip that turns down. Tipping the nails will prompt the quick to draw back up, so you can trim a little each week until reaching the proper length.</p><p>If you do happen to quick a nail, stop. Use a styptic pencil or corn starch and direct pressure to stop the bleeding, or rake the claw through a bar of soap. Give the pup extra attention or treats to show that even if something uncomfortable happens, there is compensation.</p><p>After the nail is trimmed, throw a puppy party. Tell your dog what a good dog it is, and play a favorite game to show how pleased you are. Reserve a special treat that the dog gets only after a successful nail trim, and soon you'll have your pooch begging for a pedicure</p>",704
142,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hypothermia-in-puppy-dogs-2804959,Dogs > Getting Started > Puppies,<h1>How to Recognize and Treat Hypothermia in Puppies</h1>,"<h1>How to Recognize and Treat Hypothermia in Puppies</h1><p>A fur coat doesn't make puppies immune to hypothermia, a condition when the pet's body temperature falls below normal. Puppies normally conserve body heat by seeking shelter, curling up, and fluffing their fur to trap warm air next to the skin. A short-haired puppy, though, doesn't have much protection; however, shivering generates heat. In cold weather, a puppy's body diverts blood circulation from the ear tips, toes, and tail to the central part of the body. Prevention is the best policy, and the best prevention is to keep pets indoors during inclement weather.</p><h2> Normal Body Temperature </h2><p>In adult dogs, normal temperature ranges from about 100 degrees F to 102.5 degrees F. Very young puppies-those under about 6 weeks of age-have trouble maintaining body temperature. That's why they hunker down next to mom and sleep in puppy piles with their siblings. Huddling together cuts down on wind loss of heat, and the multiple furry bodies can share and boost each others' warmth, avoiding a cold puppy.</p><h2> Outdoor Dangers </h2><p>Pets who live outside during the coldest months are at the highest risk of hypothermia, but even moderately cool temperatures can be dangerous. A 20 mph wind makes 40-degree weather feel like 18 degrees. The wind strips away that layer of warm air trapped by fur next to their skin. That can make even moderate temperatures dangerous. If it rains or snows and soaks your puppy, wet fur chills the pet even more.</p><h2> Mild to Moderate Hypothermia </h2><p>Mild hypothermia occurs when body temperature falls between 90 degrees to F to 99 degrees F and causes pets to act a bit sluggish and lethargic. You'll see muscle tremors and shivering.</p><p>Bring the puppy inside, dry him off, and turn up the heat and he should recover with no problem. If you can't get the pet someplace warm, try putting him inside your clothing to share your body heat.</p><p>Moderate hypothermia is defined as a temperature between 82 degrees F to 90 degrees F. These pets can also be treated at home but may take longer to recover. Wrap him in a towel or blanket that's been heated in the clothes dryer, or wrap a heating pad in a blanket or towel and apply it to the dog.</p><h2> Severe Hypothermia </h2><p>Severe hypothermia, which is a body temperature less than 82 degrees F, can be deadly. Pets lose the ability to shiver if their body temperature falls to 90 degrees F or below, so a still puppy is a warning sign of hypothermia. The dog might fall unconscious while breathing and heart rate slows to the point the puppy may appear dead. Sometimes CPR or rescue breathing is necessary, but you should avoid moving the puppy to prevent additional heat loss.</p><p>Any pet suffering from severe hypothermia-that is, body blue and cold, and unable to shiver-needs immediate veterinary care. When body temperature has been below 90 degrees F for more than 30 minutes, ""core rewarming"" is necessary, which refers to warming the pet from the inside using specialized veterinary techniques.</p><p>Dry the puppy off, and wrap him in warm blankets. During the car ride to the emergency room, it may be helpful to apply a hot water bottle that's been wrapped in a towel to his groin area because the femoral artery lies close to the surface of the skin. The hot water bottle applied to this area can help warm the blood so it circulates and speeds up his re-warming.</p><p>Pets in severe hypothermia risk shock. Rub a bit of Karo syrup or honey on the puppy's gums. The sugar is absorbed through the tissue, and that may help raise his blood sugar levels and counter the risk of shock.</p><h2> Veterinary Treatment </h2><p>Your veterinarian may treat severely hypothermic pets with warm intravenous fluids, warm water enemas, airway rewarming using oxygen or even heart/lung bypass machines that warm the blood. Even with treatment, the prognosis is guarded in cases of severe hypothermia because organs and tissues are often irreparably damaged.</p><p>Pets that have suffered hypothermia in the past are at greater risk in the future for a relapse. Damage caused by the extreme cold reduces the body's ability to stay warm.</p>",694

Professional groomers are a great way to keep your dog's coat clean and well-kept, but they can be expensive and some groomers may book out far in advance. Here are ways that you can trim up your dog's unique coat at home in between visits to the grooming salon.</p><h2>Smooth Short Coats</h2><p>Smooth coated dogs include breeds such as Beagles, Boxers, Boston Terriers, Pugs, and Bulldogs. They are probably the least high maintenance when it comes to grooming, but that doesn't mean grooming isn't essential for them.</p><p>Brush your smooth coated dog out with a bristle brush, making sure that you are brushing with the direction of your dog's fur. While daily brushing is by no means a requirement for smooth coats, regular brushing can keep this type of coat free of dirt and debris. That's it! Most smooth coated dogs don't need to have their already-short hair cut.</p><h2>Double Coats</h2><p>Double coated dogs include a variety of breeds from a variety of breed groups. Huskies and Malamutes, Labrador and Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, Bernese Mountain Dogs, even Corgis and Shetland Sheepdogs are all double coated breeds. A double coat on a dog is characterized by a soft undercoat for insulating and a top coat that repels water.</p><h3>Brush Tangles First and Use Proper Tools to Brush Each Coat</h3><p>Brush any tangles and mats out with a slicker brush, starting outward from the skin to brush out the undercoat. From there, use the slicker brush to brush with the lay of the top coat. If your double coated dog happens to also have long fur, an undercoat rake is also a handy tool to have in your at home kit. Take your time with the brushing, working in sections at a time to ensure no spot on your dog is missed. Brushing should be done regularly to semi-regularly with double coated dogs.</p><h3>Cut Stubborn Snarls or Problematic Mats</h3><p>If your double coated dog has longer fur, use either straight grooming shears or rounded safety tip scissors to cut out any stubborn snarls. Start in the feathering on their legs and around their tail base area first. These areas tend to get the dirtiest the fasted. Using a fine tooth comb, such as a flea comb, pull the fur away from the skin and snip the fur.</p><h3>Do a Sanitary Clip, if Necessary</h3><p>If your double coated dog has some particularly stubborn dirt around his rectal area, you can do what's sometimes called a 'sanitary clip'. With a pair of clippers, shave around your dog's rectal area, being careful not to actually clip your dog's skin. Working slowly to shave large mats and tangled debris out will also help to prevent you from giving your dog clipper burn.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If you must give your double coated dog a sanitary clip that is fine, but never, ever clip a double coated dog down to the skin all over. Both layers are vitally essential for your dog.</p><h2>Long Coats</h2><p>While some double coated dogs can also have long fur, their coat maintenance is not the same as a dog with long fur but only a single coat. Dog breeds that fit this category include breeds such as Yorkshire terriers, havaneses, malteses, shih tzus, and lhasa apsos.</p><p>Most owners of long coated dogs choose to keep their dog groomed in what is termed a ""puppy cut."" This is essentially a close-cropped hair cut for your dog. If you want to maintain your long coated dog's puppy coat in between grooming visits, you may want to invest in a good pair of electric clippers and snap-on guide combs. When it comes to clipper blades, there are different numbers that denote how close (or not close) to the skin the clippers will cut the fur. Generally the higher the number, the shorter the fur. Using a clipper blade in conjunction with a snap-on guide blade allows you to give your dog a longer coat than a blade alone.</p><h3>Brush Fur Out</h3><p>Long breed dogs can either have coarse fur or smooth fur. If your dog's coat is more coarse, ensure that you brush their fur out with a pin brush and a smooth bristle brush.</p><h3>Start Shaving</h3><p>Starting along the back, shave your dog moving the clippers from your dog's shoulder blades toward his tail. Slowly work your way around your dog's sides and chest/belly, clipping in the same direction. From there, shave your dog's legs with the clippers moving from the shoulder/hip down toward the paw.</p><h3>Adjust for Fur Between Your Dog's Toes</h3><p>For the long fur between your dog's toes, you can actually pull the fur up in between each toe so that it sticks straight up and clip it that way. This is far easier than trying actually clip in between the toes and you will be far less likely to accidentally clip your dog or give your dog clipper burn.</p><h2>Wire Coats</h2><p>Also called broken coats, wire coated dogs include such breeds as fox terriers, Scottish terriers, and cairn terriers. In fact, some breeds can actually have a wire coat variety. These include dachshunds, German wirehair pointers, and Jack Russell terriers.</p> <h3>Trim Debris or Tangles From Hair</h3><p>Wirehair breeds tend to have a 'beard' around their muzzle. Using a pair of round safety tip scissors to trim out any food particles of tangles from their water bowl might be necessary. With a fine tooth comb, such as a flea comb, pull the fur away from your dogs face and snip with a pair of round safety tip scissors. However, as with long haired dogs, you want to be careful when scissoring around your dog's face. If your dog isn't comfortable having his beard trimmed, just clean it up as best you can until you can get your dog in to your groomer's.</p><h3>Cut Hair Using an Electric Clipper or Comb, Then Shave Legs</h3><p>If your wire coated dog happens to have a longer coat or if his coat is matted, you can clip it with a pair of electric clippers and snap-on guide combs. Start along your dog's back, working from the shoulder blades down toward the tail. Slowly make your way around your dog's sides and onto his chest/belly. From there, shave his legs with the clippers, moving from the shoulder/hip area down towards the paws.</p><h3>Adjust for Fur Between Your Dog's Toes</h3><p>If he has long fur between his toes, you can pull that fur up so that it is sticking straight up above his toes to then clip it off. This is much easier for you (and safer for your dog) than trying to clip in between the toes from underneath.</p><h2>Curly Coats</h2><p>Keeping your pup's coat cut short can prevent tangling and matting. You can keep their curls tamed and in control with a fine tooth comb, such as a flea comb, to pull the fur away from your dog's skin and then a pair of straight grooming shears.</p><h3>Cut Hair</h3><p>If you curly coated dog's locks are much too long from a simple pair of grooming shears, a pair of electric clippers may be in order. Using these in conjunction with a pair of snap-on guide combs, begin clipping your dog along their back, moving from the shoulder area down towards the tail. Slowly work your way around your dog's body and then on to their chest/belly area. From there, shave their legs by clipping from the shoulder/hip area down towards the paw.</p>",1252

Speak to your vet to know how often your dog should be washed. </p><h2> Before You Begin </h2><p>Proper preparation can make the bathing process easier for you and your dog.</p><p>A tub is usually the easiest place to bathe your dog, though very small dogs may be bathed in a sink. If you will be using your tub at home, it might take a toll on your back and knees and leave a mess to clean up. Some pet supply stores offer self-service dog wash tubs you can use for a small fee. It's less expensive than paying for a groomer and you can avoid a mess in your house.</p><p>If you choose to bathe your dog outside, remember that cold water is no fun for most dogs. In addition, cold water will also not clean your dog as well. Make sure the weather is warm so your dog doesn't get too cold, or use heated water so your dog can get a nice warm bath.</p><p>If you pay for the use of a self-service dog wash, these supplies may be ready and available for your use. If you bathe your dog at home, be sure to gather your supplies in advance so you don't have to scramble for things later.</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3> Prepare Your Dog for the Bath </h3><p>Brush your dog out before you start the bath. Be sure to remove any tangles or mats as these are harder to deal with once your dog is wet. Then apply a strip of artificial tears ointment or a few drops of mineral oil to each eye. This will help protect the eyes from shampoo.</p><h3> Get Your Dog Wet </h3><p>Soak your dog from head to toe with warm water. This works best if using a hand-held sprayer, but you can also pour water from a pitcher or bucket. Always test the temperature on your arm before putting it on your dog.</p><p>Many dogs have water-resistant coats, so a thorough soaking is usually necessary to penetrate the hair. Be sure to avoid the eyes and inside of the ears. Your dog will instinctively want to shake the water off. Keeping a hand on the top your dog's head may help prevent this.</p><h3> Shampoo Your Dog </h3><p>Apply shampoo to your dog's coat. Avoid the eyes, face, and genital area. Use enough shampoo to create a lather. Apply small amounts of shampoo at a time to avoid using too much. One option is to mix two parts shampoo with one part water so that a more liberal amount can be applied. Add the mixture to a spray bottle or a large plastic cup for easier application. Remember to use caution around the face and eyes.</p><h3> Scrub and Massage </h3><p>Rub, scrub, and massage your dog for several minutes. You can use your fingers, just like shampooing your own hair. Your dog will probably actually enjoy this part. Remember to clean the feet, too. Ideally, you should allow the shampoo to remain on your dog's coat for 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing, especially if it's medicated shampoo. Take this time to clean your dog's ears.</p><p>You can also use a rubber or plastic dog scrubbing tool with small nubs made especially for bathing a dog. It provides an extra massage for your dog's skin and helps lather up the shampoo.</p><h3> Rinse Your Dog </h3><p>Apply a stream of water to your dog's coat, avoiding the eyes and ears. Thoroughly rinse all shampoo out of your dog's coat. A shower sprayer works best for this; rinsing with a cup, pitcher, or bucket will take longer.</p><p>Remember to thoroughly rinse the feet and any skin folds or crevices on your dog. It is very important to remove all shampoo residue from your dog. After initially rinsing your dog with warm/hot water, use lukewarm or slightly cool water to help remove shampoo residue and close pores.</p><h3> Dry Your Dog </h3><p>First, stand back and let your dog have a few good shakes. Then, towel-dry any excess water from your dog's coat. Lay a towel on the ground and let your dog go for it. Many dogs will instinctively rub on the towel and continue to shake off the water. Then, you can follow with some more towel-drying.</p><p>If your dog tolerates it, you may want to try blow-drying. Be sure to use a dryer with very low or no heat. If you bathe your dog at a self-service tub, a forced-air dryer might be available. Careful, these dryers are powerful. Only turn it up as high as your dog tolerates, and stay away from the face, eyes, and ears.</p><p>Once your dog is completely dry, thoroughly brush out the coat. Wipe any greasy film from around your dog's eyes with a damp cloth. Try to keep your dog from going outside until dry, otherwise, you'll have a dirty dog again in no time.</p><h2> Preventing Problems With Your Dog During the Bath </h2><p>Some dogs may just absolutely hate the bath. It may feel like a wrestling match or be so messy and time consuming that you want to give up. If this is the case, it may be time to visit a groomer. Professional groomers are recommended for certain breeds that have long hair that needs regular clipping. If you are determined to give at home baths, keep trying and arm yourself with dog treats. </p>",943
145,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hollow-nails-in-dogs-3977029,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Grooming,<h1>Nail Problems in Dogs</h1>,"<h1>Nail Problems in Dogs</h1><p>Ruby Shmank / Unsplash</p><p>Dogs use their nails for a variety of purposes. Most importantly they provide traction and stability when standing, walking, and running. They also help when it comes to activities like play, digging, and grasping objects.</p><p>Ensuring your dog's nails are kept at an appropriate length and feeding them a balanced and nutritious diet can help to prevent problems from developing, but injuries, diseases, and infections are still possible.</p><p>Serious nail problems can significantly impact your dog's quality of life. Nail pain in dogs is typically worse than in humans because dogs put weight on their nails while walking. Early detection can make treatment easier and help to prevent ongoing pain and discomfort for your dog.</p><h2> The Anatomy of a Dog's Nail </h2><p>Dog nails contain a blood vessel and nerve encased in thick, hard keratin. The part inside the nail with the blood vessel and the nerve is often called the ""quick."" The nerve and blood vessel of the nail typically ends before the keratin shell, so you may note the rest of the nail is hollow or even filled with dirt. The place where the nail exits the digit of the paw is called the nail bed.</p><h3>Signs of Nail Problems in Dogs</h3><p>Nail problems in dogs may present in different ways depending on the cause of the problem. Any of the following signs can indicate a problem that requires veterinary attention.</p><h2> Common Causes of Nail Problems in Dogs </h2><p>Problems with dog nails are often caused by injuries, diseases, or even poor nutrition. Some of the more common problems are outlined below.</p><h3> Nail Trim Accidents </h3><p>Many of us have experienced the shock of trimming a dog's nail too closely. It's quite easy to do this ""quicking"" by accident and it results in severing the blood vessel and nerve inside the nail. Heavy bleeding is common and it tends to be very painful to the dog.</p><h3> Nail Injuries </h3><p>Nail injuries are relatively common in dogs. They can easily get caught on things while they are running around, causing the nail to tear or split.</p><p>If you think your dog has a nail injury, take the time to closely inspect the paw. Stop any bleeding and clean the area if your dog will allow you. If only the keratin part of the nail was injured, you should be able to trim off any sharp edges and then monitor the paw.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>A nail injury that affects the quick or nail bed or that appears red, swollen or produces a discharge should be seen by a veterinarian.</p><h3> Nail Infections </h3><p>Dogs can develop paronychia, an infection of the nail bed. However, nail infections may also be related to allergies, other skin problems, injuries, or disorders of the nail. Nail bed infections are usually bacterial or fungal.</p><p>In addition to antibiotics or antifungal medication, treatment for nail infections include various topical and/or oral medications and possibly medicated foot soaks. Some infections take a long time to resolve and require diligent care by both the vet and the owner.</p><p>Food or environmental allergies that cause paw itching and chewing can also be common culprits for resulting nail bed infections. Your dog may need to undergo lifestyle and/or diet changes to reduce the allergic reaction.</p><h3> Poor Nutrition </h3><p>Some common signs that a dog is not getting the right balance of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients in their diet include brittle nails, poor quality of the coat, weight loss, and lethargy.</p><p>Your veterinarian will work with you to come up with a diet plan that helps your dog. Never feed a homemade diet or give supplements without first consulting your vet.</p><h3> Autoimmune disorders </h3><p>Some autoimmune disorders affect the nails while others affect the whole body. It can take some time for vets to diagnose autoimmune disorders as many tests must be performed to determine the problem. Treatment varies based on the disorder but often involves long-term use of immunosuppressive drugs.</p><h3> Tumors </h3><p>Tumors can grow on the paws or nail beds and can impact nail growth. Some of these tumors are cancerous and can be very destructive to the affected area. Your vet may need to take samples and perform radiographs (X-rays) to get a better idea of what is being dealt with. Treatment may involve surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy.</p><h2> How to Prevent Nail Problems in Dogs </h2><p>The best way to prevent a nail problem for your dog is to take good care of them. Keeping nails trimmed short (taking care not to cut the quick) can help your dog avoid injuries. Regular trimming also allows you to look at your dog's nails, potentially seeing a problem before it becomes severe.</p><p>If you notice a nail problem, contact your vet right away for advice. Also, be sure to take your dog to the vet for routine wellness exams once or twice a year as recommended but your vet. Feeding a good quality diet that is complete and balanced according to your vet's standards is also important.</p>",882
146,https://www.thesprucepets.com/tail-docking-in-an-adult-dog-3976991,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Grooming,<h1>Can You Dock the Tail of an Adult Dog?</h1>,"<h1>Can You Dock the Tail of an Adult Dog?</h1><p>Tail docking is a surgical procedure that has historically been performed on newborn puppies. Tail docking in an adult dog is typically only performed if medically necessary and in called a tail amputation.</p><p>Tail docking when done for cosmetic reasons regardless of the age of the animal is controversial. Many breed clubs still consider tail docking for cosmetic reasons a standard for certain breeds, however the practice of docking a dog's tail for cosmetic reasons has long been advised against by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). It may still be considered medically warranted for some dogs. Knowing why tail docking is done and how to prevent unnecessary pain and complications is important for any dog owner to understand.</p><h2> What Is Tail Docking in Dogs? </h2><p>Tail docking is a term used to describe the cutting off of the end or tip of a dog's tail. It consists of cutting between the bones in the tail to shorten its length and the amount of the tail that is cut or ""docked"" will depend on why it is being removed to begin with. Tail docking is a surgical procedure recommended to be done by a veterinarian, regardless of the age of a dog. It is also known as a tail amputation even if only a portion of the tail is removed.</p><h2> Why Do Puppies Get Their Tails Docked? </h2><p>Historically, puppies had their tails docked as newborns because the ancient Romans thought it would prevent rabies and make them better at hunting. We know there is no factual evidence for either of these claims so today it is typically done in puppies for one of two reasons - appearance or to prevent injuries. Certain breeds of dogs are known to look a certain way and tail docking is sometimes done to achieve this look. The AVMA has long lobbied against this rationale for tail docking of dogs.</p><p>Other breeds have tails docked as puppies to help prevent tail injuries in the future. This may be advised for pets that are true working dogs, of those that naturally have very long, slender tails if they aren't docked. These dogs may hurt their tails while running through bushes and trees or from excitedly wagging their thin tails against a hard surface. In those select cases, the vet may advise the tail to be docked as puppies to help prevent these injuries from occurring when they are adults.</p><p>Some dog breeds that you may see docked tails in, include: doberman pinschers, rottweilers, various spaniels, Yorkshire terriers, German shorthaired pointers, poodles, schnauzers, viszlas, Irish terriers, airedale terriers, and others.</p><h2> Why Do Adult Dogs Get Their Tails Docked? </h2><p>If an adult dog needs its tail docked it is because it has an injury or other medical reason for the amputation. Dogs can injure their tails or develop issues with them, such as tumors, that are out of your control but require them to be docked as adults. Tail docking also known as tail amputation in adult dogs should not be done simply for aesthetic reasons.</p><h2> Is Tail Docking Painful? </h2><p>Tail docking is painful even in puppies. Cutting through skin, muscle, nerves, and between bones is never a non-painful procedure, even if a puppy is only 2 days old. It will still feel the procedure but many breeders do it without anesthetics or sedation since the puppies are easily restrained. This is a controversial procedure. Tail docking is painful and should never be performed without anesthesia and by anyone other than a veterinarian.</p><h2> Concerns with Tail Docking </h2><p>Tail docking is not without complications, even if performed by a veterinarian. Tail docking in puppies is much less difficult then tail docking in an adult dog but regardless of the age of the dog when the tail docking is performed, it is at risk for bleeding, unmanaged pain, and anesthetic complications. Other issues can also arise in adult dogs that have their tails docked.</p><p>Puppy tail docking is a more simple process that still requires a cut of the scissors and a few stitches or some skin glue but it is recommended to numb the area prior to the procedure if anesthesia is too high of a risk. This procedure should only be performed by a veterinarian.</p><p>Adult dog tail docking requires general anesthesia and is a more complicated procedure since the bones are fully developed. It is only performed by a veterinarian. Infection, re-injury, and difficulty in healing can all occur since it is difficult to bandage a tail, keep it clean, and prevent a dog from sitting on it.</p><p>Legal concerns also exist with tail docking. In some countries, tail docking is illegal so even breeds of dogs that are known for having docked tails will have long tails due to the legal constraints. This is due to the lack of necessity of tail docking in puppies and is seen as an unethical and purely cosmetic procedure unless it is deemed medically necessary by a veterinarian.</p>",890
147,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-clean-your-dogs-ears-1118393,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Grooming,<h1>How to Clean Your Dog's Ears</h1>,"<h1>How to Clean Your Dog's Ears</h1><p>Ear cleaning is an essential part of your dog's basic grooming routine. All dogs should have their ears cleaned from time to time, but some dogs need more frequent and thorough cleaning than others. This is especially true for dogs prone to ear infections, such as the Bluetick Coonhound. Fortunately, it's easy to clean your dog's ears at home. You just want to ensure to do it properly so you don't do any damage.</p><h3>Watch Now: How to Clean Your Dog's Ears</h3><h3> The Anatomy of a Dog's Ear </h3><p>It's always a good idea to familiarize yourself with your dog's anatomy for grooming care like this. This can help you prevent any damage and get a better understanding of what you're looking at while cleaning. A dog's ear is a fairly complex structure:</p><h2> Preparing to Clean Your Dog's Ears </h2><p>The best place to clean your dog's ears is in the tub or outside. This is a great thing to do just before a bath. Keep in mind that when the dog shakes its head, that ear debris and cleaner has to go somewhere, and that includes your walls and you, so beware. You may wish to wrap a towel around your dog or place one under it to keep it clean and dry. You may also want a towel to keep you dry</p><p>Before cleaning the ears, inspect them. This gives you an idea of how dirty they are and lets you check for excess hair. If your dog has a lot of hair coming from the ear canal, it may need to be plucked. You can do this with your fingers, tweezers, or hemostats. A special ear powder made for dogs may be helpful in gripping the hair. Talk to your groomer or vet's office about how to properly pluck the ears without hurting your dog.</p><h2> What You Need </h2><p>When you are looking for supplies to clean your dog's ears, avoid cleansers that contain alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, as these can cause irritation.</p><h2> Add Ear Cleaner </h2><p>Begin by holding the ear flap up and squirting a few drops of ear cleaner on the inside of the flap near the ear opening. Next, gently place the tip of the bottle into the ear and give it a gentle squeeze.</p><h2> Massage the Ear </h2><p>Before the dog can shake its head, begin massaging the base of the ear (this is the bottom part near the jaw where cartilage can be felt). You should be able to hear a smacking sound.</p><p>By massaging, you are helping the cleanser fill the ridges in the canal and loosen ear debris. After massaging for a few seconds (more for very dirty ears) you can let go and allow your dog to shake. You might want to turn away or hold up a towel for this part.</p><h2> Wipe the Ear Canal </h2><p>Once your dog has a good shake, lightly moisten cotton or gauze with ear cleaner. Use the cotton or gauze with your finger to wipe out the ear canal. You can put your finger in the ear canal as far as it will go without forcing it.</p><p>If the ear still seems dirty, repeat the process. Stop if your dog's ear begins to get red or bleed or your dog seems to be in pain. </p><p>Move on to the other ear and repeat all the steps. Finish by wiping away any visible debris and drying your dog's head off. Make sure to offer a treat reward and plenty of praise.</p><h2> Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>While cleaning, neverput a cotton-tipped applicator into your dog's ear because you may cause damage to the eardrum. The tip of the bottle you use for cleaning also shouldn't go deeper into the dog's ear than you can see. And do not use an excessive amount of pressure when squeezing the cleanser into the ear.</p><p>Regular cleaning can help prevent ear infections. Using an appropriate ear cleaner, you can release wax and debris from the canal and help dry the ear.</p><p>Dogs can build up wax and debris at a faster rate than people. Some dogs have very little ear buildup and simply need their ears wiped out occasionally. Other dogs need thorough ear cleanings every week or two. Inspect your dog's ears regularly and talk to your vet about your dog's needs. Over-cleaning can cause irritation, but under-cleaning can make way for excessive buildup.</p><p>Squeeze a canine ear cleaning solution-easily bought from an online pet retailer or from your vet's office-directly into your dog's ear canal and massage the area for less than a minute. Try to keep your dog still. Then, your dog will want to shake its head to get rid of the solution, so have a towel handy to catch the liquid. (This might be a great project to do outside!) Use cotton swabs or gauze to gently wipe out the residue, never going more than half an inch into your pooch's ear canal.</p><p>Once a month, unless they appear to be dirtier than usual. (And if that's the case, often, maybe you want to see your vet?)</p><p>Yes! A 50/50 solution of vinegar and water works just as well as store-bought solutions.</p>",880
148,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-often-wash-your-dog-4844458,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Grooming,<h1>How Often Should You Wash Your Dog?</h1>,"<h1>How Often Should You Wash Your Dog?</h1><p>One of the most common questions new dog owners have is, ""How often should I bathe my dog?"" This is a valid concern as there are problems with bathing too frequently as well as bathing too infrequently. There are different factors that can influence your dog's bathing schedule. Things like fur length and type, activity level, and any allergies or other skin conditions your dog may or may not have.</p><h2> How Frequently Should My Dog Get a Bath? </h2><p>Truthfully, unless your dog has an underlying skin condition, they don't actually need a bath unless they are smelly or especially dirty. On average, most dogs only need to be bathed on a monthly basis. You can bathe them less frequently, but it is not recommended to bathe any less frequently than every three months. You can also bathe them more frequently, but it is not recommended to bathe any more frequently than every other week. Giving your dog a bath more frequently than every other week can cause dryness and irritation of the skin as well as stripping of the natural oils in your dog's fur.</p><p>Obviously, every other week to every 3 months is a window so narrowing it down to 'once a month on average' is allowing for a big swing in either direction. How can you know if monthly baths are too frequent or infrequent for your dog? One thing that can effect bathing frequency is your dog's normal activity. Does your dog spend a lot of time outside? Do you take your dog hunting or have them participate in field trials? You may need to bathe dogs romping around in the woods and underbrush more frequently than a dog that spends most of their time inside. Does your dog shed a lot or are they considered to be a hypoallergenic breed that doesn't shed? Brushing can help pull out loose fur from your dog's coat to prevent shedding, but bathing can really help pull all that loose fur out. If it's the middle of shedding season, your shedding dog may need more frequent bathing.</p><h2> Different Coats Require Different Care </h2><p>Not all dog breeds have the same type of coat. Dogs with medium to longer fur coats may require baths as often as every other week up to every four to six weeks. Properly maintaining your dog's hair coat by brushing and combing can help you keep your dog's coat clean between baths. The natural oil stripping that can occur from over-bathing can be especially problematic for double-coated dog breeds. These natural oils work to waterproof your dog's coat, allowing for better insulation against the cold and elements.</p><p>There are some dog breeds that have bathing requirements that can actually be a bit surprising based on their coat. Believe it or not, hairless dog breeds, such as the Chinese Crested, the Xoloitzcuintle (pronounced show-low-eats-QUEENT-lee and sometimes called Xolo for short), and the Peruvian Hairless dog can require just as much grooming care as breeds with long fur. These breeds are the exception to the 'no-weekly baths' rule. Due to the oils produced in these breeds' skin, regular bathing is required to prevent oil buildup.</p><p>Dogs with a corded coat, such as a Puli or Komondor don't require as much bathing as you may think. Regular bathing is actually required for these dogs as the cords repel water and it is incredibly difficult to completely rinse out the shampoo and to completely dry the cords. Maintaining the dreadlocks of these breeds does require time and effort, but bathing is definitely not warranted for these breeds.</p><h2> Different Skin Conditions Require Different Care </h2><p>If your dog has a healthy skin and coat and does not have any underlying or concurrent allergies or skin conditions, you can simply use a gentle, over-the-counter pet shampoo. If your dog have any allergies or a skin condition, your vet may recommend a specific shampoo or even prescribe a specific shampoo for you to use. If you take your dog to a groomer to get professionally bathed, you can bring your dog's specific shampoo with them for your groomer to use.</p><p>Human skin, in general, is much less sensitive than your dog's skin. Therefore, a lot of shampoos made for people may be too harsh and irritating for your dog.</p><p>Bathing is a requirement for almost every dog. For more information on how often you should bathe your dog and what shampoo you should use your dog with, talk to your veterinarian.</p>",749

Are you too busy to take care of your dog? Owning a dog is a major responsibility. As a busy person, you can still be a good dog owner, but it will take some effort on your part. Just make sure you are up for the challenge.</p><p>Perhaps you have heard that old saying, ""the busier you are, the more time you have."" Or ""if you want something done, ask a busy person."" There may be some truth in these sayings. Chances are, you make the time to take good care of your dog. It's better for your dog to stay with the family he loves. It's also probably better for you to have a dog in your life. After all, being busy can be stressful, and we all know that pets can help reduce stress.</p><h2>Develop a Routine and Stick to It</h2><p>You're already really busy, so you probably understand the importance of a daily routine. Just make sure you're not forgetting to include dog care in that routine. Make plans for the same time each day to feed, exercise, and bond with your dog. Try to set up regular training sessions as well.</p><p>You will notice that your dog feels more secure and confident when you keep a routine. It tells your dog when it's time to go and when it's time to rest. Your dog will know what to expect and, in turn, will be less anxious and hopefully not so restless. A regular schedule will likely make you feel more organized and disciplined as well. Set up your schedule and live by it.</p><h2>Meet Your Dog's Basic Needs</h2><p>Every dog needs the basics. This includes things like grooming, healthcare, good nutrition, affection and exercise. Make plans to address these things as regularly as needed. Set up a day to groom your dog every few months, or more often, depending on its coat. Schedule veterinary check-ups every 6 to 12 months. Give monthly heartworm prevention and flea prevention on the same day each month (you can set a reminder on your phone or in your personal calendar).</p><h2>Make Exercise a Priority</h2><p>You and your dog both need exercise. Why not combine the two activities and exercise your dog? You can start simple: take a few minutes a day to walk your dog. Or, you can go big and start a running or cycling routine. These daily exercise sessions are sure to benefit both you and your dog.</p><p>No matter what you choose for exercise, find a way to make it happen daily. Your and your dog will enjoy having something fun to look forward to every day. Even if you can't be the one to exercise with your dog, you may be able to find a dog walker in your neighborhood who can help. This may also provide an opportunity for your dog to socialize with other dogs being walked at the same time.</p><h2>Don't Neglect Training</h2><p>Yes, the idea of finding the time to train your dog is probably overwhelming. However, making time to train your dog is easier than you may think. Set a schedule to have 2 to 3 training sessions a week. The sessions should only be 10 to 15 minutes each. Surely you can carve out this kind of time. Training provides mental enrichment for your dog as well as bonding time, and gives your dog structure to help it understand what you want.</p><p>If you need help, find a reputable dog trainer who can do some one-on-one sessions. Some training facilities even offer drop-off services that will allow you to leave your dog for the day while trainers work with him. Another option is to send your dog to board-and-train. Once your dog has a foundation of training, you can hold 2 to 3 training sessions a week just as a refresher.</p><h2>Consider Doggie Daycare</h2><p>Doggie daycare isn't right for all dogs, but it can be an amazing activity for many dogs. Find a reputable doggie daycare with staff that understands canine behavior and ensures that dogs play safely. You can drop your dog off a few days a week on your way to the office. While you work, your dog can be playing all day, expending all that energy, having tons of fun, and getting good and tired out. Pick up your dog on your way home from the office, and the two of you can go home and crash!</p><h2>Find a Playmate for Your Dog</h2><p>Now, I'm not saying you should go out and get a second dog. That could make you feel even busier! However, your dog might benefit from having a playmate if your dog likes other dogs.</p><p>Look at your social circle: do you have friends or family members with dogs that like other dogs? Perhaps you can set up some playdates. If your friend is not quite as busy as you, perhaps you can let your dog stay for the day while you go to work.</p><h2>Hire a Pet Sitter or Dog Walker</h2><p>Many busy people find themselves away from home for 12 hours a day or more. This can make dogs left at home feeling lonely and bored. It's also not very humane to make your dog wait more than 12 hours to use the bathroom. If you have a doggie door, that's great for his bladder, but it still won't help with the loneliness.</p><p>Consider finding a trustworthy pet sitter or dog walker who can come to your home midday and spend a little time with your dog. They can walk around the neighborhood and even spend some time playing.</p><p>Of course, a pet sitter is no substitute for . It's still important that you make time to bond with your dog one-on-one. However, having extra help might be in the best interest of your dog. And there's no shame in asking for help. Just be prepared to pay for it.</p><h2>Take Your Dog To Work</h2><p>Could you take your dog to work? Many businesses recognize that dogs in the workplace can have a positive impact on employee's productivity and attitudes. Depending on where you work, taking your dog to the office could be a real option. Talk to your boss about turning your office into a pet-friendly workplace. It can't hurt to try!</p><p>If you already have a pet-friendly workplace, then what's stopping you? Perhaps your dog's manners are not up to par. if so, there's no time like the present to work on training. Within a matter of weeks, your dog can be workplace ready.</p><p>If you do decide to take your dog to work, be sure to keep it balanced. You will need to remain productive at work so you don't lose the privilege of bringing your dog. Again, here's where a schedule can help. Set specific break times to take your dog out for a potty break and some fresh air. Set up an area in your office or cubicle with a dog bed and some toys.</p><h2>Should Busy People Get Dogs?</h2><p>Do you really want a dog but worry you are too busy? Think about what is fair for the dog. If you truly think you can make the time in your busy schedule, be sure to find the right dog for your lifestyle. Avoid getting a high-energy dog or a dog with special needs or behavior problems. Consider adopting an adult dog with a laid back personality. Set the schedule from day one and hold yourself to it. Your dog deserves it!</p>",1254

It comes with lots of responsibility. To avoid falling into any bad habits, new and experienced dog owners alike should freshen up on etiquette. Are you guilty of making any of these common mistakes?</p><h2>Dismissing Training and Socialization</h2><p>Every dog needs basic training and socialization. Some need more than others, but they all need . If you decide not to train your dog, you are putting it at a disadvantage. How will it know the rules? What kind of structure and guidance are you providing? Don't think of training as a chore. When done positively, training is fun and enriching for dogs.</p><p>Socialization allows a dog to get used to things in the environment, such as children, other adults, other animals, objects, environments, and various situations.

You can socialize your adult dog, too!</p><h2>Not Offering Enough Exercise and Activity</h2><p>Exercise is a basic need for every dog. Lack of exercise can lead to health problems and behavior issues. Some dogs need more exercise than others, but most need more than simple walks.</p><p>Assess your dog's activity needs. Is your dog restless and bored? Does your dog seem hyperactive and excited all the time? Is your dog overweight? These are all signs that it needs more exercise.</p><p>Dogs need mental stimulation, too. Try exercise that involves games to give your dog well-rounded activity. Many dogs will benefit from involvement in dog sports, of which there are plenty to choose from. Physically active dogs might enjoy agility. Hounds and other curious sniffers usually love nose work or tracking.</p><h2>Avoiding the Veterinarian</h2><p>Are you one of those people who wait until your dog is sick to go to the vet? Well, you're not alone. A lot of dog owners skip or put off routine vet visits unless something is going on with their dogs. You may think, ""my dog is healthy and feeling great, why should I stress him out with a vet visit?"" Dog owners often want to avoid the cost and inconvenience of a vet visit.</p><p>Reality check: This is not the best way to treat your dog. Your veterinarian is a key part of keeping your dog healthy. Most dogs will hide illness until it becomes unbearable. Routine wellness exams can allow vets to detect small health issues before they become big problems. These vet visits also help foster the relationship you and your dog have with your vet, making it easier to diagnose and treat illness when it comes along. In addition to wellness visits, you should listen to your vet's recommendation about things such as heartworm prevention.</p><h2>Skipping Heartworm Prevention</h2><p>The American Heartworm Society strongly recommends year-round heartworm prevention for all dogs in all 50 states. Your vet will make the same recommendation, but it's not to turn a profit. It's because heartworm disease is a serious and potentially fatal disease. Caused by an infestation of the parasite , heartworms are transmitted by mosquitoes and can affect any dog anywhere in the United States.</p><p>You may say, ""if heartworm disease can be treated, why bother with costly prevention?"" If you think heartworm prevention is expensive, then you have never needed to pay for heartworm treatment. The heartworm treatment protocol may cost as much as $1,000&ndash;$1,500, and your dog can easily be reinfected in the future. Monthly heartworm prevention will cost about $35&ndash;$250 per year depending on the size of the dog and the brand of prevention.</p><h2>Neglecting Dental Health</h2><p>Many people seem to think ""doggie breath"" is a normal thing. In truth, halitosis is a sign of some kind of dental disease. It may be as simple as some tartar buildup in your dog's mouth. However, left unchecked, this can become periodontal disease, leading to tooth loss and even systemic diseases such as kidney failure and heart disease.</p><p>How can you prevent this? Home dental care is key. In a perfect world, everyone would brush their dogs' teeth daily. In real life, many of us have trouble keeping up with it. If possible, our best option is to commit to a tooth-brushing routine. You can also use a good dental home care product (ask your vet for recommendations), but it won't take the place of brushing. Either way, you should plan for regular veterinary dental cleanings.</p><h2>Feeding Improperly</h2><p>When it comes to feeding your dog, do you know the basics? All dog foods are not created equal. Before buying dog food, check labels and read reviews. Talk to your vet and other dog experts.</p><h2>Failing to Budget for Dog Expenses</h2><p>Dog ownership costs money. Sometimes it's a lot of money. Make sure your budget includes all of the routine costs associated with dog ownership, such as food, dog supplies, and veterinary care. Don't forget extras, such as the need to take a training class or the cost to hire a pet sitter when you travel. If money is tight, you can find ways to save money on dog expenses, but you still need a budget.</p><p>Next, allow for the unexpected. Are you ready in case of an emergency or unexpected injury/illness? Emergency vets cost a lot more than your regular vet, but that's how they can be open at 3 a.m. Even regular vets have to charge a lot for their time in working with medical emergencies and serious medical treatments. To stay in business, veterinary offices need payment at the time of services. Therefore, it's important to have the funds or some kind of plan in place in case you need sudden veterinary care.</p><h2>Letting Behavior Problems Get out of Control</h2><p>Behavior problems in dogs may start small, but most will get worse. Ignoring the issues will let them fester and grow. Worse, you might unconsciously reinforce bad behavior in your dog. Giving a treat to an aggressive dog tells that dog that it is doing the right thing.</p><p>Fear and phobias are also sometimes overlooked or minimized. Phobias tend to get worse over time and can lead to other behavior problems or even health issues. Behavior modification, not punishment, can help to address these issues.</p><h2>Risking a Lost Dog</h2><p>Dogs are lost every day. Some are even stolen. Are you taking the necessary steps to protect your dog? Some things are obvious, such as keeping your dog on a leash and not leaving it unattended. Also, if your dog is lost, do you know what to do?</p><p>Here's one of the worst mistakes owners can make: you put a collar on a dog but neglect to add an ID tag. Your dog should wear a collar at all times with current identification. Also, consider microchipping your dog for an added layer of protection. This can help you become reunited with your dog if it's lost. Otherwise, your dog may become one more homeless pet in an overcrowded shelter.</p>",1156
151,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-choose-the-right-dog-1117320,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>How to Choose the Right Dog for You</h1>,"<h1>How to Choose the Right Dog for You</h1><p>Are you ready to choose the right dog for you? Bringing a new dog into your life is a major decision. First, make sure you are ready for a dog before you start the process. It is also essential that you understand the cost of dog ownership. If you have decided that the time is right, congratulations! Now it is time to figure out what type of dog is right for you.</p><p>There are several factors to consider before you choose a dog. Most importantly, examine your current lifestyle and consider what adjustments you are willing to make for a dog. Look at the needs of your family, especially if you have children, older relatives, or other pets. People with allergies, or those who prefer low-shedding dogs, might want to look into hypoallergenic dog breeds, although some allergy sufferers will still have symptoms with these breeds.</p><p>Next, think about the ideal size, energy level, and age of your new dog. Just remember that getting a dog requires a firm commitment to responsible dog ownership for 10-15 years in most cases. Here are some tips to help you choose the best dog for you and your family.</p><h2> Size </h2><p>You may already know you want a little lap dog that you can carry around, or, you might have your heart set on a large or giant dog breed. If you cannot decide, then perhaps a medium sized dog is a good choice.</p><p>Remember that some small dogs are delicate and more vulnerable to injury. Being stepped on or mishandled can cause serious injury. Also, little dogs can be more sensitive to colder temperatures, so be ready to help keep them warm. They may also need more frequent meals and potty breaks due to their small size, so this can make them more high maintenance than some larger dogs. Don't forget that small dogs need obedience training too! Sometimes little dogs are not trained as consistently since they are easy to pick up and physically remove from difficult situations, however, this can lead to unwanted behaviors, such as growling, nipping, or constantly wanting to be held. Be sure you are prepared for this possibility.</p><p>Very large dogs need a bit more space to move around. Big, happy dogs with long, whip-like tails need ""wagging space"" to avoid tail injury or damage to household objects. Another consideration is the expenses: the larger the dog, the more expensive things like dog food, dog supplies, and medical treatments become. Training is also a key factor here. If you get a large or giant breed puppy that is allowed to act like a lap dog when young, he will grow up to walk all over you, literally!</p><h2> Activity Level </h2><p>You probably already know that some dogs have more energy than others. A dog's activity level is often determined by breed, but it does not mean you can rely on breed alone to determine how energetic your dog could become. Every dog needs routine exercise, regardless of breed or size, so make sure you can provide this daily. If you know you can not commit to more than one or two casual walks per day, then you will probably be better off with a lower energy dog, such as a Basset Hound. If you are looking for a dog that can be a jogging partner, agility competitor, or ""disc dog,"" consider a breed like the Border Collie.</p><p>Be willing to adjust the amount of exercise and attention you give your dog if necessary. A dog that is barking constantly, digging up your yard, destroying your home, or acting out in some other way may need extra activities, mental enrichment, and additional training. Many behavior problems are exacerbated by excess energy. Unfortunately, many dogs are given up or even euthanized because of behavior problems that may stem from lack of socialization, exercise, training and attention, so it is important to do your research and make sure the dog you want is compatible with your lifestyle.</p><h2> Physical Maintenance </h2><p>Your dog's appearance has a lot to do with his maintenance needs. All dogs need basic grooming, but certain types need more based on the type of hair coat. If you get a dog with hair that keeps growing, then advanced routine grooming is essential. Most short-haired, smooth-coated dogs are major shedders, so be prepared to do some extra cleaning up. Some grooming tools can help reduce shedding.</p><p>Be aware that dogs with long, floppy ears are more prone to ear infections and may require frequent thorough ear cleanings. And many small breed dogs are prone to dental disease, which can require costly dental procedures as well as dedicated regular brushing at home. In addition, certain types of dogs can do a lot of drooling. Many owners of Mastiffs, Bloodhounds, and similar dogs actually carry a ""slobber cloth"" with them to wipe the drool. If they shake their heads, watch out!</p><h2> Age </h2><p>Puppies require the greatest amount of training and attention, especially over the first six months. Be prepared to dedicate much of your time to housebreaking and raising your new puppy. Your dog will likely have plenty of accidents in the house and will probably chew your furniture and personal belongings. These problems will gradually resolve with dedicated training, but patience is a must. You should also be aware that your puppy might grow up to be different than you expected, especially if you adopt a mixed-breed dog. This is not necessarily a bad thing, just something to keep in mind.</p><p>Adult dogs can be an excellent choice. An adult might be a better choice if you want to have a good idea of the true energy level, attitude, and temperament of your new dog. Just because the dog is an adult does not mean he is trained, so you should still expect some degree of dedicated training at first. Fortunately, many adult dogs have been trained and socialized to some degree and can easily adjust to their new lives in their forever homes.</p><p>Senior dogs should not be forgotten! Welcoming a senior dog into your home can be a wonderful way to bring joy to the golden years of a dog. Unfortunately, senior dogs are less likely to be adopted and often end up living out their lives in shelters or being euthanized.</p><p>A senior dog can make a wonderful companion if you are looking for a lower energy dog. It is, however, important to know that your senior dog needs special attention, more frequent veterinary check-ups, and is more likely to develop health problems that cost time and money to address. Unlike a puppy or adult dog, you must know that you will not have as many years with your senior dog. If you are willing to accept the responsibilities, consider adopting a senior dog. It can be one of the most compassionate things you can do for these precious creatures.</p><h2> Breed </h2><p>Mixed breed dogs can become wonderful additions to your world. The combination of two or more dog breeds can often balance out their personalities and physical characteristics. Just be sure to expect the unexpected, especially if you adopt a ""pound puppy."" There is no way of knowing exactly how your puppy will look when grown up, and you cannot really predict health problems. Many experts believe that mixed-breed dogs end up with fewer health problems than purebred dogs. Overall they tend to make great companions and are intelligent and one-of-a-kind. Plus, adopting a mixed-breed dog usually means you are saving that dog from euthanasia or a lonely shelter life!</p>",1271
152,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-cats-are-better-than-dogs-554880,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>10 Reasons Why Cats Make Better Pets Than Dogs</h1>,"<h1>10 Reasons Why Cats Make Better Pets Than Dogs</h1><h2>From Their Ease of Care to Their Quiet Nature</h2><p> Dr.</p><p>Many people think that cats are better than dogs. Cats are easy to care for, quiet, and relatively affordable. They even groom themselves. There are certainly benefits to owning a cat that you won't get from owning a dog. Here are 10 reasons that cats are better than dogs.</p><h2> Cats Don't Take up Much Space </h2><p>Ryland Dean / Unsplash</p><p>If you've ever tried to share a bed with a golden retriever-or even a tiny dog-you know they take up a ton of space. Between their size, their love for stretching out into everyone's personal space, the room they need to play and exercise, and their stuff (such as a dog bed or dog toys), dogs need a solid amount of room to live a happy, healthy life.</p><p>Cats, however, don't need a lot of space to thrive. As long as you can fit their essentials, such as litter boxes (you need one box per cat plus one extra) and food and water dishes, you can pretty much guarantee your kitty will be happy.</p><h2> Owning a Cat Is More Affordable </h2><p>Over the course of their lifetimes, cats are generally more affordable than dogs. While buying a specific breed of cat can be expensive, generally, adoption fees are lower for kittens and cats than they are for puppies or dogs-particularly during kitten seasons or times when the shelter has a major influx of kittens. Some shelters may even waive their fees or offer a two-for-one deal on pairs of kittens.</p><p>Once you own the pet, there are plenty of expenses you will have to incur, from supplies to caretakers. Because dogs have a tendency to destroy their toys, they have to be made from much tougher (and much more expensive) materials-or replaced often. Cat toys are relatively cheap to buy and even cheaper (and easy) to DIY.</p><p>Plenty of exercise is absolutely vital to a dog's health, but getting two or three walks a day can be tough when you have a full-time job. Considering the average dog walker charges $15 to $20 for a 20-minute walk, costs can add up quickly. Cats, however, are perfectly content lounging, napping, and playing with their toys at home alone while you work the day away. It's even better if you have two kitties since they'll keep each other entertained.</p><h2> Cats Are Perfectly Content Indoors </h2><p>It's virtually impossible for dogs to have an indoors-only lifestyle; they need a lot of exercise, plenty of walks, and time spent outdoors to live happy and healthy lives. But if you don't have a yard or access to parks, or have limited mobility, this may present a major challenge.</p><p>Not only are cats much safer indoors, but they're perfectly happy perched next to a window or curled up in a sunny spot on the couch. Simply crack a window for some fresh air (but make sure it's not open wide enough for kitty to escape), and your cat will be totally content watching birds and bugs all day long.</p><h2> Cats Are Quieter </h2><p>Even the biggest dog lovers have to admit: Whether your dog is barking at a passerby, another animal, or simply because its favorite toy is stuck under the couch, incessant barking can get pretty annoying.</p><p>While cats certainly do make some noise-especially at night, when many cats are most active-meows and purrs tend to be pretty quiet. Meowing and purring are cute, but even better, you'll begin to recognize what your cat's meows actually mean. You'll learn how to differentiate a meow that means ""I'm hungry"" from a meow that means ""Cuddle me!""</p><h2> Kittens Require Less Work Than Puppies </h2><p>Both puppies and kittens require an incredible amount of time, energy, and attention. Between getting it comfortable in its new home, introducing it to its new diet, and starting some preliminary training, you may be a little bit sleep-deprived during the first few weeks with your new pup or kitten.</p><p>Puppies, however, need ongoing training (especially for potty training), but once kittens are weaned from their mothers and have learned the basics of using the litter box, they can be left at home unsupervised during the day.</p><p>Do you want to be extra safe? Put your kitty in a room where it can't get into mischief while you're gone. It'll keep the kitty wrangled in one safe space and, due to its smaller size, it won't be able to cause much (if any) damage from being contained.</p><h2> Cats Keep Pests at Bay </h2><p>Cats are natural-born hunters, so it's in their DNA to stalk, hunt, and pounce on their prey-even if it's on a television screen. While you should never, ever let your cat eat a bug or mouse it catches, a pest-free home is just one of the many benefits of owning kitties. What's more, your cat's scent alone can keep rodents away from your house; if rodents detect a hunter in the home, they're far less likely to enter.</p><h2> Cleaning the Litter Box Is Easier Than Constant Walks </h2><p>While it may be a little weird that your cat pees and poops in strategically placed boxes all over your house, cleaning out a litter box is fareasier than having to take walks late at night, during scorching summer days, or through freezing snow, all while scooping up dog poop with a plastic bag over your hand.</p><p>Cats are naturally very clean creatures, and one of their instincts is to bury their pee and poop. This hides their territory from predators who, like cats, use their sense of smell to find their prey. Although house cats aren't necessarily being hunted by predators, humans can reap the benefits of neat, clean, and completely covered waste.</p><h2> Cats Clean Themselves </h2><p>Dogs love stuff that smells bad-from garbage, to dead animals, to poop-and they really love to roll around in it. As a result, dogs require routine bathing and grooming, which can get very expensive if you take your dog to the groomer.</p><p>Cats are essentially self-cleaning machines. You may want to groom it with a brush every once in a while and definitelyclip its nails as needed, but otherwise, cats do a very good job of keeping themselves clean.</p><h2> Cats Understand Personal Space </h2><p>Sometimes after a long, stressful day at work, you may not be in the mood to have a dog at your heels, following you around the house, nudging you to play fetch. While cats may get a bad rap for being cold or distant, they really just understand (and appreciate) the concept of personal space. Cats don't require your constant attention or energy, which will give you plenty of opportunities to sit and relax after a long work week.</p>",1176
153,https://www.thesprucepets.com/last-dogs-to-be-adopted-4586942,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>These Dogs Are the Last to Be Adopted</h1>,"<h1>These Dogs Are the Last to Be Adopted</h1>=<p>Are you considering adopting a dog? Fantastic! There are so many deserving dogs that are searching for their forever homes worldwide. Some dogs will have no problem in securing an adoptive family. They may be tiny and cute, perhaps they have been featured in a high profile adoption campaign, or maybe they are a breed that doesn't come up for adoption often.</p><p>Other dogs are no less deserving but, through no fault of their own, are often left languishing in a shelter for months, or even years, at a time. Maybe they are older or poorly, perhaps they are a black dog that does not stand out so much, or they could have an unfair reputation like the Bully Breeds.</p><p>So, if you are thinking about visiting a rescue shelter with intentions to adopt, consider the dogs that are often more difficult to adopt out.</p><h2> Black Dogs </h2><p>It has been a long-held belief that black dogs are the toughest to rehome. Their color means they do not photograph so easily, some people are superstitious about their color, and they don't stand out so well alongside dogs with brighter coats.</p><p>While there is still a lot of anecdotal information from shelters of long-stay black dogs, the positive news is that somestudies indicate that black dogs do not appear to be having as tough a time as first thought. They do not languish in shelters notably longer than any other dogs.</p><p>So, if you are considering adoption, don't overlook the oldies, the disabled, the Bullies, and the pairs. You might just be passing up on the dog of your dreams!</p><h2> Senior Dogs Make Wonderful Companions </h2><p>Many senior dogs tragically end up in shelters. Perhaps the previous owners had to give up their family pet a newborn baby, allergies or they can't devote the time to their pet anymore, or maybe the dog has an ailment that an owner is unable to want to deal with. Whatever the reason, it's awful to think of a dog that has spent its whole life in a home environment suddenly having to cope with the stress of kennel life.</p><p>But the thing is-senior dogs make great pets. They are almost always house trained, tend to be calmer around the home, and are just happy to enjoy a snuggle on the sofa. And senior pets still have plenty of life left in them, too, enjoying their walks and benefitting from some TLC.</p><p>Don't overlook a Golden Oldie; as long as you are prepared to manage more potential medical needs, the rewards of offering them a perfect retirement are huge.</p><h2> Dogs With Behavior Problems </h2><p>Adopting a troubled rescue dog, while requiring patience and commitment, is incredibly rewarding.</p><p>Some dogs may seem like they are aggressive or over-excitable when you see them behind bars in a stressful kennel environment, but once they are in a more relaxed atmosphere, they become a different dog. This can be difficult to assess in a kennel-environment where there are many stressors on the individual. Obtaining a history, if possible, from the shelter is critical for helping prepare for this type of rescue.</p><p>If the dog has had a traumatic past and has some fear and trust issues, with a dedicated and experienced home, they can flourish. Not only will the experience expand your dog behavior knowledge, but it will also help to create a deep bond between you both, seeing them transform from a fearful and reactive dog to one that can relax with those that they love. However, these dogs may also have specific needs to succeed and may not be suited to every situation or home environment.</p><p>Be prepared to seek out additional behavior training services or even a veterinary behaviorist in this situation, and make sure that your home environment will be right for this dog to flourish in. Sometimes a home with more activity, including from children and other pets or transitioning roommates, can be a source of additional stress for some of these individuals.</p><h2> Dogs That Are a Bonded Pair </h2><p>Sometimes the thought of getting just one dog can be overwhelming, so considering taking two at once is not as appealing to many people. This means that dogs that are incredibly bonded and looking for a home together can sometimes struggle.</p><p>Many people go on to adopt a second dog anyway and, at least in this situation, you already know that the dogs will get on well (Plus, there's nothing cuter than seeing two animals snuggle together!). </p><h2> Dogs With Health Problems or Disabilities </h2><p>Dogs that have been born with or develop a disability or illness that end up in rescue can be extremely difficult to home. Making matters worse, often the kennel environment can exacerbate their problems.</p><p>Some dogs with illnesses just need some TLC and the right medication, and they go on to live full and healthy lives. Those with lifelong medical conditions can still go on to have an excellent quality of life with the right treatment. Many charities will also provide financial support for these medically challenged dogs.</p><p>Often, disabled dogs are overlooked, as their needs may seem scary, but they are usually no more challenging to look after than an able-bodied pet. A Tripawd, for example, can manage wonderfully with three legs. And, even if they do need a little extra care, their positive outlook on life and ability to adapt can be hugely inspiring.</p><h2> The Bully Breeds </h2><p>Tragically, Pit Bulls and other Bully Breeds are one of the most frequently found types of dogs in rescue shelters across the United States. Their numbers are so high primarily as a result of backyard breeding, keeping for the wrong reason (as fighting or bait dog or status symbol), the frustrating laws around Breed Specific Legislation, ill-prepared owners for their high energy levels and needs, and an ingrained prejudice from some towards the breed type.</p><p>Truthfully, though, many of these dogs can make wonderful pets in the right home environment.  Like all breeds, Bully breeds have unique characteristics and traits that they have been bred for historically and by having the correct expectations, you can avoid concerns that others may have.</p><p>For dogs that have been used for fighting, there may be behavior concerns that may need to be addressed, extensive training requirements, or an awareness of how they may react to other pets in the home. The shelter may be able to provide you with some history to manage expectations or help to prepare you for specific needs for the individual dog, no matter the breed.</p><p>By responsibly adopting a Bully Breed, not only will you be saving a dog that could spend a long time in the shelter environment, or even euthanized, but you will also become an advocate for the breed, helping to dispel misconceptions.</p>",1115

I might not have a TikTok-celebrity pug with a famously floppy body, but I do have experience managing a social media follower base for someone with paws.I adopted my dog, Simon, from Hearts &amp; Bones Animal Rescue in New York City in August 2021. After fostering four lovable pups-Riverside, Fox, Lucy, and Meadow-of every age, size, and demeanor, I was ready to stop saying goodbye and make my apartment a forever home. I told Hearts &amp; Bones I was ready to switch to the foster-to-adopt track, and the rest was fate.</p><p>The moment I spotted Simon in a pack of dogs from Dallas, I knew he was the one. I'm not sure I believe in love at first sight between humans, but I felt it when I saw a single photo of a stubby-legged, big-eared basset-mix named Sable staring straight into the camera. Less than a week later I ""foster-failed,"" and Sable officially became Simon. From the first day we met, we were inseparable.</p><p>UpperWestSimon / Instagram</p><p>I wasn't the only one who was smitten. Last summer, I posted about my foster dogs on Twitter to increase their visibility for potential adopters, but the reactions to Simon were unlike anything I'd experienced before. ""His ears!!!!"" people squealed in reply to the photos I tweeted throughout the day. ""I love him"" they replied, to which I replied, ""same,"" because I already did. Within a week, I couldn't imagine my life without this goofy short boy and sharing some of the adorable digital material I captured each day became a part of my routine. I live alone and work from home, so it was a treat to share his photos and videos with other people. After all, there are only so many dog pictures you can text your friends on a Tuesday morning before they boot you from the group chat. Why not share the joy he brought me when there was so much of it to go around?</p><p>UpperWestSimon / Instagram</p><p>At first, I was hesitant to create an Instagram account dedicated to Simon. As a professional social media strategist who already spends an obscene amount of her time online, I didn't want yet another reason to have my head in a phone.</p><p> Apparently, I wasn't the only person on the internet with a cute dog named Simon in need of a clever username. </p><p>Over the past few months, as the numbers on Simon's posts began to climb (he is now getting close to 7,000), two things Jonathan Graziano and I talked about kept coming back to me. </p><p>The first is how good it feels to have your dog positively (sorry, pawsitively) affect a stranger on the internet. ""Finding this page was nothing short of luck. I'm obsessed with Simon and needed this page in my life,"" one woman wrote to me after losing her basset hounds of ten years. ""Simon posts are literally one of the best parts of my day, just wanted you to know that,"" wrote another last night. </p><p>UpperWestSimon / Instagram</p><p>Simon is the best part of my day most days, and I love knowing that he makes other people as happy as he makes me. Let's face it: In year three of a deadly global pandemic, there are times when we could all need some help getting through the day. I know that sharing photos of my dog isn't solving the mental health crisis or fixing climate change, but if I can make someone's bad day even 1% better, I'm happy to try. The internet is filled with so much negativity, it means something to me to put positivity back into it. Jonathan and I also talked about how important it is for him to elevate the message of #AdoptDontShop to promote dog adoption through Noodle's accounts. ""The attention is great, the brand deals are great, but the best thing that has come out of all of this is that I think people have adopted dogs because of it. That's the best thing in the world,"" he said.</p><p>UpperWestSimon / Instagram</p><p> I love every dog regardless of whether they came from a rescue or a breeder, but in a city filled with doodle-mixes, I wish more people knew they could adopt their dream dog. Per the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASCPA), 670,00 dogs are euthanized every year in the U.S. Until kill-shelters are no longer a reality I'm going to scream about animal rescue on the internet.Beyond adoption, I hope that Simon and I can promote fostering as not only the most direct way to save an animal's life but also a great way to discover the right dog for your household. Fostering was one of the most rewarding experiences of my adult life, and I know it has the potential to be the same for others. There is nothing that brightens my day like getting a DM from a follower telling me they signed up to foster because of Simon's posts.</p><p>UpperWestSimon / Instagram</p><p>Just last week, as Simon and I approached our six-month anniversary, I emailed Hearts &amp; Bones telling them that Simon is ready to be a foster brother. I've seen him with enough dogs in his space to know he'll rise to the occasion, so we'll soon have a stream of adoptable cuties making cameos in the apartment. I'll do my best to live in the moment, but it won't be long until I unleash a stream of adorableness onto the internet.</p><p>Simon teaching other dogs how to ""dog"" is too good to keep to myself. </p>",959

Each has its pros and cons. You should know what to expect for the first few weeks after your newly adopted dog arrives in your home. The more prepared you are, the more smoothly the transition will go.</p><h2> Preparing to Bring Home a New Dog </h2><p>Before bringing your dog home, make sure you have areas set up where it can feel safe and that your home is adequately dog-proofed. The dog should have access to its bed, food and water bowls, and toys. If you plan to crate train, be sure the crate is ready as well.</p><p>If your new dog has a special item (such as a toy, bed, or blanket) from its foster home or shelter, find out if you can take it home. This can help make your home feel familiar.</p><h2> What You Need </h2><p>You will need a few basic dog supplies ahead of time so you don't have to run to the store at the last minute, and can spend time with your new pup.</p><h2> Prevent a Lost Dog </h2><p>Have a collar and ID tag with your phone number made in advance. Bring it with you when you pick up your new dog.</p><p>Worst case scenario, if the dog runs off or wanders away, it will not likely be able to find its way back to your home. Remember, the dog will be in an unfamiliar place and could be stressed or scared. Be extra careful to keep it on a leash or in a securely fenced area when it's outdoors to prevent it from becoming lost.</p><h2> Transition the Dog's Food </h2><p>Find out what food your new dog is currently eating and make sure you have enough for the first few weeks. If you plan on changing its food, wait at least a week before introducing the new diet. Then, gradually transition to the new food over a week or so.</p><p>Both stress and diet change can cause stomach upset and diarrhea. Keep an eye out for these or any other signs of illness, many of which may also be brought on by stress.</p><h2> Bond With Your Dog </h2><p>You should spend the first few days bonding with your new dog, but give it some space as well. If it wants to spend time in the crate rather than with you, let it do so. However, you can encourage your dog to interact with you through the use of treats and a soft, calm voice.</p><p>You still need to establish a routine and set down ""house rules."" Begin feeding, walking, and interacting with your dog on the same general schedule each day, If there are areas in or around your home that are off-limits to your dog, establish this upfront. This can be done either by blocking access to the areas or by using the ""leave it"" command.</p><h2> Begin Training Immediately </h2><p>Training should start from the moment your new dog comes home but it's best to start slowly.</p><p>Housetraining is a priority. Many rescue and shelter dogs already have some housetraining, but expect a few accidents over the first few weeks. For other training, work on basic commands and loose-leash-walking at first, then move on to tricks and advanced training. Above all, remember to keep things positive.</p><h2> Schedule a Vet Visit </h2><p>Take your new dog to the veterinarian within a few days after it comes home. It's a good idea to establish a relationship with your vet and open the lines of communication early on. This way, if your new dog becomes ill, your vet will have a better idea of its overall health beforehand.</p><p>The shelter or rescue group should provide you with any vaccine and previous health records. Be sure to bring these to your first vet visit.</p><h2> Let Your Dog Adjust </h2><p>Be aware that your newly adopted dog may behave differently in your home than it did at the shelter or foster home. A long talk with the shelter workers or foster owners can give you an idea of its personality and habits. However, once the dog comes home with you, there's no way to be sure how it will behave.</p><p>It could take weeks or even months for your new dog to show its true personality. Be patient and loving, but also be consistent. Make sure it gets plenty of exercise, mental stimulation, socialization, and attention. All of these things promote a long, healthy, and happy life together.</p><h2> Preventing Problems With Your Dog After Adoption </h2><p>If you have children, try to have them meet the dog before you bring it home so the dog recognizes their scent. At home, introduce the kids to the dog in a calm environment. Keep control by having the dog on a leash and don't leave children alone with the dog unsupervised.</p><p>You'll also want to establish rules with your kids that are appropriate to their age. For instance, young children should be taught not to run after the dog, play with its toys, or pull on its tail or ears. Teaching kids how to properly behave around dogs will go a long way to preventing bites and nips.</p><p>The same precautions should be taken with any pets you already have in the home. Take the time to properly introduce the new dog to resident dogs and cats, giving those pets priority and disrupting their routines as little as possible.</p><p>Do not plan any major trips, renovations, or changes within the first few weeks to months that your dog is living with you. This transition time should be as stress-free as possible, and a trip to the kennel, moving furniture, or workers coming in and out of your home can cause stress to any pet, much less one who's in a new environment.</p>",1019

You don't, however, have to choose between your beloved dog and your ideal home style.</p><p>Tiffany Leigh Piotrowski of Tiffany Leigh Design says that being a dog owner means you need to okay with some level of mess, but that doesn't mean you can't have the pet and the home you love.</p><p>Here are some suggestions for how you can achieve your dream home-and keep your dog comfy and happy.</p><h3> Choose a Subtle Dog Bed and Toys </h3><p>Piotrowski suggests a bed that doesn't stand out too much. Find a pattern, such as stripes, with a neutral tan, light red, or blue design that might not clash with the rest of your decor. You could also go with a plain bed in a color that matches the rest of your decor. If you like to switch up your color palette, it might be best to go with a dark blue, tan, or brown bed that would go with whatever paint colors you have on your walls or the fabric for your couch cushions.</p><p>Designer Shaolin Low of Studio Shaolin says dog owners won't have a hard time finding a chic dog bed option if that's what they're after. Low says she personally prefers an acrylic bed with a simple cushion because they blend in and are easy to clean.</p><p>Piotrowski adds that dog toys that come in neutral colors will match the rest of the house. If you use a subscription box, you could end up with a lot of fun, bright toys for your pup, but those toys could be the ones you want to keep in the closet when friends come over. Neutral toy colors might not stand out quite as much against your personal aesthetic.</p><p>Then again, dogs have their favorite toys. If your pup loves a neon green ball, you don't want to deny him or her an entertaining playtime accessory. Instead of packing toys away to be forgotten, you could use another of Piotrowski's suggestions: Get a toy box that has a lid, so its contents stay hidden but all of your dog's favorite things stay in one place.</p><h3> Be Picky With Your Couch Fabrics </h3><p> stocksy/Trinette Reed</p><p>Not everyone has the ""dogs can't sit on the couch"" rule, and for good reason: It's nice to cozy up to your furry friend while you take in a Netflix binge watch.</p><p>""Definitely stay away from polyester blend sofa as they tend to pill and will pill even faster with dog claws jumping off and on them,"" she says. ""Chenille fabrics are the best for pets for that reason.""</p><p>In addition to picking the right fabric, Low advises that some simple gadgets and actions will help as well: ""A robot vacuum is always a must to pick up the hair that falls on the floor, vacuuming your upholstery once a week with a pet attachment is always a great way to keep your pieces looking fresh and then brushing your dog outside to get all the extra hair off will help reduce shedding in the house.""</p><p>""I always advise clients with dogs to keep a blanket on the sofa that's easy to toss in the wash!,"" she said, adding that a robot-vacuum is also the ticket to a clean, hair-free couch.</p><h3> Have an Area That Belongs Just to Your Dog </h3><p> stocksy/Samantha Gehrmann</p><p>Just like you might keep your kids' toys on a shelf or in a corner of their bedroom, you also likely wouldn't have your dogs' things sitting out around the living room. It's a good idea to keep your dog's toy basket, bed, and any other major accessories in a corner where it won't get in the way of guests or take over the look of the whole room.</p><p>The same goes for dog beds or anything else they use when they sleep. Most people don't have space to give the dog his or her own room, but sectioning off part of the living room or office for a dog bed works well. This way, you can tuck the bed into a space where it doesn't get in the way of anyone's footpath.</p><p>Your dog, as dogs tend to do, might get underfoot, but your dog's squeaky toys shouldn't.</p><p>You also might not want to share your shower or bath with your dog and keep the place where you get clean, well, and free of mud, dog hair, or anything else your pup might bring in from your backyard or the street. If you have the space and budget for it, Piotrowski recommends giving your dog a space for their own shower in the laundry room or mudroom. Her company recently designed the below shower on a project.</p><p>Tiffany Leigh Design</p><p>A shower or bath keeps your dog relatively clean, but there's always the risk of stains. Low added that pet owners can do everything they can to avoid non-dog friendly fabrics or white interiors. At the end of the day, though, dogs are part of your household, and it's not a big problem if visitors see traces of them around the home.</p><p>""I know for me, our dog is like family, she's on all of our upholstery and uses the home just as we do,"" Low said. ""So I embrace the fact that our sofas will always have a little bit of her on them and I'm okay with that too. I select rugs that are pet friendly/easy to clean and call it a day. The joy of having a dog outweighs any inconvenience there is in cleaning up after them.""</p>",962
157,https://www.thesprucepets.com/the-first-24-hours-with-your-new-dog-4689497,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<p> </p><p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>What to Expect in the First 24 Hours With Your New Dog</h1>,"<h1>What to Expect in the First 24 Hours With Your New Dog</h1><p> </p><p>From the cuddles to the cuteness, welcoming a new four-legged family member into your home is certainly an exciting time. However, that isn't to say that those first hours with a new dog (or a new baby for that matter) don't come with their own unique challenges. There's accidents and sleep deprivation and, much like becoming mom and dad to a human baby, many pet parents will wonder if they're ""doing it right."" Here's what to do in those first 24 hours to help ease the transition for both the human and canine members of your family.</p><h2> Let them Settle In </h2><p>Within the first few hours after your dog's arrival, you'll want to make sure that they have everything they'll need to make your house feel like a forever home.</p><p>The last thing you'll want to do is make a run to the nearest pet store when your dog is just getting used to their new environment (and people).</p><p>You'll also want to make an effort to keep those early hours calm and relaxed. Keep visitors to a minimum while your pup has peace and quiet for napping and exploring their new digs. Encourage younger children to lay low for a day or two and give the dog some privacy to prevent the dog from getting overwhelmed, and keep other pets away from your new pup until they're more acclimated.</p><p>Be aware that your new adorable pup could sleep up to 20 hours a day, and as soon as they wake, they'll probably need a bathroom break, so prepare to take off work for a few days.</p><h2> Establish Routines </h2><h3> Potty Training </h3><p>When they're not sleeping (or sniffing), one of the first things you'll want to do is introduce your new family member to their potty area. Whether it's a specific section of grass out front, your fenced-in backyard, or you plan to use an indoor wee-wee pad, potty training should begin within minutes of your pet's arrival. For new puppies, set an alarm to head to the ""potty"" every two hours or so.</p><p>Even if you've adopted an older, previously house-trained dog, it's likely that there are still going to be some accidents as they acclimate to their new surroundings. The sooner you can establish a routine-and get into the practice of heaping lots of praise (and treats!) on your pet for doing their business outside-the faster you'll be on your way to a potty-trained pooch.</p><h3> Setting Simple Boundaries </h3><p>Much like potty training, those first few hours your dog is home is also the prime opportunity to teach your furry friend the house rules. Don't want your puppy chewing on the furniture? You'll have to keep a watchful eye on your mischievous pup to catch them in the act and interrupt the misbehavior. That's the best time to introduce an exciting new toy and offer lots of praise for chewing on a bone instead of your dining room table.</p><h2> Introduce Pet-Friendly Zones </h2><p>After the first few hours, you might find yourself needing to get things done around the house or take a break from the 24-hour supervision that a new dog requires. That's where a crate, gate, or playpen comes in handy. You'll want to take time to introduce your dog to any pet-friendly zones you've prepared for them. Outfit their special areas with a dog bed, blanket, toys, and any other cozy additions to make them feel at home. Since you've already started establishing daily routines, acquainting your pooch to their section of the family room or a guest bedroom is a great thing to do after they're done exploring the house-and if you haven't already, now is a good time to pet-proof any other areas of the home that they seemed to take an interest in, such as closets with your favorite shoes.</p><p>After they've been home for a few hours, get all of the members of the family down on the floor to engage in some quality play-time to begin a positive association. If you'll be feeding your dog in the kitchen, serve them a meal in the place where they will now be dining. If you'll be taking your dog for a leashed walk around the neighborhood or letting them burn off some energy in their new backyard, that they are constantly supervised and prevented from letting their curiosity and excitement put them in danger.</p><h2> Get Some Sleep </h2><p>Plan to hit the hay a little earlier than normal-much like a new baby, a puppy will likely prevent you from sleeping much those first nights. Even an older dog may feel scared or uncertain in their new surroundings (so don't be overly alarmed by whining or crying in the wee hours of the night), and they might need a few potty breaks throughout the night. Many pet owners have their dog's crate set up in their bedroom to provide that physical closeness and reassurance-as well as fast access to the outdoors when needed-and you'll want to be sure to make their crate as comfortable as possible with bedding, a blanket, or even a soft plush toy (assuming the dog can be trusted not to tear it to shreds).</p><p>Whenever possible, you may also want to provide something that reminds a puppy of their mother, such as a blanket or towel that they used before you took them home, or even some of the mother's bedding if you're able to take it home from the breeder.</p><p>No matter what your new dog's age, taking these steps to help them feel at home-while still establishing some boundaries and house rules-can make those first 24 hours with your new four-legged family member feel like a walk in the park.</p>",956
158,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-you-found-a-lost-dog-4707839,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>What to Do If You Found a Lost Dog</h1>,"<h1>What to Do If You Found a Lost Dog</h1><p>If you're an animal lover, it's normal to want to step in to help if you find a lost dog. And you should! Chances are that there is someone out there who is very distraught over their missing pet and who would much appreciate a kind stranger making sure their dog gets home safe. Likewise, if you find a lost dog and it doesn't have a caretaker, you can help ensure that it gets on its way to a forever home.</p><p>Each situation is different, and you'll have to pay careful attention to the dog's body language in order to know how to proceed. Dogs can quickly become wary of strangers when they're lost, and even friendly dogs may react aggressively or run away if you proceed too quickly. As a better alternative, follow the advice below to help make sure that you get the dog help quickly and safely.</p><h2> Approaching a Lost Dog </h2><p>Most lost dogs will bolt if an unknown human approaches them too quickly.</p><p>Take your time, and read the cues you're getting from the dog as best as you can. Ears down and tail between the legs both signify the dog is afraid and that it may run the other way. Speak very softly and calmly, and try to stay low to the ground. Approach from the side instead of head on, and try to avoid making direct or sustained eye contact.</p><p>Be careful not to rush forward at any point or otherwise spook the pup. If they are trying to move away from you, try to guide them in a certain direction, ideally toward a wall or somewhere else where they have less options for getting away. Never guide a dog toward the street if you can help it. Meanwhile, if a dog is curious about you, you may even be able to stay in place and have them come to you instead. Use food to entice them, if you have any.</p><p>A caveat to this is if the dog is showing signs of aggression, such as baring their teeth or growling. If this is the case, keep your eyes on them so you don't lose sight and call animal care and control immediately-they'll be able to send someone out who can safely handle the dog. If the dog runs away, call them anyway to alert them to the sighting so they can take proper action.</p><h2> Home or Shelter? </h2><p>The first step is getting a lost dog safely in your care, whether that means in your arms or in your car. But what do you do from there? The following questions will help you figure out whether you should take the dog to your home or to a shelter. Note that if you choose the former option and have other pets at home, you should bring the dog to a vet first to make sure they have a clean bill of health.</p><h3> Does It Have a Collar? </h3><p>If yes, it's someone's pet. Take it home while you try to get in touch with its owner, or take it directly to its owner's home. If no, there's still a chance the dog is microchipped. Go to a shelter or veterinary office to have the dog scanned.</p><h3> Is It Friendly? </h3><p>If yes, you're probably safe to keep it in your home while you hunt for the owner. If no, trust its care to a shelter, since they'll have more expertise handling difficult dogs.</p><p>If you are at all concerned about bringing a lost dog to your home, don't! Work with the animal welfare resources in your area to find an alternative solution where the dog can be safely housed until it is reunited with its people.</p><h2> Finding the Owner </h2><p>You have a few different avenues that you can use to help find the dog's caregiver, and it's advised that you cover as many bases as you can. Take these steps whether you are able to capture the dog or not.</p><h3> Call Around </h3><p>People who lose dogs will often call local shelters and veterinarians to check whether they have any leads. Call the ones in your area and ask if they've had any lost dog inquiries.</p><h3> Create a Flyer </h3><p>Use a site like FindToto to create a free Found Dog flyer that includes any identifying information and an image of the dog, if you have one. Email the flyer to shelters and vet's offices, and print out a stack you can post around town, too. Focus heavily on the area where you found and/or sighted the dog, since a lost dog will typically stay within a five mile radius.</p><h3> Spread the Word </h3><p>Share the dog's information in as many places as you can, including on social media. Create Found Pet reports on 24PetWatch, PetAmberAlert, PetKey, and more, all of which are sites that caregivers of lost pets frequent to see if there are any updates. Share the flyer you created on their social media pages as well.</p><p>Ideally, you'll hear from the dog's caregiver and be able to facilitate a happy reunion. But what if that doesn't happen? If it's been a few weeks and nobody has contacted you about the dog, you'll need to make a decision about what to do next.</p><p>You have a few options here. You can adopt the pet yourself, or you can work within your own social network to find it new parents or a foster home. You can also relinquish the dog to a local shelter.</p><p>There is a lot of work to be done when you find a lost dog, but it's all worth it. Be patient, and rest easy knowing that no matter what, at least the dog is safe and cared for. </p>",943
159,https://www.thesprucepets.com/compatible-pups-2804605,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>How to Determine Compatibility of a Second Dog</h1>,"<h1>How to Determine Compatibility of a Second Dog</h1><p>It's important to know how to choose a second dog and ensure dog and dog compatibility. How well your current pet(s) accepts a newcomer depends on their age, health, sex, genetics, and traits of instinct, size, personality-the list goes on and on.</p><p>Some dog breeds are more willing to accept other canines (or cats), while others can be downright dangerous. The safety and well being of your new puppy and older dogs must be addressed before you bring the ""new kid"" into your home and introduce to other dogs.</p><h2> Breed Considerations </h2><p>Although there are exceptions, terrier-type breeds developed to go after ""critters"" and other breeds with a high 'prey drive' may not be able to control their instinct to chase and/or attack your new puppy. Sighthounds such as Afghans, Greyhounds, or Scottish Deerhounds may also feel the urge to chase scurrying creatures and may see a small puppy as more of an object to be chased than a companion. Herding dogs chase joggers, bicyclists, sheep, and cats, for instance-it's a natural instinct, so be prepared for careful training if you share your life with one of these go-getters.</p><p>Some dogs who were never properly socialized may have a difficult time adjusting to another dog in the house, especially if they don't know how to communicate with other dogs. However, in general, dogs can adapt, learn to get along, and even enjoy each other's company, with good guidance and positive reinforcement from their human companions.</p><h2> Size Matters </h2><p>Even friendly dogs could prove dangerous if there's a great size disparity between the pets. An 80-pound pooch could accidentally sit on your Chihuahua puppy or hurt the smaller pet if play gets too rough.</p><p>On the other paw, a jumbo-size Great Pyrenees baby might injure your older Lhasa Apso when the puppy-pounces on their fragile frame. Study the breeds and talk with professionals to help you make informed choices. It can work but requires more supervision and care on your part.</p><h2> Cat Considerations </h2><p>Big bruiser felines can be dangerous for tiny pups. Feline predatory behavior prompts games of stalk and pounce that can lead to injuries if interactions with a new puppy are not closely supervised. Claws can injure doggy eyes and/or inspire canine retaliation. Once a cat reaches the age of 12-18 months or so, cats may lose their inclination to make new pet friends. They may show signs of aggression or simply hide and become a stranger in their own home.</p><p>Puppies can be overly eager to play and may not understand the boundaries of what constitutes rough play yet. They also may not know the warning signs for when a cat is not interested in that kind of attention. For this reason, cats may hiss or swat at a new puppy in attempt to communicate these things and in a sense say, ""leave me alone!"" If your resident kitties have had positive experiences with other dogs, they'll be much more likely to eventually accept a new pet into the household. It's very positive if your new puppy grew has also been properly socialized to cats, so they already respect the feline attitude. In all cases, initial introductions should be closely supervised, and it is a good idea to allow each pet to sniff around the areas where the other spends time before having a face-to-face interaction.</p><p>Cats should always be provided with a safe space to escape to during these interactions and should not be punished for growling, hissing, or swatting which are important warning signs that dogs need to learn. Dogs should be kept on leash and/or held to prevent them from chasing or attacking. Positive reinforcement, such as treats and toys should be given to both pets during these interactions when they are calm so they can see that good things happen when they are together.</p><h2> Compatibility </h2><p>Many factors can affect the compatibility of your pets, and ultimately, their individual personalities will be the real deciding factor. Some people suggest that it may be best to choose a new pet that's younger than, and the opposite sex of, your resident pet. That means if you already have a male adult dog, introduce a female pup. This is not always the case, and many times, any combination can work with the right personalities. It may be helpful to consider things like your current dog's activity level, size, and temperament when looking for a compatible housemate.</p><p>If you have more than one dog or cat already, it's not fair to introduce a new pet to all of the cats and dogs in your household at once. Introductions should be done one pet at a time. Sometimes it's love at first sight, but more often, the pets take days or even weeks to learn to accept a newcomer. For this reason, the new pup should be separated from other animals at first to allow for a slow, careful introduction. All initial meetings should be closely supervised and lots of positive reinforcement with treats and toys should be used to show all the pets that this is a good thing. Any time things escalate to where any of the pets are growling, playing too rough, or showing signs of aggression or fear, the interaction should be paused and the pets separated. In this way, it may take many small baby steps to introduce your new pup but your patience will be rewarded with a harmonious home. By planning ahead, you can choose the best puppy for both you-and the resident pets that also share your heart.</p>",924
160,https://www.thesprucepets.com/first-time-dog-owners-tips-1117335,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<p>The Ultimate Guide</p><h1>Tips for First Time Dog Owners</h1>,"<h1>Tips for First Time Dog Owners</h1><h2>What You Should Know if You're New to Dogs</h2><p>Are you a first-time dog owner? Congratulations on finding your new canine companion and welcome to the wonderful world of dog ownership! Here's what you need to know about caring for your new dog.</p><h2>Know What to Expect After Your New Dog Comes Home</h2><p>Whether your new dog is a puppy or an adult, there will be some kind of adjustment period after your new dog comes home. Prepare in advance and be patient. Dogs are often scared or overwhelmed when they go to a new home for the first time. They may hide or show signs of fear. Others may appear aloof and relaxed until they get used to life, then they even may become hyperactive once they feel confident. Some will be right at home within a day or two, while others take several months to adjust.</p><p>Adult dogs often need more adjustment time, especially if they lived in a shelter for a while. On the other hand, puppies usually need more training (especially house training). Either way, it's usually several months before you and your new dog settle into a routine.</p><p>Have everything set up at home and make a plan for everything your new dog comes home. This will help you get off to a great start.</p><h2>Got a Puppy? Learn All About Puppies</h2><p>Puppies are amazing, but nobody said they were easy! There's a lot to learn about raising puppies the right way. Socialization, training, and vaccinations are just of few of the thing you will need to read up on and add to your to-do list.</p><p>Caring for a puppy can sometimes feel like a full-time job, especially if the puppy is very young. Start the research before your puppy comes home so you'll be ready for anything.</p><h2>Meet Your Dog's Basic Needs</h2><p>Now that you're a proud dog owner, you must master the basics of dog care. At the very least, every dog needs proper nutrition, adequate shelter, physical care, and social interaction. Once you can cover the basics, you'll be on your way to giving your dog an amazing life. Learning how to provide for your dog in advance will make it much easier once your new dog comes home.</p><h2>Find a Great Veterinarian</h2><p>Every dog needs a great vet! One of the first places you take your new dog is to see the vet. Your veterinarian will look out for your dog's health, educate you about your dog, and guide you through the world of dog ownership. Find a veterinarian you love with a great staff and team. Most of all, always keep the lines of communication open between you and your vet.</p><h2>Stock Up on Dog Supplies</h2><p>Your dog is going to need all kinds of stuff in his new home. How do you decide what your dog actually and what you ? Perhaps you get a bit of both. Carefully navigate your way through the world of dog toys, bowls, beds, leashes, collars, crates, and much more. There are some great pet supply websites out there where you can shop for your pooch. Plus, your town or city is bound to have some great pet supply shops.</p><h2>Choose the Right Dog Food</h2><p>Your dog's diet is the foundation of his health. But with so many dog foods to consider, you may find yourself getting overwhelmed. Learn about the basics of canine nutrition, then choose a diet that fits your dog's needs. There's no one right answer when it comes to dog food. One rule of thumb is this: if your dog is doing well on a certain type of dog food, then it's probably just fine (as long as it is complete and balanced). </p><h2>Dog Training is Essential</h2><p>Every dog needs training. Dog training helps you control your dog and gives your dog a sense of structure. In the long run, proper training can make both you and your dog happier. Plus, it will enhance the special bond you two share. Take a little time each day to train your dog, working through all the essential steps of dog training, including basic commands.</p><h2>Prepare for Behavior Problems</h2><p>No dog is perfect. Most dog owners will have to deal with some kind of behavior issue at some point. It may be something as simple as excessive barking or destructive chewing. On the other hand, you may encounter a more serious issue like separation anxiety or aggression. You might even see that your new dog is urinating inappropriately (which may be a health issue and not a behavioral one). Either way, it's always a good idea to be well-informed about canine behavior problems they become issues for you and your dog.</p><h2>Also Get Ready for Health Problems</h2><p>At least a few health problems are bound to come up in your dog's lifetime. If you're lucky, you'll only see some of the common health issues that are a bit easier to deal with. Hopefully, your dog will not encounter any serious health problems or, worse, medical emergencies. Take the necessary steps to keep your dog healthy and many health issues may be avoidable.</p><h2> Be a Responsible Dog Owner </h2><p>This is one of the most important things you need to know as a new dog owner. Being a responsible dog owner is about committing to your dog for life and accepting responsibility for your dog's actions. It means taking proper care of your own dog while respecting your community. If you can do this, then you are surely on the right track.</p>",910
161,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-a-puppy-mill-1117271,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>Defining Puppy Mills and the Truth About Them</h1>,"<h1>Defining Puppy Mills and the Truth About Them</h1><p>We often hear about the negative aspects of puppy mills in the media, through animal welfare and advocacy groups, and from fellow dog lovers. What actually defines a puppy mill? Why are puppy mills a problem? What can we do about them? There are several differences between these mills and responsible breeders to take into consideration before choosing where to adopt a dog.</p><h2> What Is a Puppy Mill? </h2><p>The term ""puppy mill"" is used to describe a large-scale commercial dog breeding enterprise. Sometimes called puppy farms, these operations tend to house their dogs and puppies in squalid conditions. Puppy mills overlook healthy breeding traits and safe practices to instead focus on profits. Puppy mills do not actually refer to their businesses as such; they usually call themselves dog breeders or kennels.</p><p>Puppy mill proprietors mass-produce puppies by over-breeding dogs, often regardless of health or genetic defects. The breeding dogs spend their lives being bred repeatedly until no longer deemed useful. The animals are kept in cramped, unsanitary conditions (usually very small wire cages) with little or no chance to play, exercise, or become socialized with humans and other dogs. By six to eight weeks of age, most puppies will be sold to pet stores or marketed directly online. Sadly, a large percentage of puppy mill dogs will develop health and/or behavioral issues. Many are eventually abandoned or euthanized because of these problems.</p><h2> Puppy Mills Versus Responsible Dog Breeders </h2><p>On the surface, it may be difficult to discern between a puppy mill and a responsible breeder. Go beyond the surface, though, and the difference is quite obvious.</p><p>Puppy mills are commercial dog breeders that prioritize profits over the health and well-being of their animals, often keeping them in unsanitary conditions and overlooking poor medical history of parent dogs. It's heartbreaking. Good breeders work together with veterinarians to consider inherited veterinary issues, temperament, and ideal traits before breeding a specific dog.</p><p>Responsible breeders put the well-being of their dogs first and strive to improve their breed. They work closely with veterinarians and other pet professionals to ensure the health and safety of their dogs. Responsible dog breeders have their dogs screened for specific health problems (e.g., orthopedic, heart, eyes) and are up-front and honest about the puppies' medical histories and genetic lines. Dogs with health issues or behavior problems are not bred, especially if their issues are potentially hereditary. Instead, they are spayed or neutered and placed in good homes.</p><p>Responsible breeders are affiliated with their local and national breed clubs and should be able to provide plenty of excellent references. They tend to operate on a smaller scale than puppy mills. In many cases, they make little to no profit. Puppies coming from these breeders are usually raised in home-like environments and are socialized from birth. The dogs used for breeding often spend their lives as family pets.</p><p>Finally, any responsible dog breeder is willing and eager to take back a puppy or dog from its new owner if a hereditary issue appears or if, for some reason, that owner can no longer keep the dog. In the case of puppies that come from puppy mills, it may be impossible to trace back the origin of that puppy.</p><h2> How Puppy Mills Stay in Business </h2><p>The simplest reason why puppy mills still operate comes down to supply and demand. Certain dog breeds or hybrid dogs (Goldendoodles, Shorkies, etc.) are extremely popular, sometimes to the extent that there are waiting lists for the puppies. Uninformed prospective dog owners may be lured by adorable photos and attractive websites set up by puppy mills. Finding that there are puppies available for purchase, people might jump at the chance to get one of their own. In some cases, people are not willing or able to pay top dollar for the dogs they want, so they find a lower price and don't realize it's a red flag. Puppy mills may sell their dogs for slightly less than their quality counterparts in order to attract buyers.</p><p>Unfortunately, after looking for a ""better price"" or a more readily available puppy, many people unknowingly buy dogs from puppy mills. Sometimes it is because they were fooled by cute pictures on a flashy website or a very convincing argument from the pet store. The old saying ""if it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is"" really applies here. Play it safe and get your dog the responsible way: through an experienced and reputable dog breeder. Also, remember that there are plenty of purebred dogs and cute mixes in shelters and rescue groups.</p><h2> How to Avoid Supporting Puppy Mills </h2><p>It's common to hear people ask this question: ""By purchasing from a puppy mill or pet store, wouldn't I just be rescuing that poor puppy from a horrible life?"" The answer is a firm no. This is a very common idea that might seem logical at first, but actually causes harmful effects long-term. Purchasing a puppy mill dog is only helping to keep puppy mills in business.</p><p>If you come across this type of breeder, the best step is to file a report with authorities so an investigation can be conducted. Allow the dogs to be taken in by animal care professionals and have full veterinary evaluations. If and when they are put up for adoption, you can even adopt one of the puppies. This way, the animals get the care they need and the homes they deserve, while any unethical breeders are handled accordingly to prevent future neglect or poor breeding techniques.</p>",921

Part of deciding to add a dog to your family is choosing the right dog. A big part of this is making the choice between a puppy or an older dog. Each stage of a dog's life has numerous advantages to the other stages, so it really boils down to what matters to you most. Here are the pros and cons of adopting dogs of different adult ages.</p><h2> The Settled Senior Dog </h2><p>Officially seniors by seven years of age, most dogs don't earn the ""settled senior"" title until they are nine years or older, especially smaller dogs that mature slower than larger breeds.</p><p>Most senior have already been house trained, evaluated for their compatibility with other animals and children, and have had additional basic training.</p><p>It's hard to watch a pet you love age and die. However, this relationship can be truly rewarding. Even knowing that heartache could be right around the corner, most owners would do it again and again because the joy is just so much more. Plus, a nine-year-old dog may still have another four years left to live. Why not help make those years as comfortable and content as possible by giving him a lovely retirement home?</p><p>Senior dogs can be wonderful, sweet-tempered animals that don't get quite as excited, or quite as anxious as young dogs. They are happy to either walk a sedate mile with you or lounge on the sofa beside you.</p><p>A senior dog may have age-related issues that could be either time-consuming (sight or hearing loss) or expensive.</p><p>Undesirable behaviors that have been picked throughout the dog's life may be harder to train him out of. You can teach an old dog new tricks, but undoing behavior is harder.</p><p>The biggest reason that senior dogs are hard to adopt out? It's the mentality of ""why would I give my heart to a dog who is only going to die in a year or two?"" Dogs wiggle into your heart rather quickly, and adopting a dog that is 10 years old could mean that your relationship is of short duration.</p><h2> The Mature Adult </h2><p>From three to six years of age, a dog has really come into himself. He knows what feels good, what tastes good, and where to get what he wants. Adult dogs know how to settle into the good life with little fuss.</p><p>Adult dogs in shelters and rescues are usually mostly house trained, if not completely. Many have had basic training (sit, stay, come, etc.).</p><p>Most adoptable dogs have been evaluated by shelter volunteers for compatibility towards other animals and kids.</p><p>A full-grown adult dog can still be puppy-like in his desire to play and run with you. Dogs of all ages love to play and a full-grown dog has fewer physical limitations on what kind of physical activity he can do.</p><p>Most adopted adult dogs seem to know they have found a good life and are reluctant to leave it.</p><p>It's harder to un-train a dog of certain unwanted habits, like counter-surfing, garbage-eating, etc. Luckily, it can be done, it just takes persistence and consistency.</p><p>Adult dogs have an unknown quality to them. Something completely innocuous could turn them into fear-biters or undo weeks of socialization.</p><p>The fear that an adult dog won't bond properly with his new owners is a big one. Some breeds are notorious for being ""one-man"" dogs, and this puts off a lot of potential adopters.</p><h2> The Adolescent Age </h2><p>From one to three years of age is, in my experience, the most frustrating period for dog owners. Like teenagers, they push their boundaries and try to get away with all sorts of mischief. This is, unsurprisingly, the age that is most often surrendered to shelters by owners that can't take it anymore. Consistency and supervision are the most important things for this stage, even if it means going right back to basic puppy training.</p><p>Dogs over a year old have made connections between behavior and reward, even if that reward is slightly delayed.</p><p>The age-related restrictions on physical exercise have started to lift, allowing to do more strenuous play with your dog, like longer hikes, jogging, jumping games and starting dog sports if you are so inclined.</p><p>There might be behaviors that you need to deal with, like counter-surfing, biting, and inappropriate marking.</p><p>As was mentioned earlier, adolescent dogs will push their boundaries and constantly try to get away with things. It takes a stern leader to get through the adolescent stage, but once you do, the rest is pretty much smooth sailing.</p><h2> The Small Puppy Stage </h2><p>Nobody can resist a puppy; that sweet puppy smell, that adorable face, and the insatiable curiosity. All cuteness aside, puppies are a lot of work and every pleasure of a puppy has its match in unpleasantness.</p><p>Starting with a puppy is starting with a blank slate. While genetics do play a role in how your matures and what type of personality he develops, most of his adult life will be shaped by you, his owner, trainer and ""parent.""</p><p>Puppies are adorable and cuddly!</p><p>Puppies take a great deal of time. You really don't want to get a puppy when you aren't home a lot of the time. Your puppy will be missing out on valuable training and socialization if he is he left alone for long periods. </p><p>You will need to invest a little more money at first on your puppy's vet care for things like puppy vaccines and spay or neuter.</p>",916

At one point, Overdeep even had to learn sign language for one of her deaf foster pets.</p><p>""Your heart gets stronger. These dogs would be stuck without people willing to take them on,"" she said.</p><p>BBAR would often name the mom dog first and name her puppies to match.</p><p>Once, she said, there was a dog anointed with the name Beyoncé, and BBAR named all the puppies after Beyoncé songs (there's a pooch out there who was once called ""Irreplaceable!"").</p><p>Another mom was named Chrissy Teigen, and the puppies were recipes in her cookbook, ""Cravings,"" Overdeep said.</p><p>When the musical ""Hamilton"" was big on Broadway, they named the dogs after the stars in the original cast. The shelter tagged the celebrities in their Instagram stories so they could meet their canine counterpart.</p><p>The dogs without puppies also get silly names after they come to BBAR from high kill shelters, said Overdeep. For example, she fondly remembers Tree Trunks and Green Bean.</p><h2> Tacoma Humane Society (Tacoma, WA) </h2><p> Bryanna Shaw has been an employee of and volunteer at the Humane Society for Tacoma &amp; Pierce County for about six years. She has a passion for helping animals who are in transition and need interim care.</p><p>Shaw said she and her fellow shelter workers rely on a very handy guide when naming the pups: a baby-naming book!</p><p> ""If we can't think of one we use a baby name book and just open it to a random name,"" she said. ""Staff and volunteers love picking random names for the animals; most of the time we get to know the pet and pick what matches.""</p><p>The names tend to match the animal's personalities. One feisty cat was named Charlie Chaplin, for example. Foster parents, who care for some of the litters before they are adopted, usually name them.</p><p> Shaw has also seen avant garde names such as Lambchop or Bubba and even a snake named Nagini after the ""Harry Potter"" character. Because it's up to the foster parent, the names can get stranger and stranger.</p><h2> Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue (Denver, CO) </h2><p>For Claudia Guthrie, volunteering at a cat shelter is the purrrfect way to relax outside of her day job and care for the many felines she loves so dearly.</p><p>Guthrie has always been very into all sorts of cats, and says she is involved with the shelter of Rocky Mountain Feline Rescue to help these cuties find their forever homes. </p><p>Claudia Guthrie</p><p>Many of the adoptees-in-waiting are often transported from shelters in Texas, which influences their names.</p><p>""They have two parts to their name: The first is what the Texas shelter named them, the second is the location of the shelter,"" she said. For instance, a couple of these names were Tuck Pampa and Ramona Houston.</p><p>As there are so many cats from different parts of Texas-from Houston to Dallas, she feels all cats in the business of being adopted deserve to have fabulous, interesting names with ties to where their roots came from.</p><p>It's part of Guthrie's passion as a cat shelter volunteer to make sure other people's animals/future animals are thoughtful responders. </p><h2> Wayside Waifs (Kansas City, MO) </h2><p>Like Shaw, volunteer Mary Kate William often also uses themes that differentiate litters of puppies and kittens at Wayside Waifs.""When it comes to litters of puppies or kittens, there's usually a theme so we can tell which litter they're in,"" she said. ""For example, I once got to name a litter of puppies after different penguin species: like Gentoo, Emperor, Macaroni, and more! </p><p>Mary Kate Williams</p><p>It's the best way to keep things organized, especially this time of year when we have tons of puppies and kittens in foster.""Williams loves to give the animals lots of love and help them find their forever home-or at least their possible forever name.You can always rename a pet once you adopt it, but Williams thinks the names her shelter chooses are special. For the many strays transferred from smaller, rural shelters that are random intakes, the shelter comes up with names at the volunteers' discretion.On occasion, the names derive from happy accidents. Williams was once supposed to type out the name ""Bingo"" for one dog she was searching up the info for, but ended up making the typo ""Bungo."" That name quickly became part of the lexicon.</p><p>Mary Kate Williams</p><p>""I thought that word was hilarious, so I suggested it as a name to my friend in admissions,"" she said. ""The name was assigned to the next stray dog that came in, and Bungo the chihuahua is forever my legacy.""</p><p>So, does Williams have any other names up her sleeve in the meantime?</p><p>""I've been trying to get an animal to be named Mothman for a while now, but that keeps getting shot down,"" she said.</p>",901
164,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dont-dump-your-dog-1117268,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>Giving Away Your Dog? Reasons and Solutions</h1>,"<h1>Giving Away Your Dog? Reasons and Solutions</h1><h2>Steps To Take If You're Unable to Keep Your Pet</h2><p>It's a big responsibility to have a dog, but sometimes life gets in the way and you might have to make serious choices such as giving up a beloved pet. There are many ways to avoid this, but if you've exhausted all of your options, please know you are not alone. Consider contacting animal rescue groups, many of which will accept dogs under certain circumstances. If you cannot find a new home, foster arrangement, or rescue group, your last resort may be giving away a dog to a shelter or surrendering your pet to animal control. But be aware that many dogs never get adopted from these shelters and can end up being put to death. In addition, never abandon a dog; it's illegal to do so in most areas under animal cruelty laws.</p><h3>Fast Fact</h3><p>Nearly 400,000 dogs in the United States are euthanized each year because of overcrowding in shelters, so try not to contribute to that number.</p><p>Here is a list of situations you may be experiencing and alternative options to consider before deciding to give your dog away.</p><h2> I'm Moving and My New Place Does Not Allow Dogs </h2><p>With diligence, it's possible to find a pet-friendly residence. Though renting an apartment with a dog is not always easy, try to negotiate the conditions with potential landlords and be willing to spend a little extra money. If you absolutely must move right away and cannot find a place that allows your dog, talk to friends and family who may be willing to take care of your dog for an extended period while you search for other arrangements.</p><h3>Watch Now: 9 Simple Ways to Love Your Pet</h3><h2> I Am Having a Baby </h2><p>Congratulations on your happy news! However, you don't need to give up your dog because of the new baby. Growing up with a dog is a wonderful experience for children. In fact, evidence suggests that early exposure to dogs can prevent the development of allergies in children.</p><p>Dogs and kids can be a great combination if handled correctly. It is essential that your dog is properly trained and exposed to babies and small children before your baby is born. Then, be certain to introduce the baby to the dog appropriately. Plus, it's important that you raise your children to respect dogs.</p><p>Make sure you include your dog in as many family events, outings, and gatherings as possible. If your dog knows its place in the family, you can have a safer, more peaceful family unit. Your dog and your kids must understand how to act appropriately around one another. If done right, growing up with a dog is one of the best gifts you can give to your child.</p><h2> My Dog Has Health or Behavioral Issues That Are out of Control </h2><p>Health problems and behavior issues with pets are frustrating but it is never fair to give away a suffering dog unless you have tried everything in your power to alleviate the situation.</p><p>Certain issues can be resolved, so, for example, you may not need to consider giving away a dog with separation anxiety. Some health or behavior issues can't be resolved. In some severe cases, professionals may advise you that the most humane thing you can do is euthanasia as a last resort.</p><h2> I Cannot Afford My Dog Anymore </h2><p>Financial struggles can happen to anyone, and understandably affording your dog can become very difficult. Before deciding to give the dog away, learn more about the cost of dog ownership, then make a budget that includes your pet's necessary expenses. You may find that you can afford your dog after all, especially if you make wise choices to save money on dog care expenses.</p><p>To lower long-term expenses, do everything you can to keep your dog healthy. A nutritious diet, regular exercise, and preventive veterinary care all play major roles in keeping future costs down.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you have a large veterinarian bill, don't give up! There are organizations that may be able to help you afford necessary care for your pet. For example, if you are facing cancer care for your dog, you may be able to find help to reduce treatment costs by contacting various organizations like the Pet Fund ready to help.</p><h2> I Have an Illness or Other Physical Limitation and Can No Longer Care for My Dog </h2><p>It's understandable why you might feel the need to give up your dog in this situation, but there may be other options. Your dog will most likely be a comfort to you during your illness, so it will be beneficial to keep it around. Even if you need to enter a nursing home, there may be a way to keep your dog around.</p><p>Animal Legal Defense Fund.</p><p>. American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>",860
165,https://www.thesprucepets.com/buyer-beware-bad-dog-breeders-2804629,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>Beware of Bad Dog Breeders</h1>,"<h1>Beware of Bad Dog Breeders</h1><h2>Questions to Ask Before Buying a New Puppy</h2><p>Once you've researched and chosen your puppy breed, it's time to research questions to ask dog breeders and be alert for warning signs when you encounter an unethical breeder. Puppies easily wiggle their way into our hearts but it's important to know what you should expect from your dog breeder.</p><h2> Consider Pedigrees and Registration </h2><p>It may not be important to you to have a registered puppy if you don't plan to breed or compete in conformation dog shows. But legitimate and responsible breeders have pedigree information and registration documents available. If you've paid for a pedigreed dog, you should receive the proper documentation.</p><p>Be sure to ask if your chosen puppy is a show prospect or considered ""pet quality."" The breeder may retain showing or breeding rights or only offer co-ownership if the puppy has a good chance for excelling in competition. The breeder may offer only a limited registration or withhold papers altogether until a ""pet quality"" puppy has been spayed or neutered. Pet quality puppies usually cost less but are equally wonderful pets.</p><h2> Ask About Health History and Guarantees </h2><p>Even well-bred and cared for puppies may develop health problems. For instance, hip dysplasia may not become apparent until the puppy is a couple of years old. Ask if the purchase price includes any sort of health guarantee, and what health clearances have been done on the puppies and the parents.</p><p>For instance, breeders of dog breeds known to have problems with hip dysplasia should have the parents screened with OFA or Pennhip radiographs, the test for hip dysplasia based on studying X-rays of the dog's hips. Since this is a heritable condition, responsible breeders should not breed any dog that has evidence of hip dysplasia, which could increase the risk that puppies might have the condition. Make sure you educate yourself on common inherited conditions in the breed you are seeking so you can ask about the appropriate screenings. Even with screening tests, there is not a guarantee your puppy will be healthy but improves the chances he won't inherit certain breed-related problems. Some breeders offer refunds or rebates of purchase cost should the puppy develop heritable conditions later in life.</p><p>Your breeder should also provide medical history on the puppy. Depending on the age of adoption, this will include some puppy shots and other routine care like deworming. The purchase contract may require owners to maintain specific health care practices, feed recommended diets or other specific instructions.</p><h2> Check Out the Facilities </h2><p>Before being smitten with puppy-love, get an up close and personal look at where the baby was born and raised. Visit the breeder. If the breeder refuses, that should raise your antennae. Breeders have valid reasons for declining visits-puppies may be too young, for instance-but they should be able to explain to your satisfaction.</p><p>The facilities should be clean. There should be adequate food and water. Look for warm comfortable sleeping areas free of feces or urine. Look for a modest number of dogs, and go elsewhere if the yard or house is filthy and they've got dozens of dogs with multiple litters. Puppies can be hard to keep clean, especially with large litters, but you can tell if cleanliness is neglected or is a priority. If the pups and mom-dog are kenneled, ask how much people interaction is provided. That's vital for proper puppy socialization.</p><h2> Check Out Mom </h2><p>Ask to see the parents, if possible. Stud dogs often are owned by someone else, but the mother dog should be on the premises. Some mothers are quite protective of puppies, so it may be best to meet her away from the litter. Checking out mom can be a window into your puppy's future and lets you see how her puppy may develop once grown. If the mother dog acts fearful, growls, or must be locked away, it may be a red flag as to her own lack of socialization and temperament. Also look mom over for a sense of her health. Is she very thin? Does she have a healthy-looking coat? Any signs of an unkempt or unwell mother dog can tell you a lot about the care she and her puppies receive, and give you a sense of what the breeder prioritizes. A breeder who provides good care for the mother dog is taking responsibility for her health and wellbeing and not just using her to churn out puppies for a profit.</p><h2> Expect a Quiz </h2><p>The best breeders want puppies to go to a forever home that provides proper care and training. So expect to be quizzed on what you expect and can offer to their treasured baby. If there are no questions from the breeder, run the other way.</p><p>Ask if the breeder has ever turned down a sale. You want the answer to be YES, rather than learning they'll let a puppy go to just anyone who asks.</p><p>A healthy puppy from a reputable breeder with a good bloodline won't be cheap and can run several hundreds or thousands of dollars. Local newspapers may post advertisements for much less. Backyard breeders and puppy mill establishments may offer ""purebred"" puppies dirt cheap, but they won't pass any of these test questions. You'll get what you pay for.</p>",878
166,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-adopt-a-failed-service-dog-4584287,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>How to Adopt a Failed Service Dog</h1>,"<h1>How to Adopt a Failed Service Dog</h1><p>All dogs are good dogs, but not all dogs are good service dogs. Some service dogs-in-training fail to make it through the process-usually because they're just not fit for the different roles a service dog has to play. This is great news for the rest of us because those who ""fail"" service dog training almost always go up for adoption.</p><p>Adopting a failed service dog is just one other way that you can go about providing a home for an animal in need. Many organizations source their dogs from rescue groups, and adopting them out directly is a way to keep them from going back into the shelter system. You may have a few more hoops to jump through than going the traditional shelter route (and you'll probably have to wait a while), but if it's something you're interested in, it's definitely worth looking into. Here's what to know before starting this process.</p><h2> Why Dogs Fail Service Dog Training </h2><p>Being a service dog is a big job, and not all pups are cut out for it. The reasons are either health-related or behavior-related. Health-wise, dogs may suffer from eye issues like cataracts, joint problems, or have food or other allergies that make it difficult for them to be on top of their game at all times. Behaviorally, things like too much energy, too much friendliness with strangers, or difficulties on leash can disqualify a dog from service training.</p><p>On the bright side, a dog who is unqualified for service may be the perfect pup for someone who's simply looking for a pet. Remember that service dogs are working dogs whose handlers rely on them to perform very important tasks, from guiding them through public spaces to sniffing out bombs in airports. Pets, on the other hand, have a lot less responsibility. Things like allergies or too much energy don't discount their ability to love and be loved, which is essentially the job of our animal companions.</p><h2> How to Adopt a Failed Service Dog </h2><p>There are many national dog organizations that adopt out canines who fail to make it through training. You'll often see these dogs referred to as ""career change dogs,"" since they're simply changing careers from service animal to pet.</p><p>Some of the most popular service dog organizations with adoption programs include Service Dogs Inc., Freedom Service Dogs of America, Guide Dogs for the Blind, and Guide Dogs of America, though there are plenty more.</p><p>Prices to adopt a career change dog range from $0 to $1,000+. The high prices can be attributed to high demand, as well as the professional training that the dogs receive up until the point of adoption. Speaking of high demand, these organizations often have way more potential adopters than dogs ready to be re-homed. You may have to wait months-or even years-for a dog to become available, which is a very long time if you're ready to add a new animal companion to your family.</p><p>To find adoption requirements, visit the websites of service dog organizations you are interested in. There you'll see details about what they require and whether any dogs are currently available. You'll also find links to fill out adoption applications. Be sure to read all of the provided details before applying, and to become familiar with the adoption process and the associated fee.</p><p>If you have any questions, just call the organization directly. They'll almost always be glad to answer any lingering inquiries that you have or give you more information on their individual adoption procedures.</p><h2> Is Adopting a Failed Service Dog Right for You? </h2><p>When it comes to getting a new pet, adoption is always the right way to go. As to whether you should adopt a dog right from the shelter or get a career change dog from a service organization, it's up to you-both are great ways to make a difference.</p><p>It will take a while. Don't expect to bring a failed service dog home anytime soon. You'll very likely have to hop on a waiting list, and it could take years before you're next in line.</p><p>It's not always cheap. Service dog organizations invest a lot into their trainees, and the fees they charge for adoptions help them recuperate those costs. You may have to spend upwards of $1,000 for a career change dog, versus a couple hundred dollars for a dog from a shelter.</p><p>You may be limited on breeds. Dogs who are most likely to be found in service dog organizations tend to be Labs, Golden Retrievers, German shepherds, Poodles, or mixes of these breeds. If you've got your heart set on a Bulldog or a Shih Tzu, you'd probably have better luck with a breed-specific rescue group.</p><p>As always, be sure to properly prepare for a new dog before adopting. Whether your new pup comes from a rescue group or a service dog organization, you should always stock up on what you need before they walk in the door, and be ready to take on the task of training and building your bond. </p><p>Failed service dogs have a ton to offer the right adopters. If you'd like to add one to your family, start doing your research and filling out applications.</p>",864
167,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-adopt-retired-police-dogs-4584724,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>Adopting Retired Police Dogs</h1>,"<h1>Adopting Retired Police Dogs</h1><p>When police dogs retire, they can be adopted by their handlers or other service members. If that's not an option, they can be adopted out into the general public. Adopting a retired police dog is a good way to give back to an animal that worked to keep your neighborhood or city safe. Though there is no one specific organization dedicated to finding policing dogs homes, there are organizations that work to help former working dogs, including putting them in good homes.</p><h2> What Is a Police Dog </h2><p>Many police departments around the country employ special K-9 units that assist officers in everything from finding missing people to searching for evidence at crime scenes. These heavily trained dogs are true partners to their human companions, working tirelessly alongside them to keep their handlers-and the rest of us-safe.</p><h3>Fast Fact</h3><p>Up until the year 2000, most retired police dogs were euthanized, a shocking practice that was thankfully stopped when Robby's Law was signed by then-President Bill Clinton. Under the new law, which still stands today, dogs retiring from service in law enforcement or the military can be adopted by their handlers or other service members or the general public.</p><h2> What to Know About Retired Police Dogs </h2><p>Most of the time, police dogs retire because of age. These dogs are highly intelligent and work hard throughout their lives, first in training and then in active service. By age 7 or 8 (or sometimes up to 10 or 11), they're ready to hang up their K-9 badges and spend their remaining years relaxing.</p><p>While police dogs are incredibly well-trained, the stress of the job can have unintended consequences, including anxiety and depression. Dogs who retire from the police force may exhibit negative behaviors such as aggression, separation anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder. As such, they may require additional training in retirement or even re-socialization.</p><p>This isn't to say that adopting a retired police dog isn't worth it. In many cases, adopting a retired police K-9 is an incredible opportunity to provide a chance for a working dog to be just, well, a dog. If you're interested in pursuing this type of rescue, read on for the steps that you'll need to take.</p><h2> How to Apply for a Retired Police Dog </h2><p>Police dogs form intensely strong bonds with their handlers in the line of duty. As such, their handlers are always the first choice for adopters when the dogs retire. In most cases, these dogs do go on to live carefree lives as family pets with their police partners.</p><p>Usually, opportunities for civilians to adopt retired police dogs only occur if a dog's handler passes away or cannot otherwise care for him or her. Sometimes, dogs who ""failed"" out of police dog training and never actually performed active service become adoptable. In both cases, other law enforcement officers will be first in line to adopt, followed by the general public.</p><p>There is no organization strictly dedicated to adopting retired police dogs. Instead, organizations like the National Police Dog Foundation and the Retired Police Canine Foundation assist handlers with things like medical care and training for their retired pups.</p><p>Mission K9, however, is an organization that assists former working dogs in many ways, including arranging civilian adoptions. To find out more about their adoption procedure, as well as the process for adopting a retired police dog, visit their ""Adopt"" page.</p><p>Your best bet for adopting a retired police dog is to do the legwork yourself, calling local police stations and K-9 officer training facilities and inquiring directly. If a police department or training organization does have a dog for adoption or expects that they will soon-either because the dog is retiring from the force or deemed unfit for service-they'll be able to fill you in on the exact adoption process and any adopter requirements. Do note that waiting lists can take time, and it may be years before a dog is available for you.</p><h2> Why You Should Consider Adopting a Former Police Dog </h2><p>The process to adopt a retired or ""failed"" police dog isn't an easy one, nor is there a guarantee that a dog will be available or you'll be successful in your application. If all the moving parts do come together, adopting a dog whose service has ended is a truly impactful way to give a happy ending to dogs who have worked hard to protect and serve the people around them.</p><p>The life of a police dog isn't always easy. Like their handlers, police K-9s frequently face high-stress situations and life-threatening dangers. Adopting a retired police dog is an opportunity to provide a canine a chance to just be a pet in their final years, with all of the love and spoiling that goes along with it.</p><p>Rescuing a pet is a fantastic way to make a difference. If a retired police dog isn't available, look through the TSA Dog Adoption Program, or consider just heading to your local shelter. There are millions of dogs and cats in need of homes, and many would be delighted to find forever with you. </p>",841

How can you tell the difference between a responsible dog breeder and an irresponsible one (often known as a backyard breeder)?</p><p>Unfortunately, not all dog breeders are ethical and responsible. Some are more concerned with profits than the welfare of their animals. Others believe they are doing the right thing, but simply lack the knowledge and experience to be good breeders.</p><h3>What Is a Backyard Breeder?</h3><p>The term ""backyard breeder"" is sometimes used to describe dog breeders with little experience or knowledge, substandard conditions of care, and a lack of selective breeding. Backyard breeders typically breed dogs without taking the time to make good genetic matches or have dogs registered with the appropriate kennel club or breed club.</p><h2> Why Some Dog Breeders Should Be Avoided </h2><p>Some breeders are just looking to make a profit off of the so-called purebred dogs that they own. They may let dogs reproduce freely without knowledge of their family histories (health and behavioral, in particular). They pay little or no attention to genetic health issues in both the parents and the puppies. They often charge less money for the puppies than a responsible breeder, but still more money than they should (no one should pay for puppies that were bred carelessly). These dogs may seem less expensive, but in the long run, you may end up paying more for these dogs when health issues develop. In many cases, these breeders will not take their puppies back if something goes wrong. Never trust a breeder who won't guarantee the puppies.</p><p>There are other cases where someone has dogs that were accidentally bred and a litter of puppies was the result, or a family decided to breed its dogs ""just one time"" or ""just for fun."" These methods are not recommended, as the result could be unhealthy and/or unwanted puppies. These people are not usually aware of the fact that their actions are unethical. However, if they try to charge money for the puppies, it is unethical behavior.</p><p>Be aware that even if you get a free puppy from this situation, you could end up with an unhealthy dog down the road. If this occurs, it is best to ask the dog owners to spay and neuter their dogs (they need to stop breeding the dogs). If you don't mind getting a puppy with an unknown genetic history, go to your local shelter or rescue group. You can find a cute puppy that had already been checked over by a veterinarian.</p><h2> How to Avoid Bad Dog Breeders </h2><p>If you are determined to get a purebred puppy, then you will probably want to start looking for a dog breeder. If ""papers"" (registration) or parentage are not important to you, then you should consider adoption instead. Seek out a breed-specific rescue group or even your local animal shelter. If you care about dogs, one of the worst things you can do is purchase a dog from a bad breeder. Perhaps the only thing worse is purchasing a puppy from a pet store; supporting a business that puts profit over the welfare of its animals is not something a true dog lover would ever do.</p><p>When you find a dog breeder, it is essential that you check references. Talk to other families that have purchased dogs from that breeder. Check that the breeder is affiliated with the local and national breed clubs and a national kennel club (such as the AKC). Most importantly, make sure you visit the breeding facility and meet the puppies' parents (mother at least).</p><h2> Questions to Ask The Dog Breeder </h2><p>You should be able to ask the dog breeder a multitude of questions without issue. A responsible breeder will appreciate that you care enough to do research. You will likely have plenty of your own questions to ask, but here are some ideas to ensure you are working with a breeder who cares about the animals first.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>A good breeder would ask you questions too. A responsible breeder should screen you or ask you about your home environment and the life you can provide for the puppy.</p><h2> Other Warning Signs of a Bad Breeder </h2><p>if the answers to the above questions are appropriate, there are still some things you should evaluate. Also, if you notice anything that just doesn't ""feel right,"" then you should do some more research on the breeder.</p><p>When talking to or meeting with a dog breeder, you must look at the facts, but also go with your gut. If something does not feel right, ask questions. If you have any doubts that the breeder is responsible, your best bet is to walk away. Start from square one, looking only for a responsible dog breeder.</p>",814

As a dog lover, you might be thinking the more, the merrier! While this is true in some ways, you still need to know that adding another dog to your household is a big decision. Think it over carefully before you decide on dog number two. There are several factors you should consider before getting a second dog.</p><h2> Is Your Dog Ready For a Housemate? </h2><p>Think about how your dog will react to having another dog in the house. Consider your dog's temperament around other dogs. Does he get along well with most dogs? Have you ever had another dog in your home to see his reaction? If your dog has any history of fighting with other dogs or any kind of dog-dog aggression, then adding a second dog is not a good idea yet. If you decide you really want a second dog at some point, then be sure to get some help from a dog trainer or behaviorist. A professional may be able to help you desensitize your dog to other dogs and possibly even become more accepting of other dogs.</p><p>There is another factor to keep in mind: Is your dog well-trained? If not, you're really going to have your hands full with a second dog. That means training each dog separately, then training the two together. It's a lot of work! Having one poorly trained dog is bad enough, but having two can cause chaos. You really need to work on training with your current dog before you get another dog. Then, your well-trained dog can actually help in training your new dog!</p><p>Does your dog have any major behavior problems? A second dog is not necessarily a solution for behavior problems like excessive barking or separation anxiety. Because behavior problems sometimes occur due to boredom and loneliness, you may think that getting your dog a companion will fix everything. Yes, it may help if your dog bonds with the new dog. However, adding a second dog could actually make the problem worse. Your new dog may even pick up some bad habits from your first dog. That's double trouble! It's best to work with a professional to address your dog's issues before you add another dog into the mix.</p><p>Does your dog have health problems? If so, are they under control? Adding a second dog to your home may cause stress that can exacerbate a medical condition. Talk with your vet and make sure your dog's health condition is as well-managed as possible. Be prepared for a possible relapse or change in the health condition after the new dog is introduced.</p><h2> Are You Ready to Take On Another Dog? </h2><p>What about ? Are you really prepared to take on the extra commitment of a second dog? You may think that having two dogs is practically the same as having just one, but this is not always the case.</p><p>First, think about the training that your new dog will need. All dogs need basic training when they first come into a new home. Some dogs will need more training than others. Once you complete some training for your new dog, you will need to brush up on the training for dog number one. Eventually, it will be time to train your two dogs together. They will need to learn how to get along, have healthy interactions, walk together, play nicely, and so on. This process will take time. In the beginning, you may need to deal with separate walks, separate living spaces, and separate feeding areas.</p><p>Did you think about the extra cost of a second dog? You have one dog, so you already know that dogs can be expensive. Now there is a second dog to pay for. That's twice the food, extra dog supplies, and double the vet bills. Plus, there are all the other little costs that may come with dog ownership, like trainers, doggy daycare, and more. Can you budget for all of that?</p><p>What happens if the two dogs don't get along? Or, what if they pick up one another's bad habits? Make sure you are willing to do the training and behavior modification work that is needed. Determine is you can afford to get help from a trainer or behaviorist, if necessary. The last thing you would want to do is give back dog number two--that would really be tragic.</p><p>If you have considered all of the above factors and decided you are ready to add a second dog, congratulations! Now it's time to choose the right second dog.</p>",768

Today, only six states have active dog racing tracks, and one of those states, Florida, has recently enacted a ban on the sport, with all active Greyhound racing tracks set to close by January, 2021.</p><p>There is a lot of controversy around Greyhound racing, from how the dogs are bred and treated to the live lures that are sometimes used to bait them around the tracks. But perhaps the biggest source of debate is what happens with the dogs when their racing days are over. It's a question that has gained heightened awareness with the news of Florida's track closures. The state, which currently houses 11 of the country's 17 active Greyhound racing tracks, will have thousands of homeless Greyhounds searching for homes when the ban goes into place.</p><p>The history of what happens to retired or injured Greyhounds is a lurid one. Prior to the widespread involvement of humane groups, many Greyhounds were simply put down when they were no longer profitable on the race track. Others were sold to labs for experimentation.</p><p>There are no verifiable statistics today on how many un-raceable Greyhounds get adopted versus those who face less humane fates. But tides have certainly turned in favor of rescue, and there are quite a few organizations that have dedicated themselves to helping as many Greyhounds as possible find their way from the track to a family home. If you're interested in adding one of these smart and sweet dogs to your own family, read on for what you need to know about adopting a retired racing Greyhound.</p><h2> What Are Retired Greyhounds Like? </h2><p>There are certainly misconceptions about what retired Greyhounds are like. Many assume that they have uncontrollable amounts of energy or that they're aggressive from years of competition. There is also an assumption that Greyhounds are no longer young and lively animals at the end of their racing days.</p><p>But fortunately, all of this tends to be false. Greyhounds are incredibly adaptable dogs who adjust well to household living and make fantastic family pets. Greyhounds are bred for speed, (in fact, these lanky, long-legged dogs are the fastest breed of canid in the world, with the ability to reach speeds of up to 43 miles per hour), but that doesn't mean that an adopted Greyhound is just going to zip around your house all day. They are notorious couch potatoes who enjoy a good nap with their humans as much as a run around the backyard.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, Greyhounds are known for their social personalities, as well as their companionability, grace, and gentleness. They do well in apartments, and don't require any more exercise than other dogs of the same size. Do note, however, that retired Greyhounds should not be allowed to roam off-leash in non-fenced areas, as their prey drive remains strong and they are hard to control once they have gone on the chase.</p><h2> Where (And How) to Adopt a Retired Greyhound </h2><p>If all of this sounds like a Greyhound is right for you, then there are many organizations you can turn to in order to adopt one.</p><p>For a list of Greyhound adoption organizations by state, visit the National Greyhound Association's adoption page.</p><p>The adoption process varies by organization. But unlike adopting retired TSA dogs or retired police dogs, there are many adoptable Greyhounds to go around, and you likely won't have to face a years-long waiting list.</p><p>To adopt a retired Greyhound, do some further research to find the organization through which you would like to pursue an adoption, and then follow the procedure outlined on their adoption page. Most of the time, you will be able to browse through available dogs just like you can for other breed rescue groups, and you will be responsible for meeting some key requirements (these vary by organization, but usually include access to a vet with experience treating Greyhounds). Rescue fees vary as well, but are generally comparable to what you would pay for other dog adoptions.</p><h2> Grow Your Family With a Rescued Greyhound </h2><p>Retired Greyhounds have so much to offer their humans, and demand very little in return aside from some love, cuddles, and a cozy coat to keep them warm in the winter months. And with so many currently needing homes and due to need homes in the near future, you have the opportunity to make a big impact not just for the dog who you adopt, but for the breed as a whole.</p><p>To learn more about adoptable Greyhounds, visit the sites of the linked organizations above and discover all that you need to know about Greyhound history, care, and how to make one a loving member of your family. </p>",791
171,https://www.thesprucepets.com/two-dogs-are-better-than-one-4174508,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>6 Reasons Why Two Dogs Are Better Than One</h1>,"<h1>6 Reasons Why Two Dogs Are Better Than One</h1><p>Having two dogs at once could seem like a lot of work, but there are a few reasons two dogs in one home-whether it's two older dogs, or an older dog and a puppy-could have benefits for you and the dogs. Dogs can keep each other company, entertain each other, and learn from each other. Whether or not you should have two dogs depends on the environment you live in, your capacity to care for them, and how any pets already in your home would deal with additional dogs. Read on to learn the benefits of having two dogs and why two dogs could be better than one.</p><h2> They'll Keep Each Other Entertained and Exercised </h2><p>Playtime is vital to any dog's health, happiness, socialization, and overall development-but it can take up a good chunk of your day. Depending on your dog's age, size, breed, and energy level, you can spend anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours a day exercising him or her.</p><p>One easy (and cute) way to ensure your doggy is getting enough exercise? Adding a second dog to the mix. You'll still have to spend some one-on-one time with each dog every day-it's actually super important for their socialization and development-but they can keep each other exercised and entertained.</p><p>Plus, they'll keep each other company when you're at work, school, or out running errands, so they're less likely to resort to boredom-induced hijinks around the house. Everyone knows a bored dog is a mischievous dog, after all.</p><h2> Make Puppy Training Easier </h2><p>It may be tough to teach an old dog new tricks, but an old dog can certainly teach a some tricks-and the rules of their house. Dogs are pack animals and look to their pack leader for guidance, a role your older dog will naturally take on when you introduce a puppy to the family.</p><p>You might find puppy training is far easier with an older dog and a new pup-the puppy will look to his senior for guidance, and model his behavior after hers. Having an older dog can make potty training your puppy easier, too. Why? Dogs tend to do their business where other dogs have already gone, so your puppy will probably poop in the same spots as your older dog.</p><h2> Help Ease Separation Anxiety </h2><p>Many dogs suffer from separation anxiety or feelings of intense anxiety that occur when they're left alone. Although some dogs will simply grow out of their separation anxiety, some cases require extra attention and solutions, like specialized training, emotional therapy, or even medication.</p><p>Some dogs may appreciate a canine companion to help keep them calm and entertained while their owner is away. Separation anxiety is a complex problem, and for some dogs, an unfamiliar dog in their house will increase their anxiety rather than lessen it. Always consult with your veterinarian or behaviorist before making a big change for any dog with separation anxiety.</p><h2> Save a Second Life </h2><p>One of the best reasons to have two dogs, rather than one, is simple: If you adopt two dogs, you're saving two lives.</p><p>It's estimated that a whopping 3.9 million dogs enter animal shelters each year-and 1.2 million of them are euthanized. You can directly impact (and save) the lives of dogs by giving them a safe, happy home. Plus, adopting dogs from your local animal shelter creates more space for other animals in need.</p><h2> It Doesn't Cost That Much More </h2><p>tip.tails / Instagram</p><p>Good news for puppy parents: You can double your cuteness without doubling your finances. Aside from regular immunizations and check-ups, having two dogs at the same time doesn't cost much more than having one.</p><p>Dogs can share many of their supplies, including toys, beds, grooming products, water bowls, larger bags of food, and treats. It is important to note that some puppy food is formulated differently than food for full-grown dogs, so talk to your vet about whether or not your pup and your older dog can share.</p><h2> Double the Love </h2><p>Why do most people add a second dog to the family? Their first dog brought so much love and joy into their homes, and they want more! There's nothing better than coming home to a pet who loves you unconditionally-and you can double down on that love with a second furry family member.</p><p>Having two dogs can feel like a lot of work sometimes, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. From easier training to better mental and emotional health (for you and your dogs!), to saving the lives of animals, there are so many solid reasons to adopt a second dog today.</p>",768
172,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-a-seizure-dog-4685729,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>What Is a Seizure Dog?</h1>,"<h1>What Is a Seizure Dog?</h1><p>Seizure dogs are specially-trained service dogs that assist people who have seizures. Just as service dogs can be trained to assist blind or wheelchair-bound persons, some can be trained to respond to seizures. Seizure dogs are trained to assist their handlers before, during, and after a seizure. These intelligent working dogs love their jobs and it shows. Not just any dog is eligible to become a seizure dog, and not all who go through training will make the cut.</p><h2> What is a Seizure Dog? </h2><p>Seizure dogs are sometimes called seizure alert dogs, seizure assistance dogs, seizure detection dogs, or seizure response dogs. Not all of these are exactly the same.</p><p>Seizure alert or detection dogs can sense a seizure coming on before it begins. This is likely due to the subtle changes that occur in the pre-ictal phase (the period before the seizure). The dog is trained to display behavior that tells the handler a seizure is coming, such as staring, pawing, or nosing at the handler. This enables the handler to get to safety before the seizure begins. Seizure alert or detection dogs can be trained to act as seizure response dogs as well. When also trained to respond to seizures, they are often called seizure assistance dogs or simply seizure dogs.</p><p>Seizure response dogs are not always seizure alert or detection dogs. Seizure alert dogs are trained to respond to a seizure by assisting the handler or finding help, but they are not always able to alert the handler of an oncoming seizure. They will try to protect their handlers from injury during a seizure and find help when necessary. They are trained to stay near the handler during the seizure and protect from injury. They are also trained to alert another person if the handler needs help. A seizure response dog is often trained to perform helpful tasks like fetching items that may be needed (medications, phone, alarm or alert device), opening or closing doors, and turning lights on and off.</p><p>Seizure dogs are also trained to behave well in all places and accompany the handler obediently. They walk calmly with their handlers without pulling the leash or harness handle. When the handler is seated, the seizure dog is quietly by the handler's side.</p><p>A seizure dog is paired with a person who suffers from seizures, sometimes an epileptic, and the two become a team. In general, the seizure dog will go everywhere with the handler. In the event that a seizure begins, the dog will respond in the best way to help the handler. These dogs are trained to perform a variety of tasks in all types of situations.</p><h2> How Dogs Become Seizure Dogs </h2><p>Not every dog has the right personality, temperament, and skill set to become a seizure dog. Some organizations have breeding programs while others will work with rescue dogs or mixed breeds. Dogs are assessed as young puppies and enter an intense training program if they are deemed appropriate. Those with the right attributes begin the early phase of the program as young as eight weeks old. They first undergo basic socialization, obedience training, and house training. They are continually screened for temperament and health to make sure they are still right for the job.</p><p>Dogs that do well in the early phases move on to more advanced training. In general, a seizure dog is trained over a period of about two years before being teamed up with a handler. In most cases, the handler will also need to complete a training course. Training continues once the handler and dog are off on their own.</p><p>There is some uncertainty among experts as to a dog's natural ability to sense a seizure coming. Some believe this is a natural talent only possessed by certain dogs. Others feel that all dogs have the ability to sense a seizure before it starts, they just need to learn how to display this knowledge to the handler. This is why some dogs are trained to be seizure detection or alert dogs and others simply as seizure response dogs.</p><h2> Life With a Seizure Dog </h2><p>Seizure dogs form very close bonds with their handlers. The team is more than just dog-handler; it is a relationship of mutual companionship. However, seizure dogs don't have to be in work mode all the time. Once the harness comes off, they know that they are essentially ""off the job."" This is a time when they can act a little more like pets, playing and relaxing. Fortunately, most will still be ready to act appropriately if their handler has a seizure.</p>",764

Once you have decided what type of dog is right for you, it is time to start looking for your new dog. There are many options out there, but some are better than others. Research the organization or person from whom you will get your new dog to determine if they are reputable. Then, go see the location where the dogs are kept to make sure your new dog comes from a healthy environment. Please consider dog adoption first. </p><h2> Animal Shelters </h2><p>These can be great places to look for a new dog. Though lots of dogs in shelters are mixed-breed dogs, many times you can even find a purebred dog! Shelter dogs often have previous training and socialization, though others may come from troubled backgrounds. Talk to the shelter staff members and volunteers about each dog you are considering to get an idea of background and personality.</p><h2> Rescue Organizations </h2><p>Rescue groups are dedicated to finding the best families for homeless dogs. Some are even devoted to specific dog breeds. Most rescue organizations keep their dogs in foster homes until they can find forever homes for them. These foster parents have usually forged a bond with the dogs and can tell you a lot about their history and personalities. Rescue organizations are typically very selective because they care so much about getting their dogs into the right homes, so be prepared to answer a lot of questions.</p><h2> Reputable Breeders </h2><p>If you choose to purchase a purebred dog, be certain you find a knowledgeable, responsible breeder with a good reputation, not a backyard breeder or puppy mill. Ask your vet and other dog owners for referrals, or get a referral from a rescue organization recommended by a national kennel club, such as the AKC Breeder Referral Contacts. A responsible breeder should be willing to show you the premises and tell you about the parents' histories. Be certain that the breeder's home or kennel is clean and odor-free. The adult dogs and puppies should appear healthy and lively. If you are not comfortable with the breeder, do not purchase a puppy.</p><h2> Precautionary Notes </h2><p>do not purchase your new dog from a pet store. Tragically, these dogs are often from puppy mills. Though you might be ""saving"" the dog from poor conditions, you are supporting a terrible industry that should be put to an end. Some online kennels are puppy mills too, so do your research before doing business with an online kennel. Ideally, you should be able to visit the kennel first.</p><p>Be careful about getting your dog through newspaper ads and signs with statements like ""free to a good home."" Unfortunately, these dogs might come from poor conditions and irresponsible dog owners. Not only might you end up with an unhealthy dog, but you may also be encouraging inconsiderate people who do not spay and neuter their pets.</p><h2> Making Your Final Decision </h2><p>Once you think you have found the right dog, make sure he appears healthy. He should be bright-eyed and lively with a shiny coat and a good appetite. If the puppy or dog has special needs of some kind (usually due to physical or temperament issues), make sure you are prepared to handle them. Be aware that dogs or puppies that show signs of aggression, fear, or other behavior problems will likely need extra training and attention from you. It does not mean that the dog is any less worthy of a good home, but you should know what you are getting into. It is certainly not good for anyone if you have to return your new dog or puppy to the breeder, shelter or rescue group.</p><p>Before bringing your new dog home, you should obtain a new dog/puppy packet from the breeder or adoption group that contains general information about caring for your new dog. Make sure your home is prepared for a new dog. Also, be sure to bring your new dog to a vet for a general examination right away. If you adopted your dog, know what to expect for the first few weeks. If you are getting a puppy, learn all about proper puppy care.</p><h3>Watch Now: If Your Dog Could Text, They Would Say This</h3>",723
174,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-to-adopt-a-pet-4178919,Dogs > Getting Started > Dog Adoption,<h1>5 Reasons Why You Should Adopt a Pet</h1>,"<h1>5 Reasons Why You Should Adopt a Pet</h1><p>Are you in the market for a little more love in your life? Adopting a pet is one of the very best ways to bring more happiness into your world. And when you adopt from a shelter or rescue organization-instead of buying from a breeder, the pet store, or a stranger over the internet-you get the added benefit of saving the life of an animal in need. Win-win!</p><p>Adopting a dog or cat (or rabbit, guinea pig, lizard, etc.-you'd be surprised how many animals are available for rescue) is a big decision, but if you know for sure that you're ready for the responsibility, head to the shelter, and not the backyard breeder.</p><h2> You'll Save Two Lives </h2><p>Adopting an animal from a shelter or other type of rescue organization not only saves that one animal's life, but it also saves the life of another animal who can now take the empty spot you've opened up. It's a double good deed and a second chance for two animals who might otherwise not have gotten one.</p><h2> You'll Save Money </h2><p>Purchasing a fancy breeder dog or cat can set you back thousands of dollars, and that's even before you get to the standard costs of annual pet care. Buy a pet from a pet store and not only will you be spending an equally large amount of money, but you'll also be pretty likely to get an inbred animal from a puppy mill who is prone to expensive medical conditions.</p><p>In comparison, the adoption fee you'll pay at the shelter is usually just a couple of hundred dollars (often way less!), and that almost always includes spay/neuter and initial vaccinations. Many open-admission organizations, such as your local animal care and control facility, also regularly waive their fees to help encourage adoptions when kennels are filling up.</p><p>And that money you're spending isn't going into someone's pocket-it's directly subsidizing the care of other animals while they wait to find their forever families.</p><h2> Do Your Part to Put a Stop to Commercial Breeding </h2><p>Puppy mills, also called commercial breeding facilities, are nightmares for the animals who find themselves there. Dogs and cats are kept in cages their entire lives, without proper nutrition, medical care, or companionship, and with no opportunity to get outside or experience love.</p><p>They have one purpose: to breed whatever trendy purebred puppy or kitten is currently in high demand, the bulk of whom are shipped off to pet stores and sold on the internet (the less lucky ones become breeder animals themselves).</p><p>If it's unsavory to think about, it's even less savory to perpetuate. Puppy mills exist because of demand-if you adopt a pet instead of purchasing one, that's one less customer for the mills and one step closer to a world without them.</p><h2> You'll Get an Amazing Animal </h2><p>All animals are different, and no animal is perfect. But rescued animals have a unique way of connecting with their humans. Maybe it's their gratitude for being saved, or perhaps it's the extra love they inherently warrant by nature of coming from a tough circumstance. Whatever the reason, a rescue pet will light up your life and bring near endless joy.</p><p>And forget what you've heard about shelter animals being ""damaged;"" many of them are perfectly healthy, both physically and emotionally, and even those with harrowing pasts can often learn to love and trust humans.</p><h2> You'll Join a Community </h2><p>Rescue organizations love their animals, and they will usually go out of their way to keep tabs on them. From alumni meet-ups and Facebook groups to adopter appreciation events and fundraising efforts, there are plenty of ways to stay involved and become part of a larger community of animal lovers.</p><p>In addition to being a great way to meet people, the rescue community is also a great resource when you need care advice or are looking for a pet sitter. Plus, it's always great to have an enthusiastic audience for your endless stream of pet photos.</p><p>Rescuing a pet is one of the most gratifying things you can do in your life. And with so many millions of animals waiting for a home, you can almost always find whatever breed or personality you're looking for.

Congratulations on deciding that you are ready to become a dog owner. Before you can go out and choose the right dog for you, you must find out if you are allowed to have a dog in your rental home.</p><h2> Are Pets Allowed in Your Rental? </h2><p>One of the potential drawbacks of renting a house or an apartment is having to accept pet restrictions. Your lease may not state that pets are prohibited, but it may have been implied when you first moved in. Or, your lease may specifically state ""no pets"" or ""no dogs."" If this is the case, you likely won't be able to get a dog until you move elsewhere. Do not attempt to sneak in a dog or you could end up facing fines or even eviction.</p><p>When you first signed your lease, your landlord will likely have made it clear whether the ""no pets"" restriction was negotiable or not. However, if you have lived there for a while, it may be worth asking again. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to change your landlord's mind.</p><p>Property owners have good reasons for not wanting dogs on rental properties. Irresponsible dog owners are notorious for damaging floors, irritating neighbors, having smelly apartments, leaving messes everywhere, and being obnoxious in general about their dogs. From your landlord's perspective, it may not be worth taking the risk.</p><h2> How to Ask Your Landlord if You Can Have a Dog </h2><p>Many landlords may have initially allowed pets in their rental units, but one or two bad experiences likely soured them on the idea. If a previous tenant allowed their dog to destroy a room or barked all night causing numerous complaints, you are going to have a hard time convincing him that you will be different.</p><p>You may be able to sway your landlord in your favor if you are willing to sign and abide by a written agreement stating your intentions and obligations as a pet owner. Your landlord may already have such an agreement for you to sign. If not, you may wish to present your landlord with an agreement to show you are committed to being a responsible pet owner.</p><h3>Sample Pet Agreement for Tenant</h3><p>Failure to abide by these rules will result in the dog's relocation and re-homing, or the tenant's relocation. The tenant understands that failure to adhere to this agreement is considered a violation of the lease/rental agreement.</p><h2> Negotiating With Your Landlord </h2><p>Consider asking your landlord if he has any specific concerns he wants to address and add them to your contract. He may want you to adhere to certain size restrictions, or even have certain breeds he doesn't want in his building. He may ask that you avoid puppies or high-energy dog breeds.</p><p>Because your landlord has the ultimate say, it's in your best interest to agree to his terms. It is ultimately his property, and he has the right to set force any rules and regulations that he wants. Your willingness to comply may make him more likely to soften up his demands.</p><p>In addition to signing a contract, you should offer to pay a pet deposit. Your landlord may require this even if you do not offer. Offering one before he requires one is a gesture of good faith (or a preemptive strike).</p><h2> Living With a Dog in Your Rental </h2><p>If you are able to convince your landlord you let you get a dog, that's great news! If you've agreed to certain terms, be sure to honor them when searching for your new dog. Once you have found your new canine companion, it's essential to follow the terms of your agreement while living in your rental home with your dog. This will not only make life easier while you live in the rental; it can also help you get a good reference from your landlord if you eventually move out and need to rent another property.</p>",669
