These freshwater fish can tolerate smaller tanks with some tank water fluctuations and are a peaceful species. However, there have been no cases of successful breeding of this species in a home aquarium meaning that all specimens have been removed from their wild habitat.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Candystripe loach, crossbanded loach, lined loach, striped loach, tiger loach, zebra botia, zebra loach</p><p>Scientific Name: </p><p>Adult Size: 4 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The coloration of the Zebra Loach is the basis for its scientific name, , which is derived from the Latin word , meaning striped or striated. There have been other scientific names given to this loach, most notably .</p><p>Although possibly not indigenous, each species originates in a different location.  is found in Malaysia, Thailand, and the Greater Sundra Island, while  hails from the Tunga River system in Karnataka, located in the southern part of India. Zebra loaches have also been found in several areas within the Krishna drainage. Althe waters are clear in some of these regions, other locations this fish inhabits are muddy and oxygen-poor. It is not unusual to find zebras in the company of different Botia species.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>One of the smaller members of the Botia family, the Zebra loach reaches a maximum adult size of about four inches, although they often are a bit smaller. The head of this loach is blunt with three pairs of barbells that grace the nose, one maxillary set, and two rostral pairs. Young specimens have a red nose that fades as they grow older</p><p>Zebras are boldly marked with vertical stripes, giving them their most widely known common name. The stripes on the head slant backward, while the stripes in the mid-portion slant forward and those near the tail are almost vertical. These stripes vary in width, from narrow to thick, sometimes breaking up in such a way as to give the appearance of a maze.</p><p>Zebras are striped over the entire body, including the head and fins, with the only exception being the belly, which is cream-colored and free of any stripes or patterns. The color of the stripes varies, from pale yellow to deep brown to gray, and may even take on a blue or greenish hue. This variety of colors in each individual gives rise to another common name, the candy stripe loach.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Zebra loaches are peaceful and prefer to live in small shoals that typically cruise the tank together. They are more active at night than during the day but are still more active during the day than most members of the loach family. Generally speaking, they are not aggressive and can be kept with many other species. However, their boisterous nature can stress fish that are timid or shy.</p><p>Zebras are an excellent choice for the community tank, but they must be kept in groups of at least five or more of their own kind. They will tolerate other Botia species quite well, and will even school with them. Other potential tankmates may include tinfoil barbs, and they also enjoy the company of the popular clown loach.</p><p>Avoid keeping them with other small bottom-dwelling fish, such as members of the cory family, as they compete for space and can exhibit aggression in these situations. Also to be avoided are fish with long fins, such as angelfish and bettas. Even long-finned guppies or small tetras may be picked on by the zebra loaches.</p><h2>Zebra Loach Habitat and Care </h2><p>Although more active during daylight hours than other loaches, lighting should be somewhat subdued. The zebra loach still requires a habitat with plenty of hiding places to help them feel fully secure. Driftwood, piles of smooth rocks, flower pots with openings, or simply large tubes will all suffice as shelters. Plenty of plants, either real or artificial, will round out the habitat. Take care to ensure that all decor is free of sharp edges, and make sure all openings are large enough to ensure that loaches will not become trapped.</p><p>Zebras love to rummage for food morsels and even burrow into the substrate. Their barbells are quite sensitive and are subject to irritation if the substrate is too rough. Therefore, the substrate should be soft; either smooth-edged fine gravel or sand. The tank should have a well-fitting cover, as this fish will escape if it finds a large enough opening. Filtration should be sufficient to maintain high water quality, and weekly water changes are important.</p><p>Zebras cannot tolerate elevated organics or water chemistry fluctuations. They should not be introduced to a newly set up aquarium or a mature aquarium that has an excessive build-up of organic waste. Water temperatures should be 73 to 79 F with soft and slightly acidic pH (6.0 to 6.5).</p><p>It has been reported that when stressed, they are more susceptible to Ich infection. Observe them closely for signs of Ich whenever moving them or making other potentially stressful changes to the habitat.</p><h2>Zebra Loach Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Zebra loaches are omnivores and readily accept a wide range of foods. They are particularly fond of live foods, such as bloodworms, glass worms, tubifex, daphnia, and brine shrimp. Additionally, zebra loaches are avid consumers of snails, making them a great means of keeping snail populations under control</p><p>In addition to live foods, they also will eat fresh vegetables and even fresh fruits. Flake, freeze-dried, and frozen foods are also accepted and add to a balanced diet. Sinking foods are helpful in a community aquarium, to ensure the bottom-dwelling Zebras get their fair share at feeding time.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are no obvious external differences that can be seen between the sexes, although mature females may be a bit more rounded in the abdomen than males.</p><h2>Breeding the Zebra Loach </h2><p>Zebra loaches were first introduced to the aquarium trade in 1952, and have continued to remain popular among aquarium hobbyists; specimens sold in the trade are either wild-caught or captive-bred. While breeding this species in captivity has been unsuccessful for the home hobbyist, commercial breeding has been successful through the use of hormones.</p>",1009
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/zebra-danio-1378473,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Zebra Danio (Zebrafish) Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Zebra Danio (Zebrafish) Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>Zebra danios are a favorite of freshwater fish hobbyists because of their ease of care. They are also prolific breeders and the easiest type of egglayers to breed. With their attractively striped, black and white zebra-patterned bodies, these fish are easy to recognize. Zebrafish are very durable and can withstand an impressive range of water temperatures and conditions. They will generally do just fine without a water heater as they are comfortable at temperatures down to the low 60s F. Unlike most fish species, they are loyal to their breeding partner and mate for life.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Striped danio, zebra danio, zebrafish</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Zebra danios were originally thought to have originated from a wider range that stretched from Myanmar in the east and Pakistan in the west; however, the current consensus is that this species originates from a much narrower range that is contained to parts of India and Bangladesh.</p><p>Part of this change in distribution is due to the identification of similar species that were once misidentified as being Danio rerio. Damage to the environment that resulted in a reduction of habitable areas has also narrowed their natural range, even though wild zebra danios utilize a variety of habitats, ranging from fast-moving streams to slow-moving, nearly stagnant ponds.</p><p>Zebra danios available in the aquarium industry are now almost always captive-bred as zebras are easy and inexpensive to raise. While commercial breeding has provided a large and unlimited supply of this species, it has also resulted in a fish that is less robust than the original wild species.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The zebra danio is easily recognized by its distinctive horizontal stripes. Blue-purple horizontal stripes run from gill to tail, setting off the slim, compressed, silver-gold body of this attractive fish.</p><p>Albino, golden, veil-tailed, and long-finned zebra danio varieties are available, as well as a popular leopard variety. The leopard strain is characterized by a sprinkling of black spots over the entire body. In the past, the leopard danio was considered a different species, but genetic studies have proven that it is merely a spotted variation of Danio rerio.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The small size of the zebra danio, no more than two and a half inches, makes them well suited to a community aquarium. Zebra danios are peaceful fish that get along with most tankmates, however, they will nip fins of some species. Any fish with long-flowing fins, such as angelfish, bettas, and guppies, are potential targets of the active zebra danio. Good potential tankmates may include barbs, corydoras catfish, similar-sized gouramis, loaches, and swordtails.</p><p>All varieties thrive in schools and should never be kept as singles. They do best when kept in a school of five or more of their own kind. Groups of this fish can be hierarchal, and a pecking order may emerge in the school, but there is no infighting. Select tankmates that are similar in temperament and that can keep up with the fast-paced behavior of this danio. Mellower fish that need a less hectic environment can become stressed in their presence.</p><h2>Zebra Danio Habitat and Care </h2><p>Zebras are primarily surface-dwelling fish that favor moving waters. Technically considered a cold-water fish, this fish prefers water in the 64 to 75 F range. However, they will adapt to a wide range of water conditions. If water temperatures are kept too low, they tend to become more susceptible to disease.</p><p>Zebras are extremely active, and although they have a preference for the upper levels of the aquarium, they will move throughout the entire tank. Provide them with diffuse lighting and an open swimming space with vegetation around the periphery of the habitat. A darker color substrate will help showcase the color of these fish and give the habitat a more natural feel.</p><h2>Zebra Danio Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Zebra danios are omnivorous, accepting almost any food. Although undemanding in diet, they particularly enjoy small, live, or frozen invertebrates and fresh vegetable matter.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Both sexes have two pairs of barbels and the same stripes, but females are usually larger. Males are a bit smaller and more slender than females. Male zebras appear more torpedo-shaped, while females tend to have a larger belly. More full-bodied than the males, a female's belly balloons when it fills with eggs.</p><h2>Breeding the Zebra Danio  </h2><p>Zebra danios are ideal for beginners as they are prolific breeders, and interestingly, mated pairs remain together for life and rarely spawn with others, even if a mate dies. The best way to obtain a mating pair is to start with a school of a half dozen or more young zebras and allow them to choose mates.</p><p>Set up a separate breeding tank with shallow water, approximately six inches deep. Furnish the tank with fine-leafed plants. Course gravel works well as the eggs will fall between the gravel pieces and will be protected from the adult fish, which will readily eat their own eggs.</p><p>Spawning requires temperatures of up to 78 F and can be triggered by raising the water a few degrees near dawn when spawning normally occurs. About 300 to 500 eggs will be scattered across the bottom and on the plants. Remove breeders after spawning, as they will also consume the young as they hatch.</p><p>The fry will hatch in two days. They are very tiny and can easily be lost when changing water, so take care when maintaining the nursery tank. Feed the young commercially prepared fry food or finely crushed dry foods. You can also add a powdered egg to fry food to promote growth.</p>",910
67,https://www.thesprucepets.com/yo-yo-loach-1381074,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Yoyo Loach Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Yoyo Loach Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>This yoyo loach has several names, including the Pakistani loach from its place of origin and the reticulated loach from its giraffe-like pattern. Sometimes incorrectly referred to as a scaleless fish, it actually has very small scales embedded in its skin. A bottom-dwelling fish, it is an active scavenger. The yoyo is semi-aggressive, although it lives well with its own species.</p><p>The name yoyo loach, according to several sources, came from photographer Ken Childs, a major player in the aquarium import business for many years. There are two very different versions of why he dubbed this fish the ""yo-yo."" One version claims that the fish were so active that they were bouncing like yo-yos. The other relates to the fish's color pattern, especially in the juveniles of the species. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Yoyo loach, Almorha loach, Pakistani loach, Reticulated Loach, Y Loach</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches (7 to 13 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 8 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The yoyo loach comes from slow-moving and still freshwater rivers in India and Pakistan. It prefers to congregate in still pools with rocky substrates where there is plenty of aquatic vegetation and food. Loaches spawn upstream and then make their way downstream to live most of their lives.</p><p>Yoyo loaches from Pakistan are usually darker than those from India; it's not clear whether there is an environmental reason for this, or whether the loaches are actually different species.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The yoyo loach is silver with dark markings that look very much like the letters Y and O. The letters are most clear when the loach is young, giving way to a more solidly reticulated pattern as the fish matures. When engaged in mock-fights or hiding, the yoyo loach's markings can dim to gray, but they quickly return to normal. The silver color can also appear bluish in certain light.</p><p>The mouth of the yoyo loach points downward, sporting four pairs of barbels. When excited its coloration can fade out, and it is not unusual for this species to play dead, much like its cousin the clown loach. The yoyo has great character and has been known to recognize its owner. The yoyo loach also makes a clicking sound when feeding on the surface. It does so by swallowing air and forcing it through the gills.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>If you keep a single yoyo loach, there's a good chance it will team up with other fish in the tank. While this may not be a problem, it's best to keep a shoal of at least three, preferably more. Do not keep them with large or aggressive tankmates. Because loaches can be very active and social, it's also best to avoid tankmates that are shy or slow-moving. Small catfish or other small peaceful fish are suitable companions for yoyos.</p><h2>Yoyo Loach Habitat and Care </h2><p>The yoyo loach hails from still waters in India and Pakistan; it prefers warm, soft, acidic water. Perform frequent water changes and keep the lighting subdued. It's very important that the water be very clean and well-oxygenated. Your filtering system should be very efficient, and you should plan to replace tank water on a regular basis (15 percent per week).</p><p>When first introduced to the tank, yoyos are nervous and may hide. Be sure to provide them with ample hiding places, including spots where they can squeeze in and feel safe. Once acclimated, they will spend more time in the open. They are most active at night and enjoy burrowing into the substrate by day. If you think you are missing a loach, don't be surprised if you find it hiding under the gravel. Because yoyo loaches can and do jump when startled, it's a good idea to have a tight-fitting lid on your aquarium.</p><h2>Yoyo Loach Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Loaches enjoy eating meaty foods, but are omnivorous; they can eat vegetation foods when insects and other animals are scarce. Because they are versatile, yoyo loaches are easy to feed. They'll eat almost anything they are offered, from flake to frozen to freeze-dried foods. A few sinking pellets fed just before turning the lights out will quickly be devoured.</p><p>They are peculiarly fond of live foods and will gorge themselves on bloodworms and brine shrimp. They also will consume any snails they find in the tank, sucking them right out of their shells. To maintain good health, provide a variety of live foods.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Both sexes are similar, but males are generally more slender than the females who become noticeably fat when full of eggs. Males also may show a red color around the barbels.</p><h2>Breeding the Yoyo Loach </h2><p>It is not unusual for mature females to fill with eggs, although they have not been seen to spawn in captivity. It is extremely unlikely that your yoyo loaches will breed while living in your aquarium.</p>",797

They're also easy to find, and relatively inexpensive. Their bright yellow color is very attractive, and many beginning aquarium hobbyists enjoy watching them graze on algae in large saltwater tanks. It's important to be aware, however, that yellow tang can be aggressive, are prone to the fish disease called ""ich,"" and may damage coral in your reef tank.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Yellow surgeonfish, yellow Hawaiian tang</p><p>Scientific Name: </p><p>Adult Size: Up to 8 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 years in the wild, 10 in captivity</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Even though the yellow tang is considered endemic to Hawaiian waters, its distribution extends from the Hawaiian area, including Johnston Island, westward through the northern Marshall Islands to Wake, Marcus, Guam, and other Marianas Islands.</p><p>The habitat of this fish is from inside the reef out to depths of 100 feet or more. The larger specimens seem to stay in the shallow waters near the reef, while the juveniles usually prefer the deeper waters where finger corals are present.</p><p>A vast majority of the yellow tang collected for aquarium use are harvested from the Kona (west) Coast on the Big Island of Hawaii. The easterly currents that flow up the west side of the Big Island from the nutrient-rich depths of the Pacific Ocean provide the perfect environment for breeding and growing this pelagic fish.</p><p>During its earlier years, this fish prefers the company of other yellow tang and has a tendency to follow other yellow tang and can actually be herded like sheep under the right conditions. They prefer to reside in Staghorn Coral fields at depths above 50 feet where they can find easy cover from predators and plenty of easy access to green algae which is their preferred food.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Yellow tang start life as clear larvae before developing their distinctive narrow, oval-shaped, bright yellow body. They have long snouts and seven fins including their spiny dorsal and anal fins. They also have a sharp white spine on both sides of their tails which they can use to fight or defend themselves.</p><p>Surprisingly, yellow tang actually change color over the course of the day. During the daylight hours, yellow tang are bright yellow all over except along their spines. At night, their color changes to a dark, grayish-yellow with a white lateral stripe (sometimes called a ""nocturnal stripe""). </p><p>The yellow tang is covered in mucus, which it secretes from its skin. The mucus forms a protective layer that keeps away parasites and bacteria. The mucus also makes the yellow tang's body less resistant to the water, so it can swim faster.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>In general, this fish does get along well with other fishes in an aquarium, but it can be aggressive towards other yellow tang and surgeonfish if they are not introduced into the aquarium at the same time. If your tank size will allow you to include several of these fish, you will be entertained by their lazy ""follow the leader"" patterns in and through live rock arrangements.</p><p>Yellow tang can be included in a marine reef tank setup, but do keep a close eye on them. While they do graze on algae (which can help keep the coral clean), they may also damage some species of coral. Aggressive behavior can also be an issue.</p><h2>Yellow Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>Yellow tang need plenty of space (tanks should be over 50 gallons) and to explore every part of the tank. It is a hardy, strong fish and is fairly easy to care for. However, it is a fish that is prone to contracting saltwater ich diseases (whitespot and blackspot forms ) and possibly HLLE (head and lateral line erosion). The ich factor makes it a less than ideal choice for a beginner just starting or cycling a tank because stress is greatly related to these diseases. Use caution when handling this fish, as the white razor spur near the tail area is very sharp and can cause cuts or injury.</p><h2>Yellow Tang Diet </h2><p>This fish is an herbivore, grazing on algae and other plant life. It is best kept in an aquarium that has good algae growth, where in turn they earn their keep by helping to keep the algae growth cropped. It will feed on nori (dried or roasted seaweed), other green vegetable matter and vitamin-enriched flakes, but may nibble at dried shrimp and other meaty fares as well. Use a lettuce clip or place the nori under a rock or piece of coral. This mimics its natural feeding habits. In the wild, its lifestyle is one of constant cruising and grazing.</p><p>If you want to be sure the yellow tang maintains its beautiful color, avoid feeding it meat. You can, however, feed it vegetables such as zucchini, broccoli, and lettuce.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Male and female yellow tang look very similar (though the female is often larger than the male). When mating, however, males change color and have a ""shimmering"" behavior which makes them identifiable.</p><h2>Breeding of the Yellow Tang </h2><p>In the wild, yellow tang travel alone or in loose schools, and spawn around the time of the full moon. Yellow tang are group spawners, but it is extremely difficult to breed these fish in captivity. Only since 2015 have researchers managed to keep a group of juvenile yellow tang alive past the larval stage. This achievement has significant potential for increasing the availability of pet yellow tang. </p>",888

It is very robust and is easy to breed. This species is also a peaceful addition to a freshwater aquarium community.  White skirt tetras can live up to seven years, and they are a visually striking fish. Be aware, however, that some breeders will artificially color their white skirt tetras, creating a range of pretty-looking fish that are unfortunately very likely to have many health issues and to lose their color after a very short time in your home tank.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: White skirt tetra, petticoat tetra, gold skirt tetra</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches (5.5 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>There is no such thing as a wild white skirt tetra; the white skirt is simply an albino or no-pigment variation of the black tetra (and is only bred in captivity. The black tetra inhabits the Paraguay and Guapore Basins in South America. In these habitats, they prefer still and slow-moving waterways, and they tend to congregate in shady areas under dense foliage. They feed on insects, worms, and crustaceans which they find toward the surface of the water. White skirt tetras are not an endangered species as they are bred entirely in captivity.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>This species is a color variation of the popular black widow tetra (black tetra). They achieve their mature size of two inches at approximately one year of age. A number of long-finned and colored varieties have been produced.</p><p>Most notable of the color variations are the man-made pastel blue and pink fish, which are achieved with the use of dyes. The dyed individuals may be sold under names such as strawberry tetra, blueberry tetra, or rainbow tetra. Any fish that may have been artificially colored should be avoided. Fish dyeing is a harmful, inhumane practice that should not be supported.</p><h2>About Artificially Dyed Fish </h2><p>Albino or nearly-transparent tetras are the strains of fish that have been artificially dyed. While these artificially-colored fish are very attractive, there are serious health issues related to the process of dying fish.</p><p>As you search for a fish to place in your tank, be wary of those with unique colorings and ""pretty"" names; do some research to be sure the fish is displaying natural colors. Otherwise, you may be in for a shock when your ""blueberry"" fish shows its true (white) colors and subsequently comes down with a disease.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A schooling fish by nature, white skirt tetras are best kept in groups of three or more. Due to their peaceful nature, they make excellent community fish. Some owners report that they sometimes nip the fins of slower moving fish, however, only those with long flowing fins such as bettas or angelfish.</p><h2>White Skirt Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>White skirt tetras are an undemanding species that will adapt to a range of conditions. Subdued lighting, as well as neutral-colored gravel substrate, is preferred. Their originating species is accustomed to large plants in their natural habitat so these also enjoy a planted aquarium.</p><p>Water parameters may range from acidic to alkaline and from hard to soft. Ideally, they should initially be matched to the water conditions from the supplier. White skirt tetras are hardy in the wide range of 70 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit; when they are kept at colder temperatures, they become prone to developing white spot disease (known as ich).</p><h2>White Skirt Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>White skirt tetras are not picky eaters as they are omnivorous. As a result, virtually any kind of live, fresh, frozen, freeze-dried, or flake foods is suitable. For optimal health, provide a variety of foods that include high-quality flake foods, brine shrimp, and any type of worm, as well as vegetable supplements such as spirulina.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Female white skirts are generally larger than males and have a rounder body. Males have a broader anal fin and a narrower, more pointed dorsal fin.</p><h2>Breeding the White Skirt Tetra </h2><p>Larger males will generally claim a territory that they will guard during spawning periods. Although they are egg scatterers, they prefer to spawn among fine-leaved plants which you should provide in the breeding tank. Once spawning has occurred, the parents should be removed as they will consume the eggs.</p><p>Eggs will hatch after approximately one day. The fry (baby fish) may be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp, egg yolk, or finely ground flake foods.</p>",735
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/white-cloud-mountain-minnow-1380870,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>White Cloud Mountain Minnow Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>White Cloud Mountain Minnow Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>White cloud mountain minnows are small, colorful fish, once termed ""the working man's neon"" because they compared to neon tetras in color but were not as expensive. For over a half-century the white cloud mountain minnow was the only species in the genus. However, in 2001, two additional species found in Vietnam were recognized; and . Of those two, only (Vietnamese white cloud) is available in the aquarium trade.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Canton danio, Chinese danio, white cloud, white cloud mountain fish, white cloud mountain minnow</p><p>Adult Size: 1 1/2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 to 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The geographic origins of this fish in China and Vietnam have undergone significant changes, which have negatively impacted its habitat. This has had a deleterious effect on the habitat, and slowly the species has disappeared. Beginning in 1980, the species had not been seen in nature, leading to the belief that it had become extinct in the wild.</p><p>Fortunately, a small number of native populations have been discovered in isolated locations within the coastal province of Guangdong and Hainan Island in China, as well as in Quảng Ninh province in Vietnam. The species is still very rare in the wild and is considered an endangered species in China. Efforts are underway to reintroduce captive-bred populations into the wild, but currently, all-white cloud mountain minnows sold in the aquarium trade are captive-bred.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>White clouds grow to an adult length of 1 1/2 inches (4 cm), the males being more slender and colorful than the females. They are top- or middle-dwelling fish and are rarely seen in the bottom region of the aquarium.</p><p>The mouth of the white cloud mountain minnow slants upward, with the lower jaw slightly protruding. They possess no barbells, and the dorsal fin is positioned past the mid-line of the body, in line with the anal fin. The body is a shimmering bronze-brown, with a fluorescent line running from eye to tail, where it ends in a dark spot surrounded by brilliant red. The belly is whiter than the body, and the anal and dorsal fins are both splashed with red and edged in white. Several color variations exist, including a golden variety as well as a long-finned variant known as the meteor minnow.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>White cloud mountain minnows should be kept in good-sized schools, preferably of a half dozen or more. When kept singly, they tend to lose color and hide most of the time. They are peaceful and fit well with other small peaceful fish. Avoid larger tankmates, as they will be inclined to eat white cloud mountain minnows. The same is true of any aggressive species.</p><p>Often they are sold as companions for goldfish, due to both species preferring colder water temperatures. However, goldfish can and often do eat fish the size of white cloud mountain minnows. Therefore, combining these two species in the same aquarium is not a good idea.</p><h2>White Cloud Mountain Minnow Habitat and Care </h2><p>When kept in the right temperature range, this species of fish is very hardy and well suited for the beginner hobbyist. Although undemanding when it comes to water quality, this minnow does not deal with heat well. There is evidence that keeping white cloud mountain minnows in water that is constantly above 72 F (22 C) will shorten their lifespan.</p><p>Substrate for the white cloud mountain minnow tank should be fine and darker in color, with plenty of vegetation as well as some rocks and driftwood. Leave an open area for swimming and offer subdued lighting to bring out the colors of this fish. Water hardness and pH are not critical, but it is wise to avoid extremes. Avoid the use of all medications containing copper, as white cloud mountain minnows are very sensitive to copper.</p><p>White cloud mountain minnows are sometimes kept as a pond fish to help control the breeding of mosquitoes. Keep in mind that they cannot be kept with large pond fish, as they will be eaten. They do, however, make good companions for African dwarf frogs. While they tolerate cool water, they cannot be left in outdoor ponds in the winter in areas where the water freezes.</p><h2>White Cloud Mountain Minnow Diet and Feeding </h2><p>White cloud mountain minnows eat all types of food, including live, frozen, and flake food. In their native habitat, they are voracious insect eaters. They particularly relish mosquito larvae, daphnia, and brine shrimp. Feed a good variety of dry and frozen foods, including live foods whenever possible.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Sexual differences are slight, and determining the gender accurately can be difficult. Males are more slender and brilliantly colored than females. Females that are ready to spawn have a fuller abdomen.</p><p>White clouds reach sexual maturity between six months and one year of age. When mature enough to spawn, males display against each other, spreading their fins and displaying their most vibrant colors, in the hopes of attracting a female.</p><h2>Breeding the White Cloud Mountain Minnow </h2><p>White cloud mountain minnows are easy to breed and are a good choice for first-time breeders. They are egg-scatterers that breed year-round. The mating pair provides no parental care to the young.</p><p>You may take two approaches to breeding them. One is to keep a large school of white clouds (and only white clouds) in their original tank and allow them to breed there. Because these fish are not as aggressive about eating their eggs and their fry as other fish, some of the young will survive if there are plants and other hiding areas near the bottom of the tank.</p><p>Another option is to set up a small breeding tank of five to 10 gallons in size and add a couple of the most colorful males and twice as many females. The tank should be equipped with a spawning mop and/or clumps of plants where the fish can deposit eggs. For spawning, the water should be soft, with pH in the range of 6.5 to 7.5, and the water temperature of 68 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit. No substrate is necessary if setting up a separate breeding tank. Gentle filtration, such as a sponge filter, is recommended.</p><p>Regardless of the method used, the fish should be conditioned with live foods before spawning. Live foods are ideal for conditioning, particularly the brine shrimp, daphnia, and mosquito larvae. High-quality frozen foods can be used if live food is not available.</p><p>Once spawning begins, eggs will be scattered over the plants or spawning mop for up to 24 hours. The eggs will hatch in 36 to 48 hours. Remove the parents once the eggs begin to hatch out. Fry should be fed very fine micro-foods or liquid fry food initially, followed by freshly hatched brine shrimp. The young will grow rapidly and are easy to care for.</p>",1123

It is also known as the blotched upside-down catfish because of its spotted appearance. They are an extremely popular species that have been admired for countless centuries; their images have even been found in ancient Egyptian art.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Upside-down catfish, blotched upside-down catfish</p><p>Adult Size: 4 inches (20 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This fish originates in Central Africa in the Central Congo River basin from Kinshasa to Basonga. It is also found in Cameroon. It inhabits the densely vegetated areas at and around the banks of rivers.</p><p>Although they swim faster when upside down, don't be surprised if they swim right-side-up for periods of time. This is particularly true when they want to graze the bottom of the tank for morsels of food. Upon closer examination of the inner structures of this catfish, scientists found that its swim bladder was normal and there was nothing unusual about the balancing organ of the ear, as it resembles that of other catfish.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Considered a dwarf catfish, reach an adult size of only three to four inches. Like other members of the Mochikidae family, they have large eyes, a large adipose fin, a forked tail, and three pairs of barbels. Their light brown colored body is covered with dark brown blotches of various sizes.</p><p>These fish have color-adapted to spend most of their time upside-down. The underside of the body has a darker hue, which is the opposite of fish that swim upright. This reverse coloration serves to camouflage them when they swim upside down at the surface of the water. </p><p>Like other catfish, they have sharp fin spines that can cause injuries to fishkeepers or that can become entangled when moving them. Take care to use a very fine mesh net while catching or moving this fish. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Upside-down catfish are good community fish. A peaceful species, they can be combined with many other species successfully. Despite its amicable nature, it is still a carnivore that will eat very small fish. It is best kept in small schools; maintain a group of at least three to four, which will give them confidence and encourage them to come out of hiding.</p><p>Do not keep this fish with other fish that are large enough to even attempt to predate upon it. It will erect its spines and become lodged in the predator's throat. For this reason, it is wise never to house this catfish with aggressive fish. The most appropriate tankmates include African tetras, dwarf cichlids, such as or , and small elephantfish.</p><h2>Upside-Down Catfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Well suited to the aquarium environment, the upside-down catfish is easy to care for. Aquarium temperature is not critical but water should be moderately soft and with a slightly acidic to neutral pH. As they are very sensitive to nitrates, good water conditions are necessary. Frequent partial water changes are needed to keep them healthy.</p><p>This catfish also typically requires water that is well-oxygenated, and it prefers a relatively strong current. This can be achieved by using powerheads or a spray bar water return attachment on a canister filter. For shelter, provide hiding places that are situated directly in areas of heavy current. </p><p>A well-planted tank is ideal, preferably using broad-leafed plants, as they like to browse the undersides of leaves. Driftwood, rock arches, and rockwork decorations are appropriate. Caves that provide places to hide are recommended. It is quite normal for this fish to hang out and congregate on the underside surfaces of rocks, leaves, and driftwood, so offer multiple underneath surfaces that are big enough to accommodate your whole school at once. </p><p>Like most catfish, it tends to hide during the day, becoming active at night and during the dusk hours, so adequate hiding spaces are a must. Use a moonlight lighting fixture to view their night activities.</p><h2>Upside-Down Catfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In nature, the upside-down catfish feeds primarily on insects at the surface of the water, and it often scavages the undersides of submerged branches and logs for worms, insects, and micro-organisms. Swimming upside-down makes these areas easier to access. Omnivores, they will also graze on the available algae to supplement their diet.</p><p>In the aquarium environment, they adapt readily to all types of foods, from dry to live to frozen. Offer some sinking catfish pellets, freeze-dried bloodworms, tubifex, and frozen foods like bloodworms and blackworms. For optimum health, provide a varied diet that includes insect larvae when possible, particularly mosquito larvae. Live foods offered at the surface of the water or below will always be readily accepted. Feed vegetable matter in the form of shelled peas and cucumber even if they clean your aquarium algae.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Females are larger, paler in coloration, and have plumper more rounded bodies, particularly when ready to spawn.</p><h2>Breeding the Upside-Down Catfish </h2><p>Only a limited number of successful spawnings have occurred in an aquarium. Upside-down catfish prefer cave spawning. Offer an overturned clay flower pot or two or even some PVC pipe as a possible spawning location. Condition the breeders with live foods. Soften the water and use a water can sprinkler to add colder water to the tank, mimicking the spring rains. This will increase the likelihood of successful breeding.</p><p>Eggs will generally be laid on the roof of the cave, and up to 450 eggs may be laid. Unlike South American catfish, both parents may be left in the tank after spawning, as they will tend to the brood. The eggs hatch in approximately two to three days and the fry will feed off the yolk sac, which they carry for an additional four days.</p><p>Once the yolk sac has been consumed, they will begin eating freshly hatched brine shrimp. They initially swim in the upright position before moving into the typical inverted position. After two months, the fry will begin swimming in the characteristic upside-down way.</p>",987
34,https://www.thesprucepets.com/triggerfish-family-balistidae-profile-2925851,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Triggerfish Family Balistidae Profile</h1>,"<h1>Triggerfish Family Balistidae Profile</h1><p>Most Triggerfishes are brightly colored and marked with patterns of lines and spots. They are easily recognized by their deep flat bodies, small pectoral fins, small eyes placed high upon the head, and rough rhomboid-shaped scales that form a tough covering on their body. Near the area in front of the tail, they have some prickly, spike-like rows of spines that discourage predators. Also because of the rough, spike-like texture of these fish's bodies, they can easily get snagged in an aquarium net, causing some scale damage.</p><h2>Triggerfish Characteristics </h2><p>These fish have an angular-shaped head that extends into a long snout-like nose that possesses very strong jaws and a small mouth full of eight heavy-duty teeth.</p><p>Triggerfishes range in average size from about three to twelve inches, with some larger species reaching up to 14 or 16 inches, and a few growing to about two feet.</p><p>Triggerfishes are easily recognized and named for, you got it, their flexible trigger spines. This fish has a top dorsal spike that can be put into an up or down position at will. At the bottom of the body, there is another smaller, permanently extended type trigger that can be flexed as well. When one of these fish feels threatened, is ready for sleep at night, or wants to secure itself against strong surge-zone wave action, it will go into a hole and stick up its top trigger, flex the bottom one, and then lock them both into place. This lodges the triggerfish firmly in its hiding hole.</p><p>The force of the two triggers used in conjunction with one other firmly wedges the fish into place. Once a triggerfish has ""triggered in,"" it is next to impossible to remove it from its hiding place.</p><p>If at some point you see a Triggerfish laying on the bottom of the tank or propped up against a tank wall, don't worry, it is how these fish sleep when there is no shelter available to take cover in.</p><p>Triggerfishes are capable of making noise much like that of a pig grunting when disturbed or agitated.</p><h2>Species Classification </h2><p>It is important when identifying these fish that you refer to them by their Latin or scientific names. Because triggerfishes are collectively referred to as Humu-Humu's worldwide, and often other common names are applied to more than one species, this does not identify which individual triggerfish species you may have or are considering buying.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Triggers are extremely territorial and seem to be on the move most of the time. In general, they do get along with most other fish. They need plenty of room to move around, as well as establish a territory of their own with as little infringement from other tank mates as possible. With a tendency to be aggressive towards other triggerfishes, especially those of the same species and sex, putting them together is usually not a good idea.</p><p>Their nature can be unpredictable. Sometimes they can harass and pick on other fishes, and other times they may get along just fine. When keeping other fish with a trigger, the closer the other fishes are the same size as the trigger, the less chance harassment will occur.</p><p>It is best to place triggers in an aggressive fish-only tank community along with other larger non-related species such as groupers, lionfishes, snappers, eels, hawkfishes, tangs, and surgeonfishes.</p><p>Because these fish eat a wide variety of crustaceans and invertebrates, they are not considered suitable for live rock or reef aquariums that may have these types of marine life present.</p><h2>Triggerfish Habitat and Care  </h2><p>Triggerfish are bottom dwellers and usually live in the shallower, inshore areas of coral reefs. They are very active fish and need plenty of room to move around. They should only be kept in larger aquariums, of course, unless you have a smaller species that grows to only about two or three inches. Be sure to learn about any particular type of trigger you want to purchase. Remember, some species grow to a very large size of up to 14 or 16 inches. It is best to provide these fish with plenty of rocks, stones, or coral formations to hide in. The more objects for them to hide around, behind, or under, the better.</p><h2>Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Triggerfishes are one of the easiest of all marine fishes to care for. Most all species adapt quickly to aquarium life, are very hardy, and will eat just about anything you offer them as food, including fingers.</p><p>Triggerfish are carnivores that spend their days nibbling on a wide variety of echinoderms and crustaceans like crabs, shrimps, sea urchins, worms, and other invertebrates. They are not coral eaters, but they may have a tendency to pick at clams and other animals that may be attached to corals or live rock.</p><p>When looking for food in the sand, some triggers will tip up on their nose and ""blow"" the sand to uncover a potential meal. It is interesting to watch them eat a sea urchin. They will pick off all the spines, turn the urchin over to expose the more vulnerable area of the urchin, and with their front two bonded teeth and strong jaws, they break it open. Triggers do not attack other fish for the purpose of eating them, but they are opportunistic and will feed on the flesh of dead fish.</p><p>Triggers are messy eaters, which can contribute to high aquarium maintenance requirements, as well as result in water quality issues, particularly in small water volume aquariums. By setting up a good regular tank cleaning routine and removing larger excess pieces of food that are not eaten in a reasonable amount of time, these problems are less likely to occur.</p><p>Triggerfishes can be fed frozen vitamin-enriched preparations suitable for carnivores, as well as herbivore rations with marine algae for a balanced diet. Fresh meaty foods such as chopped shrimp, squid, clams, and fish can be offered, and soaked in a liquid vitamin (such as Selcon) to supplement their dietary requirements.</p>",989

It is not, however, an ideal fish for a community tank as it can be mildly aggressive and nip any fish with flowing fins. When well cared for, tiger barbs have a lifespan of five to seven years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Tiger barb, sumatra barb, and partbelt barb</p><p>Adult Size: 3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The tiger barb is native to Borneo and Malaysia, including Sarawak and Kalimantan. They can also be found on the island of Sumatra and in Thailand and Cambodia. Non-native tiger barbs have been introduced in Singapore, Australia, the United States, and Colombia.</p><p>In their native habitat, these fish inhabit quiet, tree-lined rivers and tributaries filled with sand, rocks, and thick vegetation where they can find insects, algae, invertebrates, and detritus from plants. They prefer clear, highly-oxygenated water.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Four tiger-like black vertical bands on an orange-yellow body make it obvious where this member of the barb family got its common name. Red-edged fins and a red face add even more color to the popular tiger barb. In recent years, selective breeding has created several color variations that include green, black, red, and albino. A genetically modified glow version of the tiger barb occurs in many colors.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Reaching an adult size of 2 1/2 to 3 inches, they are large enough to avoid being eaten by large fish, yet small enough to keep a school of them in a modest-sized aquarium. For a striking display, set up a species-specific tank with a half dozen of each color variation of tiger barb, complemented by live plants.</p><p>Provided there is considerable space, one of the best tankmates for the tiger barb is the similar looking clown loach; it will even school with the tiger barbs and act as they do. Alternatively, pair the tiger barb with fast-moving tankmates such as danios, platys, loaches, or catfish.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>When kept singly or in groups of two to three, tiger barbs will terrorize almost any fish that is unfortunate enough to reside in the same tank. Yet if they are kept in groups of a half dozen or more, they will usually keep their quarreling to themselves. Regardless of the numbers kept, it is never advisable to keep tiger barbs in the same aquarium with docile, slow-moving, or long or flowing-finned fish, such as the angelfish, guppies or bettas.</p><h2>Tiger Barb Habitat and Care </h2><p>Tigers barbs tolerate a wide range of water conditions, but do best in soft, slightly acidic water. The ideal tank should have a large open area for swimming with an abundance of live or artificial plants around the periphery of the tank. Temperature is not critical, and this fish can even be kept in an unheated tank. Provide good lighting and a fine substrate to complete the setup.</p><h2>Tiger Barb Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Accepting of virtually any food, tiger barbs should be given a variety of foods to maintain a healthy immune system. Include quality pelleted or flake food, as well as live and frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and beef heart. They will quickly gobble up small aquatic invertebrates and even cooked vegetables.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Females have a broader, more rounded belly than males and are larger and heavier. Males are identified by their bright coloring and the red nose they develop during the spawning process.</p><h2>Breeding the Tiger Barb </h2><p>As egg-scatterers that provide no parental care, tiger barbs will eat their own eggs if they have the opportunity. Therefore, it is advisable to set up a separate breeding tank that can double as a grow-out tank for the fry. To acquire a breeding pair, keep at least a half dozen barbs and allow them to pair off. Condition the breeders with live foods, and once a pair has been established, move them to the separate breeding tank.</p><p>The breeding tank should have soft, acidic water, fine-leaved plants, and a bare bottom. Some breeders use marbles or a spawning grid on the bottom, which allows the eggs to drop safely out of the parents' grasp. Keep in mind that if the bottom is bare, it is particularly critical to observe closely, removing the parents immediately after spawning and before they can consume their eggs.</p><p>Spawning will usually take place in the morning. If the breeding pair does not spawn within a day or two, a partial water change with water that is a degree or two warmer than the tank water will usually trigger spawning. If more intervention is still necessary, lower the tank water level by an inch, then use a watering can sprinkler to add the colder make-up water to the tank. The sprinkling vibrations mimic the conditions of the natural rainy season, sending more of the appropriate hormonal cues that it is time to spawn.</p><p>The female will lay about 200 transparent- to yellowish-colored eggs, which the male will immediately fertilize. As soon as the eggs have been fertilized, the breeding pair should be removed. The eggs will hatch in approximately 36 hours, and the fry will be free-swimming after five days. Feed the fry newly hatched brine shrimp until they are large enough to accept finely crushed flake food or commercial powdered fry food.</p>",894

As bottom dwellers, they enjoy sifting through gravel and other substrates in search of food, which helps to keep the aquarium free of detritus. As with all of the cory catfish, their breeding rituals is an interesting display of parental investment, although these fish do not rear their young.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: False julii cory, leopard catfish, leopard cory, three-line catfish, three-lined cory, three-stripe cory, trilineatus cory</p><p>Adult Size: 2.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>commonly referred to as the three-stripe or leopard cory, originates from the central Amazon River basin, in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, as well as in coastal rivers of Suriname. They inhabit small creeks, rivers, and ponds in flooded forest areas. Quite often, this species is mistakenly sold as a far less common cory species, The two species are very similar and have been crossbred, resulting in hybrids that carry traits of both. is another related species that bears similar markings.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>reaches a maximum adult size of 2 1/2 inches and is covered in overlapping scales referred to as plates or scutes. The body is pale silvery gray, with a narrow dark stripe that runs along the lateral line from the gill cover to the base of the tail. On either side of this stripe is a pale space, beyond which are rows of spots.</p><p>The caudal fin is transparent with rows of dark spots that form stripes vertically through the tail. The dorsal fin is colorless with a large black spot on the upper portion, and the adipose and anal fins are also transparent with a row of spots running through them. The head is covered in spots that combine in a mottled pattern, and the mouth is surrounded by sensitive barbels.</p><p>As with many catfish species, the pectoral, dorsal, and adipose fins have a spiny fin ray that can be locked, making them difficult for a predator to swallow. This fin feature can be problematic when netting this species, so some owners find it easier to catch them in a solid, transparent container rather than a net.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Like all , this species should be kept in schools of a half dozen or more. They are peaceful but should not be kept with large or aggressive species. They do well with small to medium-sized companions, such as danios, dwarf cichlids, gouramis, rasboras, tetras, and other small catfish species.</p><h2>Three Stripe Cory Habitat and Care </h2><p>This species is the most comfortable in a tank with a sandy soft substrate with plenty of hiding places as well as some open spaces. Driftwood, plants, and dim lighting complete the habitat nicely. These fish tolerate a range of water conditions but prefer soft to moderately hard water with an acidic to neutral pH. Maintaining good water quality is important for this species, as well as for any speciesAlso, do not introduce this species into a newly set up aquarium, as they are not tolerant of changes in water chemistry. Contrary to some reports,are not tolerant of salt treatments.</p><h2>Three Stripe Cory Diet and Feeding </h2><p>An omnivorous species in the wild, the three-lined cory feeds on insects, inverts, worms, and plant matter. Although they benefit greatly from live foods whenever they are available, their diet in the home aquarium should include a high-quality sinking tablet or pelleted food. They will scavenge the bottom for food that is leftover from the surface and from the mid-water feeders, but that will not be sufficient to keep them healthy. Supplement the pellets with frozen live foods or small live worms fed on tongs when they are available.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Sexual differences are more noticeable when this species is viewed from above; females have a broader body that is clearly rounder than the male. Overall the female is larger even when viewed from the side.</p><h2>Breeding the Three Striped Cory </h2><p>Three-striped corys are relatively easy to breed, using the techniques for breeding other cory species. Ideally, set up a breeding tank separate from the main tank which can then be used to grow the fry. In lieu of a breeder tank, a grow-out tank can be set up to move the eggs to for hatching and rearing.</p><p>The breeding tank should have a very fine smooth gravel or a sandy substrate. A bare bottom is also suitable. Water should be soft with a slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.5 to 7.0) and maintain a temperature of approximately 75 F (24 C). Filtration should be gentle to avoid drawing small fry into the filter; a sponge filter is an ideal choice. Provide a spawning mop or fine-leafed plant such as Java moss. </p><p>As with other cory species, when breeding, there should be more males than females. A ratio of three males to two females is suitable. Condition the breeder group with live foods, such as bloodworms or daphnia. Use frozen or freeze-dried counterparts if actual live foods are not available.</p><p>When the belly of the female becomes plump with eggs, perform a water change with very soft water that is several degrees lower than the water in the tank. This will help trigger spawning. If spawning does not occur, repeat these daily large water changes as previously described. Increasing aeration also aids to trigger spawning.</p><p>Spawning typically begins with increased activity, with the males actively pursuing females. When a female chooses to accept a male, they will assume the well-known ""T-position,"" in which the female is positioned with her head against the mid-portion of the male. The male will clasp the barbels of the female with his pectoral fins, while the female forms a basket with her pelvic fins, into which she will deposit up to four eggs. It is believed that the sperm pass through the gills of the female and are directed to the eggs being fertilized. Once the eggs are fertilized, the female will find a desirable spot to attach these adhesive eggs. This process will continue until 100 to 150 eggs have been laid.</p><p>The adults will neither guard nor care for the eggs once they have been laid. In fact, they will consume the eggs and must be separated from them if the fry are to be preserved. Eggs will readily become infected with fungus, and many are lost this way. Adding a few drops of methylene blue to the water will reduce the chances of losing eggs to fungus. Eggs may still fungus, so watch them closely and remove any eggs that develop fungus, or it will quickly spread. Cherry shrimp may be kept in the grow-out tank, as they will consume any fungused eggs while leaving healthy eggs untouched.</p><p>Eggs will hatch in three to five days and should then be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp, micro-worms, or rotifers. Very fine fry food is also an option, but with any food, you need to remove any uneaten portions promptly. Any deterioration in water chemistry can be fatal to the young fry.</p>",1169

This sparkly and beautifully speckled fish, however, is also known for its aggression. Specimens grow very large, requiring large habitats and tolerant tankmates. When these fish outgrow the aquarium, they should not be released into the wild. And yet, non-indigenous populations are now fished as a food source and for sport.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pearl cichlid, Rio Grande cichlid, Rio Grande perch, Texas cichlid</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Texas cichlids are native to lakes and rivers in south Texas and northern Mexico, making them the most northern naturally occurring species of cichlid in the world. It is also the only cichlid native to the United States. Having been imported to Europe as early as 1912, it was among the earliest cichlids imported to Europe from the Americas.</p><p>Popular within the aquarium hobby, Texas cichlids are commonly stocked in most shops, sometimes under the name pearl cichlid or Rio Grande perch. The latter name comes from an area where it is often found, the lower Rio Grande River in Texas. Specimens sold in shops are often captive bred.</p><p>This species has also been introduced into areas where they are not indigenous, sometimes on purpose, but often by aquarium owners desperate to divest themselves of a fish they can no longer take care of. The areas of non-indigenous populations range from northern Texas to Florida, where it has become a popular game fish with a flavor similar to that of tilapia.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Texas cichlids are a large and aggressive fish that can reach up to a foot in length, although most sold in the aquarium trade attain an adult size that is a bit smaller than that. The body of this species is pearl-gray with blue- to green-hued scales that give the appearance of pearly iridescent speckles. The iridescent speckling extends into the fins. A dark spot is clearly visible at the base of the tail, and several more spots or bars are in the center of the body.</p><p>Mature males develop the traditional nuchal hump on the head above the eyes. When spawning, the fish assumes a striking half and half coloration, with the front portion of the body becoming white, and the rear and underbelly being black, or black-and-gray barred.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Texas cichlids are aggressive, which must be kept in mind when selecting tankmates. Other large Central or South American cichlids are suitable tankmates, as are oscars, silver dollars, and tinfoil barbs. When kept with other large species, the tank should be as large as possible to allow space for each to have their own territory.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Texas cichlids should only be kept with other large species of fish that are capable of fending for themselves. When spawning, they should not be kept with any other fish, as they are quite likely to kill any other fish in the tank. This is true of even their own species, as spawning pairs are highly aggressive.</p><h2>Texas Cichlid Habitat and Care </h2><p>When considering tank size, bigger is always better for this species. The minimum tank size is 55 gallons for a single specimen and 75 gallons for breeding purposes. When keeping Texas cichlids are kept with other large fish, the tank should be 125 gallons or larger. Filtration should be robust, as this species is sensitive to organic waste. Perform weekly partial water changes to ensure water chemistry remains optimal.</p><p>Anyone who has kept this fish is well aware that attempting to craft a beautifully aqua-scaped tank is a losing battle because this fish is an avid digger that will uproot plants and move small rocks and other items of décor. That doesn't mean the tank should be devoid of plants or anything else, but be aware that it will be rearranged regularly at the whim of the fish.</p><h2>Texas Cichlid Diet and Feeding </h2><p>This species is omnivorous and needs meaty foods balanced with vegetation. They are not fussy eaters and will eat virtually anything, including live, frozen, flake, and pelleted foods. Provide live foods when possible, such as worms and insects or insect larvae. Fresh vegetables can be fed as well, as well as spirulina flakes or pellets to keep their natural colors bright and to maintain health.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Sexual differences are not always clearly evident. However, males are usually brighter in color and iridescence, grow a few inches larger in size, and typically grow a protruding nuchal hump on their head. It has also been observed that the fins of the males are longer and more pointed. One way to pick out female specimens is by the black spots located on their dorsal fin that are absent in male specimens.</p><h2>Breeding the Texas Cichlid </h2><p>Texas cichlids are prolific, egg-laying, open spawners, which are easy to breed. Water in the breeding tank should be soft to medium-hard (5 to 12 dGH), pH neutral (7.0) and between 77 to 82 F (25 to 28 C). Decorate with large rocks or clay pots to provide a choice of spawning locations.</p><p>Breeding pairs are best obtained by purchasing a group of half a dozen young fish. Allow them to grow to maturity together so that pairs will form. Once a pair has formed, they should be separated to prevent them from attacking, or killing, other fish. Condition the breeders with live foods, if possible, or good-quality frozen foods. When the pair is ready to spawn, their coloration will change dramatically. The head and the front portion of the fish will be white, while the belly, as well as the rear portion of the fish, will be black. An active courtship takes place, in which the pair will lock lips, slap tails, and dig in the substrate.</p><p>After cleaning the chosen spawning location, the female will lay 500 to 1,000 adhesive eggs. This takes place in several batches with the male following the female to fertilize the eggs after they are deposited. The parents will guard the eggs, which hatch in two to three days. The fry will become free swimming by day four or five. Inexperienced breeders will sometimes consume their young, but will not do so in subsequent spawnings.</p><p>The fry will accept freshly hatched brine shrimp either fresh or frozen. In lieu of brine shrimp, commercially prepared fry foods can be used. As the fry grow, finely crushed flake foods can be given before small pellets can eventually be offered.</p>",1075

Originating from Mexico and Central America, the Swordtail has been bred in captivity for countless generations. There are many varieties widely available to the aquarium community, including the naturally colored green swordtail, as well as neon, pineapple, painted, marigold wag, red wag and hi fin lyretail.</p><p>Some websites and pet stores offer ""specialty"" varieties that are not found anywhere else. Keep in mind that many of these unique breeds are generated through several generations of inbreeding. Although their external appearances many be very distinctive, they may also have internal issues with limited immune function and longevity.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Swordtails are named for the male's elongated ventral aspect of their tail fin, creating a ""sword""-like appearance. They are bred in a wide variety of colorations. Among the varieties of swordtails, you can expect vibrant reds, yellows and blacks with a mix of bars and stripes. There are also longfin varieties of swordtails that have elongated dorsal, pectoral and tail fins to add to their eccentricity.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Swordtails do best living in a group, so plan on at least 4-5 individuals per aquarium. You are welcome to mix different varieties together, but be ready for a swarm of baby swordtails if you mix males and females. Being live-bearing fish, swordtails can reproduce very quickly, reaching sexual maturity as early as three months of age. Some potential tankmates include Neon Tetras, Coolie Loach or Corydoras.</p><h2>Swordtail Habitat and Care </h2><p>Swordtails do well in many different aquarium setups. These easy going fish are good for beginners and a colorful addition to any community tank. They are active fish, so make sure there are not too many decorative items in their way. The best combination for swordtails is to keep your décor and plants to the lower half to 2/3 of your tank and leave the top of the tank open for active swimming.</p><p>Male swordtails may take up territory and become aggressive towards other fish. Be sure to have plenty of room for all your swordtails, despite their small size! It may help to add fake or live plants to give your fish more hiding areas.</p><h2>Swordtail Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Swordtails are omnivores that enjoyed a varied diet. Depending on the water temperature, you may need to feed your fish 2-3 times per day. Many tropical fish like to forage throughout the day, so fewer feedings are not ideal for swordtails. Swordtails do well on most community micropelleted diets, and also enjoy occasional frozen and freeze-dried treats.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Swordtails have specific characteristics to easily differentiate male and female fish. Males have the characteristic ""sword"" on the ventral aspect of their tails. Females have a rounded tail edge and tend to have thicker bodies. This comes from carrying all their live baby fry. The anal fin is also pointed in males and fan-shaped in females. This can be used to determine gender in young fish before the males develop their long sword tail.</p><h2>Breeding the Swordtail </h2><p>Livebearer fish, such as swordtails, can easily over populate an aquarium. Many beginners are not aware of the swordtail's livebearing abilities and are suddenly surprised by a swarm of baby swordtails. Many swordtail owners start with just a few swordtails, not realizing that the females may be pregnant when acquired. Even one pregnant swordtail may surprise a novice fish owner with a sudden population explosion.</p><p>Swordtails can become mature as early as 3 months old and birth up to 50 fry per spawning. If you don't want more baby swordtails, it is critical that you separate males from females before they reach reproductive maturity. As previously noted, males have the distinctive ""sword"" on the ventral aspect of their tail fin, and an elongated anal fin, making the identification easy.</p><p>Over several generations, you may note an increase in your fry deaths, or your fish may not live as long. If you continue to breed the same populations, you can expect to have health issues resulting from inbreeding . The best fix for this is adding a little genetic diversity through the purchase of new fish or trading with another hobbyist. Unless you know your new fishes' health history, before adding them to your aquarium it is always recommended to quarantine your new fish yourself.</p>",797

The swallowtail species is specifically named for its tails' butterfly-like appearance.</p><p>Tails aside, the swallowtail is unique among angelfish species in that it does not pick food out of coral crevices, making it suitable for reef tanks because it will not destroy the coral. This angelfish can get up to seven inches long and prefers a lot of swimming space, so you will need a large tank at least 125 gallons to house a swallowtail.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black-spot angelfish, spotbreast angelfish, Japanese swallowtail angelfish, blackspot lyretail, and zebra angelfish</p><p>Adult Size: 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This angelfish species is found around Fiji, Indonesia, and Vanuatu islands in the Pacific Ocean. This species inhabits moderate to deep waters on steep slopes. A single male is usually seen with several females. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The swallowtail angelfish is also called a blackspot angelfish because of the black spot located on the male's breast. The female is yellow dorsally and light blue ventrally. The caudal fin is marine-blue highlighted by a dark, blue-black edging on the top and bottom. The male is marked with a series of vertical red stripes covering the entire pale-colored body. The tail of the male is forked and is yellow with blue edges. </p><p>Swallowtails have small mouths lined with three or four rows of small bristle-like teeth, often with tips that have three points. Their teeth are shorter than the rest of the members of the Pomacanthidae family, obviously a reflection of their feeding tactics of picking prey out of the water column versus removing algae from coral's encrusting rubble.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Swallowtails will not attack the vast majority of fish, as they are rather peaceful themselves, but may chase after small peaceful planktivores like Anthias fish.</p><p>Be careful not to mix swallowtail angelfish with fish that are outwardly aggressive. They may be dominated by larger aggressors. Such aggressive fish include triggerfish, large angelfish, and most surgeonfish.</p><p>Males will fight with males from their species, other genus males, and those fish that have similar coloration. To avoid problems, keep this fish alone, as a mated pair, or as a small group of females with one male in a larger aquarium.</p><p>Ideal tankmates include clownfish, blennies, gobies, chromis, butterflyfish, small lionfish, and eels.</p><h2>Swallowtail Angelfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>In the aquarium trade, the swallowtail angelfish is considered fragile and therefore difficult to ship. But, if you can find a healthy specimen, it will settle into aquarium life rather quickly. </p><p>Because of its size and constant roaming nature, the minimum aquarium size suggested for this fish is at least 125 gallons. You should offer lots of hiding places. This type of angelfish makes a good reef dweller that will not nip at stony and soft corals (sessile invertebrates). </p><p>Provide areas of strong water movement in the aquarium during the day. Use pumps on timers that can be turned off after 8 to 10 hours. Well-oxygenated water is optimal. Lids are necessary as this fish may attempt to jump out of open aquariums.</p><h2>Swallowtail Angelfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Naturally a planktivore, this is an angelfish that often dines on diatom and filamentous algae in aquariums. It should be fed a varied diet of meaty fares, such as finely chopped fresh shrimp and frozen silversides, frozen brine and mysis shrimp, and marine algae-based foods such as dried seaweed (nori), enriched flake food, or pellets containing spirulina that are suitably sized for angelfish.</p><p>This fish will gulp food from the water's surface and may swallow air at the same time. It is not unusual for the fish to become bloated, resulting in it appearing to be struggling while swimming head down. But don't worry, it gets rid of this trapped air by expelling bubbles from its mouth and anus. In other words, it burps and farts. Feeding sinking food will help prevent it from ingesting air at the surface.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>This is one of a few angelfishes that can easily be identified as male or female, because of their distinct differences in appearance (called sexual dimorphism).</p><p>The male is marked with thin, dark vertical bands that cover the body from the head to where the dorsal and anal fins end. It has a yellow band at the base of the tail.</p><p>The female is blue, fading from darker at the head to lighter near the tail. The dorsal fin is mostly yellow, fading into the midsection of the body. The white tail is outlined in black. </p><p>This species of fish is known as a protogynous hermaphrodite, which means it is a female when it hatches. Then, if there is no dominant male presence in the immediate environment, the dominant female of the local group will spontaneously become a male. Swallowtail angelfish reportedly take up to 30 days to complete this sex change.</p><h2>Breeding the Swallowtail Angelfish </h2><p>Males entice females to mate with several different movements or fin gestures. Swallowtail angelfish males roll onto their sides or backs in front of females, or position themselves directly in front of the female and tremble or quiver their caudal fin. If the male is successful in his initial attempts to lure a female, he continues the mating ritual.</p><p>While positioned alongside the female, the male's entire body will vibrate or quiver excitedly. The female will then extend all of her fins as a sign of encouragement. After a few seconds of the male nuzzling his head near the rear of the female, the pair will roll onto their sides and release their eggs and sperm. </p>",935
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/suckermouth-catfish-species-profile-5079535,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Suckermouth Catfish: Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Suckermouth Catfish: Species Profile</h1><p>Suckermouth catfish is the common name for members of the Loricariidae family of catfish. It includes 92 genera and over 680 species, only of a few of which are common in the pet hobby. Also known as a plecostomous or pleco, these fish are common in tropical community fish tanks. They are characterized by their mouths that are used to suction themselves to rocks, wood or the sides of your aquarium.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Suckermouth Catfish, Plecostomous, Pleco</p><p>Adult Size: 3 inches to 2 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Native to the rivers of South America, the suckermouth catfish is only one member of the plentiful Loricariidae family. Also known as Pleco Hypostomous or ""Plecostomous,"" these fish have been captive-bred for many generations. They are an invasive species within the Americas, Asia and Europe.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Suckermouth catfish are known for their scales or bony plates that look like armor. These dense scales may have extra ridges that give the fish a spiky appearance. The suckermouth catfish is mainly brown in coloration with darker spots and/or stripes. Some fish may have tan or yellow patterns. This excellent camouflage makes them difficult to see in heavily planted tanks.</p><p>The suckermouth catfish is named for their specialized oral cavity. Their raspy mouthparts are specially designed to grind up plant materials and have evolved to allow the fish to breathe while staying suctioned to a flat surface.</p><p>The Loricarridae family have a unique feature of their eyes that allows them to see well in many different water environments. Instead of a traditional iris, they have an omega iris, which is a dorsal fold of their iris extending into the anterior chamber of the eye. By moving this up and down, they control how much light enters their eye, allowing them excellent vision in both brighter and darker water.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Being mainly herbivorous and a peaceful fish, the suckermouth catfish gets along with many other community players. Even when they reach their maximum size, around a foot or two, they will leave other fish in the tank alone. Some good tank mates include smaller fish, such as platys or neon tetras, or larger tropical fish such as rainbowfish or congo tetras. You may add multiple Loricariids to one tank, but keep in mind how many gallons each fish will need!</p><p>Despite some online postings, the suckermouth catfish and its various plecostomous cousins are not well suited to outdoor ponds. These fish require a smaller range of water temperatures than most ponds can supply. If your pond is heated year round, as long as you have temperature checks in place, you may consider moving larger suckermouth catfish to your pond.</p><h2>Suckermouth Catfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>The biggest consideration when keeping a suckermouth catfish is having enough room for your fish when they reach full size. Although they start very small, you will need at least 125 gallons per fish.</p><p>Many tanks with suckermouth catfish are heavily planted with lots of natural woods for the fish to nibble upon. Whenever you are adding wood to a fish tank, be sure it is a species of wood that will not leach any toxic substances, such as eucalyptus, and has been thoroughly cleaned. Once you have a good piece of safe wood, allow it to soak in chlorinated water for at least 24 hours. Rinse it thoroughly before adding it to your aquarium. You can skip this step by only purchasing woods made specifically for aquariums, but always rinse them first to remove dust.</p><h2>Suckermouth Catfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Although mainly herbivorous, like all other fish, the suckermouth catfish needs to have a well-rounded diet and cannot subsist on the algae in your tank alone. Many herbivorous fish pellets are available with a flat disc shape ideal for suckermouth catfish. The suckermouth catfish does well on a mix of herbivorous/omnivorous foods and like a wide variety of commercially available tropical fish diets.</p><p>Supplementing with vegetables is an enjoyable task when keeping suckermouth catfish. There are a variety of fresh vegetables you may add to your tank for the benefit of all your fish, not just your suckermouth catfish. Again, this should not be the bulk of their diet, but an occasional supplement. Most of their nutrition should come from their pellets.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Unlike other varieties of plecostomous, the suckermouth catfish does not have any distinct external features to determine males vs. females. As with many other species of fish, female suckermouth catfish tend to have larger, rounder bellies, whereas the males tend to be slender and skinny. However, this may be hard to determine without two fish of the same age and care. Underfed or sick females will easily resemble males.</p><h2>Breeding the Suckermouth Catfish </h2><p>Once you have a male and female in the same system, the suckermouth catfish likes to spawn on smooth rocks and divots in your substrate. This will often occur in a quiet corner of the aquarium that is not easily accessible. Females will lay the eggs and males will externally fertilize the eggs within the new nest. Males will remain to guard the nest until the fry hatch.</p>",850

They have characteristic large eyes that help them see in low light and a spiny dorsal fin that make it easily identifiable among other fish. It is so named because it can make a squirrel-like noise with its swim bladder.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Red and white striped squirrelfish, Hawaiian squirrelfish, yellow-red squirrelfish</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 4 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The striped squirrelfish occurs on coral reefs of the Indo-West Pacific from southern Red Sea and East Africa to New Caledonia, north to southern Japan, and south to Australia. In Australia it is found from the offshore reefs of north-western Western Australia and from the northern Great Barrier Reef to northern New South Wales. In the wild, these fish inhabit shallow, well-oxygenated areas.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The striped squirrelfish has a dorsal spine with eight to 14 dorsal soft rays. The soft rays are orange or yellow and the dorsal spine is vermilion. The snout of this fish is slightly concave.</p><p>The striped squirrelfish has a bright red body with about 10 bright white longitudinal stripes, and a red dorsal fin with the spines tipped with white. There are two diagonal white lines on the head, one that extends below the eye from the corner of the mouth to the base of the gill plate, and one that extends upwards from the base of the gill plate to the top of the eye.</p><p>This fish is often mistaken for its close relative, the crowned or diadem squirrelfish . Having the same two diagonal white lines on the head, what primarily separates the two species is that this particular fish has a deeper ruby-red colored body, the stripes are more of a bluish-white color, and the dorsal fin is black, white, and red.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Because this fish has rough scales and sharp gill spines, it can easily get caught or snagged in aquarium net materials. If this happens it may be difficult to remove the fish from the material without some scale damage occurring. Use caution when handling this and other squirrelfish. The spines can cause a nasty and painful stinging injury.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Squirrelfish are generally a peaceful species of fish and make excellent additions to most marine community aquariums. Squirrelfish may be bullied and will run and hide rather than stand up to an aggressor. They fare well with more robust tank mates. Most mildly predatory fish tend to leave them alone because of their intimidating dorsal spines. They also do best when kept in large groups of six or more. Compatible tankmates for the squirrelfish may include angelfish, anthias, batfish, clownfish, hawkfish, and tangs. Squirrelfish will prey on smaller species of fish and crustaceans.</p><h2>Striped Squirrelfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>The most suitable size of aquarium is dependent upon how many squirrelfish you intend to have. A 50-gallon tank is suitable for a single fish, 75 gallons is good for a small group, and at least 100 gallons is needed for larger groupings.</p><p>Squirrelfish are active swimmers and should have sufficient swimming space. Squirrelfish prefer aquariums with strong water circulation.</p><p>As this fish is a nocturnal animal, it tends to hide in the shadows during daylight hours and comes out at night. If you keep this fish in a brightly lit aquarium, you most likely will not see it very often. To enjoy this fish, keep it in low lighting. You can make your tank into a more interesting display if you create a complete ""nocturnal species tank"" by combining a group of this fish with other non-aggressive nighttime tankmates. This fish was practically unheard of until the advent of ""themed"" aquariums. Once aquarium enthusiasts became enthralled by nocturnal tanks, then squirrelfish became an obvious choice. </p><p>No matter what type of tank this fish is placed in, it requires lots of hiding places. A shelter can be provided with a live rock structure, a decorative rock cave, and crevice-type formations.</p><h2>Striped Squirrelfish Diet </h2><p>In the wild, the Hawaiian squirrelfish is a carnivore that feeds on a variety of crustaceans, such as shrimp and crabs, marine worms, brittle and serpent stars, and other motile invertebrates. At night, they spread out over the reef looking for food.</p><p>In captivity, it can be fed a varied diet of chopped seafood, live or frozen brine and mysid shrimp, as well as invertebrates, and other meaty foods or frozen preparations usually suitable for carnivores. Feed this fish two times a day, especially in the evening with the lights dimmed.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>There are no noticeable differences physically among the genders.</p><h2>Breeding the Striped Squirrelfish </h2><p>There is little information about successfully breeding squirrelfish in the home aquarium. Like many other marine organisms, they reproduce by external fertilization. They are pelagic, or egg scatterers, which means that they let the water column carry the eggs in open waters and do not guard their offspring. </p><h2>Unique Characteristic </h2><p>Squirrelfish are known for their ability to make a variety of clicking and grunting noises, which are produced by vibrating their swim bladders. It is believed that they do this to defend themselves and their territories. For example, some squirrelfish can make different sounds depending on the type of threat that is faced. When facing a fish that is too large to intimidate, the squirrelfish emits a series of clicking noises, signaling the need to retreat from the situation. </p>",889
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/south-american-leaffish-4065312,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>South American Leaffish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>South American Leaffish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The unique South American Leaffish, or Amazon Leaffish, is a very interesting fish for the classroom or for the many aquarium keepers who wants a conversation piece. The South American Leaffish gets its name because it looks remarkably like an actual dead tree leaf. It is, however, a challenging freshwater fish to own, and it can be expensive as well. If you commit to owning one of these remarkable and rare ambush predators, you will need to fully embrace the challenge of a truly unusual fish.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: South American Leaffish, or Amazon Leaffish,</p><p>Adult Size: 3-4 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 8 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The South American Leaffish hails from the Amazon River basin in the countries of Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Columbia, and Venezuela. It lives in shallow water where it hides among the vegetation in the riverbed, facing downward. Hidden from its prey by its surroundings, its camouflaged body, and its transparent fins, these fish are nearly undetectable until they attack.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The South American Leaffish looks extraordinarily like a dead leaf, floating among the vegetation toward the bottom of a tank. Like a leaf, it is small, oval-shaped, and flat from side to side; both its anal and dorsal fins are spiny, creating a body margin of jagged edges, like a perfect leaf outline.</p><p>This fish is yellow to brown with random markings as well as three lines running from the eye to the belly, from the mouth to the caudal fin, and from the eye to the dorsal fin, resembling the veins of the leaf. Many have a quarter-inch-long flap of skin protruding from the lower lip that looks like the stem of a leaf. It has a huge mouth relative to its size.</p><p>So good is its camouflage that even in a net with assorted dead leaves and twigs, it is likely to be returned to the water unseen unless it moves. To complete the deception, the only fins that normally move, the pectorals and the rear tips of the dorsal and anal fins, are transparent and nearly invisible even when in motion.</p><p>An even more impressive aspect of the South American Leaffish is its uncanny ability to alter its camouflage while lying in wait for prey. Like a chameleon, its colors may change in order to blend in more perfectly with its background whether in the wild or in captivity.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>An ambush predator, the leaffish lies in wait of any prey that will fit into its very large mouth. This fish can eat its own weight in live fish every day. Even though it is only about three inches full-grown, it will clean out your entire community aquarium tank in a week if the other fish are smaller than it is.  For this reason, it is best to keep this species on its own. If you do want to include other fish in the tank, choose larger, more robust and aggressive species such as the Armored Catfish or medium-sized loricariids.</p><h2>South American Leaffish Habitat and Care </h2><p>To thrive, the South American Leaffish needs soft water and dim light. Floating plants can help to recreate the fish's natural habitat and keep harsh light from filtering down. Because this fish hunts in ambush and is easily frightened, it also needs plenty of large-leafed plants and driftwood as objects to hide behind. Water filtration in the aquarium should be sufficient to maintain good water quality, but keep the water flow as still as possible.</p><h2>South American Leaffish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Leaffish do well in an aquarium as long as they eat live fish as their main diet. In order for this fish to be kept alive, each fish must be fed the equivalent of at least three adult guppies per day, or they will quickly weaken and die. Guppies are eagerly eaten, but feeding large, live food can be costly. In some places, such as the southern states, there is an abundance of small native fish that can be caught and fed to the Leaffish.</p><p>Leaffish typically swim or hang in the water at an un-fish-like, head-down angle. While this clever rouse gives the three-inch leaffish wonderful protection from larger predatory fish, the main value of the camouflage is as an aid in capturing smaller fish. The leaffish may drift with the current until an unsuspecting smaller fish swims near, or it may sidle ever so slowly up to a fish until its mouth is almost touching. Then it quickly opens its enormous mouth to create a vacuum that sucks the smaller prey inside.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are few differences between males and females, though females will appear more plump during the spawning season. The male also has slightly larger fins.</p><h2>Breeding the South American Leaffish </h2><p>This species is not particularly difficult to breed; the challenge is not so much providing special conditions, as it is the luck of finding a pair that happens to be ready to breed. If they are ready to breed and if there is a broadleaf plant such as an Amazon Sword Plant, females will lay eggs on the underside of the leaf or the underside of an overhanging stone. After the female carefully deposits her eggs, the male fertilizes them. Each egg is attached to the leaf or stone by a short thread. Hence, the large glassy eggs are all raised slightly off the spawning site. The eggs will be tended to closely by both parents and hatch in three to five days.</p><p>The male leaffish stays close to the eggs, carefully fanning water over the eggs. After hatching, the babies remain attached to the spawning site by the egg thread for another week. Once they are free-swimming, baby leaffish act much like their parents, remaining still most of the time. At first, young leaffish eat small aquatic microorganisms, but by the time they have grown to a half-inch, they are able to eat small fish the size of baby guppies or brine shrimp.</p><p>The fry (baby fish) are transparent for about two weeks and will graze on infusoria that exists on mature plants and rocks in the aquarium. After two weeks the fry should be removed and separated since they grow at different speeds; larger fry will eat smaller fry as soon as they can fit the smaller fry into their mouths.</p><p>Leaffish fry must be fed plenty of daphnia, mosquito larva, brine shrimp and if available, guppy fry for fastest growth. The fry are covered with white specks up until about two months of age. They appear to have an Ich infection, but this is just natural coloring for a fry of this age. After two to three months, the fry will obtain adult coloration and be ready to eat larger fish. At this point, they must be separated further by size.</p>",1105

Snowflake moray eels can get large, up to 2 feet long in captivity, and are very good at escaping from the tank. A large tank with a tight-fitting hood with no possible escape points is a necessity.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Snowflake moray, Bosch's eel, clouded moray eel, floral eel, starry eel, white and zebra moray eel</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 24 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5-15 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The snowflake eel inhabits caves and crevices throughout the Indo-Pacific reefs from Hawaii southward to Australia, westward through the islands of the Indo-Pacific to the East Indies, and across the Indian Ocean to the coast of Africa.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Snowflake eels have an ornamental pattern that resembles many different snowflakes across the body. Its body is white or cream-colored with black dendritic or teethlike black blotches that contain one or two yellow spots. The eyes of the snowflake moray eel are yellow and there are yellow markings on the head. The teeth of this moray are perfect for crustacean prey. The conical teeth of the snowflake moray eel are good for crushing invertebrate exoskeletons. Larger snowflake moray eels tend to eat more fish in the wild.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Compatible tankmates for the snowflake moray eel include other relatively large, aggressive fish, such as lionfish, tangs, triggerfish, wrasses, and possibly even other snowflake moray eels if they are both introduced to the tank at the same time.</p><p>Although considered to be less aggressive than other saltwater morays, the snowflake eel can become very pugnacious at feeding time. With poor eyesight but a keen sense of smell, when food is detected it emerges from hiding and aggressively searches it out. This moray is best kept with fish larger in size than the eel to discourage predation and can live communally with other eels if plenty of room and shelter is provided.</p><p>Snowflake moray eels are not safe to keep with shrimp, crabs, or lobsters since crustaceans are their natural diet. However, they are safe to keep with most other invertebrates, including starfish, anemones, and sea urchins. Snowflake morays are reef safe and will not bother corals, though these eels are messy eaters and will require strong filtration and a relatively large protein skimmer for the long-term health of any corals housed in their aquarium. The moray eel will likely consume very small fish such as damselfish. </p><h2>Snowflake Eel Habitat and Care </h2><p>A snowflake eel can outgrow a small aquarium in a rather short period of time, so get a large tank of at least 50 gallons per eel from the onset. The snowflake eel generally adapts well to aquarium conditions and is disease-resistant.</p><p>The snowflake moray eel can often be a bit shy during the first few weeks in a new aquarium. Provide it with many places to hide, and ample room to move around. Equip the tank with at least one suitably sized cave. If possible, provide it with several caves and decorate in such a way that it is possible for it to move from one side of the aquarium to the other without being exposed. Due to this eel's size and strength, rock formations should be stacked firmly to prevent structures from becoming dislodged.</p><p>This is a very hardy eel, but an escape artist; a tightly-fitting canopy is ideal. Most of the eels that do die (or get lost) in hobbyist aquariums fell victim to poorly sealed tanks. The snowflake moray eel has the ability to find and crawl out of the smallest hole in the aquarium top, so make sure all of these holes are well-covered. They can slide out and may make their way through PVC plumbing into filter bags or the aquarium sump.</p><h2>Snowflake Eel Diet </h2><p>The wild snowflake eel is a carnivorous, nocturnal predator, ambushing fish and crustaceans. In the tank, it will take frozen or freeze-dried krill, fish, shrimp, clams, squid, octopus, scallops, feeder fish, and most meaty foods enriched with vitamins. It can be taught to hand feed, although this should be done with caution, as it can inflict a painful bite. Unless already acclimated to frozen foods, the moray eel will likely need to be fed with live ghost shrimp when first acquired. Weaning can be accomplished over time. The feeding of freshwater feeder fish (like goldfish and rosy reds) may cause liver disease if fed excessively, so such food items should be limited.</p><p>A snowflake eel usually ignores other tank inhabitants if it is well fed, at least several times a week. It is not uncommon for eels to go into a ""hibernation"" period, often hiding and not eating for several weeks or longer.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>There is no noticeable difference between the sexes. Keeping multiple eels is typically more of a challenge than a breeder will want to deal with. Snowflake eels are protogynous, meaning the more dominant eel will change from female to male. Again this brings more issues, as eels are generally peaceful toward one another. Gender changing can take several months to a year, which is far longer than most breeders are willing to wait. </p><h2>Breeding the Snowflake Eel </h2><p>Snowflake eels are egg scatterers that produce eggs often in midwater mating rituals. Their eggs and larvae drift with plankton in the water column and settle back onto a reef at about the time of hatching. Snowflake eels are among the most challenging types of marine fish to propagate in captivity.</p>",899

They have a distinctive black bar across both sides, giving them their ""skunk"" moniker. These fish make a good addition to many aquariums and will often be seen foraging around in soft substrate.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Skunk Cory Cat, Arched Corydoras</p><p>Adult Size: 2 to 2.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 8 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Skunk Cory is native to the upper Amazon River basin in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. This area has a lot of active whitewater, which this species of cory cat appreciates with its faster moving current.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>As you may imagine, the Skunk Cory gets its name from it's distinctive black and white coloration. The main body and fins of the Skunk Cory are white to almost translucent, with a bold black stripe that runs along both sides of the dorsal ridge from the mouth to the tail. The eyes are often black and fall within the stiped portion of the body.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Like many other corydoras, the Skunk Cory is very peaceful and gets along with many other communal fish. Being a bottom dweller, they do not take up mid-tank swimming space. They can be easily bullied, so be sure that they have lots of places to hide among plants or rocks on the bottom of their aquarium. Here are some good tankmates for the Skunk Cory: Plecostomus, Zebra Danio, White Cloud Mountain Minnow, and small schooling fish.</p><h2>Skunk Cory Habitat and Care </h2><p>Your Skunk Cory will spend most of its time on the bottom of their tank, so the substrate should be fairly smooth. It is recommended to use sand or smaller gravel for these fish. This will allow them to easily root around in the substrate while looking for tasty bits leftover from feedings. You should expect your cory to spend most of their day foraging, so be sure to have lots of room for them to explore.</p><p>Live aquatic plants work well with Skunk Corys, as they will not dig up roots or voraciously eat plants. It is best to chose taller live plants so they do not interfere with the Skunk Cory's bottom activity. Lots of low, dense plants can entangle bottom dwelling fish, like the Skunk Cory.</p><h2>Skunk Cory Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Skunk Corys are omnivores and will be busy cleaning up all the leftover bits from other fish higher up in the water column. However, this doesn't mean that they shouldn't get any special foods for themselves! Provide your Skunk Cory with a high quality tropical pellet. Flakes will be mostly eaten by other fish before they reach the bottom of your tank. You can certainly provide occasional treats such as veggies or frozen diets, but most of their diet should be a sinking pellet.</p><p>You should feed your Skunk Cory at least once a day. If your aquarium water temperature is above 72 to 74F (22 to 23 C), you can increase this to twice a day.</p><p>Be sure to pay attention to all your fish during feeding time! Make sure enough food gets down to your corys at the bottom of the tank. Often, you will see your Skunk Cory swim up to the surface during feeding time, but if you have more aggressive eaters in the water column above, it may be very hard for your cory to get enough to eat. If they are struggling, you can send sinking pellets down a straw, directly into the mouths of your hungry bottom dwellers.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>It can be very difficult to tell male vs. female Skunk Corys. In general, females tend to be larger with rounder bodies, but this can be very hard to determine if you only have one fish. Unless you want to breed your Skunk Corys, it really doesn't matter if you have males or females since they are not aggressive fish.</p><h2>Breeding the Skunk Cory </h2><p>As with most fish, providing the correct diet and habitat goes a long way in successful breeding practices. Reproductively active fish will require more protein and fat in the diet to produce robust eggs. The female Skunk Cory will hold two to four eggs between her pelvic fins, where the male fertilizes them for about 30 seconds. Only then the female swims to a suitable spot, where she attaches the very sticky eggs. The pair repeats this process until about 100 eggs have been fertilized and attached. The eggs will hatch within a few days provided they are not eaten by other fish in the aquarium. When breeding any fish, it is recommended to have your fish spawn in a separate breeding tank in order to preserve as many viable offspring as possible.</p>",790

A fairly aggressive fish, especially towards some invertebrate species and other fishes, the Six Line Wrasse requires careful consideration before adding them to your aquarium. Once established, they are relatively easy to keep, although breeding them is exceedingly difficult.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Six Line Wrasse, Six Stripe Wrasse, Six Bar Wrasse</p><p>Adult Size: 3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 to 6 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Many of the Six Line Wrasses in the aquarium hobby are live-caught from the coast of Fiji and other Indo-Pacific locations. They are found on coral reefs in shallow, clear, and warm water. They spend their days foraging in the cracks and crevices of reefs, looking for small prey animals to eat.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Six Line Wrasse, as you can discern from its name, has six lines lengthwise along its body. Their bodies are blue to pink with bright red to orange bands. Their tails are green to yellow and they are distinguished by a false eye spot on their dorsal tail peduncle. This false eye spot is used to trick predators to attack the back end of the fish, allowing it to escape if attacked.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The Six Line Wrasse is typically reef safe and does not nip at corals. They are known to prey on crustaceans, snails, and clams. They are aggressive towards other fish, particularly other smaller, peaceful wrasses. As with all aggressive fish, it is best to add them to an aquarium last, after all the other fish have had time to settle in. Aggression may be apparent over food, space or other resources, so be sure to have enough space for all your intended species and spread food around the aquarium to reduce competition. It is recommended to only have one Six Line Wrasse per aquarium to limit aggression, unless you are planning on breeding them.</p><p>Some potential tankmates for the Six Line Wrasse include larger, semi-aggressive wrasse species, such as the banana wrasse and dragon wrasse. Please keep in mind that these species will need considerably more space, given their large size and personalities.</p><h2>Six Line Wrasse Habitat and Care </h2><p>Once established, the Six Line Wrasse is relatively easy to care for. They will be seen foraging between cracks and crevices in the substrate and live rock, mainly keeping to themselves. Be sure to provide a rich environment with many places to explore to keep your wrasse out of trouble with its tankmates.</p><p>They are known to eat snails, urchins, and flatworms, so may have some benefits for your overall system environment. Try to limit the number of ""cleaner"" fish in an aquarium with a Six Line Wrasse in order to prevent injury or death from these aggressive fish.</p><h2>Six Line Wrasse Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The Six Line Wrasse is primarily a carnivorous fish, eating mostly animal proteins. They are natural foragers and will nibble at small invertebrates in your aquarium.</p><p>They are best fed a carnivorous pelleted diet and supplement with meaty treats. Pelleted diets contain the best source of required vitamins. Meaty treats may include mysis, brine shrimp, and other carnivorous frozen diets.</p><p>Being tropical fish, they should be fed at least twice a day, or smaller meals three times a day.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male and female Six Line Wrasses have no externally distinguishable sex characteristics. Some owners have noted that their fish may become more vibrantly colored just prior to spawning, but this is not guaranteed. Males are noted to turn brighter colors than females.</p><h2>Breeding the Six Line Wrasse </h2><p>Unless you have a pair of Six Line Wrasses that have already mated, it is almost impossible to determine gender of the fish prior to purchase. Given their aggressive nature, most Six Line Wrasses are kept individually, therefore will not be given the option for reproduction.</p><p>Like many other fish species, the Six Line Wrasse is a broadcast spawner. This means that eggs and sperm are haphazardly sprayed throughout the water, rather than concentrating their eggs in a clutch or cave. Many spawnings happen without hobbyists even noticing, since most of the reproductive products will end up in your filtration system.</p>",696
42,https://www.thesprucepets.com/silver-dollar-1381267,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Silver Dollar Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Silver Dollar Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>Looking at the round, flat, and shimmering silver dollar, it is easy to see how this fish acquired the name. Although many specimens seen in shops are scarcely larger than the size of a shiny dime, don't be fooled. Adults become much larger than their namesake, growing to nearly a half foot across.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Silver dollar</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 6 inches (16 cm)</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p> originates in the Tapajós River Basin in Brazil but is widespread in shallower tributaries and river systems across northern South America. It is only one of a dozen different species known in the aquarium trade as the ""silver dollar."" and are all species regularly seen for sale in the aquarium industry.</p><p>Generally considered the archetypal silver dollar, is often confused with  which is similar in appearance. can sometimes be distinguished from other species by their small dots on their sides.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p> silver dollars are generally a shiny silver over the entire body, but with a slight green or blue tint in the right light. In healthy habitats, they will have small tinted dots on their sides. Hints of red will also appear, especially on the anal fin of the male, which is edged in red.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Silver dollars are a schooling fish by nature and do best when kept in schools of six or more. A very peaceful shoaling species, they do not do well on their own, but even a large group will be skittish and timid when left without shelter.</p><p>They are peaceful enough to be trusted with much smaller fish than themselves, and yet they are robust enough to handle the company of much larger species. Peaceful large catfish such as plecos and doradids would be a good choice, as would many non-aggressive cichlids.</p><h2>Silver Dollar Habitat and Care </h2><p>Silver dollars are hardy and easy to care for. Although this fish is fairly durable, the aquarist must maintain a very large tank for them. A school or six or more will require an aquarium of 75 gallons or larger. Silver dollars prefer subdued lighting, dark substrate, plenty of room to move about, as well as many good hiding places.</p><p>It's advisable to use plastic plants or very sturdy live plants because they will eat most live plants. They do best in soft moderately acidic water, although they're not fussy about water conditions. Silver dollars are not overly demanding about water quality, though they do best in clean and clear, well-aerated, and well-filtered moving water.</p><h2>Silver Dollar Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Interestingly, silver dollars are in the same family as piranhas, but instead of being carnivores, they are almost exclusively vegetarian. Their favored foods include vegetable flakes such as spirulina, and leafy greens such as lettuce, watercress, and cooked romaine or spinach. They will also eat cooked vegetables such as peas and squash. When feeding any fresh food, take extra care to remove any uneaten portions promptly, as their decay will foul the water.</p><p>Even though the silver dollar prefers a vegetarian diet, they will also eat meaty foods as treats. They are especially fond of bloodworms, mosquito larvae (glass worms), and brine shrimp. If the silver dollars are in a community tank, watch them at feeding time to ensure that more active and aggressive fish don't get the bulk of the food. Some silver dollar individuals can be rather timid in the crowd and can end up underfed as a result. The use of feeding rings will likely mitigate this issue.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males have a longer anal fin that is tinged with red on its front. During courtship and breeding, the male will also develop two large black spots that are vertically arranged just behind the base of the pectoral fins. The red color on the male fins gets richer and black borders appear. Some male specimens will also display other dark marbling on the body. Females show little, if any, variation in color during courtship and breeding.</p><h2>Breeding the Silver Dollar </h2><p>Silver dollars are easy to breed. They will occasionally spawn without assistance in a large well-suited aquarium. To create breeding pairs, start with a half-dozen or more juveniles and raise them to maturity together. They will reach breeding age at about one year of age and about four inches in length. To optimize breeding success, it's best to condition the males and females in separate tanks prior to breeding. For seven to 10 days, feed them a high-quality plant and vegetable diet with some meaty treats.</p><p>They are naturally group spawners but they can also be bred in known pairs. Breeding pairs should be removed from their school and transferred into a breeding tank. Although the parents will not consume their own eggs or fry, other fish will, so when spawning, place them in a separate tank.</p><p>To facilitate spawning, make sure the water is soft (8 dgH or below) and warm (80 to 82 F). Keep the lighting dim, and provide fine-leafed plants; these will be eaten if they are live rather than plastic plants. When ready to spawn, the males will darken, especially around the anal, caudal, and dorsal fins, and their hints of red will intensify.</p><p>Eventually, a pair will spawn and the female will lay up to 2,000 eggs. The eggs will fall to the bottom of the tank where they will hatch in three days; they will not be bothered by their vegetarian parents. After approximately a week, the fry will be free swimming and able to eat fine foods such as commercially prepared fry food, finely crushed spirulina, or freshly hatched brine shrimp.</p>",920
117,https://www.thesprucepets.com/arowana-fish-species-profile-5077431,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Silver Arowana Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Silver Arowana Fish Species Profile</h1><p>Intro</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Silver Arowana</p><p>Adult Size: 3-4 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10-20 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Silver Arowana is a freshwater fish of the ancient ray-finned fishes, the Actinopterygii. There are many families of Arowana, originating from South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. The Silver Arowana (diverged from their Asian and Australian cousins ( spp.) during the Jurassic period.</p><p>In the pet trade, there are 10 varieties of arowana that are classified by their origin. Arowanas of the species (Asian bonytongue aka Green Arowana) and (Myanmar bonytongue aka Scripted Arowana) are endangered and listed as CITES level I, requiring a special permit to keep and are threatened with extinction in their native habitats, although they are bred in captivity in Asia and often kept as aquarium pets there.</p><p>Some arowanas can be very expensive pet fish. There are reports of some varieties selling for over $100,000 per fish. There are some states that do not allow the shipment of Arowana due to its potential threat to native species if it were to be released.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The various Arowana varieties are commonly classified by their origin and coloration. The common Silver Arowana is a pale silver to gold. Juveniles may have a blue tint and a yellow-orange bar along their side. Other species may be tinted red or green, depending on their species.</p><p>All arowana have very large scales with a pair of barbels on their lower jaw. The dorsal and anal fins are almost fused with the tail, giving the fish a streamlined appearance.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>No matter what species, arowanas are solitary fish. Unless you have a large aquarium system and are planning on breeding arowana, only one fish is recommended.</p><p>Unfortunately, some arowana are very picky eaters and refuse to eat anything other than live feeds. Try to avoid this if you can. Keep in mind that any live fish or invertebrates entering the aquarium should be quarantined prior to being fed to prevent introduction of pathogens into your aquarium. If your arowana decides not to eat the live feed at that time, you may need to consider long term care of those feeder fish in another aquarium.</p><h2>Arowana Habitat and Care </h2><p>Arowana can grow exceptionally large, even though they start deceptively small. You will require at least 300 gallons per fish. It is recommended to go bigger if you can and make sure you have a solid lid. In the wild, arowana are used to jumping out of the water for their food, so they may try to unwillingly escape if they see a bright light or a reflection on the top of their tank. A wider, shallower tank will prevent your fish from getting too much momentum towards the surface. Some owners will have a collar of plexiglass or netting around the top of their tank with a side door in order to access the water surface. This will allow your fish to hunt naturally while not flying out of the aquarium!</p><p>Keep your arowana tank free of obstructions. They are quick to charge their food and may be hindered by lots of decor items. Do not expect live plants to do well in arowana tanks without fertilizer supplementation since there is only one fish in a large volume of water, unable to produce adequate levels of nitrate.</p><h2>Arowana Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Arowanas are on the carnivorous fish feeding spectrum. Their wild counterparts are known for grabbing prey off the surface of the water, a hard lifestyle to replicate in an artificial environment. If possible, allow your fish to hunt their meals at the surface. See above section for creating a safety or access zone above your aquarium.</p><p>It is best to feed your arowana a pelleted diet with meaty supplements, such as krill and shrimp. Do not introduce live feeds if your fish is willing to eat a pelleted diet. Many hobbyists have made this mistake and the fish will refuse to go back to the pelleted diet. It may be ""fun"" or ""natural"" for your fish to hunt wild prey, but it could potentially be bringing in disease and is certainly not a fun experience for the intended prey.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are no external differences between male and female arowana. This is one of the biggest challenges when attempting to breed these fish. It is thought that the male mouth might be slightly larger with fish of the same age and size, but this has not been verified.</p><h2>Breeding the Arowana </h2><p>Arowana are mouth brooding fish, wherein the male will carry the unhatched eggs in his mouth. During this time, the males will not eat. They will carry the eggs for 50-60 days until the eggs hatch into fry.</p>",779

They are very similar to the standard Comet goldfish except for their distinctive calico coloration and elongated fins. The Shubunkin makes a great addition to many goldfish and temperate fish tanks.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Shubunkin goldfish, Speckled goldfish, Harlequin goldfish</p><p>Adult Size: 12 to 14 inches (including long tail fin)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 30 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Shubunkin is a breed of long-bodied, fancy goldfish. They originated in Japan through several generations of cross breeding the standard (short fin) and Comet (long fin) goldfish with calico telescope goldfish. They are not found in the wild since they were cultivated through human manipulation. Their ancestor, the Crucian carp, is found throughout Europe and Asia.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Shubunkin is distinctive from the Comet goldfish in their coloration and more elongated fins. With Comet goldfish varying between white, brown, gold, yellow and red, the Shubunkin is distinguished by its ""calico"" markings. These fish have a pale white to iridescent body with overlying black or blue markings, splashed with reds and yellows. The Shubunkin has a very recognizable appearance when mixed with other goldfish species. Some other varieties of goldfish can be crossed with Shubunkins to have fancy goldfish body types with Shubunkin coloration.</p><p>Some Shubunkins may have very clear scales or patches of skin that are scaleless, like their doitsu koi cousins. All of their fins are slightly longer than Comet goldfish. The fins will often contain streaks of black to match their body markings.</p><h2>Tankmates</h2><p>The Shubunkin can have tankmates similar to the Comet goldfish. Being temperate fish, they should not be mixed with any tropical species of fish. Shubunkins are very social fish and not aggressive to other fish. They are voracious eaters, so anything small enough to fit in their mouth can be mistakenly eaten, including small fish and invertebrates.</p><h2>Shubunkin Habitat and Care </h2><p>Like all other goldfish, your Shubunkins will require a tank with a filter, not a bowl. They do not require heated water and do well at room temperature. Shubunkins will make a lot of waste, and you will need to keep a close eye on your tank's nitrogen cycle levels to ensure your nitrate stays below 20 mg/L. Be sure your aquarium has strong filtration.</p><p>Shubunkins are not very picky about their décor. As long as their tank is large enough, they will be active fish and swim constantly. Try not to add too many obstacles, since this may tear longer fins.</p><p>Goldfish are active foragers and will often be seen picking up their substrate and spitting it back out. This is a normal behavior for goldfish and you should not be too concerned about something getting stuck in their mouths. The biggest concern for an oral foreign body are the gel balls containing beneficial bacteria. These can easily get stuck and cause your fish to stop eating. If your fish has an oral foreign body, call your aquatic veterinarian immediately.</p><h2>Shubunkin Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Shubunkins are omnivores and can eat commercially available goldfish foods. Stick to a pelleted diet around 32-35% protein and 5-7% fat. Goldfish are not vegetarians and need some animal protein sources for correct development. Reproductively-active and juvenile fish will need increased protein and fat.</p><p>Feed your goldfish for 3-5 minutes once a day if the temperature is at or below 70F (21C). Above 70F, you will need to feed your goldfish twice a day. Being ectotherms with a wide temperature tolerance, the warmer the water temperature, the hungrier your Shubunkins will be. Do not let uneaten food accumulate in the aquarium.</p><p>You can feed your Shubunkins occasional treats. Veggies, such as shelled green peas, can be fed up to once a day as a treat. Meaty treats, such as frozen bloodworms or brine shrimp, should be fed no more than once a week.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Unlike the Comet goldfish, not all male Shubunkins will exhibit the classic breeding tubercles on the pectoral fins and sides of the operculum. Females will have rounder bellies than males, but only if reproductively active. It is very hard to distinguish males from females in fish that are not preparing to spawning.</p><h2>Breeding the Shubunkin </h2><p>With the correct cues in temperature and light and a supportive diet, even beginners can easily breed their Shubunkins. The males will often be seen chasing the females around the tank in order to get them to release their eggs. Following behind, the males will externally fertilize the eggs which will settle throughout your tank. Often, goldfish will concentrate their breeding efforts on plant material with exposed roots to catch the eggs.</p><p>After your fish have spawned, it is critical to remove the adult fish from the aquarium so they do not eat their eggs. This can be easily accomplished by setting up a special spawning tank and then removing the adults to their main tank afterwards. One spawning can produce up to 1000 eggs. Fry will emerge from their eggs in about 6 days and start swimming and eating. Be sure to feed them an appropriate diet for good development.</p>",847

They're quite popular in a community aquarium because of their beauty and ease of care, though they can become mildly aggressive when among slow-moving species. Add a school of six or more serpae tetras to your aquarium along with plants, rocks, and caves to keep them interested, and enjoy watching as they explore.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Blood characin, callistus, callistus tetra, jewel tetra, red minor tetra, red serpae, serpa tetra, serpae tetra</p><p>Adult Size: 1.75 inches (4.5 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Care</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Serpae tetras originate in the Amazon basin, inhabiting the Guaporé and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Brazil, and upper Paraguay. Most specimens currently sold in the aquarium trade are captive bred rather than wild-caught; the species is not endangered. In the wild, this species prefers still and slow-moving backwaters such as lakes, ponds, and streams. They often congregate around tree roots and thick vegetation where they can find both safety and food.</p><p>This species is part of a group known as the blood tetras, referring to their red coloration. Considerable confusion and debate have continued over species within this group, as they have strong similarities. Serpaes are very similar to, but not identical with,  also called the red phantom tetra</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The deep red color of the serpae tetra adds to its popularity. The body of the serpae is flat and tall. A black comma-shaped spot is present just behind the gills. The dorsal fin, edged with white, is predominantly black, and all other fins are red. The anal fin is edged in black with a splash of white at the leading tip. These colors fade as the fish ages, particularly the spot behind the gills. Females are plumper and less brilliantly colored than their male counterparts. In captivity, long-finned variations have been produced.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The serpae tetra is generally considered a peaceful fish and should always be kept in schools of a half dozen or more. However, in smaller groups, they have been known to nip fins, an aggression that is most often directed at its own kind, especially during feeding times.</p><p>Ideal tankmates include other active fish of similar or larger size, such as barbs, danios, and larger tetras. Bottom-dwelling catfish and loaches are also suitable tankmates. Avoid keeping this species with fish that have long, flowing fins or that are slow-moving, such as angelfish or bettas. Also, avoid keeping them with smaller species of fish as they may get harassed. Serpae tetras are most likely to show aggression at feeding time; place food at several locations or use multiple feeding rings to help reduce nipping at feeding time.</p><h2>Serpae Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>The serpae tetra is most at home in an Amazon habitat. In nature, this fish is accustomed to quiet waters with roots and organic debris. Using peat or blackwater extract helps mimic this type of soft, acid water.</p><p>A dark-colored substrate is best, with somewhat subdued lighting. Leave an open swimming space with driftwood, plants, and décor around the edges to provide hiding places. Keep the water movement slow within the tank. Though serpae tetras are easy to care for, they are not recommended for a newly set-up tank, as they are sensitive to changes in water parameters.</p><h2>Serpae Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In their natural environment, serpae tetras eat small live foods such as insects, invertebrates, and worms. In the aquarium, they will accept virtually any food quite readily, including flake, pellet, freeze-dried, and frozen foods. To keep them in prime condition and bring out their colors, feed a good variety of food types, including live foods when available.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Differences between the sexes are slight and most apparent when serpaes are ready to spawn. Males are more brightly colored and slimmer, and the dorsal fin is fully black. In females, the dorsal fin is paler. Females are also fuller in the body, even when not spawning.</p><h2>Breeding the Serpae Tetra </h2><p>Serpae tetras are relatively easy to breed as pairs or in groups of roughly an equal number of males and females. The key to successful breeding is to set up a tank with the proper habitat for spawning and subsequent grow-out of the fry.</p><p>Set up a small tank with dark-colored substrate, very dim lighting, and spawning mops or fine-leaved plants, such as java moss or Myriophyllum. The water should be very soft, no more than 6 to 8 dGH, and pH approximately 6.0. Provide gentle filtration, such as an air-driven sponge filter. Keep the water around 80 F (27 C).</p><p>Condition the spawning pair with a variety of foods, including live foods if possible. Males will become more colorful and females will become noticeably plump when ready to spawn. Eggs will be scattered over the plants or spawning mop. Once the eggs have been laid, remove the adults as they will consume the eggs. Turn off all lighting in the tank, since the eggs are highly sensitive to light.</p><p>In one to two days the eggs will hatch, after which they will feed on their yolk sack for several days. Once they are free swimming, they will feed on infusoria and freshly hatched brine shrimp. You can also provide finely crushed flake foods or commercially-prepared fry food in lieu of brine shrimp.</p>",882

The distinct bar pattern on the tail fin accentuates the scissor-like shape. This active fish cuts through the water, and when swimming and even while at rest, this fish will open and close its tail in a scissor-like fashion, giving rise to the common name for which it's best known. The scissortail rasbora has a silver iridescence that shimmers and sparkles as it reflects ambient light.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Black scissortail, scissorfish, scissortail, scissortail rasbora, scissortail shark, spot-tail rasbora, three-lined rasbora</p><p>Adult Size: 3.5 inches (8 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>, commonly know as the scissortail rasbora, originates from the southern Mekong River basin in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, as well as from the Malaysian peninsula and the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Most often found in slow-flowing rivers and swamps in forested areas, scissortails have also been found in rapidly flowing hillside streams as well as lakes and reservoirs. Most specimens sold in the aquarium trade are captive bred rather than wild-caught.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Also known as the three-lined rasbora, this fish is a hardy and popular member of the Rasbora group. Slender, with an almost transparent body, a horizontal black line runs from behind the gills to the tail. The tail is forked, and bears bands of yellow and black, ending with a band of white at the tip, giving its common name of the three-lined rasbora. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Preferring to live in schools of a half dozen or more, the scissortail grouping is quite active. They are peaceful, gregarious fish that do well in community aquariums. They should be kept with at least a half-dozen of its own kind, to bring out their colors and make them feel at home. Other species of rasboras make excellent companions for scissortails.</p><p>Virtually all tetra species are good tankmates, as well as danios, gouramis, and even some larger fish such as the angelfish and discus. Bottom-dwelling fish such as corys and other catfish species also make good tankmates. Even livebearing fish such as guppies, mollies, and swordtails can be kept with scissortails. Just keep in mind that some of those species do better in more alkaline water versus the slightly more acidic water that the scissortails prefer.</p><h2>Scissortail Rasbora Habitat and Care </h2><p>Scissortail rasboras require an open swimming area and do best in longer tanks. Although not fussy about décor, the most natural setting would be one that includes plants such as Java moss, driftwood, and rocks of various sizes to mimic a riverbed habitat. Subdued lighting will recreate the typical forested habitat, however, scissortails will adapt to a wide range of habitats.</p><p>When preparing a tank, filtration is important, as scissortails require good quality water. They are naturally accustomed to moving water and would enjoy a current such as that provided by a powerhead. The use of peat or blackwater additives can help replicate the optimum water parameters. A darker substrate is preferred, and the tank should be tightly covered, as scissortails are prone to jumping.</p><p>When finally bringing this species home, it is wise to match water parameters from the tank they came from, as closely as possible, as they do not adapt well to sudden changes in water conditions. Take care to acclimate them for a few hours to ensure they are not shocked.</p><h2>Scissortail Rasbora Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Scissortails readily accept all foods but prefer to eat live foods whenever possible. In nature, their diet consists primarily of insects. However, they will accept frozen foods and freeze-dried foods as well as flake foods. Brine shrimp, daphnia, and any type of worm are excellent supplemental foods, particularly when conditioning before breeding.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Sexual differences in scissortails are not readily discernible. Males are typically smaller and more slender than females. When ready to spawn, males are more intensely colored. Females are generally larger and rounder in the belly, particularly when viewed from above.</p><h2>Breeding the Scissortail Rasbora  </h2><p>Scissortails are egg-scatterers that are relatively easy to breed. A separate breeding tank is recommended; it should be fitted with either a mesh for the eggs to fall through or spawning mats. Fill the tank about half full of water that is slightly acidic (6.0 to 6.5) and at a temperature of 77 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 28 Celsius). Lighting should be minimal, and it is best to use a sponge type filter.</p><p>Condition adults with live foods, such as bloodworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp to prepare for spawning. When the female is full of eggs, place a few pairs in the breeding tank. To induce spawning, add small amounts of colder, softer water several times throughout the course of the day. Continue feeding live, or frozen live foods, until spawning takes place.</p><p>The breeding pair will make several deposits of adhesive eggs over the spawning medium. Once eggs have been laid, the adults should be removed promptly, as they will readily eat their own eggs. The eggs are sensitive to light and fungus, so lighting should be minimal, and the tank should be kept very clean. Frequent water changes are recommended as well as the use of antifungal treatment in the water as a preventative measure.</p><p>After approximately 24 hours, the eggs will hatch; fry initially feed off the egg sac. After another two days, the fry become free-swimming and must be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp and other small fry foods.</p>",902

All barbs are members of the subfamily Barbinae, with family members found in Europe, Asia, and (according to some sources) Africa. Barbs come in many sizes and colors, though they all share a common shape. Rosy Barbs are well known to aquarists as one of the hardiest and best of the egg-layers for beginners.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Rosy barb, red barb</p><p>Adult Size: 4 to 6 inches (often smaller in captivity)</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution  </h2><p>The rosy barb was first described in 1822. They are generally found in flowing streams, tributaries, lakes, ponds, and even swamps in India. Other wild populations can be found in Singapore, Australia, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. They are numerous and widespread and not considered to be threatened or endangered. </p><p>The popular name ""rosy barb"" was derived from the fact that at spawning time, a rosy color covers the lower part of the sides of the male. Many derivations of the wild rosy barb have been developed over the years through selective breeding. In many strains of farm-raised rosy barbs, the males are rosy almost all the time. Another variety has beautiful, long, flowing fins and tail, and the male of that strain is almost completely rosy red.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Like all barbs, the rosy barb has a long, oval-shaped body, a forked tail, and two dorsal fins. Both sexes are ornamented with a large black spot faintly outlined in brown near the base of the tail. Also, look for black spots along the fins on both males and females. Some (especially those from West Bengal) have more intense coloration as well as reflective scales.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Rosy barbs require colder water, so tankmates should also be able to tolerate temperatures around 75 degrees Fahrenheit. They are semi-aggressive, especially with tankmates that are slow-moving. Large groups of six or more Rosy Barbs do well together, and they get along well with energetic tank mates.</p><h2>Rosy Barb Habitat and Care </h2><p>Rosy Barbs prefer a tank with a soft, sandy bottom, plenty of plants, and a good deal of swimming room. Their natural habitats include wood and rock, so driftwood or similar items will help make them feel at home.</p><p>Because rosy barbs are schooling fish, they need enough space to move through the tank as a group. Providing space is not only good for your pets' well-being; it also ensures that they will be less aggressive toward other species, and they will also be much more interesting to watch.</p><p>It's important to be sure your tank receives at least a few hours of sunlight per day. This is beneficial for the health of the fish, and this reflected light also makes them appear even more beautiful. You will also need a good filter and water movement to ensure that they achieve their best coloration.</p><h2>Rosy Barb Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Rosy barbs are omnivores that need a good variety of foods. These fish should be given a variety in order to maintain a healthy immune system. Include both vegetables and meats.</p><p>Offer quality flake food as well as live and frozen foods such as brine shrimp, bloodworms, and beef heart. They will quickly gobble up small aquatic invertebrates and even cooked vegetables.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>As is the case with many fish, the male rosy barb wears the brightest colors. In this species, males also show their best colors when housed together. His back is a greenish-gray, blending into silver at the sides. The first indications of gender in young fish are that the males develop a black area in the dorsal fin.</p><p>Now and then, when male rosy barbs are kept together, they perform rival displays. Head to tail, they gyrate around and around until the viewer is treated to something that compares to a fireworks show in colors. During this spinning, fins are fully extended, and their coloring is at its strongest.</p><p>Adult female rosy barbs are yellowish-pink and have greenish backs, while males are redder on the underbelly and sides. The younger female is olive-brown all over. </p><h2>Breeding the Rosy Barb </h2><p>Breeding is relatively easy, from an age of about 12 months. The water in a breeding tank should be soft to medium-hard at about 77 F, with a pH of 6.5 to 7.2. The tank need not be larger than a 10-gallon, provided it has filtration, a substrate of sand, an area of open water, and a clump or two of live plants or a hanging clump of nylon wool. Introduce the female first to acclimate, then add the male a few days later.</p><p>Very often, spawning takes place the following morning, with the fish coming together flank to flank. The male wraps his body and fins around the female. Spawning lasts for about two hours; when completed, remove both fish to prevent them from eating their eggs. Eggs hatch in about 24 to 48 hours. </p><p>Start feeding the fry when they are free-swimming. Give infusoria for one to two weeks, adding baby brine shrimp and fine dry fry food after a week. Keep the filtration shut off until the end of the second week, then use a sponge filter till the fry are a 1/2 inch long.</p><p>By the end of the third week, the fry will be strong swimmers. They will eat almost anything offered, and grow very quickly. As with all barbs, feed your rosy barbs a varied diet of live and dry food, as available.</p><p>In nature, a mature rosy barb can grow to 5 or 6 inches long. But when the species was adapted and bred for the aquarium, the fish adapted to a length of 2 to 2 1/2 inches, and they grow true to this maximum length, whether bred at home or in the larger volume tanks on a fish farm.</p>",966
37,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rosy-barb-1378467,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Rosy Barb (Red Barb) Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Rosy Barb (Red Barb) Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>For many reasons, rosy barbs are one of the most popular and readily available fish for aquarium hobbyists. They are an active fish with a peaceful temperament and bright color. The rosy barb is one of the larger members of the barb species, and it can grow up to six inches in the wild. This fish enjoys company, and if its school is large enough, it will not bother other fish in the aquarium. Rosy barbs make great additions to an aquarium and also do well in ponds in warm weather.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Red barb, rosy barb</p><p>Adult Size: 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Rosy barbs originate in northern India, in the states of West Bengal and Assam. Feral populations are also found in Singapore, Australia, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. Rosy barbs natively live in lakes and fast-flowing water in subtropical climates.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Males have a brighter red coloration as opposed to the females that look more gold or silver than red. Both genders have black markings on the fins and sides. The rosy barb has a torpedo-shaped body and a forked tail. It has only one dorsal fin. Like other cyprinid fish, rosy barbs lack an adipose fin.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Ideally, house no fewer than five rosy barbs in an aquarium as they are a schooling fish that will feel stressed in solitude. Rosy barbs also have a tendency for aggressive or ""fin-nipping"" behavior; keeping them in schools of five or more will help reduce that tendency. Because of their fin-nipping nature, avoid housing them with slower-moving, long-finned fish.</p><p>Rosy barbs make a great community fish. They socialize well with other nonaggressive fish of a similar size that enjoy cooler water. Swordtails, gouramis, angelfish, knifefish, ropefish, paradise fish, danios, tetras, many American cichlids, and other barbs make suitable tankmates. Aquarium hobbyists have had success using rosy barbs as a dither fish in cichlid tanks; their brightly colored presence is evidence of a lack of predators nearby which attracts shy cichlids out of their hiding spots. Rosy barbs are agile enough to outswim most cichlids of the same size.</p><h2>Rosy Barb Habitat and Care </h2><p>Because they are one of the hardiest barbs, they are quite easy to care for in captivity. Always keep a secure lid on your aquarium, as rosy barbs are very good jumpers.</p><p>As long as you avoid extreme water conditions, rosy barbs can adapt to a wide range of conditions. Known to tolerate higher levels of nitrate, they are a good candidate for a new tank; they are more likely to survive the initial nitrogen cycling.</p><p>Although a 20-gallon aquarium will suffice for a school of rosy barbs, a 30-gallon tank or larger is better. Live plants are ideal, but avoid getting soft-leaved plants. Rosy barbs will nibble on plant matter in the tank, and soft-leaved plants may not survive. Java moss has been used successfully with rosy barbs, offering them shade and shelter.</p><p>They tolerate a lower temperature range than most tropical fish, from 64 to 72 F. Because of this, they can be kept as pond fish as well. Move them inside during the winter, especially in areas that are prone to cold weather.</p><h2>Rosy Barb Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Rosy barbs are omnivorous and opportunistic eaters. The rosy barb likes a variety of foods including vegetables as well as meaty foods. Feed them plant matter, insects, worms, crustaceans, flakes, pellets, and frozen foods. They will eat live foods as long as they are small enough, such as insects, worms or crustaceans, including brine shrimp and bloodworms.</p><p>In order to provide some nice variety, boil some zucchini or peas for them as a treat. Because of their tendency to graze on vegetation, rosy barbs eat away at hair algae that grow in aquariums. Rosy barbs are enthusiastic eaters, so be careful to not overfeed.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>These fish are difficult to sex when they are young. As they get older, the male becomes redder and more slender. The female remains smaller but plumper. Females lack the brighter red coloration of the males and are more yellow, olive, or gold.</p><h2>Breeding the Rosy Barb </h2><p>Rosy barbs are moderately easy to breed and become sexually mature when they have attained a size of 2.5 inches. When selecting a breeding tank for rosy barbs, a 20- or 30-gallon aquarium is optimal. Rosy barbs will only breed in water that is a few inches deep, but make sure to raise fry in the larger tank or their growth may become stunted. Allow for plenty of plants in the tank as they offer seclusion as well as a place on which to lay eggs.</p><p>For a breeding set up, have one male and two females. Select breeding trios from a school that has excellent markings and strong color. When ready to breed, the female will increase her color and become more vibrant. They typically will lay eggs at dawn as it becomes light.</p><p>When a male and female initiate breeding, they display behaviors of chasing and mock mating. The male will fertilize the eggs as the female scatters her several hundred eggs onto the substrate, onto a plant or decoration, or she may simply expel them into the open water. The eggs are adhesive. Neither parent cares for the eggs after spawning and will eat them if not removed from the breeding tank immediately.</p><p>The eggs will hatch in about 30 hours. Free-swimming fry should be fed infusoria, a liquid fry food, or newly hatched baby brine shrimp at least three times a day. Pay close attention when feeding; uneaten foods can quickly foul the water, and these fry require clean water to survive.</p>",931

Its metallic look, dynamic energy, and signature red eye with its pop of color combine to create an elegant display when kept in a school of six or more. This fish is also a good choice as a beginner fish. Water conditions fluctuate wildly in its natural habitat, so this fish can tolerate a wide range of differences and changes. The redeye tetra is a relatively larger tetra and should ideally be housed in a 20-gallon or larger aquarium.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Yellow-banded moenkhausia, yellowback moenkhausia, yellowhead tetra, lamp eye tetra</p><p>Adult Size: 2.75 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Redeye tetras are found in South America in Paraguay, eastern Bolivia, eastern Peru, and western Brazil. In the wild, they inhabit clear rivers but can sometimes be found living in the thick vegetation of the murky Amazon. Aquarium specimens are now bred extensively in Asia.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>If you have ever seen a school of these tetras with their bright silver body accented by a black tail and red eyes, it is obvious how they got their name. This peaceful medium-sized tetra is readily available and suitable for most community aquariums. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Redeye tetras are very peaceful; they are best kept in schools of six or more and will claim the mid-portion of the aquarium. Although they are easygoing, some owners report that they occasionally nip at the fins of slow-moving, long-finned fish. Redeye tetras are very active in the middle section of the tank and may disturb less active top-dwelling fish. In addition, other tetras may pick on them at times, so keep an eye on the community.</p><p>These tetras do well in a community tank. Good tankmates are other tetras, rainbowfish, barbs, danios and the larger rasboras. Most peaceful bottom dwellers will also make good tankmates.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>Redeye tetras tolerate a range of water conditions, from hard alkaline to soft acidic water. In nature, these fish come from regions with dense forests that let little light through, so keep their tank dimly lit; use dark substrate and plant cover along the sides and back of the aquarium.</p><p>These fish do not prefer fast-moving currents, so make sure to angle the filters to avoid disturbing them. Their ideal aquarium includes live plants, driftwood, and rocks to recreate their natural habitat and offer spaces to hide. Since this is a relatively large tetra, they require a 20-gallon tank or larger. For these tetras, at least 25 to 50 percent of the water should be replaced every other week.</p><h2>Redeye Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Redeye tetras are omnivores, meaning they will eat a variety of foods. In the wild, they feed on worms, crustaceans, and insects. In captivity, you can feed them fine flake food, small granules, live or frozen brine shrimp, daphnia, tubifex, and frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms. Offer a variety of food, including live foods, to ensure good health. </p><p>Vegetables should be offered regularly to bring out their best colors and appearance. Spinach is a great choice for this fish. This tetra prefers to eat multiple times a day. Offer only what they can consume in three minutes or less with multiple feedings per day.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Sexual differences are not overtly apparent in most tetras. Generally, the female will have a larger more rounded abdomen than the male. A female's belly fills with eggs when it is sexually mature. Males get very colorful when ready to mate. Select the brightly colored males for breeding.</p><h2>Breeding the Redeye Tetra </h2><p>When attempting to breed redeye tetras, set up a separate breeding tank with a slightly acidic pH (5.5 to 6.5), and very soft water (4 dGH or below). A 20-gallon spawning tank is fine, with a temperature of 80 to 84 F (26.6 to 29.0 C).</p><p>Keep the tank dimly lit with clumps of spawning mops or Java moss. A layer of mesh also works as long as the spaces are wide enough for the eggs to pass through and small enough to keep the parents out. A small, air-powered sponge filter is needed for filtration and will provide gentle water flow. Filtering the spawning tank water through aquarium-safe peat is a good choice as well.</p><p>Redeye tetras can be spawned in pairs, but for best success, spawn them in groups of about 12 individuals, with half a dozen each of males and females. Prior to breeding, condition the males and females in separate tanks. Feed them plenty of small live foods for about seven to 10 days. Select a breeding pair or small group and transfer them into the breeding tank in the evening. They should spawn the following morning. </p><p>If you provide floating plants, the breeding pair will often lay eggs among them. When they spawn, they lock fins, and then while clasped, they perform a type of roll-over process in the vegetation. The female releases about a dozen eggs at a time and the male fertilizes them. Because of this spawning behavior, the redeye tetra must not have too dense a spawning vegetation.</p><p>Once spawning has occurred, remove the mating pair, as they will consume both the eggs and hatching fry. The eggs will hatch one to two days after they are laid. Initially, feed the fry commercially prepared fry foods; then offer freshly hatched brine shrimp, and eventually finely crushed flake foods.</p>",891
30,https://www.thesprucepets.com/red-wagtail-platy-1378614,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Red Wagtail Platy: Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Red Wagtail Platy: Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The red wagtail platy is a pleasant and peaceful freshwater fish that's both hardy and active. It's also small, pretty, and a great fish for hobbyists of any level; in fact, it's one of the most popular in the fishkeeping industry. You can find platies in several different colors which make for an eye-catching tank. The platy has two goals in life: eating and breeding. They will circle the tank eating anything, including algae, and their breeding can't be stopped. Like guppies, platies are livebearing fish.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Red wagtail platy</p><p>Adult Size: 2-3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Platies, including the red wagtail, come from Central and South America, in the region from Vera (Mexico) to Belize. Platies prefer small, warm bodies of water with silty bottoms and vegetation, such as ditches, canals, springs, and marshes. Interestingly, platies were first brought to Europe during the early 20th century and quickly became an aquarium favorite due to their easy-going nature, pretty colorings, and prolific breeding habits.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Different platy varieties are similar to each other in size and shape but come in many color combinations. Salt and pepper platies are, of course, black and white; tuxedo and ""Mickey Mouse"" platies have unique markings described by their names. Like many platies, red wagtails are trapezoidal and have an orange-red body with black fins.</p><p>Platies are usually brown and yellow with dark spots in the wild though coloration varies based on the specific body of water in which they originated. However, wild platies are usually less spectacular than their crossbred, captive cousins.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The red wagtail is a harmonious species and it does best with similar freshwater fish. Good options include mollies, guppies, swordtails, and tetras. Male wagtails, while they can be sexually aggressive, are rarely aggressive toward other males; in general, they are compatible with a variety of tankmates. Be careful about adding more aggressive species, such as angelfish, to a tank containing platies, as platies can easily fall prey to larger, more assertive bullies.</p><h2>Red Wagtail Platy Habitat and Care </h2><p>All platies are especially popular with fishkeepers because they don't have any particular needs in the tank beyond clean, filtered water kept more or less at room temperature. Choose a tank that holds at least 5 gallons (but 10 gallons is better), and keep a ratio of at least two females to every male, so that the females are not constantly pursued to mate. Females also appreciate a few plants in which to hide out from persistent males.</p><p>The red wagtail platy is a good choice for new fishkeepers because they are easy to care for, but they do struggle in an early cycling tank. Wait until your aquarium's nitrogen cycle has been completed before adding red wagtail platies or risk the possibilities that your new fish will perish.</p><h2>Red Wagtail Platy Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Platies in the wild survive on not only protein but also algae, which provides them with plenty of fiber. Be sure your platies get plenty of fiber in their new aquarium home. In addition to the protein foods, they thrive on vegetables such as cucumbers, squash, and spinach. It's also a good idea to select flake foods that include vegetable supplements.</p><p>If they don't eat all foods provided in a few minutes, then you may be overfeeding. If you feed a flake food diet, supplement it with live food which offers much more nourishment. Try live or frozen brine shrimp as well as microworms, bloodworms, mosquito larvae, Daphnia, fruit flies, and chopped-up earthworms. Platies need to eat once or twice a day, and they are usually eager to eat but do not overfeed.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Platies are almost always ready for breeding. As a result, females often have round, bulging bellies (a precursor to giving live birth to dozens of fry). In addition, males are the individuals that are often in pursuit of females.</p><p>Visually, it's quite easy to tell male red wagtail platies from females by examining their anal fins (the lower fin behind the belly). If the anal fin is fan-shaped, your fish is a female. If it is long, flat, and pointed, your fish is a male. Females are also usually bigger than males, though this is not always the case.</p><h2>Breeding the Red Wagtail Platy </h2><p>Breeding the red wagtail platy is more than easy it's not a question of if but when. Females can warehouse sperm for up to six months; they are almost always pregnant with fertilized eggs and can give live birth to 10 to 40 fry every four to six weeks. Huge broods of up to 80 fry are even possible. If you're not interested in always raising young platies, purchase only male fish.</p><p>Platy parents won't eat their fry, but it's still best to put pregnant females in a separate tank in order to keep the fry as a separate population from the adults. Red wagtail platy fry are very easy to raise, and at least a few from each brood are likely to survive in a planted community tank.</p><p>If you want to rear a greater percentage of a brood, use a separate, bare, 10-gallon grow-up tank with an air-powered sponge filter to prevent fry from being sucked in. Feed them liquifry initially and then finely crushed flakes after a few days. Fry grow very quickly when fed two to three times each day. Change water every day and remove any waste and dead fry. It's important to keep the tank clean and free of detritus as juveniles are susceptible to pollutants.</p><h3>More Pet Fish Species and Further Research </h3><p>Platies and other members of the genus are easy to raise and wonderful additions to freshwater community tanks. Because they require minimal care and are usually quite hardy, they can make good fish for children.</p>",979

A piranha averages only 10 inches in size, and it is a cousin of the neon tetra. It is true that a hungry piranha will bite almost anything, even other piranhas, however, piranha normally bite on other fish or wounded animals not humans. Many more humans bite into piranhas as a food source than the other way around. </p><p>There are more than 30 varieties of piranha, and they run the spectrum from gang mobsters to peaceful scavengers. In most cases though, they are no more aggressive than angelfish. Before you get one make sure to check your local and state laws regarding piranha. In most of the states in the US, owning piranha is banned or tightly regulated in order to protect wild ecosystems. Because of their aggression and the difficulty in maintaining them, these fish are not recommended for hobbyists.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black shoulder piranha, red-bellied piranha, blacktail piranha, black piranha</p><p>Adult Size: 10 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Piranha are found across a wide geographical range in South America, including Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Guyana, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay. They live in the Amazon River basin as well as in the basins of the Paraguay, Parana, and Essequibo rivers. They also inhabit the coastal rivers of northeastern Brazil and numerous other small waterways.</p><p>Piranha mainly inhabit rivers, tributaries, and creeks. They are also found in larger bodies of water including lakes, pools, flooded forests, and the Pantanal wetlands of southwestern Brazil. These schooling piranha are generally found in groups of 20 to 30 fish.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>There are many species of piranha, but the most popular species in the aquarium trade is the red-bellied piranha. These fish have powerful bodies that are tall and laterally compressed, but they are thick-bodied. They are recognizable by the convex shape of their head and massive, bulldog-like lower jaw. With a large, powerful tail and a streamlined body covered with tiny scales, they are very fast and agile swimmers. They also have a small adipose fin between the tail and dorsal fin, a characteristic of all characins.</p><p>The red belly piranha has bright adult coloring. Body color can vary, but in most the back is a steel gray and the rest of the body is a silvery gold with a bright orange-red or red-colored throat, belly, and anal fin. It has large black spots on the sides, though they often fade with age, and it sparkles with many shiny scales. In its juvenile form, it is silver-colored with dark spots. Some individuals have such intense gold-speckling that they are sometimes called gold-dust piranha.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Piranha have odd companionship requirements. As juveniles, piranhas are schooling fish and should be kept in groups. However, as they mature, many varieties of piranhas become more solitary and may attack others of the same species.</p><p>A school of piranha is incredibly hierarchal and there will be a clear chain of command. Generally, the largest and most aggressive fish will become dominant. This fish will claim the best spots in the tank and be the first to feed. A challenge by another fish will result in aggressive behavior such as chasing, occasionally taking a bite out of fin, and even inflicting wounds.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>These fish are not considered to be a fish for a community tank. </p><h2>Piranha Habitat and Care </h2><p>Piranhas are messy feeders, so they need ample filtration and regular water changes to handle the bioload. You will need to change 30 to 50 percent of the tank water every other week.</p><p>A single specimen requires an aquarium of at least 40 gallons, but a group will require a much bigger tank. These apprehensive fish will be less timid if kept in a school of four or more and will be less skittish and shy in an aquarium with many hiding places. However, they do need plenty of swimming space.</p><p>Add bogwood and place plants around the perimeter to offer some cover; this helps them feel at home while leaving an open area for swimming. Provide a substrate of sand or fine gravel, and use dim lighting.</p><h2>Piranha Diet and Feeding </h2><p>All species of piranha require a high protein diet, taking meat, liver, fish, or any other flesh. They will not accept flake or pellet food. They will seize and devour any fish of any size introduced to their tank, gulping small fish whole, and slashing out large pieces from larger fish, not even hesitating to attack and eat fish three times their size as soon as they are introduced to a tank they are in. </p><p>In captivity, piranha they can be trained to eat whole dead fish, such as frozen silversides and lancefish, as well as a variety of other meaty foods such as prawn, mussels, and fish flesh. They will eat live foods such as feeder fish, earthworms, and river shrimp, but this is not desirable as it puts a huge pollution load on the aquarium. This omnivorous species has been reported to eat some aquarium plants as well.  </p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Piranhas do not have any distinguishable visual differences between the sexes. Around mating time, a female may get fuller in the belly as she fills with eggs, and males may get more brightly colored before spawning.</p><h2>Breeding the Piranha </h2><p>Unlike other characins, the piranha species are uncharacteristically parental. In nature, many use plants as hatcheries. In the wild, piranha breed when the rainy season sets in during January or February, but they seem to breed whenever conditions are right and water plants are plentiful. The female deposits her eggs on water plants or roots, which are then fertilized by the male.</p><p>Upon hatching, the fry stay attached to the vegetation in clusters until they have absorbed most of the yolk sac and become free-swimming. The parental male will attack anything coming close to the fry during this state, which is why, some scientists theorize, people get bitten.</p><p>Although you will rarely find piranha that breed in aquariums, Serrasalmus spiopleura is one of the few species which has actually done so with success. The male guards the eggs and the fry. Parents usually ignore the fry; they do not chase or eat them. The fry has been observed swimming around the adults. If you do breed piranha, beware! Since piranha viciously guard their eggs, they may bite the hand that feeds them!</p>",1040
87,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pictus-catfish-species-profile-5088722,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Pictus Catfish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Pictus Catfish Species Profile</h1><p>The Pictus catfish is a suitable addition to many freshwater community tanks. Its nocturnal nature just requires dim lighting or places to hide during the day. These fish have the potential to grow up to a yard long, but most Pictus catfish bred in captivity do not end up that large.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Pictus catfish, Pictus cat</p><p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 to 8 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Pictus catfish is a nocturnal fish native to South America. They are found in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins but have been kept in aquariums for many generations.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Pictus catfish has a characteristic silvery, smooth body with black spots. Like other catfish species, they do not have any external scales. They have the common barbels, used for tasting food deep in the substrate, and sharp spines on their pectoral and dorsal fin. Take great care when handling these fish to avoid getting poked by these spines. These fish are often snagged in nets, so using an open container to handle these fish is recommended.</p><p>If your hand is perforated by a catfish spine, clean it carefully and do not return your hand to the tank water. Fish Handler's Disease can be caused if these wounds are not treated carefully. If you have any family members with compromised immune systems, including young children and elderly, there is also the risk of spp. infection, commonly known as ""fish tuberculosis,"" with fish-related injuries.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Being peaceful, nocturnal fish, the Pictus catfish can be kept with many different species, provided they are not too aggressive during the daytime while the Pictus catfish is hiding. You can keep more than one Pictus catfish in a tank, just keep in mind their large tank size requirement.</p><p>When selecting appropriate tankmates for peaceful community aquariums, make sure their water quality parameters, specifically pH, kH and temperature, all agree.</p><h2>Pictus Catfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>The most important part of the Pictus catfish habitat is a quiet, daytime resting place. Do not expect to see your Pictus catfish much during the day unless you use subdued, muted lighting on your tank. During the daytime be sure to have a cave or log for your Pictus catfish to hide in. If you have other Pictus catfish, nocturnal species or bottom feeders, such as Plecostomous spp., be sure you have enough hiding places for everyone.</p><h2>Pictus Catfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The Pictus catfish is an omnivore and will adapt easily to a pelleted diet. Since they are nocturnal fish, be sure to leave some food out for them when you turn off the tank lighting. In tanks with dim lighting, you may see your fish come out to eat with the rest of your tank inhabitants. You are welcome to supplement your Pictus catfish with both meaty and veggie treats.</p><p>Don't expect this species to clean up after your other fish. Although they are bottom-feeders and will likely snack upon some detritus, it is not their primary diet and they will often require separate feeding due to their nocturnal nature.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Unfortunately, the Pictus catfish does not have any external sex characteristics. With individuals of the same age and care, the females may be larger than the males.</p><h2>Breeding the Pictus Catfish </h2><p>Breeding the Pictus catfish is not an easy endeavor. Many advanced hobbyists struggle with providing a suitable habitat for these fish to lay their eggs. A very large tank is recommended and using a group of fish will certainly increase your chances. Always make sure to properly quarantine all your new breeding fish, especially if they are coming from various sources.</p><p>As with any indoor aquarium setup, it is recommended to provide a breeding or spawning tank separate from the home tank in order to manipulate the water chemistry and provide a safe environment for any offspring. Due to the static nature of most indoor aquarium setups, changes to the water temperature or other water chemistry parameters are often required to initiate spawning.</p>",663

It is a labyrinth fish, meaning that it is able to breathe by gulping air at the surface of the tank. Like some other labyrinth fish, the pearl gourami can actually vocalize; don't be surprised if you hear your pet ""talking"" with growling or croaking noises, especially when breeding or fighting.  </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pearl gourami, mosaic gourami, lace gourami, diamond gourami, leeri gourami</p><p>Adult Size: 4.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 to 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This species originates in Thailand, Malaysia, and the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. They prefer acidic water found in lowland swamps near the sea. Some pearl gouramis have been introduced to Singapore and Colombia. It's rare to find wild pearl gourami for sale as an aquarium fish as most are bred in captivity. </p><p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species lists the status of this species as Near Threatened due to damming and water management use, modifications of its natural ecosystems due to logging, and direct harvesting of the wild populations of this fish.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Like others in its family, the body shape is elongated and laterally compressed. The ventral fins are long and thin, and they have the appearance of long feelers. The mouth is small and upturned. Pearl and brown flecks covering the body give it a mother of pearl appearance, from which it derives its name. A horizontal black line runs from the mouth to the tail, where it ends in a spot.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Pearl gourami are generally peaceful fish that do well in a tank community; however, avoid keeping them with overly aggressive tankmates. There are a few exceptions to this rule: The males, in particular, may be aggressive to others of the same species (or other gouramis in general). It is best to keep these fish with others of about the same size and temperament; they can also live happily with other small schooling fish. If you are keeping several pearl gouramis, a good grouping includes one male and several females. </p><h2>Pearl Gourami Habitat and Care </h2><p>Accustomed to heavy vegetation in their natural habitat, pearl gouramis will thrive if given similar conditions in the aquarium. Floating plants, subdued lighting, and a dark substrate are ideal. Although they prefer soft, acidic water, they are adaptable to a range of water conditions. This adaptability and their peaceful nature make them well suited to community tanks.</p><h2>Pearl Gourami Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Pearl gouramis will accept many foods and are generally quite easy to feed. Flake, freeze-dried, and frozen foods are all readily taken. For optimum health, offer fresh vegetables such as lettuce, cooked peas, and spinach as part of a varied diet. Live foods such as blackworms, brine shrimp, and glass worms are a good treat and should be used when conditioning fish for breeding.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male pearl gouramis have thinner, more angular bodies than females. They also have slightly different fins, sport a red breast, and are generally more colorful than females. Adult males are easy to distinguish from the females by their deep red-orange coloration on the throat and breast. Another clue is the dorsal fin which is longer and more pointed on the male than the female. When ready to spawn, the female will have a much plumper body than the male.</p><h2>Breeding the Pearl Gourami </h2><p>Breeding is relatively simple. Prior to breeding, feed the pair live or frozen brine shrimp and worms for conditioning. Provide plenty of floating plants and raise the water temperature to approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Reduce the water in the breeding tank to a level of about six inches. When fry have easy access to surface air it promotes normal development of the labyrinth organ.</p><p>The process begins when the male builds a bubblenest of up to 10 inches in diameter amid the floating plants; spawning will take place beneath it. After the nest is complete, he will begin to display to the female. As the female approaches the nest, both fish can be seen touching each other with their feelers.</p><p>During spawning, the male wraps his body around the female who will release hundreds of eggs. Several more spawnings occur and 200 to 300 eggs may be produced. The eggs float upwards into the nest and the male shepherds any strays. After the eggs have been laid, the female is chased away. It is best to remove her at this point or she may be seriously harmed by the guardian male.</p><p>The male then tends to the eggs until they hatch. After approximately four days, all of the fry (baby fish) will be free swimming and the male should then be removed to avoid him mistaking the young for food.</p><p>Feed the fry liquid food or infusoria culture several times a day. Offer freshly hatched or frozen brine shrimp at about two weeks of age. Fine-ground flake foods may be offered once they are approximately one month old. Perform water changes every two to three days. As the fry grows larger, distribute them between several tanks to reduce the lethal build-up of wastes. Poor growth or sudden loss of fry is often due to excessive waste creating poor water quality.</p>",880
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pearl-danio-1378466,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Pearl Danio Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Pearl Danio Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>If you're new to aquariums or just looking to add a pretty, peaceful fish to your community tank, you can't go wrong with the pearl danio. This easy-going species is hardy, easy to care for, and gets along with just about any other peaceful fish. Its iridescent colors make it unusually attractive. The pearl danio thrives in a smaller 20-gallon tank and reproduces readily in captivity.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pearl danio, spotted danio</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches (6 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Initially imported in Europe in 1911, this species has been a popular fish in the aquarium industry ever since. They originate from clear, swiftly moving streams and rivers in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), Thailand, and Sumatra. In nature, they feed primarily on insects and zooplankton.</p><p>This fish has several scientific names, a few of which were initially assigned to what were later determined to be color variants of the same species. Debate still exists over the classification of these differences in coloration. At one time this species was classified under the genus, which has since been declared invalid. The scientific name means white-lined danio.</p><p>The name of this fish should not be confused with the celestial pearl danio, also known as the galaxy rasbora, ,which is a dark-colored danio sporting red or orange fins and white spots on the body.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The iridescent colors this fish is named for make it one of the most attractive of the freshwater fish. Its pearly, blue-violet hued body is accented by an orange-red stripe running from tail to mid-body. Males are smaller, slimmer, and more colorful, often showing a red tint along the ventral aspect. A yellow-ochre color variant, known as the yellow danio, is available in some locations. Pearl danios have a forked tail and two sets of paired barbels.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Pearl danios are peaceful and well-suited for community aquariums and get along with any peaceful fish. They are tolerant of a wide range of water conditions, which also makes them suited to combining with a variety of other fish. Like others of the danio family, pearls live in schools and should be kept in groups of at least five to eight, and preferably more. Males will show their best colors if there is at least one female present.</p><h2>Pearl Danio Habitat and Care </h2><p>Originating from fast-moving streams and rivers, the pearl danio is accustomed to strong water currents. Because they require a slightly higher oxygen level than other danios, good filtration is important. Pearl danios tolerate colder temperatures well and may even be kept in an unheated aquarium. They swim at all levels, but due to their propensity for jumping, the tank should be well covered.</p><p>An extremely hardy and easy-to-care-for fish, pearl danios make an excellent beginner fish. As they require ample swimming room, longer tanks are preferable, with plants along the back and sides. Their iridescent colors are most visible under reflected, overhead lighting, and they are particularly fond of early-morning sunlight. Although undemanding about water parameters, they do best in neutral (pH 7.0) water that is soft to slightly hard.</p><h2>Pearl Danio Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Pearl danios will accept all types of live, frozen, and flake food. In nature, their diet consists primarily of insects and zooplankton. To maintain health, feed good quality tropical flake or granulated food, as well as frozen and live foods such as tubifex, mosquito larvae, brine shrimp, and daphnia.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male and female pearl danios are similar in appearance. The biggest difference is that, when full of eggs, the female will have a more rounded body shape. It is not unusual for females to be more robust than the males, as the females are larger overall, and fuller-bodied. Males are smaller, slimmer, and more brightly colored. The males often show a red tint along the ventral aspect.</p><h2>Breeding the Pearl Danio </h2><p>Pearl danios are an easy-to-breed egg-laying fish. As with other danios, when breeding pairs form they are very loyal. The breeding tank should be warm, 79 to 86 F (26 to 30 C), and the water level kept shallow, about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm). Fine-leaved plants should be provided, either floating or planted in a group. Marbles make an excellent substrate that will allow stray eggs to fall out of the reach of hungry adult fish. A breeding grid or mop on the bottom would also suffice to protect eggs.</p><p>Pearl danios will spawn as pairs or in a school. Half as many females as males should be placed in the breeding tank several days before introducing the males. Once the males are added, pairs will form and leave the group to scatter eggs.</p><p>Spawning can also be initiated by adding a small amount of water every few hours so that the tank is gradually topped up; this simulates the rainy season of the natural habitat. Pairs will spawn the next morning. The easiest and quickest way to tell is to look at the female; if the fish have spawned she will be noticeably slimmer. Remove the adults as soon as spawning is completed, otherwise, they will consume their eggs.</p><p>Keep the tank dark while the eggs develop, to prevent fungal growth. The fry will emerge in 36 to 48 hours and should be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp or infusoria. Young danios grow rapidly and will be free-swimming in six to seven days. Fry may be raised on finely ground dry food or commercially prepared fry food.</p>",914

However, don't let their small size and cute appearance trick you! Some of these tiny fish can be very aggressive, even against their own kind. Feed them a proper diet and provide lots of room to ensure a healthy and thriving population.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pea Puffer, Dwarf Puffer, Bumblebee Puffer, Malabar Puffer, Pygmy Puffer</p><p>Adult Size: 1 to 1.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Native to the Western Ghats of India, these cute little fish have been in decline since their introduction to the aquarium hobby. The Pea Puffer is found in many of the lakes and rivers of this region of India. They are listed as ""vulnerable"" on the International Union for Conservation, right above endangered. Please consider this carefully before deciding to bring these fish home.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Pea Puffer has a small, rounded body with a golden back that blends into a white or tan belly. Their back is covered in dark brown to black spots. Like many other puffers, their body is fairly round with eyes that slightly protrude from their pointed head. Their tail tapers to a point with a minimized dorsal fin and absent pelvic fins.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Due to their aggressive nature, there are few species that can be kept in the same aquarium. Most aquariums containing Pea Puffers will ONLY have Pea Puffers and no other fish. If putting them with other fish species, slow swimming fish will be nibbled on, so only fast swimmers should be housed with pufferfish. If you are adding these fish to an established aquarium, be sure they are the last to be added. It is best to always add the most aggressive species to a mixed-species tank last to give others room to call their own and claim places to hide.</p><p>Since they are carnivorous, it is not recommended to keep any invertebrates in their tank. They will become lunch for a ravenous Pea Puffer. This includes shrimp and snails.</p><h2>Pea Puffer Habitat and Care </h2><p>Pea Puffers like a well-maintained aquarium with lots of plants to hide in. Given their small nature, they are used to being snacks for larger fish, so providing cover, with either plants or other décor items, is critical to reducing their stress level. However, keep in mind that aquarium plants may affect your pH and oxygen levels, so make sure your tank can handle the bioload.</p><p>Pea Puffers tend to be more sensitive to poor water conditions than other freshwater species. It is critical for you to check your water chemistry and keep up with your regular maintenance.</p><h2>Pea Puffer Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Pea Puffers are carnivorous and require animal-based proteins in their diet. This will likely mean a wide variety of frozen foods in addition to a carnivore pellet. Keep in mind that vitamin content may become diminished in frozen diets, so a pelleted diet must be included to keep your Pea Puffer healthy. If your Pea Puffer is reluctant to eat a pelleted diet, be sure to feed a varied diet to round out their nutritional intake.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>As with many fish species, if all your puffers are roughly the same age and being fed the same diet, the female Pea Puffers will tend to be larger than males. Males also may have a black line on their belly.</p><p>Male Pea Puffers can be very territorial, so it is recommended to keep only one male per aquarium, or have an extra large tank with lots of space so there are no territory overlaps.</p><h3>Breeding the Pea Puffer </h3><p>Many hobbyists have had extreme difficulty breeding the Pea Puffer. Some have found certain aquarium plants and mosses to be more conducive to successful breeding, but this is not guaranteed.</p><p>With a healthy population of one male and his female harem, usually, the fish will spawn all at once, provided the correct environmental parameters have been met. Exact specifications for this species is unknown; most spawning occurs through much trial and error. It is highly recommended to move the eggs to a breeding tank to prevent predation post-hatch.</p>",705
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/panda-cory-1380838,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Panda Cory (Panda Catfish) Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Panda Cory (Panda Catfish) Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The panda cory, or the panda catfish, is a South American species of catfish with a black and off-white coloration pattern similar to a giant panda. Generally peaceful and social, panda corys can be a good addition to a smaller freshwater aquarium.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Panda catfish, panda cory, panda corydoras</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches (5 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This popular Corydoras (cory) species originates from Peru, where it is found in the Ucayali river system, the main headwater of the Amazon River. First collected by H.R. Richards in 1968, the species was not given its name until three years later when it was assigned the name corydoras panda by Nijssen and Isbrücker. The name was given in honor of the giant panda of China, which has a white body with black markings over the eyes and extremities, which are mirrored in this attractive cory.</p><p>The region from which the panda cory originates is known for its blackwater conditions. The water is on the acidic side and quite soft due to a lack of minerals. Additionally, these waters are a bit cooler than other tropical areas, running in the mid to low 70s on average. When initially introduced to the aquarium hobby, specimens were wild-caught, causing them to be rather expensive to purchase. Eventually, captive breeding programs greatly reduced the price, and as a result, the species has become not only quite inexpensive but also hugely popular.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The body of the panda cory is off-white to faint pink in color, with three prominent deep black markings. The first begins at the top of the head and covers the eyes, much like the black markings around the eyes of a giant panda. The second black marking covers the dorsal fin, and the third is at the base of the tail, known as the caudal peduncle. The size of this third spot at the base of the tail varies and has given rise to the big-spot and small-spot morphs of this fish, each being named for the size of the tail spot.</p><p>Like other members of the cory family, this fish has two rows of overlapping bony plates known as scutes, rather than scales. Panda corys have three sets of paired barbels, as well as several sharp barbs that serve as a defense mechanism. One barb is located under each eye, another in front of the dorsal fin, and another on the adipose fin. Adults can grow up to two inches in length, but quite often they remain smaller.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Panda corys are extremely peaceful fish that enjoy the company of their own kind. They should always be kept in groups, preferably of a half-dozen or more, but keep at least four if space is limited. Panda corys are highly social and are known to tag along with other bottom-dwelling species, most notably clown loaches.</p><p>Although they get along well with virtually all species, it is not wise to keep them with large or overly boisterous fish that might pick on them or appear to be threatening. Tiger barbs, for example, are not a good companion due to their tendency to nip at other fish. Small to medium-sized tetras, danios, and rasboras are good companions for panda corys. Other small catfish such as aspidoras, as well as any cory species, are also suitable.</p><h2>Panda Cory Habitat and Care </h2><p>Like other corys, the panda cory needs good water quality. Regular water changes are important, as is a good filtration system. Err on the side of over filtering with this species. Water temperature for this species is slightly lower than is typical of other warm-water species, as it originates from a region with slightly colder water than other tropical zones. Since almost all panda corys sold now are captive bred, most can tolerate warmer temperatures.</p><p>The substrate should be soft and fine; use either fine gravel or sand. Live plants are ideal, but not required as long as there is plenty of decoration that provides shade and hiding places. Caves, rocks, and driftwood are excellent ways to make this catfish feel comfortable and at home. Floating plants, either real or artificial, are helpful to provide shade.</p><h2>Panda Cory Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Panda corys are great scavengers that snap up any food that falls to the bottom. However, if housed in a community tank with other fish, care should be taken to ensure that sufficient food reaches the bottom of the tank for the corys. Sinking food tablets or pellets are a great option, as is lodging food under decor with tongs.</p><p>A varied diet is important for optimal health. Include meaty foods when possible, either live or frozen. Shrimp, worms, insects, and any crustaceans are good choices. They seem to be particularly fond of bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Several prepared food tablets are formulated specifically for corys and are a great food choice for panda corys. Keep in mind that this species is active at night, so consider dropping a few food tablets in the tank just before turning off the lights for the night.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>The female panda cory is larger and has a more rounded underbelly; females are much wider than the male when viewed from above. Often the rounded belly of the female causes their head to sit a bit off the bottom of the tank. Males are sleeker and shorter in length than females.</p><h2>Breeding the Panda Cory </h2><p>Breeding of this species was initially thought to be quite difficult, but time has proven that breeding is possible in the home aquarium. The breeding tank should be furnished with Java moss or other fine-leaved plants for the eggs to be deposited upon. The breeders should be well conditioned with live foods, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp or daphnia. Spawning can be triggered by a partial water change with cooler water to mimic the breeding conditions in nature that occur during the rainy season.</p><p>When the female is ripe with eggs, she will accept the advances of the male, and they will assume the classic ""T"" position seen in many Corydoras species. The female will cup her pelvic fins together and drop one or two eggs, which are subsequently fertilized. She then seeks a place to hide the sticky egg, generally on vegetation. This process will continue for several hours until as many as 100 eggs are laid and fertilized. These eggs are adhesive and light yellow in color.</p><p>In approximately four days, the eggs will hatch. They are quite sensitive to water temperatures, which should be no higher than 72 F. Fry do best with infusoria, but may also be fed commercially prepared fry foods if necessary. Water quality is critical, and water changes should be performed only with water that exactly matches the water parameters of the fry tank. It will take up to three months before the fry achieves the panda coloration of the adults.</p>",1136

This species is part of the family and also includes mutations with vibrant colors like yellow and blue, mostly black, and even all-white (albino).</p><h3>What is an Oscar Fish?</h3><p>Also known as the Tiger Oscar, Marble Cichlid, or Velvet Cichlid, Oscar fish are a tropical species native to South America. Different color varieties of the Oscar fish are popular for freshwater aquariums, though tank mates must have suitable temperament to coexist due to the Oscar's territorial nature.</p><p>While these fish are easy to spot because of their look, they're also known for their personality: Along with moving items around inside the tank, Oscars also present aggression towards other fish living in their habitat.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Oscar, Tiger Oscar, Marble Cichlid, Velvet Cichlid</p><p>Adult Size: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Like many South American cichlids, the Oscar originates from the Amazon and Orinoco river basins. They are common in the aquarium hobby with most individuals being captive bred.</p><p>They are commonly sold in South American markets as a food fish and have been introduced to Asia, Australia and North America. They are labeled a non-native pest species in many US states where fish have been released into the wild.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The common Oscar is also known as the Tiger Oscar, a darker brown to light green fish with highlights of red and orange. The color pattern can vary wildly with a characteristic eye spot, or ocelli, on the tail fin. There are albino variations with an all white body with red spots.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Be very careful when selecting tankmates for your oscar. Although they may start out small, many quickly outgrow smaller tankmates and then consume them. These are semi-aggressive cichlids who do not play well with many community fish. Remember, when choosing compatible cichlid species, make sure you select fish from the same region. Even though there are many varieties of cichlids, their origin will dictate what water quality parameters are best for them. Since oscars are South American, be sure to stick to other South American varieties.</p><p>For your oscar tank, it is best to select fish of a similar size who can hold their own. This includes Jack Dempseys, Convict Cichlids and Silver Dollars as a few examples.</p><h2>Oscar Habitat and Care </h2><p>Oscars are notorious redecorators. Do not get attached to anything in the aquarium and expect your fish to move everything. This is especially true of live plants with roots. Oscars will dig up plants, overturn rocks and toss sticks aside. It's just in their nature and there is not much you can do to deter rearranging behavior.</p><p>This aggressive nature towards their tank decor may turn against filtration and other life support items you have in their tank, such as powerheads and heaters. Oscars have been known to break these items, even if you try to be sneaky about hiding them. The best solution for many destructive oscar tanks is to incorporate a sump. In doing so, you can move all of your life support equipment out of the main tank and away from your fish.</p><p>Oscars are sticklers for good water chemistry, so it is vital that you keep up with your regular maintenance and check your water chemistry regularly. They are more susceptible to Head and Lateral Line Erosion, also known as Hole-In-The-Head disease, which can occur when fish are chronically stressed.</p><h2>Oscar Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Oscars are serious carnivores who will prey upon smaller, more docile fish in their tank. It is critical to select suitable tankmates who will not look or act too tasty.</p><p>As with most pet fish species, a well-rounded diet will consist of a pelleted cichlid diet and meaty supplements. There are many pelleted cichlid diets that are good for a wide variety of cichlid diets, carnivores included. Additional protein-rich foods to give your oscar include bloodworms, tubifex worms, frozen krill and other larger frozen diets. Although some recommend feeding your oscar live foods, this should be avoided in order to limit the spread of disease into your system and potentially overpopulating your tank.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There is a very small external difference between male and female oscars. You will need to safely catch and handle your fish, and flip them upside down to examine their urogenital openings. Oscar females will have one larger hole, which is the opening for their eggs. Oscar males will have holes of similar size. If they are not reproductively mature, the holes will look the same size regardless of their sex.</p><h2>Breeding the Oscar </h2><p>Even if you have one male and female oscar, they may not be interested in breeding. Oscars can be picky when it comes to selecting a mate. If your fish are not initially interested, do not despair and try moving them back to their main tank, incorporating different decor items to the breeding tank or getting a larger breeding tank.</p><p>It is recommended to breed your oscars in a separate tank away from other fish, in a 100 gallon tank or larger. Temperature is critical to induce spawning, and should be warmer than their usual tank, 79 to 86 F (26 to 30 C). You will need some rocky substrate for the fish to lay their eggs. The female will lay between 1,000-2,000 eggs which the male will then swim over to fertilize. The eggs and fry will be guarded by their parents and should remain in the breeding tank until they can fend for themselves.</p>",915

Neon tetras must be kept in groups of at least a half-dozen, as they are a shoaling species. With peaceful dispositions, they are also able to be kept with other species of non-aggressive fish. They have a decently long life expectancy of 5 or more years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Neon tetra, neon fish</p><p>Adult Size: 1.5 inches (4 centimeters)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Neon tetras originated from the clear water and blackwater streams and tributaries in the Orinoco and Amazon river basins in Brazil, Columbia, and Peru. These are regions of blackwaters beneath dense forest canopies that allow very little light to get through. Neon tetras live in shoals mainly in the middle water layers and feed on insects, worms and small crustaceans.</p><p>Neon tetras are generally all captive-bred, with most coming from fish farms in the Far East and Eastern Europe. Several varieties of captive-bred specimens are now available. These include the long-finned neon tetra, though it is rather rare, as well as a golden strain that is basically a semi-albino variety, and a diamond neon tetra that appears sprinkled with metallic scales along the top portion of the body. One variety has the blue stripe but not the red coloration.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The neon tetra has a slender torpedo-shaped body that reaches no more than an inch and a half in length. What this fish lacks in size, it makes up for in color. From the tip of its nose to the adipose fin, the neon tetra has a bright neon blue stripe. It is believed this bright stripe makes them more readily visible to each other in blackwater conditions.</p><p>Below the blue stripe, the neon tetra sports a white-silver belly. Past the belly, a bright red stripe extends all the way to the tail. The striking red, white, and blue combination make the neon tetra one of the most popular of all aquarium fish. It is rivaled only by the cardinal tetra, for which it is often mistaken. The key difference between the two fish is the red stripe. In the neon tetra, it only extends from the middle of the body to the tail. In the cardinal tetra, the red stripe runs the entire length of the fish, from snout to tail.</p><p>Like other colorful fish, the bright colors of the neon tetra will fade at night when it is resting, when it becomes alarmed or when it is ill. At the pet store, choose specimens that are actively swimming and robustly colored, as faded colors can be an indication of poor health.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Always keep neon tetras in schools of a half dozen or more as they are a shoaling species that requires the presence of others of their kind. Neon tetras do well in a community tank as long as the other species are not large or aggressive. Small peaceful fish such as rasboras, small tetras, dwarf gouramis, corys, and other small catfish are good choices as companions. Avoid larger tetras, as they will eat neon tetras at the first opportunity. The rule of thumb is, if the mouth of the fish opens large enough to swallow the neon, they will do it sooner or later.</p><h2>Neon Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Newly set up aquariums are not suitable for neon tetras as they will not tolerate changes that occur during the initial startup cycle. Only add neon tetras when your tank is fully mature and has stable water chemistry. Water should be soft and acidic for neon tetras, meaning a pH that is not above 7.0 and hardness of no more than 10 dGH. Blackwater extracts or driftwood are often used to darken the water, maintain an acidic pH, and soften the water.</p><p>In their natural habitat, neon tetras live in areas of dark water with dense vegetation and roots. Providing a habitat with plenty of low-light hiding places is important. Give them plenty of plants, including floating plants if possible. Driftwood will provide hiding places as well. The dark substrate will replicate the natural habitat in which the neon tetras feel most comfortable. Some fishkeepers will put a dark background on three sides of the aquarium to achieve the desired low-light habitat.</p><h2>Neon Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Neon tetras are omnivores, meaning that they will eat both plant and animal material. Fine flake food, small granules, live or frozen brine shrimp or daphnia, and frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms are all good food choices. Offer a variety of food, including live foods, to ensure good health.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Gender differences are not overtly apparent in neon tetras. Generally, the female will have a larger more rounded belly than the male. This rounded belly can even make the blue stripe appear curved on the female, in contrast to the very straight blue stripe on the male.</p><h2>Breeding the Neon Tetra  </h2><p>Condition the breeding pair with live foods prior to placement in the breeding tank. When introducing the breeding pair to the tank, begin with no lighting at all. The next day, increase the lighting and continue to do so gradually to induce spawning. Spawning will generally occur in the morning. The male will embrace the female during spawning, which will then release more than 100 eggs. The eggs are transparent and slightly adhesive and will stick to the plants. Remove the breeding pair as soon as the eggs are laid, as the parents will quickly eat the eggs.</p><p>Maintain low lighting as both the eggs and the fry are sensitive to light. The eggs will hatch in approximately 24 hours, producing tiny fry that will feed off their yolk sack for the next few days. Hatch rates are not high, so do not expect more than one-third of the eggs to result in viable fry. In three to four days the fry will become free-swimming and must be fed very small foods, such as infusoria, rotifers, hard-boiled egg yolk, or commercially prepared fry food. In a few weeks, they will be large enough to be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp. The fry will display adult coloration after the first month.</p>",1024

Although small, these peaceful fish are characterized by a vibrant blue stripe running along their length, giving them their other moniker of Neon Blue Goby. Members of the cleaner goby group, you may see them nibbling around larger fish to help keep them clean and healthy. The neon goby is easy to care for and readily breeds in even beginner setups.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Neon Goby, Neon Blue Goby</p><p>Adult Size: 2""</p><p>Life Expectancy: 1-2 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Neon Goby can be found throughout the Caribbean, from southern Florida and Texas all the way down to Belize. However, most of these fish available to the hobby are captive bred, protecting wild populations. These tiny fish make their homes among the crevices of reef structures. They are usually found together as a mated pair.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Also known as the Blue Neon Goby, this species is uniquely characterized by a bright blue stripe along its side. A long-bodied fish, the rest of this fish is a dark brown to black with a pale ventrum.</p><p>The neon goby looks very similar in color to the Broadstripe Goby and Sharknose Goby . They have a very similar body shape to the Yellowline Goby , and have been bred together producing gobies with a yellow to blue stripe. The Neon Goby can be confused with the Electric Blue Neon Dwarf Goby , which is a freshwater fish native to Asia.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A peaceful community fish such as the neon goby gets along with many different species of saltwater fish. Given their small size, they are well suited for smaller setups. However, mated pairs may become aggressive when defending their nest of eggs.</p><h3>Ocellaris Clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) </h3><h3>Yellow Tang (Zebrasoma flavescens)</h3><h3>Regal Blue/Hippo Tang (Paracanthurus hepatus)</h3><h3>Firefish Goby (Nemateleotris magnifica)</h3><h2>Neon Goby Habitat and Care </h2><p>Neon gobies do not have to be limited to nano aquarium setups. Their small size and easy-going nature make them ideal additions for many saltwater and reef tanks. Being cleaner gobies, they may set up a cleaner station, where larger fish stop by for an external cleaning. Don't be surprised if you see a willing goby swim into the mouth or gills of a larger fish! This is simply part of the cleaning process.</p><p>These tiny fish like to have a small cave or crevice to call home that is overlooked by larger fish. They may not always stay in the same place and may been seen roaming about the aquarium, especially when first introduced. Once a pair has been established, they will usually stick to their territory.</p><p>Given their small size, it is critical to keep a watchful eye out for these fish when doing any maintenance or moving decor. Before setting down a decor item, make sure you know where all your fish are!</p><h2>Neon Goby Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Neon gobies are true carnivores and require a high protein diet. As cleaner gobies, most of their wild diet consists of parasites picked off larger fish. A carnivore pelleted diet is sufficient, but occasional supplements with frozen treats, such as brine shrimp, mysis shrimp or chopped table shrimp are also appropriate.</p><p>You may not have to feed your neon gobies much if there are lots of other fish in the tank presenting themselves for cleaning. In a mixed species aquarium, it is hard to make sure everyone eats their specific food.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Although mostly identical, males and females can be differentiated by their genital papillae underneath their body. A complete examination usually requires removing the fish temporarily and looking at its underside while in a clear holding container. Male genital papilla are pointed, whereas females' are rounded. Like many fish species, females tend to be slightly larger and rounder than the males.</p><h2>Breeding the Neon Goby </h2><p>Even the most novice fish breeder can get a neon goby to spawn. If you have at least one male and one female, and provide a suitable home for spawning, your fish will likely do the rest. Neon gobies prefer a small cave or crevice in which to lay their eggs.</p><p>Be sure to provide a good environment with proper water quality, well-rounded diet and no aggressive tankmates. Some fish are picky about their light cycle to stimulate breeding. Educate yourself about proper fish breeding if you are having trouble and make a plan for maintaining any fry you hatch!</p>",732

They are a rarity, too. Not in the oceans, but in aquariums because most, unfortunately, die very easily in captivity. Many do not make it a week after you make the purchase. The primary reason is that they are such picky eaters, they would rather starve to death than eat something they do not want.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Moorish idol</p><p>Adult Size: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Unknown in captivity (high mortality rate)</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Moorish idol can be found throughout the Red Sea, the Indo-Pacific, and the eastern Pacific Oceans. It has been reported in the western Pacific from Kominato, Japan, down to Lord Howe Island, New Zealand, and in the eastern Pacific from the southern Gulf of California down to Peru. </p><p>It is called the Moorish idol as a reference to the Moors of North Africa, who are said to believe that the fish can bring happiness to those who dwell near it.</p><p>It is the only member of the family Zanclidae and a very close relative of the tangs or surgeonfish.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>These fish have disk-like bodies and are often mistaken for butterflyfish, which are also disk-like and have similar coloration. Moorish idols have starkly contrasting bands of black, white, and yellow. This fish also has small mouths at the end of long, tubular snouts and many long bristle-like teeth line the mouth. Moorish idols have relatively small fins, except for the dorsal fin, which has spines that form a trailing, sickle-shaped crest. Its scientific name, is a reference to its distinctive trailing crest. comes from the Greek meaning to ""bow on the back,"" especially like a scythe; Greek means ""horned."" Hence, the derivative ""horned scythe.""</p><p>If you're buying a Moorish idol, make sure that the color markings are dark and bright, not faded or washed out. If the fins and the tail appear to be frayed or ragged looking or are partially burnt off around the edges, and the fish's eyes are cloudy, this is most often a sign of exposure to ammonia burns. This condition usually stems from bad collecting and shipping practices, but it can also result from poor aquarium water quality and care.</p><p>If the sickle-shaped streamer is missing, but you can see a new, small white filamentous-like growth starting to grow out of where the streamer used to be, it's an excellent sign that the fish is getting the proper care, recovering, and regaining a state of good health. Now if the streamer is missing, but no new growth is yet apparent, it's a good idea to wait a week or two to see how the fish's condition progresses.</p><p>The fish's body should appear somewhat full and rounded out at the sides, the stomach area should not appear concave or sunken, and the skeletal structure of the fish should not be noticeable underneath the skin.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Typically the Moorish idol is a moderately-peaceful fish best kept with other non-aggressive species. Potential choices for tankmates include chromis, carnivorous grazers such as wrasses, and cave-dwellers such as more peaceful dottybacks. There are many opinions about keeping multiple numbers of these fish together. Some hobbyists recommend only keeping this fish singly or in mated pairs, while others suggest they only do well if introduced into an aquarium in groups of four, six, or 10, for example.</p><p>Large mature adults usually have a low tolerance for one other, and therefore keeping a single specimen or a mated pair is recommended. As far as juveniles, although this fish does seem to commune fairly well as a group, nonetheless their behavior towards one another can be unpredictable. Sometimes a group of smaller Moorish idols will get along just fine, while other times there may be one renegade in the group that becomes dominant, and decides to pick on all the others.</p><h2>Moorish Idol Habitat and Care </h2><p>Moorish idols should be provided with plenty of unobstructed swimming space, as well as ample reef-like hiding places to take refuge when feeling threatened. A tank of 150 gallons is recommended, although you can try a 100-gallon tank.</p><p>Moorish idols will often pick at large polypod stony corals and certain soft coral polyps. Although this fish primarily eats coralline algae and sponges in nature, this doesn't mean that it might not pick at other types of sessile invertebrates, or maybe even motile crustaceans.</p><h2>Moorish Idol Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Typically extremely difficult fish to keep, larger specimens usually do not adjust well to aquarium life. With the tendency to ignore foods offered, most often their health will decline due to slow starvation. Smaller juvenile or sub-adult specimens may more readily adapt to their surroundings, but just the same, these fish are unpredictable in their feeding behavior.</p><p>Before you buy one, make sure the one you buy is a proven eater. If you buy from an aquarium shop tell them a proven eater is a condition of the sale. If the fish has already been fed, ask when the next feeding is and return to witness it on your own. Then, match the food the shop is using exactly. Use the same feeding schedule.</p><p>For fish in captivity that refuse to eat, you may need a live rock that is rich with coralline algae and sponge growth to stimulate the fish's desire to eat and help it survive. Offer finely chopped fresh or frozen shrimp, clams, squid, and other meaty fares suitable for carnivores, live mysid, and brine shrimp, some vegetable matter, as well as supplemental vitamin-enriched prepared foods that contain marine algae and spirulina. Feed fish two to three times a day.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>This species does not seem to have any unique identifying characteristics between the sexes.  </p><h2>Breeding the Moorish Idol  </h2><p>The Moorish idol, like its surgeonfish cousin, is pelagic, meaning it's a free-spawner or egg-scatterer that spawns in groups. The female ejects small eggs in the water column after which the male swims over and through the egg cloud fertilizing as it goes. The female produces hundreds of eggs at a time several times per year, usually in the spring and summer months.</p><p>The clear, fertilized eggs float to the surface and join the stream of plankton where the larva feed and develop into miniature adults. </p>",1031

Its body is silver-colored with a slightly greenish hue that is not unlike the soft glow of moonlight.Like all labyrinth fish,  has a special organ that allows it to breathe air directly. Because of this labyrinth organ, it is not unusual to see it go to the surface to gulp air. The ability to breathe air allows these fish to survive in situations with very low oxygen. In fact, if this fish remains moist, it can actually survive out of water for up to several hours. The concave slope of the head in the moonlight gourami distinguishes it from other gourami species.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Moonlight Gourami, moonbeam gourami</p><p>Adult Size: 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Egglayer-bubble nest</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The moonlight gourami originates in the tropical areas of Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. It prefers still or slowly moving waters with plenty of vegetation such as ponds, bogs, swamps, and lakes. The fish are also found in the floodplains of the Mekong River. As it has been bred in captivity in various parts of the world, it has escaped from breeders and become an invasive species in both Singapore and Columbia. This species is also farmed for food in Southeast Asia. Most moonlight gouramis intended for the aquarium market are bred in captivity.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The moonlight gourami is long and flat; its head has a concave curve. Its ventral fins boast long filaments that are sensitive to touch; males' pelvic fins are red while females' pelvic fins are yellow or colorless. It has small, silvery scales which, as it matures, develop a pretty greenish iridescence. The eyes are red or orange.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Moonlight gouramis can be kept in pairs or groups in a community tank, so long as there are hiding places for the least aggressive in the group which is sometimes bullied. Other tankmates can include other labyrinth fish and larger species such as redtail botia, corydoras, and angelfish.</p><p>Avoid fin-nipping species such as clown barbs, as the moonlight gourami has long filaments on its fins which are very tempting. Even under ideal conditions, this is a fish that tends to be timid. It should be kept only with non-aggressive tankmates.</p><h2>Moonlight Gourami Habitat and Care </h2><p>Sturdy vegetation such as Java fern and are excellent choices for habitat. Although it makes a beautiful addition to a community tank, don't be surprised if it hides regularly. Although undemanding about water conditions, it does best in soft acidic water. Because it is so tolerant of less than perfect water, it is a good beginner fish. However, the water should be changed regularly to maintain good health.</p><h2>Moonlight Gourami Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The moonlight gourami will eat flake, frozen, and live foods. Serving a good variety of live and flake foods will help ensure optimum health. If you have a community tank with other large fish, make sure they aren't scaring the moonlight gourami away from the food. This is a timid fish that will not fight for its dinner, even if it is very hungry.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Females are wider than males and have more rounded anal and dorsal fins. Males can be identified by the orange to red coloration of the pelvic fins, as well as the long dorsal fins that end in a point. In females, the pelvic fins are colorless to yellow, and dorsal fins are shorter and rounder. During spawning, males' ventral fins turn from orange to red. </p><h2>Breeding the Moonlight Gourami </h2><p>The moonlight gourami is an egg layer that builds a bubble nest as do most labyrinth fish. Breeding of this fish is both easy and interesting. Provide a separate breeding tank, as other fish will consider these eggs and small babies (fry) a tasty snack.</p><p>The ideal breeding tank has very soft water that has been reduced to a depth of about six inches. The pH should be slightly acidic, and the temperature should be raised to at least 80 Fahrenheit over a period of several days to trigger spawning. Use dark gravel and provide plenty of floating plants for building the bubble nest. Feeding the breeding pair live foods before attempting to breed them will increase your chances of success.</p><p>The male begins the spawning process by carefully preparing a bubble nest. He then begins to court the female under it. This courtship dance is a fascinating display that should not be missed. Spawning culminates in the male wrapping itself around the female. While in this embrace, the male turns the female onto her back, which triggers her to release eggs. Up to 2,000 eggs may be laid during the spawning, which the male fertilizes as they float up to the nest. In the safety of the bubble nest, the eggs incubate for two to three days before hatching.</p><p>Once the eggs hatch, the fry must be fed very tiny foods several times daily. Most losses of fry are due to a lack of adequate food or too low water temperature. Live foods such as daphnia, artemia, and rotifers, are ideal. However, very finely chopped lettuce, banana skins, and finely ground flake food can be used to feed the young (and are usually easier to find). Keep the water temperature in the low to mid-80's while the fry (tiny juveniles) are growing.</p>",885

The Mickey Mouse platy boasts a ""hidden Mickey"" design located near its tail, is tolerant of a wide range of water conditions, and is relatively easy to breed. Rather than laying eggs, this species bears live young; the sudden appearance of the tiny fry can be fascinating for both young and old fishkeepers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Golden moon platy, mickey mouse platy, moonfish</p><p>Adult Size: 1 to 2 inches (3 1/2 to 5 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Native to North and Central America from Ciudad Veracruz, Mexico, to northern Belize in Central America, this platy is not considered to be endangered. Nonnative populations now reside in a number of locations within the United States, including California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and Texas.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>If you are wondering where this adorable fish got its nickname, just look closely at the tail area, and you'll discover a ""hidden Mickey."" Near the base of the tail is a large round black spot upon which are perched two smaller round ""ears"" that give it the spitting image of the popular Disney character, Mickey Mouse.</p><p>The fish itself may be pale yellow to gold, red to orange, or even bluish in color. The fins may range from pale yellow to red- or black-tinged. There are also long-finned and high-finned varieties. Despite the color and fin variations, all are the same species of fish.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The Mickey Mouse platy is very peaceful and lives sociably with a wide variety of other fish. Because they are not schooling fish, they don't need a great deal of room in which to move. Small tanks, therefore, are very comfortable habitats.</p><p>And yet, Mickey Mouse platies often prefer the company of other members of the genus Xiphophorus. These are all livebearing fish, such as the guppies, mollies, and swordtails. Other compatible tankmates include angels, catfish, danios, gouramis, and tetras.</p><h2>Mickey Mouse Platy Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Mickey Mouse platy is a terrific choice for new aquarium owners. Like other platys, the Mickey Mouse tolerates a wide range of conditions, and are suitable for even small aquariums. They will graze on vegetation, so keep that in mind if you have live plants. The ideal substrate is small to medium-sized and darker in color, which also serves as a good contrast to show off the pretty colors of this fish.</p><p>Water conditions are not critical. Alkaline water of moderate hardness is ideal, which is very similar to most city tap water. The temperature of a typical community tank, 76 to 78 F, will do quite nicely for the Mickey Mouse platy.</p><h2>Mickey Mouse Platy Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In nature, this fish feeds on live foods such as insects and worms, as well as vegetation. However, they are not picky and accept virtually any food, including flake, freeze-dried, frozen, and live foods. Live foods, such as brine shrimp, glassworms, and bloodworms, are a good supplement. Frozen or freeze-dried varieties of the same foods offer a good alternative.</p><p>A varied diet including plenty of vegetable matter ensures good health. Fresh produce such as lettuce, spinach, cooked peas, or zucchini will be readily accepted. In lieu of fresh veggies, try spirulina.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Like all live-bearing fish, Mickey Mouse platys exhibit sexual dimorphism, meaning males and females have externally visible physical differences. Females are generally larger, and sometimes are less vibrantly colored than the male. Males are easily recognized by the presence of the gonopodium, a modified anal fin used to hook the female and deposit sperm. Males also have a more pointed caudal fin.</p><h2>Breeding the Mickey Mouse Platy </h2><p>Like other livebearing fish, this fish is sexually mature as early as 4 months of age, which means young fish should be sexed and separated as early as possible. Females who mate retain sperm packets and can continue to give birth without mating again for a number of months.</p><p>Once mating has occurred and the eggs are fertilized, it takes about 30 days for the fry to emerge. The temperature can slow down or speed up the process; warmer water shortens the gestation period. Typical broods are 40 to 60 fry that are born free swimming.</p><p>As the fry develop, the belly of the female becomes larger. Eventually, the eyes of the fry can be seen through the stretched belly of the mother. As birthing time draws near, you should be prepared to shelter and protect the fry. Otherwise, the parents and any other fish in the tank will eat most if not all of them.</p><p>One option is to place the female in a breeding trap just before birth. The trap is designed so that fry fall through slits that are too small for the mother to follow. The downside of this is that the small trap is unnatural and stressful for the mother, so she must be moved well before she begins giving birth.</p><p>The better method is to have a separate birthing/nursery tank that is heavily planted with fine leafed vegetation. As the fry are born, they hide in the plants. Once the mother has given birth to all of her fry, she is removed.</p><p>The fry are born as fully formed very tiny fish. Initially, they need very fine foods to feed upon. Freshly hatched brine shrimp are ideal, but liquid or powdered fry food will serve as well. Feedings are required several times per day, which means that debris will build up more quickly in the tank, thus requiring daily water changes.</p>",937

If you are unlucky enough to accidentally get stung by your lionfish, immediately soak the wound in the hottest water you can stand. Heat will break down the proteins in the venom. It is recommended that you apply this treatment on your way to the doctor or hospital to receive more advanced medical care.</p><p>The lionfish's colors can range from a bold, bright red to a darker burgundy or maroon. Fins without venomous spines are usually almost transparent with darker brown, almost black, spots.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Lionfish are generally easy going tank mates for big fish, but their venomous protuberances may be a problem for more aggressive tank mates that may try to bother the lionfish. Multiple lionfish can be kept in one aquarium and one or two make a safe addition to a community reef or coral tank, provided that the other fish are large enough not to be eaten. Lionfish are sage to keep with corals and do not require a cave to hide in. Smaller dwarf varieties of lionfish may prefer a cave or crevice to call their own. These fish like slightly cooler saltwater habitats, so keep this in mind when choosing suitable tankmates.</p><h2>Lionfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>The most important aspect of a lionfish habitat is plenty of room to swim. Their venomous spines take up a lot of space and your fish will not do well if they keep getting stuck on décor. Keep your decorations minimal or provide lots of open swimming space.</p><p>Lionfish are relatively easy to care for, but it is critical to maintain good water chemistry. Keep up with a regular maintenance routine and be sure to check your water chemistry regularly.</p><h2>Lionfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Lionfish are top predators and require a carnivorous diet. Most saltwater community pelleted diets should be supplemented with frozen shrimp, fish or squid. It may be tempting to feed your lionfish live foods, such as goldfish or crustaceans, but keep in mind that this is a common method for diseases to enter your aquarium. You must quarantine all live additions to keep your system safe and healthy.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are no external differences between male and female lionfish. They are similar in size and appearance, regardless of their gender.</p><p>You will likely be able to tell males from females when your lionfish reach reproductive maturity and exhibit behavioral cues. You may see your fish form a pair and take over a small territory, or one male will chase other males away to establish his breeding harem.</p><h2>Breeding the Lionfish </h2><p>Lionfish are an invasive species in many parts of the world thanks to their reproductive strategy. They become reproductively mature in less than one year and are prolific spawners. In the wild, some lionfish have been observed laying over two million eggs per year.</p><p>The lionfish is able to be bred in captivity, with some species breeding in pairs or a group, known as a harem. As with breeding most fish in captivity, give your lionfish lots of extra room, preferably in a separate breeding tank. The females will lay a sticky egg mass, with the male following close behind to fertilize it. Some species have specific courting behaviors that you may need to keep watch for in order to successfully breed your fish. Before breeding lionfish, however, ensure you have a plan to manage any babies that are produced.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Do not let them go into the ocean!</p>",845
133,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lemonpeel-angelfish-species-facts-2920626,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Lemonpeel Angelfish: Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Lemonpeel Angelfish: Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The lemonpeel angelfish is one of the most gorgeous dwarf angelfish that you may find in a saltwater aquarium. With its beautifully composed color combination, it draws attention to any aquarium. A small-sized angelfish, it is often referred to as a dwarf or pygmy angelfish.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Lemonpeel dwarf angelfish, lemon peel angel</p><p>Adult Size: Up to about 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 11 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>These fish are found in the Indo-Pacific region, but several of these fish have been reported to inhabit the reef in Kaneohe Bay on Oahu, Hawaii. Not an endemic species to the Hawaiian Islands, it is believed that the presence of Hawaiian angelfish in Hawaii is due to the illegal release of unwanted aquarium pets into nearshore waters.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>This angelfish is often misidentified as the herald's angelfish . However,  has a uniform chrome yellow body, a blue ring around the eye, and dark-blue edges on the vertical fins, while  has a uniform chrome yellow body, often having a slightly orange tinge to it. Juvenile lemonpeel specimens have a large, black eyespot on the side of the body, which is often edged with blue.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The lemonpeel angelfish prefer to live solitary and stay close to shelter. It can be aggressive toward other angelfish. Two males will fight to the death. It is possible to keep a male and female pair or even a trio (one male and two females) of lemonpeel angelfish in the same tank together, provided that it is a large aquarium with plenty of hiding places, and they are introduced into the aquarium at the same time.</p><p>This species is well known for nipping and picking at large polyped stony corals and tridacnid clam mantles. The lemonpeel angelfish may also eat some soft coral polyps as well as pick at zoanthids. Therefore this fish, as true with most all angelfish, cannot be completely trusted if these invertebrates are present. Dwarf angels are territorial and they will pick on less aggressive and smaller tank mates.</p><h2>Lemonpeel Angelfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Water quality and tank size are important for lemonpeel angelfish. A suitable tank size for a single specimen is a 30-gallon tank. A 55-gallon tank is a more appropriate size for a mated pair or a trio. They can do well in a typical reef setting, but may eat away at some of the reef structure. Be mindful of their tank level preferences and make rock shelters in the tank that are suitable for hiding. </p><p>The lemonpeel angelfish is moderately difficult to keep. Keep in mind these angelfish are constant grazers. Giving a lot of food equals a larger bioload in the tank, so water quality must be monitored. They need a pH of at least 8.1, and water changes that do not include scrubbing algae off of the rocks. If the tank is 55 gallons or larger, a bi-weekly change of 10 percent to 15 percent would be good. If your tank is over 100 gallons, maybe every three weeks to a month do a 20 percent change, and so on.</p><p>The aquarium needs to be at least six months old or more to provide all the necessary algae to feed your angelfish.</p><h2>Lemonpeel Angelfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The lemonpeel angelfish is an omnivore, but their diet mainly consists of algae. This is a type of angelfish that does not adapt as quickly to tank-fed foods, which makes it a little more difficult to keep.</p><p>It should only be introduced into an aquarium that is well established with ample live rock for grazing, or a good healthy population of macroalgae growth and diatoms to feed on. Providing this type of habitat stimulates the fish's natural eating habits, and with patience and coaxing it will usually begin accepting a variety of tank-fed fares suitable for omnivores. When a fish sees other fish eating a certain food, quite often it will also start eating that food. Feed them two to three times a day and offer a variety of foods. You can feed them prepared foods with marine algae, spirulina-enriched foods, mysid shrimp, shaved shrimp, and brine shrimp. </p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>All angelfish are born female. As they grow, the larger and more dominant fish will become male and if the male dies, the angelfish next in line in the hierarchy will turn male. Putting a larger and smaller fish together is the best way to get a pair, possibly in about a two- to three-month period. Be mindful and watch for aggression during this time.</p><h2>Breeding the Lemonpeel Angelfish </h2><p>In the wild, like many other marine organisms, they reproduce by external fertilization. They are pelagic, or egg scatterers. They release eggs and sperm simultaneously at dusk. They dance, then rise into the water column and release their eggs and sperm near the top of the water.</p><p>Lemonpeel angelfish are very difficult to successfully breed in captivity. They prefer warmer water, especially when spawning, requiring excellent water quality, and then good food for the larvae.</p><p>A larger, deep tank is needed, as well as a stable lighting schedule to encourage spawning. You can copy nature's dusk light cycle by having half of the brighter lights go out, then an hour later let the other half go out. Do this at a consistent time every day. The fish need a temperature of 72 F to 80 F for 14 to 16 hours a day. They also need a tank that's at least 20-inches high to allow for their rising and spawning behavior.</p><p>The eggs will hatch in just under 24 hours, and after hatching, within 24 to 36 hours they need microscopic algae for their very small mouths. Since raising babies are difficult, much preparation is needed. The larvae react to only certain kinds of live foods. It has been found that they won't eat rotifers. Baby brine shrimp are simply too big for them. But, they may eat copepods.</p>",960
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kissing-gourami-1378313,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Kissing Gourami (Kisser Fish) Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Kissing Gourami (Kisser Fish) Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The name kissing gourami (or kisser fish) is derived from what appears to be kissing between fish; however, scientists still are not sure of the true purpose of the behavior. It is believed to be a harmless territory-challenging behavior that generally occurs between two males. This conjecture is supported by the fact that aging seems to diminish the need to challenge one another. Also with age, the desire for mating territories diminishes.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Kissing fish, pink kissing gourami, green kisser</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Average of 7 years; can be long-lived, up to 25 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The popular kissing gourami, commonly called a kisser, originates from the Indonesian island of Java and is also found in Borneo, Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. It is commonly cultivated in the southern Indochina region as a food fish. Today, virtually all specimens sold in the United States are commercially bred in Florida. Additionally, Thailand and Singapore commercially breed this species for the aquarium trade as well as for food consumption.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>There are three color variations of this fish: a pink or flesh-colored form; a silver-green form often referred to as the ""green kisser;"" and a mottled or piebald variety. The pink variation does not occur as frequently in nature and is the result of a reduction in pigmentation known as leucism. This trait has been selectively bred for the aquarium trade, due to the color preference by owners.</p><p>The green specimen sports the naturally occurring coloration. It has a dark bar bordering the dorsal and anal fins. Both pink and green have at times been described as separate species, but this is not the case. A mottled or piebald variation is also sometimes seen in the hobby, however, it is less popular than the pink variety.</p><p>A second mutation that has been selectively bred in the aquarium trade is a fish that is shorter and rounder, giving it a balloon-like appearance. This mutated strain is not as hardy as the naturally occurring varieties, and it has a shorter lifespan.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Kissing gouramis have been known to be quarrelsome with some species of fish and should not be kept with smaller fish. Although they can be kept in a community tank with medium size fish, owners should observe them closely to ensure they are not bullying others. Potential tankmates may include loaches, barbs, large tetras, some types of cichlids, and some catfish.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Kissing gouramis will sometimes ram the sides of other fish, stripping them of their slime coat, and may potentially damage their skin. If this occurs, it is wise to separate the fish.</p><h2>Kissing Gourami Habitat and Care </h2><p>In nature, kissers are usually found in slow-moving, heavily vegetated ponds or marshes. They are a hardy fish that will tolerate a range of water conditions. These fish have a hidden structure called the labyrinth organ. It enables them to take oxygen from the air, allowing them to survive in waters with low oxygen levels.</p><p>In fact, the gills of labyrinth fish are usually not even capable of obtaining enough oxygen from the water to survive. Therefore, they must satisfy most of their oxygen requirements by gulping air at the surface of the water. For this reason, it's essential to provide them with access to the water surface in all tank zones.</p><p>Kissers need warm water, and they need to consume plenty of plant matter. As a habitat, use artificial plants or sturdy live plants such as Java fern or Java moss. Tender live plants are likely to be eaten down to the stem.</p><p>In nature, kissers grow to a size of a foot or more, but in captivity, they generally remain about half that size. However, even a small kisser will grow too large for an aquarium smaller than 30 gallons, so this species should not be kept in mini-tanks. With proper care, it is not unusual for these fish to live well over a decade.</p><h2>Kissing Gourami Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Kissing gouramis are omnivorous fish. On the inside surface of the kisser's obvious lips are rows of fine teeth which are used to graze on algae and vegetable matter. Periodically provide fresh romaine lettuce, cooked zucchini, or peas to keep your kissers in optimal health. But take care when providing fresh vegetables, as uneaten portions will quickly foul the water.</p><p>They should be provided with plenty of spirulina-based foods as well as fresh vegetables when possible. Kissers also accept a variety of protein foods, including flake, frozen, freeze-dried, and small live foods, such as tubifex and brine shrimp.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Both sexes of kissing gourami look almost identical, from their oval shape to their thick fleshy lips. It is almost impossible to determine the sex of these fish until they spawn. At the mating period, the body of the female becomes round as it fills with eggs.  </p><h2>Breeding the Kissing Gourami </h2><p>Potential breeders should be conditioned with live foods and provided with a large tank with soft, warm water (80 degrees F). Unlike other labyrinth fish, kissers do not build elaborate bubble nests, although the male may blow bubbles randomly at the surface.</p><p>Spawning begins by circling which progresses to nudging and dancing. This is followed by an intense beating of tails. Eventually, the male wraps his body around the female, turning her upside down. The female will release hundreds or even thousands of eggs which are fertilized by the male as they rise to the surface.</p><p>If floating plants or lettuce are placed on the surface before spawning, the eggs will adhere to them and the fry can feast upon the infusoria that grows on the vegetation. Remove the parent fish following spawning, as they may eat their own young.</p><p>Eggs will hatch in approximately one day, and in another two days, the fry will be free swimming. Feed them very fine flake foods or small live foods such as freshly hatched brine shrimp.</p>",976

In the aquarium cichlid hobby, two different species are known as jewel fish, the one discussed in this article is the</p><p>The other is the larger that is totally undesirable for the home aquarium. The jewelfish will not hesitate to attack a human hand and bite hard to discourage any threat to its young. This fish is definitely not recommended for a community aquarium.</p><h2>Species Overview </h2><p>COMMON NAMES: Jewel fish, African jewelfish, two-spotted jewelfish, green jewel, blue jewel</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 4 to 6 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5+ years</p><h2>Origins and Distribution </h2><p>Native to West and Central Africa, Hemichromis species are found in creeks, streams, rivers, and lakes.

They are very brightly colored and their colors become even more intense during breeding. With a cherry-red body, these fish are covered with reflective light blue small blotches over the entire body. Two large black ""eye spots"" are present on the lateral line. One black spot is located behind the gill, and the other is located mid-body.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Other than other juvenile members of their own species, no tank mates are acceptable for this defensive fish. They are not suited for a community tank.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>Water conditions are not critical in this species. However, these fish must be provided an efficient filter system, to ensure clear and clean water at all times. Use a sandy substrate as this cichlid likes to root around and dig at the bottom of the tank. Anything rougher could cause them injury from this behavior.</p><p>Similar to many other species, these fish also tend to dig into the substrate which ends up disturbing the live plants. However, plants such as the Amazon sword plants and the cryptocoryne plant species which do well. Other plants may also be fine as long as you attach them with driftwood or protect their roots with stones.</p><p>Large rocks mounds will help mimic their natural habitat in rivers, streams, and lakes. Fish will seek their own territories in the tank. Many different options for territories on the bottom will help prevent territorial spats. Use sunken logs and overturned flowerpots to mimic small caves in rocks.</p><h2>Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Live foods are preferred. Frozen foods are accepted and should be given at least once per week; good high-quality flake food is also accepted. A diet of all live or frozen proteins should be fed heavily for a week to condition the fish for breeding.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are no known observable differences between the sexes in this species.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>Probably the most remarkable fact about the jewelfish is the relationship in the mated couple. This species comes as close to a ""married life"" in the full sense of the word as can be found among all captive species of tropical aquarium fish.</p><p>At breeding time, both genders are combatants. If they are not fully matched in size and strength, the mating battles may lead to injury or death of the smaller and weaker individual. Always make sure that when a balanced pair is introduced into a tank there is plenty of refuge among built-up rocks and plant thickets. A half-round flowerpot placed in a dark corner will usually be the preferred site for spawning.</p><p>Pairing begins with a ritual ""fight"" which is presumably designed to determine the strength and stamina of a mating partner. Once they come to a truce, members of this species mate for life. The male will eventually become larger and will give his life to protecting his mate.</p><p>The parents do everything together from preparing the nesting site to caring for the eggs and protecting the young. They share faithfully in all these tasks and spend a large part of each day during the breeding season in activities designed to give their offspring the best possible start in life. Their ""family sense"" and the way in which the couple sticks together and shares the work is as remarkable as the fact that the mated pair later remains together far beyond the time needed to rear the new generation.</p><p>This has led some observers to wonder whether these fish, as well as closely related species that behave in a similar fashion, may become attached to their mates as individuals. Scientists have studied whether these fish can recognize their partners, and react to the substitution of different males or females. </p><p>Although observations so far have not been conclusive, there seems to be some evidence that individual attachment among mated couples of certain cichlids appears possible. If for some reason the male or female should die, it is very likely that if another mate is introduced, the remaining fish will kill or badly damage the new arrival.</p><p>Unlike with tetras or other shoaling fish, cichlids and especially the jewelfish should always be purchased as a pair. Get assistance in the store to pick a male and a female of the same size. In order to observe the entire sequence of breeding behavior without any disturbance, it is best never to have more than one male and one female of the species in your aquarium. </p>",947
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/horseface-loach-1381070,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Horseface Loach (Horsehead Loach) Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Horseface Loach (Horsehead Loach) Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The horseface or horsehead loach is a relatively shy bottom-dweller that likes to burrow into the substrate; it will sift the sand through its gills in search of microorganisms or other food. Its long snout is reminiscent of a horse muzzle, hence its name. Peaceful and tolerant of aquarium life, this interesting looking fish is fun to watch as it successfully hides from other fish right near by.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Banana fish, horseface loach, horsehead loach, longfaced loach, long-nosed loach</p><p>Adult Size: 8 inches (22 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The horsehead loach is found widely throughout Southeast Asia including Borneo, Java, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sumatra, Thailand, and Vietnam. This wide distribution has led some to question if this is indeed a single species, or rather a group of closely related species that have not yet been differentiated. In the wild, species are found in fast-flowing rivers and streams that have mud, sand, or a fine gravel bottom.</p><p>First imported to Europe in 1929, this species is now exported extensively. To date, these fish have not been successfully bred in captivity, so all specimens sold in the aquarium trade are wild-caught.</p><p>During a revision of loaches by the scientific community in 2012, the scientific name for the horsehead loach was changed from to. However, it is common to find it referred to by either name, as well as by several older synonyms.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Elongate in shape, this loach has dark spots sprinkled over a yellowish-brown body color. The color patterns vary somewhat based upon the natural habitat in which the particular fish originated. At the end of the horse-like snout are three pairs of small barbells.</p><p>The caudal fin of the horseface loach is slightly forked, and the belly is flat and lighter in color than the rest of the body. Like other members of this family, this species is equipped with a pair of extremely sharp spines under the eye orbits. These spines can be extended as a means of defense when the fish is threatened or attacked. Care should be taken when netting this species, as these spines can easily become entangled in the net.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>It is quite common to find this fish nestled under the substrate. They will remain just below the surface of the sand, with only their eyes poking out to allow them to monitor activities nearby. While below the surface, they will sift the fine substrate for small particles of food. Generally, this species is a rather slow swimmer but it is capable of making surprisingly quick darts about the tank when startled. This species is predominantly nocturnal.</p><p>Generally a peaceful species, the horseface loach may be combined with other peaceful loaches as well as other peaceful species that occupy the middle and top strata of the tank. These include barbs, danios, rasboras, and tetras. However, this species will do better when it is kept with others of its own kind. Ideally, keep at least a half-dozen of them together, if space allows. Within their own species group, they will often establish their own hierarchy, and may even establish territories that they will defend. To support a school of loaches, always consider a larger aquarium.</p><h2>Horsehead Loach Habitat and Care </h2><p>When building a habitat for this species the substrate is particularly important. Because they spend much of their time buried, they must have a fine substrate of either sand or fine gravel. If live plants will be used in the tank, do not plant them with bare roots, as they will be uprooted quickly. Instead, plant them in pots to keep them in place. Sturdy plants such as anubias are ideal. Another option for live plants is to use floating plants, which also subdues the lighting, something that this species prefers.</p><p>Driftwood and smooth rocks can also be used in the décor, being placed in such a way as to provide hiding spots. Good water movement is important, as this species requires an oxygen-rich environment. Frequent water changes are also necessary, due to the horseface loach's sensitivity to organic waste. The tank should be mature, as this fish does not cope well with the rapidly changing chemistry of a newly established aquarium.</p><h2>Horsehead Loach Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Relatively easy to please, this species will eat most foods that are offered. This fish particularly enjoys live foods and is accustomed to eating small crustaceans and insect larvae in their native habitat. Offering a varied diet will keep them in optimal health.</p><p>Since they are bottom feeders, make sure that food is reaching the bottom. This may require providing sinking foods in addition to other types of food. Live or frozen brine shrimp, mosquito larvae, daphnia, tubifex, and bloodworms are all good options for this loach. Lodge live food near the bottom with tongs. Supplemental algae wafers or tablets are welcomed as well.</p><p>Because they are more active at night, providing a moonlight is a good way to get an opportunity to observe these fish. Once the primary lighting is switched off, they sometimes will come out in the dim light to actively forage for food. Dropping a bit of sinking food in the tank after the main lights are off will help nudge them to come out of their hiding spots.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are very few clear-cut sexual differences between males and females other than size. Adults can reach a length of eight inches, but in most cases, captive specimens remain smaller. Adult females will typically be larger than males, and will also be rounder. </p><p>In males, the first few branched rays of the pectoral fins are extended. However, that subtle difference is not always easy to spot, especially when the fish spends much of its time buried in the substrate. </p><h2>Breeding the Horsehead Loach  </h2><p>There have been no documented instances of this species having spawned in captivity; this includes commercial breeding as well. All specimens sold in the aquarium trade are wild-caught, but their populations in the wild remain robust.</p>",986

Likewise, many aquarists who keep these popular fish have also never learned of their flying ability, which is really quite remarkable for their small size. In nature, hatchetfish make long, gliding flights using their powerful ""wing-like"" fins to fly over the top of the water. In captivity, these beautiful fish can live in a home aquarium but will not attempt to fly.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Marbled hatchetfish</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: Carnegiella strigata</p><p>ADULT SIZE: 1 to 1.4 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Of the genus commonly referred to as hatchetfish, a total of three species are known, Carnegiella myersi, Carnegiella marthae, and Carnegiella strigata. Only Carnegiella strigata is commonly known and represented by not less than five sub-species, which are commonly seen today in aquarium stores.</p><p>The hatchetfish originates in the marshes, flooded regions, brooks, ditches, and in the small and large rivers all over The Guianas in northern South America. It is especially common in the jungle streams of the central and lower parts of the Amazon River basin.</p><p>Hatchetfish dwell immediately beneath the surface of the water where they like to hide among marsh and water plants and elevated roots. Groups shoal together as they continually search for larval insects and small aquatic invertebrates. When a larger fish approaches to prey upon them, the hatchetfish are in the air and far away from danger in an instant.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Hatchetfish get their name from their peculiar shape. From the side, they look like triangles that are rounded only at the bottom, not unlike the shape of a hatchet. From the front, they are thinner than a cracker, tapering to a wedged knife-edge along the belly. The disproportionately deep body contains large muscles that contribute to the fish's ability to flap its fins in flight.</p><p>In the marbled hatchetfish, the basic coloration is brownish to golden yellow with a silver sheen; the back is dark green with black dots of varying size. The flanks are covered with a pattern of spots typically of a pink to brown color, changing to light blue. A pair of dark stripes may be seen on the sides of the head; a black lateral line, bordered on the upper side by a gleaming silver stripe runs from the gill covers to the caudal fin.</p><p>From the edge of the belly run three irregular dark blue to brownish-black stripes angling forward and backward across the body. The streak lying above the anal fin is also blackish. The fins are light greenish and transparent. The caudal fin is clearly green.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Hatchetfish are shoaling fish, which means they like to be kept in a group of 10 or more. Any skirmishes in the group are only a form of play, and no harm ever comes of it. They are very tolerant of bottom dwellers and can be kept without danger among quiet and mild-mannered species of fish of about the same size.</p><h2>Hatchetfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>After about 48 hours of thwarted attempts, captured wild hatchetfish will never attempt flight again. It is truly unfortunate that we do not get to see these fish fly in the aquarium, but they have been bred in captivity for so many generations that they have lost the will to even attempt the feat even when startled from below. </p><p>This fish is an inhabitant of exclusively blackwater environments. They prefer fallen branches, live plants, rock outcroppings and require room to swim in and around them. Putting these unique fish in a bare tank will make them feel very vulnerable and insecure; they will not long survive.</p><p>Hatchetfish are a very popular addition to aquariums, however, it is important to remember that this is fish that lives under the forest canopy. Provide a large aquarium with subdued or dimmed LED lighting. Use plant species that grow up to the surface of the water to simulate their natural environment. Use a dark substrate to simulate the river bottom.</p><p>It is unlikely that the fish that you buy in local stores and bred in captivity would try to fly, but do not take the chance; it has been known to happen. It should go without saying that any aquarium containing hatchetfish should be covered with a full aquarium hood to avoid unscheduled flights.</p><h2>Hatchetfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In nature, they are insect eaters and larva eaters taking terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates and other zooplankton taken at or near the water surface. They are very effective in keeping mosquito populations down.</p><p>In the aquarium, it will accept dried foods of a suitable size but should also be offered regular meals of small live and frozen fare such as nauplii,, or grindal worms. fruit flies or other young insects you can raise in bulk can also be fed, although it's best to fill the stomachs of these insects (bio-loading) by feeding them fish flakes and vegetable matter before offering them to the fish.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>External sexual characteristics are unknown. Some specimens do grow larger and fuller-bodied than others and are likely adult females. There are slightly different strains of color lines, part due to inbreeding, and partly due to observation technique. When not in prime breeding condition, or when one is not observing closely, all hatchetfish simply appear silver.</p><h2>Breeding the Hatchetfish </h2><p>Spawning in this species is possible but it is not common. This is a very difficult fish to breed, and it is only to be attempted by an expert breeder or someone who wants a challenge and has the time, space, and patience to attempt it.</p><p>This species scatters its eggs among the high roots of plants very near the surface of the water at the natural dusk of a tank that is lit by natural sunlight. Spawning also may occur by simulated moonlight. Temperature is very important to spawning; 86F best simulates late spring/early summer in their natural habitat.</p><p>When spawning, males do a fluttering dance parallel to the females on the shoots of finely feathered plants under the water's surface. The sticky scattered eggs cling to these fine-leaved plants. The rearing of the fry, which hatch after 24-30 hours, is not difficult. Feed them on rotifers (infusoria) and later baby brine shrimp.</p><p>Hatchetfish are not egg eaters, so timing is not as critical as with many of the other tropical fish. However, hatchetfish parents will actively eat the fry as soon as they hatch, so remove the parents within 24 hours. Also, make sure the plants used in a breeding tank are free of snails as fish eggs are a snail's favorite food.</p>",1086

It comes from the Malay Peninsula, Thailand, and Sumatra. It is the most common and the easiest-to-keep member of the rasbora family and was first imported into Europe in 1906, making its way to the rest of the world's aquariums soon thereafter.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Harlequin rasbora, harlequin, harlequin fish, red rasbora, red razor</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 to 4 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The natural origins of the are the harlequin rasbora are the rivers and streams of the Malay Archipelago, Thailand, Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Singapore, Borneo, and Sumatra. In the wild, these fish prefer peat swamps and gently flowing areas of forest streams and tributaries where vegetation is thick. Light in these areas is filtered by leaves and tends to be fairly dim.</p><p>The water in the harlequin rasbora's natural setting is extremely soft, and its temperature often rises quite high during the day and drops much lower at night. Currently, most of these colorful little fish have been raised on Florida tropical fish farms and in aquariums so their natural need for very soft water has somewhat abated.</p><p>Since the advent of air travel, harlequin rasboras have been imported by the tens of thousands from their native Malaya. In spite of constant demand, the source in their natural home is never depleted. They swarm in great numbers in pools in Malaya; even when all are caught in a large net, the pool fills up with fish again in what seems like weeks.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The appearance of the harlequin rasbora, with a dark triangular patch extending all the way back from the front of the dorsal fin, is very distinctive. The silvery tone of the rest of the body may be broken with yellow or reddish markings, which has resulted in this species' nickname, the red razor. Males tend to be brighter in color and have slimmer bodies than females. The female has a rounder lower profile and, at breeding time, becomes quite plump.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>In nature, the harlequin rasbora does not usually tolerate contact with fish of other species; if you keep them in a community tank, keep at least five or seven (or more), and make sure there are plenty of places to hide. Choose small, peaceful tankmates that are unlikely to agitate or attack them. In a peaceful tank, your harlequin rasboras will be happy community members and will not bother any other fish in the tank.</p><p>Shoaling fish should always be kept in odd numbers of three, five, seven, or more to ensure that there will be odd numbers of males and females. This encourages competition and interest in the shoal, keeping them together, rather than having them pair off in different areas of the aquarium.</p><h2>Harlequin Rasbora Habitat and Care </h2><p>Harlequin rasboras prefer slow-moving, highly vegetated, peaty waterways in the wild. In captivity, start with a dark, sandy or gravely substrate and add some leafy detritus. Also, include plenty of live plants, rocks, and driftwood. Be sure to keep the plants toward the back and sides of the tank to leave room for an active shoal of fish. Keep lights relatively dim, and add some floating vegetation as well.</p><p>In a well-planted aquarium with other docile community fish, harlequin rasboras have been known to breed and live alongside their young with little or no assistance from the aquarist. This is indeed a fun fish to breed, offering beginners and experts alike very satisfying results.</p><h2>Harlequin Rasbora Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Rasboras are not picky eaters and enjoy a varied diet of high-quality flakes or granules and live foods such as daphnia and artemia. You can supplement this diet with meaty options such as freeze-dried bloodworms or tubifex worms. Rasbora also enjoy frequent treats of fresh vegetables.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male and female rasboras are roughly the same size, but the sexes are easily distinguished. Males have much more red coloring in the dorsal and caudal fins as well as in the caudal peduncle region. The female is more of a golden hue, and when full of roe, her belly is deeper than that of her mate.</p><h2>Breeding the Harlequin Rasbora </h2><p>To breed harlequin rasboras, first set up a separate breeding tank that includes broad-leafed cryptocoryne plants, the rasbora's favorite location for laying eggs in its natural environment.</p><p>Next, place a well-conditioned adult male with a female, heavy with roe, in the breeding tank late in the day. Courtship begins early the next morning; it is initiated by the male and includes the usual fin-flaring and dancing. The pair starts swimming together, eventually moving under a suitable broad leaf of a plant. Here they turn upside down and deposit a few eggs. They move off to court again before coming back to spawn again, which will probably take place on the same plant, or even the same leaf.</p><p>A healthy pair will have deposited 25 to 100 eggs. Rasboras are not avid egg eaters, but they will eat some of the eggs occasionally. Therefore, it's a good idea to remove the parents as soon as breeding has concluded.</p><p>The fry hatch in about 24 hours and are free-swimming on the third day. At this point, feed them infusoria or liquid fry food or an egg yolk squeezed through a cheesecloth for the first week. Then, wean them slowly onto baby brine shrimp and commercial dry ground fry food. Harlequin rasboras grow extremely fast and have reached adult size within three months if fed well and often. Add a sponge filter after the first week, and change 10 percent of the water every week after the first month.</p>",931

A large school makes an aquarium vivid and vibrant with movement. This is a great fish for a smaller-sized community tank as it is peaceable with most other species. It is a smaller fish, so keep it with like-sized specimens; larger fish might be attracted by its shimmer and try to make a meal out of it.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Red rasbora</p><p>Adult Size: 1.75 inches (4.5 centimeters)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The harlequin rasbora is a native of Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, and southern Thailand. It inhabits streams and waters that are characterized principally by their low mineral content and high concentrations of dissolved humic acids, which is typical of water that flows through swamped forests. The waterlogged soils of these forests inhibit the complete decay of leaf litter, resulting in the formation of peat, which leaches humic acids. These conditions resemble those found in the blackwater habitats of South America.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Of the more than five dozen species of rasbora, the harlequin is arguably the most popular of them all. Often referred to as a red rasbora, the body is a reddish-copper color that is accented by a striking black wedge covering the rear half of the body. The distinguishing triangular patch begins near the dorsal fin and comes to a point near the base of the caudal fin. This species looks similar to and.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The harlequin rasbora is a shoaling fish; it should be kept in schools of eight to 10 individuals. Schools of even larger numbers make for a beautiful display. You can keep harlequins with any fish as long it's not large and predatory. It will not nip at or quarrel with any other species. Some potentially good tankmates may include cardinal tetras, bettas, neon tetras, small barbs, dwarf gouramis, danios, other small rasboras, and cory catfish.</p><h2>Harlequin Rasbora Habitat and Care </h2><p>Rasboras are a true freshwater family of fish and are never seen in brackish waters. They prefer the lowland waters of southeastern Asia, where the water is soft and acidic. Harlequins prefer an environment with areas of dense vegetation, an open area for swimming, a dark substrate, and subdued lighting.</p><p>An aquarium intended to house harlequin rasboras should be planted with live plants. Create open areas for swimming between stands of plants such as  species, these being among the plants that inhabit the harlequin rasbora's native waters.</p><h2>Harlequin Rasbora Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Harlequins readily accept all foods but prefer to eat live foods whenever possible. In nature, their diet consists primarily of insects. However, they will accept frozen foods and freeze-dried foods as well as flake foods. A varied diet will ensure that digestive problems or susceptibility to disease do not occur. Brine shrimp, daphnia, and any type of worm are excellent supplemental foods, particularly when conditioning before breeding.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male harlequins are more slender than females and exhibit a rounded extension at the bottom edge of the distinctive black wedge covering the posterior of the fish. The black wedge on females is perfectly straight. The female harlequin rasbora is also larger than the male.</p><h2>Breeding the Harlequin Rasbora </h2><p>Harlequins are among the more difficult tropical freshwater species to breed, however, spawning may be achieved if you provide the proper conditions. Select young specimens and condition them with live foods such as daphnia and mosquito larvae before the spawning attempt. Harlequin rasbora differs from other popular rasboras in the aquarium when it comes to breeding. While other rasboras are egg-scattering spawners, harlequin rasboras are egg layers.</p><p>You can breed groups of young harlequins in a single aquarium. When spawned in groups, keep two males for every female. Hobbyists who are intent upon simulating natural conditions as closely as possible may choose to filter the aquarium water over peat, thus replicating the humic acid concentrations found in the fish's native waters, although this is not necessary if the basic water chemistry parameters (no higher than 4 dGH of hardness, pH around 6.4) are correctly maintained. Optimum water temperatures for spawning are between 76 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Add Cryptocorynes or similar broad-leafed plants to the breeding tank.</p><p>Once you prepare the breeding tank, introduce the breeding stock late in the day. Spawning will usually begin in the morning and is initiated by the male dancing and trembling before the female. This spawning behavior is intended to direct the female beneath a suitable plant for depositing the eggs. You may see the male nudging the sides of the female and rubbing his belly against her back to move her to the spawning location.</p><p>When ready to spawn, the female will turn upside down and rub her belly against the underside of a leaf, signaling the male to join her. The male will approach her while continuing to tremble, then wrap himself around her body and fertilize the eggs as they are released. Six to 12 eggs are laid at a time. The fertilized eggs rise and adhere to the underside of the leaves. During one to two hours, as many as 300 eggs may be laid, although, 80 to 100 is more typical.</p><p>When spawning is complete, remove the breeding stock from the aquarium, as they will consume the fry once they hatch. In water temperatures of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the eggs will hatch in approximately 24 hours. The fry is translucent and remains attached to the leaf upon which the eggs were laid for another 12 to 24 hours, during which time the yolk sac is absorbed.</p><p>Once this process is completed, the fry become free-swimming, and at this stage, require very finely sized foods such as live infusoria for a period of seven to 14 days, after which the fry can feed upon newly hatched brine shrimp. If infusoria are unavailable, commercially prepared foods for an egglayer may also be used. Young harlequin rasboras then reach sexual maturity in approximately six to nine months.</p>",981
18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guppy-fish-species-profile-5078901,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Guppy Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Guppy Fish Species Profile</h1><p>Guppies have been a staple of the aquarium hobby for generations. Originating in tropical pools in South America and the Caribbean Islands, these fish are now available in a wide variety of colors that have been produced by selective breeding at fish farms. Many guppy keepers may start out with only one or two fish, but being live-bearers with long-term sperm storage, you may be in for a full tank before long.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Guppy </p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 3 years</p><h2>Origins and Distribution </h2><p>The guppy has been captive bred for over 100 years, but originally came from South America. They are named for Robert John Lechmere Guppy who collected these fish on the island of Trinidad in 1866. They are native to freshwater streams in the north of South America, including Surinam, Guyana and Venezuela, and the Caribbean islands, including Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago. Now, they have been introduced to every continent but Antarctica and can be found in many warm waterways around the world</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>There are countless color varieties of guppies. Males have more vibrant colors than females, and have longer caudal and dorsal fins. Depending on the variety, some guppies have short, rounded tails, some ""V""-shaped and others can have an elongated tail half the length of their body. Tail fins may have a marbled or striped appearance, or the fish may be all one or two colors. Whatever color combination you can dream, there is probably a perfect guppy for you.</p><p>Many websites and some pet stores will offer ""select"" or ""unique"" varieties found nowhere else. Many times, these strains are the result of serious inbreeding and produce fish with compromised immune function and shorter life spans. Try to stick to the mainstream varieties with well-established lineages. If you end up breeding two different strains, you may be surprised how the color variations mix.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Guppies are peaceful, easy-going community fish and play well with a mix of other non-aggressive fish species. You may want to keep them with similar, live-bearing fish, such as platys or mollies. Other good tankmates include small fish such as neon tetras or zebra fish. Keep in mind that any fry spawned from an active guppy female may be dinner for other fish in the tank, so having smaller tankmates will ensure more fry survive.</p><p>Many guppy keepers often opt for a guppy-only aquarium. You are welcome to mix different varieties of guppy in the same tank.</p><h2>Guppy Habitat and Care </h2><p>Guppies are great beginner fish. They are low maintenance and can tolerate some beginner mistakes. A bigger tank size is recommended since guppies are very active fish. They thrive in an aquarium with plants and soft décor items.</p><p>In order to keep your population from exploding, it is strongly recommended that you separate males and females in different tanks. That will help prevent a population explosion. Guppy females can store sperm for multiple spawns, even after separation from males, so once a female has been with a male she may have multiple batches of babies. Tank dividers are okay as a temporary solution, but many of these flimsy, plastic dividers are usually not enough to keep fish separated. Two separate tanks will keep unwanted spawning to zero.</p><h2>Guppy Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Guppies are omnivores and do well on a variety of commercially available feeds. Even though guppies are small in size, pelleted diets, called micropellets, are the best choice since they hold onto their nutrition longer than flakes. You are welcome to add supplements, such as frozen fish foods, but no more than once or twice a week. The complete pelleted diet is best for most pet fish species.</p><p>Depending on your aquarium's temperature, and the other tank inhabitants, you may feed your fish once or twice a day. Always start with a little bit of food, and when it has all been consumed, add a little more. Repeat for a few minutes and use this time to check out all of your fish. Feeding time is a great time to see if any of your fish are acting odd or sick.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are a few gender differences you will need to identify to keep your male and female populations separate. Males tend to be smaller and more vibrantly colored. Females tend to have a brown coloration and are larger and rounder.</p><p>On the underside of the fish, the anal fin of the male is long and thin and tapers to a point. The anal fin on the female guppy is larger and triangular or fan in shape. As the male guppies grow, the body will develop coloration that does not occur on the female's body. Guppies are sexually mature in about 2-3 months, and you should be able to identify the differences between genders by a month of age, if you wish to separate them. Female guppies first produce offspring at 10 20 weeks of age, and they continue to reproduce until 20 34 months of age. </p><h2>Breeding the Guppy </h2><p>Many beginner hobbyists will start with only one female guppy and suddenly have a swarm. Since female guppies can store sperm, it only takes one insemination by a male for a few spawns to be born. In order to prevent your aquarium from maxing out its stocking capacity, it is always best to separate male and female guppies.</p><p>Guppies are live-bearers, so the female will give birth to 10-50 wiggling fry per spawning. Many times, the newly born fry will be eaten by other fish in the aquarium, so if you want to save any fish, keep them in a separate tank or breeding box. Heavily planted aquariums will also give the babies places to hide and survive.</p><p>After breeding together many generations of the same population, you may notice an increased number of fish with congenital abnormalities, such as crooked spines or shortened lifespans. Inbreeding is a common occurrence in isolated fish populations with a simple solution: add more diversity! Many hobbyists will elect to trade fish with a fellow guppy keeper, or you can purchase new fish to add to your aquarium once they have cleared quarantine.</p>",1004

It is a flashy, peaceful fish for a community tank, but in the wild, this man-made shiny coloring would make it quick prey for predators.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: China barb, Chinese barb, Chinese half-striped barb, gold barb, green barb, half banded barb, half-stripes barb, Schubert's barb, six-banded banded barb</p><p>ADULT SIZE: 4 inches (10 cm)</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The gold barb has a steeply-sloped back and short barbels positioned at the corners of the mouth. A number of dark vertical bars or blotches are visible along the flanks of the fish. Well-conditioned specimens may also have red coloration on the fins.</p><p>The naturally occurring color of this barb is green, but the green is rarely seen in the aquarium trade due to the overwhelming popularity of the gold form. Virtually all specimens currently sold are captive-bred, and a few other color variations have subsequently arisen, including an albino variant as well as a tricolor variation.</p><p>This gold form was selectively bred by Thomas Schubert in the 1960s and was at one time thought to be a distinct species, referred to as or . It is now known to be the same species as the wild form.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Gold barbs are schooling fish and should be kept in groups of at least a half-dozen or more. The peaceful nature of this species makes them an excellent choice for community aquariums of other similarly-sized peaceful fish including tetras, danios, and other small barbs.</p><h2>Gold Barb Habitat and Care </h2><p>Gold barbs are quite hardy and undemanding of water conditions or habitat essentials. They originate in free-flowing streams and rivers, so use a powerhead to provide a decent current.</p><p>They should be provided with a good-sized open space for swimming, along with plants, driftwood, or other decors for use as hiding spots. Use a fine-grade substrate, preferably of a darker color to showcase the colors of the fish.</p><h2>Gold Barb Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In their natural habitat, this species lives on a diet of insects and their larva, as well as worms, vegetation, and even detritus. It's a prime example of an omnivore, eating just about anything available. To maintain optimal health, a varied diet is advisable.</p><p>Flake, pellet, freeze-dried and frozen foods will all be readily accepted. When possible, include live foods such as insects, brine shrimp, and worms of all types. Fresh vegetables are an excellent added supplement.</p><h2>Gender Differences  </h2><p>Females are overall much duller in coloration and larger than the male, as well as rounder in the belly. The belly of mature males who are ready to spawn will turn red to red-orange in color.</p><h2>Breeding the Gold Barb </h2><p>Gold barbs are relatively easy to breed, but as with breeding most fish species, a separate breeding tank is recommended. The tank should be well-planted with fine-leafed plants such as java moss. Spawning mops can also be used. A mesh cover could be placed over the bottom of the tank to allow the eggs to fall through.</p><p>Regardless of which medium is used for spawning, make sure there are plenty of hiding spots for the female, as the male can be quite aggressive during the spawning process. Lighting should be dim, and the water should be soft at about 8 dGH, with a pH between 6 and 7. Use a sponge filter with a very gentle flow.</p><p>Spawning can be attempted with pairs or by using the group method. When spawning in a group, use a half-dozen of each sex. If spawning in pairs, maintain separate tanks of males and females. Select the plumpest female and most brightly colored male, and introduce them to the spawning tank late in the day. Prior to spawning with either method, condition the breeders for several days with live foods.</p><p>Typically, spawning occurs in the early morning around dawn. Males will begin to circle the female, nudging her in order to position her near the area he has selected for spawning. The female will release up to 300 eggs, which will then be fertilized by the male. Adults will readily eat the eggs, so as soon as the eggs have been fertilized, the adults should be removed from the tank.</p><p>The pale yellow eggs will hatch in about 48 hours, and the fry (baby fish) will be free swimming in a few days. Feed the fry on infusoria, fine fry food, and freshly hatched brine shrimp. Both the eggs and fry are rather sensitive to light, so keep the tank as dark as possible until the fry are several weeks old.</p>",787

Originating in the rivers of Guyana, it is easygoing and peaceful and can survive in a fairly wide range of aquarium environments. Because they are schooling fish, you'll want to keep at least six glowlight tetras.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Glowlight tetra, glolight, fire neon</p><p>Adult Size: 1.5 inches (4 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Egg scatterer</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The glowlight tetra's origins are in the Essequibo basin in Guyana; they have been found in the Essequibo, Mazaruni, and Potaro Rivers. The river waters of South America are stained with tannins from plant matter decay which make them naturally soft and acidic.</p><p>The fish was originally named , but that was changed to the current name, . However, scientists continue to debate whether this fish should be moved to the genus Cheirodon.</p><p>The glowlight tetra is bred in captivity, and it is exported from both Asia and Germany. It was introduced to the aquarium trade in 1933.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Peaceful and easy to care for, the glowlight tetra is one of the most popular of all tetras. Small and slender, they reach an adult size of only an inch and a half in length. The translucent, silvery-peach colored body of the glowlight tetra is divided by an iridescent red-gold stripe running from snout to tail. The stripe resembles the glowing filament in a light bulb or glowlight. The same iridescent red color is present on the leading edge of the dorsal fin while the anal and pelvic fins are edged in white.</p><p>The trademark stripe of the glowlight tetra is shared by a species of rasbora, known as the red line or glowlight rasbora, and the two fish are sometimes confused. However, the two species are not from the same genus. The most obvious difference between the two is the lack of an adipose fin in the rasbora.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Glowlight tetras like their own kind; keep them in groups of at least a half-dozen or more. You can also keep them with other small peaceful fish, including other small tetras, barbs, danios, cory catfish, and peaceful loaches. Although they are a schooling fish, they will generally not school together with other species. This is true even with species of similar size and shape, such as the neon and cardinal tetra. Slow-moving fish and fish with long fins are safe with glowlight tetras.</p><p>However, avoid angelfish as they eat glowlights. Avoid all large fish as well as predatory species. Additionally, any fish that are extremely active may prove stressful for the glowlight tetra.</p><h2>Glowlight Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Glowlight tetras are most attractive and also most comfortable when kept in a darkened tank. Choose a dark substrate and provide plenty of vegetation, but leave some open space for swimming. Add tannins to both soften and darken the water, and add floating plants to provide the finishing touch to the perfect glowlight tetra habitat. Glowlight tetras tolerate a wider range of water parameters than similar tetras.</p><h2>Glowlight Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Glowlights are omnivorous so they will eat all types of foods. It's important to feed small-sized food and to vary the diet. They readily accept flakes, freeze-dried, and frozen foods in addition to live foods. Micro-pellet foods are suitable as well as any good quality flake that has been crumbled into fine pieces. Frozen or fresh brine shrimp is readily accepted too. Glowlights will rarely eat food that has fallen to the bottom, so feed small quantities frequently, as opposed to less frequent large feedings.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Female glowlights are larger-bodied and plumper than males. The males are generally smaller and more slender, particularly in the abdomen. Bellies are more rounded in the female.</p><h2>Breeding the Glowlight Tetra </h2><p>Glowlight tetras have been successfully bred in the aquarium, but the process is known to be somewhat challenging. Prepare a separate breeding tank with very soft water of no more than 6 dGH and pH of 5.5 to 7.0; use peat to soften and darken the water. Keep the breeder temperature warm, in the range of 78 82 F (26 28 C). Low lighting in the tank is necessary; ambient light from the room is sufficient. Plant the tank with fine-leafed plants, such as java moss; a spawning mop is also suitable in lieu of moss.</p><p>Condition your school with three to five small feedings per day. Vary the diet, including live foods whenever possible. When a female becomes very plump, place her and a male in the breeding tank. When the pair is ready to spawn, the male will dart about the tank after the female, ultimately performing a courtship display in which he flicks his fins and shimmies near the female. When courtship culminates, both fish roll on their backs, the female ejects her eggs and the male fertilizes them.</p><p>A typical spawning will produce between 100 and 150 eggs. The parents provide no parental care and will eat the eggs if they get the opportunity, so remove them as soon as spawning is complete. Many breeders place a spawning grate on the tank bottom to protect eggs from being eaten.</p><p>The eggs are extremely light-sensitive, so keep the rearing tank dark. Hatching occurs in approximately one day, and the fry become free-swimming in three. At two weeks of age, the fry show silver coloration. At three weeks they begin to show the trademark glow line through the middle of the body.</p><p>Initially, feed fry on infusoria or paramecium cultures, and then on finely crushed flake food. Within a few days, you can feed them freshly hatched brine shrimp. Add micro worms to their diet once they grow a bit larger. </p>",939

The Malabar Danio was once considered the same species, but it has since been re-identified as a separate but closely related species.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Aptly named the giant danio, this deep-bodied species can reach four inches in length and even larger in its natural habitat. The body is iridescent gold with steel-blue-colored spots and stripes running lengthwise from the gills to the tail. The fins are pale golden in color and rounded, while the tail fin is forked. There are several color variations, including an albino.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Due to its size, the giant danio is not well suited to being kept with smaller fish. The rule of thumb is not to combine small fish with any fish large enough to swallow them. Small characins would be at risk, but medium to large characins may be suitable. Any medium- to large-sized bottom-dwelling fish will also do well with giant danios.</p><p>Slow-moving fish, such as angelfish or bettas, are not suitable as tankmates with giant danios. These little giants make excellent additions to cichlid tanks, as long as the cichlid species you have are not overly aggressive. Giant danios should always be kept in a school of a half dozen at a minimum, preferably more. Smaller numbers often result in aggressive behavior toward other fish and even toward one another.</p><h2>Giant Danio Habitat and Care </h2><p>Giant danios are active and swim rapidly throughout the tank, preferring the upper levels of the aquarium. They are a schooling fish and should never be kept by themselves.</p><p>The size and activity level of this species requires a roomy aquarium to provide sufficient swimming space. Although a 55-gallon tank is the recommended minimum size, it is possible to keep them in a 30- or 40-gallon tank if it is the long, horizontal variety. Any tank under 36 inches in length is simply too small to comfortably keep giant danios.</p><p>Because they have a tendency to jump, keep the tank kept well covered at all times. Filtration should be sufficient to provide a steady flow of water and maintain good water quality. Decor to mimic a river or stream habitat is ideal but not required. To mimic their natural hill stream environment, use river gravel or sand, minimal driftwood, and sturdy plants, such as anubias, only along the periphery of the tank; leave the tank mostly open, with large, long areas for swimming.</p><h2>Giant Danio Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Giant danios are omnivorous and will accept a wide range of foods, including flake, freeze-dried, frozen, and live foods. To bring out the best coloration, offer live foods, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, or mosquito larvae. If live foods are not available, substitute the frozen counterpart. Occasionally include vegetable flakes in their feedings to provide a well-balanced diet.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Females are attractively colored but generally are less vivid than the males. The body is iridescent gold with steel-blue-colored spots and stripes running lengthwise from the gills to the tail. In females, the stripes bend upward at the base of the tail, while in males the stripe runs straight, extending through the tail. The abdomen of the female is fuller and rounder than that of the male. Males are also noticeably slimmer than their female counterparts.</p><h2>Breeding the Giant Danio </h2><p>Giant danios are relatively easy to breed, and the fry are fairly easy to raise. Spawning should be attempted in a roomy tank that has some exposure to the sun if possible, as natural sunlight triggers spawning. Keep the water warm, in the range of 77 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 28 degrees Celsius), with a pH of 7.0 or below. Provide fine-leafed plants, such as java moss, or a spawning mop. Condition the breeder pair with live foods such as brine shrimp.</p><p>During spawning, up to 20 eggs are produced during each pairing, which continues until as many as 300 are scattered on the plants or spawning mop. Remove the breeding pair once the eggs are laid, as the parents will consume the eggs and fry. Eggs hatch in 24 to 36 hours and the fry become free-swimming approximately 48 hours later. Feed the fry commercially prepared fine fry foods or freshly hatched brine shrimp.</p>",891

Unlike many other species of cichlid, the German Blue Ram is a peaceful and easygoing community member. These fish are not recommended for the beginner or intermediate hobbyist due to their strict water quality requirements and habitat desires.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: German Blue Ram, Ram Chiclid, German Blue</p><p>Adult Size: 2 to 3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 3 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Like many other cichlid species, the German Blue Ram or Ram Cichlid is native to South America. This species is found in the Orinoco River basin in both Venezuela and Colombia. It has been bred successfully in captivity for many years, protecting wild populations.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The German Blue Ram is distinctive with its vivid blue accents. The base color of the body is gold/silver, with black markings over the head, cranial dorsal fin, and spots on the dorsal side-body. The fins may be slightly red or orange at their tips. The entire body is highlighted by vibrant patches of reflective electric blue, giving this fish its name.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Unlike many other cichlid species, the German Blue Ram is a relatively peaceful fish, and therefore not well suited to many combination cichlid species tanks. Provided their water quality parameters match, the German Blue Ram can be kept with many other compatible community aquarium fish species.</p><p>Other potential cichlid companions for the German Blue Ram include the Blood Parrot Cichlid or Kribensis Cichlid. There are many more aggressive cichlid species that are not recommended to be kept with the German Blue Ram.</p><h2>German Blue Ram Habitat and Care </h2><p>The German Blue Ram is recommended only for advanced hobbyists due to its finicky water quality requirements and desired habitat. It is critical to maintain good water quality for any fish system, but extra important to keep your German Blue Ram alive and healthy. Stick to a regular maintenance schedule and test your water quality regularly.</p><p>In addition to exceptional water quality, this species likes to have plants to swim around, caves to hide in, and if you plan on breeding, flat stones for females to lay their eggs.</p><p>Too many plants will hinder your fish's ability to swim freely and not enough caves may lead to unnecessary competition between cave-loving species. It is a delicate balance to create an environment where your fish has room to swim and safely hide.</p><h2>German Blue Ram Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Being omnivores and not very picky eaters, a balanced cichlid pellet is the best choice for German Blue Ram. Supplements with frozen, fresh or dried diets are welcome on an occasional basis, but should not make up more than 5-10% of the overall diet. These can be both carnivore and herbivore treats.</p><p>Being easygoing fish, there are no specific feeding requirements for the German Blue Ram. As with all community tanks, a broadcast feeding is recommended so all fish get a fair share.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>It is very difficult to differentiate between male and female rams. The males tend to be larger and more colorful, but external variations are not a consistent method of sex differentiation.</p><p>For some individuals, if you carefully look at the black spots on the side of your German Blue Ram, the males will not have any blue coloration in their black spots, whereas the females will. The males also tend to have an elongated dorsal fin. However, these are not guaranteed methods of sex determination.</p><h2>Breeding the German Blue Ram </h2><p>It is highly suggested that all attempts at fish breeding occur in a separate breeding tank. This will allow for slight variations in water quality and temperature while protecting the newly hatched fry.</p><p>The German Blue Ram prefers to breed in slightly acidic (5.5-6.5), soft water, and slowly increase the temperature to the top of the range (82F or 28C). Breeding has high metabolic requirements, so make sure your fish are well fed prior to moving them into their new surroundings.</p><p>Once you have an established male-female pair of German Blue Rams, they will tend to school together. They will require a flat rock on which the female will lay her eggs, then the male will follow behind to fertilize them. The parents will take turns guarding the eggs and newly hatched fry.</p>",712
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/forktailed-rainbow-fish-4071595,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Forktailed Rainbowfish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Forktailed Rainbowfish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The forktailed rainbowfish, is easy to breed, beautifully colored and relatively hardy. Less than two inches when fully grown, this small rainbowfish fits in well with other small shoaling fish in a well-planted community aquarium. Providing that this fish is transferred over to its new aquarium home slowly, it will adapt to a wide range of water conditions ranging from soft and slightly acidic water to hard and alkaline.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Forktailed rainbow fish, forktail blue eye</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origins and Distribution </h2><p>Forktailed rainbowfish are native to Peria Creek and the Kwagira River of eastern Papua New Guinea; they exist in the wild in only a very small geographic area in Milne Bay Province. They occasionally travel into nearby rivers and tributaries, probably as a result of drainage among the different waterways.</p><p>These fish prefer slow-moving streams lined with heavy vegetation; these environments make it easy for them to find their favorite foods: zooplankton, phytoplankton, and invertebrates. Very few forktailed rainbowfish are collected in the wild. Because they are easy to breed, they are bred at fish farms for the aquarium trade.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The forktailed rainbowfishis a very attractive species with blue eyes, a silvery body, and bright yellow stripes on the top and bottom of the body in the breeding season. Two upturned almost wing-like pectoral fins, bright yellow in color along with bright yellow dorsal fins in breeding season make these little gems great additions to any community aquarium.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Forktailed rainbowfish are a shoaling species and should be kept with six to ten of their own kind. A generally peaceful fish, they can live comfortably with smaller goby or catfish species, danios, tetras, rasboras, dwarf cichlids, and other small rainbowfish. Do avoid keeping this species in a tank with slower-moving fish or fish with long, trailing fins as they do sometimes nip and can be a bit aggressive.</p><h2>Forktailed Rainbowfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>When creating a habitat for your forktailed rainbowfish, remember that their native environment is one of slow-moving water with a great deal of vegetation. To recreate a similar habitat, choose a 30-gallon or larger aquarium and add a dark, sandy or rocky substrate.</p><p>Decorate with river rocks, driftwoods, rooted plants, and floating feathery-leafed plants.  Floating plants over a dark substrate will not only bring out the colors in this species to the best effect, but the fish will be more comfortable and calm. Live plants are necessary for this fish to thrive. Be sure the water is well oxygenated. Use a large filtration system but one that doesn't create too much turbulence.</p><p>The forktailed rainbowfish is very active; it is not only fast but agile as well, swimming, twisting, and turning in and out of plants playfully. They are a middle zone fish and are in motion as long as aquarium lights are on. It is best to keep two males together with four to six females to induce the most active social displays. Forktailed rainbowfish need many hours to acclimatize to a new aquarium environment. Quick exposure to different water chemistry and temperature can shock their systems.</p><h2>Forktailed Rainbowfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>A great advantage of the forktailed rainbowfish is their uncomplicated feeding requirement: they have almost no special needs. Choose flake, micropellets, and small frozen foods such as daphnia, baby brine shrimp ( nauplii), and cyclops.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male forktailed rainbowfish can be distinguished by their sharper colors and a striking fin shape; fins are curved and almost wing-like and are bright yellow. Females and juveniles have the same basic coloring as males, but the colors are not as brilliant.</p><h2>Breeding the Forktailed Rainbowfish </h2><p>These fish are short-lived in nature so they mature quickly, and breed young. Males are prime at about eight months; after one year to 15 months, they will develop a pigeon chest, at which time they are too old or mature to breed. However, many forktailed rainbowfish do live to be very old fish in a community aquarium.</p><p>This speciesusually mates within the shoal and lays their eggs among feathery-leafed plants. Over the last 10 years, this remarkable member of the rainbowfish family has faded almost completely from the home aquarium scene. It is unfortunate, because not only is this remarkable fish one of the easiest of the rainbowfish to keep in a community aquarium, it is also one of the easiest of its kind to breed.</p><p>Using two males and six females, each male will set up his own ""territory"" in the well-planted breeding tank. One of the males will take possession of a fine-leaved plant or breeding mop at a far end of the tank. You will notice that the females will stay in the middle of the aquarium during this mating ritual; the other male may take possession of another plant of the breeding mop at the other end of the tank. </p><p>You must get up at sunrise, or cause the lighting system in the breeding tank to simulate dawn, which is when the males will display for the females. This is worth getting up for as they become quite beautiful in their dances. Occasionally the males may have a brief skirmish for dominance, but they tend to ignore each other.</p><p>Eventually, a female will follow one of the males back to his chosen plant or breeding mop to spawn. You will know they are spawning when they dip to the lower reaches of the tank and swim up into the plant or mop close to each other. As they reach close to the top of the plant, they swim into each other and release eggs and milt together.</p><p>The most difficult part about breeding this remarkable fish is the wait for the eggs to hatch as it will take at least 14 days. Because of this delay, there is a real chance of losing the eggs to fungus if left in the breeding tank. Remove the eggs to a sterile water tank with fungus treatment to achieve the best results.</p><p>The fry (baby fish) of this species are unusual among the smaller egg-layers as they are free-swimming and self-sufficient at the time of hatching. They are immediately large enough to eat live baby brine shrimp and powdered dry food.</p><p>Use a sponge filter in the fry rearing tank after three weeks, change 20 percent of the water each week, and feed small amounts of varying foods six times a day. With luck and good attention to detail, at three months they will be over an inch long.</p>",1057
64,https://www.thesprucepets.com/flower-horn-fish-5196087,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Flower Horn: Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Flower Horn: Fish Species Profile</h1><p>The Flower Horn Cichlid is a hybrid variety of South American cichlids with a distinctive bulbous forehead. Although easy to care for, these fish can be very aggressive towards other fish. They like to root around in their substrate and redecorate their tanks frequently.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Flower Horn Cichlid</p><p>Scientific Name: hybrid</p><p>Adult Size: 10-12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 10 years</p><p>Tank Size: 70-100 gallons</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Flower Horn has a very unique beginning and is not found in the wild. However, it has been mistakenly introduced into wild sites and is able to reproduce. It is at risk of becoming an invasive species if it outcompetes native species for food and space.</p><p>This hybrid species was created by cichlid hobbyists cross-breeding various Central American cichlid species. It is suspected the Flower Horn came from a cross of a Blood Parrot Cichlid, another hybrid species, and a Red Devil Cichlid, but this is not verifiable. They are common in the hobby and some can produce viable offspring from a mated pair.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Flower Horns are most recognizable for the large hump on their foreheads. This structure is called a nuchal hump or kok and usually more distinctive on male Flower Horns.</p><p>There are a few varieties of Flower Horns available in the commercial market. The most common and most recognizable is the Red Dragon Flower Horn. The juvenile Red Dragon is typically silver with some dark spots along the body. As the fish matures, the coloration changes to a bright red. Typically, fish will have a marbled pattern of red with white and/or black patches. Other varieties are lighter in color, ranging from tan to yellow instead of red.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Given their slightly aggressive nature and large body size, it is hard to find a good match for the Flower Horn. The best tank mate is another Flowerhorn, preferably a mated pair. Both males and females can be aggressive towards others of their own species. For two Flowerhorns, you will need a 150-gallon tank.</p><p>Some additional, larger fish that can stand their own against the Flower Horn include the Oscar Cichlid and the Suckermouth Catfish.</p><h2>Flower Horn Habitat and Care </h2><p>Flower Horns tend to be a little rough on their habitats. Many Flower Horn tanks tend to be slightly bare due to the destructive and curious nature of these fish. They are known to dig up plant roots, overturn driftwood, and even move large rocks. Rather than punish normal fish behavior and take their toys away, allow them to decorate their tank as they see fit. These are very curious, almost playful, fish that appreciate enrichment from various décor items. Stick to soft substrate to keep your Flower Horn from causing too much trauma to their skin as they root around.</p><p>Given their large tank requirement and tendency to not play well with others, Flower Horn tanks tend to be easier to take care of. Be sure to choose a filter to keep up with your larger tank and be sure to stick to a regular maintenance schedule.</p><h2>Flower Horn Diet and Feeding </h2><p>These hybrid cichlids are omnivorous and well accustomed to eating pelleted and other prepared foods. Choose a large cichlid pellet to anchor their diet and then you can supplement with both vegetable and meaty treats. Flower Horns have a very healthy appetite and can be overfed if owners are not paying attention to their diet. Treats should be given once or twice a week at most. Given their warmer water preference, twice a day feeding minimum is required.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>It can be difficult to tell male from female Flower Horns. The large forehead bump may be more distinctive in males, but this feature can fluctuate in size rapidly over a few days, and some males do not have one. Males also tend to be larger than females, but it will depend on a fish's underlying genetics and diet.</p><p>If you are able to look at your fish's vent when they are fully mature, female Flower Horns will have a ""U""-shaped ovipositor in their vent, whereas the males will have a ""V""-shaped genital papilla in their vent. As described, this can be very hard for some to differentiate, but is the only way to verify a mating pair.</p><h2>Breeding the Flower Horn </h2><p>Although some of these hybrids produce viable offspring, there is no guarantee that your fish will be able to do the same. There are many known cases of Flower Horns that are unable to spawn, even with all the right conditions.</p><p>To attempt a spawning, you will need to move your mating pair to a separate spawning tank. After breeding, move your female fish back to their main tank as the male cares for the eggs. It is recommended that the spawning tank contain a few smooth rocks for the female to lay the eggs on, and no substrate.</p><p>Temperature manipulation is not often necessary to stimulate breeding, but raising your aquarium water a few degrees can help. After spawning, the fry will hatch in a few days. Once they hatch, the male can rejoin the female in the main tank. Be sure to feed a diet high in protein and fat to encourage proper development. The fry must be fed fine particle foods several time per day.</p>",876
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/flame-tetra-1380991,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Flame Tetra (Von Rio Tetra) Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Flame Tetra (Von Rio Tetra) Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>Moto ""Club4AG"" Miwa / Flickr / CC BY-SA 2.0</p><p>The flame tetra, or Von Rio tetra, is one of the most entrancing beauties of all freshwater aquarium fish, especially when it is sporting its full breeding colors. At one time, almost no community aquarium was complete without this fish. During the 1940s and 1950s, it was among the best sellers of all characin fish. One reason for its overwhelming popularity was its ability to survive in a wide temperature range. Before the days of affordable heating for the home aquarium, this went a long way towards making it the first choice as a first fish.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Flame tetra, Von Rio tetra, fire tetra, red tetra</p><p>Adult Size: 1.6 inches (4 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 to 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Flame tetras are found in South America in the coastal rivers of eastern Brazil and around Rio de Janeiro in the Guanabara bay region, Paraiba do Sul, and the Guandu River basins as well as Sao Paulo in the upper Tiete River basin. These tetras prefer slow-flowing creeks, river tributaries, and backwaters. Flame tetras were first imported to Europe in 1920 and to the United States soon afterward. </p><p>For some reason, this seemingly eternal community aquarium favorite waned in popularity over the last quarter of the 1900s and was almost rare at the turn of the millennium. Its popularity is again growing, and the Von Rio tetra can now be found at most tropical fish retailers.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>This fish's body is elongated, slightly compressed, and is shiny silver in color. Its sides are bronze to red, and its back is brilliant red as are the majority of its fins. The anal fin has a black leading edge and tip.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Flame tetras are extremely peaceful in nature. They are happiest in schools of six or more. Other potential tankmates for flame tetras are most of the livebearers, danios, rasboras, other tetras, and peaceful bottom dwellers.</p><h2>Flame Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>One reason flame tetras were popular was their ability to survive in temperatures as low as 64 and as high as 85 degreed Fahrenheit, while they prefer temperatures of around 72 degrees. Also, this fish accepts very low light situations; dim lighting will actually develop this fish's best coloring. </p><p>Flame tetras prefer some plant cover and darker gravel. For the substrate, use river sand with some driftwood and twisted roots. Add some dried leaves to the sand, which will stain the water a light brown. Replace the leaves every few weeks.</p><h2>Flame Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Another amazing attribute of this fish is its ability to eat almost anything. Since they are omnivorous, the flame tetra will generally eat all kinds of living, fresh, and flake foods. Feed brine shrimp (either live or frozen) or blood worms as a treat. Feed this fish several times a day and only feed what this fish can consume in three minutes or less.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>The two sexes of the flame tetra are much alike, both in color and shape. The male has a tiny hook on his anal fin, which can catch on a fine mesh net. If this happens, great care must be taken not to break the hook off in the net. This hook is used for mating.</p><p>The male is smaller and its anal fin is distinctly edged with black. Its body is somewhat pudgy, tapering to the tail, which expands into a considerable caudal fin. The male colors, in prime conditions, are pearly lilac on the forward belly with yellow glints in an indistinct horizontal line to the tail. On each side of the forward part of the body are two dark spots, one behind the other, that look like smudges.</p><p>The lower abdomen and the anal, dorsal, and caudal fins, rather than being exactly flame-colored, are suffused with flame coloring. The contrast between males and females is even clearer when the male turns almost totally bright flame red</p><p>Many observe a point in the anal fin of the female, but this is not definitive or consistent from fish to fish. Further, there is a broad, black border to the anal fin of the male; this border is either completely absent in the female or simply narrower and lighter in tone.</p><p>The female's belly region is thicker and rounder, which makes them deeper in the body than the slimmer males. At breeding time, the females will be very plump with eggs.</p><h2>Breeding the Flame Tetra </h2><p>Another prime reason for this fish's popularity is its ease in breeding. It breeds in a small tank; it has no particular need for freshwater; it spawns up to 500 eggs, and the young are quite hardy. When breeding tetras, great care must be taken to find specimens with good body shape and the ones that are most red in appearance.</p><p>While breeding live-bearers is easier overall, this fish is usually so easy to breed that it is the recommended species for the beginner who is breeding an egg-layer for the first time. The breeding tank can be a 10-gallon tank planted with thickets of small-leaved plants; if possible, use Java moss. Keep females isolated from the male, and condition both tanks on live food for a week. The temperature of the spawning tank should be brought up to around 80 degrees Fahrenheit before introducing the well-conditioned female.</p><p>Introduce the female in the afternoon, followed by the male about one hour before dark. Breeding will probably take place soon after dawn the next morning. The hook in the anal fin of the male is used to hold the female close as the female deposits eggs on a fine leafed plant. If the male fish has lost this hook, the fertility rate of the eggs might be low.</p><p>After laying anywhere between 150 and 500 eggs, the parents may want to feed on the eggs. It is important to remove the breeding pair immediately after spawning. Eggs hatch within 24 to 48 hours. Fry hang on the plants and on the glass of the tank for about two days. They are free-swimming by the third day.</p><p>The fry should be fed infusoria the first week, and then baby brine shrimp and commercial baby powdered food. They are very hardy in the third week, though they tend to stay toward the bottom of the tank, devouring almost anything. After about four months, they begin to look like their parents and are nearly half-grown. At six months, they can be introduced into a community aquarium as a new shoal of fish.</p>",1060

This fish's bold red/orange color, vertical black stripes on the body, and blue-tipped dorsal and anal fins make this fish the centerpiece of any marine aquarium.</p><p>It is interesting to note the difference in colors and markings of the Flame Angel which change with the zone in which they occur.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Flame Angelfish, Red Angelfish</p><p>Adult Size: About 4 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 7 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Flame Angelfish was first found in the Society Islands in the Pacific but has been seen in tropical waters across the Western Pacific including Belau, the Hawaiian, Marquesas, and Ducie Islands, and the Great Barrier Reef and the Pitcairn group of Islands. These fish live in groups of three to seven individuals, preferring stony coral reefs (particularly finger coral) in clear lagoons. They typically congregate at outer reef slopes at depths of 16 to 82 feet.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Flame Angelfish, like all dwarf angels, has an oval body and rounded fins. They are beautiful fish with bright markings that vary widely depending upon their place of origin.</p><p>Flame Angels found in the Central Pacific area include both the Marshall Islands and Christmas Island varieties. Marshall Island Flame Angels are a more intense red (as opposed to an orange tint), with thicker black bars running vertically down the body. The Christmas Island variety is normally more red/orange in color with thin black bars running vertically down the body.</p><p>The Flame Angels from Cebu are red/orange with blurred black bars and a tint of yellow in between the bars. Those from Tahiti are blood red and possess very little to no yellow. But these fish are rarely collected.</p><p>Hawaiian specimens tend to be larger, having a deeper, more vibrant red color than those of the Indo-Pacific region, which are more orange-red. The fin edges on all species are an almost fluorescent, deep blue-purple color.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Flame Angels can be kept with corals and invertebrates, though they may nip at large polypod stony corals, zoanthids, tridacnid clam mantles, and even some soft coral polyps. Therefore, this fish cannot be completely trusted if these invertebrates are present. Feeding the Flame Angel desirable food will cut down on their need to graze on the coral, limiting the damage they may do.</p><p>They are happiest in mated pairs and small groups. With a single male in the group, they are rarely aggressive toward one another, but males may fight. Other safe tankmates include other semi-aggressive species such as the other dwarf angels, anthias, clownfish, tangs, and large wrasses. They can sometimes share a tank with more aggressive fish as well, so long as the Flame Angels are the larger residents.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Flame Angelfish is considered one of the best choices for aquariums because it usually adapts well to captivity. To thrive, it should be kept in either a 30-gallon live-rock tank or in a 100-gallon tank if there are corals present. Provide plenty of shelter for hiding, along with ample algae for nibbling. Be aware: Copper is lethal to this species, so please do not use any copper-containing decorations or tubing.</p><p>Flame Angelfish are comfortable with moderate lighting and any amount of water movement. They enjoy hanging at all levels of the tank, so don't be surprised if you find them toward the bottom rather than the middle of their habitat.</p><p>When introducing new Flame Angelfish to the tank, do keep them in quarantine for a few days as it's not unusual for these fish to be shipped with pre-existing parasites or disease. Once released, monitor them carefully for signs of abnormal eating and aggression.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>An omnivore that eats both plant and animal fare, the Flame Angelfish should be provided with ample live rock and algae growth. Constant grazing is good for the tank, and this fish is a particularly good brown diatom algae eater. This species will accept most any type of fare suitable for omnivores.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>As with roughly 2 percent of the fish species around the world, over 500 known species, all of the members of this particular species are born female. As they mature, the more dominant, larger, most successful individuals change from female to male through a hormonal conversion. The less dominant of the group remain female. As an effective survival strategy for some insects, some fishes, and some reptiles, a relatively dominant female may convert into a male if the only male in the group dies or is removed. It takes about two months for a complete conversion. To determine which Flame Angelfish in your tank is male, look for the one that is larger with bigger blue streaks on the dorsal and anal fins. </p><h2>Breeding the Flame Angelfish </h2><p>It is very difficult to breed Flame Angelfish. However, these fish have spawned in captivity, and lucky aquarists have succeeded in raising their young.</p><p>Flame Angelfish are spawning fish; they rise through the water column at dusk, releasing both eggs and sperm in a cloud. To encourage spawning, keep your fish in as deep a tank as possible. Use lighting to simulate a natural day-night diurnal environment. Turn off about half of your aquarium lights and then return two hours later to turn off remaining lights. You'll need to do this at the same time each day.</p><p>Once eggs are fertilized, they hatch in about 24 hours. The favored food of Angelfish fry is microscopic algae. </p>",908
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/figure-eight-puffer-fish-tetraodon-biocellatus-1378647,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Figure 8 Puffer Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Figure 8 Puffer Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>Very few people can resist a pufferfish once they've seen one, and the small figure 8 puffer might be one you'd like to bring home to your own freshwater aquarium. Their expressive faces, intelligent curiosity, and propeller-like fins are charming. Pufferfish derive their name from their ability to inflate themselves with water or air when startled. This is a very successful defensive mechanism because it's harder to swallow a fish that's ballooning in size!</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Figure 8 puffer, eyespot pufferfish</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 2 1/2 inches (6 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2> Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The figure 8 puffer originates in the brackish (partial salinity) streams and estuaries of Southeast Asia, including Borneo, the Malaysian peninsula, Sumatra, and Thailand. Although these fish do not breed in captivity, they have not as yet been overfished for the trade and are not considered to be a threatened species. Figure 8 puffers in home aquariums have all been wild-caught, which means it's important for them to be quarantined when they first arrive. Be sure new puffers cannot pass along illness to other fish.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Reaching an adult size of fewer than three inches, Figure 8 puffers are small for pufferfish. They are deep brown in color on the upper portion of the body with white on the underside. Yellow spots and lines are sprinkled throughout the body. The name is derived from the markings on the back of the fish, many of which resemble the shape of a figure 8.</p><p>Even when not startled, all figure 8 puffers have a roly-poly appearance; you can easily spot a well-fed puffer by its rounded belly. Puffers have two pairs of teeth, each of which is fused together, giving it a beak-like appearance. This unusual arrangement of teeth gives it the ability to crush hard materials such as the shells of crustaceans. These teeth grow throughout the life of the fish and must get ground down to keep them from being too long. For this reason, they need hard-shelled foods to help keep their teeth the proper length.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Puffers are not well suited to a community tank because they tend to be aggressive. Ideally, figure 8 puffers should be kept alone or in a large aquarium with only a few other fish that thrive in the same partial-salinity habitat. Owners who have kept them in brackish water find that bumblebee gobies, knight gobies, and mollies are suitable companions. Owners keeping them in freshwater aquariums have reported keeping them with fish such as barbs, ""sharks,"" and tetras. As a rule of thumb, don't expect to successfully keep them in a typical freshwater community tank.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Even puffers that have previously been docile and tolerant can become aggressive as they age, and if they are insufficiently fed. A puffer can turn on its tankmates and chew them to pieces.</p><h2>Figure 8 Puffer Habitat and Care </h2><p>Controversy exists over whether any puffers are actually true freshwater fish. They originate in the fresh waters of Southeast Asia, and although they tolerate brackish or even full saltwater, they may fare better in freshwater. Others have reported the opposite, stating that salinity in the range of 1.005 to 1.008 will significantly extend the lifespan of the figure 8 puffer. Scientific data is lacking on comparative lifespans in captivity when housed in different salinities.</p><p>Filtration should be robust, as figure 8 puffers tend to create a lot of debris when eating. They are sensitive to ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates, and will not do well in a tank that is still going through the start-up cycle. Frequent water changes to maintain pristine water conditions are recommended for this fish.</p><p>Unlike most fish, Figure 8 puffers are able to recognize and respond to their owners, but they can also get bored and listless. As a result, they require ample open space to swim, but they also need places to both hide in and explore. They can be hard on plants, due to aggressively attacking their foods; pieces of food rain down on plants and other aquarium décor. Decorate the tank with sturdy plants, and be aware that you may need to replace them from time to time.</p><h2>Figure 8 Puffer Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The dietary needs of figure 8 puffers are perhaps one of the more demanding aspects of keeping this fish. In nature, they typically eat crustaceans and mollusks. Flake or dried foods do not meet their dietary needs. Instead, they must be fed on meaty and hard-shelled foods such as clams, crayfish, crickets, daphnia, krill, oysters, plankton, scallops, snails, shrimp, and worms.</p><p>Because the nutcracker-like beak of the figure 8 puffer can become overgrown, it is important to include plenty of very hard-shelled foods in their diet to keep the teeth ground down. Tetraodon snails or pond snails are terrific for this purpose. Although live foods are ideal, some owners have had success training their puffer to eat some frozen foods. Be sure to select high-quality frozen foods.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Even for experts, it is nearly impossible to sex out the figure 8 puffers. The most certain way to sex them is to observe the female laying eggs, which is an extremely rare occurrence. Only a few cases of spawning in captivity have ever been reported.</p><h2>Breeding the Figure 8 Puffer </h2><p>Little is known about how to breed figure 8 puffers. On the rare occasions that they have spawned in captivity, they are reported to have laid eggs on a flat surface, such as the substrate. The male guards the eggs for approximately a week until the fry are free-swimming.</p>",930
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fantail-goldfish-fish-5322821,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Fantail Goldfish: Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Fantail Goldfish: Fish Species Profile</h1><p>The fantail goldfish is a common variety of fancy goldfish, known for its double tail. Rather than having one standard tail with a top and bottom caudal fin, these goldfish have been bred to have two top and bottom caudal fins, with the top fin being fused along the top. Take special consideration when keeping fantail goldfish in order to accommodate their impaired swimming ability.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Fantail goldfish, double tail goldfish</p><p>Adult Size: 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Although the original comet goldfish originated from the Crucian Carp in Asia, the fantail goldfish is not found in the wild and has been created through selective breeding by humans. Classified as a variety of ""fancy"" goldfish, the fantail goldfish was created through breeding fish with desired characteristics together over countless generations.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Fantail goldfish are known for their double tails, but also tend to have short bodies and may have elongated pectoral and anal fins. Depending on if your fantail has been bred with other varieties of fancy goldfish, such as orandas, ryukins, or pearlscales, your fantail may take on some characteristics of those other goldfish, such as a small wen (head swelling), tall body, or enlarged coelom. Fantail goldfish are typically orange to white in color but can be red or multicolored if they have been crossed with a shubunkin or ryukin goldfish variety.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>As for other goldfish, these options are the best for selecting tankmates for fantail goldfish.</p><h3>None </h3><p>Some goldfish just do not get along with others, and that is just fine. Goldfish can be kept individually, but still need a large, filtered aquarium for maintaining their best health. Be sure to spend lots of time with a goldfish housed alone and spoil it like the special only child it is.</p><h3>Another Goldfish </h3><p>The best tankmate for a fantail goldfish is another fancy goldfish. It is best to not add another goldfish with a long-body, such as a comet or shubunkin, since they may out-swim your fancy goldfish and get to all the food faster. It is best to choose another fancy goldfish of similar slow swimming ability in order to ensure everyone has a fair share of the food and space.</p><h3>Zebrafish </h3><p>When adding fish to a goldfish tank, the most important aspect to consider is the temperate nature of the aquatic environment. Goldfish are kept at lower temperatures than most tropical fish species, making them incompatible. However, a school of zebrafish (zebra danio) is a great addition to a goldfish tank. They like to be in a group, so be sure to have at least five zebrafish. There are many fin varieties and colors of zebrafish to choose from.</p><h2>Fantail Goldfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Like other goldfish varieties, the fantail goldfish is an easy-going, low maintenance fish. However, as with all other goldfish, they are messier than most other pet fish and will require you to stick to your regular maintenance routine. Given their tail shape, fantail goldfish are not the most efficient swimmers, so do not crowd their environment with lots of décor items. You may see them resting more frequently than other goldfish, so having an open area on the substrate will help them rest more comfortably.</p><h2>Fantail Goldfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>There are many pelleted diets available to feed your fantail goldfish. When choosing a pellet, be sure to choose the correct pellet size for your fish to easily swallow. Since they do not have an acidic stomach, goldfish rely on their grinding molars to crush up their food in order to digest it properly. Most goldfish will require about 32-35% protein, but given their swimming difficulties, fancy goldfish should be on a slightly higher protein level in the diet. Choose a diet with a fat content around 4-5% and replace your food container every 6 months to ensure adequate vitamin C levels. Sinking diets are recommended to help with any fish prone to buoyancy disorders, so they don't gulp air at the surface while eating a floating food.</p><p>Feeding frequency will depend on your tank's temperature. Below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), you should be feeding your goldfish once a day. At 70 degrees Fahrenheit and above, you should be feeding your goldfish twice a day. Sprinkle just enough food for them to eat leisurely for 5 minutes. If you see any uneaten food after feeding time, you are feeding too much. Remove uneaten food from an aquarium to prevent waste accumulation.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Like comet goldfish, fantail goldfish have distinguishable features for males. Breeding tubercles, raised white bumps, will appear on the operculum (gill cover) and leading edge of the pectoral fin in males during spawning season. Females tend to be more round, but with the enlarged belly on Fantails, this is not reliable.</p><h2>Breeding the Fantail Goldfish </h2><p>Goldfish are avid breeders, and even novice fish parents can usually get their goldfish to breed. Be sure to increase your goldfish's protein and fat in the diet prior to breeding to ensure full gonad development. Fantail goldfish should be placed in a breeding tank with one male and one female. Usually, raising the water temperature and introducing live plants will encourage your fish to start breeding. Increasing the spring time daylight length will also encourage spawning, and this can be manipulated with indoor lighting. Once the parents have spawned, remove them from the breeding tank or they will eat the eggs. Feed the babies powdered fry food when they become free-swimming after hatching.</p>",914

Not only is it a handsome, iridescent species with impressive reflective rainbow hues, but it's also a peaceful and hardy fish in a mixed community of South American freshwater fish. Emperor tetras are easy to find and relatively inexpensive.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Emperor tetra, imperial blue rainbow tetra, rainbow tetra</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches (5 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 years</p><h2>Characteristics  </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>These fish are native to the freshwater Atrato and San Juan River basins of Colombia in South America. They frequent areas that are slow-moving, such as small tributaries and streams, where the temperature ranges from 73 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Though the emperor tetra is distributed over a narrow range in the wild, it has become a favorite aquarium pet and is farmed for sale around the world. As of 2014, the IUCN Red List (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) has insufficient data to determine the status of this species in its natural habitat in the wild; more research is needed. In captivity, the species breeds readily.</p><h2>Color and Markings </h2><p>The attractive coloration and elegant fins of the regal emperor tetra leave little doubt why the emperor tetra was given its name. Introduced to home aquaria in 1960, it has become one of the more popular of the tetra family of fishes. </p><p>Fins of both sexes have a yellow hue and are edged in black on the outer periphery; they are red where the fin meets the body. The body of the fish is blue-gray with mauve tones, and it displays an almost iridescent sheen. A dark stripe runs horizontally from head to tail, and the body is lighter in color below the stripe.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A schooling fish, the emperor tetra does best in groups of five or six with a single alpha male, though it can thrive as a mated pair. It is also a peaceful species, and thus ideal for a relatively small community tank though it will be disturbed by more boisterous species.</p><p>Some compatible species include danios, rasboras, other tetras, and peaceful catfish species such as or smaller . Pencil fish and dwarf cichlids are also good choices, especially as they hail from the same general region. You may want to choose species that contrast visually with the colorful emperor tetra to create a palette that pleases the eye.</p><h2>Emperor Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Emperors favor dense vegetation and subdued lighting that mimics the Colombian rivers from which they originate. Dark substrate and a heavily planted tank will go far to make them feel at home; these also provide a gorgeous backdrop to this species' brilliant colors.</p><p>Although peat filtration is recommended, they will thrive in even moderately hard water as long as it is changed frequently to maintain purity. These fish prefer quiet habitats and should only be kept with other peaceful species that share similar water requirements.</p><h2>Emperor Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In the wild, the emperor tetra feeds mainly on worms and crustaceans. Undemanding in terms of their diet, captive emperor tetras will readily accept flake foods, freeze-dried foods, and frozen foods. Live foods such as daphnia, mosquito larvae, and brine shrimp are especially relished and are excellent when conditioning breeding pairs.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Unlike many of the tetra species that have a unisex appearance, male and female emperor tetras are easy to differentiate. The dorsal and caudal fins of the male are noticeably longer and more pointed than the female. Also quite noticeable in the male is an extended ray in the middle of the caudal fin that gives the tail the appearance of a trident. The female is also smaller and plumper in the body than the male.</p><h2>Breeding the Emperor Tetra </h2><p>Schools composed of approximately equal numbers of males and females will eventually yield one or more breeding pairs. Each breeding pair should have their own breeding tank, as the males become quite aggressive when spawning. Separate the male and female from each other for a day or two, and condition with live foods prior to spawning attempts.</p><p>Maintain the water temperature in the breeding tank at 80 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit, with a pH of 7.0. The water should be very soft. Place a spawning mop or some dense floating plants in the tank, and keep the lighting subdued. The breeding tank need not be set up with a substrate or any other decor. This will allow for ease of cleaning as the fry (baby fish) develop.</p><p>Spawning begins at dawn; eggs are laid singly over a period of several hours until fifty to one hundred eggs have been produced. The parents will often consume the eggs so the adults should be removed after spawning has completed. Use a sponge filter in the tank to prevent harm to the fry as they are growing. Perform water changes weekly.</p><p>The fry will hatch in 24 to 48 hours and will eat infusoria or other small foods such as freshly hatched brine shrimp. Water pH should not be allowed to become too acidic, or the developing young may be lost as the result of digestive disturbances.</p>",861

These aggressive fish are happy to graze on many invertebrates and need a lot of room, but this impressive fish will add bold contrast to your fish collection. Watching the amazing color transition from juvenile to adult makes this a unique marine fish and a memorable experience for many fish keepers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Emperor angelfish</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 13 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Emperor Angelfish are found throughout the Indo-Pacific regions, including the Red Sea, Eastern Africa, Japan, the Great Barrier Reef and New Caledonia. Sightings have also been reported in Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Florida, most likely from inappropriate captive release. Remember, if you purchase one, you are responsible for the entire lifespan of this fish! The Emperor Angelfish will need more room than many other marine tropicals, so be sure to plan ahead.</p><p>In the wild, Emperor Angelfish congregate along coral reefs in shallow waters. Juveniles prefer hiding under ledges and as subadults, move to reef holes along surge channels, where meals are plentiful. Adults live in caves and ledges in calmer reef waters, often in male-female pairs or harems of one male with multiple females.</p><p>Due to their severe color differentiation, juveniles were thought to be a completely different species until the 1930s.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Emperor Angelfish juvenile has a bold contrast of royal blue, black and white stripes extending across its body in an arch pattern with spots on their dorsal, caudal and anal fins. They are very similar in appearance to juvenile Koran Angelfish , also known as the Semicircle Angelfish. You can distinguish between the two by the complete white circle at the tail base of the Emperor Angelfish whereas the Koran has a ""c""-shape.</p><p>Adults are brightly colored with yellow and dark blue stripes horizontally across the body. The mouth will be white or light grey with the forehead and operculum a dark blue to black. Although it may not look like it, this pattern is excellent for blending in with a colorful reef background. The stripe pattern helps break up a fish hiding in a reef with contrasting light and shadows.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>As a semi-aggressive fish, the Emperor Angelfish may not play well with more peaceful fish. They will naturally prey on invertebrate species, including soft corals, sea stars, clams and anemones.</p><p>It is best to keep only once adult Emperor Angelfish per tank. If you have multiple fish per tank, it is best to keep fish in bonded male-female pairs.</p><p>The best tankmates for the Emperor Angelfish are smaller, aggressive fish, such as dottybacks, wrasses and damselfish. Large semi-aggressive fish, such as tangs and other large angels should be closely monitored, but may get along okay if properly introduced all at once to limit competition for territory and in a big enough tank. Remember, the Emperor Angelfish needs a minimum of 175 gallons to .</p><h2>Emperor Angelfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>This type of fish is not for the beginner fish keeper. Advanced intermediates who have mastered saltwater tank setup and care are the only ones who should consider these lively fish.</p><p>In the wild, one Emperor Angelfish may have a very large territory, so this will translate to a large tank size. 175 gallons is bare minimum for one individual, but bigger is always better, no matter what type of fish you keep. Like many other marine tropicals, keeping their water quality pristine is key to good health and longevity.</p><p>Since they like to graze, having ready access to live rock is crucial. You should plan on having a little extra as they nibble it down. Emperor Angelfish also like to find a cave of their own, so make sure there are plenty of spots for all fish varieties in the tank who like a cozy cave.</p><p>Keep in mind that your invertebrates, including clams, corals and sea stars, might be nipped by Emperor Angelfish, so either give them places to hide or keep them out of the tank.</p><h2>Emperor Angelfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Wild Angelfish graze on a variety of foods, including algae, invertebrates and corals. Like many other tropical saltwater fish, they eat throughout the day, a trait that should be mirrored in their captive counterparts as best as possible.</p><p>In captivity, Angelfish can be fed a staple marine omnivore pelleted diet. You should supplement their diet with dried seaweed, algae-based dried food, frozen crustaceans, and a variety of other frozen diets. It is best to give them a varied diet of about 50 percent pellets (can be multiple varieties mixed together) in addition to a minimum of two other frozen or dried options. This will provide the best well-rounded diet.</p><p>Since they are grazing tropical fish, you will need to feed them 2-3 times per day. Due to their aggressive nature, spread the food out throughout the aquarium so all occupants get a fair share.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Although very subtle, adult male and female Emperor Angelfish differ in color. Males will have darker coloration just behind their eyes and female colors overall tend to be less vibrant. Without having a sexually mature male and female next to each other, it is very hard to differentiate the sexes. Males also tend to be slightly larger than adult females.</p><h2>Breeding the Emperor Angelfish </h2><p>Emperor Angelfish have not been bred successfully in captivity at this time.</p><p>In the wild, male and females will surface to spawn. External fertilization will occur and the eggs will be swept over the reef. This strategy allows a small percentage of the thousands of eggs produced to find safe places away from predators.</p>",939

The earliest written descriptions of the spotted danio are from the early 1900s. Since the 1960s, the export of this fish was affected dramatically by the political instability in what was then called Burma. Along with the stabilization of the country since the 2000s, this beautiful fish has started to make a comeback in the aquarium trade.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Dwarf danio, dwarf spotted danio, spotted brown, spotted danio</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches, usually smaller</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This species originates in the lakes, streams, rivers, rice paddies, and various still bodies of water in Myanmar. The range of this species is relatively limited, having been found only in the central regions of the country, where it is primarily a seasonal fish. During dry periods of the year, water sources dry up, and this fish diminishes in number. When the monsoons come, bringing copious amounts of water with them, fish populations rebound.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The body is silvery in color and iridescent under good lighting. The most defining feature of this species is a single bold dark stripe that runs from gill to tail, turning bluer in color as it nears the tail. This stripe narrows when it reaches the tail, but continues through the tail fin. Above this stripe is a white stripe, which in turn is bordered by a much thinner dark stripe of the same color as the primary dark stripe. The small stripe often breaks up into a series of small spots as it reaches the area of the tail.</p><p>Below the primary dark stripe is a series of small spots that cover the lower part of the body. The fins are relatively colorless for the most part, except for the strip on the tail fin, as well as spots on the anal fin. These spots on the anal fin are a means to identify this particular species. In addition to spots, the anal fin also is edged in pale brown. The brown anal fin edging is more predominant in males than females.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Spotted danios are a peaceful fish that get along with other species. However, they are rather timid. This, combined with their diminutive size, limits their suitability for community aquariums. They will do well when kept with other small species, particularly those from the same part of the world. This includes the glowlight danio and panther danio, among other species originating from Myanmar.</p><p>Small tetras and rasboras are also suitable tankmates, as well as cory catfish. Spotted danios should always be kept in schools of at least a half dozen, preferably more. The larger the school, the less timid the individuals will be.</p><h2>Dwarf Spotted Danio Habitat and Care </h2><p>Spotted danios are most comfortable in a habitat that is similar to their native conditions. They do best in a well-planted aquarium of live plants, but artificial plants will do. A dark substrate is ideal for showing off the lighter colors of this species. Overhead lighting will also bring out their delicate coloration. Provide some bogwood and rocks to complete the river habitat. The aquarium should have a well-fitted cover as this species is inclined to jump.</p><p>Water conditions are not extremely critical, but these danios are sensitive to build up of toxins, so regular water changes are recommended. Soft to moderately hard water is suitable, with an acidic to neutral pH. Like many other types of danios, this species can tolerate colder water temperatures, but when breeding, elevating the temperature is recommended.</p><h2>Dwarf Spotted Danio Diet and Feeding </h2><p>This species is omnivorous and will accept almost any food, including flakes, small pellets, freeze-dried foods, and frozen foods. They particularly relish small live foods, which should be provided as supplemental food when possible. In place of live food, use frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia or mosquito larvae.</p><p>Spotted danios will feed in the upper portion of the tank, but they are still rather timid and may not compete well for food with boisterous fish. If they are in a tank with more active species, take care to ensure the spotted danio is receiving its fair share of food. Use multiple feeding rings to help distribute food more evenly among tankmates.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Females are larger overall than males and have a rounder body. The slimmer male is more brightly colored, while females have more subdued coloration. In males, the anal fin has a golden tint with a light brown edging. When well-conditioned for spawning, the male becomes even more vibrantly colored, while the female will become rounder in the belly as she fills with eggs.</p><h2>Breeding the Dwarf Spotted Danio </h2><p>Spotted danios are relatively easy to breed. In some cases, they may spawn without any special accommodations. You may not even be aware that spawning has taken place. However, they are voracious egg and fry eaters; if the owner wishes to raise most or all of the spawn to adulthood, a separate tank is needed to ensure survival.</p><p>A separate breeding tank can also serve as a grow-out tank. This tank should be set up with a matured sponge filter and filled only half to two-thirds full with water in the range of 77 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 26 Celsius). Lighting should be dim, and the tank should be equipped with either a spawning mat or plenty of fine-leafed plants, such as Java moss. Alternatively, mesh can be used on the bottom to allow the eggs to fall out of reach of the adult fish.</p><p>Condition the breeders with live foods before spawning. When the breeders are ready, place two males and one female in the prepared tank. Males will actively court the female, eventually resulting in the female beginning to deposit eggs. A dozen or so are released at a time with a maximum of only a couple hundred, usually far less. Promptly remove the adult fish once they finish laying eggs. In approximately 24 to 48 hours, the eggs will hatch; this will happen sooner if the water temperature is higher. Lighting should be kept very dim, as the fry are sensitive to light.</p><p>After a few days, the fry will become free-swimming. Initially, they will feed on infusoria; move on to freshly hatched brine shrimp. If unable to provide infusoria, use a commercially prepared fry food, feeding them frequent small meals. As the fry grow, larger foods can be fed.</p><p>There has been reported cross-breeding between this species and pearl danios, as well as other species of danio. However, the fry produced from these crosses are usually infertile.</p>",1099

If you have a pair of them, the two fish will swim together. Dwarf gouramis are considered labyrinth fish, which means they breathe the air with a lung-like labyrinth organ and need to have access to the water's surface. If you proceed to breed this species, their complex bubble nests display impressive construction instincts.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Dwarf gourami, flame gourami, powder blue gourami, red gourami, sunset gourami</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4-6 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Peaceful and Shy Dwarf Gourami</h3><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Originating in India, West Bengal, Assam, and Bangladesh, the dwarf gourami are native to thickly vegetated waters. They are often found together with other gourami species in the genus . In the river plains of northern India, larger species of gouramis are one of the most common food fish and are sold dried or as fish-meal in many markets.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Its common name ""dwarf"" fits this fish well, as it is one of the smallest of the gouramis. Males are slightly larger than females and have a bright orange-red body with turquoise-blue, vertical stripes that extend into the fins. Females remain a duller, silvery blue-gray color and never achieve the male's brilliant colors.</p><p>There are several color variants that have been developed by selective breeding at fish farms, including solid light blue (powder blue), neon, rainbow, and red/blushing. Powder blues are predominately blue with only a little red showing on the body. Neons display a brighter blue pattern than the standard variety. Rainbows have especially brilliant orange-red bodies with blue stripes, in addition to a green-gold metallic sheen. Reds (flame gouramis) are almost solid red throughout the body with solid blue dorsal fins.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>This species is usually peaceful and can be kept with other species that are not too large or aggressive. Other brightly colored species can sometimes cause male gouramis to become aggressive as they are mistaken for rivals. Peaceful, small schooling fish are suitable tank mates as well as most bottom-dwelling fish. Some potential tankmates may include dwarf cichlids, cardinal tetras, or neon tetras.</p><h2>Dwarf Gourami Habitat and Care </h2><p>Dwarf gouramis are well suited to smaller aquariums as well as community aquariums. Gouramis can be skittish when subjected to noise and should be kept in a quiet location. Provide plenty of vegetation, including floating plants that cover only part of the surface of the water, as these labyrinth fish need access to the surface of the aquarium to breathe air.</p><h2>Dwarf Gourami Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In nature, gouramis eat small insects and larvae from the surface of the water and graze on algal growth on rocks and plants. In captivity, they will eat flake food, freeze-dried food, frozen foods, and vegetable tablets. To maintain good health, supplement their diet with periodic feedings of live foods such as worms. Live foods should also be used to condition breeder pairs.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males are generally larger than females and more vividly colored. As males reach maturity, they develop elongated dorsal and anal fin tips that come to a point. In females, these fins are shorter and rounded.</p><h2>Breeding the Dwarf Gourami </h2><p>Lowering the water level to six to eight inches and raising the water temperature to 82 degrees Fahrenheit will trigger spawning. Vegetation is essential as male gouramis construct bubble nest out of plant materials, which they then bind together with bubbles. Nests are very elaborate and sturdy, reaching several inches across and an inch deep. For aquarium plants, are good choices for the breeding tank. You can also offer peat fiber as a building material.</p><p>Once the nest had been built, the male will begin courting the female, usually in the afternoon or evening. He signals his intentions by swimming around the female with flared fins, attempting to draw her to the nest where he will continue his courting display. If the female accepts the male, she will begin swimming in circles with the male beneath the bubble nest. When she is ready to spawn, she touches the male on either the back or the tail with her mouth.</p><p>Upon this signal the male will embrace the female, turning her first on her side and finally on her back. At this point, the female will release approximately five dozen clear eggs which are immediately fertilized by the male. Most of the eggs will float up into the bubble nest. Eggs that stray are collected by the male and placed in the nest. Once all the eggs are secured in the nest, the pair will spawn again.</p><p>If more than one female is present in the breeding tank, the male may spawn with all of them. The spawning sessions will continue for two to four hours and produce between 300 and 800 eggs. Upon completion, the male will place a fine layer of bubbles beneath the eggs, assuring that they remain in the bubble nest. At this point, the female(s) should be removed from the tank to reduce stress to the male.</p><p>The male will then take sole responsibility for the eggs, aggressively defending the nest and surrounding territory. In 12 to 24 hours the fry will hatch and continue developing within the protection of the bubble nest. After three days they are sufficiently developed to be free-swimming.</p><p>Remove the male from the tank once the fry have left the bubble nest or he may consume the young. Feed the fry on micro-foods such as infusoria, rotifers, or commercial fry food for the first week. After a week, they can be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp and finely ground flake foods.</p>",938

It is easy to keep and breed, and the mating practices of this fish make for an interesting story for those studying unique animal rituals.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Dwarf Victoria mouthbrooder</p><p>Adult Size: 3.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Egyptian mouthbrooder is native to north and east Africa and is widespread in that area. The vast majority of the species originate from the great lakes of the African Rift Valley, namely Lake Tanganyika, Lake Malawi, and Lake Victoria. It was first imported to Europe in 1902. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>These fish have an elongated oval body with scales that have a metallic blue-green sheen. Fins have a pattern of orange, although the tank-bred fish you find online often lack the beautiful colors of the wild species. Though they are rather plain in appearance, males have red on the end of the anal fin and females are noticeably smaller and paler.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Dwarf Egyptian mouthbrooders can be aggressive toward other species inhabiting the lower level of the habitat. If you wish to keep this fish with other dwarf cichlids, catfish, or loaches, you will need a large aquarium. In a smaller tank, good tankmates include the African tetras and small surface-dwelling species such as hatchet fish.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Male Dwarf Egyptian mouthbrooders are very aggressive toward one another and only one should be kept in a harem situation with several females. Do not keep Egyptian mouthbrooders with timid fish.</p><h2>Dwarf Egyptian Mouthbrooder Habitat and Care </h2><p>Dwarf Egyptian mouthbrooders can be kept in a relatively small aquarium like a 20-gallon tank. The aquarium should be decorated with densely planted areas as well as open areas, and the fish should be provided with plenty of suitably sized caves. At least one cave per fish is required.</p><p>It is a good idea to create natural territorial borders since some fish can be quite aggressive and these natural barriers can help defuse this aggressiveness. Egyptian mouthbrooders are suitable for community tanks with similarly sized fish that are tough enough to tolerate the temperament of the Egyptian mouthbrooder.</p><p>These fish are quite adaptable to many water chemistries, as they are found in a variety of environments. Change the water regularly to keep ambient levels of nitrate as low as possible. Nitrate levels are more important than pH and hardness, though the ideal is perhaps neutral to slightly alkaline water with a moderate level of hardness. Regarding temperature and filtration, these fish are not fussy.</p><h2>Dwarf Egyptian Mouthbrooder Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The Egyptian mouthbrooder will accept almost all food, like cichlid pellets, and can be fed flake food. Strive to give them a varied diet; they do well on a base diet of flake food but complement their diet with frozen food and live food every now and then.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>It is very easy to tell the difference between the sexes in this species. Males are larger and more colorful; they have red spots on the caudal fin which are not present in females. Females are smaller, gray, and dull-looking.</p><h2>Breeding the Dwarf Egyptian Mouthbrooder </h2><p>With good feeding, it is not difficult to get these fish to spawn in the aquarium. At spawning time, the male Egyptian mouthbrooder digs a depression in the sand by fanning his tail. The male coaxes the female into his ""nest."" The male can be quite forceful in his seduction attempts and this is why it is preferable to spawn this species in a harem situation as the male's attention will be divided. When a female is willing, she will follow the male to his pit, where spawning occurs.</p><p>The act itself is preceded by a display of circling by both fish. The male will nuzzle the vent of the female, and it may be this ""dance"" that triggers her to release the eggs. As the eggs are laid the female immediately picks them up with her mouth and then mouths the vent of the male, who then fertilizes the eggs in her mouth. Sometimes fertilization occurs before the female picks up the eggs as the fish circle quite quickly. This courtship sequence is repeated until the female is holding 5 to 100 eggs in her mouth.</p><p>For two weeks, there is no sign of the eggs or young. Throughout the incubation period, the mother can be seen pumping water over the fry, through her mouth and gill covers, and she occasionally rearranges them within her mouth. Then one day the whole brood is released from the mother's mouth to try out their fins. At first, they venture forth for only short periods.</p><p>For three weeks or more, the young hover around the mother's mouth. At the first sign of danger, they dart back into her mouth for protection. At last, the young brood becomes so large that the mother's mouth no longer can hold them. From then on they must manage on their own. The mother becomes a danger to them, for once the young are too large for her mouth, she may decide to eat them.</p><p>During this parenting time (for about five weeks) the mother refrains from eating anything. Her body shrivels, and in some cases, the female even starves to death in the process of protecting her young. Usually, a week or two of good feeding restores her to normal proportions.</p>",874

It can ""swim"" through sand, move rocks and substrate, and reorganize a fishtank. On the other hand, it's aggressive and almost impossible to keep in a community tank. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Dragon Wrasse, Rockmover Wrasse, Striped Wrasse, Clown Wrasse, Reindeer Wrasse, Red Belly Wrasse</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Care</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Dragon Wrasse is native to the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Red Sea, Panama, as far north as the Hawaiian islands and Micronesia. It can also be found in the Eastern Pacific from the Gulf of California to Panama, across to Japan. They usually inhabit depths of .5 to 14 meters, on or near sand channels which it cruises looking for food.</p><p>The sand is also a source of refuge for this and most other wrasses. When it feels threatened, both the adult and juvenile Dragon Wrasse will dive into the sand and wiggle their way to safety. It is amazing how far this wrasse can travel under the sand in a short amount of time.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Dragon Wrasse fish are unusual in that juveniles look completely different from adults. Young Dragon Wrasse is sometimes nicknamed Reindeer Wrasse because of their unique appendages that look something like horns. Juveniles' bodies are flat and burgundy-colored with long pelvic fins and dorsal fin filaments. The fins have variegated coloring in reds, blacks, and browns, with membranes which can look translucent in the right light. As the juveniles glide and dip near the sea floor they look very much like seaweed, providing them with useful camouflage. If they are spotted by a predator, Reindeer Wrasse will actually dive head first into the sand and hide until the danger passes. It can even ""swim"" under the sand, reappearing in a new location.</p><p>As they grow up, Reindeer Wrasse lose their unique appendages and filaments as well as their special name. The coloring on their bodies changes to a gray honeycomb pattern, while their heads become gray. Their tails become white with black edging. As adults, these fish are no longer Reindeer Wrasse but are now official adult Dragon Wrasse.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>It's not easy to find ideal tankmates for a Dragon Wrasse. While juveniles can live peacefully in a community tank, adult Dragon Wrasse will eat almost any moving creature, which means that anything other than sponges and corals is fair game. Snails, crabs, and most other aquarium fish are also prey. Even those fish that are usually able to hide from predators will find it hard to escape from a fish that can (and does) turn over rocks and search inside caves to find a meal.</p><p>In addition to these considerations, it's also important to know that Dragon Wrasse will, as they grow up, become ""king"" of its territory. If you plan to add these fish to a tank with any other fish, it must be the last fish in the tank; otherwise, it will simply eat newcomers. Possible tankmates (to be added to the tank before introducing the Dragon Wrasse) include groupers, hawkfishes, snappers, grunts, and triggerfish.</p><p>If you're not eager to play host to a tankful of aggressive fish, but think you'd enjoy watching a Dragon Wrasse as it metamorphoses and then learns to rearrange all the rocks and substrate in your tank, the easiest solution is to raise a single Dragon Wrasse from juvenile to adult in a live-rock tank that includes no other mobile animals.</p><h2>Dragon Wrasse Habitat and Care </h2><p>A fish that is constantly on the move, the Dragon Wrasse needs to be provided with plenty of room to move around, and a two-to-four-inch bed of soft sand where it can bury itself. The tank should have a tight fitting lid as the Dragon Wrasse has a tendency to jump out of tanks, especially when it is startled.</p><p>The substrate should be of small grain sand. Since the Dragon Wrasse has a tendency to bury itself in the sand, larger grain sand or crushed coral can cause cuts or abrasions on the fish's skin which leaves an opening for bacteria to enter the fish and cause a bacterial infection which can be difficult to treat and cure. This species is also prone to developing internal bacterial infection associated with the bladder due to poor substrate environment.</p><p>Tiny juveniles typically do not fare well in captivity. It is not unusual for them to waste away and starve to death due to the lack of accepting food, and thus not taking in the high caloric diet they require to survive. It is best to obtain a sub-adult specimen of more than two inches in size, and one that is already eating well to help avoid problems with starvation.</p><h2>Dragon Wrasse Diet </h2><p>The Dragon Wrasse is a carnivore that possesses two prominent canine teeth in the front of each jaw that is used for feeding on its favorite prey. Prey, for the Dragon Wrasse, is a very general term: it will eat small fishes, all types of desirable crustaceans and motile invertebrates, which includes serpent and brittle starfishes, bad bristle as well as beneficial worms, shrimps, hermit crabs, crabs, and snails.</p><p>These fish should be fed a hearty diet of suitably bite-sized pieces of meaty foods that include fresh or frozen seafood, silversides, live or frozen brine, and mysid shrimp, live grass or ghost shrimp, live black worms, and flake food. Smaller Dragon Wrasses can be fed chopped up pieces of meaty fares as well as Mysis Shrimp. It's best to feed these fish three times a day.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Males and females look very similar and are about the same size.</p><h2>Breeding of the Dragon Wrasse </h2><p>It's very unlikely that your Dragon Wrasse will breed in captivity. In the wild, the male circles the female and then rises through the water followed by the female. Side by side, they rise slowly while the female releases her eggs and the male fertilizes them. The eggs are about .59 millimeters wide, and they are buoyant so they can ride the ocean currents. The eggs float for as long as 75 days before they hatch. </p>",1005

These fish may be small, but they can be aggressive and will fiercely defend their cave or crevice home. Dottybacks are hermaphrodite fish and employ various reproductive strategies.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Dottyback</p><p>Adult Size: 3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 7 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>There are many species of Dottyback fishes native to Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Known for their vibrant coloration, dottyback fish are vivid additions to any reef or coral aquarium.</p><p>Many varieties of dottyback have been successfully captive-bred. Even hybrids are being seen that do very well in captivity. Always try to purchase captive-bred fish to limit those taken from wild populations.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>All dottybacks have elongated bodies with various colorations. The Purple or Orchid Dottyback are known for their bright, vibrant purple color. The Indigo or Electric Indigo are captive hybrids with a bight blue stripe along their lateral midline mixed with white and black stripes. The Neon Dottyback and Purple Stripe Dottyback are a mix of bright colors, broken up both vertically and horizontally along the sides of the fish. No matter which species you choose, it will be a bright addition to your saltwater aquarium.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Dottybacks may be small, but they can be aggressive. They do well in many saltwater and reef community tanks, provided they have a hiding place to call their own. It is critical to provide your dottyback with a cave or crevice among the décor that they can live in and defend.</p><p>You can add more than one dottyback to an aquarium, but to be sure that they do not overlap in territory, add them at the same time so one is not more dominant than the other. Some good tankmates for dottybacks include semi-aggressive fish that are too big for small caves, such as the Flame Angelfish, and some species of Tang and Surgeonfish.</p><h2>Dottyback Habitat and Care </h2><p>Hiding places are key when adding dottybacks to your aquarium. If they have nowhere to hide, your fish will become stressed and more aggressive towards the other fish in your tank. Since they are not very big, small crevices and caves will suffice, provided there are no other small fish, such as damsel fish, competing for the same spot.</p><p>As with all saltwater aquariums, it is vital to provide good water quality. Choose a salt mixture that fits your fish's needs. If your aquarium does not have corals, you should be using a marine mix, not a coral or reef mix.</p><h2>Dottyback Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Since they are carnivores, dottybacks will require a diet rich in meaty products such as dried or frozen shrimp. Frozen diets may lose some of their vitamin content, especially water-soluble vitamins like Vitamin C. Complete pelleted diets are available to help supplement frozen carnivore diets.</p><p>For most marine fish species, a variety in the diet is key. Depending on the mix of species in your aquarium, you should select their diet from the herbivore, omnivore or carnivore spectrum of available fish foods.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Most dottybacks are hermaphrodites. Depending on the species, your fish may be simultaneously hermaphroditic, with both functioning male and female reproductive organs; protogynous hermaphrodites, born a female and convert to a male; or protandrous hermaphrodites, born a male and convert to a female.</p><p>The common Orchid Dottyback is an example of a protogynous species that starts as all females with the largest fish converting to male. This means that the largest fish in a group or pair will likely be a male.</p><h2>Breeding the Dottyback </h2><p>In order to successfully breed your dottyback, you should know which reproductive model your species follows. Be sure to provide them with an appropriate home and feed an appropriate diet. You will need at least two fish of the same species or you may want to breed in a group, known as a harem, with one dominant male and the rest females. Fish will lay eggs in their cave or crevice, with eggs hatching in approximately 4 days.</p><p>Larval fish will be easy prey for other fish in the tank, so be sure to breed your dottybacks in a separate breeding tank. It is critical to feed your dottyback fry an appropriate diet in order for them to properly development.</p>",703

Its sudden popularity, however, led to over-harvesting; as a result, it is now on the endangered list. Another variant of this fish called grey and gold denison barb is critically endangered. This species does well in captivity, however, it requires a very large aquarium with room for fast swimming over distances, and fast-moving, pristine water.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Bleeding eye barb, denison barb, denison's flying fox, red comet barb, red line barb, red lined torpedo fish, roseline shark, torpedo barb, Miss Kerala</p><p>Adult Size: 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This species was first described in 1865 and is endemic to Kerala and south Karnataka in the southern area of India often referred to as the Malabar Coast. They are found in large schools in pools, streams, and rivers that are generally heavily vegetated and rocky, with water that is highly oxygenated.</p><p>Like many species, the denison barb has been referred to by several scientific names as well as a host of common names. Currently, the accepted scientific name for this species is . Prior scientific names include and .</p><p>This barb is an example of what can happen to a species that is wild-caught and suddenly becomes in high demand. After being named as one of the top new fish species by Aquarama, the international ornamental fish exhibition, this fish quickly became quite popular. Within a decade, well over half of all ornamental fish exports from India were denison barbs. Unfortunately, the result was a significant drop in wild populations due largely to overfishing.</p><p>Loss of natural habitat as the result of human pollution and deforestation has also contributed to the reduction of this species in the wild. Efforts have been made to counter this by instituting periods when collection is not allowed, as well as commercial breeding programs in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe. However, this fish still remains endangered and is on the IUCN red list.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Long and torpedo-shaped, it is easy to see why many call this the red lined torpedo barb. The silvery body of this fish is set off by a black line that runs the entire length of the body from snout to tail. This is contrasted by a brilliant red line that runs just above the black line, running from the nose through the eye and continuing to the midpoint of the body. The dorsal fin is also edged in bright red, while the caudal fin is striped with black and bright yellow stripes. Mature specimens are known to develop a greenish hue on the head.</p><p>Reaching an adult size of six inches, this species has a pair of barbels that help them locate prey. In recent years, a gold variant has been bred that has the red stripe but lacks the black stripe of the wild variety. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Denison barbs are generally peaceful, but when they are kept in less space than they require, they will aggressively compete with other species at feeding time. They are not fin-nippers, but care should be taken to keep them with species that are similar or larger in size.</p><p>They should be kept in schools, of a half dozen or more. As a result, they are best kept only in large tanks of 55 gallons at a minimum. Other barbs, danios, larger members of the tetra family, rainbow fish, and most cichlids are suitable tank mates. The key is to keep them in a school and provide them with plenty of space.</p><h2>Denison Barb Habitat and Care </h2><p>Because this species quickly grows to be quite large, they quickly outgrow even 55-gallon tanks. A sufficiently sized tank should have plenty of room for free swimming of some distance, as these are an active fish that needs to be on the move.</p><p>Some hiding places are also recommended; rock caves or driftwood can be used. Live plants can be problematic, as they may be uprooted by darting denison barbs. However, hardy species such as anubias can be used, if well anchored.</p><p>This species is accustomed to high oxygen levels and pristine water. High levels of organic matter are not tolerated well, which means regular water changes and tank cleaning are key to keeping this species healthy. Some water movement is necessary, which can be provided with a spray bar or powerhead. Water temperatures can be lower than for other tropical freshwater fish; however sudden drops in temperature must be avoided.</p><h2>Denison Barb Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Denison barbs are omnivorous and will accept many foods. For optimal health, they should be fed a wide variety including meaty foods as well as vegetable matter. Live foods will be readily accepted, including bloodworms, daphnia, cyclops, and shrimp. Algae, spirulina, and even fresh vegetables will also be readily accepted.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are few clear differences between the sexes. However, adult females grow a bit larger, are heavier-bodied, and are sometimes less brightly colored than males.</p><h2>Breeding the Denison Barb </h2><p>There have been limited spawnings reported in home aquaria. All cases have been accidental, and little is known about the conditions under which spawning occurred. However, there have been successful commercial spawning operations in which hormones were used to stimulate spawning in this species. These spawnings have taken place in soft, acidic water, with the eggs being scattered on plants.</p>",891

Even with its eel-like shape and fascinating burrowing habits, these fish are still surprisingly social and prefer the company of others of their own kind. The coolie loach is most active at twilight and at nighttime, both in nature and in the home aquarium, while remaining hidden during the day. There are many subspecies of this fish, however, all coolies have the same dietary and habitat needs, so knowing the specific subspecies is not critical.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Kuhli loach, coolie loach, khuli loach, prickly eye</p><p>Adult Size: 4 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Originating from Southeast Asia, the coolie loach is indigenous to the streams of Borneo, Java, western Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, and Thailand. Originally named , and later changed to , the current scientific name of this fish is Many references still utilize former scientific names.</p><p>is one of two dozen species of kuhlis, a number of which closely resemble each other. The subspecies and have been described based on differences in coloration and markings. (also known as the Sumatra Kuhli) has fewer and darker bands than . Sporting even wider bands is the . Although remains the most popular and readily available of the coolie loaches, it is not unusual to purchase an incorrectly named loach.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Coolie loaches have an eel-like body that is yellow to pink in color, with multiple dark brown bands or stripes that partially or fully encircle the body. The body and stripe color patterns vary based on subspecies. The coolie loach possesses no lateral line, the fins are small, and the dorsal fin is located on the lower third of the body, much closer to the tail than the head.</p><p>The eye of the coolie is covered by a thin layer of transparent skin and is hidden under one of the dark bands. Below the eyes are a pair of sharp spines that rise if the fish is threatened, making it difficult for a predator to swallow them or for an owner to net them; take special care when doing so. The mouth of the coolie loach points downward and is surrounded by four pairs of barbels.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Coolie loaches are happiest when kept in groups of a half-dozen or more other coolies, and they are easily kept with non-aggressive fish. When kept singly they are quite shy and will remain hidden most of the time. Avoid keeping coolies with large or territorial fish, such as cichlids; instead choose small fish such as danios, rasboras, and tetras.</p><h2>Coolie Loach Habitat and Care </h2><p>In nature, the coolie loach lives in locations where there is clear, slow-moving water running over sand. They will tolerate a range of water parameters but prefer water on the acidic side with slightly colder temperatures in the mid-70s Fahrenheit. The smooth substrate is a must as these obligate burrowers will be injured by substrates having rough edges. Sand is the preferred substrate for these fish.</p><p>Make sure the tank is tightly covered as coolie loaches will jump out of the tank, particularly when startled. The inlet tube on the filter needs to also be covered with mesh or a sponge, as there are many documented cases of loaches swimming up the inlet tube and getting trapped in the filter. Owners have reported cases in which coolie loaches have disappeared for months, only to be found under the UGF or inside a canister filter, still very much alive. Take a headcount on your coolies to ensure you haven't lost one or the lost fish may suffer and starve.</p><p>Coolie tanks should have plenty of safe hiding places, preferably in low, live plants when possible. Rocks, driftwood, and caves are all the best decor for coolie loaches. Keep lighting subdued, however, a well-lit tank is suitable as long as it is heavily planted, thus offering shady places for the loaches to hide. Place a moonlight in the tank so you can observe their nocturnal activities.</p><h2>Coolie Loach Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Live foods are the preferred diet for coolie loaches. However, they will accept a variety of foods, including frozen, freeze-dried, tablets, wafers and flake foods. The key is to remember that they need smaller foods that will sink. Always feed coolies at night.</p><p>When it comes to live foods, bloodworms are readily accepted as well as glass worms, tubifex, and daphnia. Frozen versions of these foods are the next best option. Feed live or frozen foods a couple of times per week to augment dry foods.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are no readily discernible differences between coolie loaches when they are not breeding. Some hobbyists have observed that males have larger pectoral fins, with thickening of the second ray. Once females are carrying eggs they become noticeably larger, sometimes in the extreme. In some cases, it's even possible to see the green-colored eggs through the skin of the female's abdomen.</p><h2>Breeding the Coolie Loach </h2><p>Breeding of coolie loaches is challenging, but it has happened in captivity. The breeding tank should have low water levels, very dim lighting, and floating plants, which will be used by the female when laying her eggs. Water pH should be about 6.5, and the water hardness should be lowered. Dense vegetation will help promote spawning. The more comfortable the coolies become with their environment, the greater the chance of spawning.</p><p>Because coolies are communal spawners, keeping a larger group will increase the likelihood of spawning. Fish do not reach sexual maturity for two years, which means you may have to be patient if your fish are young when you purchase them. Condition the fish with plenty of live food to encourage spawning.</p><p>As females near the time to lay their eggs, they will grow very large. When ready to spawn, the female will release bright green adhesive eggs, usually on the underside of the floating plants. To ensure the greatest number of fry survive, remove the adult fish to their original tank once the eggs have been laid.</p><p>Eggs will hatch in approximately 24 hours, and they can number up to several hundred. Infusoria, generally present in mature live plants, is an ideal first food. Freshly hatched brine shrimp are also a good first food. Commercially prepared fry food or finely crushed flakes are suitable as food for coolie loach fry.</p>",1070

Convict Tangs can grow up to about 8 inches long, but many juvenile Convict Tangs available for purchase are smaller, ranging from less than an inch to about 6 inches long. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Considered reef safe, Convict Tangs can be a good choice for a large saltwater aquarium, whether a community reef aquarium or a fish only tank. Convict Tangs can cohabitate peacefully with most other peaceful fish, but these fish may have issues with other surgeonfish, as well as with fish that have a similar body type like angelfish or butterflyfish. Some aquarists find that it is possible to house more than one tang together provided that the tank is large enough (at least 100 gallons), the tank is not overcrowded with too many fish and the fish are introduced to the thank in the correct order (when adding fish, always introduce the most aggressive species last). At the end of the day, though, the success of keeping more than one tang together in a saltwater aquarium depends on the individual fish involved. </p><p>In the wild, Convict Tangs are schooling fish. It's possible to keep several Convict Tangs together in a large and long tank, preferably a reef tank with lots of live rock and hiding places. If you want to try this, introduce all of the Convict Tangs at the same time for the best results. Note that success in keeping a group of Convict Tangs like this varies; some Convict Tangs will fight even in very large tanks. </p><p>Convict Tangs do not tend to bother invertebrates like crabs and shrimp, and generally leave corals alone as long as they are getting enough to eat. They will graze on unsightly algae growing in the tank, making them excellent housekeepers.</p><h2>Convict Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>Convict Tangs are swimmers. In their natural habit, Convict Tangs swim in schools, traversing the reefs all day as they graze on algae. In captivity, Convict Tangs need plenty of space for swimming. Although the number of gallons of the tank is important, equally important is the length of the tank. To allow enough space for swimming, Convict Tangs should be housed in tanks that are a minimum of 100 gallons (the bigger the better) and a minimum of 6 feet in length. Tanks this size and larger are ideal for all fish, but especially tangs because it avoids crowding and territorial spats with other fish, particularly other tangs. </p><h2>Convict Tang Diet and Feeding  </h2><p>Tangs are somewhat delicate and prone to developing disease keeping them well-nourished can help them fight off potential infections. Tangs are primarily herbivores, although many Convict Tangs also enjoy eating meaty foods like mysis shrimp and brine shrimp. In addition to meaty foods, feed lots of marine algae and seaweed based foods (frozen, flakes or pellets) to keep your Convict Tang plump and healthy. Many tangs love spirulina flakes and dried nori on a hanging veggie clip. Some aquarists like to soak nori and other marine-based foods in a vitamin supplement made specifically for marine fish to bolster health. If your tank contains live rock, the Convict Tang will graze on algae growing on the rocks. When well fed, Convict Tangs will generally leave coral alone, but hungry Convict Tangs have been known to pick at large polyp stony (LPS) corals. </p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male and female Convict Tangs do not have discernable physical differences.</p><h2>Breeding of the Convict Tang </h2><p>Convict Tangs do not breed readily in captivity as their fry are free floating in the planktonic stage for several months and tend to be sucked up into aquarium filters. In their nature habitat, Convict Tangs are group spawners. At dusk, small groups of Convict Tangs will separate from the larger groups. The females will release eggs into the open water and the males will fertilize them. The Convict Tang larvae float along with plankton for approximately two months, after which time they make their way to sheltered places like tide pools where they are semi-protected as they continue to develop. Once large enough, juvenile Convict Tangs will venture out and join a school of other Convict Tangs.</p>",899

These African counterparts are equally colorful. One of these species is the Congo tetra, which shimmers in all the colors of the rainbow. This loud coloring is used for extravagant courtship displays toward both the male and female.</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>These African characin fish are found in the Congo River Basin. They populate streams, tributaries, pools, and marshes, preferring murky, slightly acidic water. The Congo tetra generally congregates in areas with tall vegetation, few trees, and substrates made up of sand, silt, and mud. Swimming in large schools, the Tetra feed on worms, crustaceans, insects, plant matter, and algae.</p><p>This species was not discovered until 1949 and was not imported as a common aquarium fish until the 1960s. During the 1970s, Florida fish farms perfected a breeding line, and most specimens found in pet stores descend from this line. They will breed true, having all of the color and beautifully trailing tails of the native African fish.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The fish in nature approaches 4 1/2 inches. However farm-raised varieties, though full finned and rich with color, will generally not grow beyond 3 or 3 1/2 inches. They have long, flat bodies with large scales. This fish shows amazing rainbow luminescence along the whole body from back to front. They are generally blue on top, red and gold in the middle, and blue on the belly. Males also have long, flowing fins that are violet with white edging; the mail's tail fin is long and flowing along the vertical medial line.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Congo tetras are schooling fish that can get anxious if they are not part of a group of at least six of the same species. If kept with other fish of the same size or smaller, Congo tetras are generally peaceful. Ideal tankmates include other tetras, rainbowfish, and catfish.</p><p>Avoid aggressive species, as they will bully your Congo tetras. Do not keep Congo tetras with any fin-nipping fish as the spectacular fins of the males will be destroyed.</p><h2>Congo Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Congo tetras are fairly hardy, but only if kept in habitats that are maintained correctly. They prefer still, dark, soft, peat-filtered water with low light levels. This can be achieved with dim aquarium lights and floating plants. They like darker substrates and enjoy nibbling on bottom-growing plants.</p><p>To help your fish maintain good health, you'll need to provide them with plenty of space and carefully filtered water. If the quality of the water drops, Congo tetras may lose some of their colorations or wind up with damaged fins.</p><h2>Congo Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Congo tetras are omnivores; in the wild, they eat insects, worms, plant matter, and algae. As pets, they are easy to feed. They enjoy live, fresh, and flake foods, as well as brine shrimp and blood worms. They should be fed small amounts several times a day. Don't worry if you don't observe your Congo tetras coming to the food, as they can be shy about partaking while being watched. If fish are not getting enough food, try a behavioral feeding ring.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males are much more colorful than females; they are considerably larger and have more elaborate fin structure with a centrally extended caudal fin and a large and pronounced dorsal fin. The females are mostly golden with shades of silver and greenish. Females have no such fanciful fins.</p><h2>Breeding the Congo Tetra </h2><p>You will need a larger breeding tank than for most tetras, because of the size of the breeders themselves, and because they will produce 300 or more eggs; all are most likely to hatch. The school of fry will grow rapidly to a size larger than full-grown neon tetras in four or five weeks.</p><p>Use a 15- or 20-gallon long tank for your breeding project; 10 gallons are not recommended. Boil enough peat moss to cover the bottom of the tank with one inch of loosely packed moss substrate (about 1/2 cubic foot for a 20-gallon long tank). Add it to a tank already filled with reverse osmosis, distilled, or rainwater if in a rural area, and let it sit for a few days until the peat moss has completely settled.</p><p>Place several thickets of Java moss on top of the peat moss substrate in several locations. Provide additional nylon breeding mops or several clumps of fine-leaved plants. The water temperature should be a steady 77 degrees Fahrenheit. There should be no aeration or filtration since this would disturb the peat moss and cloud the water.</p><p>Place a well-conditioned pair of Congo tetra, which has been kept in separate quarters, into the breeding tank shortly before lights out or shortly before sunset. Most pairs will spawn the following morning, or when the lights are turned back on; dark should be maintained for at least eight hours.</p><p>Spawning fish proceed to dive into the Java moss or spawning mops. During these dives, they release eggs and milt side by side. Some of the eggs remain in the plant or mop, but most fall into the peat moss substrate. Remove the breeders although most eggs will not be eaten since they are well hidden under the peat moss substrate.</p><p>Usually, 300 to 500 or more eggs are laid and hatching occurs from five to eight days after spawning. This differs sharply from their South American relatives, whose eggs hatch much quicker, but whose fry hang on plants for several days, being smaller and more helpless at first. When Congo tetra fry appear from the peat substrate, they are fully free-swimming and hungry.</p><p>Congo tetra fry can be fed infusoria for a day or two before they will take baby brine shrimp. They will grow quickly and take powdered dry food within two weeks, soon reaching almost an inch in length. Within three months of frequent feedings of live and commercial growth foods, they will reach two inches and show signs of color. At this point, it is possible to determine sex, but they will be six months old and three inches long before they are able to breed. With this quick growth, the need for a larger tank is obvious.</p><p>It is very important not to remove the peat from the fry rearing tank. The fish need it for water quality, and if you put them straight into freshwater, they are liable to succumb to fungus. The adult fish also prefer peat moss in the filter or substrate.</p>",1082
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/comet-goldfish-species-profile-5088723,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Comet Goldfish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Comet Goldfish Species Profile</h1><p>Jessie Sanders</p><p>The most popular aquarium fish worldwide is the Comet goldfish. These fish are best for beginners since they are hardy enough to tolerate many newbie mistakes. These long-body fish can vary in color from white to bright orange to dark brown. Properly kept, they can grow up to 12 inches or longer, so a large tank is required.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Comet goldfish, Common goldfish, Sarasa comet</p><p>Adult Size: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Origins and Distribution </h2><p>Comet goldfish originated from the Crucian carp many centuries ago. Similar to the history of the koi fish , comet goldfish were originally kept as a food source. Over many generations, people started to notice different mutations in color and would keep those fish separate. Countless generations later, we have the comet goldfish we know today. Further cross-breeding has resulted in many varieties of fancy goldfish, such as the oranda and ranchu, with distinctive structural features.</p><p>Goldfish have become an invasive species in areas where unwanted pets are ""set free."" Never release your pet fish into the wild. They may suffer a horrible fate or overwhelm the native populations. The goldfish ancestor, the Crucian carp, is native throughout Europe and Asia.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The ""traditional"" comet goldfish color is bright orange, where its ancestor is mainly brown with a lighter tan or gold belly. With mass spawning of any color goldfish, you are likely to see a wide variety of color variations passed onto the offspring.</p><p>Typical colors of goldfish vary from white, tan, gold, orange, and brown. The body may be one solid color, or your fish may have patches of various colors. Comet goldfish colors can vary widely and may change as the fish ages, and with varying water quality or diet.</p><p>Sarasa comets tend to have slightly elongated fins and more saturated colors. They look very similar to koi, often with deep red colors on a white body.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Since goldfish are peaceful community fish, the biggest differential for potential tankmates is fish size and temperature tolerances. Goldfish are freshwater fish, and can tolerate tropical temperatures, but it makes them very hungry and they will make a mess of your tank.</p><p>It is best to choose tankmates that can tolerate slightly less than tropical temperatures, around ambient room temperature, and are large enough to not be accidentally eaten during feeding time.</p><p>Good tankmates for goldfish include other goldfish, a school of zebrafish, ornamental minnows or snails.</p><p>Due to their wide temperature tolerances, goldfish are also suited to outdoor pond living. Since they do not grow as large as koi, they make a sensible addition to smaller ponds. They can be kept with koi in larger ponds if you choose.</p><h2>Comet Goldfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Comet goldfish make excellent beginner pets because they can tolerate less than ideal water quality. However, this isn't an excuse to skip your usual maintenance!</p><p>The biggest consideration with keeping comet goldfish is to provide them with enough room to grow and thrive. A small 10 or 20-gallon tank may be okay for the first few months, but starting with a 50-gallon tank or larger will ensure a successful future. A fishbowl is not an appropriate home for any fish.</p><p>Comet goldfish like to forage around in the substrate, so gravel or sand is a good substrate to use. You may see them pick up a pebble and carry it around for a bit, but it shouldn't get stuck. In the very unlikely event that something does get stuck, do not panic. Your fish can still breathe around the obstruction while you call for assistance.</p><p>This foraging behavior also means that comet goldfish are frequent tank redecorators and will often uproot plants and decorative items. They are also known for eating live plants, and not because they are hungry.</p><h2>Comet Goldfish Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Comet goldfish do best when fed a goldfish-appropriate pelleted diet. You should look for a protein around 30 to 32% and pellets will retain their nutrition better than flakes and not make a mess of your tank. There are many goldfish pellets available in pet stores.</p><p>Depending on their tank temperature, you may feed your comet goldfish once or twice a day. If your tank is less than 70F (21C), you may feed once a day, but 70F or above, feed twice a day. Your goldfish will always act hungry, so you can supplement their diet with low calorie, low protein treats such as shelled green peas.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Comet goldfish being kept in a suitable, roomy environment with good water quality and good nutrition can develop external sex characteristics.</p><p>Sex differentiation is more common in comet goldfish kept outside and exposed to normal seasonal changes.</p><p>Male comet goldfish will develop small papules on their operculum and the leading edge of their pectoral fins. Owners often mistake these for tumors, which is not the case. They may be more or less pronounced depending on the season.</p><p>Like many other fish species, females tend to be rounded and larger than the males, regardless of any other external differences.</p><h2>Breeding the Comet Goldfish </h2><p>Comet goldfish are very messy spawners, broadcasting eggs and sperm throughout their tank or pond. Breeding usually occurs in the spring for outdoor systems. If your fish are kept inside, you will need to match the changes in day and night light cycles and slowly increase the water temperature.</p><p>It is very common for comet goldfish to eat the spawned eggs, so if you want to keep their progeny, move the fertilized eggs to a separate system as soon as possible.</p>",916
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/clown-loach-1378616,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Clown Loach Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Clown Loach Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>If you've ever seen a school of clown loaches, it's hard to resist bringing a few of them home. It's even harder to imagine that this beautiful fish is eaten as food fish in Indonesia and Borneo, where it grows to over a foot in length. Fortunately for the clown loach, among aquarium enthusiasts, it's a staple in the community tank rather than on the dining table. Its orange and black striped body, red fins, and active behavior have made it one of the most popular loach species for fishkeepers.</p><h3>What is a clown loach?</h3><p>Native to the waters of Indonesia, a clown loach is a tropical freshwater fish that is part of the cobitidae family. Named for their vibrant colors, they feature an orange and black striped body and red fins.</p><p>The clown loach is a peaceful fish and coexists well with nearly any tankmate. It is also an amusing species to watch and feed as it is very active during the day. Clown loaches will even eat any annoying snails that wind up in your aquarium. The clown loach is sometimes called a scaleless fish, but it actually does have small scales embedded in its skin.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Clown loach</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 25 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The clown loach hails from the rivers and tributaries of Malaysia, Borneo, Sumatra, and Kalimantan. During spawning periods, they migrate to flooded areas of the rainforest where soft, tea-colored water flows through boggy, slow-moving streams. This loach prefers waterways that are shaded by leafy plants and lined with plant detritus such as fallen leaves, twigs, and branches.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Like all loaches, the clown loach has a long, pointed nose surrounded by sensitive whisker-like barbels and a sharp spine beneath each eye. These spines are used for defense; in captivity, these may prick fingers or snag on nets, so it's important to be careful when handling your loach.</p><p>The clown loach's arched body is long and lean, ideal for cutting through the water. True to its name, its body is bright orange to yellow, and its fins and tail are bright red. It has two wide black V-shaped stripes along the sides of its body and a third black stripe running vertically through its eye. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Peaceful with its own and other species, the clown loach prefers to have companions with which it will form a school. Virtually all non-aggressive fish are suitable as tankmates. Because they prefer to live in groups, it's wise to keep four or more in a tank. They don't like bright light, will hide among plants or rocks as well, and sleep in holes, caves, and other hiding places.</p><h2>Clown Loach Habitat and Care </h2><p>Clown loaches are large schooling fish, and they are quite active. You will need a large tank with plenty of space for your loaches to move around. At the same time, however, each and every loach should have several hiding spots available; loaches love enclosed spaces and will sometimes ""hide"" in caves, tubes, and other hidey-holes. Hiding places can be made of wood or rock; strong, sturdy plants are also a good addition.</p><p>Unlike many loach species that are only active at night, the clown loach can be active during the daytime hours though it's likely to be most lively in the early morning and after dark. To watch your loach at play during waking hours, consider installing a blue ""moonlight"" tube or another form of bluish lighting, which will encourage your fish to come out to hunt.  </p><p>Water quality is critical for keeping clown loaches healthy. Take care to keep the water very clean, well-aerated, and warm. An efficient filtration system and frequent water changes are critical. Tank lighting should be subdued, and the substrate should be soft and sandy.</p><p>Loaches are particularly prone to Ich infections; watch them closely whenever new fish or plants are added to the tank. In the unfortunate event that an infection does occur, keep in mind that loaches, like catfish, are very sensitive to some medications. Often dosages must be cut in half to be safe. Read product information carefully before treating any loach.</p><h2>Clown Loach Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Clowns will accept a wide variety of dry and live foods, but their preference is for live foods, especially worms. You can even feed them on earthworms, as long as you harvest the worms from soil that hasn't been fertilized recently. Ideally, you should feed them several small meals throughout the day.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males can be identified by the tail, which is larger, forming a more pointed V-shape, and is more brightly colored. There are very few documented cases of clown loaches breeding in captivity. As a result, very little information is known about their breeding habits and needs.</p><h2>Breeding the Clown Loach </h2><p>Clown loaches rarely or never breed in captivity. If a female does spawn in an aquarium setting, there is an excellent chance that they will not be fertilized and that she or her male counterparts will eat the eggs before they hatch.</p><p>Virtually all clown loaches sold for aquaria are captured in the wild. It's important when buying clown loaches to select only those with bright colors and those fish that are at least a few inches long. At the store, look carefully at the tank to be sure it is well kept and that the fish seem comfortable and healthy. If you see any dead fish, steer clear of the tank system; there is a good chance you'll be buying a loach that is already infected with Ich.</p>",921

Although it has rigid requirements in tankmates, diet, breeding, and water quality, this is a fascinating species to keep.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common names: Chocolate gourami</p><p>Adult size: 2.5 inches</p><p>Life expectancy: 5 to 8 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Chocolate gouramis originate from Borneo, Malacca, the Malaysian Peninsula, and Sumatra. Mainly found in the blackwater peat swamps and adjacent streams of their range, they are also found in clear water areas that are tannin-stained a dark brown color by organic materials. They have a labyrinth organ that allows them to breathe atmospheric air to survive in oxygen-depleted water that might kill most other species.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Like many gourami species, these fish have a flat, oval-shaped body, small head, and pointed mouth. Its common name refers to the dark chocolate brown color of this gourami, which can vary slightly from reddish-brown to greenish-brown. Three to five yellow-white stripes run vertically through the body. The fins are long and edged in yellow, with the caudal fin slightly forked. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>This species is slow-moving and will easily be intimidated or outcompeted for food by larger or more boisterous tankmates. Possible tankmates include peaceful cyprinids such as danios, smaller rasboras like the harlequin rasbora and eye-spot rasbora, or some loaches, such as the kuhli or mini royal loach. Some owners have found them to be good companions for discus, which require similar water conditions and care.</p><p>Gouramis can be very aggressive with each other, and larger tanks are recommended to keep groups of six or more. Generally, these fish do best in pairs or schools of their own kind. They usually live in family groups, and outsiders may not be accepted, but hey are generally peaceful toward other small gentle fish.</p><h2>Chocolate Gourami Habitat and Care </h2><p>Chocolate gouramis can be sensitive to water conditions. Their native habitats are peat swamps and blackwater streams. Such habitats have very low mineral content which results in an extremely low pH, sometimes even below 4.0. The water is very soft and usually dark from decayed organic material.</p><p>Ideally, the chocolate gourami habitat should be well planted with live plants, including floating plants to maintain partial light. The water should be conditioned with peat extract, or filtered through peat. Filtration should not produce strong currents within the tank, so a sponge filter is ideal for this species.Water should be changed often, but only in small amounts (10 percent or less) to avoid major changes in water chemistry.</p><p>Cleanliness should be carefully maintained, as the chocolate gourami is prone to parasites as well as fungal and bacterial infections. Leave a few inches of space above the water surface and the top of the tank, and keep the lid closed tightly. This will produce a layer of humid air near the water surface, on which this species thrives.</p><h2>Chocolate Gourami Diet and Feeding </h2><p>As omnivores, the chocolate gourami will accept most foods. However, they require a well-balanced diet to remain healthy. Algae-based flake foods are essential, in addition to meaty foods. Feed them small live foods when possible. Freeze-dried or frozen brine shrimp, daphnia, or mosquito larvae are all good options.</p><p>It is important to feed the female well before attempting to spawn, as it will go for up to two weeks without food while she holds the eggs. For breeder conditioning, live foods are recommended, as well as high-quality, algae-based flake or pellet food.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male chocolate gouramis are generally larger overall and have larger more developed fins than females. The dorsal fins of males are more pointed, and their anal and caudal fins have a more defined yellow edge than females do. Males also tend to exhibit more reddish-brown coloration.</p><p>The throat of the male is straighter, while females have a more rounded throat and head, presumably to facilitate mouthbrooding. Females will sometimes develop a black spot on the caudal fin.</p><h2>Breeding the Chocolate Gourami </h2><p>Breeding should only be attempted in a species tank, never in a community tank. Owners should be aware that breeding is difficult and water conditions must be carefully adhered to. Always condition the breeder pair with high-quality foods, particularly the female.</p><p>The chocolate gourami is a mouthbrooder, but on rare occasions will create a bubble nest. Spawning begins with the female laying a small number of eggs on the bottom of the tank. The male fertilizes the eggs, followed by the female collecting them in her mouth. Incredibly, males will sometimes assist with this process by picking up fertilized eggs and spitting them toward the female. Once the eggs are collected, the female will incubate them in her mouth for up to two weeks, while the male protects her from predators.</p><p>After the fry are fully formed, the female will spit them out. Newly released fry should be fed frequently on cyclops, rotifers, and freshly hatched brine shrimp. Ideally, the fry should be reared in a separate tank to ensure optimum conditions. However, if the breeding tank is well prepared, with plenty of cover for the fry, they can be reared there.</p><p>Fry are slow-growing and very susceptible to water changes. Some breeders will use plastic wrap around open spaces at the top of the tank to ensure that humidity is high above the water surface. It is believed that the lack of warm humid air can result in the failure of the labyrinth organ to develop properly. Daily small water changes are a must.</p>",915

These slender fish are common in this pet hobby and are easy to manage for most beginner aquarists. These smaller fish tend to be shy around larger, aggressive fish, so keep them in a group and choose their tank mates carefully.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Cherry Barb</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 to 6 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Cherry Barb is native to Sri Lanka. They are found in the Kelani to Nilwala basins. Due to their popularity in the aquarium trade, more vibrantly colored individuals are heavily overfished.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Their characteristic red coloration is more common in male Cherry Barbs during spawning season. Most Cherry Barbs will be primarily tan to dark brown with highlights of red or orange. All Cherry Barbs have a darker line of scales along their midline, right along their lateral line.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Cherry Barbs like to be in small schools, so be sure to plan ahead so there is enough room for 5-6 fish. Suitable tankmates include other barb species, such as the Rosy Barb or Black Ruby Barb. Common tetra species, such as the Neon Tetra or Buenos Aires Tetra also add a splash of color to your tank. There are many peaceful community fishes that are well suited to a tank with the Cherry Barb. Make sure their water parameters match before you bring them home!</p><h2>Cherry Barb Habitat and Care </h2><p>Being a shyer fish, the Cherry Barb likes to have lots of places to hide in their home aquarium. They should be added to your aquarium first, so they can get settled and not have to compete for hiding places.</p><p>Since they like to stick in a group, you may need to make lots of hiding places to accommodate more than one fish at a time. Planted tanks or aquascapes make a great home for Cherry Barbs with good water quality and lots of places to hide.</p><p>Cherry Barbs are relatively easy to care for as long as you keep up with your regular maintenance. In planted tanks, be sure to remove dead plant material regularly and pay attention to any pH changes between day and night.</p><h2>Cherry Barb Diet and Feeding </h2><p>As an omnivore, the Cherry Barb will accept a wide variety of foods. A standard tropical pellet will suffice for most of their nutritional needs. You can supplement with fresh veggies and frozen treats on occasion. Most Cherry Barbs raised in captivity are very well accustomed to a pelleted diet and are not too picky about the type.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>During spawning, Cherry Barb males will turn a vibrant red color. Females tend to be lighter with a darker lateral line bar. Females often get very round as their eggs mature, whereas males tend to stay slender. Your males and females may look very similar if they are not interested in spawning.</p><p>Brian Gratwicke/Flickr</p><p>Beer_Powered/Flickr</p><h2>Breeding the Cherry Barb </h2><p>Thankfully, Cherry Barbs readily breed in captivity and even beginners have good luck getting their fish to spawn. In order to get your Cherry Barbs interested in spawning, you will need to increase your tank's water temperature. Be sure to provide plenty of food to support gender differentiation and development of reproductive products. You will see your male fish take on a brighter red color during this time. If you have lots of boys and only a few girls, things may get very competitive. Try to have more females than males in your school to keep competition limited.</p><p>Cherry Barbs will lay their eggs on various plant materials in the tank. Then the males will follow behind the females and externally fertilize the eggs. Within a few days, the fry will hatch and start swimming around. Beware that other fish and invertebrates will try to eat your new baby fish. If possible, move the plants containing eggs to a separate spawning tank prior to hatching. This will also allow you to feed your new baby fish a better diet for proper development.</p>",679

Cardinal tetras are an active schooling fish, and they live peacefully in a community aquarium. Although they are difficult to breed in captivity, tetras remain a very popular aquarium fish. </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Cardinal tetra, large neon tetra, red neon, roter neon</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 4 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Originating in South America, this species is found from the Orinoco River to the Rio Negro tributary of the Amazon River. It is found as far west as western Colombia. Other locations have also reported schools of cardinals, likely comprised of fish that have escaped from collectors. Manaus, in northern Brazil, is one such location where clusters of cardinals have made themselves at home. Since overfishing this quick-replenishing species would be nearly impossible, Project Piaba's ""Buy a Fish, Save a Tree"" project has become a UN global model for sustainable wild fisheries designed to preserve rainforest habitats.</p><p>The rainforests that cover their waterways are usually very dense and let very little light through. Cardinal tetras favor these shaded areas with slow-moving or standing waters that are very clear. They live in large schools, and it is not unusual to find them in groups numbering into the hundreds. Their native habitat generally has extremely soft, acidic water, often with a pH of 5. They live in shoals, mainly in the middle water layers, where they feed on worms and small crustaceans.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The cardinal tetra has a brilliant neon blue stripe running from the nose to the tail. Below this blue stripe is a brilliant red stripe. The vivid red coloration bleeds into the tail, which is otherwise transparent, as are the other fins. The underbelly is a soft white, setting off this beautifully colored fish.</p><p>A cardinal tetra can be distinguished from a neon tetra by the red color band that extends the entire length of its body. In the neon variety, the red band runs from only the mid-body to tail. Adults will display the best colors when provided with very soft acidic water. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Cardinal tetras, like other tetra species, are a peaceful, social fish that should be kept in schools. Schools should be large, with a minimum size of a half-dozen fish. They are suitable for community tanks as long as water conditions are favorable and other species are peaceful.</p><p>Potential tankmates that may be suitable include other tetra species, danios, rasboras, dwarf gouramis, and small to medium members of the catfish family. Do not keep them with any fish that are known to eat smaller, slim-bodied fish. If the companion fish has a big enough mouth to swallow the cardinal tetra, it is not a suitable tank mate.</p><h2>Cardinal Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Much like the neon tetra, this species requires a mature tank that has soft acidic water. More importantly, water chemistry should be stable. This is not a species that does well in a newly started aquarium.</p><p>The ideal pH is below 6, and the hardness should not be above 4 dGH. Subjecting this species to water that has a high mineral content is a recipe for poor health and shortened lifespans. The water temperature can encompass a broader range, from 73 to 81 degrees F (23 to 27 degrees C).</p><p>Lighting should be subdued as should the décor. Floating plants are a good means for moderating the lighting. Although they require some hiding spaces, it is important to provide them with some open water swimming area as well. A well-planted tank with an open center space is an ideal habitat for this species.  </p><h2>Cardinal Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>The cardinal tetra is an omnivorous species and will accept most foods. These fish have high vitamin requirements, so at least 75 percent of their food should be quality flake food. Cardinal tetras especially appreciate live and frozen foods, but if fed them exclusively they may reject prepared food later on. If only doing one to two feedings a day, offer what they can eat in about five minutes. However, it is better to feed these fish several times a day, offering only what they can eat in about three minutes. All foods should be in small pieces as cardinals have a small mouth. When conditioning breeders, live foods are important.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males and females show few clear differences between the sexes. Females will have a somewhat deeper body with a rounder belly, while males are more slender. Males also have a hook protruding from the anal fin.</p><h2>Breeding the Cardinal Tetra </h2><p>Breeding cardinal tetras is challenging at best. A separate breeding tank is important, and it must have stable water chemistry: a pH of 5.0 to 6.0, and very soft water of 3 to 5 dGH or below is essential. They will spawn in the evening, generally laying between 130 and 500 eggs. Spawning will continue even late into the night hours.</p><p>In approximately 24 hours, the eggs will hatch and live off of the yolk sac for another four to five days. Once the fry is free swimming, feed them infusoria, rotifers, egg yolk, or commercially prepared fry food. Follow this with freshly hatched brine shrimp as the fry grow. Lighting must be kept very low; use floating plants to ensure the tank remains dark. The young tetra fry is highly photo-sensitive.  This species reaches a mature size of up to two inches in home aquaria.</p>",893

They are sometimes confused with the similarly colored peppermint shrimp. They have ornate markings and large reflective eyes. The size of their eyes is an indicator of their natural ability to maneuver in low-light conditions. Despite their beauty, they are capable of wreaking total havoc in reef aquariums.</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Rhynchocinetes uritai</p><p>Rhynchocinetes durbanensis</p><p>Camelback shrimp, hinge beak shrimp, dancing shrimp, candy shrimp, humpback shrimp, and peppermint shrimp (erroneously)</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Camelback shrimp hail from the tropical waters of the East Indian Ocean, Australia, Indonesia, East Pacific, and central/west Pacific. Camelback shrimp are found in small groups in rock crevices, rocky overhangs, coral rubble, and rock caves.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Species coloration and markings may vary, but usually, these shrimp are vibrant cherry-red, and the body is accented with markings of various patterns of bright white dots and/or stripes. A characteristic hump differentiates a camelback shrimp from a peppermint shrimp. Members of this genus also have a pronounced foldable rostrum or beak, which has also earned them the alternative common name of hinge beak shrimp. This beak is usually turned upward.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>These shrimp are good tank cleaners, however, because they eat corals and other polyps, this makes them unsuitable for reef tanks. Do not keep them with zoanthids or other soft corals like colonial anemones, disc anemones, mushroom corals, and soft leather corals. It generally leaves bubble coral and stinging anemones alone. Even a few of these shrimp can decimate a healthy colony of star polyps in no time at all.</p><p>It is usually peaceful towards fish and other invertebrates, but it can be a target for aggressive fish or other invertebrates. Potential fish tankmates can include peaceful fish such as tangs or clownfish.</p><p>Camelback shrimp are very sociable with one another and should be maintained in large colonies of at least six individuals. Avoid keeping alongside fish that prey on crustaceans. </p><h2>Camelback Shrimp Habitat and Care </h2><p>Like most shrimp species, camelback shrimp are a nocturnal crustacean that usually hides during daylight hours, coming out at night to feed. When the light is dim or turned off, you might be able to bring this shrimp out of hiding. It is not unusual to see them picking materials and debris from rocks and other hard surfaces in the aquarium. This type of shrimp is best suited to tanks with an abundance of live rock.</p><p>Supplemental iodine should be added to the system to help with proper molting of this or any shrimp, but with caution. Too much iodine can cause premature molting and shorten its expected lifespan. Regular water changes with a high-quality salt mix usually provide enough supplementation, but additional supplements may be needed in reef tanks or in tanks with heavy invertebrate loads that use up iodine and other minerals rapidly. If water changes with new, fresh saltwater are not done regularly, the minerals can get depleted; Ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates may accumulate and can also be detrimental to the crustaceans and other invertebrates. As with other crustaceans, camelback shrimp cannot tolerate exposure to copper sulfate.</p><p>Also, shrimp tend to molt under environmental stress such as water changes, rapid changes in conditions, or during shipping. Always acclimate shrimp slowly to avoid sudden changes in their environment.</p><h2>Camelback Shrimp Diet </h2><p>This shrimp can be a beneficial tank member as it is a proficient sand-sifter that will feed on waste materials and can generally help keep the tank clean. In the wild, this shrimp is a carnivore. But in captivity, it is more of an omnivore. This shrimp will scavenge at the bottom of the aquarium, filter through the sand, and pick at the debris that settles on rocks and other hard surfaces.</p><p>It will accept a varied diet of prepared fresh and frozen foods suitable for carnivores, vitamin-enriched flakes, fine sinking pellets, freeze-dried krill, frozen or freeze-dried plankton, live adult brine shrimp, mysis shrimp, finely chopped prawn, mussels, clams, or cockle meat, or nauplii (crustacean larvae). It is best if it is fed at least once per day.</p><p>This shrimp will eat corals and other types of polyps.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>The males of this species tend to have larger pincer claws than the females. These shrimp are gonochoristic, which means they have distinct males and females that do not change sex. Females are often seen full of eggs.</p><h2>Breeding the Camelback Shrimp </h2><p>Camelback shrimp do breed in the home aquarium, but raising the young is very challenging. Mating occurs soon after a molt. Mating occurs with the male at a right angle to the female, transferring a package of sperm to a specialized receptacle on the female's abdomen. Six to 20 hours after mating, the female begins to produce a large number of eggs, which she carries under her abdomen. After developing, the eggs are released and eventually hatch into larvae.</p><p>Camelback shrimp needs to undergo molting as it grows. Molting is a process in which Rhynchocinetes uritai sheds its current and tight exoskeleton to replace it with a new and larger one. Camelback shrimp molt at night. The shrimp lies on its back to shed its old exoskeleton. The new exoskeleton is then secreted by its body, which forms and hardens completely in a few hours. The shrimp probably feels vulnerable without its outer shell, so it usually hides in rock crevices or rock caves during the molting process to allow the new exoskeleton to form and completely harden.</p>",894
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/buenos-aires-tetra-1381823,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Buenos Aires Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Buenos Aires Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for the Hobbyist</h2><p>The Buenos Aires tetra is extremely popular due to its hardiness and ease of care. These fish were once sold in large numbers, but due to their propensity for eating aquarium plants, they have become less popular over the years. Specimens are mostly captive-bred from commercial fish farms in Florida.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Buenos Aires tetra, diamond spot characin, red cross fish</p><p>Adult Size: 2.75 inches (7 centimeters)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Buenos Aires tetra derives its name from the capital city of Argentina. The city sits on the western shore of the Río de la Plata, located along the southeastern coastline of South America. Considered a river by some and a gulf by others, the Río de la Plata is formed by the joining of the Paraná and Uruguay Rivers, both of which are home to the Buenos Aires tetra. In the wild, they are additionally found in rivers, ponds, lakes, and streams. They are freshwater fish and do not do well in highly salty or polluted waters. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Buenos Aires tetra is one of the larger tetras as it can grow to nearly three inches in size. Its body is silvery with a narrow blue line that starts behind the gill and ends at the caudal (tail) fin, where there is a black diamond-shaped spot. The fins are orange-red and a splash of red can be seen at the top of the eye. Several color variations have been bred including one that has a yellow tail; there is also an albino variety.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Buenos Aires tetras are social fish that swim in schools. Although this species of tetra is generally peaceful, avoid keeping Buenos Aires tetras with smaller fish such as the neon tetra. Also, avoid housing them with long-finned fish such as the betta and angelfish. Buenos Aires tetras will nip at the fins of long-finned tankmates.</p><p>The Buenos Aires tetra does well with larger sized tetras, such as the black widow or serpae tetra, as well as with barbs, danios, gouramis, and rainbowfish. Bottom-dwelling fish are also good companions. A school of Buenos Aires tetras are also good dither fish among non-aggressive cichlids; they help relax cichlids enough to come out of hiding.</p><h2>Buenos Aires Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>The undemanding Buenos Aires tetra is adaptable to a range of aquarium conditions. Acceptable water temperatures can span all the way from the mid-60s to 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it suitable for heated as well as unheated tanks. It is a highly active fish, and it does require a sizable open swimming space. Longer tanks are ideal.</p><p>The Buenos Aires tetra is not suitable for most live planted tanks, however, as it is known to devour vegetation. Use artificial plants instead, or select sturdy live plants such as anubias, Java fern, or vallisneria. Round out the décor with driftwood and rocks around the periphery of the tank, and your Buenos Aires tetras will be quite at home.</p><p>They are happy with any type of substrate and do fine with normal aquarium lighting. However, the tank should be securely covered as these fish are skilled jumpers and will probably do so if given the opportunity.</p><p>The Buenos Aires tetra is extra sensitive to the nitrates and phosphates that build up over time, and water hardness increases due to evaporation. To combat these ever-changing conditions, water should be replaced on a regular basis. At least 25 to 50 percent of the tank water should be replaced every other week especially if the tank is densely stocked.</p><h2>Buenos Aires Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Buenos Aires tetras are omnivores that will accept a wide variety of foods. Feed these tetras several times a day but feed only what they can consume in three minutes or less at each feeding.</p><p>In the wild, they primarily feed on worms, crustaceans, insects, and plants, but in the aquarium, they will generally eat all kinds of live, fresh, and flake foods. Given its propensity for eating live plants, provide this fish with some lettuce, spinach, or other vegetation to munch on. In lieu of fresh vegetation, you can provide a good quality spirulina flake food.</p><p>Flake, dried, and freeze-dried foods add well-needed variety to their diet and will be readily accepted. To keep these tetras at their best and most colorful, offer live foods such as bloodworms, daphnia, brine shrimp, and mosquito larvae. </p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males of the species have brighter, redder fins and are generally more colorful overall, particularly during spawning. Females are larger and broader with a rounder belly. </p><h2>Breeding the Buenos Aires Tetra </h2><p>Buenos Aires tetras are easy to breed; they are egg scattering fish that can be spawned in pairs or in groups. If spawned in a group, use approximately the same number of males as females. A mature female's belly will become nicely rounded when she is full of eggs. Choose males that are the most colorful.</p><p>Condition all spawning fish with live foods prior to spawning attempts. Keep the water slightly acidic to neutral with a pH of 6.5 to 7.2; keep the water temperature at 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Gentle filtration, such a sponge filter is recommended. Provide sturdy plants such as Java moss or spawning mops on which the fish will scatter their adhesive eggs.</p><p>This species will usually begin to spawn at dawn. Females may lay as many as 2,000 eggs, depositing them on the plants or green floss. Remove the adults once the eggs have been laid. After spawning, these fish exhibit no parental care and will eat the eggs and young, so make this your separate rearing tank.</p><p>The eggs will hatch in approximately 24 hours. In three to four days the fry will have consumed their egg sacs and will be free swimming. Initially, feed the fry infusoria or commercially prepared fry food such as Liquifry. As they grow larger, feed them freshly hatched brine shrimp, micro worms, or finely ground high-quality flake food or fry food.</p>",977
135,https://www.thesprucepets.com/brownbanded-bamboo-shark-profile-2925522,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Brownbanded Bamboo Shark Breed Profile</h1>,"<h1>Brownbanded Bamboo Shark Breed Profile</h1><p>If you're an experienced aquarist, chances are good that you've considered the idea of owning a pet shark. While most sharks are far too big for a home aquarium, the Brownbanded Bamboo Shark is an exception to the rule. At about 41 inches long, it can be kept in a large 180-gallon tank along with other compatible fish, and it often does well in captivity. The only real challenges in keeping these sharks relate to feeding and health issues: You may need to ""target feed"" your shark to be sure it eats properly and to provide it with medications needed to maintain its health.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Brownbanded Bamboo Shark, Brown-Banded, Banded, Brown-Spotted, Black Banded, Blackbanded Bamboo Shark, Cat Shark</p><p>Adult Size: 41 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: About 20-25 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Brownbanded Bamboo Shark originates in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean. It may be found from Japan to northern Australia and prefers depths of about 275 feet. These sharks frequent coral reefs where they find plentiful prey.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>These impressive sharks sport barbels around their noses, and these ""whiskers"" are the source of one of their common names: cat shark. The barbels are sensory organs that help the fish to find food. The young have the beautiful banded markings, but these fade with maturity, and adults may be grey with black stripes or cream colored with brown stripes; they may develop brown spots between their less-prominent stripes. They grow to more than 40 inches long when fully grown.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>This species is not reef-safe: it will nip at and eat crustaceans, coral and smaller, less aggressive tankmates. As a result, it's a good idea to keep your Brownbanded Bamboo Shark in a fish-only aquarium with relatively large, aggressive species that can hold their own with a shark. Good tankmates include eels, groupers, snappers, hawkfish, hogfish, rabbitfish, lionfish/scorpions, grunts/sweetlips, sharks and rays, large angelfish, parrotfish, and tangs/surgeonfishes. Triggerfish and pufferfish are not good options to pair with this shark: they will nip at the sharks' fins and cause them undue stress.</p><h2>Brownbanded Bamboo Shark Habitat and Care </h2><p>Being a nocturnal, bottom-dwelling species that inhabits deeper waters where little light is present, the Brownbanded Bamboo Shark is light sensitive. Typically it stays hidden in an aquarium with bright lights on, and therefore it should be provided with an adequately sized cave or light-sheltered space where it can hide. Course textures can scratch this shark's belly, which can lead to infection, so it requires a soft sand substrate. Poor aquarium water quality can be problematic for this species.</p><p>Being docile fish that do not swim around much, Brownbanded Bamboo Sharks are nevertheless strong fish that can easy dislodge unstable rock formations and corals that are not attached securely. To avoid possible damage to the structure of the aquarium and injury to the shark and its tankmates, all items should be stable.</p><h2>Brownbanded Bamboo Shark Diet </h2><p>Like all sharks, Brownbanded Bamboo Sharks are carnivores and should be fed a meaty diet that includes pieces of fresh shrimp, scallop, squid, and marine fish flesh.</p><p>Soaking foods in a liquid vitamin provides a boost in vitamins and minerals important to the sharks' health. They also require a supplemental source of iodine to prevent goiter disease.</p><p>Because they are fairly docile, they do not compete well for food with aggressive feeders. If they are sharing a tank, you may need to offer them food directly, using a stick or tongs. They should be fed until satisfied two to three times a week. Brownbanded Bamboo Sharks have a small mouth and cannot open it very wide. They do not bite off pieces of food. They should be given tiny bits of food that they can easily consume whole, otherwise, they may ignore and even spit out chunks that are too large.</p><p>It can be difficult to get juveniles to eat. Adding a natural scent and flavor enhancer such as Seachem Entice and introducing live farm-raised saltwater feeder shrimp (white shrimp) to the aquarium can help to pique a stubborn feeder's interest.</p><p>It is not unusual for a baby or a juvenile specimen to not start eating right away, and the shark may starve to death if not given the proper diet. Before buying one of these sharks, be sure it is healthy, and make sure that it is eating the offered food.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Males' pelvic fins have tube-shaped organs called claspers. These organs deliver sperm into the female's reproductive tract.</p><h2>Breeding the Brownbanded Bamboo Shark </h2><p>Bamboo or cat sharks are egg-layers, with the eggs enclosed in elongated flattened egg-cases. It's not unusual to find the eggs for sale; in captivity, hatching one can take up to four months. If you are seriously interested in breeding these sharks, you will need to dedicate quite a bit of time to properly managing the process of hatching and caring for juveniles.</p><h2>Health Concerns </h2><p>This species of shark is prone to developing a goiter, which is a swelling of the thyroid gland that appears on the outside of the throat area. Starting out as a small lump, over time it can develop into a very large growth that blocks the shark's throat, which prevents it from eating. A goiter is the result of the lack of iodine in the shark's diet. It takes many months for one to develop and takes just as long to reverse it.</p><p>It's important to take steps to supplement the shark's diet with needed iodine when a goiter is first noticed. If left alone, the goiter may grow too large, and at this point it's too late to save the shark and the animal slowly dies from starvation. Copper-based medications should never be used on this shark, so be sure to read the labels on products carefully.</p>",943

These fish are easy to care for and hardy, but they are somewhat shy.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Bronze cory, green cory</p><p>Adult Size: 2.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>These fish are found in South America from Colombia and Trinidad in the north as far south as the Río de la Plata drainage at the border of Uruguay and Argentina. Bronze corys mostly inhabit slow-moving rivers and streams and prefer areas with shallow, muddy water, however, they have also been found in fast-flowing rivers. </p><p>With a special ability to breathe air from the surface of the water, cory catfish are one of the few fish that can thrive in stagnant water. In the home aquarium, you will often see them darting to the surface to take a quick gulp of air and then dive back down to the bottom.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Small, active, and peaceful, the bronze cory is just a color variation of the same species known as the green cory. In addition to color variations of green, bronze, albino, and even black, this species is one of many fish that is sometimes injected with dye to enhance its color. Do not purchase any fish specimens that are suspected of being color-dyed as this causes long-term health problems for the fish. It is also wise to avoid any that have damaged barbels, or those having a sunken belly, which indicates inadequate feeding and susceptibility to disease.</p><p>Like all corydoras, this species is armored with overlapping scales known as plates or scutes. Their fins possess a leading spine, which can be locked in place to make it difficult for larger fish to swallow them. This spine can also make netting them difficult, and care should be taken when doing so. In the home aquarium, corys are prized for being charmingly expressive.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Bronze corys are a schooling fish. Keep them in groups of at least five. Cory catfish tankmates may include most community tank species as long as they are non-aggressive and friendly in nature. Otocinclus catfish, tetras, swordtails, and other corys can be a good fit. Avoid putting corys in the same tank with oscars, Texas cichlids, or Jack Dempseys. These species can injure corys or may try to eat them.</p><h2>Bronze Corydoras Habitat and Care </h2><p>Bronze corys tolerate a wide variety of water conditions. However, they prefer acid to neutral pH, soft to slightly hard water, and temperatures in the middle 70s. They are not tolerant of salt and should always be moved if the tank is going to treated using salt. </p><p>All corys like to dig in the substrate in search of food. To avoid irritation to their barbels, use small, smooth-edged gravel or sand as the substrate. They tend to be shy and should be provided with hiding places (preferably of wood or stone), as well as floating plants to subdue the lighting. They prefer low water levels similar to the shallow waters near the banks of the Amazon tributaries that are their native habitat.</p><h2>Bronze Corydoras Diet and Feeding </h2><p>In the wild, corys mainly feed on small crustaceans, worms, and insects. Bronze corys are omnivorous and will accept everything from flake to frozen foods. To maintain their good health, a variety of foods should be offered, including their favorite live foods: bloodworms, blackworms, daphnia, and brine shrimp. </p><p>Corys tend to ignore live foods that remain near the surface of the water. They are bottom feeders, which can prove to be a problem; other fish may consume most of the food before it reaches the bottom. Owners should use tongs to place foods lower and then closely observe at feeding time to ensure the corys are getting a sufficient amount of food.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>It can be tough to tell the difference between a female and male bronze corydoras. Males tend to be smaller and more slender than females, particularly when viewed from the top. A female will be larger due to her more rounded abdominal area.</p><h2>Breeding the Bronze Corydoras  </h2><p>Spawning bronze corys is relatively easy. Purchasing a half dozen or more young specimens at the same time will ensure having at least one or two breeding pairs.</p>",709
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bristlenose-catfish-1380837,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Bristlenose Pleco Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Bristlenose Pleco Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>There are many species of catfishes in the family Loricariidae, and several have become prominent within the aquarium hobby. The popularity of the Bristlenose Pleco is is attributed to the fact that they stay small compared to other common catfish, such as the common pleco ,which can grow to 18-20 inches in length. The bristle nose pleco usually reaches only five inches in length.</p><h3>What Is a Plecostomus?</h3><p>Plecostomus, commonly called plecos, belong to the Family Loricariidae, which has over 680 species and is the largest family of catfish. Many plecostomus species can breathe by swallowing air at the water surface and absorbing oxygen from their digestive tract. Native to Central and South America, these species of catfish are characterized by the intricate patterns on their armored bodies, and sucker-shaped mouths used to eat algae.</p><p>Having a diet of vegetation makes plecos an ideal aquarium addition. They are terrific tank cleaners who will ""vacuum"" the substrate on a daily basis. As peaceful and sociable fish, plecos fit into community tanks nicely. The Bristlenose Pleco is not only an easy fish to care for; it's also unique in appearance and fun to watch.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Bristlenose pleco, bristlenose catfish, bushynose catfish, bushy nose</p><p>Adult Size: 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5-10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Bristlenose Pleco originates in South America, mainly in the fast-flowing waters of the Amazon River Basin. Other species of catfishes can be found in other parts of South and Central America, including Panama.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Bristlenose Pleco is one of the smallest catfish, growing to only 5 inches. They are brown, green, or gray with white or yellow spots; some have uneven coloring, with lighter and darker splotches on various parts of their bodies. Most have lighter abdomens and darker backs (with the exception of the albino Bristlenose, which is mostly yellowish). This species has an unusual appearance, featuring bony plates, a flat, fat body, and a wide head with an ""underbite"" to the set of the lower mandible.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Any peaceful fish are fine tank mates for Bristlenose Plecos, and they can be kept together with other algae eaters, like snails or grazing fish. They are great for community tanks with species like Neon Tetras, Platys, Guppys, and more. Some aquarists even pair them with known aggressors, such as bettas or African cichlids, and even with competitive fish like goldfish. However, when plecos reach maturity the males can be highly territorial around each other.</p><h2>Bristlenose Pleco Habitat and Care </h2><p>Naturally, Bristlenose Plecos prefer water that is well aerated with some sort of current. Because they are bottom dwellers, make sure to provide plenty of driftwood, roots, plants, and caves for them to hide in during the day. They are nocturnal and prefer to do their eating mostly at night. Driftwood can provide a good substrate on which algae will consistently grow, giving the Bristlenose Pleco a sufficient amount of food. Although they are herbivores, they will not harm live plants.</p><p>Bristlenose Plecos do well in a tank of 20 gallons or larger and can handle a wide range of water conditions from soft and acidic to harder and alkaline. Some hobbyists have found success with Bristlenose Plecos in Cichlid tanks. This may hold true, but it would be best not to keep them with larger Central and South American Cichlids. If you're looking to breed them, do not add into a tank with substrate spawning Cichlids because the Cichlids are likely to devour their eggs.</p><h2>Bristlenose Pleco Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Bristlenose Plecos are herbivores, eating mainly algae, so feeding algae or spirulina wafers once or twice daily is best. Granules, flakes, or bloodworms are also good, while the occasional zucchini slices and blanched romaine lettuce or spinach are good treats. Just make sure to never overfeed. Well-fed plecos have good coloration so it's easy to tell when their nutritional needs are being met. Like all catfish, the Bristlenose Pleco will also spend some of its time foraging through the substrate for algae and other detritus; this, of course, is a great plus as it results in a much cleaner tank.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>This species is relatively easy to breed, and it's quite easy, as well, to determine gender. Both males and females have fleshy tentacles around the snout, thus earning the name bristlenose, but males have large bristles on their heads. Males are usually larger, and also have spikes on their fins.</p><h2>Breeding the Bristlenose Pleco </h2><p>Breeding conditions are fairly simple; in fact, the normal tank habitat is nearly ideal. To encourage mating, however, you will probably want to add caves or driftwood to your Bristlenose Plecos' habitat. Once males mature, they will claim a territory that is most suitable for spawning.</p><p>The next step is for the female to arrive and lay her eggs during mating season. It's best to do a 75 percent water change to promote mating; their natural mating season is during the Amazon's rainy season, and the change of water can spur mating behaviors (November best aligns with the natural timing of the mating season). The male will defend his territory from other males until a mate finally shows up. Often, fights between males result in their bristles getting tangled together.</p><p>Once ready to breed, the female lays her eggs in the male's territory. Eggs are stuck onto hard surfaces such as driftwood, ceilings of caves, PVC piping, or a suitable tank decoration. The male will guard the spawning area for the 5 to 10 days it takes for the eggs to hatch. After hatching, the fry will absorb their egg yolk for a few days, and once finished with that, they will move on immediately to eating algae.</p>",938

The Blue Green Chromis is reef safe (it won't eat the reef invertebrates) and gets along with most other fish. </p><p>The Blue Green Chromis is a relatively inexpensive, easy to care for, and hardy saltwater species. Although a smaller reef species, Blue Green Chromis fish are active and inquisitive, so they are generally out and about in the tank. For all these reasons, the Blue Green Chromis is a great choice for beginners looking to add color and flash to a saltwater aquarium. </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Blue Green Chromis, Green Chromis, Blue-Green Reef Chromis</p><p>Scientific Name: </p><p>Adult Size: 3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 to 12 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Blue Green Chromis fish is found in tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean, east of the Philippines, New Guinea and eastern Australia. Blue Green Chromis live in coral reef areas and lagoons where they prefer to group into a school.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The color of the Blue Green Chromis is a pale, shimmery light blue-green with an iridescent overlay. Male Blue Green Chromis will sometimes change colors during spawning turning pale yellow when they are ready to begin building a nest. Some individuals may have darker markings on their fins. Typically, the juvenile Blue Green Chromis that are available for purchase at fish stores range from one to two inches, and can grow up to three inches long.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A relatively peaceful species, Blue Green Chromis should be kept in a small school. They can be kept with most other saltwater fish excluding large predatory fish that might eat the smaller Blue Green Chromis. When planning what fish to add to an aquarium, always add the most peaceful fish species first, working your way up to the most aggressive fish species you plan to keep. This helps limit fighting amongst fish due to territory issues. Be sure to check that your water chemistry values are appropriate for the different species before mixing fish as well.</p><p>Blue Green Chromis may snack on tiny, juvenile invertebrates like shrimp and crabs, but will not bother larger invertebrates. These fish leave corals alone, so this species does well in reef tanks as well as fish only tanks.</p><h2>Blue Green Chromis Habitat and Care </h2><p>Like most damselfish, Blue Green Chromis are quite hardy, making them a good choice for newer aquarists. Unlike other species of damselfish, Blue Green Chromis are relatively docile, and get along well with many other reef species. They are active swimmers, so when keeping Blue Green Chromis in reef tanks, make sure your décor allows plenty of space for swimming in the middle to top of the tank. Blue Green Chromis do like having a place to rest or hide, so ensure they have a small cave or crack to call their own if they choose to take a break.</p><p>A small group of Blue Green Chromis will tend to school together or may join up with other small, schooling reef fishes. Even though Blue Green Chromis are small, if you wish to keep a school, your tank should be large enough to provide plenty of swimming space. Overcrowding a saltwater aquarium contributes to territory spats between fish, poor water quality and poor fish health.</p><h2>Blue Green Chromis Diet and Feeding  </h2><p>Blue Green Chromis are omnivores, which means they eat both meaty and plant foods. For most reef tanks, feeding a varied diet is the best way to provide complete, balanced nutrition. Feed a mix of meaty and herbivore foods, including flakes, pellets and frozen foods.</p><p>Feed your fish a few small meals per day, taking care not to overfeed. Saltwater fish are natural foragers, eating very small amounts throughout the day. Once a day, large feedings are not the best option for maintaining a healthy digestive system. A surplus of uneaten food in your saltwater aquarium will contribute to poor water quality and unwanted marine algae growth. Always watch your fish closely during feeding time to ensure all of your fish are getting enough to eat, not being bullied, and are not injured or sick.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Male and female Blue Green Chromis fish do not have reliable discernable physical differences. However, mature males may change color during spawning, turning a lighter yellow, but this may not always occur.</p><h2>Breeding of the Blue Green Chromis Fish </h2><p>Blue Green Chromis will sometimes breed in captivity if aquarium conditions are ideal and the eggs and fry are kept safe. It is best to move a breeding pair of individuals to a separate breeding tank in order to ensure survival of the offspring. A separate aquarium also allows you to manipulate temperature and light levels, key factors to stimulate fish to breed.</p><p>Blue Green Chromis males will prepare a nest in the sand bed into which more than one female will lay a large number of eggs. During external fertilization, males will spray their sperm on the eggs, then tend to the nest and protect the eggs until they hatch just a few days later. Unfertilized eggs or those that do not hatch are usually eaten by the male.</p><p>Once the Chromis eggs hatch, remove the adults to prevent them from eating their young. Fry require a diet high in fat and protein in order to ensure proper development.</p>",908

A color variation of the three spot gourami, they sport only two spots one in the center of the body and a second at the caudal pentacle (beginning of the tail). Where is the third spot? It's the eye! Usually silvery blue, their colors change considerably with their moods. During spawning, they acquire a much deeper blue hue. The opaline or cosby hybrid variation lacks spots, has a darker blue marbling, and is rarely available for sale.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Blue gourami, gold gourami, opaline gourami, cosby gourami, giant gourami, siamese gourami</p><p>Adult Size: 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This widespread species occurs naturally throughout southeast Asia. It may be found in the Mekong River basin in southern China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Sumatra, Java, and Kalimantan. Outside of its native range, it has been introduced in Sulawesi, Philippines, Taiwan, Papua New Guinea, and the islands of Reunion, Seychelles, Namibia, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. The blue gourami frequents shallow lowland marshes, swamps, and peatlands, but may also be found in streams and canals or, during flood season, in flooded forests.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The blue gourami, which is usually whitish-blue, is a natural color variation of the brown or lavender gourami. It has two spots one in the center of its body and the other at the base of the tail. If these spots start to fade, it's likely your fish is experiencing metabolic stress caused by overcrowding or poor water conditions.</p><p>The species has a long, flattened body with large, rounded fins as well as a labyrinth organ that allow them to breathe air directly. Adult males reach up to five inches in length and females are slightly larger. The scientific name  is derived from the Greek words trichiasis (hairy) and pteron (wing), referring to their long, hair-like pelvic fins in which touch-sensitive cells are located.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Blue gouramis are territorial and can clash with certain species. Avoid dwarf gouramis, guppies, goldfish, angelfish, and bettas. Better options include tetras, loaches, danios, mollies, platies, barbs, and scavenger catfish. Select species of a similar size to the blue gouramis to avoid aggressive behaviors. </p><h2>Blue Gourami Habitat and Care </h2><p>Blue gouramis are one of the hardiest of the gourami family. Their preference is for thickly vegetated waters of any type, as their natural habitat includes ditches, canals, ponds, swamps, rivers, and lakes.</p><p>Blue gouramis tolerate a wide range of temperatures and are not demanding in terms of water conditions. However, they prefer soft, slightly acidic water during the breeding season.</p><p>Young blue gouramis need tanks no bigger than 15 to 20 gallons, but as they grow to adulthood they will need 35 gallons. Though they do have a labyrinth organ and can breathe air if absolutely necessary, it is important to keep the tank well-filtered; you can also add air stones to improve oxygenation. You may want to provide a darker substrate simply because it makes such a pretty contrast against the colors of the blue gourami.</p><h2>Blue Gourami Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Blue gouramis are exceptionally easy to feed as they will accept virtually any foods, from flake to freeze-dried to live foods. They will consume hydra voraciously and are prized for their ability to eliminate this pest from the home aquarium.</p><h2>Gender Differences  </h2><p>Sexes are primarily differentiated by the shape of the dorsal fin, which is long and pointed in males compared to the females' shorter rounded dorsal fin. Females that are prepared for spawning will show a pronounced swelling, while the male will have a far more slender girth. Both sexes display a much deeper blue color during breeding periods.</p><p>Because the male can be rather aggressive during spawning, the aquarium habitat should provide ample places for the female to take refuge. Failure to do so can result in injury to females.</p><h2>Breeding the Blue Gourami </h2><p>Spawning begins with the building of a bubble nest by the male, which usually occurs early in the day. After a suitable nest has been prepared, the male will attempt to entice the female under it by swimming back and forth, flaring his fins and raising his tail. The female signals her readiness by biting his back; he responds by repeatedly brushing his back against her belly before wrapping her into a spawning embrace.</p><p>During spawning, the male wraps his body tightly around the female, turning her on her side or back so the eggs will rise unimpeded to the surface. This close embrace is also important because it brings the reproductive elements as close together as possible. Because sperm cells survive only a matter of minutes in the water, the timing of their release and proximity to the eggs is critical.</p><p>Just before the sperm is released, the pair may be observed quivering a sure sign that spawning is near completion. The eggs are released immediately thereafter and are fertilized by the time they reach the bubble nest. The pair may repeat the process a number of times over the course of several hours. It is not unusual for the number of eggs produced to reach into the thousands.</p><p>Once spawning is complete, the female's involvement is over; remove her to prevent an attack by the male. From this point forward until they hatch, the male will tend the eggs, carefully rearranging them and returning any errant eggs back to the nest. The male gourami may spit streams of water, an interesting phenomenon, often seen during breeding. It is believed that the purpose of this behavior is to keep the eggs positioned within the bubble nest.</p><p>The eggs hatch in approximately 30 hours. Feed the fry infusoria and nauplii. Perform frequent water changes as the fry grow, especially during the third week which is when the labyrinth organ develops.</p>",959

They vary in color significantly, with one genus containing blennies with venomous fangs! Once they have a happy cave to call their own, blennies are a peaceful addition to many well-secured community saltwater tanks.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Blenny</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 6 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>There are many different genera and species of blennies. ""True"" blennies are members of the order Blenniiformes. They are found in many areas of the world and in recent years some species have now been allowed to be bred in captivity.</p><p>The genus is made up of venomous blenny species. They have venomous fangs that they use for self-defense. If you own these species, please be aware of your blennies when cleaning the tank or moving decor. Do not let children put their hands in the tank and never hand feed them.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Blenny colorations vary widely. Most blennies have elongated bodies and many use their pectoral fins as props to rest on the bottom of your tank and decor.</p><p>Depending on your species of blenny, they may be one color throughout, such as the Canary Blenny, or have a mottled color to blend into their background, such as the Sailfin Blenny. Unlike other common reef species, blennies may be dark or bright in their color pattern.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Blennies are semi-aggressive fish and do well with many other semi-aggressive community reef species. They are coral safe but will often hunt small plankton living on the surface of algae and live rock.</p><p>Blennies like having a territory to call their own, so they do not do well with small, similarly minded species, such as dottybacks and damselfish. They will use those venomous fangs on their tankmates if they are scared or stressed. Once they have a happy home, they are usually very easy-going community tankmates.</p><h2>Blenny Habitat and Care </h2><p>For happy blennies, it is critical to provide them with lots of tiny nooks and crannies. Since they are small, they will not compete for larger caves with large, semi-aggressive fish. You may notice your blenny digging their own cave under rocks and live rock through their gravel or sand.</p><p>As with all saltwater systems, proper water quality is crucial for fish health. Keep up with a regular maintenance schedule, keeping in mind that your blennies may be hiding in your cleaning area. Especially with venomous blennies, you need to know where your fish are hiding!</p><p>Blennies have been known to jump out of their tanks, so a tight-fitting lid is vital. Do not dismiss their small size thinking they will not leap from their resting spots high up on decor during maintenance or feeding.</p><h2>Blenny Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Thankfully, blennies are not known for being picky eaters. They do well with many saltwater community diets. Some specific species of blenny may fall more towards the herbivorous or carnivorous end of the fish spectrum, but most are omnivores.</p><p>Venomous blennies forage more in the middle of the water column compared to other blenny species that focus on bottom-feeding. For most saltwater community tanks, broadcast feeding across a wide area of the tank is best to make sure that everyone gets enough to eat without too much competition.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Some species of blenny, such as the Sailfin Blenny, are sexually dimorphic by color, with males being darker than females. But for many species, there are no overt external cues. Sometimes, female blennies are larger than males, but this is not a uniform rule.</p><h2>Breeding the Blenny </h2><p>Since it is hard to determine male vs. female blennies, it can be very difficult to start breeding programmes. They can form harems, with one male reproducing with multiple females, so it is recommended to add several individuals to the breeding tank, giving them many caves and crevices, and let them form their own groups.</p><p>One male blenny may court one or multiple females. Once the females lay their eggs, the male may tend them in a common nest. Larvae hatch within seven to ten days and require supplementation while remaining in the breeding tank.</p>",690
57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/black-widow-tetra-1381829,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Black Widow Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Black Widow Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>Hardy and easy to care for, the black widow tetra (or black skirt tetra) is a schooling fish that, contrary to its name, comes in several colors. While the wild black widow tetra is dark in color, consider the many-colored varieties that have been captive-bred. At least six or seven specimens create a healthy, happy school of fish, but avoid housing them with smaller species (particularly those with long, flowing fins) as black widows do sometimes nip. This active, fast-moving species is a great choice for aquarium beginners.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black tetra, black skirt</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Black widow tetras originate from the small, slower tributaries and creeks of the Guapore and Paraguay Rivers in Brazil, where the forest canopy provides both shade and food. They congregate near the surface of the water where they eat insects, crustaceans, and small worms. Originally they were only available as wild-caught, but all specimens sold now are entirely captive-bred, leading to a number of new man-made variations of this popular fish.</p><p>Other variants of the black widow tetra include the longfin blackskirt tetra, the goldenskirt tetra, and the colored skirt tetra. Additionally, similar species have often been mistaken for this fish, including Socolof's tetra and the false black tetra . Both of these species are not as frequently available in the aquarium trade, nor are they as popular as the black widow tetra.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>One of the best-known members of the tetra family, the black widow tetra is easily recognized by the distinctive black dorsal and anal fins, and by the vertical black stripes on the body. Naturally occurring color variations can be white to pinkish-hued. But a number of different colored strains, as well as long-finned varieties, have been produced by captive breeding.</p><p>Don't be fooled by any number of pastel-colored specimens; these fish have been achieved with dyes. Avoid any individuals that may have been artificially colored as they are much more susceptible to disease. Contrary to some reports, the process of dying is stressful to the fish, and this stress shortens its lifespan a great deal. Purchasing these fish only serves to support this unethical and harmful practice.</p><p>Black widow tetras remain relatively small, reaching an adult length of approximately two inches. Hybrids, such as the long-finned varieties, tend to be a bit larger. Once the black widow tetra achieves its mature size at approximately one year, its normal dark coloration will slowly begin to fade into a silvery gray. By the time the fish has reached five years or more in age, it is usually quite pale in color. These fish also pale when they are stressed or ill. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A schooling fish by nature, black widow tetras are best kept in groups of six or more. They make an excellent community fish due to their peaceful nature. Some owners report that they sometimes nip the fins of slower-moving fish, particularly those with long, flowing fins such as bettas or angelfish.</p><h2>Black Widow Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Black widows are an undemanding species that adapt to a range of conditions, though subdued lighting and neutral-colored gravel substrates are preferred. They are accustomed to large plants in their natural habitat and enjoy a well-planted aquarium with some open swimming space.</p><p>Although not demanding about water, they prefer soft, acidic water, preferably tannin-stained. Ideally, you should initially match them to the water conditions from the supplier, as sudden changes are not tolerated by this species. Colder water can stress tetras, leaving them quite vulnerable to a number of diseases such as Ich.</p><h2>Black Widow Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Black widow tetras readily accept virtually any food, including live, fresh, frozen, freeze-dried, or flake foods. For the breed's optimal health, provide a variety of foods, which can include high-quality flake foods, brine shrimp, and any type of worms, as well as vegetable supplements and spirulina.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Female black widows are generally larger than the males and have a rounder body. In the female, the anal fin runs parallel with the vertical black stripe on the abdomen. Males occasionally have white spots on the caudal fin; they are smaller, have a broader anal fin, and a narrower, more pointed dorsal fin.</p><h2>Breeding the Black Widow Tetra </h2><p>Black widow tetras may be spawned in groups that have a few more males than females; they may also be spawned as pairs. Condition all spawning fish, either the pairs or groups, with live foods. If you do not have live foods available to you, you can substitute frozen live food.</p><p>This species prefers to scatter their adhesive eggs among vegetation, so provide plenty of fine-leaved plants such as Java Moss or spawning mops. Keep the water temperature at 78 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit in a dimly lit tank.</p><p>Larger males generally claim a territory that they will guard during their spawning periods. Once spawning has occurred, remove the parents as they will quickly consume the eggs.</p><p>Eggs will hatch after approximately one day. Feed the fry freshly hatched brine shrimp, egg yolk, or finely ground flake foods. Black widow tetras do not reach their sexual maturity until nearly two years of age.</p>",870
48,https://www.thesprucepets.com/black-phantom-tetra-1381828,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Black Phantom Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Black Phantom Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The black phantom tetra comes from northern Paraguay and central Brazil. It is a peaceful schooling fish and a great choice for a community aquarium. The black phantom tetra gets its name from its ""eye patch"" behind the gills as if a phantom is peering back at you. Although the males are mostly a smokey-silver, the females display some brilliant color. If you add these fish to your aquarium you may even get the chance to observe ""mock fight"" displays between males. No fish are harmed, and the events can be interesting to watch.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black phantom petra, phantom tetra</p><p>Adult Size: 1 3/4 inches (4 1/2 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The black phantom tetra makes its home in South America in Bolivia and in areas of western Brazil including the Guaporé River basin and Rio Sao Francisco. In some areas, such as Guapore (Brazil) and Paraguay, they can be found in clear waters that flow into the wetlands of Pantanal. In other areas, however, they prefer slow-moving, murky waters that are thick with vegetation. Black phantom tetras are shoaling fish that live in large groups. In the wild, they eat insects, worms, and crustaceans. The species is under no threat and is widely distributed.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Black phantoms make a stunning contrast fish when paired with their red-hued cousins such as the red phantom, jewel, or serpae tetras. They have an attractive, flat, oval body that is silvery gray with a distinctive, vertical splash of black-edged on its front and back with a bluish-white just behind the gills. An odd location for an eye-spot, this splash almost resembles the coloring of a human eye. The real eye of this fish is edged in black on the top and bottom.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Black phantom tetras swim in large groups in the wild, so they do best in groups of at least eight or more in captivity. They also do well with other tetras and look particularly striking when paired with the red phantom tetra. Black phantoms are also compatible with other peaceful species but can be threatened by more aggressive fish. Some good options for tankmates include other live-bearing fish such as gouramis, danios, rasboras, or small, non-aggressive cichlids. Peaceful bottom-dwellers can also share their habitat.</p><h2>Black Phantom Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Phantoms prefer a well-planted tank (particularly floating plants), subdued lighting, and a dark substrate such as river sand. You may want to include some dried leaves and driftwood in the tank. Change the water frequently as they are sensitive to poor water quality.</p><p>Black phantom tetras are a very active species, so they do best in a tank that is at least 40 inches in length. It's a good idea to have a tight-fitting cover, as black phantom tetras can and do jump. Water parameters are not critical and may be soft to hard, acidic to slightly alkaline.</p><p>It is not unusual for the mildly hierarchical males to claim small territories and quarrel with other males at the edges of their turf. Tussles can be intriguing to watch, as the behavior involves unusual ""mirroring"" that sometimes looks like tandem swimming. The battles are minor and pass without injury, however, frequent challenges add to a state of chronic stress that will shorten life spans. If fish are in conflict daily, rebuild your system into a larger tank.</p><h2>Black Phantom Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Black phantoms are happy eaters, and they will accept most foods. Give them a varied diet of fine flake and freeze-dried foods, as well as small live foods such as brine shrimp, to keep them in optimum health.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Males can be identified by their longer fins and total lack of red color. Adult males have black fins or fins that are edged in black; the dorsal, ventral, and anal fins are enlarged when compared with the female. Females are deeper-bodied and tend to have reddish pelvic, anal, and adipose fins. If not fully red, they have a definite red tint to their fins and even to the mid-body, which is also fuller than the males. This reddish hue in the females sometimes causes them to be confused with other tetra species.</p><h2>Breeding the Black Phantom Tetra </h2><p>Set up a breeding tank with abundant floating plants and dim lighting. Setting it up without a substrate will make the tank easier to keep clean while raising the fry. Prior to spawning, condition the mating pair with small live foods, such as mosquito larvae. Once placed in the breeding tank, keep feeding to a minimum to preserve cleanliness.</p><p>Trigger spawning by lowering the pH to 5.5 and dropping the hardness of the water to 4 dGH. Peat filtration is the best method to achieve the necessary water parameters. Males will engage in elaborate courtship fin displays that end with the female release and scattering of up to 300 eggs.</p><p>Once the eggs have been laid, remove the breeding pair from the tank. Fry are very sensitive to light, so cover three sides of the tank with cardboard. Perfect water quality is essential to prevent fungal growth on the eggs of this species. Feed every few hours with very small commercially prepared fry food or freshly hatched brine shrimp. After 10 days, feed finely crushed flake foods. Perform water changes at least once a week.</p>",889
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/black-neon-tetra-1378291,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Black Neon Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Black Neon Tetra Fish Species Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, Origin, and Helpful Information for Hobbyists</h2><p>The black neon tetra is an energetic little beauty with a pleasant personality. Put this fish among contrasting plants and a dark background and you will have a vibrant and beautiful aquarium. The black neon tetra has been successfully bred in captivity, and most black neons available for sale for the aquarium trade are captive-bred. An albino variant is sometimes also available.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black tetra, neon tetra, black neon</p><p>Scientific Name: Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi</p><p>Adult Size: 1.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The black neon tetra is native to the Paraguay basin of southern Brazil. In the wild, these fish prefer small tributaries, creeks, areas of flooded forest, and sandbanks. Their natural habitat is usually very acidic, and the water is stained brown from the tannins released by decaying organic material. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Sporting an iridescence of white, greenish, and black, the black neon makes an excellent contrast fish. They stand apart from the similarly sized tetras, such as the red-splashed rummy nose or neon tetra, and they are also a bit taller in the body. They can readily be identified as they have an enamel-white to greenish neon stripe contrasted with a rich velvety black color below.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>At an adult size of little more than 1 inch, black neons are suitable for small aquariums. They are a schooling fish and should always be kept in groups of a half dozen or more. They also make a nice addition to a larger community aquarium, as they are peaceful and easy to care for.</p><p>Neon tetras do well in a community tank, as long as tankmates are not large or aggressive. They get along well with all sorts of other peaceful fish, such as rasboras, danios, gouramis, and other small tetras as well as the corys and other small catfish. Avoid larger fish, as they will eat these tiny tetras at the first opportunity. The rule of thumb is, if the mouth of the fish opens large enough to swallow the neon, they will do it sooner or later.</p><h2>Black Neon Tetra Habitat and Care </h2><p>Like other tetras, black neons prefer soft acidic water; however, they are quite adaptable and are more tolerant of hard neutral water than other tetra species. Peat filtering is recommended for bringing out the best coloration, and peat is essential if you're attempting to breed them.</p><p>The ideal environment for the black neon tetra includes subdued lighting, live plants, open space for swimming, a dark substrate, and a healthy water current in the mid to upper region of the aquarium, where they prefer to swim. For the substrate, use river sand with some driftwood and twisted roots. Add some dried leaves to the tank, which will stain the water a light brown. Replace the leaves every few weeks. Use dim lighting to develop the tetra's coloring for the best display effect.</p><p>Black neon tetras are not exceptionally difficult to care for, provided their water is kept clean. At least 25 to 50 percent of the tank water should be replaced every other week, especially if the tank is densely stocked. Because they are very active swimmers, it is also advisable to keep them in a tank at least 20 inches in length and ideally holding 20 gallons or more. The tank should be securely covered, as these fish are skilled jumpers and will likely demonstrate this if given the opportunity.</p><h2>Black Neon Tetra Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Its natural diet consists of small invertebrates and plants and often includes crustacea, filamentous algae, and fallen fruits. Black neons are not demanding and will eat almost anything offered to them; however, they should be fed a varied diet for optimum health and color. Flake, frozen, and freeze-dried foods are all suitable, as are small live worms and brine shrimp.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Sexual differences are not obvious in black neon tetras. Generally, the female has a larger, more rounded belly than the male. A female's lower abdomen becomes filled with eggs when it is sexually mature.</p><h2>Breeding the Black Neon Tetra  </h2><p>These fish are egg layers and freely spawn in schools or in pairs. For best results when breeding, select breeding pairs from healthy adults that are approximately one year old. Younger fish may spawn, but results are better with fully mature fish.</p><p>Condition the breeding pair (or breeding group) prior to spawning with live foods such as brine shrimp and mosquito larvae. Choose males that are the most colorful. A breeding group should include only one or two males with several females.</p><p>Keep breeders in a separate tank to produce the best number of fry. A 10-gallon spawning tank is adequate. Use a dark substrate in the breeding tank. Lighting must be very dim; if the room is very bright, place cardboard on the sides of the tank to subdue the light.</p><p>Keep the spawning tank at 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 C) while conditioning the breeders. After a few days, slowly elevate the temperature to about 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 C). Maintain very soft acidic water (4 dGH or less).</p><p>Filter the water through aquarium-safe peat to encourage these fish to spawn. Fine-textured, live plants can be provided as a spawning medium, and floating plants will help to keep the tank dim. A layer of mesh can serve too, but make sure it is wide enough to let eggs pass through but small enough to keep the parents out. </p><p>Spawning generally occurs early in the day. The female will scatter several hundred sticky eggs onto the plants and/or substrate. After spawning, remove the breeders, or else the eggs and fry will almost certainly be eaten.</p><p>The eggs will hatch in approximately 22 to 26 hours, and the fry will appear three to four days later.

Its thick, verticle black and yellow stripes help individuals blend into the school in wide-open water much like zebra camouflage together on the open plains. They require a very large aquarium as the fish quickly grow to over a foot in length and are avid jumpers given any opportunity. As yet, the status of the species has not been evaluated by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature.) Although this species does not breed in captivity, it's wild range is large; fish in this genus are considered likely not at risk of overfishing for the aquarium trade.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Black banded leporinus, many banded leporinus, banded leporinus, striped leporinus, eight-banded leporinus</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 12 inches (30 cm)</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Native to the Amazon River basin in South America, this fish was also accidentally introduced into the states of Florida and Hawaii, probably by the illegal release of specimens that had grown too large for home aquariums. Although a few members of this family are regularly seen for sale in the aquarium market, there is still little scientific information available about the various species. are small members of the family. The are predominately herbivorous omnivores that inhabit swiftly moving rivers.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The name ""leporinus"" is of French origin, meaning ""little hare."" Close examination of the fish will explain the name, as they have two prominent front teeth much like a hare or rabbit. Fish species that develop crushing front teeth are usually snail eaters.</p><p>All leporinus have only five black bands as juveniles. As they grow, only one band will split in two every year, with the lighter mustard or golden yellow color in between. By counting these bands, you can age the specimen. Not all fish in the genus Leporinus carry these distinctive yellow and black stripes, but only the striped varieties, and are offered for sale in the aquarium trade.</p><p>Closely resembling each other, the primary difference between these two species is the shape of the caudal (tail) fin and the number of stripes. has a rounded caudal fin and has nine stripes. s has pointed caudal fins and displays ten vertical stripes. Some specimens (possibly the males) of will display a dusty red color on their throat, which is specific only to this species. Fins on all Leporinus are transparent or dusky with a hint of black.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Tolerant of other large fish in a community tank, lives in large schools; fish are known to quarrel among themselves from time to time. This is particularly true when they are kept in smaller groups rather than larger schools. Smaller fish in a community tank are easy prey for the black banded leporinus, so only select other large and rugged fish as tankmates.</p><p>Non-aggressive cichlids species make good co-inhabitants. Other possible tankmates for this fish would be similarly sized characins, Loricariids, Doradids, and the Knifefish. Keep leporinus with larger or same-sized, semi-aggressive fish as it is also notorious for nipping at fins. Do not keep it with slower-moving, long-finned species such as angelfish.</p><h2>Black Banded Leporinus Habitat and Care </h2><p>In nature, black banded leporinus live in rocky river beds and are accustomed to strong currents. To create the appropriate constant flow, the use of a powerhead is recommended. Sand or fine gravel can be used as a bottom substrate. </p><p>Like other , all leporinus position themselves head-down in rocky clefts and fissures; provided similar furnishings in their aquarium. In strong current environments, this habitual positioning may allow for better grazing opportunities or better camouflage among river plants, but the reason for the behavior has not been identified.</p><p>The black banded leporinus is also capable of jumping to great heights. Care should be taken to use a tight, locking cover to prevent the fish from jumping out of the tank with force. All live plants will be eaten with zeal, so use plastic plants or keep to the sturdier live plants such as java fern. The water should be kept soft and acidic. Keep in mind that when fully grown, this fish reaches nearly a foot in length, which means it requires a large aquarium of 70 gallons or larger.</p><h2>Black Banded Leporinus Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Their preferred diet consists of mostly plant material, such as leaves and algae. Chickweed, lettuce, watercress, and even cooked peas are good food sources. Vegetable flakes are also suitable if the fish will accept them. These fish may become territorial when feeding and may harass others in the school.</p><p>Some small larvae, small worms, and even fruits are also eaten in nature. These may be used as an augment to their regular vegetarian diet. Besides biting into wild fruits, the sharp, rabbit-like front teeth of the species make it able to crack the shells of snails. Do not house these fish with tank cleaning invertebrates, but do offer pond snails as a good source of nutritional live food.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>No sexual differences are discernible until they are mature adults. Females will grow large and have rounder abdomens. Males may be the individuals who develop a red throat, but this is not known.</p><h2>Breeding the Black Banded Leporinus </h2><p>Rumors circulate that this fish has been successfully bred in captivity, but there is very little, if any, documentation of such reports. It is known that the black banded leporinus is an egg layer.</p>",897

A shy angelfish that should be provided lots of places to hide, and best kept in a well-established aquarium with ample live rock growth to graze on.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black and White Bandit Angelfish, Bandit Angelfish, Black and White Banded Angelfish, Black Banded Angelfish</p><p>Adult Size: 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 2 to 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Minimum Tank Size</p><p>Diet</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This beautiful angelfish originates around the Hawaiian and Johnston Islands in the Pacific. Usually found on or near the rocky ledges of coral reefs or in caves, it is most comfortable in fast-moving water. In general, they live at depths between 12 and 50 meters, but they are capable of diving as deep as 500 feet.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Black and White Bandit is a spectacular, rare, and very distinctive angelfish. When seeing this species in person, the white areas of the body have a somewhat reflective pearlescent appearance, which truly makes it an eye-catching aquarium fish. Its body is white with a broad black bar; a white band runs across the upper side all the way from the eye to the back of the dorsal fin. A wide white-bordered black band runs along the anal and caudal fins.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The Black and White Bandit is generally easy going with other species, but can be quite aggressive with other angelfish and with other fish of about its size. It doesn't do well in a reef tank because of its habit of nipping at live coral. Thus, good tankmates include smaller, peaceful species; when adding new tankmates to join your angelfish, introduce the smallest and most docile first and allow time to see how your particular angelfish handles the stress of sharing space. If your tank is relatively small, consider keeping a Black and White Bandit as your only fish.</p><h2>Black and White Bandit Angelfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Provide your Black and White Bandit Angelfish with a large tank. Between 180-200 gallons is sufficient, but the larger the tank your happier your fish will be. Like all angelfish, the Black and White Bandit needs top notch water quality and a fast flowing current.</p><p>Remember that these fish are native to the reefs off the coast of the Hawaiian Islands, and try to replicate that environment to the best of your ability. Provide corals and plenty of live rocks to keep your fish comfortable and happy. You can even consider creating a live rock wall where your Bandit Angelfish can graze.</p><p>It is best to avoid using a net on this fish due to the rough texture of its scales. The fish will get stuck in the net material, and once snagged the only way to separate the fish from the net is to pull it off, which is much like peeling velcro apart.</p><h2>Decompression Sickness in Black and White Bandit Angelfish </h2><p>Due to inhabiting deep ocean waters, when this fish is collected it may encounter decompression sickness. Some fish collectors use a procedure called ""needling"", which is a process of piercing a small hole in the fish's air bladder with a syringe needle to release the trapped nitrogen gas. Unless a person is well experienced in this procedure, it can lead to complications of internal infections.</p><p>Since the Black and White Bandit Angelfish is normally only found at a depth below 50', proper decompression (bringing the fish up from depth at intervals) to avoid the ""bends"", decompressing can take over 4 hours. Many collectors prefer to save the time and just needle the fish on the way up to the surface. While needles can be a great time saver for the collector, the risk of the fish developing an internal infection from a dirty needle (the ocean is teeming with some very nasty bacteria) can be quite high.</p><p>The takeaway here is to make sure that you inspect this fish very carefully before purchasing it. Also make sure that the person you are buying this fish from can show you that the fish is, indeed, eating and, for that matter, exactly what it is eating.</p><p>If you buy these fish be sure to check it out thoroughly. It should be flying level, not struggling at a vertical position, and its abdomen should is not puffed out. These are usually signs of a possible internal bladder infection or residual effects of decompression sickness.</p><h2>Black and White Bandit Angelfish Diet </h2><p>Relying on sponges as its sole source of food in the wild, this fish can easily starve in captivity. If you are interested in keeping one, it wise to wait for a larger juvenile or sub-adult specimen. In most cases, these specimens will adapt to tank fed foods more readily than very small juveniles or large adults (some breeders will have already helped their fish to adapt). Provide plenty of frozen preparations especially for angels that contains sponge as the main ingredient, such as Ocean Nutrition and San Francisco Bay Brand frozen formulas.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Male and female angelfish look so similar to one another that even experts find it hard to tell them apart. In some cases it's possible to sex an angelfish based on the size of the tube located between its ventral and anal fins, but this is not a very reliable method. For most people, the only way to determine if a fish is a male or female is to wait for it to spawn which is extraordinarily rare among Black and White Bandit Angelfish kept in captivity.</p><h2>Breeding the Black and White Bandit Angelfish </h2><p>There are no accounts of hobby aquarists breeding Black and White Bandit Angelfish. Even professional fish breeders find this species extraordinarily difficult to breed; the vast majority of Black and White Bandit Angelfish in captivity are captured in the wild. This, in part, explains their very high cost: a single Black and White Angelfish can cost $800-$1000.</p>",1000

The bird wrasse is a great fish for a beginner, as long as it is provided with a large enough tank. In the wild, the male bird wrasse spends its time during the day hunting for food along the reef and in sand channels. At night, it will find a secure crevice in the rocks and hide until it turns light again. In an aquarium, this fish is constantly on the move. Give it plenty of room and make sure that there are no gaps in the aquarium cover as this bird might try to ""fly out"" if given the opportunity. They are very hardy and disease resistant. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Bird fish, green bird wrasse, black or brown bird wrasse, birdnose wrasse, Indian Ocean bird wrasse</p><p>Adult Size: 11 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Unknown</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This species is found in the Indo-Pacific oceans from India to Japan to Hawaii. It is often confused with another bird wrasse species, the green birdmouth wrasse or Red Sea bird wrasse, , which is more predominant in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. </p><p>Bird wrasses inhabit dense coral areas of lagoons and seaward reefs at depths of 6 to 98 feet. They use their bird beak-like snouts to feed on small bottom-dwelling crustaceans found between coral branches, rock, and sand, as well as small fish, brittle stars, and mollusks. Although their mouths are small, they will grab their prey and then dash it on the substrate, breaking it up into bite-size pieces.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Named for their distinctive bird-like beaked snouts, and sexed by their display of colors, bird wrasses are easy to identify. As juveniles, each species has their own unique transitional juvenile to adult colors and markings. males are typically medium to dark green or greenish-blue in color. Females are creamy white colored in front and dark brown to nearly black in back. You can tell them apart from since those males are much bluer in color. Females from front to back are white to yellow on the bottom and greenish-blue on top. Both female species have bottom half white and top half peachy colored snouts.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Bird wrasses are a semi-aggressive fish that have a tendency to eat smaller fish and almost any crustacean, shrimp, crab, snail, or clam. Bird wrasse can easily outcompete slower-moving species (and even some pretty fast-moving ones) at mealtimes. Some will steal food out of the mouths of other tankmates. Do not mix with other elongated fish. This fish can grab that fish in its beak-like mouth and do serious harm.</p><p>This fish is considered a great addition to a predatory reef tank. The bird wrasse is semi-aggressive toward its food but basically passive toward fish that they do not view as lunch.</p><p>Only one bird wrasse male should be kept in an aquarium. A male-female pair should be added to the aquarium at the same time, introducing the female first.</p><h2>Bird Wrasse Habitat and Care </h2><p>Because of its size and constant roaming nature, the minimum aquarium size suggested for this fish is at least 125 gallons.</p><p>At times, large males can be very shy and will not come out to eat for a few days. Make sure you provide hiding places in the form of rockwork and plants. Rockwork or live rock with plenty of hiding places is important, especially when first introduced. This fish will need well-oxygenated water that is brisk and aerated due to their high energy.</p><p>They typically sleep under rock shelves, under corals, on the sand surface, or in a crevice. Generally, they do not bury themselves like other wrasses but may hide in the sand if frightened. Having 3 or 4 inches of sand can be a good idea just in case they decide they need to burrow.</p><p>The bird wrasse is considered easy to care for. It is better to choose smaller individuals that will adapt better to captivity. When choosing your bird wrasse, keep in mind they are very smart and will have done everything they can to escape capture in the wild. Damaged fins or missing scales are easily healed, but a specimen with damage to the mouth or eyes can easily die from those injuries within a short period of time, so, avoid those specimens.</p><h2>Bird Wrasse Diet </h2><p>Although this fish's bird-like beak mouth is small, it is adept at grasping prey in its strong jaws. Once captured, it bashes the prey item against the substrate until it breaks into bite-sized pieces.</p><p>A bird wrasse will eat nasty fire and other nuisance bristle worms, but beneficial and decorative type worms, small crustaceans, snails and such as well. Feed a hardy diet of vitamin-enriched frozen brine and mysid shrimp preparations, small bits of fresh or frozen meaty seafood, and frozen silversides. It is recommended to feed this fish three times a day.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>In the wild, a single male congregates with a large harem of females. Nature's way of propagating the species is that a single female will change into a male, separate from the group, and once fully transformed, starts a harem of its own. For a period of time during this female-to-male transformation, the fish possesses colors of both sexes but eventually turns into an all green adult male.</p><h2>Breeding of the Bird Wrasse  </h2><p>The breeding of the bird wrasse is generally unknown in captivity. It is suggested that a large tank, such as a 300-gallon-plus tank may be needed for these fish to feel comfortable enough to spawn in captivity. </p>",907

These Southeast Asian fish are not true sharks, but their shark-like appearance and size make them quite an intriguing pet. Due to their peaceful nature, juvenile bala sharks do well in a community aquarium. As they mature, however, they will eventually outgrow most tanks, and they will continue to grow for several years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: bala shark, hangus, Malaysian shark, silver bala, silver shark, tricolor shark, tri-color shark minnow</p><p>Adult Size: 13 inches (35 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution  </h2><p>Bala sharks originate from Southeast Asia in medium to large-sized rivers, as well as lakes. At one time they were found in Thailand, Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malayan peninsula. However, they have become rare in many areas that they originally inhabited and are believed to be completely extinct in some regions.</p><p>The cause of this drastic reduction of bala sharks in their native lands is still under debate. Some believe they were overfished for the aquarium industry. Others think damming of the rivers is to blame, while still others believe pollution is the root cause. All of these quite likely factored in the demise of this fish that at one time was quite prolific in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Regardless of the reasons, there is no question that the bala shark is rarely found in its original native habitats. In fact, since 1996 it has been on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Currently, this species is commercially farm bred in the Far East, using hormones to promote spawning. Almost all specimens sold in the aquarium trade have been captive-bred.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>This species is known by a number of names, all of which have something in common: the word ""shark."" Even though the bala shark is not a shark at all, it has a large triangular-shaped dorsal fin and a torpedo-shaped body, giving it a distinctly shark-like appearance, but that's where the similarity ends.</p><p>A member of the Cyprinid family, has a shiny metallic silver body with well-defined scales, large eyes, and a deeply forked yellow-tinged tail. The dorsal, caudal, pelvic, and anal fins are all edged in deep black. This tri-color scheme of silver, yellow, and black gives rise to another of its common names, the tri-color shark.</p><p>Perhaps the most important feature of this fish is its adult size. Usually sold as young juveniles in pet shops, they are only a mere three to four inches, giving potential owners the impression that they are suitable for most tanks. What isn't readily apparent is the fact that this fish can grow to a foot or more in size, making it suitable for only very large aquariums. This is particularly important because bala sharks are schooling fish that must be kept with others of their own kind.</p><p>Be aware that many pet shops will not take large fish back, so take that into consideration before bringing one home. Ask the shop if it makes trade-in arrangements. If all else fails, check out public locations, such as medical offices or other businesses that have large aquariums that could use large fish. The one option that should be used is to drop a bala shark, or any other nonindigenous fish, into local waterways. Unwanted fish should be euthanized before opting to release them outdoors.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Juvenile bala sharks can be kept with a wide variety of fish due to their generally peaceful nature. As they grow larger, though, they will sometimes eat small fish, particularly sleek fish, such as the neon tetra. Balas should not be housed with invertebrates, such as snails or shrimp, as these are always part of their diet in the wild. They also tend to scare the shy and slow-moving fish, due to their constant, vigorous activity in the tank.</p><p>Balas are most content in schools, preferably of four or more; when kept alone, they tend to be both timid and skittish. If only two or three balas are in the tank, a dominant fish may emerge and bully the others. If the tank is large enough though, adult bala sharks can be housed with other medium- to large-sized robust fish.</p><h2>Bala Shark Habitat and Care  </h2><p>As previously mentioned, the key factor in the bala's environment is tank size. An aquarium of 125 gallons is needed to keep a school of adult bala sharks, and since they are active swimmers, a longer tank is recommended. These are active fish that startle easily.</p><p>In warm climates, ponds are also an option for this species, but they should only be kept outdoors in locations where it is warm year-round. They are sensitive to water conditions, particularly low water temperatures, and are susceptible to white spot disease when temperatures drop too low.</p><p>The tank should be fitted with a tight cover, as this species jumps when startled. Decorate with large robust plants around the periphery of the tank, but leave plenty of open swimming space in the center of the tank. Floating plants are also suitable to deter fish from jumping out. Provide smooth rocks and driftwood to round out the décor. Filtration should be robust to ensure good water movement and high oxygen levels throughout the water column.</p><h2>Bala Shark Diet and Feeding </h2><p>This species is an omnivore that is not fussy about what it eats. Bala sharks accept flake foods, pellets, freeze-dried and frozen foods. They also voraciously accept live foods, including , bloodworms, brine shrimp, mosquito larvae, and tubifex worms. Vegetables should be included in their diet as well; they readily consume fresh veggies such as spinach and peas, as well as fresh fruits.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>Most of the time, there are no obvious external differences between the sexes. However, during the spawning season, the female develops a rounder underbelly than the male.</p><h2>Breeding the Bala Shark </h2><p>Bala sharks have not been successfully bred in home aquaria, although occasional undocumented reports do surface. The likely issue is tank size, along with the lack of information regarding the required conditions for breeding. Interestingly though, this species is bred commercially. However, the commercial breeders in Asia employ the use of hormones to induce spawning, so the natural spawning conditions are still largely unidentified.</p>",1034

Provided no tankmates try to snack on the Amano shrimp, they are a good community tank addition for tanks of various temperatures.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Amano Shrimp, Japonica Amano Shrimp, Japanese Swamp Shrimp</p><p>Scientific Name: (previously known as )</p><p>Adult Size: 2 inches</p><p>Live Expectancy: 2 to 3 years</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>As their alternative names suggest, the Amano shrimp is native to Japan. Originally dwelling in freshwater swamps, these crustaceans have been recently brought into the aquarium hobby. As with many other shrimp species, the Amano shrimp survives in the wild by grazing on algae and detritus left by other aquatic animals.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Amano shrimp is mostly translucent and either brown or tan in color. They may have a brown or tan stripe running along the length of their dorsal ridge with matching darker stripes or bands along the sides of their body. The stripe across their back may have a solid white or lighter color line in the middle. Their side bars may be broken up, look more like dots, or run only partway the length of the shrimp. It should only be kept with nonaggressive species of fish such as livebearers and tetras, danios or other small community fish species.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A peaceful, community player, the Amano shrimp's biggest concern is being snacked upon by its tankmates. Small, crunchy shrimp should not be on the diet of any of the fish kept with this species. Even if you try to satiate the appetites of aggressive carnivores, they will likely still snack upon defenseless shrimp.</p><p>Given its temperature range tolerance, the Amano shrimp does well in both heated and non-heated aquariums. As with most shrimp species, they like to have lots of places to hide from their tankmates. Keep this in mind if you are housing them with any other species that like to have their own space, such as a Plecostomus.</p><h2>Amano Shrimp Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Amano shrimp is an excellent addition to a well-established aquarium with a shrimp-friendly substrate. Although you do not need to use a shrimp-specific substrate, large rocks or lots of bulky décor items are harder for a shrimp to navigate in comparison to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or live plant substrate.</p><p>Live plants are a great addition to a shrimp aquarium and you will often see them nibbling on dead areas. There is a common misconception that shrimp destroy live plants, but they only eat the dead materials. If your plants fail to thrive, do not blame your shrimp.</p><p>Just because the Amano shrimp likes to clean your tank for a living does not mean your maintenance routine should be altered! Continue to keep a close eye on your water chemistry and stick to your usual maintenance practices. Just like fish, shrimp do not tolerate poor water quality. Depending on how many shrimp you have in your tank, expect to continue cleaning some of the algae yourself!</p><h2>Amano Shrimp Diet and Feeding </h2><p>Many hobbyists make the incorrect assumption that Amano shrimp can subsist on only the algae in the aquarium. However, the Amano shrimp does best when fed a mixed diet of plant and animal-based proteins. If kept in a tank with other fish species, just make sure there are enough leftovers for the shrimp to have a thorough meal.</p><p>You do not have to feed a shrimp-specific diet. Depending upon the other species in your tank, your shrimp will do well on a mix of omnivore, herbivore and/or carnivore fish diets being fed to other tankmates.</p><h2>Gender Differences </h2><p>There are subtle physical characteristics that can differentiate male and female Amano shrimp. Provided they are the same age and fed the same diet, female Amano shrimp will be larger than males. Females also have a spot on their underside, known as a saddle, for storing eggs. This may not be evident, however, if your female is not in the process of spawning.</p><h2>Breeding the Amano Shrimp </h2><p>It has been difficult for hobbyists to breed the Amano shrimp in captivity. Like other shrimp species, the female will release a breeding hormone to attract the males to breed. You may note a change in your shrimps' behavior as they try to find the mature female.</p><p>In the wild, the fertilized eggs will drift along the current into brackish water, and out to the open sea. Once fully grown, the shrimp will return to freshwater. This is thought to be the main issue with successfully breeding this shrimp in captivity.</p>",764

When first introduced they can be a bit touchy and should be quarantined for a few weeks to be sure they are eating well and adjusted to your reef keeping habits before being introduced into your main display tank. Once settled into your system, they are hardy, active, and very attractive fish.</p><p>Achilles Tang fish are highly susceptible to contracting ich and can have problems with HLLE. It can be aggressive towards other surgeonfishes, especially those of its own kind. Large adult specimens in particular fight terribly if not given plenty of space to keep them apart. Unless you're able to provide a very large system with more than ample room to swim around and plenty of places to hide, this fish is best kept singly. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Achilles surgeonfish, achilles tangred spot surgeonfish, redtail surgeonfish</p><p>Adult Size: 9.4 inches (24 cm)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2> Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Achilles Tangs are found in the waters of the Western Pacific near the islands of Oceania as well as the Pitcairn and Hawaiian Islands. They also inhabit reefs surrounding the Wake, Marcus, and Mariana islands, and have been found in the Eastern Central Pacific near Baja California and Mexico. They generally swim among the coral reefs, in the area called the surge zone; this is the area where waves break over the reefs, creating currents and oxygenating the water. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Achilles Tang is a dark brown or purplish fish with bright areas of orange and white around its fins and gill covers. It also sports a bright orange teardrop-shaped mark near the caudal fin (this mark starts out as a streak in young Achilles Tang, but changes shape over time). </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The Achilles Tang can be quite aggressive toward others of their species and toward other surgeonfish. It's, therefore, best to keep only one in a tank. They can, however, interact peacefully with other small, peaceful fish. The trick, however, is to provide an appropriate environment for the Tang with fast-moving water while also providing a healthy setting for the smaller fish that more typically prefer only a moderate current. Because Achilles Tangs are so delicate, it's usually best to put their needs first.</p><h2>Achilles Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Achilles Tang requires lots of room to swim around, and plenty of places to hide. A constant grazer, this fish is best kept in a well-established aquarium with a hardy growth of marine algae to graze on at its leisure. In the wild, the Achilles Tang greatly prefers the highly oxygenated waters of the surge zones in and around the reef with plenty of holes and caves to retreat to when it feels threatened.</p><h2>Achilles Tang Diet </h2><p>The Achilles Tang is an herbivore and can be very picky about its food. It prefers micro and macroalgae but can be fed frozen and dried marine algae and spirulina. They may also be willing to eat vegetables such as broccoli, zucchini, and dried seaweed. They should be fed three times a day.  </p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>There is no obvious visual difference between the male and female Achilles Tang.</p><h2>Breeding the Achilles Tang </h2><p>It is almost impossible to breed the Achilles Tang in a private aquarium. In the wild, it spawns in groups; the female ejects a ""cloud"" of eggs, and the male swims through the cloud fertilizing the eggs. Later, the fertile eggs float to the surface of the water. After they are born, the larvae can feed on surface plankton. Finally, the larvae develop into juveniles that make their way to the reef where they live out the remainder of their lives.</p><h2>Notes About the Achilles Tang </h2><p>The Achilles Tang is one of the most challenging fish available to aquarium keepers.
