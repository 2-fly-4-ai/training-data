If you cannot find one or you want to save some money, learn how to do it yourself. Grooming includes bathing, drying, nail trimming, coat brushing, ear cleaning, and teeth brushing.</p><h2>How Often Should You Bathe Your Ferret? </h2><p>Bathing ferrets is a somewhat controversial topic. People who are more sensitive to the natural musky scent of a ferret may be tempted or advised to bathe their ferret often, but this often backfires. The ferret's scent is partially due to the natural oils from the ferret's skin. A bath may temporarily reduce the musky scent, but because the bath strips the skin and fur of these oils, the bath actually stimulates an increase in the production of skin oils. The musky scent may actually become stronger for a couple of days after the bath. Keep the cage and litter clean and it will help keep your ferret smelling fresh.</p><p>Bathing tends to dry out the skin and coat, at most bathe once a month. Unless your ferret has gotten into something that needs to be washed off, a bath every two to three months is probably plenty.</p><h2>The Bath </h2><p>You will need a gentle shampoo for your ferret. Your best bet is a shampoo made specifically for ferrets; there are several brands available. If you cannot find a ferret shampoo, use one formulated for kittens or even tearless baby shampoo.</p><p>Some ferrets take quite naturally to water while others are very reluctant to take a bath. The first few experiences with bath time will set the tone of baths in the future, so if your ferret is afraid of water, go slow and be patient. If your ferret is fearful of the water, try to keep it as stress-free as possible. If you are stressed your ferret will pick up on this. Keep your tone upbeat, offer some favorite treats, and maybe get some fun waterproof toys. Making bath time like a special playtime.</p><p>You can bathe your ferret in a bathtub or kitchen sink or any other convenient location. Fill the tub or sink with just enough water that the ferret will be mostly submerged but still able to touch the bottom. Support your ferret well. You may want to use a rubber mat or towel on the bottom to give your ferret firm footing.</p><p>Use water that feels slightly warm to your touch, but not too hot. Lather up the body well, but make sure not to get shampoo in the eyes or ears (if you accidentally do, rinse well with fresh water). Rinse all of the shampoo out, since any left in the coat could be drying or irritating. Refill the tub with fresh water, maybe even a couple of times, to make sure the rinse is as complete as possible.</p><h2>Drying </h2><p>Towel drying is usually sufficient and ferrets usually dry out pretty quickly, but it is important to make sure they do not become chilled when still damp. Unless their cage is freshly cleaned, that is not the best place to put them while still damp as a romp through a dirty cage or litter box will undo the work of the bath.</p><p>Some owners put some clean towels in the tub and let their ferrets dry themselves off by burrowing in the towels. Some ferrets are okay with a blow dryer, but if you choose to try this keep the dryer on a low setting and keep it at least a foot from the ferret.</p><h2>Flea Treatment </h2><p>If your ferret has fleas, consult your veterinarian before using a flea shampoo. Your vet will recommend the best program of treatment for fleas for your household, including a ferret-safe flea shampoo if indicated.</p><h2>Nail Trimming </h2><p>Nail clippers meant for cats that look like small scissors with a little notch in the blade work well for ferrets. You can also use a small pair of human nail clippers. However, sometimes these pinch the nail before cutting and your ferret may find this uncomfortable.</p><p>The trick to nail clipping is to cut the sharp tip off the nail without cutting into the quick. The quick is thepart inside the nail where the blood vessel and nerve endings are located. Most ferrets have light or translucent nails, and the quick is visible as the pink part inside the nail. Make your cut a bit in front of the quick; if you get too close it may still be a bit painful.</p><p>If your pet has dark nails, you will have to guess where to cut based on the shape of the nail. The tip of the nail is usually quite narrow and may almost appear hollow when viewed from the bottom. It is safest to just clip off about 1/4 inch of the nail tip.</p><p>In case you cut into the quick, the nail will bleed and it will hurt your ferret. Make sure you have something on hand to stop the bleeding like Kwik-Stoppowder or some other commercial styptic powder product. These products sometimes sting but are highly effective. Take a pinch of powder and press it onto the tip of the affected nail after wiping away the blood. For minor bleeding, simply apply pressure to the tip of the nail. No matter the method you use, make sure the bleeding has stopped before placing the animal back in its cage or leaving the animal unattended.</p><p>If you have doubts about how to do it, it is wise to get a groomer, veterinarian, or another experienced owner to demonstrate nail clipping for you before you attempt it on your own.</p><h3>Tips</h3><h2>Brushing </h2><p>Regular brushing is a great way to keep the coat in good condition and is especially useful when ferrets are shedding to minimize the amount of hair ingested by ferrets, thuspreventing hairballs. Manyferretsare not keen on staying still long enough for brushing, so get in the habit of doing a very quick brushing frequently. Use a soft, short-bristled brush meant for cats or kittens, or try one of the newer rubber grooming tools, which are great at quickly picking up loose hair from the coat like the Kong Zoom Groom.</p><p>Even with regular brushing, it is a good idea to give a hairball preventative to your ferret regularly, especially when it is shedding. Preventatives are available in a malt-flavored gel in a tube, which ferrets often view as a treat.</p><h2>Ear Cleaning </h2><p>Ferrets do tend to have waxy ears, and keeping them clean will help prevent problems and infections. Normally, their ear wax is light brown or reddish in color. Regular cleaning will help you spot a change in the amount or the texture of ear wax which could indicate an infection or ear mites.</p><p>To clean the ears, get a mild ear cleaning solution from your vet or pet store. An ear cleaner safe for kittens should be okay for ferrets. Put a few drops in the ear, massage the ear for a bit, then let the ferret shake its head. This is great for dislodging wax, but it can be messy. Do this in an area that is easily cleaned such as the bathroom. A cotton-tipped swab moistened with the cleaner can be used to wipe out the external part of the ear.Neverpush a cotton swab into the ear canal. If your ferret is particularly squirmy, be extra cautious to avoid pushing wax down into the ear canal.</p><p>Ear mitesare quite common, and ear infections can occur as well. If your ferret has copious ear wax or discharge, dark brown or black wax, bad-smelling ears, or if your ferret is shaking his or her head, scratching at the ears, or tilting his or her head to the side, a trip to the vet is needed to rule out problems.</p><h2>Brushing Teeth </h2><p>Brushing teeth on a regular basis is a good preventative measure as dental diseases such as gingivitis can commonly present in ferrets. This will also give you a chance to spot any developing problems early. You should try to brush the teeth at least once a week. This is not the easiest part of the grooming routine, but getting in the habit can prevent dental problems down the road.</p><p>Use a toothbrush meant for cats that looks like a set of short bristles on a rubber tube that fits over your finger or even just a piece of gauze wrapped around your finger. You can use a drop of your ferrets favorite liquid/gel vitamin supplement but never use human toothpaste. Then simply wipe the teeth with the brush or gauze.</p><p>Aim for doing the outside surfaces of the teeth and gums at first, paying particular attention to the gum line. As with many other grooming procedures, your ferret may object strenuously at first. Be patient and slowly increasing the amount you do each session. Chances are your ferret will come to accept tooth brushing as a part of its routine.</p>",1504
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/keeping-pet-mantids-1239208,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Should You Keep a Praying Mantis as a Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Praying Mantis as a Pet?</h1><p>A praying mantis is a fun and relatively simple pet to care for. There are actually numerous (over 2,000 and counting) species of mantids. The term praying mantis may have originally referred to a specific species (, the European mantis), but now the term ""praying mantid"" (and ""praying mantis"") is used widely to refer to any of the large family of mantids. The ""praying"" descriptor arose from the way that mantids hold their grasping front legs, as if in prayer. Several types of mantids are available for insect hobbyists, such as the African praying mantis specieswhich are suitable for beginners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAME:Praying Mantis</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAMES:and</p><p>ADULT SIZE:The praying mantis's body ranges from 1 to 6 inches long, although most are 2 to 3 inches.</p><p>LIFESPAN:Up to 1 year maximum in captivity</p><p> </p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Praying Mantis? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>Check your local laws before deciding on a praying mantis as a pet as they may be illegal where you are. They're usually not, though, and praying mantises are actually the official state insect of Connecticut! There has been a good deal of urban legends about these curious breeds, mostly that they're federally protected and killing one carries a fine. This is patently false, and for good reason: praying mantises in the wild help gardeners and farmers with pest control!</p><p>These serious-looking insects are a curious pet choice, and many of the same rules for unusual pets apply to them.</p><h2>Praying Mantis Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Mantids come in a huge range of sizes, shapes, and colors. Some look like twigs (and use this as camouflage), some resemble crumpled dead leaves, and others have brightly colored and delicate features that make them look like blossoms. They also come from a variety of mostly tropical climates. All mantids are carnivores, feeding mainly on other insects and spiders; some of the larger mantids may even eat small amphibians and reptiles.</p><p>Since there are so many species of mantids, it's important to know what type you have. Every species is different in shape, size, behavior, life-history traits, and specific needs. Depending on the type of mantis, your insect could be docile and quiet or be more aggressive and make more noise. Some prefer to stalk their prey and others do so less aggressively. When threatened, most will strike a defensive pose. The rumors that they can hurt you by pinching are untrue.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Mantids should be housed individually; each praying mantis needs only a small tank. Generally, a tank should be at least twice as wide and three times as tall as the mantid, but not much larger than that. If the tank is too large, the mantid will have a hard time finding its prey. A 1- square foot tank is a good size for most praying mantises. The 12-inch height is important to provide space for molting. A mesh top is preferred and mesh openings on the side are helpful, if possible. </p><p>Temperature is one of the most important aspects of praying mantis husbandry and one that can vary with different species. Some species are tolerant of variations, but some have very specific needs, so check your species' requirements. The commonly kept African praying mantis should be kept at 70 to 86 F. If additional heat is necessary, use a small under-tank heating mat (as sold for reptiles and hermit crabs). For species care sheets, a helpful reference is DeShawn's Mantid Kingdom.</p><p>The required humidity also varies by praying mantis species. For example, the African mantis requires 60 percent humidity. A regular light misting of the tank will help provide humidity. The drinking water can also help provide a humidity source.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Use a substrate of 1- to 2- inches of soil, peat, peat, or soil mixed with sand, or vermiculite in the bottom of the tank for a pet praying mantis. This will help retain moisture. Provide several twigs that reach almost to the top of the tank as the mantid will need space to climb and hang from a twig for molting. Live potted plants or artificial plants can be used too, but make sure not to overcrowd the tank. Your praying mantis will need space to move about, hunt, and molt.</p><h2>What Does a Praying Mantis Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Provide a variety of feeder insects for your praying mantis. The best way to make sure nutritional needs are met is to feed a number of different kinds of prey: fruit flies and aphids for nymphs, instars and smaller mantids, and a variety of flying insects such as moths, fruit flies, and house flies along with an occasional cricket or mealworm for larger ones. Gut load the prey by feeding it a vitamin-enriched food which will be passed on to the mantis.</p><p>For drinking water, use a small, shallow water dish containing pebbles or a piece of sea sponge to prevent drowning. This water will also provide a humidity boost. Most mantids will get their water intake by drinking water droplets off vegetation provided by misting, though some may use the water dish. Be careful that the humidity does not get too high.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Food poisoning is a common reason that mantids get sick, often because of unhygienic feeder insects. Be sure to buy their food source from a reputable seller, and if yours falls ill you should change to another seller immediately. If your juvenile mantis isn't eating, it might be getting ready to molt. They often don't eat for a few days beforehand.</p><p>Another issue can happen when your mantid molts praying mantises molt up to ten times in their lifetime, as they are growing into their adult bodies. You'll know they're finished when they've fully developed their wings. Sometimes, they may lose a limb in the molting process; this can happen if their cage wasn't humid enough. It's possible that your mantid will regain that limb in the next molt unless it was their final molt. Additionally, do not handle your praying mantis during the molting stage. The praying mantis will be without an exoskeleton and is very fragile.</p><p>Mating can also put your mantid's health or really its life in danger. Female mantids often, but not always, eat the head of the male they've mated with. </p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>So long as your praying mantis has enough room to climb around its tank, that's all the exercise it needs.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Mantids groom themselves, and you can harm them by attempting to groom them.</p><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Since praying mantises molt their entire outer shell, you'll often find it at the bottom of their enclosure. Often they will eat it, as it's packed with nutrients. </p><h3>Bathing/Grooming </h3><p>There are is no need to bathe or groom your praying mantis; it does it all for itself! </p><h3>Size Information </h3><p>Praying mantises vary in size, from 1 to 6 inches long, depending on the species.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Praying Mantis as a Pet </h2><p>On the pro side, mantids are fun and easy to own as they require little maintenance, and they take up very little space. But for cons, praying mantises only live up to a year, max, and most live only four to eight weeks past their final molt into adulthood. </p><h2>Purchasing Your Praying Mantis </h2><p>Praying mantises can be found in the wild. Look closely since they are the masters of disguise. If you plan on adopting a praying mantis from your yard, be sure you are fully prepared to take care of it, establish its environment, and feed it the correct diet. If not, it's best to release it after taking a close look at it.</p><p>You can also purchase them from some pet stores or online breeders; both can give you exact instructions on the care and feeding of your new pet.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>The breeder you purchase from should be able to tell you about their breeding process, and give you instructions on how to care for your mantid. </p><h2>Similar Insects to the Praying Mantis </h2> <p>Otherwise, check out otherexotic animalsthat can be your new pet!</p><p>Yes! You just need to find them the right-sized enclosure and provide them with the correct diet. (You'll need to feel comfortable feeding them live worms!)</p><p>Not really. They are smallish insects, and while you can hold them or take them out of their enclosures they will never be the same kind of pet as a cat or dog.</p><p>When it has wings! Your mantid will molt a number of times on its way to adulthood. Once it has wings, it's finished its final molt.</p>",1412
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-care-for-a-harlequin-rabbit-5496310,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Harlequin Rabbit</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Harlequin Rabbit</h1><p>Harlequin rabbits are considered a separate breed by most but only a specific color pattern by some. Regardless of how you classify them, harlequin rabbits are known for their unique, colorful coats and can come in a variety of sizes. Knowing what kind of care they require can help keep your rabbit happy and live a long life.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Harlequin rabbit, Japanese harlequin rabbit, Magpie harlequin rabbit</p> <p>Adult Size: 6.5-9.5 lbs.</p><p>Lifespan: About 5-8 years but can live up to 12 years</p><h2>Harlequin Rabbit Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>A harlequin rabbit can make a great pet for the right person. They are easygoing animals and are known to be playful and smart. Rabbits are not aggressive creatures and are more likely to run away than to try and nip if they are scared or threatened. They are most active at dawn and dusk but can often be found lounging around and napping both during the day and evening when they're not busy playing.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Harlequin rabbits can vary in size. They range anywhere from 6.5-9.5 lbs with the females typically being a little larger than the males. They are considered a small- to medium-sized rabbit breed.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Rabbits need a lot of space to run and play, but when they aren't hopping around, they also need a secure place to sleep. If your harlequin rabbit is an indoor rabbit, a minimum cage size of 3 feet by 3 feet should be provided. Store-bought cages are available, but many people create their own rabbit enclosures using exercise pens, dog crates, and other items. Outdoor rabbit hutches can also be bought or made but should be especially secure to prevent your rabbit from escaping or being injured or killed by a predator.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>If you choose to use a substrate in your rabbit's house, avoid cedar and pine shavings. These can be aromatic and contain oils that can cause respiratory and skin issues. Opt for aspen or recycled paper materials instead if you want to provide your rabbit with some bedding to sleep in. Litter boxes can also contain this substrate or you can use hay or unscented, dust-free cat litter.</p><h2>What Do Harlequin Rabbits Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Like other rabbits, harlequins eat a variety of vegetables and hay. Depending on the size of your rabbit, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of rabbit pellets without seeds or colored pieces can be provided, but the majority of their meal should be composed of grass hay and dark, leafy greens. Occasional treats of sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green can also be given. Remember, if your rabbit's diet is not appropriate, it is more likely to develop ileus.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Harlequin rabbits can, unfortunately, develop a variety of health problems.</p><p>All of these health problems and many others will require the help of a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care. </p><h2>Training Your Harlequin Rabbit </h2><p>Harlequin rabbits are very smart and can be trained to do simple tricks, come when called, use a litter box, and more. Some people even teach them to walk on a harness and leash and fetch toys.</p><h3>Leash Training </h3><p>If you want to train your rabbit to walk on a leash, be sure to attach it to a harness that is designed for a rabbit. Verbal coaxing, as well as treats, can help encourage your rabbit to walk toward you while it gets used to being attached to a leash.</p><h3>Potty Training </h3><p>With a little patience and consistency, you can train your rabbit to use a litter box. This will make you more likely to let your rabbit roam around in a rabbit-proofed environment since you won't have to worry about cleaning up any accidents.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Exercise is vital to your rabbit's mental and physical health. Your rabbit needs space to run and play so that it can forage for food, be mentally stimulated, find things to chew on, maintain muscle mass, and keep its digestive tract moving. Gastrointestinal motility can decrease or stop due to stress as well as a lack of physical mobility.  </p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Harlequin rabbits have short hair but that doesn't mean they don't have grooming needs. Nail trims, ear cleanings, baths, and perhaps even tooth trims may be necessary depending on your specific rabbit and their lifestyle.</p><h3>Shedding </h3><p>Rabbits shed on a regular basis but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, more fur will be lost by your rabbit than normal.</p><h3>Brushing </h3><p>While harlequin rabbits don't have very long hair, you may still need to occasionally brush them. Brushing can help decrease the amount of fur you find around the house and on your clothes.</p><h3>Baths </h3><p>Rabbits are typically very clean animals so bathing them may not be necessary, but if they get messy, a quick bath may be warranted. Use dish soap and lukewarm water while carefully cleaning your rabbit and towel dry them thoroughly. </p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Caring for a harlequin rabbit may cost more than you expect. Due to daily fresh vegetables, hay, and pellets, expect to spend around $50 a month just for food and another $10-$20 on toys and bedding. Additionally, you'll want to budget for routine and emergency vet visits for when your rabbit requires medical attention. </p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Harlequin Rabbit as a Pet </h2><p>Rabbits require a lot more space and attention than many people think, but they are also very personable pets. They require fresh vegetables to eat each day but can be cuddly and live to be 12 years of age.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Harlequin Rabbit </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother types of rabbits that can be your new pet!</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Harlequin Rabbit </h2><p>Harlequin rabbits are not a common breed so they aren't usually found in pet stores. You will most likely need to purchase your harlequin rabbit from a breeder online or at a rabbit show, but you may occasionally find one with a rescue group. If you are looking to rescue a harlequin rabbit, you can contact your local House Rabbit Society chapter to see if they have recommendations for rabbit rescues or contact local rabbit rescues directly.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>The American Rabbit Breeders Association lists upcoming shows as well as harlequin rabbit breeders on their website that have paid to list their contact information. You should expect to pay anywhere between $20 and $100, depending on the color and pattern quality. If you decide to get more than one rabbit and they are of opposite sexes, you'll want to get your female spayed to prevent unwanted litters. Alternatively, you can get two females. If you want to get two males, you'll need to get them neutered if you want to keep them from fighting with each other.</p><h2>FAQ Block </h2><p>Yes! Harlequin rabbits can make great pets for kids. Rabbits love to play and have unique personalities, so they can be a lot of fun. Young children will need help handling, feeding, and cleaning a harlequin rabbit, however.</p><p>The price of a harlequin rabbit will vary depending on the color and pattern of the fur. Show quality patterns will cost more than a pet quality pattern but they can range in price from $20-$100.</p><p>A rabbit is more work than a hamster, but they are not hard to take care of. They do need adequate space and playtime as well as fresh food daily. Rabbits are not simply caged pets.</p>",1298
5,https://www.thesprucepets.com/limping-in-pet-rabbits-4126807,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Why Your Pet Rabbit Is Limping</h1>,"<h1>Why Your Pet Rabbit Is Limping</h1><p>Rabbits have quite the back leg strength and are well-known for their hopping ability. But just like other animals, sometimes things can happen that can cause a rabbit to start limping.</p><h2>Fracture </h2><p>Your rabbit may suddenly start to limp if they have fractured (broken) its leg. This may be an obvious reason for limping in rabbits, but it is also a very serious one. Rabbits can jump off of high surfaces or out of your arms while holding them and land too hard on their legs causing a fracture. This is a common occurrence with small children who try to carry their rabbits. The rabbit may struggle and fall or jump and land incorrectly causing a fractured leg. If you suspect your rabbit has broken its leg, get it to the exotics vet as soon as possible for treatment.</p><p>Another reason a fracture could occur is from your rabbit's leg getting stuck in something such as its cage bars. Hay hoppers and inappropriately sized cage bar spacing are the usual culprits as are ramps in their cages and floor vents in your home. Make sure your rabbit's leg cannot slip into or through any of these items that are in their environment.</p><h2>Pododermatitis </h2><p>More commonly known as ""Bumblefoot,"" pododermatitis is a foot infection that can occur in rabbits. This type of problem can be very painful and cause your rabbit to limp. You will notice redness, sores, hair loss,and perhaps even scabbing or oozing on the bottoms of their feet (typically at the heel) or hocks (ankles).</p><p>Bumblefoot in rabbits can be caused by several factors. Some reasons for bumblefoot include your rabbit being overweight and putting too much pressure on their feet and hocks, which causes sores that subsequently become infected; dirty environments that cause persistent moisture on the feet and hocks; rough surfaces like metal wires that your rabbit has no relief from; your rabbit sitting in their dirty litterbox for extended amounts of time; and sedentary rabbits that sit for prolonged periods of time without much exercise. Bumblefoot can also occur if one leg is injured and the rabbit bears weight on the other good limb for a long period of time.</p><p>Bumblefoot can be treated in a variety of ways depending on the severity of it, but it usually involves antibiotics, pain medications, increases in padding, and correcting the reason for the problem.</p><h2>Tumor </h2><p>While not the reason anyone wants to hear, sometimes rabbits limp because of a tumor. Bone cancers are sometimesseen in rabbits and are very painful, which causes a rabbit to limp. If you notice any type of swelling or lump on your rabbit, do not hesitate to make an appointment with your exotics vet to find out what it may be. If it is a tumor it may need to be surgically removed. Sometimes leg amputations need to be performed to completely remove the tumor if it is cancerous.</p><h2>Abscess </h2><p>Rabbits are particularly prone to abscesses. Abscesses seem to pop up anywhere on a rabbit and can be very difficult to get rid of. They can also become large enough to cause discomfort to your rabbit and if located on their leg, cause limping.</p><p>Abscesses are pus-filled lumps that are treated by lancing them (cutting them open) and with antibiotics, pain medications, and sometimes even with surgical debridement or removal. Just like a tumor, if you notice any type of lump on your rabbit be sure to have your exotics vet examine it to determine how to treat it.</p><h2>Osteoarthritis </h2><p>Known commonly as arthritis, osteoarthritis is the inflammation of the joints and can affect rabbits just like it can affect people, our dogs, and other pets. Arthritis usually occurs in older rabbits and can cause limping.</p><p>Both front and hind legs can be affected by arthritis and it is important to remember that any joint can be bothered by it. Arthritis does not just isolate itself to elbows and knees as many people often think but rather it can be found in the carpus (wrist), hock (ankle), hip joint,and even in any of the many joints of the feet and toes.</p><p>Radiographs (X-rays) are used to diagnose arthritis in rabbits. Unfortunately, there is no way to undo arthritis but there is a way to treat the pain and inflammation that it may cause. Different medications and supplements may be prescribed or recommended by your exotics vet, but it is important to discuss any of these items with them before attempting to medicate your rabbit. Your veterinarian may recommend physical therapy, laser therapy, or even acupuncture in addition to those mentioned above.</p><p>Some long-term medications and dosages may be harmful to a rabbit with their sensitive gastrointestinal tracts. There are no drugs specifically labeled or designed for long-term arthritis treatment in rabbits, so it is most likely that anything you use will be off-label usage.</p><p>Diets and supplements with added ingredients are also available for rabbits with arthritis. These items are designed for aiding in the treatment of osteoarthritis in rabbits but may not be enough by themselves to completely resolve thelimping. Omega fatty acids, glucosamine, turmeric, and other natural ingredients may help your rabbit feel better and prevent further joint problems in the future.</p><h2>Overgrown Nails </h2><p>If your rabbit spends time on rough surfaces, they may grind their nails down naturally but most pet rabbits require regular nail trims. If a rabbit goes too long without a nail trim, the nails will continue to grow and sometimes grow into the pad of the foot or break off at the quick and cause pain or discomfort.</p><p>If your rabbit's nail has curled into their footpad, the long nail will need to be trimmed and removed from the pad. It will most likely bleed and your rabbit may need antibiotics, pain medications, and perhaps even a bandage. If the nails are simply too long, they may snag on carpeting or in the cage, tear off, and cause bleeding.</p><p>These can usually be managed at home if you have styptic powder, but if your rabbit is in too much discomfort they may appreciate pain medications. Make sure that regardless of the nail injury your rabbit's feet stay clean. Dirty feet will cause a nail injury location to get infected.</p><h2>Dislocation </h2><p>Joints can become dislocated in rabbits like they can other animals and people. When a joint ""pops out of place"" it is called a dislocation and sometimes it needs help going back into place. If a joint is dislocated (such as the hip or knee joint), your rabbit may limp until it pops back into place. If a joint is dislocated for too long, it cannot be replaced. Do not wait to see what happens if you suspect your rabbit has a dislocation; make an appointment with your vet.</p><h2>Spinal Issues </h2><p>Rabbits can injure their back by kicking too hard, being dropped, and with intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). Sometimes it is a chronic problem (with discs that bulge, become inflamed, and put pressure on the spinal cord) and other times it is an acute issue (from trauma) but regardless, spinal issues may cause your rabbit to limp and wobble.</p><p>Spinal issues are serious in any species, and your exotics vet should be consulted if you are worried about your rabbit's back. Radiographs and other imaging such as MRI or CT may be recommended to aid in diagnosis and steroids, pain medications, and other drugs may be prescribed to treat your rabbit.</p><h2>Soft Tissue Injuries </h2><p>Sprains, strains,and other soft-tissue injuries may cause your rabbit to limp. A fracture or dislocation may outwardly look similar to a soft tissue injury but surgery is not needed. Anti-inflammatory and pain medications are usually prescribed along with rest, but thankfully soft tissue injuries usually self-correct over time (unless a ligament or tendon is torn which will require an MRI or CT scan to diagnose).</p>",1321
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-ferret-diseases-4145803,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Identifying and Treating Common Ferret Diseases</h1>,"<h1>Identifying and Treating Common Ferret Diseases</h1><p>Ferrets are extremely entertaining exotic pets but just like dogs and cats, they are prone to a variety of illnesses. By learning about the common diseases your ferret can get you'll be better prepared to recognize the signs and symptoms of them or even possibly prevent your ferret from getting sick.</p><h2>Ferret Distemper </h2><p>Due to vaccinations for this disease, distemper is not as widely seen as it used to be, but it is still a major concern to pet ferrets. Distemper is fatal and very contagious therefore it is taken seriously in the ferret owner community. Most ferrets receive their first distemper vaccination from the breeding facility but it must get a booster shot about three weeks later and annually after that.</p><p>The disease shows symptoms of watery eyes and inflammation initially but ferrets with distemper will all develop crusty food pads and parts of their face. These skin changes are classic for the disease.</p><h2>Ferret Adrenal Gland Disease </h2><p>Adrenal gland disease may be the most common ferret disease of them all. There are still several factors that may cause this ailment but there is no true cure for it. It is thought that early spay and neuter practices may play a role in developing adrenal gland disease but diet and a lack of UVB exposure are also thought to be contributors.</p><p>Different hormones, including sex hormones, are secreted by the adrenal glands. It is thought that since the reproductive organs of a ferret have been removed at such a young age and the adrenal glands still produce sex hormones throughout their life, the glands become enlarged and cancerous. An implant or injections are often used to manage the hormone secretions throughout the lifetime of a ferret with the disease.</p><p>Symptoms of adrenal gland disease include hair loss, vulvar enlargement, prostatic inflammation (causing an inability to urinate in male ferrets), itchiness, and aggression.</p><h2>Ferret Lymphoma</h2><p>Lymphoma is a terrible cancer of ferrets that affects the lymph nodes. It is fatal and there is no known prevention for it.</p><p>Lymphoma is usually suspected when a lymph node is visibly enlarged. Ferrets, like other animals, have lymph nodes in multiple locations on their bodies. On their neck, in their armpits, and on the back of their hind legs are the most commonly noted places for enlarged lymph nodes in ferrets. But sometimes abdominal surgery reveals enlarged lymph nodes that wouldn't be seen externally.</p><p>Not all enlarged lymph nodes are cancerous though. Infections can cause lymph nodes to temporarily swell.</p><h2>Ferret DilatedCardiomyopathy </h2><p>This is a heart condition that can cause sudden death in pet ferrets and while it isn't as common as some other diseases, it is still a concern for ferret owners. Taurine is an ingredient in quality ferret food and whole prey that may play a role in heart health but it is unknown if the exclusion of it causes dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p>Dilated cardiomyopathy can be thought of as heart failure in ferrets. Symptoms ferret owners might see include weakness, lethargy, coughing, and an increased respiratory rate (breathing fast). This is because the heart is working harder due to the disease process. The disease may be difficult to diagnose at first unless your vet hears a heart murmur or you have an echocardiogram performed. Medications may be prescribed to decrease how much effort the heart has to make to pump blood but there is no cure for dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><h2>Ferret Insulinoma</h2><p>While diabetes causes blood sugar to spike, insulinoma causes a ferret's blood sugar to drop. One might think of this disease as the opposite of diabetes since it creates an overactive pancreas. Like diabetes, the diet may play an important role in this disease of ferrets. The cells of the pancreas develop tumors that secrete more insulin than is necessary for a ferret, therefore the glucose (blood sugar) level drops and the ferret becomes lethargic. If the blood sugar drops too low, seizures, coma, and death can occur which makes this disease so scary.</p><p>Signs of insulinoma in a ferret are usually excessive sleeping, lethargy, slobbering or pawing at the roof of the mouth or dragging their hindlimb legs. A simple blood sugar test at the vet's office typically diagnoses this tumor of the pancreas and steroids are usually prescribed. Surgery is sometimes performed to remove part of the ferret's pancreas and may allow a ferret to no longer require medication and regulate their own glucose levels once again. Diet also plays a huge role in the success of managing a ferret with insulinoma since regular spikes in blood sugar from eating may stress the pancreas more, leading to poor disease management.</p><h2>Ferret Gastrointestinal Obstruction </h2><p>Ferrets are quite the mischievous critters and because of that they often get themselves into trouble when they consume objects that aren't meant to be eaten. Rubbery items are especially tempting to ferrets due to the squishy texture and chewing sometimes leads to swallowing. These foreign items can obstruct or block a ferret's gastrointestinal tract and if they aren't removed, they can be life-threatening.</p><p>It may be difficult to know if your ferret ate something that will cause obstruction but after a little while, your ferret will start to stop defecating and vomiting. They won't be able to keep food down, will lose weight, become lethargic, and may seem painful in their abdomen when you pick them up. A radiograph (x-ray) or ultrasound may be able to diagnose a foreign object and obstruction and then surgery or endoscopic retrieval will follow depending on what the item is and where it is located.</p><p>Preventing gastrointestinal obstructions may sound easy but usually, owners don't even know how their ferrets got their paws on what they shouldn't have eaten. Remote buttons that have been chewed off, small items dropped on the floor, key chains, fridge magnets, and more have all been found in ferret tummies.</p><p>Hairballs can also cause an obstruction. These are called trichobezoars and won't show up on a radiograph but cause the same symptoms as other items that are stuck in your ferret. Hair won't break down in the stomach or intestines so it usually accumulates and then causes a blockage that won't allow food to pass through. They often need to be surgically removed like foreign objects.</p><h2>Ferret Aplastic Anemia </h2><p>If you've ever wondered why ferrets are spayed at such a young age it's because of aplastic anemia. Female ferrets that go into heat need to mate to stop their bodies from producing large amounts of estrogen and suppressing bone marrow. Blood is produced in the bone marrow so if this production is suppressed the ferret becomes anemic.</p><p>Symptoms of anemia are usually lethargy, weakness, and pale gums. Ferrets that have been in heat for more than a few weeks are at risk of becoming anemic. Thankfully it is treatable by your vet and preventable by spaying your ferret.</p><h2>Ferret Dental Disease </h2><p>Ferrets have teeth and with teeth comes dental disease if they aren't properly cared for. Not many people brush their ferret's teeth but they can offer foods that those teeth are designed for. Kibble does not cater to the health of ferret teeth but whole prey items, like mice and chicks, do. Ferrets are made to tear apart their food and crunch on bones but most owners can't even fathom the thought of their ferret doing what comes naturally to them, so they feed them ferret kibble instead.</p><p>Diseased teeth cause pain, bad breath, and you may see your ferret repeatedly licking their lips or pawing at their face. Bad teeth can be extracted by your vet but better yet, dental disease can be prevented with proper diets, chew toys, or someone brave enough to brush their ferret's teeth.</p>",1318
7,https://www.thesprucepets.com/himalayan-guinea-pig-5223355,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>How to Care for a Himalayan Guinea Pig</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Himalayan Guinea Pig</h1><p>Guinea pigs are very popular pets. Not only do they make great family pets because they are the perfect size for children but they also come in a variety of beautiful fur patterns that appeal to people of all ages. One such fur pattern is called Himalayan and this pattern describes a uniquely colored guinea pig.</p><p>Himalayan guinea pigs are albino cavies; they have all white fur and red eyes. These guinea pigs are not a separate species from other guinea pigs but are instead a specific breed. What makes them different, though, is the fur on their face, ears, and feet which is black or brown. Many refer to Himalayan guinea pigs as the Siamese cats of the guinea pig world because of their similar characteristic markings referred to as points.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s) Himalayan Guinea Pig</p><p>Scientific Name</p><p>Adult Size8-10 inches long, 1.5-2.5 lbs.</p><p>LifespanAverage lifespan in captivity is 4-5 years, but it is not uncommon to have one that lives up to 8 years. The longest-lived guinea pig was recorded to be 14 years old, but this is very rare.</p><h2>Himalayan Guinea Pig Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Like other guinea pigs, Himalayans are very social pets. They thrive when they live with other guinea pigs and love interaction with their owners, too. When they are used to being handled, they enjoy being pet, talked to, and snacking on their favorite treats. Guinea pigs are not aggressive animals but as with any pet, if they are frightened, hurt, or startled, they can nip.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Himalayan guinea pigs are a standard-sized guinea pig. Most guinea pigs grow to be about 8-10 inches in length and weight about 1.5 to 2.5 lbs. when they are full grown. They are short animals that do not have tails.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>When it comes to housing your Himalayan guinea pig, you should pay special attention to the flooring of their habitat. Guinea pigs can get their tiny feet stuck in wire cage bottoms or develop infections and problems, such as bumblefoot, if the floor is too dirty. Choose a large enclosure with a solid floor. The height of the cage is not important because guinea pigs don't jump or climb but you should have at least 2 x 5 ft of floor space for two cavies. Additionally, make sure your guinea pig can't get its head stuck in the bars of the cage or escape.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Because Himalayan guinea pigs are primarily white, avoid cage bedding that is dyed or has newspaper ink on it because these items are likely to discolor your pig. Additionally, avoid pine and cedar wood shavings; they can be irritating to your cavy's respiratory tract. Opt instead for paper beddings that are free of dyes and that will help absorb urine.</p><h2>What Do Himalayan Guinea Pigs Eat & Drink? </h2><p>All guinea pigs are herbivores, so they only eat plants. An adult Himalayan guinea pig's diet should be primarily made up of grass hays, such as Timothy or Orchard, with guinea pig pellets, fresh vegetables, and fresh fruits rounding out their meals. It is vital to ensure adequate vitamin C is consumed by your guinea pig, so be sure to pay attention to the expiration date of your guinea pig's pellets so this vitamin doesn't expire before your cavy can reap its benefits. Additionally, give vitamin C treats to supplement this essential vitamin. You can also feed vitamin C rich vegetables, such as bell peppers! Finally, fresh drinking water should always be provided. While some water is consumed from the fruits and veggies your pig will eat, a water bottle and bowl of water should also be readily available.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Guinea pigs can have health problems with their teeth and develop bladder stones, bumblefoot, lice, respiratory diseases, scurvy, broken legs, ileus, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, uterine cancer, ovarian cysts pyometra, and more. Regular/yearly check-ups with a vet that is comfortable treating pockets pets is recommended.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>It's important to your guinea pig's physical and mental health to spend time outside the cage. Make sure you provide a safe place for your guinea pig to run around on a regular basis. Wheels and balls that hamsters commonly use are not ideal for guinea pigs. Consider an X-pen to keep them outside of their cage safely to roam around. </p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Himalayan guinea pigs have short hair so grooming is limited to the occasional cleaning of feet, the hind end, and bathing when necessary. Hair trimming is needed but some guinea pigs may need their nails trimmed.</p><h3>Baths </h3><p>If you must bathe your guinea pig, be careful they don't get too cold while wet or overheat it when drying it. Use lukewarm water and a gentle shampoo or soap to bathe (dish soap is harsh on the skin and isn't recommended by small mammal veterinarians) and when it's time to dry your cavy, towel dry it. Avoid using a hairdryer as this can easily overheat your pig.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Guinea pigs require fresh bedding on a weekly basis, plentiful hay, pellets designed for guinea pigs, and some fresh fruits and veggies. Costs will vary but expect to spend around $10 a week keeping your pig fed and clean. Veterinary visits average around $50-$80 for an examination and are recommended at least yearly. If your veterinarian finds problems at the visit, testing and medications will be additional costs.  </p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Himalayan Guinea Pig as a Pet </h2><p>Guinea pigs are not the kind of pet that you take on a walk, but they are interactive and social. They also live longer than most hamsters but not as long as a dog or a cat. They are fairly easy to care for but require regular cleaning, fresh food preparation, and attention. They do make noises so they aren't as quiet as a rabbit but they also aren't as loud as a bird.</p><h2>Similar Pocket Pets to the Himalayan Guinea Pig </h2> <p>Otherwise, check outother guinea pig breeds that can be your new pet!</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Himalayan Guinea Pig </h2><p>Since Himalayan guinea pigs are not the most common breed of guinea pigs, you will likely need to find a breeder to purchase your pig. Cavy shows, county fairs, and clubs are good resources to find a Himalayan guinea pig breeder near you.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>If you have a male and female guinea pig, it is very likely that they will try to breed therefore it is recommended to house two females together, unless you plan to have your female cavy spayed. Guinea pigs usually only have one or two babies, but the birth can be very stressful and even life threatening for the mother. Female guinea pigs must be bred by the time they are only a few months old, otherwise their pubic symphysis fuses and a C-section will be necessary to save both the mother and the babies.</p><h2>FAQ Block </h2><p>Yes! Himalayan guinea pigs are great pets for kids. They aren't as fragile as some other small pets and are not likely to bite.</p><p>Because Himalayan guinea pigs are not as common as other breeds of cavies, they may cost a little more than more common breeds, but you can still expect to pay anywhere from $50-100 for one.</p>",1259
8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-care-for-a-pet-snail-5217500,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Snail</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Snail</h1><p>There is more than one type of snail in the world, but the garden snail is the species that has quickly grown in popularity as a pet. Historically, Giant African land snails were also a popular option for snail-lovers but due to the threat they cause to crops as an invasive species, they are illegal in the United States.</p><p>Garden snails, however, are much smaller than their giant cousins, so the damage they can cause is not a concern. These small snails have found their way into the hearts and homes of pet owners across the country and make unique pets for those that are looking for something a little different.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s) Garden Snail, Land Snail, European Brown Snail</p><p>Scientific Name previously</p><p>Adult SizeShell size of 11 58inches in diameter and 11 38inches high</p><p>Lifespan Most snails live 2-3 years is expected but longer lifespans have been reported as pets</p><h2>Snail Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Snails are quiet, slow, and curious creatures. They move by sliding around on their single foot, which is covered in mucus and epithelial cilia. As the foot muscles contract, the snail crawls forward. They don't jump, but they can climb up the side of an aquarium or plant to get where they want to go. Snails are docile and don't bite, so they make a very easy pet. </p><h3>Handling </h3><p>Overall, caring for snails is simple, but they don't make cuddly pets. Handling a snail should be done with care as you can cause permanent even lethal damage to them if you pick them up the wrong way. A snail won't make a sound, scratch, or bite if you are hurting them, but it's easy to unintentionally harm them when picking them up. To prevent this unintentional harm, snails should never be picked up by their shell. You should instead let a snail crawl onto your hand on their own or gently use a tongue depressor or popsicle stick to put under their body.</p><p>Alternatively, some people will poke at a snail until it retreats into its shell so it is no longer stuck to something and can then be picked up by the shell. Because a snail's shell is attached to its body inside, picking it up by its shell if its foot is stuck to something could damage the shell and the mantle. The mantle is the connection between your snail's body and its shell- this can collapse and kill your snail if damaged.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Most garden or land snails don't grow over 2 inches in shell size, but there are thousands of different types of snails, some of which can grow much larger. The Giant African Land snail, and formerly is the largest variety of snail at about 6 inches in length, but these snails are illegal to own as pets. The smallest land snails, , are as tiny as the tip of a ballpoint pen.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>The best way to house a pet snail is in a glass, plastic aquarium, or terrarium. This will give your snail a safe place to crawl around as well as more surface area for it to climb. Aquariums and terrariums are easy to wipe down and wash when necessary, keep the bedding contained, and help hold in moisture. Measure your humidity with a hydrogmeter to know what humidity your enclosure is at and if it needs to be changed per each species humidity requirements. A small, shallow dish of water should be placed in the enclosure to provide humidity, and allow your snail to bathe if desired. If humidity Finally, provide a small house for shelter, so your snail can retreat to somewhere private when it sleeps.</p><h2>Specific Substrate Needs </h2><p>Snails do well on a couple of inches of natural substrates, such as compost, coconut fiber, potting soil, and other dirt-like bedding. Be careful to select a bedding that is free of fertilizers and if it notes a pH on the package, choose one that has a pH of 7 or higher. Certain substrates, such as sphagum moss, help retain humidity in the enclosure and are a great addition on top of bedding. Finally, freezing your soil prior to putting it in your snail's enclosure will help kill off any tiny pests that may be living in it.</p><h2>What Do Snails Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Garden snails are herbivores, so they strictly eat plants. Various fruits and vegetables can be given to your snails in addition to a cuttlebone to provide it with calcium for its shell. Other sources of calcium for your pet snail can include finely ground egg shells or oyster shells sprinkled on vegetables. Provide lettuce, bananas, strawberries, apples, cucumbers, broccolis, carrots, and other easily accessible produce on rotation to your snail, but be sure they are all pesticide-free. Snails also require that a small portion of their diet contain a protein source; some pre-made products are available for sale online. Other protein options include bloodworms, dried mealworms, or fish flakes. Do your research on the species you own to know how often and how much protein to feed your snail.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>While snails don't frequent the veterinarian, they are still susceptible to health problems. A collapsed mantle from inappropriate handling is a serious problem that often occurs in snails. Additionally, a calcium deficiency can cause the shell to soften and not grow properly. Other health problems you may see are oral prolapse from eating something irritating, deep retraction (you can no longer see your snail's foot), and broken shells.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Snails are very inexpensive to care for. Occasional substrate changes and fresh food are the only ongoing costs involved with having a snail. Once you get its aquarium set-up, keeping your snail clean and fed is all that is required. Some owners recruit the help of tiny crawling insects, such as isopods or woodlice, to help keep the snail's environment clean by eating the debris produced by the snail and its diet. </p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Snail as a Pet </h2><p>Depending on what kind of pet you're looking for, a snail may or may not fit the bill. Snails are very quiet, don't take up much space, do not require much of a time commitment, and are inexpensive. However, snails are also not cuddly, can't be trained, and usually only live a couple of years. </p><h2>Purchasing or Finding Your Snail </h2><p>Many people that decide to have a pet snail find their new pet outside in the garden or under a log (check your state laws to determine if the species of snail is legal to take from the wild), but there are also other places to purchase a snail. Several online sites and breeders sell different kinds of pet snails including previously These snails cost around $10 or more plus shipping. Some pet stores may sell land snails, but most large chain stores only sell aquatic snails, so your best bet is often finding one outside.</p><p></p><p>Snails are easy for kids to care for but are not great pets for handling. If your child is interested in pet fish, hermit crabs, and other small pets that aren't cuddly, a snail may be a good alternative.</p><p>Snails don't mind sliding around on your hand, but it is unlikely that they will crawl toward your hand to be held. Snails are simple creatures and focus finding food more than seeking attention from a person.</p><p>It is unlikely that a snail will recognize its owners like some other pets would. This isn't to say it's impossible, but snails have bad eyesight.</p><p>Snails will defecate as often as they eat, if not more. Stool passes through their digestive tracts quickly, and many snail owners joke that their snails do nothing but poop.</p>",1278

To keep these cats healthy and happy, serval owners must provide large outdoor enclosures in locations that stay warm year-round. Ownership of a serval cat is illegal in many places. Licenses, permits, and inspections are required in others. Check your local laws before seeking a breeder and an exotic animal veterinarian.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Independent, aloof, intelligent, athletic</p><p>Weight:20 to 40 pounds</p><p>Length: 2 feet</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Golden yellow to buff with black spots and stripes</p><p>Coat Patterns: Spotted</p><p>Eye Color: Amber</p><p>Lifespan:Up to 22 years in captivity </p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Africa</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Wild Serval</h3><h2>Serval Cat Characteristics </h2><p>The serval cat is better adapted to life in the wild than in humans' homes. Although it's not extremely vocal, it can make a variety ofnoises that may concern neighbors, including high-pitched cries, growls, and spitting hisses.</p><p>Having the longest legs of any cat (in proportion to its body), the serval is an agile jumper and avid digger. It can leap to catch birds over five feet in the air and dig to find prey like ground squirrels. This tall, active hunter needs more room to roam than most households can offer, and the challenge of fulfilling its dietary needs is daunting.</p><p>The serval has little interest in being stroked or cuddled. Because of its large size (up to 40 pounds), naturally wild temperament, and aloof personality, this cat is not recommended for homes with kids or other pets. A serval can bond well with one person and become emotionally attached to an extent that re-homing the animal would cause it deep distress.</p><h2>History of the Serval Cat </h2><p>The serval cat hails from Africa where tall grass and bushes camouflage this stealthy hunter, allowing it to sneak up on its prey. Servals resemble cheetahs but are smaller and have shorter tails and larger ears than their cousins. In the wild, servals are solitary and inhabit a home territory that spans about seven miles.</p><p>Serval cats have been kept by humans since the ancient Egyptians and are depicted in their art. However, they have never been fully domesticated. Breeding stock arrived in the U.S. over a century ago, and you may find serval cats that are many generations removed from African imports. Even such domestically-bred servals are subject to ownership restrictions per exotic animal laws.</p><p>Breeders have crossed serval cats with domestic cats to produce hybrids, such as the Savannah cat. A Savannah might be a better option than a serval if you like the look of the serval but need a tamer cat that is easier to care for.</p><h2>Serval Cat Care </h2><p>Large, secure outdoor enclosures are a must for these highly active andsolitary catsthat roam several miles per day in the wild. Servals have been known to jump out of fenced areas or dig out under fences. An enclosure needs to be fenced on all sides (including the top), and the fencing should extend a few feet underground,</p><p>Provide a pool of water for drinking, swimming, and perhaps even allowing your serval cat to catch stocked fish.</p><p>A serval is not a suitable house pet because of its large size, high activity level, and tendency to jump. Not only will it threaten breakable objects and wires, but it can also be harmed by them. In addition, a serval cannot be fully litter-trained. Urinating on objects is their way of marking territory, and that includes furniture and walls when they are confined to human houses.</p><p>While many pet servals are declawed in the interest of preventing injury to humans, this is a painful practice that can cause infections and makes servals vulnerable in confrontations with other animals such as aggressive dogs).</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>A common veterinary emergency specific to servals is swallowing foreign objects, which can become lodged in their throats or difficult to pass. Servals are ravenous eaters, so they often get food lodged in their throats, which prompts them to regurgitate and re-consume it. If regurgitation is unsuccessful, a serval is at risk for choking.</p><p>If you decide to own a serval, ensure access to a veterinarian who can care for exotic pets. Servals need the same annual immunizations and de-wormings as domestic cats, but ordinary small animal vets will be reluctant or unwilling to treat servals since they are technically wild animals.</p><h2>Appearance </h2><p>Servals are larger and taller than domestic cats, reaching up to two feet tall at their shoulders and weighing up to 40 pounds.</p><p>These sleek and slender cats have relatively small heads with large, rounded ears. Servals have long necks which, when combined with their long legs, have earned them the nickname ""giraffe cats"" among those who observe them in the wild. Servals' tails are shorter than most cats in relation to their bodies.</p><p>Servals' coats are generally golden with black spots and lines and spots that occasionally connect to form lines. Their bellies are white, and their eyes are amber.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Ideally, a pet serval's diet should contain a variety of animal prey preferably living that it can pursue and devour as it would in the wild. Rodents, rabbits, birds, fish, insects, reptiles, and frogs are usually on the menu in Africa.</p><p>Servals use their sight and hearing more than their sense of smell to find their prey. They often play with their food before eating it. Servals are highly intelligent cats that appreciate games or puzzles that make meals, and their daily routines, more rewarding.</p><p>A formulated pelleted diet is an acceptable addition to a serval's diet but should not make upthe bulk of any meal, or the animal's health will decline.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Serval Cat </h2><p>Whether caught in the wild or bred in captivity, servals are wild animals and require a skilled, responsible owner who can meet this cat's exacting needs.</p><p>It is legal to own a serval in 16 states in the U.S. You can own a serval without a license in North Carolina, Alabama, Nevada, and Wisconsin. You can obtain a license to own a serval in Texas, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Maine, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, and South Dakota. In all the other states, serval ownership is illegal.</p><p>If it is legal to own a serval where you live, and you are looking for a reputable source for adopting or buying a serval, contact the Feline Conservation Foundation for more information.</p><h2>Serval Cat Overview </h2><p>Unlike most pets cats, servals are wild animals and must be owned with that fact in mind. They are large, active, and independent felines that require a diet of whole animals, preferably ones that are alive. The reasons not to own a serval arguably outweigh the good points.</p>",1151
10,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-set-up-a-thermal-gradient-1239118,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>How to Set Up a Thermal Gradient for Thermoregulation in Pet Reptiles</h1>,"<h1>How to Set Up a Thermal Gradient for Thermoregulation in Pet Reptiles</h1><p>Reptiles, amphibians, and other ectotherms use external heat sources in their environment to regulate their body temperatures. Ectothermic (also called poikilothermic) animals are often called ""cold-blooded"" which is a bit of a misnomer as they often maintain quite high body temperatures (sometimes higher than mammals). In the wild, ectotherms move around within their habitat (from sunlight to shade, or from above ground to burrows, for example) to regulate their body temperature. If they get too cool, their metabolism slows (and in conditions that are too hot or too cold, enter states of inactivity or hibernation).</p><p>Maintaining the appropriate temperature is vital to bodily functions such as digestion and brumation. When keeping ectothermic animals, it is important to provide the proper temperature conditions in order for the animal to grow and thrive.</p><p>For many reptiles, it is not simply a matter of providing a constant temperature, however. They require a thermal gradient or a range of temperatures from a high end to a low end. Thus, the animal can move to a higher temperature or lower temperature to suit its needs at any given time.</p><h2>How to Set Up a Thermal Gradient </h2><p>Simply stated, you provide a gradient by providing heat at one end of a terrarium or enclosure. Whether you use heat mats, basking lights, heat lamps, ceramic heating elements, or a combination of these, they should all be placed at one end of the tank. This produces a natural gradient where it is warmer at one end or the other.</p><p>In the example shown above, heating components would be placed at one end of the tank, producing higher temperatures at that end of the tank than at the low end, where no additional heat is provided. Please note this is a completely fictional example since the photo is of my hermit crab tank and the temperatures given are simple an example of ideals for a corn snake (not what I provide for my crabs!).</p><p>If you have a species that also requires UVA/UVB lighting, that the UV producing light is placed in the same area as the heat source. Sometimes the UV producing bulb will run the length of the terrarium, which is fine, as long as the bulb overlaps the basking spot/heating zone. This is to ensure that as your animal basks in the heat, it also gets to absorb UVB, which is what would happen naturally.</p><p>In the wild, most species experience a temperature drop at night, and this should also be considered. The temperature for most reptiles should be dropped at night to mimic natural conditions (check for your species for exact ranges). This usually means turning off some or all heaters, or switching to a lower wattage heat source at night.</p><h2>What Heat Sources to Use </h2><p>There is no simple answer to that question, as it depends on the species, your preferences, your equipment, and your home. There is no hard and fast rule as to which size heat mat or bulb will give you the gradient your reptile needs, either, as it depends on the ambient temperature and your set up (substrate choice and depth, etc.). It also depends on what sort of temperature drop your reptile can tolerate at night. It takes research as to how best to meet the needs of your reptile, as well as some experimentation with your equipment to reach the ideal set up.</p><p>Some examples of heat sources you can use in your terrarium are shown on the next few pages. Remember, any of these heat sources, alone or in combination, will be placed at the warm end of your terrarium.</p><h2>Using Light Bulbs for Heating Terrariums </h2><p>There is a wide variety of light bulbs that can be used for heating. Again, depending on how your terrarium is set up, you may need to experiment with wattage to get the correct temperatures. Also, keep in mind that bulbs that produce bright or white light cannot be used at night. Some options include</p><p>Photo courtesy Zoo Med Laboratories, Inc.</p><h2>Ceramic Heat Emitters </h2><p>Ceramic heat emitters look a bit like odd light bulbs, but they are actually very efficient heaters that give off no light so do not impact the light-dark cycle (and therefore can be used day or night). They give off intense heat and should only be used with special porcelain receptacles as they can melt normal plastic receptacles. There are special clamp on lamps available for use with ceramic heat emitters.</p><p>Ceramic heat emitters get very hotand must be shielded from your animals or serious burns could result. You also need to be careful about touching these heaters yourself when doing terrarium maintenance. Despite the intensity of the heat, the heat from these does not tend to radiate great lengths so may not be effective at heating large enclosures.</p><p>These can also be used with thermostats and rheostats.</p><p>Photo courtesy Zoo Med Laboratories, Inc.</p><h2>Undertank Heat Mats </h2><p>Undertank Heat Mats are low wattage heat mats that can be used under the tank as well as on the side of the tank. The ones shown here from Zoo Med have an adhesive backing and are applied right to the glass of the tank. If used under the tank, the tank must be raised on the rubber feet (provided) or some other arrangement to allow air to circulate under the tank and prevent overheating under the tank. These do have the disadvantage that once they are adhered to the tank, they cannot be removed and reused safely, so it makes cleaning and rearranging more difficult.</p><p>These mats come in a variety of sizes and wattages. There are guidelines on the packaging for the size of tank the mats are appropriate for heating. The heat achieved in your tank will depend on the ambient temperature and your set up (type and depth of substrate, for example). For tropical or basking species that need higher temperatures, these function best as a secondary (perhaps 24 hour) heat source, used in conjunction with an overhead heat source for basking. They can also be used with a thermostat or rheostat.</p><p>Photo courtesy Zoo Med Laboratories, Inc.</p><h2>Other Heating Elements </h2><p>Mercury vapor lights: these produce both UVA and UVB as well as heat from a single source. Some experts have expressed concern over the intensity of the UV rays produced by these and their long-term safety, while others have used them without apparent problems. It is prudent to make sure your reptile has shaded areas in the terrarium if you use these, but they do have the advantage of covering both heat and light needs in one fixture, and although expensive they tend to be longer lasting than UV fluorescent. They should only be used in ceramic sockets.</p><p>Heat Rocks: I do not recommend these, especially older models. In the past reptiles have been known to sustain serious burns and many experts recommend avoiding heat sources with which a reptile can have direct contact. They also are not as effective at heating the ambient environment as some other sources, and I think with safer and more natural options such as overhead heating, these are best avoided.</p><p>Heat Cables: these are a fairly new addition to the market and offer a flexible heating alternative, and can be used in the tank, under the tank, or in breeding racks. I would probably stick to using these outside the tank.</p><h2>Safety for Your Reptile: Overheating and Fire Hazards </h2><p>It is important to make sure proper temperatures are maintained at all times, as well as making sure your reptile cannot be burned by the heat source.</p><h2>Safety for Your Home: Avoiding Fire Hazards From Reptile Heat Sources </h2>",1268

Like humans and many other animal species, ferrets can be infected by various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. However, the coronavirus most likely to strike your pet ferret is ferret enteric coronavirus, (FRECV) which causes an illness commonly called green slime disease, but properly termed epizootic catarrhal enteritis.</p><p>This infection results in profuse diarrhea, which is often a bright green color and has a seed-like texture. Ferrets of any age can become sick with green slime disease, but symptoms are likely to be more severe in seniors. The ill ferret can become dehydrated and lose its appetite. Luckily, most ferrets recover, but epizootic catarrhal enteritis is quite contagious and easily spread amongst ferrets in close proximity, such as at a pet show or in a pet store.</p><p>Ferrets can also become infected with ferret systemic coronavirus, (FRSCV) which also typically causes diarrhea and weight loss.</p><h2>What Is Coronavirus? </h2><p>The coronavirus family includes many different viruses capable of causing disease in a wide variety of animals, including humans, cats, dogs, camels, pigs, bats, ferrets, and many others. Typically, diseases caused by coronaviruses cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, such as cough or diarrhea. There are three coronaviruses in particular that can sicken your ferret.</p><h3>Ferret Enteric Coronavirus (FRECV) </h3><p>The form of coronavirus that most commonly affects ferrets, ferret enteric coronavirus, causes a disease called epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE). It's more commonly called green slime or green poop disease, however, due to the green diarrhea that's its chief symptom. ECE starts with liver inflammation that then spreads into the intestines, causing the death of cells lining the intestinal tract.</p><p>Ferrets with green slime disease often develop severe diarrhea that tends to have blood in it or look green, slimy, and even fluorescent due to the damage it causes to the intestines. This diarrhea is also seen alongside lethargy and dehydration that results in sunken eyes and skin tenting. Some ferrets don't show any signs of illness, however, but are still able to spread the virus to other ferrets.</p><h3>Sars-CoV-2 </h3><p>The pathogen behind COVID-19, Sars-CoV-19 can cause a mild cough and fever, but in general, ferrets do not appear to become seriously ill from COVID-19. While there is still some uncertainty, it appears that ferrets can catch COVID-19 from humans, but are very unlikely to transmit it to their owner. Still, if you have tested positive for COVID-19, have someone else care for your ferret until you recover.</p><h3>Ferret Systemic Coronavirus (FRSCV) </h3><p>The third type of coronavirus that may affect a ferret is one that mimics feline peritonitis and is referred to as ferret systemic coronavirus or FRSCV. This is not a common type, but if a ferret contracts it, it is usually a young animal and it may experience weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and an intestinal mass in the abdomen. FRSCV is progressive and usually leads to the death of the ferret within two months.</p><h2>Symptoms of Coronavirus in Ferrets </h2><p>Illnesses caused by coronaviruses can cause your ferret to become very ill with diarrhea, weight loss, and lack of appetite, can give it a cough, or can cause no symptoms at all. But should your pet ferret show any signs of illness, it's always best to consult with your veterinarian. The following are symptoms to watch for.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>If your ferret catches green slime disease, it might begin to show symptoms within two or three days, although the virus is believed to survive in infected feces for as long as six months. The first signs of illness are usually loss of appetite, vomiting, and then green diarrhea. Note that green diarrhea is not exclusive to green slime disease, however.</p><p>A very ill ferret will eventually lose weight, develop dehydration, and become lethargic. Most ferrets do not become this ill, however.</p><p>Ferrets with other forms of coronavirus disease can also have diarrhea or might have a cough and a fever.</p><h2>Causes of Coronavirus </h2><p>Coronaviruses are ball-like viruses covered with small ""spikes"" of protein. The word ""corona"" comes from the Latin word for crown, as the spikes give the virus a somewhat crown-like appearance. The viruses uses the spikes to attach to healthy cells inside their host, whether that be a ferret, human, or some other animal. Once attached, the virus injects its own genetic material into the healthy host cell, overriding the host cell's own genetic information. This means that the once-healthy host cells turn into ""breeding centers"" for more coronaviruses, instead of dividing into their own type of cell. Thus the infection spreads through the ferret or other infected animal.</p><h2>Diagnosing Coronavirus in Ferrets </h2><p>Diagnosis of green slime is typically made by analyzing liver enzyme levels, stool character, and observations of other symptoms. Electron microscopy of the stool may show the virus but this is not commonly performed. Your veterinarian may also order a complete blood count to see if the ferret has elevated white blood cells, which indicates some type of infection.</p><p>Diagnosis of COVID-19 in ferrets is made based on exposure history to an infected ferret or person and a fever, but coughing may or may not be present. A special test called a RealPCR test will confirm the diagnosis but other respiratory diseases like influenza should be ruled out first.</p><p>Ferret systemic coronavirus is diagnosed based on symptoms, as well as blood tests showing anemia and abnormal results for kidney or liver function.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment of coronavirus depends on the symptoms involved. There is no direct cure for any of the illnesses this virus causes in ferrets, but supportive treatment can help your ferret recover sooner, or keep it comfortable during the progression of ferret systemic coronavirus.</p><p>Typically, your veterinarian will order fluids delivered subcutaneously if your ferret is dehydrated. A bland diet often tempts ferrets who have lost their appetites to eat and is easy on their digestive systems. Anti-inflammatories might be used to help relieve intestinal inflammation. If your ferret has ferret systemic coronavirus, the vet may also recommend treatment with steroids, which will not cure the disease but may extend your ferret's survival time.</p><h2>Prognosis for Ferrets With Coronavirus </h2><p>Most ferrets with green slime disease or COVID-19 will recover, although senior ferrets are at higher risk of succumbing to the infection. However, ferret systemic coronavirus is a progressive disease that leads to the death of the animal, usually within two months.</p><h2>How to Prevent Coronavirus </h2><p>The best way you can truly prevent coronavirus from occurring in your ferret is to keep it away from other ferrets or from other people who may have spent time around ferrets of their own. This, of course, can be difficult since not all people and ferrets show symptoms, but it will greatly decrease the likelihood of your ferret catching a coronavirus.</p><p>New ferrets being introduced into a household that already has ferrets should be kept separated from the preexisting ferrets for a couple of weeks to watch for any symptoms of coronavirus or other diseases. You should also wash your hands in between handling your own ferret and any others to prevent transmitting the virus or other diseases.</p><h2>Is Ferret Coronavirus Contagious to Other Animals? </h2><p>Ferret enteric coronavirus and ferret systemic coronavirus are highly contagious between ferrets, as well as the closely related mink. These two viruses do not infect other species of animals, however. </p>",1242
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-rabbit-diseases-4137309,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>The Most Common Rabbit Diseases</h1>,"<h1>The Most Common Rabbit Diseases</h1><p>Rabbits are important parts of many families that have had the experience of caring for them. But unfortunately, and just like other pets, rabbits are prone to a variety of problems and diseases. Some diseases are more common than others but by being educated on these problems you may be able to prevent them, or at least learn to recognize the signs and symptoms more quickly in order to get your rabbit help.</p><h2>Rabbit Teeth Problems</h2><p>Rabbits have 28 teeth that help them grind their food. These teeth, unlike those of a dog or cat, grow continuously throughout the life of your rabbit. Without proper items to help keep these teeth trimmed (like hay and safe wood) the teeth can end up becoming overgrown and prevent your rabbit from being able to eat.</p><p>Molar teeth (the teeth in the back of the mouth) can grow and create a bridge over the tongue which can inhibit chewing and swallowing. Teeth that become this overgrown can cause your rabbit to starve.</p><p>Incisors teeth (the front teeth) will grow and start curling into the cheeks or other parts of your rabbit's mouth. This is very painful and can also cause your rabbit to stop eating.</p><p>Abscessed teeth can occur due to trauma or periodontal disease and are painful to your rabbit as well. These teeth need to be extracted in order to prevent the infection that is located around the tooth from spreading throughout your rabbit's body.</p><h2>Rabbit Reproductive Tumors </h2><p>Mammary, uterine, and ovarian tumors are far too common in pet female rabbits and testicular cancer does not go unnoticed in male rabbits. Spaying and neutering pet rabbits is recommended for a variety of reasons and one of these reasons is to prevent reproductive cancers. If your rabbit is fixed their chances of developing mammary cancer is greatly diminished (and it's impossible for them to develop uterine, ovarian, and testicular cancers if these parts have been removed). Discuss the risks associated with spaying and neutering your rabbit with your veterinarian as well as an appropriate age to have it performed.</p><h2>Rabbit Ear Mites </h2><p>Rabbits are known for their large ears but these ears aren't always clean. Ear mites are small arachnids that feed off of the wax and oil that rabbit ears produce. They are irritating and cause your rabbit to itch, scratch and shake their heads. Secondary infections from ear mites also occur if the ear mites are left untreated and include bacterial and fungal infections. Large amounts of dark, crusty debris are usually seen in rabbit ears that have ear mites.</p><p>Rabbits can get ear mites from direct contact with other rabbits, from being outside, and from our hands if we have recently handled an infected rabbit and then pet our own rabbit without washing. They are easy to avoid but also easy to treat. Diagnosis can be done by your veterinarian by visualizing them under a microscope but sometimes you can even see large groups of them moving with your naked eye.</p><h2>Rabbit Abscesses </h2><p>While dental disease often causes abscesses in rabbits, these pockets of pus are seen all over rabbits. They can be found internally on organs as well as in the skin layer of rabbits which makes them difficult to treat. The type of bacteria that is usually inside these abscesses is also a factor that increases the difficulty level of treatment since it doesn't need oxygen to survive.</p><p>Antibiotics, cleaning out the abscess (if you can find it), and pain medications may all be prescribed for your rabbit by your veterinarian. Abscesses are serious and we don't always know why they occur but treatment is always needed as they do not go away on their own.</p><h2>Rabbit Ear Infections </h2><p>Middle or inner bacterial or fungal ear infections are a primary cause of head tilt and very common in rabbits. These infections may be difficult to detect though with a simple swab of the ear canal so treating the infection with ear medication may be done without a definitive diagnosis. Scratching at the ear, a foul odor, redness, and a drooping ear are also symptoms of an ear infection. </p><h2>Rabbit Ear Calcium Crystals </h2><p>Also experienced by some people, these tiny crystals aren't able to be visualized but cause major vertigo in rabbits. A head tilt and sometimes an inability to even stand up are experienced in rabbits with ear crystals or stones but the symptoms may disappear as quickly as they come on. Careful manipulation of the head and neck to dislodge the crystals can be performed otherwise your veterinarian may simply recommend waiting for them to move on their own.</p><h2>Rabbit Ileus</h2><p>Ileus is also known as GI stasis because it occurs when the normal peristalsis of the intestines stops. Food and hair doesn't get moved normally through your rabbit if it has ileus and gas then builds up. This causes your rabbit to be uncomfortable or painful as well as stop eating and defecating. Ileus is a life-threatening problem and needs immediate attention. Rabbits cannot typiaclly live for more than 48-72 hours if it is left untreated. Syringe feeding green vegetable baby food and water must be immediately done and a visit to your veterinarian must be made for medications and potential fluid administration.</p><h2>Rabbit Bumblefoot </h2><p>Also seen in pet rats, bumblefoot is a common problem in obese rabbits, rabbits that don't exercise, have a rough surface to sit and walk on, or who like to sit in their dirty litter boxes or bedding. It is technically referred to as pododermatitis and requires antibiotics, pain medications, a new cleaning plan for the cage, and often times dietary plans and bandaging to correct. It is very painful and your rabbit may limp or not want to walk if they have bumblefoot.</p><h2>What About Hairballs?</h2><p>Like cats, rabbits groom themselves and therefore ingest their hair. This hair is a not a problem by itself though so rabbits don't get hairballs like cats get. Their hair or fur is simply a normal part of their stomach contents. What can be problematic though, is if your rabbit ingests things it shouldn't or has ileus with dehydration.</p><p>If synthetic fibers from carpeting or toys mixes with the hair in your rabbit's stomach, it can cause an obstruction and some people will incorrectly refer to these obstructions as hairballs. These obstructions are actually very rare though and are not made up of just hair. Alternatively, a dehydrated rabbit with ileus can have issues passing the normal hair in their GI tract but the hair is not the problem - the dehydration and ileus are the issues.</p><h2>What About E. Cuniculi? </h2><p>You may be wondering why , or , is not on this list of common rabbit diseases but that is because it actually isn't common at all. Historically, head tilts were thought to be a result of this protozoan but according to Dr. Karen Rosenthal, a renowed exotic veterinarian, author, and educator, that is no longer the case due to the part of the brain that we know it affects. Additionally, there is no reliable test for in the United States since the antibody tests are simply showing a rabbit was exposed to it, not that it has an active infection or is causing problems in a rabbit. Veterinarians would often treat a rabbit with a head tilt with a medication called fenbendazole but this medication can cause serious liver and bone marrow issues and should not be used unless proven to be necessary.</p>",1238
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bumblefoot-in-rats-1238512,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Bumblefoot in Rats</h1>,"<h1>Bumblefoot in Rats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>There are plenty of great reasons to keep your pet rats at a healthy weight and provide comfortable living conditions for them, but preventing medical problems like bumblefoot is an especially important role for caregivers. This disease can develop when rats and other small pets are overweight, living in wire-floor cages, exposed to infected rats, or when owners do not clean urine and bodily waste from the rat enclosure regularly.</p><p>While bumblefoot is easy to prevent, it can cause uncomfortable symptoms like ulcers on the feet and even be potentially fatal to rats when left untreated. The bacteria that causes this disease is contagious to other rats. Thankfully, it is not contagious to humans, and owners can typically keep their pet rats safe from bumblefoot with a few preventative steps.</p><h2>What Is Bumblefoot? </h2><p>Bumblefoot () is a painful bacterial infection in pet rats that causes ulcers to develop on the bottoms of the animal's feet. This condition usually develops when a wound on the animal's body becomes infected with or often due to unsanitary conditions in the animal's enclosure. Small cuts or scrapes on the rat's feet allow the bacteria to enter the body. The infection leads to chronic inflammation and abscesses, and the name ""bumblefoot"" refers to the red lesions or ""bumbles"" that develop on the feet and cause the animal to limp.</p><p>Bumblefoot often occurs in rats that are obese or those that have a genetic predisposition to the ailment. Rabbits, birds, and other rodents are also susceptible to bumblefoot, but in rabbits, it's more commonly referred to as ""sore hocks."" Bumblefoot is also a major problem in chickens kept in captivity, particularly those kept in large numbers in small enclosures.</p><h2>Symptoms of Bumblefoot in Rats </h2> <h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Bumblefoot starts out as small reddened bumps that looka bit like calluses. Since the lesions first appear on the soles of the animal's feet, owners may not notice the symptoms of infection at this stage. However, these bumps can eventually become quite large. You may notice bloody footprints left behind by your pet rat. This sign occurs once the lesions have begun to bleed and scab over. Rats will become uncomfortable as pain increases, and owners will likely notice behavioral changes. If your rat is limping, licking its feet excessively, or acting reluctant to walk or climb normally, it's time to visit your small pet veterinarian.</p><h2>Causes of Bumblefoot </h2><p>There's a fair amount of disagreement about what cages or conditions may contribute to bumblefoot. However, it is generally believed that wire-floor cages, unsanitary living conditions, and health factors like obesity can make rats more prone to developing this disease. Whatever the specific cause, bumblefoot is almost exclusively a disease of animals kept in captivity, so keeping enclosures clean and free of irritants is crucial.</p><h2>Diagnosing Bumblefoot in Rats </h2><p>Once you've noticed symptoms of bumblefoot in your pet rat, a visit to your veterinarian is necessary. Your vet will do a physical examination on the animal, taking care to focus on its feet, and determine whether bumblefoot may be the cause. If this disease is suspected, samples will be taken to be tested in a laboratory. Your veterinarian will conduct culture and sensitivity tests on your pet to determine which bacteria caused the infection. This allows them to confirm the diagnosis and choose an antibiotic that will be most effective in treating your rat's case of bumblefoot.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>A combination of oral antibiotics along with topical cleaning and treatment of your rat's wounds (as directed by your vet) is usually the first course of treatment for bumblefoot. When lesions do not respond to this treatment, your vet may recommend surgery. However, this has significant risks and limited success.</p><p>For bumblefoot lesions that do not respond to this basic treatment, surgical treatment may be necessary, but this has significant risks and limited success. Most importantly, owners should seek professional help as soon as possible if any symptoms of bumblefoot appear on their pets.</p><p>Treatment of the disease also includes sanitizing your rat's cage. Owners should remove all rats from the enclosure and take any additional rats to a veterinarian for examination (even if they appear unaffected). Thoroughly clean the cage, taking care to sanitize the entirety of the enclosure along with food and water bowls or toys. Add fresh, soft bedding to prevent future lesions on your pet's feet.</p><h2>Prognosis for Rats With Bumblefoot </h2><p>Because the severity of bumblefoot cases can vary, your specific rat's prognosis will depend on its condition and your veterinarian's recommendations for treatment. However, not all pets respond well. Amputation of badly infected toes and feet is sometimes called for in severe cases of bumblefoot. Like other serious infections that are not treated early enough, bumblefoot can be fatal if the animal develops a septic infection. For this reason, early detection and treatment are vital for the best results.</p><h2>How to Prevent Bumblefoot </h2><p>Since bumblefoot can be severe and particularly painful, it's important for owners to prevent their pets from contracting this infection in the first place.</p><h3>Avoid Trauma to the Feet </h3><p>Though the factors that lead to bumblefoot are not always present in every case, prevention of trauma or abrasions to the feet is a cornerstone of prevention. Rat owners should consider covering wire floors in their animal's enclosure with a solid surface such as wood, vinyl, Plexiglass, plastic needlepoint canvas, Vellux blankets, or even towels.</p><p>Flatter surfaces seem to cause less stress on rats' feet, and will likely result in fewer abrasions that may become infected with bacteria. In addition to walking slower, older rats may also be more flat-footed, so care should be taken to ensure senior pets have soft bedding and surfaces to walk on.</p><h3>Clean Enclosures Regularly </h3><p>Keep your rat's cage and bedding meticulously clean and dry. Remove soiled bedding as soon as possible and change it frequently. Using a litter box in your rat's cage can help keep its bedding clean longer, although this method requires patience while rats learn to use it. Sanitize food and water bowls consistently along with planning deep cleans of the enclosure at regular intervals.</p><h3>Keep Pet Rats Healthy </h3><p>Prevent your rats from becoming overweight by providing a healthy diet and plenty of opportunities for exercise. Rats' diets should consist of rat block or pellets. To prevent excessive weight gain, try to limit treats (although the occasional supplement is fine). If your rat begins gaining too much weight, consult your small pet veterinarian about dietary options that can help.</p><h3>Check for Injuries Regularly </h3><p>Check your rats' feet for abrasions, trauma, or early signs of bumblefoot. This will allow you to detect and treat any wounds early, preventing the painful abscesses and bumps associated with this infection. It may also alert you to potential problems in your rats' cage or bedding, allowing you to correct these issues early and prevent further injuries in the future.</p>",1134
14,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hermit-crab-housing-1236872,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>How to Set up a Sand Tank for Pet Hermit Crab</h1>,"<h1>How to Set up a Sand Tank for Pet Hermit Crab</h1><p>Hermit crabs don't need an elaborate home, but the appropriate temperature and humidity are vital to their health. Land hermit crabs, the most common type of pet, come from warm tropical climates and, therefore, need a warm, humid environment to survive.</p><h2>Picking the Tank </h2><p>Hermit crabs will feel at home in either a glass or plastic tank. Choose a 10-gallon aquarium with a lid. A sliding glass one will work well to contain humidity. The small plastic homes with accessories sold as hermit crab kits are too small, though these plastic cages make excellent temporary homes or isolation tanks. Despite their name, hermits are quite social and are best kept in groups.</p><h2>The Substrate </h2><p>Sand is the substrate of choice for hermit crabs because they like to burrow down into it. Playground sand, which can be found at home improvement stores, works well and is inexpensive, though aquarium sand is fine as well. You may want to rinse, dry, and bake the sand (at 300 degrees Fahrenheit) to sterilize it, and it can be rewashed and used again. Calcium-based sands are nice and comein a wide array of colors but are expensive.</p><p>Other options include fiber bedding made for reptiles such as the coconut fiber-based bedding called Forest Bedding. The fiber is ground quite fine and is nearly like soil, so it is good for burrowing. Crushed coral is also a nice choice, but you may want to provide an area with Forest Bedding or sand as your hermit crabs may prefer these substrates for molting. Avoid the use of gravel or wood shavings.</p><h2>Maintaining Proper Temperature </h2><p>Hermit crabs are happiest kept at 72 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (22 to 27 degrees Celsius). If the temperature drops below 72 degrees Fahrenheit regularly, the crabs will likely become weak, stressed, and ill. Unless you live in a tropical climate, you will need to use a heater at least part of the time to keep the crab tank at optimal temperatures. Undertank heaters (UTHs), lights, or a combination of both can be used to maintain appropriate temperatures.</p><p>The UTHs can be placedunderone end of the tank to provide a warm side and a cooler side. These will raise the temperature a few degrees above room temperature. For ideal temperature control, these can be combined with a thermostat to maintain a given temperature, or you can put them on a timer to come on and off to maintain temperatures. Invest in a good thermometer for inside the tank, and monitor the temperature near the substrate. If the heater isn't heating the tank enough, try removing some of the substrates over the heater the thinner substrate will increase the heat in the tank. If the tank is getting too warm, you can increase the depth of the substrate. Some experimentation may be necessary to get good, stable temperatures. Make sure that there is atemperature gradientin the tank, so the crabs have a choice of temperatures.</p><p>Lights of various types can also provide heat for the tank; some experimentation with lighting may also be necessary to find the combination of lights and UTH that works best for your tank.</p><h2>Lights </h2><p>In the past, it was thought that hermit crabs were nocturnal and that providing lights could be stressful for the crabs. However, low-wattage and special night light bulbs are a good option, and many crab owners have found their crabs became more active with lighting and even bask near the lights when the lighting was added to the tank. Be sure to provide a light-dark cycle, such as 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. This means day-glow or fluorescent bulbs should only be off at night, though special nighttime bulbs can be used if desired. Using a desk lampto heat the tank, or high-wattage reptile bulbs, may overheat the tank and be too drying, so these are not recommended.</p><p>The easiest way to add lighting is to use a reptile heating/lighting hood over the tank. Hoods can be found with two ceramic receptacles for incandescent bulbs; a day-glow bulb can be putonone side and a night glow bulb on the other. It is best to start with15-wattbulbs and go to higher wattages only if necessary, especially with a10-gallontank. If necessary, wood slats can be used to raise the hood a bit above the glass if it gets too hot. Some hoods have a third receptacle for a fluorescent bulb, and some owners have reported good results with a Reptisun 2.0 fluorescent. Reptile heat hoods are best used on glass top tanks or screens, though screen tops make humidity regulation difficult, as the lights will be quite warm and could melt the plastic. A combination of lighting andundertankheat can be used to heat the tank.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Along with the proper temperature, adequate humidity in the tank is vitally important to hermit crabs. Because crabs ""breathe"" via gills, the proper exchange of oxygen by the crabs depends on the humidity in the air. If the tank air is too dry, the crabs will essentially suffocate. They need arelative humidityof around 70 to 80 percent. Because this is so important to the crabs, it is worth investing in a humidity meter, known as a hygrometer, which you can find in the reptile section of the pet store. Excess humidity is not desirable either as it will cause condensation as well as encourage the growth of bacteria and fungus in the tank.</p><p>The water dish you provide in the tank will likely be sufficient for creating the proper humidity, as long as the tank is enclosed with solid sides and top. If you need to increase the humidity level, try a fairly large chunk of a natural sea sponge in a dish of water (remember to always use dechlorinated water). The sponge can hold lots of water and has lots of surfaces for evaporation to boost the humidity. Have a couple of sponges on hand so you can swap and clean them frequently (soak them in very hotdechlorinatedwater or a sea salt/water mix, then allow them to dry completely as they are a good medium for bacterial growth). If a mesh or vented lid is makinghumidity controldifficult, the lid can be modified by covering most of the top with plastic wrap or clear packing tape.</p><h2>Cage Furnishings </h2><p>There are three necessities for furnishing the cage: stuff to climb on, a water bowl, and a food dish.</p><p>The best paint to use around hermit crabs is acrylic paint just make sure to keep it away from the inside of their shells.</p><p>After using a good layer of sand as substrate, small river pebbles are great for hermit crabs.</p><p>Hermit crabs can co-exist with other hermit crabs and freshwater crabs. In fact, hermit crabs do not do well as solitary creatures, so keeping them with at least a few other hermit crabs is preferred.</p><p>A number of things can make your hermit crab's home stinky: infrequent cleanings (which leave molted exoskeletons hanging around), waste, and old food. Hermit crabs also release pheromones with an unpleasant aroma when they are stressed: this can happen when their habitat is unclean, if they are handled too much, or are lonely.</p>",1192
15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbits-as-pets-1237195,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>How to Litter Train a Rabbit</h1>,"<h1>How to Litter Train a Rabbit</h1><p>Rabbits usually take well to litter training, although some flexibility may be required by the owner. Rabbits naturally pick one or more toilet areas, and owners can take advantage of this in litter training.</p><h2>What Kind of Litter Should I Use? </h2><p>First, a suitable litter is needed. Your rabbit will probably like to lay in the litter box and may even nibble on the litter, so something absorbent and safe is necessary. Rabbit urine also has a strong odor, so something that absorbs odor is ideal. Do not use clay or clumping litters, or cedar or pine wood shavings.</p><p>Organic or paper-based pellets and litters are a good choice (brands include Critter Country, Eco-Straw Pellets, Gentle Touch, Cell-Sorb Plus and Yesterday's News). Some owners simply use rabbit pellets as litter while others will layer hay on top of paper-based bedding in litter boxes to mimic the wild. Rabbit pellets are economical and safe but are not a good choice if your rabbit continually eats extra pellets from the litter box that are soaked in urine and/or is overweight.</p><h2>What Kind of Box Should I Use? </h2><p>For litter pans, cat litter boxes work pretty well, although smaller pans such as cake pans may work for smaller rabbits. If your rabbit tends to back right up to the edge and deposit outside the box, some creativity may be required. A covered cat box is a good option or a dishpan that has higher sides can work as well (a lower entry can be cut into one side). The larger size of corner litter boxes might work well for smaller rabbits too, as these usually have fairly high backs.</p><p>If your rabbit tends to tip the pan or kick the litter out, try a heavier litter.</p><h2>How to Litter Train a Rabbit </h2><h3>Keep Your Rabbit in Its Cage to Begin </h3><p>To start, confinement and supervision is the key. If a rabbit is allowed to urinate and defecate wherever it likes from the beginning, it will be much harder to train. At first, keep your rabbit primarily in his (or her cage), which should be fairly small at first, with a litter pan. Place a litter box in the cage, and note where you rabbit eliminates. He (she) may start using the box or may pick another corner of the cage as a toilet. If this is the case, then move the litter box to the area your rabbit seems to prefer. Flexibility on litter box placement may be necessary both in and out of the cage. Most rabbits will urinate/defecate in the area where the eat as well so keep that in mind for location purposes!</p><h3>Allow Supervised Time Out of the Cage </h3><p>Once your rabbit is using the litter pan in the cage, allow the rabbit out of the cage in a limited area. Place feces from its cage into the litter box to help your rabbit know where to use the bathroom based on scent. Provide a litter box within this area, and perhaps make it enticing by placing a treat or favorite toy in the box. Watch your rabbit for signs he is about to urinate or defecate (they usually back up and lift their tail slightly), and try to herd him to the box immediately. If your rabbit is very calm about being picked up, it should be okay to place him right in the box. If your rabbit uses the box, give the rabbit a treat (food, toy, petting, or praise) right away. If you notice your rabbit tends to head to one area to do its business, consider putting the box here.</p><h3>Avoid Punishing Your Rabbit for Accidents </h3><p>Accidents will happen, and punishment has no place in training a rabbit. Your rabbit will absolutely not be able to make a connection with physical punishment and eliminating outside the litter box. If you catch your rabbit in the act, calmly and gently take him or her to the litter box immediately. But, if you don't physically catch your rabbit urinating or defecating, it is too late for your rabbit to make the connection. Just clean up and watch your rabbit a little more closely next time (clean the spot diluted vinegar, or a commercial pet stain/odor remover). The key is to get your rabbit to the box before he goes, so a trip to the litter box every 10 minutes during playtime can be helpful.</p><h3>Grant More Time Outside the Cage </h3><p>Over time, your rabbit will probably develop a preference for using the box, and the amount of freedom you give your rabbit can be increased. You may need to provide more boxes as you allow your rabbit access to more space (rabbits may not go far in search of a box so have them handy). Again, if your rabbit repeatedly chooses one place in the room to eliminate, consider putting or moving a litter box there. Try to work with what your rabbit naturally wants to do, but if the location they ""choose"" is inconvenient, you can try putting a litter box there for a while and then gradually move it to a better spot. Sometimes, placing a bowl of food where you don't want them to go works too.</p><h3>Follow the Rabbit's Lead </h3><p>The process sounds daunting and time consuming but usually goes pretty smoothly as long as the owner works with the rabbit's natural tendencies and provides undivided attention to the rabbit during its free time in the beginning. Establishing a routine with your rabbit will also help. Sometimes a previously trained rabbit will get a little careless, and this usually means backtracking and restricting freedom until your rabbit is trained again.</p><p>Older rabbits are usually easier to train than young bunnies, as they do not need to eliminate as frequently and their natural desire for cleanliness is more developed. However, once rabbits hit puberty the desire to mark territory becomes very strong, and even previously well-trained rabbits may start urine marking and spraying as well as defecating to mark its territory.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Marking behavior will often result from a variety of stresses along with the natural instinct to stake out a territory. Urine marking does not always take the form of spraying, and both males and females mark, although it is far more common with intact males (not neutered).</p><h2>Why Rabbits Mark Their Territory </h2><p>Sometimes territorial marking is a temporary situation and may occur in response to some sort of stress, change in routine, change in the household, or addition of another pet (particularly another rabbit). Often, once the rabbit no longer feels stressed or is confident his territory is secure, he (or she) will stop marking.</p><p>With all that said, rabbits are prone to health problems with their urinary tract, so if there is a sudden persistent change in urination habits or the color and amount of urine, a trip to a veterinarian is in order. This is especially true if your rabbit starts vocalizing while urinating, urinating blood, or urinating small amounts frequently (most rabbits urinate infrequently and in large volumes).</p>",1170

There are 24 hamster species, however, five are the most commonly kept as pets. Some hamster species make perfect solo pets, while others are comfortable living in a group. If you're looking for a hamster to hold and interact with, some breeds are better suited for handling while others prefer to play on their own.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>You can bond with a hamster over time. Be patient, don't force handling right away, feed on a regular schedule, provide out-of-habitat playtime, and talk softly with your new furry friend. A hamster will likely come to recognize your scent and voice and see you as a source of comfort eventually.</p><h3>Species Characteristics </h3><p>Pet hamsters range from 2 to 7 inches long and have short tails; small eyes; and fur in black, brown, gray, white, yellow, or red. They collect and carry food in large cheek pouches. They have wide feet with four toes in the front and five toes in back. Hamsters have large, chisel-shaped front teeth that grow throughout their lives. Larger hamsters prefer to live alone; for example, male Syrian hamsters put together will likely fight for dominance and attempt to kill each other. Dwarf hamsters of the same sex seem to be able to live together peacefully. Hamsters are usually docile with humans and rarely bite. All hamsters are nocturnal, sleeping during the day and becoming active at night.</p><p>These five hamster breeds tend to make great family pets.</p><h2>Dwarf Roborovski</h2><p>The smallest of the popular hamster breeds, the Roborovski dwarf hamster ( ) matures to just 2 inches long. On average, these hamsters live about three years. Because this breed is so tiny, it is best to use an aquarium with a mesh lid to house these hamsters. They can easily escape through the spacing in wire cages. The Roborovski is a quick-moving hamster. It is an agile breed and loves to be active. Be sure to provide this hamster with plenty of toys and activities.</p><p>These hamsters can be handled but are happiest left alone. Their tiny size and agile nature mean that they can easily wriggle out of your grasp and get lost. They can be social and do well in same-sex groups as long as they are properly introduced. If you would like to own multiple hamsters, the dwarf Roborovski is a great choice.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 2 to 3 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.7 to 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Sandy brown fur with white bellies and white markings around their eyes</p><h2>Campbell's Dwarf Russian</h2><p></p><p>The Campbell's dwarf Russian hamster () grows to a maximum of 4 inches and has an average life expectancy of two years. This is another social breed that can be kept in same-sex groups as long as the hamsters are properly introduced. The Campbell's dwarf Russian hamster is a quick little animal and may be prone to nip if they feel threatened or frightened. They are friendly hamsters and do not mind being held if it's done properly. Though nocturnal, these hamsters may wake for short periods throughout the day.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 2 to 4 inches</p><p>Weight: 1.5 to 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Grayish-brown body fur, white belly fur, and a darker stripe down their backs with furry feet</p><h2>Syrian (Golden) Hamster</h2><p></p><p>Also known as golden or teddy bear hamsters, the Syrian hamster ( ) is the most popular pet hamster, especially for children. They range from from 5 to 9 inches in length and have a lifespan of two to four years. Through selective breeding, you can find this hamster in a wide range of colors and coat lengths, though typically they are golden-brown and white.</p><p>The Syrian hamster is the best species for handling. It is easy to tame, the slowest of the popular pet hamsters, and the least likely to bite. Though docile with humans, they are territorial with other hamsters and should always be housed alone. They will fight if housed in groups. The Syrian is true to its nocturnal nature and is rarely active during the day. Early morning or late evening are the best times to interact with this hamster.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Golden brown with a lighter belly, although several variations in color, pattern, and hair length exist</p><h2>Dwarf Winter White Russian</h2><p><p>The dwarf winter white Russian ( ) is similar to the Campbell's dwarf Russian hamster. They are typically 3.5 to 4 inches long and live about two years. They are rounder and have shorter faces than the Campbell's. Its fur can turn white in winter. The dwarf winter white Russian is very docile and is less likely to bite than many other hamster species. They are quick and agile and may be difficult to handle for children.</p><p>You can keep this hamster breed in same-sex pairs or groups as long as they are properly introduced at a young age. However, even hamsters raised together can turn territorial and may need to be separated when older. It would be best if you housed this small breed in an aquarium tank with a mesh lid; it could slip through a regular wire cage spacing.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 2.7 to 3.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.7 to 1.6 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Round bodies, short faces; dark gray fur, white bellies, and a black stripe down their backs; fur can turn white in winter</p><h2>Chinese Hamster</h2><p>The Chinese hamster ( ) can get up to five inches long. They can live up to three years. This species is known for being friendly and comfortable with handling if they are consistently tamed and handled from a young age. If they are not accustomed to being handled, they can be timid and nervous, which can lead to nipping. They are tiny and quick and can easily squirm out of your hands. Always be cautious when handling a hamster and be aware of how high you are holding them. Stay close to the ground to avoid high falls. The Chinese hamster is another friendly species that can be kept in same-sex groups or pairs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 3.2 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1.1 to 1.6 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Brown fur with a black stripe down their back and lighter colored fur on its underside; has longer tails than most hamsters</p><h2>Hamsters to Avoid </h2><p>Avoid all hamsters if you already have cats or terrier dogs that have an overly-keen interest in small furries, or you have a noisy household with young children that may struggle to gently handle these fragile pets. Also, if you have an active home during the day, you will need to find a dedicated space for the hamster to sleep soundly during the day. If you can't find a quiet spot, you might want to pass on hamsters and consider a diurnal degu or guinea pig instead.</p><p>If you want to handle your hamster, then avoid the three dwarf species. They are quicker, more agile, and quite slippery most likely to escape and suffer an injury from a fall from your hands.</p><p>There are 24 hamster species.</p><p>Identifying a hamster's breed is all about the markings and the size of the animal.</p><p>The world's rarest hamster is the European hamster, which could be extinct within 30 years.</p>",1186
17,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinese-water-dragons-1239191,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>How to Care for a Chinese Water Dragon</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Chinese Water Dragon</h1><h2>These exotic lizards have very specific care needs</h2><p>Chinese water dragons are a breed of lizard that is native to southern China and Southeast Asia, with some types native to Australia. They are typically known for their friendly disposition and habits like standing on their back feet, bobbing their heads, and skilled climbing.</p><p>Chinese water dragons range from a dark to light green. They have vertical, slanted stripes of green or turquoise on their bodies. Their bellies are white or pale yellow, and their throats are a blend of yellow, orange, and peach. The long tail is narrow and banded with green and brown. Adult males have larger heads than females, and they develop larger crests on the back of the head and neck.</p><p>They may be popular pet reptiles due to their smaller size, but their care requirements are very intense than most people anticipate.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Chinese Water Dragon Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These lizards are one of the most friendly types. Typically, they do enjoy being handled. Regular handling is essential to prevent them from becoming too aggressive.</p><p>If the Chinese water dragon is scared or feels threatened, it may bite or whip its tail. They are pretty active in their environment and like to climb on rocks, up trees, on branches, or in plants. They are also good swimmers and are happy when there is water in their enclosure as well. Chinese water dragons are social animals. They tend to thrive in captivity when in pairs or groups. This is recommended, especially since owning more than one Chinese water dragon doesn't require much more work (or expense).</p><h3>What is Chinese Water Dragon?</h3><p>Chinese Water Dragons are a curious species of lizard that, when scared, hide in the water. They can stay underneath for nearly half an hour, are bright green, with a banded tail, and usually grow to be 3 feet tall.</p><h2>Housing the Chinese Water Dragon </h2><p>Water dragons need large enclosures, and the minimum size for an adult dragon is 5 or 6 feet long, 2 or 3 feet deep, and 5 or 6 feet tall. An enclosure of this size will likely need to be custom made and is going to be costly.</p><p>Unless you know your dragons are accurately sexed, you may be better off with just one, although it may be lonely. A male and female pair will likely get along, while two males and even two females may display aggression unless given lots of space in a very large enclosure. Large fish tanks are often used but are not ideal.</p><p>For substrate in the tank, choose something that won't cause impactions if ingested. Sterilized potting soil (no vermiculite or chemicals) with a cover of sphagnum moss (good for humidity) as well as a mixture of peat, soil, soil, and cypress mulch, indoor/outdoor carpeting, or paper. Plenty of branches should be provided for climbing and basking (place some diagonally and some horizontally for basking). Live plants such as pothos, dracaena, hibiscus, ficus, and staghorn ferns make a good addition.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Within the environment, Chinese water dragons need a good pool of water. It should be large and deep enough that a dragon can submerge at least half its height. A kitty litter box works nicely, but if you can, you should designate half of the enclosure to water and the other half as a beach area (using the substrates to create a shore). You need to be able to remove and clean the water tub daily, especially if your dragon uses it for a toilet. Otherwise, you will need to have a quality water filter. The humidity should be kept at around 80 percent; it's smart to use a digital hydrometer to know the humidity of the enclosure. Mist the enclosure once or twice daily as needed. Potted live plants can help keep the humidity up as well.</p><h2>Heat and Lighting </h2><p>Daytime temperatures should be in the range of 80 to 88 degrees Fahrenheit (26 to 31 degrees Celsius), with a basking spot of 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius). At night, the temperature can safely drop to 75 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 27 degrees Celsius). There should be a temperature gradient, and be sure to measure temperatures on both the cool and warm sides.</p><p>A combination of a basking light, ceramic heat element, under tank heat pads, and heat tape can be used to achieve this gradient. The summertime light cycle for your water dragon should be 12-13 hours, while, in winter, it should be 11-12 hours a day. For your water dragon's bone health, it's important to maintain daily UBV exposure and make sure there nothing in its environment is blocking the light.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>You can feed your Chinese water dragon crickets, mealworms, waxworms, earthworms, grasshoppers, butter worms, locusts, and possibly small feeder fish. Adults can also be fed pinkie miceon occasion, as well as fuzzies. All insect prey should be gut loaded and only fed every two to four weeks and not every day.</p><p>Wild-caught insects are best avoided due to the risk of them containing pesticides, and always avoid fireflies as they are potentially toxic.</p><p>A small amount (10 to 15 percent of the diet) of finely chopped vegetables and fruit can also be offered. Try collards, dandelion, and mustard greens, as well as sweet potato, parsnips, green beans, carrots, and yellow or orange squash. Fruits should be used in smaller quantities than vegetables; try strawberries, raspberries, mangoes, papaya, figs, and cantaloupe.</p><p>Hatchlings and juveniles should be fed every second day, while, as a general rule, adults can be fed two to three times per week. The best way to determine how much to feed is to look at body condition: skinny dragons need more to eat and chubby dragons need to be fed less. Offer a single whole-prey item every two to four weeks.</p><p>Use a calcium/vitamin D3 supplement on the food at every other feeding along with a complete vitamin/mineral supplement once a week. Do not give the calcium on the same day do feed the multivitamin.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2> <p>Note that good husbandry the care and keeping of your Chinese water dragon is key to keeping it healthy. </p><h2>Choosing Your Chinese Water Dragon </h2><p>Buy your pet from a reputable breeder or pet store. Captive-bred Chinese water dragons will adapt better to captivity than wild-caught. Additionally, wild-caught water dragons are usually rife with internal and external parasites.</p>",1111
18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-behavior-4025353,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Understanding Rabbit Behavior and Body Language</h1>,"<h1>Understanding Rabbit Behavior and Body Language</h1><h2>What Different Rabbit Behaviors Mean</h2><p>Pet rabbits have bigger personalities than most people give them credit for. People who have never had a pet rabbit may not understand that each rabbit has its own unique personality. All rabbits do things to communicate that they are happy, sad, or scared and while every rabbit is different, certain behaviors mean the same thing for most rabbits.</p><h2>Rabbit Binkying </h2><p>Rabbits binkying look a bit like a person gleefully jumping into the air and clicking their heels together. While rabbits don't actually do that Fred Astaire heel click, they do leap into the air and twist their bodies to show that they are happy or excited. Someone who doesn't know what a binky looks like may think that their rabbit is scared and running away or that something else is wrong with them but a binky is a very normal, natural thing for a happy rabbit to do. All rabbit owners should have bunnies happy enough to binky.</p><h2>Rabbit Digging</h2><p>Rabbits are natural diggers. Their wild cousins dig burrows for nesting and to make their homes and our house rabbits dig for fun. This is an instinctual behavior but it can be bothersome and destructive for their humans that love them. Rabbits will also dig on your feet or hands to get your attention. Digging is normal!</p><h2>The Bunny 500 </h2><p>If your rabbit has ever run around the room as fast as they can as though something is chasing them then you've witnessed the bunny 500. This behavior is a happy one and your bunny is zooming around out of pure excitement. Perhaps they are playing with you or a furry friend or are expecting a favorite treat. Regardless of the reason, the bunny 500 is not only entertaining to watch but you can rest assured knowing that this means your rabbit is one happy bunny.</p><h2>Rabbit Flopping </h2><p>Some people get nervous when they see their rabbits flop over onto their sides but this flopping is a sign of a content rabbit. Usually, your rabbit will be resting, sitting up, and then roll onto its side to lie down. This flopping motion is much different than a seizure because your rabbit will be very relaxed, their eyes will most likely be closed and their legs will not be moving. Flopping is a normal rabbit behavior and it means your rabbit is relaxed.</p><h2>Rabbit Noises </h2><p>Rabbits are social and while most people who have never owned a rabbit have never heard a rabbit make a noise you can rest assured that they have their own vocabulary to tell us and each other how they feel. Some noises are very obvious such as screaming. A rabbit will only scream if they are scared, stressed, or frightened. You will hopefully never hear a rabbit scream.</p><p>Other less alarming noises include a buzz or honk noise, which can mean they are excited and is usually done while they are circling and sniffing another rabbit, and teeth grinding. Teeth grinding can mean your rabbit is uncomfortable or in pain but it can also mean they are content. If the teeth grinding (also referred to as purring) is heard while your rabbit is sitting up, hunched, and not moving then it most likely signifies they are in pain. If it is heard very softly while your rabbit is relaxed, such as after flopping, then it means they are relaxed.</p><p>Growling is another noise that you may hear if you have a territorial rabbit or if they are angry or stressed out. Neutering or spaying your rabbit will help to relieve any territorial tendencies but you may still hear growling if you are trying to introduce a new rabbit to your bunny. If you hear growling you should separate the rabbits because a growl is an indication that a fight or other type of aggressive behavior may occur.</p><h2>Rabbit Kicking </h2><p>Rabbits can deliver a very strong kick if they want to. They have powerful hind legs and if they are displeased they may kick to try to get away or indicate they want to be put down if they are being held. If your rabbit appears to kick as they hop away from you they are trying to kick up dirt to show they are upset. If a rabbit is kicking while you are holding them then you should carefully set them down because they can hurt or paralyze their back if they kick hard enough while being held.</p><h2>Rabbit Nose Bonking and Nudging </h2><p>If your bunny is nudging his nose on its toys or on you it is because this is their way of exploring and investigating things. Just like sharks bonk and nudge to get an idea of what it is they are looking at, rabbits have very sensitive little noses that help them discover what makes up their environments. Sometimes a bonk or nudge is followed by a nip to further test it out or to indicate that the rabbit wants you to move or pay attention to you.</p><h2>Biting Rabbits </h2><p>Rabbits may give you an innocent nip to get your attention but they can also bite to show dominance, out of fear, or to say they don't like something/someone. Rabbits may bite each other if they are fighting or if an established rabbit doesn't like a new rabbit, out of sexual frustration or to establish a hierarchy with the other rabbits they live with, or simply because they don't want to do something if you are trying to pick them up or put them in a cage. Rabbits aren't usually aggressive and neutering or spaying can help resolve any aggressive tendencies.</p><h2>Thumping Rabbits </h2><p>A rabbit that thumps their hind leg is an upset rabbit. Thumping is a sign that is meant to warn other rabbits that there is something in the area to avoid. Thumping can mean danger is near or that they are mad or feel threatened.</p><h2>Licking Rabbits </h2><p>Rabbit tongues are just the cutest and the little licks that rabbits give are no different. They may not be kissers like dogs but they are often seen grooming themselves or their rabbit friends with their cute little pink tongues. This is very normal behavior but if a rabbit ingests too much hair it can cause a problem. Be sure to help your rabbit with their grooming regimen by regularly combing or brushing them.</p><h2>Rabbit Chinning </h2><p>Rabbits have scent glands on their face like many other animals. Sometimes rabbits will rub their chin on something (referred to as chinning) to tell other rabbits that the object is theirs. This is a normal way of marking their territory.</p>",1112
19,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-snail-considerations-5114912,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>What to Consider Before Keeping a Pet Snail</h1>,"<h1>What to Consider Before Keeping a Pet Snail</h1><p>Snails can make great pets. They don't need to be walked, they don't shed or smell, they make no noise, they don't require a lot of space, and it's rather relaxing to watch them glide serenely along their terrarium.</p><p>Most often, the brown garden snails (is the variety kept as a pet. While very common and destructive in the garden, this species of terrestrial mollusk is actually European in origin, and is considered an invasive species in many areas of the world, including North America. You'll find on the menu in many French restaurants as escargot, but don't eat a snail found wild in your garden; the snail could have eaten a poisoned bait or be infected with parasites.</p><p>Like any pet, your snail needs an appropriate diet, home no, that shell on its back isn't the only house it needs and care schedule. Before grabbing the nearest snail out of your garden, here are some things you should consider before bringing one home as a pet.</p><h2>1. Snails and Your Schedule </h2><p>Snails are nocturnal or crepuscular creatures (meaning most active at dusk and dawn), so they may be most active when you are going to bed, waking up, or already sleeping. If you plan to watch your snail's activities during the day and handle it while it is awake, then you better be a night owl. Be prepared to wait until later in the day to feed your snail and enjoy its slow-paced life. You can encourage your snail to be more active by keeping the room lights dim and gently misting its habitat, however.</p><h2>2. Children and Snails </h2><p>Some children may love having a unique pet like a snail, while others would prefer a more traditional pet like a guinea pig. Snails move very differently than other animals, so they can be interesting to watch as they glide along on their muscular foot, leaving behind a shimmering trail of slime. Many children enjoy watching a snail effortlessly slide up the walls of its terrarium, or even glide upside-down along the lid. Plus, there's a certain fascination and even cuteness to observing a snail's bobbing eye stalks.</p><p>Snails don't have to have human interaction to thrive, so if you have a child that is interested in nature, a snail could be an easy pet. On the other hand, if you have a child that would prefer a pet to cuddle, a snail may not be the best option. It's best to limit snail-keeping to children old enough to understand that snails are delicate and cannot be dropped or treated roughly.</p><h2>3. Handling Snails </h2><p>Snails are generally safe to handle, but there are a few things you should do to make sure you don't cause them any harm.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Never pick up a snail by its shell, as this can damage the muscle that attaches the body to the shell. If this muscle, called the mantle, is damaged, death can result.</p><h2>4. Zoonotic Concerns with Snails </h2><p>Snails can harbor parasites that can potentially infect people, especially if the snail is wild-caught. Because of this, you should not only wash your hands before handling a snail to keep them safe, but also afterwards to protect yourself. You should never kiss your snail or allow children to put them in their mouth. Be sure that your children understand that they need to wash their hands thoroughly after touching their pet snail.</p><h2>5. Space for a Snail </h2><p>Snails do not take up much space. A small plastic or glass terrarium makes an ideal home. The tank should have a tight-fitting lid so the snail cannot escape, but be sure that the cover is mesh or a similar material that allows plenty of fresh air to reach the snails inside.</p><p>You can use clean potting soil as a substrate for your snails. A bit of sphagnum moss on top gives your snails somewhere to hide during the day. Mist your snails with clean water daily to keep them moist, but don't let the tank get soggy or waterlogged.</p><p>You can add some decorations to the tank if you'd like; fish tank decor works well for this purpose. It's not necessary to decorate a snail tank, but can be more fun for your children, and even for you. Watching a snail glide into a little ""Sponge Bob"" house or a pirate ship can be lots of fun.</p><h2>6. Feeding Your Snail </h2><p>Snails are herbivores, meaning they eat plant materials. You can feed your pet fresh dandelion greens, lettuce and other leafy greens, bits of cucumber or broccoli, and carrots. They also enjoy small pieces of strawberries, apples, and other fruits.</p><p>Your snail also needs a source of calcium to keep its shell healthy. You can provide this by placing a small cuttlebone into the terrarium these are sold in the bird section of pet stores or by sprinkling finely ground eggshells onto its food.</p><p>Feed your snail once a day. Remember that it won't need a large amount of food, and you don't want to leave food spoiling in the terrarium, so only provide a small amount of food at a time and remove any uneaten food the next day.</p><p>Your snail will get enough water from its food and from your daily misting with water, so you do not need to put a water dish into the tank.</p><h2>7. Time Requirements to Care for a Snail </h2><p>Snails will need fresh produce daily and an occasional change of their substrate. Aside from that, snails can be left to their own devices. They do not require attention or handling, so there is no need to make sure they receive a certain amount of exercise each day. The largest amount of time will be dedicated to purchasing and washing your snail's fresh fruits and vegetables. But you will probably enjoy spending at least a few minutes each day observing your pets.</p><h2>8. Snail Life Span </h2><p>Snail life spans can vary, but in captivity it is possible for your snail to live to be a teenager, although most brown garden snails live for just a few years. Keep in mind though, if you find a garden snail and decide to care for it as a pet, there is no way to know how old it is.</p>",1113
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/seizures-in-pet-rabbits-1239352,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Seizures in Rabbits</h1>,"<h1>Seizures in Rabbits</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Like humans and other pets, rabbits can have seizures periods of involuntary physical movement usually accompanied by some kind of mental aberration. In some cases, loss of consciousness can also occur. Seizure episodes can be scary, especially if you've never seen a rabbit or any other pet have one. While many rabbits recover fully from seizures, some do have lasting symptoms. Seizures may either be caused by less severe issues (like injury or ear infections) or symptoms of other rabbit diseases that can be fatal. Medications may be available for the management of seizures, but treatment and recovery are largely dependent on the cause of the episodes.</p><h2>What Are Seizures? </h2><p>Seizures in rabbits are a neurological condition that causes sudden uncontrolled movements, unusual behaviors, and even loss of consciousness. These episodes in both humans and animals are caused by sudden electrical activity in the brain which can have many different causes, including other underlying diseases.</p><p>A seizure does not always involve convulsions, shaking, or twitching, but those behaviors are associated with generalized seizures (also called grand mal, the most easily recognizable type). Less severe seizures may go unnoticed by owners because their symptoms can be minimal. If you've noticed any unusual behaviors, especially those including movements of the body, it's best to take your rabbit to an exotic veterinarian who can discuss the signs and perform any necessary testing.</p><h2>Symptoms of Seizures in Rabbits </h2><p>The symptoms of seizures can vary widely from mild signs to noticeable behaviors. You may see your rabbit making abnormal movements like rolling, twitching, tilting its head, or being unable to move certain body parts. Grand mal seizures also cause loss of consciousness while experiencing involuntary tremors.</p><p>Focal seizures are not as concerning as grand mal seizures, and the length of the seizure is important to note. A seizure lasting several minutes will increase your rabbit's body temperature and can cause permanent brain damage, while a mild, short seizure will most likely not leave any lasting effects. If seizures last for at least five minutes or happen more than once in a day, experts recommend seeing a veterinarian immediately. In these cases, your pet should see an emergency veterinarian if your usual exotics veterinarian is unavailable.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Generalized (Grand Mal) Seizures </h3><p>Generalized seizures are the type that is most commonly associated with these episodes. During generalized seizures, pets lose consciousness and experience full-body tremors. Vocalization is also common, though it is believed that like humans, animals do not experience pain during these episodes. Involuntary movements are a characteristic sign of grand mal seizures, which can include rolling, waving or ""paddling"" of the legs, tilting the head, and twitching.</p><p>Your rabbit may appear distressed throughout the episode. After the seizure, your rabbit may seem confused and disoriented until it fully regains consciousness and the ability to move normally.</p><h3>Focal Seizures </h3><p>During focal seizures, your rabbit may lose function in one leg. Twitching is still present, but it may be limited to small movements of the ears rather than full-body tremors. Focal seizures can also involve ""bubblegum chewing"" where the rabbit licks and chomps at the air (similar to chewing bubblegum or eating peanut butter).</p><p>Treatment options for both grand mal seizures and focal seizures will be dependent upon the episode's cause.</p><h2>Causes of Seizures </h2><p>There are several possible causes of seizures in rabbits. Some are minor or passing issues, while other reasons are serious and even potentially fatal.</p><p>Rabbits that are at greater risk of seizures may have underlying cardiac, kidney, or liver disease, brain injury, or a neurological disorder. For this reason, it's important to visit your veterinarian when your pet experiences any unusual symptoms so they can properly diagnose any issues before they progress.</p><h2>Diagnosing Seizures in Rabbits </h2><p>A neurological examination by your exotics veterinarian will help determine the cause of the seizure. Your vet may recommend specific tests to rule out some common reasons behind seizures including ear cytology or cultures, MRI or CT scans, radiographs (X-rays), testing, orblood chemistry screening. There is, however, no ""seizure test"" that can determine the cause with certainty. If the tests come back inconclusive or diagnostics are not financially affordable for you, a variety of medications may be tried before starting your rabbit on a long-term seizure control prescription.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If you are present when your rabbit has a seizure, stay calm and hold your rabbit firmly but gently so that it doesnot flail or fall, which may cause other injuries. Next, look at the clock to see what time it is; most seizures last less than a minute. If your rabbit continues to have convulsions for more than a couple of minutes, take it to the closest vet for emergency treatment while you cool it down using a wet towel.</p><p>Most of the time, your rabbit will come out of the seizure after less than a minute of convulsing. It is important to remain calm and talk quietly to comfort your rabbit while it comes out of a seizure. After your rabbit is calm and sitting up normally, mark the event on the calendar so that you can track the frequency of any future seizures.</p><p>If your rabbit has a seizure for the first time, contact your exotics veterinarianto discuss the situation. A consultation may be recommended. If the frequency of seizures increases over time or if your rabbit has another seizure within 24 hours, visit the vet as soon as possible.</p><p>Your veterinarian may try a variety of medications to treat some common causes of seizures. Antibiotics, steroids, anti-parasitics, anti-inflammatories, and even seizure control medications may be used if the definitive reason for the episodes is not found.Phenobarbital is one commonly used seizure control medication that your exotics vet may prescribe.</p><h2>Prognosis for Rabbits With Seizures </h2><p>Because there are many different causes behind seizures in rabbits, the prognosis for your pet can vary considerably. Some less severe seizures may only happen once, or they may be able to be limited in the future with proper medication. In the case of inner ear infections or injury, your veterinarian can typically provide treatment for the underlying cause. After the necessary testing and examinations are performed, a veterinarian can help you determine the best treatment option for your specific rabbit based on their findings.</p><h2>How to Prevent Seizures </h2><p>Seizures occur unexpectedly, and often as a result of unknown causes. Prevention, therefore, involves proper medication and care following any previous episodes. Regular checkups can help your veterinarian identify possible issues that can contribute to seizures. Keeping up with your rabbit's vaccination schedule can help keep other conditions at bay that may contribute to neurological issues.</p>",1103

If your pet rabbit seems excessively itchy and scratches a lot, it has a problem that needs to be addressed. Various issues from mites to allergies can cause a rabbit to itch and scratch, but fortunately, these are treatable.</p><h2>Why Do Rabbits Itch and Scratch? </h2><p>When an animal experiences severe itching and scratching, it's called . In a rabbit, it can be due to fur, skin, or ear parasites; dry skin; allergies; or infections. No matter the cause, it's important to take care of it right away for the sake of your rabbit's health and peace of mind.</p><h2>Fur Mites </h2><p>are microscopic mites that live in the fur of rabbits. mites are blood-sucking parasites that bite your rabbit in order to feed, which causes it to itch and scratch.</p><p>Fur mites are also referred to as ""walking dandruff,"" because they're often seen moving the dead skin around on rabbits, creating the appearance of mobile skin cells. They may start off in a small area on your rabbit, but if left untreated, they can spread all over its fur, into the environment in which they live, and to other rabbits and pets.</p><p>Even if your rabbit never goes outside, it can get fur mites from food or bedding that you bring into your home.</p><h2>Lice </h2><p>While not as common as some other parasites, lice do infest rabbits. They're species specific, so humans and other nonrabbit pets can't get them.</p><h2>Fleas </h2><p>Many people don't think that rabbits can get fleas, but they can. Fleas, like fur mites, are blood-sucking parasites that bite rabbits, which, in turn, causes them to itch and scratch.</p><p>Female fleas lay up to 50 eggs every day, so even if you only see one or two adult fleas on your rabbit, they've probably already laid hundreds of eggs. Fleas also bite humans, but female fleas usually can't produce viable eggs when human blood is their only food source.</p><p>Indoor rabbits can get fleas just like outdoor rabbits. Other pets in the household can give your rabbit fleas and they can be tracked in from the outdoors. Fleas can also find their own way into homes just like other insects, such as ants.</p><p>A flea comb will help you find fleas and flea dirt. Flea dirt is the cylindrical feces that turn red if rubbed with a wet cotton swab. This is a good trick for distinguishing the digested blood from normal environmental dirt.</p><h2>Dry Skin </h2><p>Your rabbit may develop dry skin, which can make it itch and scratch. Rooms with very low humidity, dusty environments, poor diets, and bathing your rabbit too often or using inappropriate shampoos can all contribute to dry skin in your pet. If you can determine the cause of the dry skin, then you should be able to reverse it. For temporary relief, ask your vet to recommend a rabbit-safe spray product.</p><h2>Ear Mites </h2><p> are ear mites that cause itching and scratching. They can be spread from rabbit to rabbit, so wash your hands after handling a rabbit with itchy ears. You may notice hair loss around the ears and/or scabs, or the rabbit's ears may look especially dirty. A head tilt, flopped ear, and head shaking are also signs of an ear mite infestation, which doesn't always affect both ears. If you notice any of these signs, take your rabbit to see the veterinarian.</p><h2>Allergies </h2><p>Just like people, some rabbits are allergic to certain substances that cause them to itch and scratch. Usually, these allergies are environmental and not food-based, so you can make changes to bedding, litter, cleaning solutions, and air purifiers to make your rabbit more comfortable at home.</p><p>Common environmental allergens include the dust in certain litters or in the rabbit's hay, as well as laundry softeners and detergents used on blankets.</p><p>Rabbits can also be allergic to parasites such as fur mites and fleas. This will make an infestation of these pests even more irritating to your pet.</p><h2>Skin Irritants </h2><p>In addition to allergies, rabbits may be irritated by certain products, especially if they aren't meant for rabbits. Shampoos, conditioners, sprays, and air fresheners may all cause skin irritation in your rabbit. If you use a new product, such as a shampoo, and the next day your rabbit is itching, it may be because it was too harsh for your rabbit's skin. This is often the case with products meant for dogs that are used on rabbits.</p><h2>Ringworm </h2><p>Caused by two main types of organisms (and , ringworm is a fungal infection that causes hair loss, itching, and red ""ringworm"" lesions in rabbits. People can also contract ringworm from a rabbit.</p><p>The main cause of ringworm, as well as mites and fleas, is direct contact with an infected rabbit. When you bring a new rabbit into your home, keep it separate from your other rabbits until you're sure it doesn't have an infection. Rabbits can also contract ringworm from dirty environments and brushes that were used on an infected rabbit.</p><h2>Skin Infections </h2><p>Urine scald and feces that have remained in prolonged contact with your rabbit's skin and generally unclean environments may cause your rabbit to develop a skin infection. The infected area may become red, inflamed, and very itchy and should be treated right away.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The methods used to treat a rabbit's itching and scratching depend on the cause. However, a number of problems are solved through the same means.</p><h2>How to Prevent Itching and Scratching </h2><p>Often, your rabbit's itchiness can be prevented by keeping its environment clean. The freezing recommendation for any rabbit supplies is an excellent place to begin as is the use of fragrance-free laundry products for any washable rabbit bedding.</p><p>Beyond these, be sure that your rabbit's cage is as clean as possible. Daily and weekly upkeep can make a significant difference in the health of your pet and prevent many skin infections. When bathing your rabbit, use only products designed specifically for rabbits.</p><p>It's also a good idea to regularly examine your rabbit's fur. This will help you to easily recognize any abnormalities and take treatment steps immediately, which can prevent an infestation, ear, or skin problem from getting worse.</p><p>At the same time, take precautions for any other pets in your home, using products such as flea preventives on a regular basis. Take care about exposing your rabbit to other animals that could transmit any of these issues as well, especially if it's kept outside or allowed to go outside.</p><p>Parasitic Diseases of Rabbits. .</p><p>Common Mites Of Your Rabbit And Small Animal Part I: Fur Mites.</p>",1099
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pregnancy-in-rabbits-4171961,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Pregnancy in Rabbits</h1>,"<h1>Pregnancy in Rabbits</h1><p>Two common situations may result in having apregnant rabbit:if you recently acquired a pet rabbit from an environment where it was housed with a male rabbit, or if you have both an intact male and an intact female rabbit who spend time together. Either situation could result in welcoming baby rabbits into this world, and you'll need to know what to expect next.</p><h2>Signs Your Rabbit Is Pregnant </h2><p>Rabbits who have not been spayed or neutered are referred to as being intact and once sexually mature, can produce offspring. For smaller breeds, sexual maturity occurs as young as 3.5 months to 4 months of age. If your intact female rabbit was with an intact male rabbit and they are both over the age of 3.5 months, you'll want to monitor your rabbit for signs of pregnancy.</p><p>Like most mammals, a female rabbit's belly will get larger as her babies grow inside throughout the pregnancy, so this is the most obvious sign of a pregnant rabbit. Aside from the weight gain, pregnant rabbits will begin to eat more, and most will also seem extra cranky or moody. If your rabbit is usually pretty unfriendly though, it may be difficult to tell if it's pregnant based solely on a mood swing.</p><p>After about 10-12 days post-breeding,you'll be able to feel multiple marble-sized bumps inside the rabbit's belly. These small bumpsare the baby bunnies and will be just big enough to gently feel at this time. They will continue to grow inside the rabbit for another couple of weeks until the rabbit gives birth about a month after breeding.</p><p>If a pregnant rabbit has reached 30 days after breeding and still has not given birth, your rabbit will need a veterinarian examination. This is to determine if the pregnant female is okay or if she needs an induction of labor or a C-section surgery to remove the babies. The longer the pregnancy goes, especially after 32 days, the higher the risk of the babies not being alive.</p><p>A pregnant rabbit will exhibit nestingbehaviorabout a week before giving birth. The most obvious sign that a rabbit is beginning to nest is if she's piling up bedding or digging into a corner of the enclosure. Usually, a rabbit will take hay or items it can carry in its mouth, or push blankets or loose bedding together to make a comfortable space to give birth.</p><p>A nesting rabbit may alsopull its fur out to line the nest, which can be alarming to owners who don't know to expect this. If your rabbit is nesting, it will most likely give birth within a week, and if your rabbit begins to pull its fur out, anticipate that the babies will be born within the next day or two. Most rabbits give birth at night, so be prepared to wake up to a litter of rabbits.</p><h2>Housing a Pregnant Rabbit </h2><p>In addition to the usual food and water bowls, a pregnant rabbit will need space for its nest and enough room to accommodate all the babies it gives birth to. Rabbits can have up to 15 babies in a litter, so you should be prepared to have space for a lot of rabbits, especially if you don't have homes lined up for them to go to once they are weaned.</p><p>An easy-to-clean nest box option is a cat litter pan filled with hay or bedding. This can be cleaned as needed if your rabbit uses it as a bathroom before the babies are born and also after the babies leave the nest. Some people use other plastic containers with a side cut out of them, so the rabbit can quickly get in and out. While others make wooden boxes, these are not as easy to clean.</p><p>The nest box should be placed within the rabbit's enclosure. A large cageor exercise pen is a good option for housing a pregnant rabbit. These will ensure that the pregnant rabbit uses the nesting box you have provided, and it will make it easier for you to monitor the babies that are born if they are all in this one area.</p><h2>Feeding a Pregnant Rabbit </h2><p>Pregnant and nursing rabbits will consume more food since they are feeding both themselves and their growing babies. Because of this, the number of fresh vegetables that are offered should be increased, and alfalfa hay should be provided at all times. Make a gradual switch from the grass hays that an adult rabbit usually eats to the alfalfa to avoid any soft stools. You can do this by gradually mixing the two hays until you've completely switched over. Freshwater, ideally in a bowl, should also be offered as usual.</p><h2>Care of Baby Rabbits </h2><p>Most baby rabbits will require no assistance from a human. Baby rabbits will nurse from their mothers once or twice a day, for four to five weeks until they are weaned. You can handle newborn baby bunnies if you are concerned about whether or not they are being cared for. Baby bunnies should gain about 1/4 ounce per day if they are being fed appropriately, and a round belly is evidence of a meal if you check on them early in the morning.</p><p>In the unlikely event that you need to intervene and help a domestic baby rabbit, a special formula should be purchased to use for bottle feeding. You should attempt to reintroduce the baby to the mother after a few days of bottle feeding since some new mothers do not have adequate milk production until a few days after giving birth.</p><p>You should attempt to reintroduce the baby (monitor this interaction; she may not accept them back) to the mother after a few days of bottle feeding, since some new mothers do not have adequate milk production until a few days after giving birth.</p><h2>False Rabbit Pregnancy </h2><p>Some rabbits experience a false pregnancy where their body thinks it's pregnant, despite that not being the case. False pregnancywill cause a rabbit to exhibit nesting behavior and act moody. False pregnancy behaviors usually only last about two to three weeks.</p><h2>Preventing Rabbit Pregnancy </h2><p>Aside from keeping an intact female rabbit completely separate from an intact male rabbit at all times, the best way to prevent a rabbit from becoming pregnant is to spay it. Spaying a rabbit will remove the uterus and ovaries that a rabbit needs to have babies, as well as eliminate or decrease the chances of it developing several types of cancers later in life. Surgery to spay a rabbit does not happen without risks of course, but you should discuss this with your veterinarian.</p>",1099
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-eye-problems-1239333,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Eye Problems in Rabbits</h1>,"<h1>Eye Problems in Rabbits</h1><p>Rabbits have very large eyes that are located on either side of their heads. This eye placement is helpful in the wild because it enables rabbits to see things coming at them from both sides. Rabbits' eyes are also usually farsighted so they can easily see predators approaching from far away. Unfortunately, because of their anatomy, rabbitsare prone to a variety of eye problems.</p><h2>Why Do Rabbits Have Eye Problems? </h2><p>Despite their benefits in the wild, rabbit eyes also have weaknesses. Because of the eyes' location on each side of the head, rabbits have a blind spot directly in front of them. Their eyes are also so large that objects often injure them. Common eye issues in rabbits range from foreign objects in the eye to injuries and diseases.</p><h2>Foreign Bodies in the Eye </h2><p>A foreign body is anything in your rabbit's eye that shouldn't be there, such as a piece of bedding, food, or something else that doesn't belong in or around the eye. These items are often lightweight and may end up getting stuck in a large eye.</p><h2>Rabbit Eye Abscesses </h2><p>The eye itself may be punctured, become infected, and abscess. More commonly, the area directly under the eye swells up, and an abscess forms because of a wound around the eye. You may notice that a bump under your rabbit's eye just suddenly appears one day. This is usually caused by a scratch or a bite that got infected.</p><h2>Rabbit Eye Ulcers </h2><p>When something gets stuck in your rabbit's eye (such as bedding) or another trauma occurs to the eyeball itself, damage to the clear, outermost layer of the eye called the can occurand an ulcer may result. An ulcer is a hole or defect in the cornea. It could be a small spot or could cover the entire eye. Ulcers are very painful. Your rabbit may be holding its eye shut or be scratching the eye with its paw. These are signs that the eye is painful or irritating to your rabbit.</p><h2>Rabbit EyeConjunctivitis </h2><p>Also known as ""pink eye,"" conjunctivitis is inflammation of the pink flesh that surrounds your rabbit's eye. This pink- to red-colored fleshy part is called the . A rabbit can get conjunctivitis from dirty water or an environment that harbors bacteria, such as a dirty cage or a litter box that they like to lie in.</p><h2>Rabbit EyeProptosis </h2><p>This is probably the worst type of eye problemand also the least common one in rabbits. occurs when the eyeball pops out of your rabbit's head. Really the only way this would ever happen is because of major trauma, such as a dog attack, or if your bunny is squeezed so tightly that its eye comes out.</p><h2>Rabbit Eye Iris Prolapse </h2><p>Also referred to as a , an occurs when the part of the eye that constricts and dilates, called the , sticks out through the cornea. This is not a common eye problem, but if it occurs in your rabbit, you may see a visible bump on the surface of your rabbit's eye.</p><h2>Blindness in Rabbits </h2><p>Sometimes rabbits are born blind due to congenital issues,and at other times, trauma or a medical issue like cataracts can cause blindness. Regardless of the reason for its blindness, a pet bunny should be OK without its sight. It will still be able to smell where its food is in its cage, but be aware that it may have trouble navigating outside of an enclosure that it's not used to being in.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment for rabbit eye issues varies based on the diagnosis. Most infection-based problems can be cleared up with antibiotics. Rabbits cannot take all kinds of antibiotics, so it's important that you seek out a veterinarian who's knowledgeable in rabbit medicine. Take any eye issue seriously and consult your vet right away if you suspect something is wrong with your rabbit's eyes. There's no cure for blindness in rabbits unless the blindness is caused by a cataract that can be removed.</p><h2>Treating Foreign Bodies </h2><p>By using a cotton swab, saline rinse, and sometimes even some eye lubrication, you may be able to remove the item from your rabbit's eye. If you are unsuccessful, take your rabbit to your exotics vet so that they can safely remove the foreign body without injuring the eye. Sometimes the foreign body is so difficult to remove or your rabbit won't open its eye up that some light sedation, or anesthesia, is administered. This will relax your bunny and allow your vet to work more quickly without causing harm to the eye.</p><h2>Treating Abscesses </h2><p>Regardless of the reason for the abscess, it's essential for your rabbit to visit your vet and have its eye cleaned out. This will allow the abscess to drain and the infection to be removed. Your vet may use a scalpel blade or a needle to open the abscess and then gently squeeze the infected material out of it. Depending on how bad the area around the eye looks, your vet may then send you home with eye drops and systemic antibiotics (usually a liquid you give via your rabbit's mouth) to prevent the infection from spreading.</p><h2>Treating Ulcers </h2><p>To diagnose an ulcer, your exotics vet will use a special eye stain that will stick to the ulcer on the eye. Then they'll use a special light that illuminates any stain that's sticking to an ulcer. If an ulcer is present, you'll be sent home with medications and your rabbit will need to be rechecked in a few days or a week to make sure the ulcer is going away and not getting worse.</p><h2>Treating Conjunctivitis </h2><p>Rabbit eyes usually get bacterial conjunctivitis. A vet will diagnose it and it will require an antibiotic eye drop or ointment to treat it.</p><h2>Treating Rare Conditions </h2><p>If a rabbit has proptosis, the eye typically has to be removed, as it will be hanging from the optic nerve. Sometimes it can be surgically replaced. An iris prolapse is painful and also rare. It may go away in response to treatment with simple eye drops. Sometimes surgery is needed to replace the protruding portion of the iris and suture the hole in the cornea to close it.</p>",1054

Often the movie or a plate of tasty bacon first come to mind when people think of pigs, but there's much more to these brilliant barnyard creatures than breakfast. Did you know, for example, that pigs are smarter than most kids under the age of three? Or that there are twice as many pigs as there are people in Denmark?</p><p>Read on to learn more fascinating facts about pigs including the history of thedinosaurpigthat roamed the earth over 15 million years ago! And check out some cute photos of the farm's smartest, most social animals.</p><h2>Pigs Have a Long History Around the World </h2><p>Nope, it wasn't a breed of cat or dog pigs were the very first animals to be domesticated by humans. The earliest written evidence of a pig farm dates back to 3468 BC China, but many historians believe pigs were domesticated as long as 6,000 years ago.</p><p>A few years later in 1539, to be precise pigs crossed the ocean and arrived in America with Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto.</p><h2>A Dinosaur Pig Lived During the Late Eocene Epoch </h2><p>According to fossil records, entelodonts, pig-like dinosaurs, roamed the planet about 16.3 million years ago, during the late Eocene and early Miocene epochs.</p><p>Enteledonts didn't completely resemble today's domesticated pigs, however. They stood about seven feet tall at the shoulder, had multiple (yes, multiple) sets of teeth, similarly tosharks, and weighed around 1,000 pounds. Because their appearance was so intimidating, entelodonts are often referred to as ""terminator pigs"" or ""hell pigs."" Quite the contrast to the sweet pig in the movie, huh?</p><h2>Pigs Are Incredibly Intelligent Animals </h2><p>Pigs aren't just good looks with their cute snouts and curly tails they're incredibly intelligent animals, too. In fact, it's been proven that pigs are smarter than dogs, certain kinds of primates, and even human children under the age of three.</p><p>So, just how smart are these barnyard geniuses? Research has shown that pigs have excellent long-term memories. They can differentiate between pigs they know and pigs they don't; they know when human are being nice to them and when they aren't, and they can socially manipulate other pigs into doing their bidding!Sure, toddlers can be manipulative in other kinds of ways, but socially? We don't think so.</p><h2>Piglets Can Recognize Their Moms' Voices and Learn Their Names </h2><p>Remember that whole thing about pigs being geniuses? Well, those major smarts aren't just limited to adult pigs newborn piglets are pretty darn brainy, too. In fact, they're so intelligent that piglets can learn to run towards their mothers' voiceslearn their human-given names within only two weeks of their birth. When are you gonna catch up, human babies?</p><h2>Pigs Love to Talk </h2><p>Pigs are best known for their high-pitched squeals which, by the way, can reach a whopping 115 decibels in volume about three decibels higher than a jet engine. But that's not their only form of communication. Pigs are constantly chatting it up and have been known to utilize over 20 different vocalizations, all with different meanings.</p><h2>Pigs Are Extremely Social Animals </h2><p>Because pigs are so smart, it should come as no surprise that they're super social. Not only are they playful, curious, and communicative, but they form close bonds with pigs and other species of animals too. When they're sleeping (or if it's just a little chilly out) they love to cuddle up, often snout to snout, for warmth and comfort. Can you think of anything cuter?</p><p>Related:Awesome Names for Pet Pot-Bellied Pigs</p><h2>Pigs Can Run Faster Than You Think </h2><p>Have you run a mile lately? What was your time? If it was around seven minutes per mile, you're as speedy as a typical domesticated pig. Yup, you read that right. An adult pig can run about 11 miles per hour, or seven minutes per mile.</p><p>Don't partner up with a piggy for your marathon training just yet, though pigs' lungs are relatively small in proportion to their body size, making their seven miles per hour pace unsustainable over longer distances.</p><h2>Pigs Have Super Powerful Noses </h2><p>Although pigs have the poorest vision among barnyard animals, their sense of smell is incredibly powerful. It's so strong that many farmers use their pigs to find rare (and pricey) truffles hidden underground hence the name ""truffle pig."" Plus, their snouts are extra sturdy and flexible, so they can easily root around in the dirt and mud.</p><h2>Sows Sing to Their Piglets </h2><p>Pigs love to communicate with each other. But here's the sweetest fun fact you'll heartoday:Momma pigs otherwise known as sows are often heard ""singing"" to their piglets while they're nursing. I'm not crying, you're crying.</p><h2>Pigs Can't Actually Sweat </h2><p>We've all said it hundredsof times:""I'm sweating like a pig."" Well, this old adage is factually inaccurate because pigs actually don't sweat. They have very few sweat glands, making it nearly impossible for them to perspire. Their preferred method of cooling down? Splashing around in a body of water or a giant mud puddle. There's even an island in the Bahamas you can visit to cool off and swim around with them.</p><h2>Pigs Don't Really ""Pig Out"" </h2><p>When it comes to piggies, there's no such thing as ""eating like a pig"" or ""pigging out."" It's true that pigs will eat just about anything including garbage and human bones, according to some reports but theytend to eat slowly, savoring each bite of food with their whopping 15,000 tastebuds. For reference, we humans only have about 9,000 tastebuds.</p><h2>There's No Such Thing as Teacup Pigs </h2><p>Despite all of those cute Instagrams you've seen, teacup pigs area breed of pig. In fact, teacups don't exist at all. Rather, ""teacup"" is a name breeders give everyday potbellied pigs that have been malnourished or inbred to stunt their growth.</p><p>There are many myths and misconceptions around so-called ""teacup"" pigs, so if you're considering adding one to your family, do your research first. Not only is it unethical to buy a ""teacup"" pig breeders often use extremely cruel methods to achieve a smaller pig size but doing so can have serious consequences for the health of the pig and your family. What's more, ""teacup"" pigs generally only live for about five years due to issues with their skeletal and immune systems that result from starvation and inbreeding.</p>",1042
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/supplies-needed-for-a-pet-hamster-1238928,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How to Care for Your Pet Hamster</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for Your Pet Hamster</h1><h2>Make sure you have everything you need for your new pet</h2><p>Hamsters are pretty common household pets. These small rodents usually live for about two years and do best if housed alone. There are different breeds of hamsters, and they range in size and characteristics. Know your breed and what its full-grown size will be so you can purchase the right sized cage and equipment. Hamsters are naturally nocturnal, so be prepared for some noises at night and position the cage in an area that works for you and your new pet.</p><h2>Before You Begin </h2><p>Before you buy any pet, make sure you have a home set up for it to minimize the stress of adjusting to a new home. Hamsters have a specific set of needs. They require exercise and mental stimulation, as well as a well-ventilated cage with a place to hide. Your hamster will also need a varied diet with a mix of store-bought food and fresh food. Make sure you know what your new pet can (and can't) eat.</p><h2>What You Need </h2> <h2>Choose the Right Hamster Cage </h2><p>Get a cage that is large enough for your hamster, escape-proof, and easy to clean. While the modular cages with tubes are fun, they can be difficult to clean and are poor for ventilation (and the tubes can be too small for some Syrian hamsters). Never underestimate the ability of a hamster to escape, as it can fit through pretty small spaces and chew through plastic walls surprisingly quickly.</p><p>If you are getting a Syrian hamster, keep in mind that many cages marketed for hamsters will be on the small side. If you are getting a dwarf hamster, be aware that they can often squeeze through the bars of an average-sized hamster cage.You'll want to fully clean the hamster cage once a week. Safely remove the hamster and place it in a secure location while the cage is being cleaned.</p><h2>Add Hamster Bedding and Nesting Material </h2><p>Avoid cedar and pine-wood chips for bedding for your hamster; the odor can be irritating to hamsters' respiratory systems. Aspen is a safer option if you prefer to use wood bedding, but many people prefer to use paper or other fiber-based beddings. Hamsters love a cozy nest for napping. The cotton nesting materials found at pet stores is unnecessary and can cause problems if eaten or if it gets wrapped around their toes. Shredded toilet paper or facial tissues are excellent nesting materials and are economical as well. Bedding materials can be cleaned out and replaced during the weekly cage cleaning.</p><h2>Choose Hamster Food and Containers </h2><p>Pick a good quality food for your hamster. Pelleted foods offer a good nutritional balance and for many hamsters are a better option than loose food mixes. With a loose mix (seeds and other items), your hamster might pick out what it likes and leave what it doesn't, which could result in a dietary imbalance or an overweight hamster. A pelleted mix can be supplemented with a variety of other items, including fresh vegetables. Hamsters should be fed once a day. Remove any fresh food that has not been eaten within a few hours.</p><p>A shallow, small but heavy bowl (anything that won't be easily tipped over) is ideal as a food dish for your hamster. A small ceramic or porcelain crock is a great option, as they are sturdy and won't be chewed up. You don't need to get fancy and buy a special hamster dish, but make sure whatever you choose won't be chewed up the next day.</p><p>A small hanging water bottle with a stainless steel spout and ball is the most commonly used water container for hamsters. A bowl is too likely to be spilled, dirtied,or filled with bedding. Make sure your hamster always has fresh water.</p><h2>Offer Exercise Options </h2><p>Hamsters love to run and need the exercise, so purchase the largest, best-quality exercise wheel you can. It should have a solid surface for running and ideally no cross supports (that might catch a leg or neck). Look for one that mounts on the side of the cage. Make sure the wheel is quiet as well since hamsters run at night. A small amount of vegetable oil dripped onto the wheel axis may aid in keeping the wheel quiet.</p><p>In addition to a wheel, your hamster should have a variety of things to chew on and climb on. Hamsters need a lot of stimulation and exercise, or they can become bored. Bored hamsters start trying to chew through everything, with escape being the likely outcome. Plenty of hamster-safe items exist in the pet store, or you can use toilet paper tubes and tissue boxes to make toys for your hamster.</p><h2>Consider a Hamster House or Hide Box </h2><p>Your hamster will appreciate a private getaway for sleeping. A house or hide boxcan be as simple as a small cardboard box (it will have to be replaced often but is economical), a plastic hide box (it may be chewed up), a wooden box (it may be chewed or get soiled and smelly), or other things like a half coconut shellor a small clay plant pot. Upside-down plastic food storage containers such as a butter tub can be used if you cut out a door for your hamster (making sure there are no sharp edges).</p><h2>Preventing Problems With Your Hamster During Care </h2><p>Hamsters are pretty hardy pets. The issue is that if something goes wrong, the hamster is so small, it will be affected pretty quickly. Keep an eye out of an inactive hamster, not eating, diarrhea, hair loss, sneezing, or runny eyes. Some of these can be due to infections or even pneumonia. Try to keep your hamster warm and hydrated and speak to your vet about what to do.</p><p>A hamster escape is another common issue. If your hamster escapes, keep watch near the cage and then spread your search out to other rooms. Since they are nocturnal creatures, keep watch at night and check under and behind furniture. If possible, leave the cage open with plenty of food so the hamster can return on its own.</p>",1016
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-raise-mealworms-1237234,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>How to Raise Mealworms</h1>,"<h1>How to Raise Mealworms</h1><p>Mealworms are the larvae of mealworm beetles and are used as a food source for many different exotic pets. Reptiles, amphibians, sugar gliders, skunks, chickens, hedgehogs, and other animals consider various sizes of mealworms as part of their regular diet, but they don't always contain the nutritional components these pets need because they are often sitting in a store without food for extended periods of time. Additionally, the cost of regularly purchasing live food sources, such as mealworms, can become inconvenient and expensive to pet owners. Thankfully, raising your own mealworms is easy to do and can help you ensure your pet is receiving nutrient-dense food.</p><h3>Project Overview</h3><p>Working Time: 15 minutes</p><p>Total Time: 2 months</p><p>Yield: Hundreds of mealworms</p><p>Skill Level: Beginner</p><p>Estimated Cost: $20</p><h2>Before You Begin </h2><p>In order to raise mealworms, you'll need a little bit of space dedicated to housing your mealworm colony. This space should never get too cold, so do not keep your mealworm colony in a garage or basement that will get cold in the winter.</p><p>Next, supplies and the adult mealworms will need to be purchased, and a couple of months will need to go by before you can start feeding your pet your homegrown mealworms. This means that you will still need to purchase mealworms at the store for at least two months after you set up your mealworm breeding enclosure. You will need this amount of time for your mealworms to grow.</p><p>This project won't take up much of your time to start, but once it is set up, you'll need to be patient. If you only need a few mealworms for a short period of time, raising mealworms probably isn't necessary. But if you expect to need mealworms for at least a year, the sooner you start this project, the sooner you'll have nutritious, convenient food for your pet on an ongoing basis.</p><h2>Materials You'll Need </h2><p>It's easy to start raising mealworms for your pet. All you need are a few inexpensive items!</p><h3>What You'll Need</h3><p> </p><p>For your mealworm colony container, a shoe storage bin with holes poked in the lid, a small aquarium with a screen top, or a plastic Penn-Plax container with a vented lid are all great options. You'll just want to make sure that the container you choose will allow light to go through it (i.e. is clear or translucent), has a solid bottom to prevent the mealworms from escaping, and has holes in the lid to allow for ventilation. Any store-bought bran or oats are good for the substrate and a raw potato cut in half will provide food and water for your mealworms.</p><h2>When You Can Feed Mealworms After Growth </h2><p>Once you've placed your store-bought, adult mealworms into the new enclosure you set-up for them, you'll have to wait at least two months for your mealworms to go through one life cycle. Because the mealworms you buy at a store are already in the larval stage, they should pupate in about three weeks. Two weeks after they pupate, the mealworm beetles should emerge. These beetles will lay very small eggs which are difficult to see in the substrate. When these eggs hatch, the new larvae are also very small so don't expect to be able to watch this process very closely but you will see the mealworm beetles die while the larvae grow. This life cycle will continue to repeat with any mealworms you don't feed to your pet but after just one life cycle, your mealworm colony should be well established and you can start using it to feed your exotic pet.</p><h2>Mealworm Sizes </h2><p>A mealworm is the larval stage of the mealworm beetle so despite common misconception, there are not different sizes of mealworms unless you feed a juvenile hormone to your worms. This is how the giant mealworm is grown. There are, however, different ages of larvae; emerging larvae are going to be smaller than larvae that are about to pupate. A mealworm larva will molt (just like tarantulas and hermit crabs) between nine and 20 times before it pupates, so after each molt it will grow ever so slightly, but it won't naturally grow to be longer than about an inch without feeding it juvenile hormones. If your pet needs larger worms, superworms () may be a good alternative to raise. They go through the same life cycle, so the process to raise superworms is the same as it is for raising mealworms.</p><h2>Maintaining Your Mealworm Colony </h2><p>Once you start feeding the mealworms from your colony to your pet, you can offer a commercial diet for gut-loading or a home-made variety of vegetables and fruits such as carrots, orange slices, and leafy greens to the colony to gut load them. This will increase the nutritional value and change fix the low Ca: high P ratio mealworms, crickets, or any other type of bug you purchase online or in-person. Be sure to remove any uneaten food before it begins to mold or rot though; this can cause your mealworms to die.</p><p>Once you have a large supply of mealworms, the dirty substrate can be filtered out and the mealworms can be saved to put in the clean substrate. If you filter the substrate before your colony is well established, you are likely to filter out all the eggs or new larvae and the life cycle will be interrupted. Provide at least one or two inches of substrate so that your mealworms can burrow so you will need to add more bran or oats as necessary to maintain this level. You may also need to completely change out the substrate on occasion to keep it clean and fresh as well as wipe down the container.</p><h2>Does Temperature Matter? </h2><p>If you are worried about your colony staying warm enough due to cold weather or air conditioning, place a heating pad under the container to keep it warm. If your mealworms get too cold, they will stop growing, and you also won't get any more new worms. If you no longer see new mealworms, make sure the container isn't too cold.</p><p>If you have too many mealworms, simply place the whole container in the fridge to temporarily stop their development. Rewarm it to room temperature when you need them to continue to reproduce. </p>",1036
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/degu-tail-injuries-1238142,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Tail Injuries in Degus</h1>,"<h1>Tail Injuries in Degus</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>0</p><p>With their playful personalities and charming appearance, degus are popular exotic pets for many owners. However, like other pets, degus are susceptible to injuries that require prompt attention from their caregivers. A common medical condition that degus experience is a tail injury and often, injuries like broken bones and tail degloving can be caused by humans. Since their furred tails seem like an easy means of picking these small animals up, accidents can happen during handling. Degu tail injuries can also occur while the pets are inside their enclosures or socializing with other degus. When left untreated, some tail injuries can lead to infections. Knowing the signs and care steps for degus with injured tails is a helpful way to keep your degu healthy.</p><h2>What Are Tail Injuries? </h2><p>Tail injuries in degus refer to any trauma that affects the animal's tail, which can include broken bones or degloving that may cause infections. Degloving is a common occurrence in which the degu sheds its tail, which is also observed in rodents like gerbils. To learn more about how your degu's fragile tail can become hurt, it's helpful to understand the tail's anatomy and purpose.</p><p>Degus have tails about half as long or as long astheir body, or 5 to 6inches in length. They use their tails for balance and as a means of communicating to other degus. The entire length of a healthy degutail is furred, and the end of the tail appears similar to a paintbrush (leading some people to refer to them as trumpet-tailed rats). Under the fur arelayers of skin, nerves, muscle, and vertebrae that enable the degu to beat, wag, and balance with its tail.Because it includes multiple types of delicate tissue, it's not uncommon for your degu's tail to become injured.</p><h2>Types of Tail Injuries in Degus </h2><h2>Symptoms of Tail Injuries in Degus </h2><p>Tail injuries are typically visible to owners, especially in cases of degloving.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Most symptoms are associated with degloved tails, but degus can also experience lesions from minor injuries. If your degu is handled improperly or experiences other trauma, the animal may shed its tail. This can be an alarming sight for owners, as the tail will bleed, bones may be obviously broken, and the degu's tail skin will slip off. As it heals, the tail will eventually detach completely. This may include the tip or a larger portion of the tail.</p><p>In other cases, your degu's tail may have less severe injuries that lead to lesions. Exposed skin from degloving and lesions can cause infection if not cared for properly, which typically presents with symptoms like discharge, swelling, or an unusual odor. Veterinary attention should be sought quickly to begin treatments with medication if any signs of infection are present.</p><h2>Causes of Tail Injuries </h2><p>Degus may become injured by their owners, objects in their cages, or by other degus in multi-pet enclosures.</p><h2>Diagnosing Tail Injuries in Degus </h2><p>Most injuries to a degu's tail can be observed by its owners. If your degu's tail has degloved or you suspect that a minor injury has occurred, it's best to consult your veterinarian. Your exotics vet can diagnose injuries that may lead to infection through a physical examination and provide proper treatment options.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If your degu has received a degloving injury to the end ofits tail, it is very important to clean it with water if possible. These injuries typically bleed, and when the skin is lost, the wound should be sutured by a veterinarian. Some veterinarians recommend sutures if the bleeding hasn't stopped after 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p>If the bleeding stops on its own or after applying a styptic powder, cornstarch, or flour to aid in clotting, then it will dry out after a couple of days. Once the tail end has dried out, your degu will usually chew the end of its tail off. The owner should monitor the tail for any discharge, smell, or swelling that could indicate an infection. This is also important if your degu experiences lethargy or a loss of appetite.</p><p>If you are unsure whether your degu's tail is healing, have your exotics veterinarian examine it to determine whether or not antibiotics are needed. Degus can be sensitive to some medications commonly used for humans and other animals, so any medicine administered to your degu should be prescribed by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Prognosis for Degus With Tail Injuries </h2><p>In cases of degloving, most degus can recover fully on their own or with treatments by a veterinarian to suture their wounds and prevent infection. Any indicators of infection should be promptly treated after an examination by your exotics veterinarian. Like other types of infection, those caused by tail injuries or degloving of the tail can lead to serious health issues when left untreated. </p><h2>How to Prevent Tail Injuries </h2><p>Even with proper care, accidents can still happen.</p><h3>Careful Handling </h3><p>Owners can significantly lessen the risk of their degus experiencing tail injuries by never picking these animals up by their tails. It's also important to prevent enclosure hazards by never placing wire exercise wheels in a degu's cage, carefully avoiding the animal's tail when closing cage doors, and setting down degu houses or food and water bowls with care. Always be aware of where your degu's tail is when handling the animal or moving items inside its enclosure.</p><h3>Monitoring Signs of Illness </h3><p>Observe your degu's normal behavior and appearance to be proactive when it's acting abnormally. Degus should have clear eyes, glossy fur, and clean bodies and tails. Look out for any signs of infection, even if your degu's tail does not appear to be injured. Small cuts and scrapes may occur from objects inside your pet's cage, and all injuries should be monitored by owners (and veterinarians, as necessary). </p>",972
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/my-adoption-story-a-bunny-for-the-holidays-5214186,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>My Adoption Story: A Bunny for the Holidays </h1>,"<h1>My Adoption Story: A Bunny for the Holidays </h1><p>Pets are a great source of joy for many people, especially around the holidays. People adopting new pets are usually thrilled to have new furry companions, but for Tam Tangonan, it has been one very different season.</p><p>On November 29, right after Thanksgiving, Tam welcomed home a new bunny friend, Penny. Penny is a 7-month-old dwarf Dutch mix bunny who has a lively mix of energy and a love of baby carrots that Tam loves dearly. However, her arrival is quite bittersweet during this time.</p><p>This past July, Tam's bunny companion of six years, Jojo, died. Jojo was 9 years old when Tam adopted him, and passed away this summer after a long battle with dental disease. This winter, she will have to go through her first Christmas and New Year's without the friend who was there for her for so many years.</p><p>Tam Tangonan</p><p>""It really hit me hard when I was looking through my Christmas decorations, and I found the little stocking that I made for him,"" Tam said. ""And it really hit me that he's not here with me anymore. and it made me really want to pursue a new rabbit more.""</p><h2>Room for Another </h2><p>Tam always knew that when her time with Jojo was over, she'd want another pet in her life. However, due to being allergic to both cats and dogs, it seemed another bunny would have to be in the works.</p><p>After losing Jojo, Tam was initially unsure if she could handle having another bunny in her life. She is, however, taking the time to remember that Penny isn't here to ""replace"" Jojo but to bring her a different sort of emotional support and relationship.</p><p>TamTangonan</p><p>""I wanted to get her before the holidays for my own goal to have her as a companion during that time,"" Tam said. ""Because the holidays are hard for me, especially without Jojo because I've always been with him.""</p><p>Jojo had been Tam's certified emotional support animal, and Tam is hoping that Penny can bring her a similar sort of joy.</p><p>Tam's known since she was a little girl that bunnies are her go-to favorite pets.</p><p>""I was instilled to love them by my grandmother who used to give me rabbit stuff for Easter,"" she said. ""And I remember when I was 5 years old, and I chose bunnies nuzzling together as fabric for my curtains, and I really insisted on that!""</p><h2>The Memories Live On </h2><p>Tam had been with Jojo since he was 3 years old, taking him across the coast from Baltimore to Los Angeles. The friends had shared many snuggles, romps in the park, kisses, and treats over the years until Jojo died.</p><p>Even though it was hard to be without Jojo, Tam knew he was watching over her still and would want her to be happy. When her friend sent her a listing on NextDoor for a ""free bunny,"" she became curious about Penny's story after seeing pictures of her.</p><p>""I went in thinking it was a free bunny and thought that was strange,"" she said. ""Turns out, I'm glad she wasn't ""free"" literally because it meant she was vaccinated and spayed.""</p><p>Instead of being literally free, the listing was actually advertising adopting Penny the rabbit through a local rabbit shelter. Tam applied to adopt Penny, showed the shelter her room, contacted her foster parent, and eventually brought Penny home to her Los Angeles apartment.</p><h2>Figuring Each Other Out </h2><p>Penny is now warming up to Tam and letting her pet her and giving her binkies (a bunny's way of bowing to show a willingness to be pet and given attention), but she was initially quite skittish.</p><p>""I was excited but she was quite terrified,"" Tam explained. ""She has been through a lot, like when she was first rescued, she was with a homeless man who was trying to sell her and had matted fur!</p><p>She added: When we first got her, it took her 30 minutes when we first brought her in for her to come out of her cage. ""It's still taking her some time to get used to everything.""</p><p>But Penny is warming up every day, grinding her teeth and flopping on the floor to indicate she feels safe and content. Tam enjoys playing with her, even if it is bittersweet as she misses Jojo.</p><p>""It's tough because I'm trying to not compare them to each other, especially because Jojo was more friendly and let me pet him more easily when I first got him,"" she said. ""Penny is a lot more cautious.""</p><p>Her fond memories of Jojo haven't stopped Tam from deeply appreciating her new friend. ""Penny has changed my life to give me something to look forward to and someone to talk to,"" she said. ""I do feel a connection with her, and it's still surface level but I'm trying to get to know her better. I feel like she's gone through so much, I'm trying to let her have space and let her come to me. ""</p><p>Tam says rabbits in general have changed her life by helping give her a routine and someone to give her love to, as well as the ability to take care of something other than herself.</p><p>""I definitely need that as someone who has a lot of chaos and stuff that has happened to me,"" she said. ""They give me stability through the routines and even with emotional regulation, I can do that with them.</p><p>When I had Jojo, I'd sometimes come to him when I had a panic attack,"" she said. ""And he'd come to me and lick my face. I'm not trying to replace Jojo in that way because he was his own soul, but I hope I can come to Penny when I'm feeling down and also gain comfort and I can comfort her too.""</p><p>Tam said that she hopes that anyone who may be thinking about getting a rabbit, remember that it is a lot of responsibility and not just something to look at in a cage.</p><p>""It's a whole being to take care of."" she said. ""Be mindful of that, especially because with the holidays coming up, people give their children rabbits and it's a family animal. It can take up more of your time. It's rewarding, but it is work!""</p>",1035
29,https://www.thesprucepets.com/water-dragon-lighting-1239577,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Lighting for Your Pet Chinese Water Dragon</h1>,"<h1>Lighting for Your Pet Chinese Water Dragon</h1><h2>Heat and UVB Lighting Choices</h2><p>Pet water dragons require special reptile bulbs to light and heat their enclosures. Without appropriate lighting, water dragons can develop a multitude of problems. By knowing what kind of lighting your water dragon needs you can prevent these problems and help your pet live a long and healthy life.</p><h2>Heat Lights for Water Dragons </h2><p>The bulbs needed to heat an enclosure all fit in the same type of fixture, an incandescent ceramic socket, and can be purchased from almost any pet store. Heat lights, and not undertank heaters or hot rocks, are recommended as the primary source of heat for your pet. Submersible water heaters should be used to help heat the water dragon water.</p><p>Water dragons should have a basking temperature in the upper 80s and a cooler side of their tank in the upper 70s. The water should remain in the 80s.</p><h3>Ceramic Heat Bulbs </h3><p>Ceramic heat bulbs provide no light to an enclosure but they do provide heat. Just like regular incandescent light bulbs, they come in different wattages. The wattage needed depends on the size of the enclosure and if any other heat bulbs are used. Unlike regular incandescent bulbs, they last for an extremely long time, making them more cost-effective, but they do not deliver UVA rays. Therefore, these are a heat assist device to a bulb that emits UVA rays (full spectrum fluorescent or UVA ray emitting heat bulb). Make sure these bulbs are not placed on a surface that will melt.</p><h3>Mercury Vapor Bulbs </h3><p>Mercury vapor bulbs are for very large enclosures. They are very powerful UVB emitters but also give off heat. Unless you have a huge enclosure for your dragon and can hang the mercury vapor light several feet away from your pet, these are not typically good options for water dragons.</p><h3>Incandescent Heat Bulbs </h3><p>These are your typical heat lights that emit light, UVA rays, and varying wattages of heat. Different bulb sizes and shapes are available, as well as colors of light (wavelengths). Daylight bulbs are regular white lights, nightlight bulbs are blue/purple lights (make sure the bulb isn't painted glass but is, in fact, blue/purple glass), and nocturnal lights are red (don't use painted bulbs). The wattage needed depends on the size of the enclosure and if any other heat bulbs are used.</p><p>Basking lights are shaped to direct heat into the area directly below the bulb as opposed to the entire tank and are usually shaded on the sides to assist in directing the light downward.</p><h3>Halogen Heat Bulbs </h3><p>These bulbs do all the same things as incandescent heat bulbs and even though they cost a bit more, they emit more heat, light, and UVA rays than an incandescent bulb of the same size. They also usually last longer and use less energy than incandescents.</p><p>Some halogen bulbs fit in incandescent fixtures and others fit in halogen fixtures. Make sure your bulbs fit into your fixtures before purchasing them.</p><h2>UVB Lights </h2><p>Water dragons and most other reptiles require UVB light. This is an invisible wavelength that the sun naturally emits to help reptiles metabolize calcium that you feed them. Without it, your water dragon may be lethargic, not eat, and develop metabolic bone disease, among other things. Water dragons need 10 to 12 hours of UVB light daily to stay healthy.</p><p>Aside from sunlight (not filtered through a window), there are a couple of different sources that give off invisible UVB rays. Fluorescent bulbs and mercury vapor bulbs are the two most commonly used sources of UVB in the pet world.</p><h3>Fluorescent Bulbs </h3><p>Special fluorescent bulbs that fit into fluorescent fixtures give off varying levels of UVA and UVB (usually given as percentages) rays. These full-spectrum bulbs run out of rays before the lights burn out, therefore they need to be replaced per manufacturer recommendations, or every six months.</p><p>UVB bulbs are to be placed six to eight inches from where your water dragon can get to soak in the invisible rays. Also make sure the bulb is not placed on a plastic, plexiglass, or glass surface. These types of substances will block the rays from penetrating where your reptile needs them. Newer research also shows that the typical metal mesh screen commonly used for reptile tanks blocks a significant amount of UVB rays as well. Therefore, try to mount your bulb on the inside of the enclosure to make sure as many rays reach your dragon as possible.</p><h3>Mercury Vapor Bulbs </h3><p>Mercury vapor bulbs serve more than one purpose for your water dragon but are only for very large enclosures. They emit both UVA and UVB rays and they also provide heat for your enclosure. This allows you to use only one bulb to provide both heat and the important UVA/UVB rays in place of the usual two.</p><p>These bulbs last a great deal longer than fluorescent bulbs and heat bulbs and there is some discussion in the reptile community that mercury vapor bulbs can be dangerous to reptiles because of the intensity of the UV rays produced by these bulbs. Despite the worries, several reptile owners have never had a problem. If you do decide to go with a mercury vapor bulb, be sure to provide plenty of shade opportunities in the enclosure, use a ceramic socket for the bulb, and keep a minimum distance of 12 to 24 inches between your reptile and the bulb for safety reasons.</p><h3>Compact Fluorescent Bulbs </h3><p>These bulbs do all the same things as the regular fluorescent bulbs but they fit in an incandescent fixture. They also use less energy than a fluorescent bulb and should last longer but some research shows the UV is much too high for reptiles and they don't last as long as they should. They are also only good for small enclosures since they concentrate their light in one small area instead of several feet like a traditional fluorescent tube light does.</p><p>By offering appropriate heat and UVB lighting to your pet water dragon you can avoid a plethora of problems (and several visits to your exotics vet).</p>",1008

These little four-legged pets are not only roaming farms but living in homes now, too.</p><p>However, there are many myths and misconceptions surrounding Teacup pigs, which could lead to hurting their health and happiness if not properly addressed. Having a ""teacup"" pig can result in serious consequences for both the pig and your family so it's important to do all of your research before contacting a breeder.</p><p>Read on to learn more about ""teacup"" pigs, and why they might not be the right pet for you.</p><h3>What is a Teacup Pig?</h3><p>Teacups pigs are not miniature potbellys. Teacup pigs are actually potbellied pigs that have been starved to remain so tiny.</p><h2>""Teacup"" Pigs Don't Really Exist </h2> <p>Nope, ""teacup"" is a breed of pig, and it's not quite a nickname for a new breed either. Rather, ""teacup"" is a label that breeders give regular potbellied pigs that have been malnourished to stunt their growth or are falsely advertised as miniature.</p><p>Pet potbellied pigs are indeed generally smaller than the standard farm pig. They can weigh between 100 and 200 pounds, while farm pigs run about 1,000 pounds. But that's far from the 10 to 12-pound ""teacup"" claim many breeders make. Even the smallest pot-bellied pig will weigh between 60 and 80 pounds. They may be considered underweight depending on the pig's stature, activity levels, and the environment.</p><h2>Maintaining a ""Teacup"" Pig's Small Size Seriously Hurts Their Health </h2> <p>It's tough to hear, but many ""teacup"" breeders use cruel methods to keep their pigs small or stunt their growth.</p><h2>What You See Isn't What You Get With ""Teacup"" Pigs </h2><p>publicdomainpictures.net</p><p>If a ""teacup"" breeder shows you your potential piggy's parents, he or she is probably just showing you potbellied piglets. Pigs can breed as young as three months old. Because of this, parents to piglets are oftentimes piglets themselves meaning you can't determine how big your ""teacup"" pig will be based on the size and appearance of his or her parents.</p><p>What's more, some shady ""teacup"" pig breeders will simply show potential buyers infant potbellied pigs that will eventually grow into full-sized adolescents and adults.</p><h2>""Teacup"" Pigs Are Extremely Expensive </h2> <p>If you want to purchase a ""teacup"" pig, be prepared to drop a whopping $750 to $3,500 on your new pet. After buying, the cost of keeping a pig as a pet only climbs from there.</p><p>Because many ""teacup"" owners believe their pigs will remain small, they don't even consider the cost of raising a 100-pound (plus) pig in their home. Between adequate food supply (potbellied pigs can eat , check-ups and vaccinations at the veterinarian, and other piggy supplies, it can cost thousands of dollars each year to own a pig. Plus, it's recommended to spay or neuter pet pigs to limit unpleasant behaviors and reduce the risk of certain cancers. But, this may prove challenging, as it may be difficult to track down a specialty vet who can perform the surgery.</p><h2>""Teacup"" Pigs Have a Very Short Lifespan </h2> <p>Although the average potbellied pig is expected to live anywhere between 12 and 18 years, a ""teacup"" pig's lifespan typically hovers around five years due to issues with their skeletal and immune systems. Genetic disorders caused by inbreeding can also contribute to a shorter lifespan.</p><h2>Pigs Need a Lot of Space </h2> <p>Pigs, in general, take up a lot of space, and not just because they're large. Pigs require daily exercise so they don't become bored, which could lead to destructive or aggressive behavior. Some can even become aggressive towards humans and bite or charge. Many pigs are abandoned or surrendered to shelters simply because their owners don't have the space to keep them happy, healthy, and engaged.</p><h2>Owning Any Kind of Pig May Be Illegal Where You Live </h2> <p>Believe it or not, keeping a pig as a pet may be illegal where you live. Zoning laws in several states consider pigs strictly farm animals and won't allow them in non-farming or non-agricultural settings.</p><p>If you're considering adding a pig to the family, be sure to check out the zoning laws in your area. A little bit of research can help prevent the abandonment or surrender of many domesticated pigs each year.</p><h2>Pigs Are Herd Animals </h2> <p>Did you know pigs are extremely social animals? Much like dogs, pigs develop ""packs,"" often playing, lounging, and sleeping together. Depriving a pig of his or her social interaction can cause the pig to become bored, restless, or depressed, and he or she may act out aggressively.</p><p>That being said, it's best to keep at least two pigs at a time, but many ""teacup"" owners who find themselves struggling with a 100 pound-plus pig will have an even harder time with two or more. Not to mention, double the pigs means double the expenses for food, supplies, and vet visits.</p><h2>Owning a Pig Is Not Like Owning a Cat or Dog </h2><p>maxpixel.net</p><p>Pigs are indeed extremely intelligent, playful animals who are capable of forming deep, loving bonds with their humans. For some families, they're the perfect pet! Owning a pig, however, is different than owning a cat or a dog. New pig owners are often surprised to learn how much work and money pig ownership truly requires.</p><p>Unfortunately, many people who purchase ""teacup"" pigs are not prepared for them to grow into full-sized adolescents and adults. When the pigs grow too large, develop health problems, or display destructive behavior, they're often surrendered to shelters or simply abandoned.</p><p>The bottom line? If you're considering purchasing a pig, ensure you have plenty of space, plenty of patience, and the budget to keep him or her happy and healthy.</p><p>Keeping a Pet Pig.</p>",986

Through the years, several studies have been done to assess the intelligence level of many different kinds of animals, many of which we often call pets. But which pets are the smartest? And how is intelligence measured in animals?</p><p>It is difficult to rank animals based on an intelligence scale since this is something that is measured differently in different species. In people, intelligence is ranked by asking questions, problem-solving, and assigning them with an IQ score. But you can't do that the same way with animals. Therefore, a variety of tests, long-term studies, observations, and comparing one species to another is performed in order to assess the overall level of intelligence of different animals.</p><h2>Birds </h2><p>Birds have been studied in-depth and some kinds have definitely been shown to have superior levels of intelligence when compared to other species. The African grey parrot, a popular pet bird, is one type of avian that has shown it is very smart. Harvard University has even demonstrated just how smart African greys can be.</p><p>Many people already know that some birds are capable of talking, but African greys can also identify objects, discern quantities, distinguish between different colors, and even count. In the Harvard study, researchers found that an African grey named Griffin was smarter than a typical 4-year-old.</p><p>In addition to African greys, other parrots are also of course very smart and so are crows.</p><h2>Primates </h2><p>Chimpanzees are very closely related to humans. Not only do people share 99% of their DNA with this animal, but they also share a high level of intelligence. Chimps have long been studied and are known to have emotions such as empathy and regret; make and utilize a number of tools in order to hunt and get food; have long-term memory; recognize themselves in the mirror; learn to identify colors, shapes, and objects; and even use sign language in order to communicate with humans.</p><p>Chimpanzees definitely do not make good pets. Due to their high intelligence, it's difficult to keep them stimulated in a human environment, and they can become destructive and resentful of discipline.</p><h2>Pigs </h2><p>Potbellied pigs are rising in popularity as pets, and more and more people are discovering just how smart these animals are. Pigs are very social and intelligent creatures. They have long-term memories, recognize other pigs as well as humans, and have even been shown to manipulate other pigs.</p><h2>Dogs </h2><p>Dog owners know that dogs are smart. Housebreaking, basic commands, and learning the rules of the house are typically mastered by most canines fairly quickly.</p><p>The Border collie is often touted as one of the smartest breeds of dogs. They are excellent herding dogs, can follow a variety of verbal and hand signal commands, and have been shown to understand more words than other breeds of dogs.</p><h2>Rats and Mice </h2><p>Rats and mice may be small but their intelligence levels are nothing to scoff at. These little rodents are often used in laboratory experiments, but they have also been studied by neuroscientists who have shown just how smart they really are.</p><p>Owners of these charming pets know how affectionate they are, how they love to be scratched and tickled, and how they recognize their owners. They are very clean and social creatures as well. The complexities of their communications, facial expressions, and responses to various stimuli all help demonstrate just how smart rats and mice really are.</p><h2>Cats </h2><p>Some people may not think about a high level of intelligence when it comes to a cat, but felines are actually very smart. Cats can learn tricks, recognize their names, understand basic commands, and have a longer-lasting memory than dogs. Some psychologists feel that cats are more impulsive and less patient than dogs, which is why we don't see cats doing the same tasks as dogs very often.</p><h2>Horses </h2><p>Horses can undoubtedly learn things and even problem solve. Many a horse has figured out how to open up its stall door, buck a human off its back, and get out of a troubling situation. They remember people, words, and the tones in which people speak to them. They have cognitive abilities that enable them to communicate with humans in ways that people can understand and this is not something that every smart animal can do.</p><h2>Raccoons </h2><p>They may be seen as little trash can bandits but raccoons have more going on behind those face masks than one might think. Raccoons are very creative, innovative, and can problem-solve. A study that was published in 1907 even compared the high intelligence of raccoons to that of primates.</p><h2>Monitor Lizards </h2><p>Reptiles don't usually pop up in your mind when you think about smart animals but monitor lizards are highly intelligent and their intelligence may be why many types of monitors aresuch challenging pets. Monitor lizards work together in groups to achieve a common goal, recognize their owners, and can even count.</p><h2>Squirrels </h2><p>Squirrels may get a bad reputation for their daring attempts at crossing busy roads, but these rodents are actually smarter than they look. Many squirrels, such as flying squirrels, have adapted to city life, are very cunning, and even have fake food burial grounds in order to trick other rodents as to their food whereabouts. Squirrels also communicate to warn other squirrels, which demonstrates altruism or a concern for the well-being of others.</p>",990
32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-proof-your-home-4142269,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>How to Bunny Proof Your Home</h1>,"<h1>How to Bunny Proof Your Home</h1><p>Rabbits are curious pets that not only need a lot of space to roam and explore outside of their cage but also tend to get into things they shouldn't. By bunny proofing your home, your rabbit can explore their domain without getting into trouble.</p><h2>Flooring </h2><p>Rabbits love to dig so expect that any ground surface that will allow them to do so will be dug. Unfortunately, for many bunny lovers, this means their carpeting is the victim of their bunny's behavior.</p><p>Area rugs, carpet, and carpet padding are all attractive digging items for your rabbit so if you have them in the room you designate for your rabbit's playtime or home, it is very likely that they will be ruined. If you are okay with this likely potential, then that's fine (just make sure they aren't actually eating what they dig up).</p><p>If you want to avoid the mess and possible fiber ingestion, choose a room for your bunny that has a non-porous, easy-to-clean surface instead. Linoleum, tile, and laminate flooring are popular choices for bunny owners since they can't be dug into, don't absorb urine, and won't stain.</p><p>Baseboards are another concern for chewing rabbits, namely all rabbits. Wooden baseboard corners and edges seem to scream to be chewed on by your rabbit. If these can be avoided in the room where your rabbit roams that is ideal, but if not, you should cover or protect the baseboards to avoid them being destroyed.</p><p>Some rabbit owners make custom baseboard protectors by using pieces of wood with hinges that stand up to block the boards. You can use wire and plastic storage cube pieces that snap together and lean up against the wall, short pieces of wooden fence pickets individually attached with removable adhesive pieces (i.e. Command strips) so they can be replaced as needed, and other creative protective options. Some people simply line the entire room with playpen sections to protect the walls, corners, doors, and baseboards. Plastic corner protectors that attach with adhesive are also useful for baseboard corners.</p><p>If you have carpeting that has been chewed or is especially vulnerable to being chewed (corners that lift up) try placing furniture, litter boxes (if your rabbit is litter box trained), area rugs, or mats meant to be chewed by rabbits on those spots. This will not only hide the area but potentially keep them from chewing it.</p><h2>Doors </h2><p>If you don't use metal baby gates to keep your rabbit contained, then you probably have wooden doors that do the job instead. Rabbits will chew the bottoms and corners of these doors so in order to protect them you can put a kick plate the very bottom of them. A kick plate can also be helpful in covering up previous rabbit damage on the bottom of a door. Also, be sure to remove the door stop if it is at the bunny's level and instead utilize one at the top of the door or install a door handle wall guard.</p><h2>Electrical Cords and Outlets </h2><p>Cords and wires are not only things that are hard to replace on lamps and electronics but they are also extremely dangerous to your bunny if they are chewed.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Electrical shocks and burns are seen in rabbits that chew on wires. Death is possible from the initial electrocution or side effects of the damage it does to the mouth.</p><p>Make sure all electrical cords and wires are out of reach of your rabbit. Utilize ceiling lights whenever possible or keep lamps on a table. Protect cords with plastic cord protectors, flex tubing (corrugated plastic tubing), or PVC pipeif you absolutely cannot avoid a cord being in the room with your rabbit but you should do everything you can to keep your rabbit from having access to electrical cords. Use a baby electrical outlet plug to make sure your rabbit doesn't try to chew the outlet opening as well.</p><h2>Furniture </h2><p>Furniture legs are often the victims of rabbit teeth just like baseboards. They come in so many different shapes and sizes so you may have to get a little creative with coming up with an option to protect them. Flex tubing is a popular choice to slide onto furniture legs since it is flexible and comes in different diameters.</p><p>Large PVC piping is another protective option or you can use temporary chewing alternatives like toilet paper and paper towel tubes to slide onto thin table legs and provide your rabbit with something to shred. Other creative options include plastic flower pots, bed leg risers (turned upside down) or protectors (such as Bed Boots), and plastic furniture corner protectors. You may have to make something to fit the furniture legs in your home if you can't find something to slide over them.</p><h2>Plants </h2><p>All plants should be off the ground and out of your rabbit's reach but ideally, the room your bunny frequents shouldn't have any houseplants at all. While there are some safe plants, some plants are toxic to rabbits if they eat them and potted plants will just be dug up and make a mess so there are really no good reasons to keep them where your bunny is.</p><h2>Provide Chewing Options </h2><p>The best thing you can really do to bunny proof any room is to make sure a variety of chewing options are available to your rabbit at all times. Of course, they will always chew what you don't want them tochew (unless you train them not to) but if they have things they can chew they will be less likely to chew a baseboard, door, or table leg.</p><h2>Make Items Taste Bad to Your Bunny </h2><p>Bitter sprays (such as Grannick's Bitter Applespray) can also be a useful chewing deterrent for items you can't protect. Spray this regularly on fabric furniture, decor, area rug edges, and other items to help discourage your bunny from chewing them by making these items taste bad. There are also lotion or cream options if you need something other than a spray.</p>",993
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reptiles-light-and-heat-1237231,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Why Do Pet Reptiles Need Heat and Light?</h1>,"<h1>Why Do Pet Reptiles Need Heat and Light?</h1><h2>Proper Heat and Temperature Gradient is Vital</h2><p>Many reptiles have specific needs when it comes to heat and light. Meeting these needs is essential to keeping these pets healthy, so it is important to understand why heat and light are so important.</p><h2>The Importance of Heat </h2><p>For all reptiles, providing appropriate temperatures is extremely important. Being ectothermic (""cold-blooded"" although they need warm temperatures) they rely on external temperatures to regulate their body temperature. In the wild, they naturally gravitate to an area with the temperature they need, moving into the sun or shaded areas as necessary. Therefore, a temperature gradient must be provided so that the reptile can choose the appropriate temperature as needed.</p><p>Temperatures must not be so high as to overheat the reptile. Just as important, however, is that temperatures not be too low since processes like digestion are only efficient at the right body temperature. At temperatures that are too low, a reptile may become sluggish and unable to digest its food properly.</p><h2>Temperature Gradient </h2><p>For the reasons mentioned above, a gradient must be provided. Typically a basking light or other heat source can be placed at one end of the tank so that the temperature there is at the high end of the range for the reptile species. The other end should be maintained around the lower temperature range for the species.</p><p>However, providing the gradient isn't quite that simple. Depending on what sort of reptile you are housing, accessories should be placed in the tank in such a way that the reptile can use the gradient while behaving naturally. So, if your reptile likes to hide, some kind of shelter or hide should be provided in both the warm and the cool ends, so the reptile isn't tempted to hide all day in a shelter that is not at the optimum temperature. Similarly, if your reptile is arboreal, the appropriate temperatures must be available up in the branches that the reptile climbs on; the reptile can then thermoregulate and still be in its preferred location.</p><p>This may sound like a lot of trouble, but the key is to provide conditions that mimic what the reptile would find in its natural environment. Invest in a couple of good thermometers and regularly monitor the temperatures in different areas of the cage (especially where your reptile is spending a lot of time) and make sure the temperatures are correct. Remember the proper temperature is vital to your reptile's health!</p><h2>Night Temperatures </h2><p>Many captive reptiles do fine with a slight temperature drop at night (that is what many experience in the wild). Many reptile care sheets recommend a night time or minimum temperature. A slight gradient can still be provided, again to let the reptile choose where it wants to be.</p><h2>Providing Heat </h2><h2>The Importance of Ultraviolet </h2><p>Aside from the need for a regular day-night cycle, some reptiles need specific kinds of light, i.e. UV light. Similar to the requirement for heat, the requirement for UV light is vital for the optimal health of the species who require UV wavelengths. Even for those reptiles that do not need UV light, the provision of a regular day-night cycle is necessary. Without a regular cycle of light and dark, animals will experience stress. Additionally, if breeding is a goal, mimicking the changes in the light-dark cycle that would naturally occur as the seasons' change may be necessary to induce reptiles to breed.</p><h2>Snakes and Nocturnal Lizards </h2><p>Snakes, because they have evolved to eat whole prey, are pretty easy to feed and get virtually all their calcium and vitamin D needs through their diet.</p><p>Nocturnal species of lizards do not get much exposure to UV light in the wild, so do not have any special requirements for UV light producing bulbs.</p><p>Snakes and nocturnal lizards therefore simply need enough light to provide a day-night cycle appropriate for the species, and a regular incandescent bulb is fine. Bulbs used for heating and light are sufficient for these species.</p><p>However, many lizards and all turtles and tortoises need exposure to UVA and UVB light, which must be provided wither by regular exposure to sunlight or special lights.</p><h2>Why Is UV Light Important? </h2><p>Ultraviolet light (UV) is important in the production of vitamin D3, which is necessary for calcium metabolism. Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin with exposure to UV light (from sunlight). While vitamin D3 can be supplemented in the diet, it appears some reptiles, such as iguanas, make better use of vitamin D3 produced within their bodies than that provided in vitamin supplements. Sunlight is an impractical source of UV for most owners (UV light is blocked by glass, so exposure through windows is not a viable option). UV can be provided by special light bulbs.</p><p>The UV light is made up of UVA, UVB, and UVC wavelengths. UVC is harmful, and UVA and UVB are what the reptiles need. The most crucial consideration is the amount of UVB produced, and this is where the selection of an appropriate bulb is necessary.</p><p>Faced with a huge range of light bulbs in a pet store, there is sometimes confusion over which is the best kind to get. Make sure you get a full-spectrum light, that produces more than 1.1 percent UVB. Melissa Kaplan, author of, recommends either the Durtest Vita-Lite or Zoo Med's Reptisun as good lights. Over time, the production of UVB diminishes, and UVB bulbs should be replaced every 9-12 months.</p><p>For those species that require a UVB producing light, another source of light is generally required, as either a source of bright white light and/or heat. When placing the various heating and lighting elements, they need to work together. Place the UV lights and the basking light on the same side of the enclosure, or the reptile might spend its time basking and be too far away from the UVB lamp to reap its benefits.</p>",979
34,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-sugar-glider-diseases-4117608,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>5 Common Sugar Glider Diseases</h1>,"<h1>5 Common Sugar Glider Diseases</h1><p>Both an exotic pet and a ""pocket"" pet, Sugar gliders arepopular in the U.S. and around the world, though some states and countries don't allow them to be kept domestically. These soft, small marsupials are super-cute, but they are also prone to myriad diseases.</p><p>By staying proactive through exotic pet research and by forming a relationship with an exotic veterinary team, you can help keep your sugar glider healthier and happier for longer. Take your glider in for annual check-ups, as small pets like sugar gliders often hide their illness until they are very sick. Early detection of a disease could be a lifesaver for your pet.</p><h2>Metabolic Bone Disease </h2><p>Also referred to as nutritional osteodystrophy, metabolic bonedisease is more commonly seen in pet reptiles, but it is also a major problem in pet sugar gliders. Both reptiles and sugar gliders need calcium in their diets in order to maintain proper bone strength. When sugar gliders do not get enough calcium and vitamin D3 in their food, their bones become soft due to the imbalance of vitamins and minerals in their tiny little bodily systems. Then come the secondary problems, including heart disease, seizures, pneumonia, and of course broken bones.</p><p>Thankfully, this disease can be diagnosed by your exotics vet, who can check the bone density and provide a nutritional consultation. The condition can usually be reversed with calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation and diet correction. Medications to treat secondary problems may also be prescribed. To avoid broken bones, cage rest is recommended for all sugar gliders with a metabolic bone disease until the bone density has improved.</p><h2>Sugar Glider Ick </h2><p>In aquariums, ich, ick, or white spot diseaseis well-known and much-feared. Ick in sugar gliders, though, is a little different than the aquatic version. Although both versions are due to tiny parasites called protozoans, sugar glider ick is caused by the protozoanwhile the fish version is caused by thevarietyis found in the intestinal tract of sugar gliders and, in combination with stress, causes diarrhea and poor coat quality.</p><p>Although there's not much known about sugar glider ick, aggressive treatment should be delivered by an exotics vet as soon as it's suspected. Malnourishment and dehydration occur quickly in these tiny animals, so any diarrhea or change in the coat quality of your sugar glider should not be ignored. Ick is diagnosed with a fecal sample to look for the microscopic parasites or by sending it out to a laboratory for special testing.</p><p>Preventing this disease is difficult because it's not understood where sugar gliders pick up the protozoan, and it is very contagious between sugar gliders. To avoid contaminating another sugar glider, wash your hands before and after handling an animal to lessen the likelihood of transmitting the disease.</p><h2>Skin Infections </h2><p>Sugar gliders are susceptible to many different kinds of bacterial skin infections, but is the most common. Infections can be secondary to other diseases, such as self-mutilation, or they can be acquired from dirty enclosures, fecal matter buildup, substrate/bedding harboring bacteria, or fungal spores. For example, corn cob bedding is a major culprit of fungal infections. Debris can easily get stuck in a sugar glider's soft coat, but they often bathe themselves or other members of their colony to help keep it clean.</p><p>Make sure your sugar glider's enclosure is clean, bedding is washed, and their food and water are changed daily to prevent any type of skin infection. Antibiotics or antifungals prescribed by your exotics vet may be given to help treat the infection. If your sugar glider is starting to look unkempt or smell, consider misting them with warm water or using a grooming wipe meant for petsto help them bathe.</p><h2>Self-Mutilation </h2><p>Some people forget about mental health when it comes to diseases, but sugar gliders are affected by a mental disease just like many people. Self-mutilation is usually caused by extreme stress in pet sugar gliders and can cause tremendous damage, not only cosmetically but also through open wounds and infections. Self-mutilation may start as simply as over-grooming or excessive licking to pulling out hair and then eventually turn into chewing skin off to create open wounds. These wounds can get infected and, if left untreated, can cause your sugar glider to become septic and even die.</p><p>Self-mutilation is a serious mental disease, but it can be prevented by offering an appropriate home with as little stress as possible to your sugar glider. Gliders live in large colonies of other gliders in the wild,which offer sources for communication, bonding, foraging, sexual activity, and other activities. Pet sugar gliders should always be housed with at least one other glider, if not a group of them, to help limit the likelihood of behavioral problems, stress, and development of diseases.</p><h2>Bone Fractures </h2><p>Sugar gliders love to jump and glide from place to place, but a home doesn't always allow safe places for this behavior to be fully exercised. Curtain rods are popular places for sugar gliders to perch and survey their world if they are given free run of a room, but the places they choose to glide to and land aren't always forgiving on their little bones.</p><p>Fractures, or broken bones, occur far too often in pet sugar gliders because of their curious behavior and natural instincts to glide. Create a safe place for your glider to explore and glide to prevent bone fractures but still allows them to play and jump. Soft landing areas like pillows, blankets, and tumbling mats are great options for rooms that have already been sugar glider-proofed for exploration. Additionally, be aware of what is available in that room for them to climb onto and jump off of. Inside your sugar glider's cage make sure there are no items that your pet can get their leg stuck in.</p>",964
35,https://www.thesprucepets.com/popular-types-of-hamsters-5199954,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>5 Most Popular Pet Hamsters</h1>,"<h1>5 Most Popular Pet Hamsters</h1><p>If you're not quite ready to take the plunge into pet ownership with a dog or cat, a smaller companion, such as a hamster can often be a good first step. These tiny rodents are considered to be low-maintenance pets, although as with any animal, it's important to know how to properly care for your new pet, from the supplies you'll need to how to feed them. Hamsters are very popular pets for kids and with good reason they live for a couple of years, are often happy to be housed alone, and their food/supplies are readily available at pet stores. (Not to mention, they take up minimal space in your home and don't make a whole lot of noise or mess).</p><p>But what may first-time hamster owners don't realize is that hamsters actually come in a wide array of colors and breeds, which all have their own distinctive traits. Here are five of the most popular hamster breeds to help you choose which is the right fit for your family. </p><h2>Chinese Hamster </h2><p><p>The Chinese hamster is a small, more rare hamster breed that isn't as likely to be found at your neighborhood pet store as some of the other hamster breeds. They grow to only about four inches long, and are often mistaken for dwarf hamsters due to their miniature size.</p><p>Often referred to as Chinese striped hamsters or Chinese dwarf hamsters, they are native to the deserts of China and Mongolia and often have a longer tail than other hamster breeds. The Chinese hamster is typically docile and easy to tame, although like other hamster breeds they can be skittish and will bite when startled.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>LENGTH: 4 inches</p><p>WEIGHT:1-2 ounces</p><p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Brown with a black stripe on their back, stomach is a lighter color</p><h2>Roborovski Hamsters </h2><p><p>There are actually several varieties of dwarf hamsters, and they are easy to find in pet stores. Also known as the Russian Dwarf hamster (or the ""Robo""), the tiny Roborovski hamsters are native to the desert areas of both Northern China and Mongolia. They are named for Lieutenant Vsevolod Roborovski, who popularized the breed back in the late 1890s.</p><p>These hamsters are so popular in part due to their tiny size; they won't take up a lot of room in your home. They can start off a bit shy and nervous, but generally warm up once they're comfortable with you and that's when their energetic, friendly nature will start to shine through.</p><p>Among one of several tiny species ofhamsters, the Roborovski hamster is social and easy to handle. They can differ from their larger (and often more territorial) relatives because they actually thrive when caged in pairs or groups. These docile pets are also quite entertaining. They like to tunnel and romp around their cage more than other hamster breeds, and they're easy to care for because their diet is readily available and they only require routine cage cleaning.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>LENGTH: 3-4 inches</p><p>WEIGHT:1 ounce</p><p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Distinctive white eyebrows and no dorsal stripe, fur is lighter behind the ears</p><h2>Syrian Hamster </h2><p><p>Most commonly referred to as either golden or teddy bear hamsters, the Syrian hamster is quite possibly the most popular breed of pet hamster. Thanks to selective breeding, you'll be able to find the golden/teddy bear hamster in an array of colors and coat lengths, and they can typically live between two to four years.</p><p>Along with its cuteness, the Syrian hamster makes one of the best pet hamsters because it's one of the easiest breeds to tame and handle. It's on the larger (and slower!) side, and it's generally quite friendly (and doesn't bite as often as some of the other breeds). The only downside is that they are nocturnal, and therefore rarely active in the day...so if you want to play or interact with your Syrian hamster, it's best to do it early in the morning or late in the evening. Though they are docile, they can be territorial, so they are best housed alone to avoid fighting.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>LENGTH: 5-9 inches</p><p>WEIGHT:Around 5 ounces</p><p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Usually found in golden brown and white but available in many other colors/coat lengths.</p><h2>Campbell's Hamster </h2><p><p>The Campbell's hamster is technically another variety of Russian Dwarf hamster, and they are native to China, Central Asia, and Northern Russia. They are somewhat less popular as pets because they can startle easily and tend to bite when they are scared.</p><p>Named for the biologist Charles William Campbell (he collected the first specimen in 1902), they also tend to have a shorter life span, most likely because they are susceptible to developing diabetes.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>LENGTH: 3 inches</p><p>WEIGHT:Around 1 ounce</p><p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:Gray-brown color with a white belly, furred feet, and dark dorsal stripe on their back</p><h2>Winter White Hamster </h2><p><p>Yet another breed of Russian Dwarf hamster, the winter white hamster is a beautiful snow-white variety that are found in Southwest Siberia and Eastern Kazakhstan. These make great pets because they are mellow, friendly, and sweet. Although they can be somewhat timid, they crave socialization and when given some time and patience they make affectionate and lovable pets.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>LENGTH: 3.5-4 inches</p><p>WEIGHT:.75-1.75 ounces</p><p>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS:White fur, round/oval body shape, furred feet and legs</p><h2>Hamsters to Avoid </h2><p>Although they're pretty low-maintenance, a hamster isn't going to be the right fit for every family. Homes that have dogs or cats that might be interested in munching on your hamster as an afternoon snack are probably not the best fit for these pint-size rodents.</p><p>Hamsters will also fare better in homes without very small children because they can be quite fragile. Families with kids may want to opt out of the dwarf species just because they are less likely to be able to tolerate a lot of handling. Another reason to avoid: They are also faster, more agile, and likely to escape or be injured if they manage to get loose in your home.</p>",960
36,https://www.thesprucepets.com/grooming-guinea-pigs-1238883,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,"<h1>Grooming Guinea Pigs: Nail Trimming, Brushing, and Bathing</h1>","<h1>Grooming Guinea Pigs: Nail Trimming, Brushing, and Bathing</h1><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>The grooming needs of short-haired guinea pigs are minimalbut if you have a breed with long hair, you will need to invest more time into caring for them. Regardless of their hair length though, all guinea pigs require regular nail trimming.</p><h2>How to Cut Guinea Pig Nails </h2><p>You can use human nail clippers or nail clippers designed for cats and other small animals. These look like little scissors with small notches toward the end of the blade for cutting the nail. Some people even use nail clippers meant for babies but nail clippers designed for dogs are too large.</p><p>Aim to clip your guinea pig's nails at least once a month, although you can do it more often if necessary. As the nails get longer, the blood vessel called the ""quick"" gets longer too and the nails will start to curl. Regular nail clipping helps keep the nails in good shape for walking and the quick at an appropriate length for trimming.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>The hardest part of doing anail trim on a pet guinea pigis trying tohold them still. With patience and practice, nail clipping will become part of your regular routine and your guinea pig will squirm less over time. When you are first starting out, have a helper hold your guinea pig and provide treats to be distracted with so that you can safely trim the nails. </p><h3>Sit Down and Hold Your Guinea Pig </h3><p>Place your guinea pig on your lap facing away from you with its rump against your stomach. This will keep your guinea pig from backing up. </p><p>Hold your guinea pig upright and onto its hind legs with its back against your body by placing your hand lightly around your guinea pig's chest. Make sure its hind end is supported either on your lap if you are sitting down or with your other hand. </p><h3>Secure the Body </h3><p>Gently wrap up your guinea pig's body and three of its legs in a light towel, leaving one leg free for clipping the nails. If you choose this method, be careful not to wrap too tightly so that your guinea pig can still breathe easily and take a break between legs to reduce stress and the chance of overheating. (If you have a particularly calm guinea pig, this step may not be necessary.)</p><h3>Choose a Paw to Work On </h3><p>With the hand you're using to hold the guinea pig to your chest, use two fingers to hold the guinea pig's exposed paw still.</p><h3>Clip the Sharp Tip of the Nail </h3><p>The trick withnail trims is to cut the sharp tip off the nail without cutting into the quick. If you cut into the quick the nail will bleed and it will hurt your guinea pig.</p><p>If your guinea pig has light or translucent nails, the quick will be visible as the pink part inside the nail. Make your cut in front of the quick, towards the end of the nail. If you cut too close to the quick it may still be painful for your guinea pig.</p><p>If your guinea pighas dark-colored nails, you can sometimes guess where it's safe to cut based on the shape of the nail, although this takes practice. The tip of the nail is usually quite narrow and may almost appear hollow when viewed from the bottom. Otherwise, it is safest to just clip off about 1/4 inch of the nail tip. </p><h3>Repeat on All Paws </h3><p>Shift the towel and how you're holding your guinea pig to expose a different paw. Clip the nails. Repeat until all paws on are. Give your guinea pig breaks as needed. </p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you have any doubts about trimming your guinea pig's nails, have a groomer, veterinary team member,or other experienced owners demonstrate a nail trim before you attempt it on your own.</p><h3>Dealing With Accidents </h3><p>No matter how careful you are, at one point you may accidentally cut into the quick and cause bleeding. Don't panic if this happens.</p><p>Make sure the bleeding has stopped before placing your guinea pigback in its cage or leaving itunattended.</p><h2>Brushing </h2><p>Regular brushing will help keep your guinea pig's coat in good condition.</p><p>The need for brushing depends on how long your guinea pig's hair is and whether your guinea pig is shedding excessively.</p><p>Long-haired guinea pig breeds should have any mats combed out every day. If you have a hard time managingthe long coat, the hair can also be trimmed to more easily manage.Simply trim the longer hair so it's not dragging on the ground using hair scissors or see a groomer for advice.</p><p>Short-haired guinea pigsneed only be brushed about once a week but if they are shedding and losing more hair than usual, brush them at least every other day.</p><h2>Bathing a Guinea Pig </h2><p>Bathing is quite stressful for guinea pigs but thankfully there are only a few reasons why your guinea pig would ever need to get a bath.Unless your guinea pig gets lice, gets urine or feces on its fur, or is about to be in a show or other competition, you'll probably never have to bathe it if you brush it regularly. If you do give your guinea pig a bath, use a shampoo designed especially for guinea pigs. Otherwise, use a mild unscented, non-medicated shampoo that is safe for use on kittens.</p>",905

While they are usually healthy animals, there are a number of diseases that commonly affect pet guinea pigs. By knowing what the most common illnesses are, you can be better prepared to monitor for signs and symptoms that your guinea pig may be getting sick.</p><h2>Signs and Symptoms of Common Guinea Pig Ailments </h2><p>All guinea pigs are different and even the five most common health ailments can present differently in different animals. It is important to note any change in behavior, appetite, elimination (urination and defecation), or other daily habits. Be aware of physical changes such as hair loss, skin redness, or swelling. Monitor any changes and speak with your veterinarian if you suspect there might be something off with your pet guinea pig.</p><h2>Ileus </h2><p>Guinea pigs should always be eating and defecating. If you see your guinea pig hasn't touched its food and you are seeing fewer and smaller stools being passed, your guinea pig may have ileus. Ileus is caused when gas builds up in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines). Due to the lack of normal peristalsis and no food coming into the digestive system, gas is unable to leave the body. This causes discomfort and can actually be life-threatening. Your guinea pig should receive immediate medical attention if you suspect ileus, so it can get a diagnosis and be prescribed the proper medications.</p><p>Ileus can be caused secondarily by an underlying illness or stressor which, in turn, causes your guinea pig to stop eating. Monitor food intake and be aware of how any changes may have impacted your pet.</p><h2>Ectoparasites </h2><p>If your guinea pig has hair loss and is itching or scratching a lot, it may have lice or mites. The thought of having these things in your house much less on the guinea pig may make you itch all over. Lice or mites can be easy to avoid and treat. Lice and Demodex mange mites are conditions that can both cause itching and hair loss. Lice and their eggs are usually seen in the bald patches behind your guinea pig's ears and the mites can be seen microscopically all over the body. Speak with your veterinarian if you suspect any of these parasites to determine the best course of action.</p><p>Guinea pigs can give these parasites to each other and can also get them from toys and bedding. Be aware before introducing any new guinea pigs if they seem to have any skin conditions. Before introducing food or bedding into the cage, make a habit of freezing it for a day. The extreme cold temperatures will kill off any potential parasites that may have been lurking in the packages.</p><h2>Uterine and Ovarian Diseases </h2><p>Spaying your female guinea pig is definitely recommended. If she is living with a male, this will ensure population control and prevent multiple litters of guinea pigs. Besides preventing babies, females often develop uterine and ovarianissues, including various cancers, and having your female spayed can prevent these issues. Sometimes the uterus and ovaries can be removed even after the problem has been discovered but other times cancer has already spread to other parts of the body, rendering it untreatable. A completeovariohysterectomy can be performed by your exotics vet on your guinea pig to prevent uterine and ovarian diseases, just as it would in a dog or cat. While some guinea pig owners are not able to justify the cost of the procedure, others see the great benefit of having their guinea pigs longer and not having to pay for emergency treatment when they notice their pig is sick.</p><h2>Respiratory Diseases </h2><p>Guinea pigs are sensitive to cold air drafts and can easily develop an upper respiratory infection or even pneumonia if you have a baby guinea pig. They can even get Bordetella bronchiseptica from your dog, cat, or pet rabbit. Take notice of your guinea pig's cage location and be sure to keep them away from drafts, open doors, and open windows. This simple act will help decrease the likelihood of them getting a respiratory infection. Wash your hands after handling other animals, including guinea pigs at pet stores, your dog or cat if they are coughing or sneezing, and even your rabbit. If you or your family are feeling ill, it's best to keep your germs to yourself.</p><h2>Uroliths </h2><p>More commonly referred to as bladder stones, uroliths often form in the bladder of pet guinea pigs. They cause pain and discomfort in your pet and you may also notice that their urine is often bloody due to the irritation the stone causes. If you notice infrequent urination or bloody urine, call your veterinarian right away and they will do some tests to determine the cause. Bladder stones are often found on radiographs being taken for a diagnosis of ileus and must be surgically removed.</p><h2>Disease Prevention </h2><p>Guinea pig ailments can be hard to diagnose. The best way to keep your guinea pig healthy is to keep a close watch on your pet. Make sure it is eating and defecating, wash your hands before and after handling, freeze your pet's bedding and food before use, and keep it away from drafts. These actions will help you prevent the bulk of the most commonly seen diseases, though there are, of course, numerous other diseases that affect guinea pigs. To rule out anything else or to look for internal issues, an annual physical examination with your exotics vet is always recommended.</p>",932
38,https://www.thesprucepets.com/the-first-month-with-your-hamster-5101157,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>The First 30 Days With Your Pet Hamster</h1>,"<h1>The First 30 Days With Your Pet Hamster</h1><h2>Plan ahead and you'll have less stress and more fun with your new furry friend.</h2><p> </p><p>The first 30 days with your hamster is a big time of transition for your little pet. To minimize stress and help them settle in more comfortably, there are practical steps you can take on the run-up to their arrival and during this first month. Let's take a look at the first 30 days, what to expect, and what you can do to help your hamster feel at home.</p><h2>Before Bringing your Hamster Home </h2><p>With some advance planning, you'll be ready to care for your hamster the right way from the very beginning.</p><p>First, ensure you have a suitable spot in your home for your hamster to live. While you don't want them shut away in a room with no company, it is just as important that your hamster's cage is not right in the middle of all the action. Hamsters are nocturnal creatures, so daytime is mostly nap-time. It is good for your hamster to be a part of the family, but too much noise and commotion can create a stressed animal.</p><p>Make sure you have purchased all the necessary equipment and that it is all set up in advance of their arrival. You don't want to delay getting your hamster into their new space or be fiddling with things while they are in it on day one - they will already be stressed enough</p><p>You'll need a suitably-sized cage that is equipped with all the necessary supplies including high-quality hamster food, bedding, nesting areas, exercise areas, hamster toys, and safe chews</p><p>Have you thought about names for your hamster? While it's not necessary before bringing your new pet home, this is a fun activity to keep the children involved in the process</p><p>You might want to research local vets and pet sitting service during this time too.</p><h2>First Day </h2><p>When you first get your hamster home, the family will no doubt be eager to interact and bond with them. However, it is best to leave your hamster alone for the first few days. Remember, they were just taken away from their comforts and safe areas, so they will likely be nervous.</p><p>It may even be best to cover the cage with a thin sheet during this time. Doing this will help avoid overstimulating your hamster.</p><p>After the first few days, you may periodically approach the cage and talk to your hamster in a calm, kind voice. This will help your pet become accustomed to your presence.</p><p>If possible, provide your hamster with the same food they have been eating. If you are planning on switching your hamster's diet, do so slowly and gradually. Starting them out on the same food they are acclimated to will minimize the chance of causing stomach upsets.</p><h2>Day 10 </h2><p>By now your hamster will likely have made themselves at home in their cage, and also be more comfortable with the surroundings and activities of your house. If you have been switching your hamster's diet, they should be fully adjusted to their new food by now.</p><p>At this point, you can begin focusing on handling and getting acquainted with your hamster. The first and most important step in taming your hamster is to build trust. Be patient and don't be discouraged if it takes longer than expected before your hamster wants to venture over to your hand or out of the cage that has become their safe place.</p><p>Start by placing your hand in the bottom of the cage, with your palm up and fingers relaxed. Give your hamster the opportunity to come over and check you out. They may lightly nibble your fingers as part of his explorationbe sure that you don't jerk your hand back suddenly or yell, which may startle your hamster. Consider offering treats from the palm of your hand to encourage them and build positive associations.</p><p>In time, your hamster will see your hand as a friendly presence in their environment. When they begin to step onto your hand, progress to putting both hands in the cage with your palms up. Then gently scoop up your hamster to hold them. Only aim for a minute or two in the beginning and keep handling sessions short and positive. If your hamster squeals or becomes anxious, return them to their safe space.</p><p>Avoid grabbing or forcing your hamster to come out, as this will only break the trust.</p><h2>Day 30 </h2><p>By day 30, you will better understand your hamster's routine, personality, and preferences. With patience and diligence, you will be able to win your hamster's trust. You may even have a hamster who willingly jumps into your hand! However, don't be too discouraged if you haven't reached this point. Remember, hamsters are small, vulnerable animals. In the wild, they have to be very cautious so it is only natural for them to be cautious around you as well.</p><p>Now that you are getting to know your hamster better, you can better choose activities and treats that you know your hamster will enjoy. Perhaps your hamster likes to run a marathon on their wheel. Or maybe they like to roll around the house in a hamster ball.</p><p>With a little preparation and forethought, you can help make the first 30 days with your new hamster as stress-free and successful as possible. Keep in mind that every hamster is different, so it may take a shorter or longer period of time than outlined here before your hamster is comfortable in their new surroundings. Being patient and working with your hamster is worth the reward of bonding with your new furry friend!</p>",931
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reptile-worms-1239380,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Worms or Parasites That Can Get Your Reptile Sick</h1>,"<h1>Worms or Parasites That Can Get Your Reptile Sick</h1><h2>Potentially Harmful Amoebas, Protozoans, Flagellates, and Worms</h2><p>Reptiles, like horses or other pets, may have worms or intestinal parasites that may not cause any issues and keep the gut healthy.</p><p>But when a reptile is sick, such as is not eating well, is losing weight, or is not defecating normally, there may be too many of these normal parasites for your reptile's system. When the worms and your reptile seem to have a peaceful relationship, then there is no need for alarm.</p><p>If your reptile is found to have intestinal parasites and it starts acting sick or having problems, then you will need to get your pet to an exotic animal veterinarian to see what's going on and if intestinal parasites are the problem.</p><h2>How Do I Know If My Reptile Has Worms? </h2><p>You may see worms passing in your reptile's stool but, more often than not, you will not see any kind of worm. Many intestinal parasites that people commonly refer to as ""worms"" aren't worms at all. Amoebas, protozoa, flagellates, and other kinds of microscopic parasites are more commonly seen under a microscope than actual worms.</p><p>The only way to know for sure what kind of parasites your reptile has is to look at a sample of their stool under a microscope. Your exotic animal vet will perform a fecal stain, direct smear, or fecal flotation (or all three) to find out if your pet has a parasite problem. If these tests come back positive, then the vet may prescribe appropriate dewormers or other medications to alleviate the infestation.</p><p>Even if you think your pet is fine, at least once a year you should take your reptile to the vet to have it looked at, this should include a fecal check.</p><h2>Types of Intestinal Parasites </h2><p>There is a long list of possible kinds of parasite your reptile can have or be infected with. Some cause a problem (in larger quantities) while others can be completely normal for your pet to have (in smaller quantities). Your reptile should only be treated for the parasites if it exhibits health distress or if the parasite populates outside of the ordinary amount.</p><h2>Cryptosporidium </h2><p>The two most common ways that your reptile can get this infection is if you offer water that is contaminated with this protozoan, or if you feed wild caught prey items that have . Cryptosporidiosis was previously considered a zoonotic disease; however, it now appears that some, but not all, of the species commonly found in reptiles do not affect mammals.</p><p>It causes terrible diarrhea and weight loss, as do most intestinal parasites. It does not produce a worm that you will see in the feces. Infection with this type of coccidia protozoan does not offer a good outcome for most pet reptiles and typically cannot be seen under a normal microscope. If you or your vet suspects a cryptosporidium infection, a special test should be performed to check for it.</p><h2>Pinworms </h2><p>Also known as the threadworm or seatworm, this is a common kind of nematode worm that you cannot see with the naked eye. It can be completely normal for your reptile to have pinworms since they typically contract them from eating infected mice or insects. Your vet may not treat your reptile for a pinworm infection unless it is causing a problem for your pet, such as a decrease in appetite or a fecal obstruction. People can also get these worms passed on to them through reptiles, so it is always important to wash your hands after handling a reptile.</p><h2>Amoebas </h2><p> This is another microscopic parasite that is transmitted through contaminated drinking water or contaminated food. It will cause problems such as vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and even bloody stools. It can only be seen microscopically.</p><h2>Coccidia </h2><p>A very common parasite in pet reptiles, this protozoan does not always show up in fecal samples. It does not always shed eggs to visualize, so it can be difficult to diagnose but can be safe for your reptile to have in small numbers (unless it is , which is more serious). A stressful situation may cause it to overpopulate and cause an issue for your pet.</p><h2>Roundworms </h2><p>These worms can actually be visualized in the feces of your reptile. They look like long spaghetti-like worms and are easily treated by your exotics vet.</p><h2>Hookworms </h2><p>You will not see these worms in your reptile's feces, but they usually cause bloody stools due to the nature of the parasite. These worms ""hook"" onto the lining of your reptile's intestines causing the blood you see in the stools. They are typically easily treated.</p><h2>Tapeworms </h2><p>These little worms look like pieces of rice. They may be connected to form a worm or, more commonly, you may just see the rice-like segments of the worm in the stool. Like most other parasites they can cause weight loss.</p><h2>Flagellates </h2><p>Parasites like giardia are a kind of flagellate. Reptiles can harbor many kinds of flagellates, most of which are normal in small amounts. But if your reptile is showing any symptoms of a parasitic infection, your vet may prescribe a dewormer.</p>",900
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/is-a-hamster-the-right-pet-for-you-5095798,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Is a Hamster the Right Pet for You?</h1>,"<h1>Is a Hamster the Right Pet for You?</h1><p>Ricky Kharawala/ Unsplash</p><p>Who isn't taken by a hamster's large, shiny eyes, fluffy appearance, and tiny toes? No wonder the hamster is a popular and well-loved small rodent pet. However, there are some misconceptions and often unknown facts about hamsters that you should consider before heading to the pet store to pick one out. Keeping in mind these important things will help you decide whether a hamster is the right pet for you.</p><h2>Activity Level </h2><p>One important thing to consider about hamsters is that they are nocturnal. Many people picture an active little creature running around their hamster wheel and keeping them company throughout the day.</p><p>In reality, daytime is generally nap time. Of course, you will still see your hamster throughout the day, but this isn't when they are most active.</p><p>If you are a light sleeper, you may want to consider where in the house you will keep your hamster, so any late-night play sessions don't keep you awake.</p><p>If you are a night owl, these little guys make perfect late-night companions.</p><h2>Cage and Space Requirements </h2><p>Though young hamsters are commonly seen in groups at pet stores, most mature hamsters are territorial and require their own cage. If you happen to have a female hamster who gives birth, it is extremely important to give her and her young a calm, separate space. A stressed or disturbed hamster mother may kill or eat her babies.</p><p>Certain species, such as some dwarf hamsters, can live together as long as they are properly introduced.</p><p>The cage should also be sufficient size to allow for separate sleeping, exercise, feeding, and toileting areas.</p><h2>Cleaning Requirements </h2><p>Keeping your hamster's cage clean is important for both you and your hamster's health. However, you don't want to clean it so often that it disturbs your new friend.</p><p>Cleaning the cage weekly is advised. Be sure to always wear gloves and thoroughly wash your hands afterward.</p><p>Other cleaning tasks include keeping your hamster's bathroom area clean and wiping out food and water dishes or bottles. Tidying up your hamster's bathroom area is best done daily, while food and water dishes and bottles are best done during the weekly clean. Remove soiled bedding and replace with fresh bedding as needed.</p><p>Every once in a while, taking the cage completely apart and cleaning it with soap and water will help keep the enclosure clean and free of any smells.</p><h2>Supplies and Cost </h2><p>Though the price of purchasing the hamster itself is relatively small, the cost of owning a hamster does not stop there. When calculating the costs, be sure to consider all of the supplies and items required to properly house and care for a happy hamster.</p><p>These include, but are not limited to, a cage, bedding material, nesting area, exercise wheel, tunnels and toys, water bottle, food dish, food, and treats.</p><p>If your hamster ever gets sick or has health problems, you'll also need to consider the potential of vet bill costs. Conditions like wet tail, respiratory infections, diarrhea, and abscesses all require a vet's attention.</p><h2>Children and Hamsters </h2><p>Though often viewed as a perfect pet for young children, their small size and cute features don't necessarily mean this is true. Children often have the potential of squeezing, dropping, or startling these fragile creatures. This can lead to a scared hamster, and nervous or startled hamsters may bite. It is always best to have adult supervision anytime a child is playing with a hamster and to gradually and positively introduce them to gentle handling.</p><p>Another thing to consider is the hamster's nocturnal nature. Many children want a fuzzy friend to play with after school, but this is usually a hamster's time to sleep. Waking the hamster from their nap could cause them to feel grumpy, startled, or insecure with their surroundings.</p><p>In addition to the above reasons, hamsters are little, fast creatures and have the potential of getting lost. A hamster on the run can get into trouble or be harmed by getting stuck under furniture, chewing wires, or getting injured by other pets.</p><p>Avoid this possibility by providing a hamster ball for your pet to zoom around in. Not only will it keep your hamster safe, but also it will provide a fun way to burn off some energy.</p><h2>Diseases and Health Concerns </h2><p>Hamsters can be carriers of different diseases and viruses, such as and lymphocytic choriomeningitis. Both can be transferred to humans.</p><p>The best way to protect yourself from getting sick is to make sure you wash your hands after handling your hamster or when conducting routine tasks like feeding or cleaning the cage. This should definitely be stressed with children, too.</p><p>According to the CDC's direction for avoiding the transfer of salmonella from rodents, you should avoid washing your hamster's food and water bowls, toys, or cage in an area used for food preparation. Instead, wash these items in a utility sink, laundry room, or outside.</p><h2>Life Expectancy </h2><p>Hamsters usually only live for about two years. The pain of losing a pet so quickly is definitely something to keep in mind before deciding to add a hamster into your home.</p><p>Hamsters make wonderful, entertaining companions, but they may not be suited for every situation. Keeping in mind their activity levels, cage and cleaning requirements, life expectancy, and potential problems can help you determine whether adding a hamster to the family will be the right decision.</p>",884
41,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchilla-eye-diseases-1238228,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Eye Problems in Chinchillas</h1>,"<h1>Eye Problems in Chinchillas</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Chinchillas are members of the rodent family that have been traditionally farmed for their exceptionally soft and thick fur, but are now often kept as pets. These nocturnal animals are somewhat shy but are quiet, odor-free, and friendly if they are socialized while still young.</p><p>After their fur, the next thing you are likely to notice about a chinchilla is its large, dark, beautiful eyes. These lovely eyes are usually problem-free, but occasionally you may run into an issue with them which will warrant a visit to your exotics vet. Like most animals, chinchillas can get eye infections or small scratches on their eyes, both of which cause watery eyes and pain. And as with many rodents, it is possible for your chinchilla's teeth to grow so long that they interfere with proper tear drainage. Any of these conditions require veterinary attention to relieve your pet's pain and restore its good health.</p><h2>What Are Eye Problems? </h2><p>Chinchillas are fairly easy to care for and not exceptionally prone to diseases, but like any animal, they can occasionally suffer from ailments, including problems with their eyes. Bacterial infections are a common cause of eye issues in rodents, particularly if their cage is not kept clean. Fungi can also cause eye infections. Trauma to the eye from rough play, a sharp object in the cage, or a mishap can leave a scratch on the chinchilla's cornea. And overgrown teeth are a common cause of weepy eyes in rodents.</p><h2>Symptoms of Eye Problems in Chinchillas </h2><p>Like many small animals, chinchillas can hide signs of illness quite well. This is a defensive mechanism that in the wild would help prevent them from being targeted by a predator. You should examine your pet daily, looking for any signs of illness, including problems with its eyes.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Eye ailments generally hurt, and you are likely to see signs of pain in your pet chinchilla should it develop an eye problem. You might notice it pawing or rubbing at its eyes, or rubbing its face along the side or bottom of its cage. Often, you'll see watery or goopy discharge coming from one or both eyes, and the skin around the eye might look slightly swollen or reddened. The eye itself might look cloudy, or you might actually be able to see a scratch or injury on the surface of the eyeball. Usually, just one eye will be affected, but occasionally, you'll see signs of trouble in both eyes.</p><h2>Causes of Eye Problems </h2><p>There are several causes of eye problems in pet rodents in general, including chinchillas.</p><h2>Diagnosing Eye Problems in Chinchillas </h2><p>Your exotics veterinarian may diagnose your pet's problem just by physical examination, including a close examination of the animal's teeth and eyes. Occasionally, a swab of eye secretions might be sent to the veterinary lab for culture. This test is performed to determine what specific bacteria might be causing a suspected infection.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Most eye problems will resolve with medication, but occasionally surgery may need to be performed. Treatment will vary based on the type of eye problem and the severity of the issue.</p><p>Corneal ulcers are usually treated with medicated eye ointments prescribed by your vet. Some of these ointments are antibiotics and some are made specifically to heal ulcers and relieve pain. If the ulcer refuses to heal, however, a procedure called a grid keratotomy may necessary to encourage healing. This procedure is done under anesthesia and involves the use of a needle to make small scratches on the eye. These scratches encourage healing by uncovering healthy tissue underneath the ulcerated tissue.</p><p>If your chinchilla has an eye infection, your vet will prescribe antibiotic eye ointments or drops. If the infection doesn't clear up, however, your vet might order a culture and sensitivity test, which determines not just the specific bacteria causing the infection, but also which antibiotics will kill that particular bacteria. These results allow your vet to pick the correct treatment for your chinchilla.</p><p>Overgrown teeth and tumors that affect the eyes will typically require surgery to treat the problem. Tumors unfortunately may not be able to be removed completely, but teeth can be extracted. Medications to treat various symptoms including pain, pressure, and infections are often used as well.</p><h2>Prognosis for Chinchillas With Eye Problems </h2><p>With treatment, your chinchilla should be feeling and acting better within a few days to a week or so.</p><h2>How to Prevent Eye Problems </h2><p>You can't always prevent your chinchilla from developing eye problems, but you can greatly reduce the chances of these health issues by keeping your pet's cage clean, changing bedding frequently, and taking care to remove anything sharp or dusty that might irritate your chinchilla's eyes.</p><p>If you think something is wrong with your chinchilla, you should make an appointment with your exotics vet as soon as possible. Chinchillas often stop eating and develop ileus if they do not feel well or are in pain. This means that their intestines stop moving digested food through their system normally, causing painful gas.</p><p>Catching an eye issue before it causes other problems is important to your chinchilla's overall well-being and eye health.</p><p>Rodent Dentistry. . </p><p>Corneal ulcers: More than just a scratch. .</p><p>Control of Parasites and Fungal Infections in Small Pet Mammals. .</p>",875
42,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rat-tumors-1238498,Small Pets > Pet Rats,<h1>Tumors in Rats</h1>,"<h1>Tumors in Rats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Tumors are relatively common in pet rats, and they can contribute to rats' relatively short lifespans. These growths, which can be malignant or benign, can occur in various places on a rat's body. Some cause pain or impede rats' daily activities. Because these animals are beloved by their owners for their friendliness and intelligence, early detection and treatment of tumors are critical. Treatment, primarily surgery, may help keep a rat more comfortable or extend its life.</p><h2>What Is a Tumor? </h2><p>A tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal tissue on a rat's outer body or internal organs. Tumors can range from less harmful benign cysts or lipomas (fatty tumors) to life-threatening cancerous tumors.</p><p>Tumors can develop on the skin of a rat where they are visible or internally where they may go unnoticed for some time.</p><h2>Symptoms of Tumors in Rats </h2><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Depending on the location, your rat's movement may be impairedwhich can lead to lethargy, poor appetite, and weight gain from a growing tumor.</p><p>Some tumors may cause an increased appetite in your pet rat. However, a rat that eats a lot of food but gains little to no weight may be experiencing a nutritional offset where the intake of nutrients is directed toward the growth of the tumor.</p><p>Brain tumors usually cause neurological symptoms as well as bulging eyes and a misshapen head due to tumor expansion. Rats with brain tumors may be ataxic and have problems getting around or appear wobbly.</p><h2>Mammary Tumors </h2><p>These are fast-growing and hormone-dependent tumors that respond to both estrogen and prolactin stimulation. They are most often seen in female rats that are not spayed, and malignancy is likely.</p><h2>Lipomas </h2><p>Also known as fatty tumors, lipomas are pockets of fat tissue that can surface on any part of a rat's body. They are rarely cancerous but may grow large enough to require removal.</p><h2>Cysts </h2><p>Male rats are the most prone to developing cysts. Cysts are not considered tumors (unless it is a cystadenoma), but they look and feel like tumors. They are often found on a male rat's back near its sebaceous glands. Cysts can pop up from a simple skin infection or ingrown hair. They are usually quite firm and do not grow as large as a lipoma or mammary tumor.</p><h2>Brain Tumors </h2><p>Both benign and malignant brain tumors can be caused either by the presence of cancer or by an abnormality in the pituitary gland.</p><h2>Causes of Tumors </h2><p>Physiological/genetic and environmental factors (such as poor breeding or exposure to carcinogenic toxins) can contribute to the development of tumors, but no one knows exactly what initiates the abnormal growth of tissue in every case.</p><h2>Diagnosing Tumors in Rats </h2><p>Different types of tumors may be more obvious than others. Some tumors grow quickly and are easy to spot, while others are hidden internally and may go unnoticed until your rat starts having trouble getting around or seem painful when picked up.</p><p>After discovering a tumor, a veterinarian will perform a physical exam, x-rays, and/or ultrasounds to determine the shape and invasiveness of the tumor. A biopsy may also be required to find out if the tumor is cancerous.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Some growths may be small and manageable without surgery, but most tumors in rats get so large that they need to be removed due to the small size of the animal.</p><p>Mammary tumors and large lipomas are often surgically removed, especially if they are suspected to be cancerous or causing ambulation issues in your rat. Some growths are difficult to completely remove and regrowth is common.</p><p>Cysts are usually lanced, allowing fluid to ooze out. Cysts need to be watched for infection and can regrow, leading to later surgical removal.</p><p>Brain and certain types of cancerous tumors are inoperable in rats. Yet, some types of cancer can be treated with drugs like Tamoxifen (for estrogen-sensitive cancers), and supplements like turmeric and shark cartilage are reported to stunt a tumor's growth.</p><p>Rats with severe health issues, however, should be euthanized once their quality of life is compromised.</p><h2>Prognosis for Rats with Tumors </h2><p>The prognosis depends on the type and size of the tumor in a rat. Operable tumors may be removed, offering increased comfort and mobility, but many tend to regrow. Invasive cancerous tumors are often inoperable and may quickly impact a rat's quality of life.</p><h2>How to Prevent Tumors in Rats </h2><p>While there is no guaranteed prevention of tumors, feeding a rat a nutritious, low-fat diet may help prevent cancerous tumors in some rats. Several studies also show a decrease in mammary tumor formation in rats fed a diet high in miso, a soybean product. In addition, spaying or neutering your pet rat may help reduce the likelihood of it developing cancerous breast or reproductive organ tumors.</p>",779

Choose an active hamster that doesn't look like it has a wet rear end or watery eyes. Both eyes should be open and, ideally, the hamster will be eating or running around the cage. If a cage seems to have a few sick hamsters, it is probably best to avoid buying any hamster from that group since hamster diseases are very contagious.</p><p>Choosing a hamster that is easy to tame is another factor to consider. Young hamsters will be easier to train and hand-tame than older hamsters, who may have had bad experiences or have never interacted with humans.</p><h2>Hamster Cages and Supplies </h2><p>There are many hamster cage options available both online and at pet stores but some cages are definitely better than others. Several cages may look cool, but aren't very functional and are extremely difficult to clean (cages with colorful tubes are a good example of this). Fish tanks aren't good options for hamsters either, since they lack proper ventilation. You may also have to consider that smaller hamster breeds have different cage needs than the larger Syrian varieties, since cage wire spacing can determine whether or not a hamster is able to escape. Choose a cage that has good ventilation, is easy to clean, has space for a hamster to run and explore, and won't allow your hamster to escape.</p><p>Inside the hamster cage you'll need to provide soft and absorbent bedding, awater bottle, an exercise wheel, chew toys, a house, and food dish. Keep in mind that hamsters like and need to chew on items so wood, cardboard, plastic, and other items that are able to be chewed may not last very long inside the enclosure.</p><h2>Feeding Hamsters </h2><p>Most people assume that a store-bought bag of hamster seed is what is best for a hamster but they actually need a variety of proteins, fruits, and vegetables to keep them healthy and happy. Hamsters may pick and choose what they want to eat from seed mixtures and therefore will not receive a balanced diet.</p><p>But if you offer a pelleted diet instead of a seed mixture and supplement it with a variety of other safe foods, you will be providing your hamster with everything it needs to thrive. Greens are a good option to offer daily; parsley, kale, romaine, peas, and squash are all good options. Your hamster's diet should be made of 75 % fortified pellets, 20% veggies, greens, and fruits, and 5 % treats.</p><p>It's also a good idea to provide hay in your hamster's environment to help with nesting and foraging. Most hamsters will also eat the immature seeds in the hay.</p><h2>Hand-taming Hamsters </h2><p>Hamsters can be tamed to be very sweet little pets but for anyone who has ever been bitten by one, they know hamster bites definitely aren't fun. Young hamsters are typically easier to hand-tame, but you can start teaching your hamster not to bite by making sure you don't startle it. Try not to wake it up, and instead entice it to climb onto your hand on its own using a tasty treat. This will allow you to gain your hamster's trust over time, and allow you to pet and hold your hamster while avoiding being bitten. Hamsters are not aggressive pets but if they are scared or startled they may bite.</p><h2>Toys for Hamsters </h2><p>Hamsters need to be active and have enrichment so they don't get bored and overweight. They also need chew toys to keep their teeth neat and trim. There are a variety of hamster toys that are designed to be chewed so your hamster's teeth can be properly cared for, and an exercise wheel will allow a hamster to run as much as they want. Special balls can also be purchased to allow a hamster to run around safely outside its cage; cute houses and other climbable options are available to provide your hamster with ample exercise.</p><h2>Breeding Hamsters </h2><p>Hamster breeding is not something the casual hamster owner should do. It is best left to hamster breeders who are breeding for specific qualities and temperaments but accidents do happen. Many unsuspecting new hamster owners find themselves with a pregnant hamster after purchasing it from a pet store. Extra food and a quiet nesting area inside the cage need to be provided to a pregnant hamster.</p>",893

In captivity, though, a restless rabbit's need to chew can quickly become destructive. A rabbit that's wandering around looking for things to chew may ingest stuff that's bad for it if left to its own devices for too long. To help keep your rabbit from chewing on everything in sight and potentially getting sick in the process the key is to teach it what's appropriate for chewing and what's off-limits.</p><h2>Why Do Rabbits Chew? </h2><p>There's a biological reason for rabbits' constant chewing. Their teeth grow continually all their lives, and in the act of chewing, the teeth wear against each other, which keeps them trimmed.</p><p>In captivity, the main reason rabbits chew on things that aren't appropriate is boredom. If a rabbit spends a lot of time alone or doesn't have much stimulation, it seeks ways to entertain itself and/or get attention from its owner. Chewing on things is an easy way to accomplish both.</p><p>Given their biological urge to chew, rabbits in the wild nibble on a range of plants and grasses and burrow in their natural habitats. In captivity, rabbits still have the urge to chew, but how destructive they are is a combination of what they can get their paws on and how they've been trained.</p><h2>How to Stop Inappropriate Chewing </h2><p>Because your rabbit needs to chew, provide a variety of safe, chewable items. Branches from apple or willow trees, safe rabbit toys, untreated willow baskets and toys, untreated grass mats, and cardboard all make good chew toys for rabbits.</p><p>Providing multiple playthings gives your rabbit more choice, which can also help to keep boredom at bay. If you have different sizes and types of chew toys around, chances are that least one of them will satisfy your rabbit's craving to chew. Remember to provide your rabbit with a couple of safe chew toys in its cage as well.</p><h2>Rabbit-Proof Your Home </h2><p>Good rabbit-proofing takes away much of the temptation and opportunity for your rabbit to get into trouble. Don't give your pet free run of your home, at least not at first. Instead, designate a limited space and thoroughly rabbit-proof that space to make training easier.</p><p>Things like electrical wires are very dangerous for your rabbit, so you have to make sure there's no way your rabbit can get to them. Keep cords safely tucked out of the rabbit's reach, and use PVC cord protectors or tubing sold at hardware stores for cords that run along the floor. Furniture and other belongings should also be protected. The less your rabbit can demolish, the less frustrated you'll be and the more smoothly training will go.</p><h2>Supervise and Redirect </h2><p>Your rabbit doesn't instinctively know that it's not allowed to chew on your furniture and other belongings, so you must teach it. When you're starting out with a new rabbit, this means that you must watch it carefully at playtime.</p><p>Make sure you start this training as soon as you bring your rabbit home so there's less opportunity for bad habits to develop. Whenever your rabbit tries to chew something it shouldn't, say ""no"" firmly (there's no need to yell) and clap your hands; then give it an appropriate chew toy.</p><h2>Get a Second Rabbit </h2><p>Destructive rabbits are often soothed by the presence of another rabbit. It's not a good idea to pair two unaltered (not spayed or neutered) rabbits, though. If you pair a male and a female, you're likely to get more rabbits; if you pair two males, they may fight. Two unaltered females may get along fine, but the best option is to pair either two neutered rabbits or an unaltered rabbit with a neutered rabbit of the opposite sex.</p><h2>Spay or Neuter Your Rabbit </h2><p>Having your rabbit ""fixed"" is likely to erase much of its destructive behavior. You'll still need to provide plenty of toys that it can safely chew, but the rabbit will be much more chill about inappropriate chewing.</p><h2>Try Rabbit Repellent Sprays </h2><p>You can try applying abitterapplespray(available at most pet stores) on inappropriate items that yourrabbitlikes to chew. Manyrabbitsdon't mind the taste, though some even seem to like it so this may be worth a try but isn't usually effective.</p><p>Avoid using any toxic chemicals in areas where your rabbit is likely to chew. Even though a chemical such as ammonia or bleach may act as a repellent, if your rabbit ingests it, it could prove to be harmful or fatal, depending on the chemical and how much was ingested.</p><h2>Be Patient </h2><p>Your rabbit will take its time to learn and will probably test you along the way, so be patient but consistent. Never hit or yell at your rabbit. If it keeps going back to your things instead of chewing on its own toys, put your bunny in a ""timeout"" in its cage for a few minutes. Another alternative is to put your rabbit in an exercise pen (a collapsible, portable cage for dogs) for at least part of its playtime outside the cage, so you can relax on the supervision and training for a bit.</p><p>As your rabbit gets older and more settled, its chewing will become less of an issue, but consistency and patience right from the beginning are your biggest training advantages.</p>",884
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-hermit-crab-is-out-of-shell-1239085,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Shell Evacuation in Hermit Crabs</h1>,"<h1>Shell Evacuation in Hermit Crabs</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Shell evacuation isn't necessarily an indication that something is wrong with your hermit crab. These popular pet crabs periodically abandon their shells as they grow and move into bigger ones. However, stressful situations may cause untimely shell evacuation, and a homeless crab is an unhappy crab. Without a shell, a hermit crab is more vulnerable to the outside environment; its exoskeleton will get too dry, and the crab will become lethargic. Crab owners can help their pets find new homes before their health declines.</p><h2>What Is Shell Evacuation? </h2><p>Shell evacuation happens when a growing crab needs to ""trade up"" both its housing and its exoskeleton to accommodate its larger body size. This is a normal process called molting and is not a cause for concern. But, not all crabs that abandon their shells are molting. Stress, an inhospitable environment, a poor-fitting shell (too large, too small, too heavy), fungus, or uninvited company can all cause a hermit crab to leave its shell. When this happens, the homeless crab suddenly becomes exposed to its surroundings, which is bad for its health.</p><h2>Symptoms of Shell Evacuation in Hermit Crabs </h2><p>If your crab is molting, you may notice that it looks pale, gorges on food, tries to climb the glass walls of its habitat, or stays near its water source. These are pre-molt behaviors. If you notice any of these signs, and your crab's environment is clean and uncrowded, watch to see if your crab sheds its shell and exoskeleton within a few days.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The symptoms of stress-induced shell evacuation differ from those of molting in that they indicate ailing health or a problem that can be identified (such as fungus growing inside the crab's abandoned shell). These symptoms may not be immediately recognizable upon evacuation, so watch your crab closely for a couple of days to determine the cause of evacuation and the need for intervention.</p><h2>Causes of Shell Evacuation </h2> <h2>Diagnosing Shell Evacuation in Hermit Crabs </h2><p>There is no official diagnostic process or testing to determine the cause of shell evacuation, but observing your crab and evaluating its molting stage and habitat conditions will help you figure out what's going on with your homeless hermit crab.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>When a hermit crab is out of its shell, it's stressed and vulnerable. Your crab needs protection from the other crabs in the habitat, as well as a little coaxing so that it will return to its shell.</p><p>Protect your hermit crab by moving it to an isolation tank or sectioning off a portion of its habitat. The isolation area should have food, water, and about six inches of substrate so that your crab can bury itself and complete its molt if needed. The molting cycle can take up to one month.</p><p>An empty shell selection, including several different sizes, should always be available in the habitat to promote easy transfer to a new hermit home. </p><p>Fungal or bacterial infections are usually self-limiting and go away after a molt.</p><p>Leave your crab alone in a dark habitat for a few days. The peace and quiet will, eventually, help it feel secure enough to try on another shell.</p><h2>Prognosis for Crabs with Shell Evacuation </h2><p>Evacuated hermit crabs will fare just fine if given the proper environment, time, and shell availability to choose a new home. But, if a stressed crab does not receive attentive care to improve its environment, then its health may fail, and the crab could die.</p><h2>How to Prevent Shell Evacuation </h2><p>You can prevent unwarranted shell evacuation by carefully caring for your crab and its habitat. To do so, make sure your hermit crab enclosure has ideal humidity levels (between 70 and 80 percent). Humidity is critical to hermit crab health, as moisture helps them breathe through their modified gills. A hygrometerwill help you assure your levels are on target. Also, mist your crab a few times a day with warm distilled water to moisten the gills on the sides of its body.</p><p>The hermit crab habitat also requires a strictly regulated temperature range between 72 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Maintaining this temperature will allow the substrate in your tank to hold a similar temperature gradient, keeping your crabs warm when they burrow.</p><p>To prevent fungal and bacterial infections, make sure your crab's environment has ample airflow, always feed it fresh food, and remove any uneaten food before it grows mold. Clean and maintain both the substrate and the water regularly to prevent the growth of mold or algae.</p><p>Some crabs are quite particular about the shape of the opening and the style of the shell, so try to provide slightly larger shells with the same style as that of their prior home. Before placing the new shells in the habitat, wash them and brush off any debris, sterilize them for 15 to 20 minutes in boiling water, dry them, and then make sure there are no foreign objects lodged inside. After the shells are clean, mist them with a mixture of de-chlorinated sea-salted water, and place them in the tank with your isolated crab.</p>",846

It can be very challenging to care for one in a household. There are more than 350 species of primates hailing from habitats in Asia, Africa, and the New World. Of those primates, only seven are usually kept as pets. Review some quick points about owning capuchins, chimpanzees, and more. And, take a look at some significant considerations before you bring one home.</p><h3>What's Not So Great About a Pet Monkey</h3><h2>Major Considerations Before Getting a Primate </h2><p>If you are thinking about adopting or buying a pet primate, there are a few things you need to know before you finalize your decision. Overall, primates do not make good pets, and larger ones like chimpanzees are one of the worst household pets.</p><p>The cost of a primate, whether it is a smaller monkey like a capuchin ($7,000) or a great ape like a chimpanzee ($70,000), is expensive. But, mounting costs like a lifetime supply of food, diapers, and veterinarian bills can be astronomical.</p><p>All primates are a potential risk to you and your family. Even if you raise the animal from birth, it is still a wild creature that can lose control at any minute and harm you. Smaller monkeys may become aggressive, bite you, or become destructive in your home or their enclosure. Larger monkeys and chimps have a potential for greater damage, personal injury, or even death. While there are some cases where a monkey is well-trained and lives out its entire life without causing harm, the risk is too high in most cases.</p><p>Most primates are long-lived creatures, and despite looking huggable, they are not cuddly creatures. They require a substantial amount of your time every day and need large enclosures. In terms of space requirements, even some zoos with large naturalistic enclosures are under fire for not providing ample space. Though some of the animals can live in enclosures that are 30 square feet or more, some never acclimate well to life in an enclosure.</p><p>Monkeys or apes need a varied, fresh diet, and several hours of daily enrichment and interaction with you. If these needs are not addressed appropriately, the animal will become lonely or depressed and can get aggressive.</p><h2>Capuchin </h2><p>The capuchin is a New World monkey that often appears in television or movies as the hat-and-vest-wearing monkey that collects money from street performances. These long-lived monkeys (average life span is 40 years) are highly intelligent, mischievous, and territorial. Smart as they are, they never learn to use the toilet and need diapers for their entire life span.</p><h2>Chimpanzee </h2><p>Although people have kept chimpanzees as pets, it is not recommended; they can be aggressive. Chimps are not monkeys. Technically, they are great apes native to the forests and savanna of Africa. Humans do share the most DNA in common with this species; however, chimps are large, strong, and can overpower humans when it comes to brute strength. Chimps have mauled and even killed humans. This species also lives long about 60 years in captivity and requires diapers if it is outside of its enclosure.</p><h2>Macaque </h2><p>Macaques are smaller monkeys that hail from Asia. They can get up to 40 pounds and can live up to 30 years. They also need to wear diapers throughout their lifetime. They need a large, secure cage so they don't get lost in your house or run outside and climb up electric poles. Even though these are smaller primates, they require massive enclosures that are at least 30 square feet.</p><h2>Tamarin </h2><p>Tamarins are tiny New World monkeys that weigh less than a pound but will live about 15 years in captivity. Despite their small mouths, they can still give nasty bites. They need a very secure cage with small bar spacing; if not, they will escape or get stuck in the bars. For an indoor cage, you can house one in a 7-feet square enclosure. But, they will need access to a larger outdoor enclosed space for highly needed vitamin D for their growth and development.</p><h3>What is a Pocket Monkey?</h3><p>Monkeys like Tamarins and Marmosets are sometimes called pocket monkeys, because they're small enough to fit in your pocket.</p><h2>Squirrel Monkey </h2><p>Squirrel monkeys are acrobats. They live up to 25 years, use their tails to hang on branches, and need a lot of space and hanging branches for clinging and moving around. They will also wear diapers for their entire life. They have extensive dietary requirements and require a wide variety of foods.</p><h2>Marmoset </h2><p>Similar to tamarins in size and housing requirements, marmosets are squirrel-like monkeys from South America. Their natural diet is insects, fruit, tree sap, and other small animals. They are quick, scampering creatures that are not suited to handling. These are generally not suited as pets for their particular diet and UV light needs.</p><h2>Guenon </h2><p>These 10-pound monkeys hail from the forests of sub-Saharan Africa and can live up to 25 years in captivity. Guenons are also high maintenance. There are almost two dozen species of guenons; the green monkey, vervet, and grivet are the most popular species kept as pets. They thrive in large groups. To keep this animal as a pet, you would need to keep a troop of them.</p>",876
47,https://www.thesprucepets.com/head-tilt-in-rabbits-4021111,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Head Tilt in Rabbits: Causes and Treatment</h1>,"<h1>Head Tilt in Rabbits: Causes and Treatment</h1><p>If your pet rabbit has a head tilt, it is most likely caused by an issue in the ear or brain. Figuring out what exactly is the cause of the tilt can be a little bit challenging. There can be a few explanations for why your rabbit is suddenly cocking its head to one side or the other, but regardless of the why, your rabbit will need to see a veterinarian if you see a head tilt.</p><p>Here are possible reasons for a head tilt in your rabbit, including ear infections and calcium crystals.</p><h2>Other Symptoms to Monitor </h2><p>It can be easier to decipher what the cause of the head tilt is from with other accompanying symptoms.</p><h2>Possible Causes </h2><h3>Rabbit Head Tilt from Ear Infections </h3><p>Your rabbit can get an ear infection in one or both ears. The infection can be due to bacteria, yeast, or sometimes a mixture of both and it can also cause a head tilt in rabbits.</p><p>Your vet will take a sample of the debris in your rabbit's ear (it may just look like wax), smear it on a glass slide, stain it, and look at it under a microscope to see if there is an infection. Topical medications (ear drops) are usually prescribed to treat ear infections in rabbits.</p><p>If the ear infection is really bad or has been left untreated for a long period of time, the head tilt may remain even after the ear infection has been treated. Some head tilts may remain long term but rabbits may benefit from physical therapy to help retrain and strengthen their neck muscles.</p><h3>Rabbit Head Tilt from an Abscess </h3><p>Rabbits are very prone to developing localized infections called abscesses. They can get them just about anywhere in or on their body, and if an abscess is in the area of the ear canal, they may cause a head tilt. Tooth abscesses, abscesses behind the eye, or abscesses under the skin by the ear may all put pressure on the ear canal, causing your rabbit's equilibrium to be off and give them a head tilt. Depending on where the abscess originates, it may require antibiotics or surgery to remove it.</p><p>If an abscess is due to a bad tooth in your rabbit's mouth, it will need to be extracted under anesthesia. The abscess may also be filled with antibiotics, surgically opened to allow it to drain, and cleaned out. Abscesses are not fun to deal with. They can be very difficult to get rid of and no one likes to give medications to their pets.</p><h3>Rabbit Head Tilt from Ear Mites </h3><p>Ear mites are tiny little pests that make their homes in the ear canals of many kinds of animals. Rabbits are prone to be infested by these arachnids, and when ear mites are feeding on the ear wax in your rabbit's ear, it can be very loud, painful, and annoying to your rabbit. These side effects of the ear mites may cause your rabbit to tilt their head, shake their head, scratch at their ear, and rub their head on the ground in an attempt to stop the pain and annoyance.</p><p>Ear mites are usually pretty easy to get rid, of but you need to make sure a medication that is safe for rabbits is used. If the wrong medication is used, you could cause such harm as deafness, pain, and even death to your rabbit. Ear mites can be easily seen under a microscope by your vet and typically once the infestation is cleared up the head tilt will go away.</p><h3>Rabbit Head Tilt from Calcium Ear Crystals </h3><p>These crystals or stones are called otoconia and are not able to be visualized with the naked eye but can develop in the ear canal of a rabbit and cause head tilt. The head tilt can be so severe that a rabbit is unable to stand up and may just lay on the ground or even roll. These calcium crystals can be dislodged with targeted manipulation of the head or may move on their own over time. When the crystals dislodge, the rabbit's head tilt may suddenly disappear.</p><h3>Rabbit Head Tilt from E. Cuniculi </h3><p>Historically thought of as the primary reason for a head tilt, , more often referred to as , is actually unlikely to infect and cause problems in your rabbit in the United States. According to Dr. Karen Rosenthal, a renowed exotics veterinarian, author, and educator, there is no test to determine an active infection and even if a rabbit was infected, the disease is understood to affect a part of the brain that would not result in a head tilt. Tests that are available are antibody, not antigen, tests and only indicate exposure to the protozoan. Head tilts are more likely caused by ear infections, mites or calcium crystals than .</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Courses of treatment for any of the above should always begin with a visit to the veterinarian. Head tilts can improve with proper treatments, time, and physical therapy but your veterinarian will be needed to properly diagnose your rabbit.</p>",868

Some of these animals can endanger human lives while others simply fail to thrive when removed from their natural habitats. Even when raised in a home from a young age, these animals tend to maintain their wild instincts, making them unpredictable and difficult to manage. Here are 10 animals that do not make good pets.</p><h3>Watch Now: Top 10 Animals That Don't Make Good Pets</h3><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you spot a wild animal in need of help, resist the urge to adopt it as a pet. Instead, contact a certified wildlife rehabilitator to get the animal the care it needs.</p><h2>Primates</h2><p>Lemurs, capuchins,chimpanzees, and baboons all fall into theprimate category. They are cute and childlike,but they also act like babies, permanently, with all the messes and screaming included. The biggest problem with pet monkeys is they are prone to rampages without warning. And as they can possess shocking levels of strength while lacking reason, chances of effectively controlling them are slim. They also might bite their owners, which is especially scary given that they can transmit diseases, such as hepatitis A and HIV-1.</p><h2>Big Cats</h2><p>Cougars, lions, tigers, and leopards make up the majority of large cats people opt to keep as pets. They are strong and dangerous to say the least. If you think you can just declawa catto make it less of a threat, think again. Declawing removes the entire last bone in each toe, which can cause an animal to walk improperly and result in tremendous pain and nerve damage. Moreover, large cats also kill their prey by biting the throat. If the teeth don't kill you, their crushing jaw pressure will.</p><h2>Venomous Snakes</h2> <p>Venomous snakes can kill you with a single bite,and antivenom can be hard to come by. Some cobras also can cause immense pain and blindness just by spitting their venom into your eyes. Thus, extreme safety measures must be taken if venomous snakes are kept in a home. If they do escape, you not only are endangering the lives of your family but also your neighbors. There are plenty of pet snakes available that do not produce venom, so stick with the safer species.</p><h2>Bears </h2><p>Despite the fact that bears can weigh over 1,500 pounds when fully grown, some people still feel they can be like cute, cuddly pet teddy bears. Yes, bear cubs are adorable,but they don't stay small for long. They soon will tower over you when standing on their hind legs, and they can knock you over, or even kill you, with a swift blow from a paw.</p><h2>Coatis</h2><p>The coati (pronounced ko-wot-ee and sometimes referred to ascoatimundi)is a member of the raccoon family. Originally from South America, these omnivores require a large enclosure to roam. They are extremely active and difficult to train. They have 38 to 40 sharp teeth, forage for their food, and require a lot of mental stimulation. Even though many are kept as pets, they are still wild animals that can deliver a pretty nasty bite.</p><h2>Bats </h2><p>What carries rabies and SARS, has sharp teeth, sleeps all day, and flies all night? Bats. They are extremely cute and intriguing, but appreciating them in the wild is best. Bats can live over 30 years and hibernate for months in colder climates. Plus, their diet consists of insects, fruit, or blood at night (depending on the species), which is difficult to adequately provide in captivity.</p><h2>Wolves and Coyotes</h2><p>Wolves and coyotes are not domesticated dogs. They act on their instincts, hunt when they are hungry, play when they want to, and sleep the rest of the day. If they feel threatened, they will attack, and they can kill an animal several times their size. Furthermore, though wolfdogs have some popularity as pets, they are not much different from their pure wolf cousins and also should be avoided.</p><h2>Kinkajous</h2><p>Smaller than their coati cousin, kinkajous only reach around 7 pounds but still have very sharp teeth and a high activity level. They also are nocturnal creatures and are known to be aggressive on occasion. They especially do not like being woken during the day and can emit quite a scream and attack by clawing and biting their owners. For a small animal, they can do a lot of damage to a person.</p><h2>Alligators and Crocodiles </h2><p>The American alligator can reach over 14 feet in length and kill prey as large as cattle. Most homes cannot accommodate such a predator. These animals can cause serious infections from bites, knock you down or break your legs with a whip of their tail, and kill you with their bite force of around 2,000 pounds. You also don't want to be around a male gatorduring mating season.</p><h2>Foxes</h2><p>With the exception of the tiny fennec fox(or the domesticated silver/Siberian fox), foxes are not recommended as pets. Red foxes can become very tame but never fully trustworthy. And they will bite if they feel threatened. They also have a musky odor that is far worse than a ferret. Also, most states will destroy pet foxif a bite is reported because there is no vaccination protocol for the animal.</p>",864
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/eye-problems-in-hamsters-5095745,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Eye Problems in Hamsters</h1>,"<h1>Eye Problems in Hamsters</h1><p>When looked after well, hamsters don't usually have a lot of health problems, but occasionally an issue may arise. An eye problem is one such issue and it should not be ignored. Knowing what kind of eye problems hamsters commonly get, how to recognize them, and what can be done about them can help keep your hamster comfortable and fully sighted.</p><h2>Types of Eye Problems in Hamsters </h2><p>A few of the most common types of conditions or problems hamsters can develop with their eyes are outlined below. Of course, if you spot any problematic signs that an eye is injured or uncomfortable, it is always best to seek advice from a veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h3>Conjunctivitis </h3><p>Also known as pink eye, conjunctivitis occurs when the pink tissues around your hamster's eyes become inflamed and irritated. An infection is often also present which can cause heavy eye drainage as well as crusting around the eyelids. Trauma from the cage or another hamster, dental issues, and dirty environments can all cause a hamster to get conjunctivitis.</p><h3>Ulcers </h3><p>A corneal ulcer occurs when the eye gets scratched or irritated. Bedding rubbing on the eye and injuries from the cage and other hamsters are the most common causes of ulcers in hamsters. The eye may look cloudy and your hamster may be holding it shut or rubbing it regularly. It is a painful and often progressive problem that should not wait long to be addressed.</p><h3>Proptosis </h3><p>This emergency situation occurs when the eye comes out of the eye socket. It usually happens when a hamster is squeezed too hard. This might be through rough handling, accidental stepping on, or even through a dog or cat attack.</p><h2>Diagnosing Eye Problems in Hamsters </h2><p>In order to diagnose what type of problem your hamster has, a veterinarian may need to examine it. Special eye drops, stains, lenses, and lights may be used depending on what kind of eye problem is suspected. Of course, some problems, like proptosis, may be obvious.</p><p>Occasionally, a swab of any debris that is present around the eye will be examined for bacteria under a microscope. If bacteria is present and your veterinarian needs to know what kind it is, a culture may be performed.</p><h2>Treating Eye Problems in Hamsters </h2><p>If your hamster's eye problem needs to be cleaned before treating it, you can use a warm, wet cloth to gently wipe away debris. Saline eye drops or artificial tears can be used to rinse and lubricate the eye as well. Once the eye is clean and open, most problems will require topical medications but some may also need oral medications or even surgery.</p><p>If your hamster is diagnosed with conjunctivitis or an ulcer, your veterinarian will most likely prescribe medicated eye drops or an ointment. These topical medications are usually applied to the eye once or twice a day for one to two weeks. Occasionally oral medications like antibiotics and pain medications will also be needed depending on the type of eye problem.</p><p>Proptosis may involve the surgical removal of the eye but this will depend on the level of trauma and how far the eye is protruding from the socket. Sometimes the eye is able to be gently pushed back into place by your veterinarian.</p><p>The procedure to remove the eye is called an enucleation and, encouragingly, hamsters can continue to have a good quality of life with just one eye.</p><h2>Preventing Eye Problems in Hamsters </h2><p>While not all eye problems are preventable, there are some simple care considerations that can help to minimize the risk, especially when it comes to cage hygiene and handling.</p><h3>Cage and Environment Cleanliness </h3><p>Cages should be kept clean and free of dust and extra care. Some types and brands of bedding are dustier than others and the extra dusty ones can send tiny particles into the air that irritate your hamster's eyes. Rooms that are dusty from home remodeling projects or other reasons can also cause issues. Because of this, a clean environment is ideal not only for protecting your hamster's little eyes but its overall health, too.</p><h3>Correct Handling </h3><p>Children that hold hamsters too tightly may cause proptosis in hamsters. To avoid this, supervised, gentle handling should be enforced at all times. Restraining a hamster too tightly or even innocently hugging a hamster a little too much can cause serious damage not only to its eyes but to other parts of its body as well.</p><h3>Management Around Other Pets </h3><p>Dogs and cats should also never be left alone with a hamster to avoid serious injuries and even death.</p><p>Aggressive hamsters can also result in trauma to the eyes of other hamsters. Hamsters generally are better kept as individual pets. If fights between pairs or groups of hamsters are regular, or you suspect a hamster is being bullied, permanent separation may be the safest and fairest option.</p><h3>Dental Care </h3><p>Finally, monitor your hamster's teeth as overgrown or irregular teeth cause problems. Providing adequate and appropriate items to chew on (not the bars on the cage), a good diet, and taking an occasional peek at those chompers can help prevent issues not only in the eyes but elsewhere.</p>",851
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-tumors-1239350,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>5 Kinds of Rabbit Tumors</h1>,"<h1>5 Kinds of Rabbit Tumors</h1><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>There are several different types of tumors that can grow on a rabbit. Sometimes these tumors can be a problem but other times they are simply unsightly. It is important to know which type of tumor a rabbit does or doesn't have so a rabbit owner can take all the necessary steps to keep their rabbit safe and healthy.</p><h2>What Is a Rabbit Tumor? </h2><p>A tumor is a growth or mass that develops in or on a rabbit. Tumors are a collection of cells that grow abnormally and create a lump. Sometimes these lumps contain fluid, fat, cancer cells, blood, and other things, but they are not always bad. Some tumors are benign and may not spread, while others are malignant and do spread to other parts of the body.</p><h2>Rabbit Lipomas </h2><p>Lipomas are growths that are filled with fatty tissue. Rabbits don't typically get this type of tumor, but it's not unheard of. Lipomas can be found all over the body and, when squeezed, are usually softer or more ""squishy"" than other types of tumors. They are non-cancerous but can grow very quickly. The primary medical risk of lipomas is their size; they can grow so large they cause mobility issues in rabbits. If a rabbit gets a lipoma that is impeding its movement, your vet may recommend surgical removal of the tumor.</p><h2>Rabbit Cysts </h2><p>Cysts are pockets in the skin that are filled with cystic material (similar to a zit in humans). These can form all over the body of a rabbit and, when squeezed, are usually more firm than a lipoma. Sometimes an exotics veterinarian may be able to lance or pop the cyst and express the material inside it without sedating the rabbit, but other times more problematic cysts may need to be surgically removed.</p><p>Cysts are not typically an issue unless they rupture and become infected. When a cyst ruptures it is also painful for a rabbit, so this is not something that should be allowed to happen if at all possible. There is no medication that can be given to make a cyst go away, but antibiotics will be prescribed if there is a concern for infection.</p><p>Internal cysts, such as ovarian cysts, are not visible on a rabbit's exterior, but an exotics veterinarian may be able to either feel them during an examination or identify them on an X-ray. If a rabbit is not spayed it may be at risk for developing ovarian cysts. Just like in people, these are extremely painful if they rupture and surgery will be needed to remove them.</p><h2>Rabbit Abscesses </h2><p>An abscess is simply a pocket of pus. Pus is made up of bacteria and white blood cells and denotes infection in that area. Abscesses can look like a tumor or lump, but when it is popped the purulent discharge oozes out of it. A foul smell and pinkish fluid oozing from the mass are indicative of an abscess.</p><p>Abscesses can form on a rabbit from trauma or infection. They can occur anywhere on the body and should be treated immediately. A diseased or overgrown tooth, a wound, and other causes of infection can all result in abscesses. Abscesses can be very difficult to treat on a rabbit and also hard to find if they are internal. Sometimes surgical removal is the only way to get rid of a difficult abscess on a rabbit.</p><h2>Rabbit Cancerous Growths </h2><p>These are the most concerning type of tumors. Cancerous tumors can occur anywhere in or on the body of a rabbit, but they aren't always malignant. Sometimes a cancerous tumor is benign, which means it won't spread, so it can be surgically removed without further concern.</p><p>Cancerous growths can show up on a rabbit in multiple ways, but they often grow rapidly and, when squeezed, feel like firm lumps. Rabbits can get the same kinds of cancerous growths as dogs and cats. Tumors on bones, the skin, and internal organs are all seen in rabbits.</p><h2>Rabbit Myxomas </h2><p>These nodules occur in some rabbits that have certain strains ofchronic myxomatosis. A vaccine for this awful disease, which is typically transmitted through insect bites, is not available the United States.</p><h2>Treatment of Rabbit Tumors </h2><p>If a lump is felt on a rabbit, whether or not it is oozing, firm, soft, or pendulous, it should be examined by an exotics vet as soon as possible. If the growth needs to be surgically removed and there is a chance that it is cancerous, it needs to be taken care of sooner rather than later in case it is malignant. If medications are needed, they can also be administered as soon as possible to help a rabbit with a tumor. Not all lumps are bad, but by being proactive and getting each lump checked out, a rabbit owner can hopefully lengthen their rabbit's life and keep them as comfortable as possible.</p>",856
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/scorpion-species-1237307,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>8 Top Scorpion Species Suitable as Pets</h1>,"<h1>8 Top Scorpion Species Suitable as Pets</h1><p>Scorpions are quiet, clean, and fairly low-maintenance. The most common pet scorpions aren't particularly dangerous, especially compared to other scorpion species. Their stings are likened to those of a bee, though serious anaphylactic reactions can occur in some people. If you're interested in an unconventional animal experience, here are eight scorpion species that can be kept as pets.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Handling pet scorpions is not recommended. You might get stung or pinched, and your scorpion might injure itself by running away or falling. If you must move your scorpion, use a pair of long, foam-tipped forceps.</p><h2>Emperor Scorpion</h2><p>For beginners, the most universally recommended scorpion species to keep as a pet is the emperor scorpion This scorpion is fairly docile, and the venom of its sting only causes a mild, localized reaction in most people. Some say this scorpion is more likely to try to pinch you with its claws than sting you, but it typically won't become aggressive unless it feels threatened.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 6 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large body; shiny black or dark blue in color; bumpy, broad pincers</p><h2>Tanzanian Red-Clawed Scorpion </h2><p>The Tanzanian red-clawed scorpion is from the same genus as the emperor scorpion, though it is smaller than its popular cousin. It also tends to be more aggressive and willing to sting than the emperor scorpion, so it is not recommended for beginners. But its venom is mild like a bee sting. Red claws can live for around eight years in captivity.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Black body; rusty red coloring on claws</p><h2>Malaysian Black Scorpion </h2><p>The Malaysian black scorpion is a large, rainforest-dwelling species that is harder to find as a pet than the emperor scorpion. It also is more aggressive than the emperor scorpion and not ideal for beginners. It's prone to using its claws rather than stinging for protection. Its venom is mild, just causing localized pain and inflammation in most cases, which is why people still choose to keep it as a pet.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Shiny, black body; large claws</p><h2>Javanese Jungle Scorpion </h2><p>Native to the rainforests of Indonesia, the Javanese jungle scorpion can live for five to eight years in captivity. But it is fairly aggressive and territorial. These scorpions are most likely to protect themselves with their strong claws, and they also feature a stinger with mild venom. Unlike many other scorpion species, they can be kept in groups, though some might end up fighting.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Dark brown or black with a greenish tint; heavy build</p><h2>Desert Hairy Scorpion </h2><p>Desert hairy scorpions are found in the southwestern United States. As pets, they tend to be skittish but will assume a defensive posture if provoked. Their venom is more potent than that of the emperor scorpion, making a sting quite painful, so they are not recommended for beginners. These scorpions require a desert setup to their housing that includes a layer of coarse sand, as well as a rare misting.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Tan to olive green coloring; darker back; yellow claws, legs, and tail; brown hairs on tail</p><h2>Large-Clawed Scorpion </h2><p>Large-clawed scorpions prefer to use their powerful claws for defense, and they rarely sting. For most people, their venom is mildly painful but not dangerous. Native to Northern Africa and the Middle East, these scorpions are found in deep burrows in wild deserts. That environment is somewhat difficult to reproduce in captivity, as one must have the appropriate soil depth and moisture content.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 3 inches</p><p>Weight: Less than 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Brown back; golden to reddish-brown claws</p><h2>Dictator Scorpion </h2><p>The dictator scorpion is closely related to the emperor scorpion. It has an impressively large body and powerful pincers. But it's typically more timid than aggressive around people and will spend much of its time hiding in a burrow. Unlike many scorpions that must be housed individually, the dictator scorpion can coexist with other members of its species, except multiple males might fight.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Dark brown or black body; stocky build; broad pinchers</p><h2>Asian Forest Scorpion </h2><p>The Asian forest scorpion looks very similar to the emperor scorpion, though it's slightly smaller. It can be somewhat aggressive and territorial, and its sting is comparable to that of a hornet. But it's more likely to defend itself with its claws. This species is fairly hardy and can live up to eight years in captivity.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Dark brown to black body; stocky build</p><h2>Scorpions to Avoid </h2><p>Scorpions of the genus commonly known as fat-tailed scorpions should not be kept as pets. means ""man killer,"" and the stings of these scorpions contain potent neurotoxins that can kill a person. Moreover, scorpions of the genus commonly known as bark scorpions also can be life-threatening. And though they are less toxic, scorpions of the genus can have very painful stings.</p>",848
52,https://www.thesprucepets.com/obesity-in-rabbits-4138295,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Dealing With Obesity in Rabbits</h1>,"<h1>Dealing With Obesity in Rabbits</h1><p>Obesity is a problem no matter what species you are, including rabbits. Just like in humans, dogs, cats, and even birds, being overweight unfortunately plays a major part in the health of your pet rabbit and is considered a pet welfare issue.</p><h2>What Causes Obesity in Rabbits? </h2><p>Overeating is typically the reason for obesity in rabbits but this factor alone may not affect a very active rabbit. Rabbits need to take in more calories than they are exerting in order to pack on the pounds and since many pet rabbits are unfortunately caged for the majority of their lives, obesity is a common problem when they don't get the exercise they need.</p><p>Sugary treats are also contributors to the obesity problem in pet rabbits and are marketed as cute but the fact is your rabbit doesn't care what their food looks like. But many pet owners give in to the gimmicks and want to give their rabbits whatever the pet store has to offer.</p><p>Being stationary is the main culprit for obesity in every species. Rabbits are made to jump and run but too often we keep them contained in small cages or only allow them to hop and binky for short periods of time. This lack of energy exertion can create a multitude of problems for your rabbit and also gives them nothing to do but eat, sleep, and gain weight.</p><h2>How Can You Tell if Your Rabbit is Obese? </h2><p>Being obese means that your rabbit has more body fat than is healthy for their body size. Each rabbit species has a different set of breed standards that tell you what a normal size and weight of that particular breed should be. These standards should be used as a guideline to help you and your veterinarian judge whether or not your rabbit weighs an appropriate amount.</p><h2>Why is Obesity in Rabbits Bad? </h2><p>Obesity has been thought to be associated with many diseases included myiasis, pododermatitis, pregnancy toxemia, and even ileus (GI stasis), among other things. These diseases may also be caused by other things but no loving pet owner would ever want to knowingly contribute to making their rabbit sick.</p><p>Myiasis is more commonly referred to as a maggot infestation. Since overweight rabbits are unable to properly clean themselves they are more prone to having dirty areas on their body that attract flies (especially the rectum). Flies lay eggs that turn into maggots and if you aren't regularly checking and cleaning your rabbit these can easily go unnoticed. Secondary infections, unrepairable wounds, and even internal damage can be done by maggots.</p><p>Pododermatitis is known as bumblefoot and is often due to a sedentary lifestyle or an obese rabbit that is putting too much pressure on their feet. Contributing factors can be rough and unclean surfaces but inflammation typically starts due to the pressure on the hock and feet from an obese rabbit. Bumblefoot is painful and can be difficult to treat and clean and the first signs of it usually including limping.</p><p>GI stasis (ileus) is the most common problem in pet rabbits due to its many causes. Obesity by itself may not cause a rabbit to stop eating and develop ileus but because of all the other problems that can be associated with obesity, it is definitely a major player in the ileus game.</p><p>Obesity has also been thought to be a player in cancer in people so there also may be bigger consequences for our pet rabbits that we don't know about.</p><h2>What Can You Do to Prevent and Reverse Obesity in Rabbits? </h2><p>The obviously easiest thing to do to help prevent obesity in rabbits is to feed an appropriate kind and amount of food and provide ample exercise. Grass hay is vital to the health of your rabbit and should be the main part of their diet. Pellets and treats are usually the reasons for weight gain so these should always be limited in adult rabbits.</p><p>Healthy food items like fruits and vegetables can be reserved as treats and only offered when you want to give something special to your rabbit. Avoid sugary and fat filled foods like sunflower seeds yogurt drops from the pet store, and many kinds of cereals. Instead, reserve a strawberry or carrot as a special treat for your rabbit that they only get from you and they'll think it is just as good as a sugar cube.</p><p>Allow your rabbit to run around. Ideally, a rabbit is never caged but rather has a rabbit-proofed ""room"" or large penned area to live and explore. This will not only keep their mind stimulated but it will also keep them lean and happy. If you have no choice but to cage your pet rabbit then you can still give them time to exercise. Harnesses for rabbits are often used as playpens to make sure your rabbit doesn't get into an unsafe area. They should be allowed at least three hours of time to play and exercise if they are restricted during the day. Remember, rabbits run around several miles a day in the wild so the least we can do is let them play in our homes for a few hours.</p>",859
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-handle-and-tame-pet-hamsters-1238956,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How to Train Your Hamster to Be Tame</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Hamster to Be Tame</h1><p>Handling a small pet can be one of the joys of having it around, but not all pets enjoy being handled right away, including some new hamsters. Some hamsters need to be tamed before you can safely hold them. Thankfully there are a few tried and true steps you can take to get your hamster in your hands in no time at all. There are a few simple rules to follow to make sure your hamster is not stressed before you begin the training process.</p><h2>Let a New Hamster Adjust </h2><p>When you bring home a new hamster, give it a week or so to adjust to its new home and surroundings before you try to do much handling. Make sure your hamster has a good-sized cage and the other necessities for stress-free housing. Place your hamster's cage in a location where it will be around people but not disturbed by excess noise, other pets, and other distractions (especially during the day, when hamsters do most of their sleeping). Don't disturb or try to handle your hamster during the day when it is sleeping.</p><h2>Prepare Yourself and Your Hamster </h2><p>Taming a hamster requires time and patience. Don't rush through the steps.Take the time to get to know your hamster and respond to its cues. The key here is to earn your hamster's trust, so it can learn that there is no reason to be afraid of you.</p><p>Notice when your hamster has gotten comfortable in its environment. Work on taming and handling it only after it has emerged from its nest on its own. Signs of a relaxed hamster are that it is eating, drinking, and playing when you are present. Spend more time around your hamster's cage and quietly talk to it to get it used to your voice. If you don't know what to say, try reading a book out loud or singing softly.</p><h2>Coax Your Hamster With Treats </h2><p>Offer some favorite treats to your hamster from your hand. If you have a wire cage, start by offering treats through the bars of the cage. Otherwise, just offer them right at the edge of the cage door. Once your hamster scurries over for the treats, try putting your hand just inside the cage. Don't try to touch your hamster but rather let your hamster come over to explore your hand.</p><h2>Hold Your Hamster </h2><p>Place the treat on your open hand inside the cage so that your hamster has to take the treat off of your hand (and perhaps place a paw or two onto your hand to get the treat). Again, don't force this, but let your hamster come to you. Next, try placing the treat on your hand so that your hamster has to climb on your hand to get it. Once your hamster is bravely doing this (and only then), try to gently and slowly scoop it up. The first few times your hamster will likely jump right out of your hand, but just be gentle and persistent and eventually, your hamster will realize your hands are safe.</p><p>The time between steps varies, especially depending on the age of the hamster and your hamster's personality. Your hamster may quickly accept being picked up or take treats from your hand right away, or it may take a month or more to be relaxed enough to do so.</p><h2>Let Your Hamster Move Around </h2><p>The best way to pick up a hamster is cupped in the palm of your hand with the other hand over its back. It is best to begin picking your hamster up just above your lap or some other soft surface in case it falls or jumps.</p><p>As your hamster gets more comfortable, let it crawl from one of your hands to the other and over your arms. You can continue to offer treats, though your hamster may not be as interested in treats when there are new things to see and explore.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>There may be a time you need to pick up a hamster that hasn't been tamed yet, such as to clean its cage. To do this, place a cup (or cardboard tube with paper stuffed in one end to close it off) on its side in front of the hamster and gently herd it into the cup (or tube). Most hamsters will walk right into the cup out of curiosity. Gloves or a thick towel can be used if you must pick up a hamster that bites, and if thecup method hasn't worked. This can be really stressful and cause your hamster to resist handling even more, so if it is necessary to use this method, take extra care to be as gentle as possible.</p><p>If your hamster bites you while you are handling it, know that it didn't mean to hurt you. The hamster just felt threatened. Try not to overact by yelling or harshly moving the hamster. If you do, it will become scared of you. Instead, calmly place it back in its cage and wash the bite with soap and water.</p>",842
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-clean-hamsters-cage-5101164,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How to Clean Your Pet Hamsters Cage</h1>,"<h1>How to Clean Your Pet Hamster's Cage</h1><p> </p><p>Keeping your hamster's cage clean is important for ensuring they stay healthy and disease-free, as well as for your own wellbeing. Not to mention that it is better on your nose! Daily maintenance is the first step towards keeping a clean cage for your pet, but a weekly deep clean is also in order.</p><h2>Daily Cleaning </h2><p>Every day, spend a few minutes tidying up your hamster's bathroom area and providing them with fresh food and water. Hamsters are typically clean creatures and generally choose one or two areas in the cage to relieve themselves. This ""bathroom"" corner can easily be cleaned up. To do so, use a scoop or a gloved hand to reach into the cage and remove any soiled material and dispose of it in a bag. Replace what was removed with clean bedding material.</p><p>As for the water and food dishes, washing them daily is important since your pet is eating and drinking from them. By keeping these clean, you will prevent your hamster from ingesting contaminated food or water and it will prevent a build-up of harmful germs or bacteria from building up.</p><h2>Weekly Cleaning </h2><p>Every week, you will need to completely change all the bedding in your hamster's home to keep it clean and sanitary. While this deeper cleaning is usually only necessary once per week, you may need to do it more often if you notice a strong ammonia smell, the bedding looks more soiled than usual, or you are housing several hamsters together.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Hamsters can be carriers of transmittable viruses and bacteria such as salmonella and lymphocytic choriomeningitis. Because of this, it is important to always wear gloves while cleaning your hamster's habitat. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after completing daily or weekly cleaning tasks.</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3>Transfer Your Hamster to a Safe Place </h3><p>When you are ready to clean, move your hamster to a safe place outside his or her cage, such as a pet carrier or hamster ball. Your hamster will be less stressed and there is no chance of injuring your pet if it scampers by as you scoop up dirty bedding or replace a clean food bowl.</p><p>Gather your supplies in advance to save time and be sure you use safe cleaning solutions. You can find solutions specifically formulated for small pet habitats in your local pet store, or you can use mild soap and warm water. Never use full strength bleach!</p><h3>Empty the Cage </h3><p>Now remove all the bedding, disposing of the used material. Even if some of the bedding appears clean at first sight, it's best practice to weekly change all the bedding for a fresh start and clean habitat.</p><p>Also remove all food and water dishes, tunnels, wheels, and toys. This prevents any soiled bedding or food particles from remaining trapped underneath objects.</p><h3>Thoroughly Wash the Cage </h3><p>Give the empty enclosure a scrub with mild soap and warm water or cage cleaning solution. Instead of soap, you may also opt to wash the cage with vinegar, but be certain to thoroughly rinse any residue away when done.</p><p>Depending on the type of hamster cage you have for your pet, it may be helpful to take the cage apart. This allows you to deep-clean each section with ease and minimizes the hassle of trying to reach in through small doors or access points.</p><p>Set the cage aside to dry while you clean the rest of your hamster's set-up.</p><h3>Wash All Cage Accessories </h3><p>Cage cleaning is not complete until you have also washed all of your hamster's toys, wheels, tunnels, and dishes. This is important since urine, feces, and bacteria can be harbored inside the crevices of tunnels, underneath dishes, or on the surface of toys. Continued exposure to this sort of grime can lead to ear infections or eye problems.</p><p>Once washed, be sure to rinse each item to ensure that no soap or cleaning solution is trapped inside of the items.</p><h3>Dry and Reassemble the Cage </h3><p>Dry all pieces of the cage well. Leaving water behind may create soggy bedding or lead to mold developing. Once it is dry, reassemble the cage and fill it generously with new bedding.</p><p>You should provide your hamster with two to three inches of fresh, fluffy bedding. It is important to never use pine or cedar bedding as these materials can cause respiratory issues for your hamster.</p><p>Place the clean toys, dishes, tunnels, and wheels back inside the cage. Once cleaning is complete, return your hamster to his fresh, clean home.</p><h3>Dispose of the Soiled Bedding and Gloves </h3><p>Throw away all soiled bedding, along with any paper towels or disposable cloths you may have used in cleaning your hamster enclosure. Tie up the bag and discard. If you used rags, be sure to sanitize them before next use.</p><p>Always complete cleaning your hamster cage by thoroughly washing your hands.</p><p>A clean hamster cage makes for a happy, healthy hamster! By following this simple cleaning routine for a pet hamster's cage, you can keep your pet's home looking and smelling good. Bonus: Your house will smell better too!</p>",838
55,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-your-ferret-1236783,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>A Quick Guide to Ferret Food and Feeding Your Ferret</h1>,"<h1>A Quick Guide to Ferret Food and Feeding Your Ferret</h1><p>Ferrets have unique feeding requirements that are now finally being addressed by commercial pet food manufacturers, though with varying success.</p><p>Ferrets are obligate carnivoresand food passes through the digestive system of a ferret very quickly. Ferrets also lack the ability to derive nutrition from plant matter. For this reason, a ferret diet must be high in animal protein, high in fat, and low in fiber. All foods, including foods intended solely for ferrets, are not created equally, so be careful what you are feeding your ferret.</p><h2>Have Food Available at All Times </h2><p>Ferrets have a quick metabolism along with a short digestive system, so they need to eat frequently (usually every 3 to 4 hours). It is best to have food available constantly. Most ferrets will eat only enough to meet their needs and will not become obese if allowed constant access to good quality food. Fresh, clean water is also a necessity at all times. If you are having a problem with your ferret gaining too much weight, check with a vet to rule out a medical problem and for advice on meeting their diet needs while maintaining a good weight. Increased exercise is usually the best way to approach obesity once health problems are ruled out, rather than diet restrictions.</p><p>Dry foods are the most convenient choice for ferrets, as they can be left available at all times without concern of spoilage. Canned ferret food can be given as a treat or supplement, but only occasionally.</p><h2>Basic Requirements for a Ferret Diet: </h2><h2>Analyzing Processed Dry Foods </h2><p>Unfortunately, the nutritional analysis on food packaging doesn't always tell the whole story. You must also analyze the ingredient list, as the quality and availability of the proteins and fats can vary widely. However, even ingredient lists can be misleading. The ingredients listed first are the highest proportion of the food item, but you have no idea exactly what proportion. Be aware of ingredient splitting, which can push similar but less desirable items down the list, but if added together, might make up a high proportion of the diet (e.g. soy flour and soy meal).</p><h2>Protein Sources </h2><p>Look for meat and meat meals as opposed to by-products. Meat and poultry by-products are the bits that don't make it into human foods. They may be low in digestibility and therefore not really a useful protein source. Eggs are also a high-quality protein source. Look for meat or meat meals or eggs to make up the first three ingredients (you'll find very few foods that meet this requirement, but definitely avoid any that do not have high-quality proteins or fats as at least most of the first six ingredients). Beware the use of corn gluten, soy meal, rice gluten, and other vegetable or grain-based proteins that may boost the protein content, but are not useful to ferrets. Also watch for added sugars (sucrose, fructose, corn syrup, etc.).</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Ferrets may not like the taste of foods high in fish (and they may make the litter box pretty smelly, too), though some cold-water fish such as salmon is an excellent source of fat.</p><h2>Fats </h2><p>Look for high-quality sources balanced in omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids (poultry fat is usually considered a good source). This can be hard to determine from an ingredient list or nutritional analysis, however, and the fatty acid quality and balance are affected by processing as well.</p><h2>Ferret Foods </h2><p>There are several ferret diets available now, and some are better than others. Good diets tend to be expensive, but are worth it. There is no perfect diet very few foods come close to meeting the requirements set out above. It is really a matter of picking foods that you can readily get that are as close to ideal as possible. The lack of truly ideal ferret foods is one reason there is a growing interest in more natural diets for ferrets.</p><p>Any diet changes should be made gradually, mixing in the new food with the old and gradually reducing the amount of the old diet. It is often a good idea to use a mixture of foods starting when ferrets are young, as some can be stubborn about trying new foods, which may create problems if their current food becomes unavailable. Try to make sure you have two quality foods your ferret will eat.</p><h2>A Word on Cat Food </h2><h3>Warning</h3><p>Avoid feeding generic or ""grocery store"" brands of cat foods to ferrets, as these are typically very poor for ferrets.</p><h2>Treats </h2><p>Treats should be given in moderation. There are vitamin supplements for ferrets and hairball remedies which ferrets generally love, and they provide some benefits. These make good training aids and treats but should be used sparingly. Other treats include eggs (hard-boiled, scrambled), bits of cooked meats, or freeze-dried liver treats. Commercial ferret treats should only be used if they are meat-based avoid those with grains, vegetables, or sugars.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Ferrets have a sweet tooth but do not give in: Avoid sweet treats (including raisins and other fruits).</p>",830

Most of the time, your pet hamster will be a cuddly, affectionate companion, but in some situations, hamsters can and do bite. It's rare for a hamster to actually be aggressive, though, and they typically only bite when they get scared.</p><p>Those tiny teeth may not do as much damage as those of other animals, but a bite will hurt and should be discouraged. Fortunately, you can gradually train your hamster to accept being handled and stop biting.</p><h2>Why Do Hamsters Bite? </h2><p>Tame hamsters are those that have been handled regularly, so they're used to people and don't get scared easily. On the other hand, hamsters that have not been handled much are usually not very tame, and they often bite if you try to pick them up. When you're dealing with these hamsters, the most important thing to remember is that they're biting because they're afraid, not because they're aggressive.</p><h2>How to Stop the Biting </h2><p>The key to handling a hamster that bites is patience. You need to earn the trust of your hamster,and this is a slow and gradual process. This a good approach if you've had a hamster for some time and biting continues to be an issue. It's also a great way to introduce yourself to a new hamster that may be a little shy at first.</p><p>Don't be discouraged if it takes a month or even longer to gain your hamster's trust. And if your hamster settles down and responds faster than expected, you can shorten the time between the steps. If your hamster is still fearful at any point, go back to the previous step and spend a little more time working on it.</p><p>Over time, your hamster will learn to see you as a source of treats and not be scared of you. It will take a while, but it will be worth it in the end.</p><h2>Week 1:Let Your Hamster Get Used to You </h2><p>In the evening when it's most active, spend some time sitting near the cage and talking to your hamster. You can read or even sing to it if you don't know what to say. The idea is to let your hamster adjust to your presence, especially your scent and your voice.</p><p>Remember, moving to a new cage in new surroundings is very stressful, so this period also gives your hamster a chance to adjust to life in its new home. At this point, don'ttry to touch your hamster.</p><p>During these early days with your hamster, you may need to pick it up to do cage cleaning or return it to the cage after an escape. To pick up your hamster before it has fully learned to accept you, herd it into a corner with a towel or the open mouth of a drinking glass, then scoop it up gently in the towel or glass.</p><h2>Week 2:Let Your Hamster Get Used to Your Hand </h2><p>While continuing to sit by the cage and talk to your hamster,place your hand inside the cage. Move very slowly. The first day, put your hand just inside the door or on top of the cage. Each day after that, try putting your hand in a little farther.</p><p>Don't try to touch your hamster, but if it becomes curious, let it sniff or explore your hand.</p><h2>Week 3: Offer Your Hamster Treats </h2><p>By now, you may have discovered some of your hamster's favorite treats. If not, try sunflower seeds, raisins, and apples. While you should only feed your pet these treats in moderation, they can be great training tools.</p><p>Offer your hamster these goodies from the bare hand that you've been putting in its cage. Eventually, it will probably come over to eat, which will help you gain its trust.</p><h2>Week 4: Pet Your Hamster </h2><p>Once your hamster is taking treats comfortably, you can begin trying to gently pet it. If it tolerates this, you can move on to the next step of picking up your hamster. Otherwise, continue to patiently offer treats and petting.</p><h2>Week 5: Pick Up Your Hamster </h2><p>If your hamster accepts treats and allows you to touch it, it's time to try picking up your pet. Once again, go slowly and let your hamster guide how far you get in each session.</p><p>A good approach is to entice your hamster onto your hands with the treats. Then, you can try scooping it up with both hands.</p><p>Place one hand on either side of your hamster and then bring your hands together under its belly. Gently cup your hamster in your hands, rather than tightly gripping over its back. Hamsters sometimes find pressure over their backs to be threatening at first.</p><p>Don't hold your hamster high off the ground in case it tries to jump out of your hands. At first, try holding it just off the floor of its cage, gradually lifting a little higher. Holding a hamster facing your body may make it less likely to try to jump away.</p>",832
57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-do-guinea-pigs-bite-5219809,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>Why Guinea Pigs Bite and How to Stop It</h1>,"<h1>Why Guinea Pigs Bite and How to Stop It</h1><p>Guinea pigs are very popular small pets and are great for both kids and adults. Guinea pigs are personable, don't take up a huge amount of space, and are usually very gentle. On occasion, however, guinea pigs may nibble or bite. This can be problematic, especially for kids that don't understand why their beloved pet would bite them. Knowing why a guinea pig may bite and how to avoid or stop it is very beneficial. This knowledge is helpful not only to prevent unwanted injuries but also to help improve the relationship you or your child has with your pet. </p><h2>Why Do Guinea Pigs Bite? </h2><p>Guinea pigs are extremely social creatures. They make many different noises or vocalizations to communicate with each other and feel a range of emotions. A guinea pig may occasionally bite as a response to their emotions or environments. Here are some reasons your guinea pig might bite.</p><h2>Feeling Scared </h2><p>If your guinea pig feels scared, is startled, or is being bullied by other guinea pigs, it may react by biting you or another guinea pig. This reaction is natural and is an attempt to protect itself or stop whatever is scaring it from happening. It may occur if your guinea pig is being held too high in the air, another guinea pig keeps stealing its food, or you attempt to pick it up while it's sleeping.</p><h2>Feeling Hungry </h2><p>Guinea pigs love to eat and even have some favorite foods. If they are especially hungry or are fighting over a favorite food item, they may nip at you or another guinea pig. This behavior isn't unexpected from any hungry animal, but there are ways to help decrease the likelihood of it occurring. </p><h2>Accidental </h2><p>If your guinea pig smells food on you or you are holding a chew toy, it may bite your fingers accidentally. Your guinea pig may have gotten confused and thought your fingers were actually its chew stick or snack. It probably didn't mean to bite you and realized your fingers wasn't food as soon as it made contact with them. </p><h2>Feeling Stressed </h2><p>A guinea pig may feel stressed for a variety of reasons. In addition to being scared and being bullied by other guinea pigs, cages that are too small, not having a place to sleep, chronic competition for a mate or food, and an uncomfortable cage floor can result in your guinea pig being stressed. This can then cause it to be more reactive and likely to bite you.</p><h2>Wearing Down Its Teeth </h2><p>Your guinea pig may be biting you or its cage because it is trying to wear its teeth down. Guinea pigs have teeth that continuously grow throughout their lifetimes, so they need to chew on things to keep them short. This is a very natural and necessary behavior, and if your guinea pig doesn't have adequate items such as a daily supply of hay that it is supposed to chew, it will find something else to chew on.</p><h2>Feeling Sick </h2><p>Guinea pigs that aren't feeling well may be more likely to bite. They may not want to be bothered and if you are trying to handle them or force them to eat, biting may be their way of trying to tell you that they want to be left alone. If your guinea pig has never bitten before and suddenly nipped at you, this is a good indication that it may be sick.</p><h2>Feeling Pain </h2><p>If your guinea pig is sick, it may also be in pain. Other causes of pain can also result in your guinea pig biting. If you or your child are squeezing your guinea pig too tightly, its leg is stuck in the cage, it has been injured, or is experiencing pain from something else, biting is more likely. Make sure that your guinea pig doesn't appear to be in pain if it's trying to bite.</p><h2>Hormones </h2><p>Puberty occurs in males around two to three months of age, and if two males are housed together, they may bite each other or be more likely to bite you because of their high testosterone levels. It's best to keep intact male guinea pigs separate to avoid wounds from fighting. Females guinea pigs have also shown to be less social when they are in heat and may be less tolerant of other guinea pigs and handling.</p><h2>How to Stop Guinea Pigs From Biting </h2><p>There are some simple things you can do to discourage your guinea pig from biting. Ensure your guinea pig's enclosure is not too small. Provide plenty of hiding spots and ample food sources. Don't wake your guinea pig up if it is sleeping, and provide it with plenty of chew toys.</p><p>If you suspect your guinea pig is sick or in pain, don't handle it more than necessary and bring them into the vet. If another guinea pig is bullying it, you may need to permanently separate them.</p>",817
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ideas-for-making-a-homemade-rabbit-cage-5224645,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Ideas for Making a Homemade Rabbit Cage</h1>,"<h1>Ideas for Making a Homemade Rabbit Cage</h1><p>Rabbit cages can be expensive, and most rabbits need a lot more space than the average store-bought cage provides, especially if it is not a dwarf or mini breed. Many rabbit owners transform small bedrooms or large closets into rabbit-proofed rooms for their bunnies to run around in but this isn't possible for everyone. Making a cage for your rabbit is a great way to save some money and ensure it is perfect for your specific rabbit and your space.</p><h2>Cage Sizes for Rabbits </h2><p>Rabbits need a secure yet large enclosure to sleep, eat, and spend their time in when they can't be supervised. These enclosures are not a replacement for an exercise space but are instead meant to be used at night and when you aren't at home with your rabbit. According to the American Rabbit Breeders Association and Michigan State University, the following table should be used to help determine the minimum floor space of your homemade rabbit cage.</p><h2>Materials for Rabbit Cages </h2><p>All the materials that you use to build a rabbit cage need to be safe for use around a rabbit. Rabbits may chew on materials, especially if you don't provide them with enough chew toys, so you don't want to use treated or painted wood on surfaces that your rabbit could potentially nibble on. This can include lumber, plywood, wood composite panels, plexiglass or acrylic sheets, screen, and chicken wire. Many other materials from your local home improvement store are good options if you plan to build an outdoor hutch otherwise plastic storage bins, exercise pen panels, and other creative items may also be used.</p><h2>Safety Concerns </h2><p>Aside from ensuring the materials you use to build the cage are not going to be toxic to your rabbit if it chews it, you'll want to make sure any openings in the cage are not big enough for your rabbit to escape or get stuck in. Cage floors can have a flat bottom or a wire bottom for feces to drop through, but if you opt for a wire bottom, make sure the holes aren't too small. If so, a rabbit's foot or leg could get stuck; attempt to provide padding in areas of the enclosure to avoid hock sores developing. Lids and doors should be secure, and there shouldn't be any protruding screws, nails, wire pieces, or sharp edges that could poke or cut your rabbit.</p><h2>Types of Homemade Cages </h2><p>There are a few main types of homemade rabbit cages: hutches, x-pens, revised dog crates, and containers. One type may work better in your home and for your specific rabbit than another.</p><h3>Hutches </h3><p>While usually used for outdoor rabbits, hutches are wooden cages that have at least two sections for your rabbit to use as a retreat. The largest part of the hutch is usually a wooden frame covered in chicken wire and is open to the elements while the second, smaller part of the hutch is an enclosed sleeping area meant to protect your rabbit from the wind, rain, hot sun, and other unwanted weather. These are not often used indoors since most of the designs involve allowing the feces to drop through the bottom onto the ground but some designs are made for indoor use. Indoor hutches are built from scratch but can be completely custom.</p><h3>X-Pens </h3><p>If you don't have other pets that could pose a danger to your rabbit, a homemade cage made of exercise panels commonly referred to as an x-pen can be used. Small square panels designed to connect together can be purchased and a shallow kiddie pool, puppy pee pads, a tarp, or another surface to help keep your floor clean can be used as the base of the ""cage."" This option does not have a lid, though, so it is not ideal for households with small children, dogs, or cats who could cause harm to your rabbit.</p><h3>Dog Crates </h3><p>If you like the idea of an x-pen but want a lid on your cage, a large dog crate can be used to house your bunny. These crates come with a removable tray for easy cleaning and to keep your floors clean and some even have more than one door. This option is not good for small rabbits because of the cage bar spacing on some larger dog crates.</p><h3>Containers </h3><p>Large storage containers are another easy option for a homemade rabbit cage. The downside to this option is that there is no door, and if you want to put a lid on the container, you'll have to cut out a lot of holes to provide adequate ventilation. Some people opt to cut an entry door out of the side of the container. This way, their rabbit can go in and out of it as they please and then place this container inside an exercise pen. </p>",802
59,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fun-facts-about-goats-4134889,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,"<h1>What You Dont Know About Goats, But Should</h1>","<h1>What You Don't Know About Goats, But Should</h1><p>Goats are finally having a moment on the internet and it's not just because they're super cute. They're pretty weird, too. How? Theyfrolic in little kids' footie pajamas; they terrify unsuspecting people byscreaming like humans(otherwise known as bleating); and they love to climb on top of random objects, like cows.</p><p>Want to learn more about these adorable, barnyard weirdos? Read on to learn the 10 things you don't know about goats, but definitely should.</p><h3>The Perfect Name for a Pet Goat</h3><h2>Goats Have Unique Accents </h2><p>It was previously believed that only a few mammals humans, elephants, and dolphins had accents. But researchers have discovered that goats, too, have unique accents. What's more, their accents change as they age or come into contact with other crews of goats, just like when you visit your cousins from the Midwest.</p><h2>Goats Love to Stand on Stuff </h2><p>Goats have a propensity to climb on basically anything, from cows to sheds, to tree branches. Why? Domesticated goats originated from wild goats that lived in the rocky terrains of southwest Asia and Eastern Europe. Those mountain goats had to keep their balance crossing high-up cliffs and ledges a skill that was passed down to their modern-day ancestors.</p><p>So, if you happen to see a goat standing on a horse, he's just doing what feels right... from an evolutionary standpoint.</p><h2>Goats ""Faint"" When They're Scared </h2><p>It doesn't seem like the life of a goat would be all that frightening they mostly just relax, forage, climb on top of stuff and nap but footage of goats being scared and ""fainting"" has been making rounds on the interwebs for years.</p><p>It turns out, this phenomenon only affects one particular type of goat, called myotonic goats or Tennessee stiff-legs, and they aren't fainting at all. Rather, when the goats are startled, their muscles tense up and don't relax immediately due to a condition called Thomsn's disease.</p><p>As they get older, most goats get used to the condition. So when they're scared, they just scurry away with super stiff legs.</p><p>The next time your great aunt sends you a video of goats fainting on Facebook, you can school her in barnyard genetics.</p><h2>They Have Amazing Vision </h2><p>Goats' eyes can look pretty creepy, but their horizontal pupils help protect them from predators. Unlike vertical pupils in predators like cats or snakes, goats' horizontal pupils give them panoramic vision. That means they can see all around themselves not just what's in front of them.</p><p>For an animal whose only defense mechanisms are 1.running away, 2. climbing something tall or 3. pretending to faint, having 340 degrees of vision is pretty important.</p><h2>Goats Are Picky Eaters </h2><p>Movies and cartoons often show goats noshing on garbage, like tin cans, but they're actually worse thanchicken-finger-obsessed toddlerswhen it comes to mealtime. They use their hypersensitive mouths to forage for fresh hay or plants, and are rather meticulous on what type of weeds, grasses and hay they will settle on. They certainly won't just eat anything.</p><h2>Goats Burp A Lot </h2><p>Like cows, goats have multiple stomachs that handle the different stages of digestion. The first ""stomach"" is called a rumen, which can hold a whoppingof plant material in a mature goat. As food is broken down in the rumen, it produces a lot of gas it is five gallons of food, after all! which causes our charming four-legged friends to burp and fart all the livelong day.</p><h2>Goats Can Walk Immediately After Birth </h2><p>Most human babies take between nine and 18 months toand start walking. Baby goats, otherwise known as kids? They start walking mere moments after birth.</p><p>What's the hold up, human babies?</p><h2>Goat's Milk is Healthier Than Cow's Milk </h2><p>Swapping cow's milk for goat's milk can have some serious health benefits and make you feel a lil' extra fancy.</p><p>Goat's milk contains properties that reduce inflammation in the body which is believed to be the cause of many maladies especially atherogenesis and heart disease and promotes good gut health.</p><p>Not to mention,cheese made from goat's milkis pretty darn tasty in sandwiches, salads or even desserts.</p><h2>Goats Were Kids First </h2><p>The first instance of (human) children being referred to as ""kids"" was in the late 1500s, but came into wider use during the mid-1800s. Young goats, however, win this highly coveted title: They were called kids way back in the 1200s.</p><h2>Goats Scream Like Humans </h2><p>Have you ever heard a goat bleat? Then did you feel like the bravest person alive?</p><p>Like human voices, bleating varies from goat to goat. Some goats may sound like a grown man screaming, while others may sound like human children screaming. Regardless of their pitch, volume and depth, bleating can be pretty dang scary especially when you're not expecting it.</p>",803
60,https://www.thesprucepets.com/toys-for-gerbils-1238859,Small Pets > Gerbils,<h1>Toys for Gerbils</h1>,"<h1>Toys for Gerbils</h1><h2>Gerbils are active and playful and should be given a variety of toys</h2><p>First and foremost, toys for your gerbils must be safe. Gerbils have a habit of sticking their heads into things to explore, so make sure any toys (especially those with holes cut in them) don't have spaces in which your gerbils could get their heads stuck. Make sure your gerbils aren't able to splinter off sharp pieces of plastic or other materials and swallow them.</p><p>Remove any plastic toys once the gerbils start chewing on them. Also make sure they are just shredding cardboard, rather than eating it. Make sure they are no parts or strings on toys that could trap a gerbil's toes, legs, or tail.</p><h2>Wheels </h2><p>Many gerbils enjoy running on wheels. Any wheels should have a solid surface and have a solid back wall. Their tails and other body parts can get caught in and injured on wheels with rungs or cross-supports. A solid wheel such as a Silent Spinner or Wodent Wheel is a good choice.</p><p>Get a medium-sized wheel, large enough that the gerbils back can be held relatively straight while running. Not all gerbils like wheels though, so don't be concerned about gerbils who don't use them.</p><h2>Hides </h2><p>Wooden hides and houses (untreated wood) make good choices, though small cardboard boxes will be a hit, too. They will quickly shred cardboard though, so these will have to be replaced often (choose cardboard with as little ink as possible). Wood will be chewed as well, so while they will last a lot longer than cardboard, you can plan on replacing wooden houses after a while, too.</p><p>You can sometimes find hollowed-out logs at pet stores, including small logs in the small pet section or perhaps slightly larger half logs in the reptile section. A half coconut shell and ceramic or clay plant pots placed on their sides can be used this way, too.</p><h2>Chew Toys </h2><p>Gerbils love to chew. A cardboard tube from a toilet paper roll or paper towel roll is one of a gerbil's favorite things. Some people have expressed concern about the types of glue used in these and now colorful safe (and a bit more sturdy and long-lasting) cardboard tubes are made for pets to play with.</p><p>Look for Totally Chewbular Tubes, Chubes, and Critter Caves, along with others.Twin Squeaks also has a wonderful suggestion just take old file folders, lay them flat, and cut them into smaller sections, then roll up tightly and hold for a bit. When you let them go, they loosen but stay more or less rolled, and your gerbils can have a ball with them. Even a small brown paper lunch bag will provide hiding, play, and shredding possibilities!</p><p>Any untreated wood (vegetable dyed is okay) items make great chew toys too. You can buy them or make your own out of untreated wood scraps. Branches can be offered for chewing, too try apple or willow (avoid any evergreen tree branches). You can also check your pet store for things such as cholla, driftwood, and other wood such as grapevine (possibly found in the reptile section), which make good climbing toys.</p><p>There are also lots of wicker, natural grass, and plant fiber tunnels; balls; and huts out there (especially marketed for rabbits), and these are also great for gnawing.</p><h2>Climbing Toys and Tubes </h2><p>Gerbils will climb on just about anything, such as wooden houses. You can also buy wooden ladders (check the bird section if they aren't in the small pet section), see-saws, and other wooden accessories. Plastic climbing tubes (such as those for hamsters) and accessories can be used, too, though you need to be extra careful that your gerbils are not splintering off bits of plastic and swallowing them.</p><p>Plastic toys and tubes are best offered only when you are there to keep an eye on things. You can also try PVC pipe sections from the plumbing section of the hardware store, as PVC tends to be a little more resistant to chewing than plastic tubes made for rodents. Relatively new on the market are dyed bamboo tubes, and these are said to be tougher and longer-lasting. You can also find ceramic tubes (check the aquarium section), and these have the advantage of being virtually indestructible.</p><h2>Dust Baths </h2><p>Give you gerbils a heavy ceramic or glass dish with a couple of inches of chinchilla dust in it. Your gerbils will most likely love rolling and digging around in the dust, and in the process get their fur cleaned and conditioned.</p><h2>Digging </h2><p>Gerbils love to dig. Try to make at least a part of their cage very deep with substrate. You can also place wood shelters (such as under the shavings so the gerbils can have little ""underground"" burrows to sleep in). Adding Timothy hay to the bedding will help the bedding hold tunnels better. You can also put ceramic tubes (check the fish section) under the substrate for burrows.</p>",813
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchilla-bedding-options-1238123,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Comfortable Bedding Options for Pet Chinchillas</h1>,"<h1>Comfortable Bedding Options for Pet Chinchillas</h1><p>Chinchillas have soft coats and sensitive feet that need something soft to bounce around in. Your bedding options may seem endless while walking down the aisles at the pet store but some substrates are much better options than others.</p><h2>CareFresh Ultra </h2><p>This bedding is great for several reasons. Not only is it soft and absorbent but it is made from recycled paper and isn't dusty. For those of us who enjoy a little color in our lives, you'll be excited to learn that it comes in a variety of fun colors.</p><h2>Cell-Sorb Plus, Sun Seed Fresh World, and Yesterday's News </h2><p>These kinds of bedding are other types of recycled paper beddings available to pet owners. They are compacted materials that come in pelleted forms. They are very absorbent and not dusty but aren't as soft and fluffy as the CareFresh. Some owners like them better because they aren't as lightweight as the CareFresh so they don't get kicked out of the cage easily. Many pet stores use these products because of their odor control and large packaging options but you may not be too concerned with the cost if you are only changing one chinchilla cage once a week.</p><h2>Kaytee Total Comfort </h2><p>Similar to CareFresh but with a smaller price tag, Kaytee's Total Comfort bedding is a recycled paper bedding that is better than your wood shavings but not quite as good as some of the other alternative paper beddings. Owners find it dusty, less absorbent, and not as attractive as other products.</p><h2>Kaytee Soft Sorbent </h2><p>Just like the Total Comfort, the Soft Sorbent is a recycled paper bedding from Kaytee. This bedding is better at absorbing urine and water than the Total Comfort but costs more. It is also very variable in size depending on the batch you purchase (sometimes it appears to be much too large for a gerbil cage).</p><h2>Kaytee Clean and Cozy </h2><p>Yet another Kaytee pet bedding, their Clean and Cozy product is similar to CareFresh but slightly cheaper, less absorbent, lighter, and softer. Depending on what you want from the bedding you may or may not prefer it to CareFresh.</p><h2>Lifemate Hemp Bedding </h2><p>Not easily found other than online, hemp beddings are popular among eco-friendly fans. While it isn't as soft as the CareFresh, it is very absorbent, seems to be cost-effective, and good at controlling odors.</p><h2>Fabric </h2><p>Many chinchilla owners purchase fabrics like fleece, pillowcases, or towels to use in their enclosures since chinchillas love to hide. Also, not only will fabrics absorb liquids but they can be washed and reused and will add whatever colors you choose to the enclosure. Many custom chinchilla fleece accessories exist online and are handmade by crafters to give your chinchilla a custom, comfy look.</p><h2>Corn Cob Bedding </h2><p>This bedding will absorb liquids and is inexpensive but it doesn't do much for odor, isn't as soft as some other options, and has to be monitored for mold growth. It isn't recommended for chinchilla houses.</p><h2>Paper Shavings Pet Bedding </h2><p>This is a very soft, absorbent, and cost-effective bedding. It is packed into blocks and expands into an enormous amount of bedding that you can spread generously into your chinchilla's house. It is lightweight so it can be kicked around easily and is made from recycled paper directories.</p><p>Endless bedding options will continue to be manufactured but you'll find the best option for you and your chinnie by trying out a few of them. Decide what is most important to you (cost, absorbency, odor, etc.) and then try out a few similar products. But don't forget to see what your pet prefers. He'll be the one spending more time on it than you!</p><h2>Aspen Shavings</h2><p>Aspen is a finer wood shaving than pine and cedar and many owners still enjoy the absorbency and aroma it offers in addition to how inexpensive it is. The downsides to aspen are most notably the dustiness and the fact that it seems to stick to everything, such as your chinchilla's blankets. If you need cheap bedding in a pinch, choose aspen over the other wood shavings.</p><h2>Pine Shavings </h2><p>This wood shaving is a classic small pet bedding but is no longer the ideal bedding for chinchillas. The wood shavings aren't very absorbent.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>There is some discussion that the pine oils can cause health problems in your chinchilla and even cut up their feet. It is best to just avoid this wood product altogether.</p><h2>Cedar Shavings </h2><p>Just say no to cedar shavings. Cedar used to be popular due to the natural aroma it gave off but there are now much safer options available to pet owners. Stay away from cedar bedding!</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Cedar shaving are cheap and found everywhere, but they are also toxic to your chinchilla because they cause respiratory and allergic problems as well as liver changes.</p>",792
62,https://www.thesprucepets.com/natural-ferret-diet-1238662,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Towards a More Natural Ferret Diet - Whole Prey and Raw Foods</h1>,"<h1>Towards a More Natural Ferret Diet - Whole Prey and Raw Foods</h1><p>Commercial ferret diets and feeding recommendations have come a long way in the past few years, but we still need to ask what is the best diet for pet ferrets. The situation has only been exacerbated by massive concerns over the safety of ingredients used in pet food manufacturing as a result of recalls in 2007.</p><p>Ferrets are ""obligate"" carnivores, which means they are meant to eat meat just meat. Ferrets are not designed to digest grains, or sugars, or fillers such as corn. These are unfortunately used in the processing of many ferret diets, especially some of the earlier ones. Years ago, high-quality kitten foods were often better suited to meet the needs of ferrets for protein and fat requirements than the scarcely available ferret foods. The science of feeding ferrets has come a long way and processed ferret foods are much better (and more available) than they once were, but are processed foods good enough? More and more ferret owners are wondering if more natural diets such as whole prey or raw foods are a better way to meet the dietary needs of their pets. The best thing to do is to ask your vet their opinion on what food to feed your ferret.</p><h2>Current Status </h2><p>Opinions are definitely mixed and often quite heated on the topic of pet diets, ferret foods included. What we hope to do here is look at current recommendations for feeding ferrets and the pros and cons of more natural diets such as whole prey and raw diets.</p><p>We won't make recommendations of one method of feeding over another, as we believe in the end it is up to each owner to make a decision based on information that is available. We also know that in the end, the choice will often come down to the comfort levels of the owners, convenience, and comfort with food handling and safety issues. It is not our intent to get into a debate over the way to feed or condemn anyone's choices.</p><p>Before we start, we want to make some disclaimers and disclosures: the author is not a nutritionist, nor a ferret owner, and does feed their other pets processed foods.</p><h2>Basic Requirements for a Ferret Diet </h2><h2>About Processed Dry Foods </h2><p>The science behind dry ferret foods has come a long way along with understanding the needs of ferrets, but not all ferret foods are created equally. Ferret owners need to do lots of label reading to choose good food. Unfortunately, the nutritional analysis doesn't tell the whole story. You must also analyze the ingredient list as the quality and availability of the proteins and fats can vary widely (though even ingredient lists can be misleading). However, there are some good quality dry ferret foods that would are considered by many experts to be well-balanced diets.</p><h2>What Is Meant by ""Natural Diets""? </h2><p>There are many different alternatives to commercial diets, including cooked homemade formulations. But for the purposes of this article, we will be referring to whole prey diets and raw diets, which are touted as more naturally replicating the diets of the domestic ferret's wild ancestors. Such diets seem to be gaining in popularity not only with ferret owners but also with cat and dog owners</p><p>As you can see, the array of choices makes it all more confusing. But as a group, what are the pros and cons of natural diets compared to processed dry foods?</p><h2>Pros </h2><p>As supporters of a whole prey diet point out, the incidence of insulinoma is higher in countries where processed dry diets are popular, and less common where whole prey diets are popular. No cause-and-effect relationship has ever been shown, but the incidence of insulinoma in North American ferrets is disturbing.Insulinomasare tumors of the pancreas involving cells that produce insulin for sugar metabolism.</p><h2>Cons </h2><h3>Warning</h3><p>Beware of the possibilityof choking, obstructions, and injuries from bones including those from whole prey. The risks are minimal (and not as high as many people believe) but there.</p><p>Advocates say that whole prey or raw diets are better for ferrets because they replicate the diet of their wild ancestors. Inmagazine, Dr. Karen Rosenthal points out that we don't really know that the digestive system of ferrets is equal to that of their wild ancestors, nor do we have proof that wild animals do not have problems as a result of eating their natural diets.</p><h2>Where It Stands </h2><p>As a ferret owner, you need to really do your research and be comfortable with whatever you choose to feed.

63,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-do-snails-sleep-5114910,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>How Much Do Snails Sleep?</h1>,"<h1>How Much Do Snails Sleep?</h1><p>Some pets are as slow as sloths so it can be difficult to tell if they are alive. Snails are one such animal that some pet owners have a hard time determining whether or not they are sleeping. It's important to know if your snail is sleeping, or doing something else that is more concerning, to ensure its enclosure is appropriate, though.</p><h2>Do Snails Sleep? </h2><p>Snails do sleep, but not very much. It was not known how a snail sleeps until 2011 when Canadian researchers studied pond snails and discovered they do in fact enter a sleep-like state. The eight pond snails in the study slept intermittently in a pattern that repeated every two to three days, unlike the 24-hour cycle that most animals use. Roughly seven bouts of sleeping for 21-23 minutes at a time occurred over a 13 hour period. This sleeping pattern was then followed by 33-41 hours of activity before repeating. The time of day did not seem to play a role in when the sleeping bouts occurred. Different species of snails may have different sleeping patterns but they have not been studied. This is compared to humans that sleep for seven to eight hours every 24-hour period and usually at night.</p><h2>How to Tell if Your Snail is Sleeping </h2><p>The pond snail study showed the snails had a relaxed foot, mantle, and tentacles and the radula (tongue) did not grab at anything when they were in a sleep-like state. The shell may flop over due to the relaxed mantle but the sleeping snails did not curl up into their shells. There was also a reduced response to being touched and to food. Since snails sleep for short only about 20 minutes at a time, if after looking at it and you still can't tell if it is sleeping, simply wait half an hour and see if it is more alert.</p><h2>How Long Do Snails Live? </h2><p>While your snail may simply be sleeping, it's also important to remember how long a snail typically lives. If you have a wild-caught garden snail that you found in your yard, the life expectancy is usually less than five years, but it is also not unheard of for them to live into double digits in captivity. Larger land snails like giant African land snails are also expected to live to be at least 10 or more years old. Depending on the species of snail and how old it was when you got it (which you may not always know if you found it in the garden), your snail may only be in your care for a short period of time, or you could be enjoying your little gastropod for the next decade or more.</p><h2>How to Wake a Sleeping Snail </h2><p>If for some reason you must wake your sleeping snail, petting it is the best way to rouse it. Putting food in front of its face may also wake it, but this response may not work as well as touching your snail. You should never grab a snail by the shell, regardless of whether they are sleeping or awake, though, as this can damage the mantle and even cause death. A gentle stroke or scratch will suffice. Since snails only sleep for about 20 minutes at a time, it is simply best to wait for them to wake up on their own.</p><h2>Do Snails Hibernate or Estivate? </h2><p>If your snail has been sleeping for more than 24 hours, it is estivating or hibernating. Some species of snail will go into hibernation if they get too cold and dry. This typically occurs in the winter in wild snails. Their heart rate will lower and they may appear to have died, but they are actually just conserving their energy. Some land snails can reportedly hibernate for up to three years, though this is not the same as sleeping. This lengthy hibernation is also an indication that your snail's environment is much too cold and dry. Warming the enclosure and adding some moisture should rouse your hibernating snail.</p><p>On the other hand, if your enclosure is too hot and dry, your snail may enter into estivation. In wild, this occurs during the summer, but if your enclosure lacks moisture and is too warm, this lengthy sleep can begin. A mucus coating may be visible as evidence of your snail's attempt to protect itself from the dry heat; this is an indication that you need to cool down its enclosure. Some species of snails will also burrow into their substrate during estivation. If your snail's enclosure is between the ideal 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, you should not expect to see your snail hibernating or estivating.</p>",802

She has written many books, including one on keeping rabbits, and owns Laughing Crow & Company, a farm that's home to all kinds of animals, including horses and goats.</p><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Once in a while, a rabbit will give birth somewhere other than a nest box. The husbandry terminology for this is ""a doe kindling on a wire."" When it doesn't have the tight confines of a nest box, a baby bunny, or kit, can get separated from its littermates or the mother doe. This is dangerous for newborn bunnies since they are born blind, deaf, and hairless with thinner-than-paper skin. They become chilled quickly, and exposure can kill them in minutes.</p><p>There are several ways that you can try to safely warm up a baby bunny to the point it can be returned to the warmth of the nest box, its siblings, and mother. Unlike cats or dogs, rabbits do not retrieve or transport their young. Without human intervention, there is no way the furless baby bunny can get back into the nest box. It will surely die if left alone.</p><h2>Before You Begin </h2><p>Before you take any of the actions described, start by assessing the baby rabbit (kit). If the kit is warm and moving about, it may have just recently wandered and simply needs to be placed back into the nest box with its siblings where it will warm up quickly.</p><p>If the kit is cool or cold to the touch, do not immediately assume that it is dead. To preserve energy when their temperature drops, kits become very still, which keeps them alive as long as possible.</p><h2>What You Need </h2> <h2>Use Body Warmth </h2><p>The first thing you can do, which requires no preparation, is to place the kit under your shirt up against your warm skin. The baby should begin to warm up immediately. You may even feel its feet starting to move.</p><h2>Try a Heating Pad </h2><h2>Give It a Waterless Warm Water Bath </h2><p>Another technique is to put warm water into a bowl on the counter. Place the kit into a storage baggie (be sure to leave the top open and hold it securely) and place the storage baggie in the water bath so that the baby is laying against the warm water inside the baggie. The idea is not to let the water touch the kit, but to let the warm water heat its skin through the plastic bag.</p><h2>Use Warm Towels </h2><p>You could also put hand towels into the dryer and once they warm up (but don't get hot) simply hold the kit in your hands with the towel wrapped around it. Once the hand towel cools, wrap the baby bunny in another warm towel from the dryer. Do this until the bunny pinks up and is quite warm without the towels.</p><h2>Return the Kit to the Nest Box </h2><p>Before returning the kit to the box with the rest of the litter, it really needs to be fully (and slowly) warmed up without any chill to its little body. If it's still cool, the other kits will wriggle away from it. Without their body warmth, the newly warmed bunny could become chilled again and die.</p><h2>When a Kit Fails to Recover </h2><p>Sometimes a baby can be brought back from the brink of death, only to gape, gasp, and die, even though it seemed you were able to warm it up. You have to realize that you did what you could, but some kits are just too far gone to be brought back. This is the unfortunate and not-so-fun part of rabbit raising.</p><h2>How to Prevent a Baby Bunny From Becoming Cold </h2><p>This fear of a doe kindling on a wire is one very important reason to check frequently on rabbits that are pregnant and due to give birth. In another sad scenario, a newborn may be safe in the nest box, nursing, but then the doe hops out of the box with the baby unwittingly still attached to the teat. The baby falls off, gets separated from the nest, and cold exposure begins.</p>",752
65,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hedgehog-mites-1239049,Small Pets > Hedgehogs,<h1>Mites in Hedgehogs</h1>,"<h1>Mites in Hedgehogs</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Mites are annoying and common parasites that bite and cause irritation to your hedgehog's skin, spines (quills), and hair. They can spread from one hedgehog to another quite easily. Fortunately, they're easy to prevent and treat. Unlike some other external parasites such as ticks and fleas, mites will not typically bother human beings.</p><h2>What Are Mites? </h2><p>Mites are a type of small red or black arachnid, like spiders and ticks. You may or may not be able to see the actual mites on your pet hedgehog but you probably will see the damage the mitescause to your pet.</p><h2>Symptoms of Mites in Hedgehogs </h2><p>You may not notice any signs of mites in your hedgehog when the problem is in the early stages and especially since your pet is covered in quills that can hide any trouble. However mites may be running around all over your hedgehog's face and ears, and may be visible. </p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Spine Loss </h3><p>The presence of mites can lead to hair and spine loss in your hedgehog. While hedgehogs will normally shed some of their spines, areas of apparent spine loss or hair loss are abnormal and should be indicators that your hedgehog may havemites.</p><h3>Excessive Gnawing and Scratching </h3><p>Mites cause an itchy irritation and will cause your hedgehog to constantly and aggressively gnaw, scratch, and even lick or chew itself to rid itself of the discomfort. This type of activity can lead to hair and spine loss. Your pet may even frequently rub up against its cage or object in the cage to scratch the itch.</p><h3>Weight Loss and Low Energy </h3><p>As with any animal that has any type of irritation or disease, your hedgehog may be uninterested in food and it will begin to lose weight and act lethargic.</p><h3>Dandruff and Red, Flaky Skin </h3><p>The frequency of biting and scratching at its skin to relieve the itch will cause your hedgehog to develop injured skin that can be tender and red. The skin will also become very flaky. </p><h2>Causes of Mites </h2><p>Hedgehogs can fall victim to mites in many ways. New hedgehogs brought into the home, bedding, and food are the usual culprits of a mite infestation. It's not unusual for hedgehogs to be infested with mites if, for example, it has lived in a pet store near rodents or birds. If you haven't exposed your hedgehog to another hedgehog, and haven't handled another hedgehog and then handled your own, the mite infestation may originate in its kibble or bedding. Natural items like food and substrate often carry small mites that are then are introduced to your hedgehog's enclosure and cause an infestation.</p><h2>Diagnosing Mites in Hedgehogs </h2><p>Your veterinarian will diagnose mites by conducting a skin scrape to obtain a sample ofskin and hair and look under a microscope for the mites. A skin scrape is not a perfectly accurate test, but if there is a heavy burden of mites it will usually be able to detect their presence.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Even if the skin scrape used for diagnosis is negative your vet may still treat for mites based on symptoms since mites are fairly common in hedgehogs. There are no anti-mite treatments specifically made for hedgehogs, but certain treatments made for cats are generally safe. Your vet will probably use a drug such as ivermectin.</p><p>Avoid using any medication without your vet's approval, as hedgehogs respond badly to some treatments intended for cats and dogs. In particular, avoid mite collars, permethrin sprays, or other permethrin products, as these can be lethal to your pet.</p><p>If these mite treatments do not work and the skin scrape was negative, further testing such as skin biopsies may be warranted to check for other diseases or allergies.</p><p>Aside from treating yourhedgehog for mites, you'll need to take these steps to treat its environment as well.</p><h2>Prognosis for Hedgehogs With Mites </h2><p>If given the correct medical treatment by a vet, your hedgehog should respond to the medicine very well. Environmental treatment for mites is usually successful if it's done long enough. However, recurrent bouts of mites can occur if the last adults from the breakout were not caught and they begin to lay eggs.</p><h2>How to Prevent Mites </h2><p>There are many ways to prevent mites, and it almost always has to do with cleaning and maintaining your pet's environment.</p>",709
66,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-chinchillas-get-wet-5184425,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Can Chinchillas Get Wet?</h1>,"<h1>Can Chinchillas Get Wet?</h1><p>Chinchillas are rodents that are originally from the Andes mountains in South America. They are tolerant to colder temperatures and enjoy lounging on pieces of cool granite, but they are also very sensitive to heat. Many animals would choose to cool off by taking a bath but chinchillas do their own thing. Instead of water baths, chinchillas take dust baths. These dust baths may seem counterproductive to those who do not understand the skin and fur care of these rodents but chinchillas know what they're doing. Water baths can actually do more harm than good to these incredibly soft pets, so it's vital to their health for owners to understand their unique needs.</p><h2>Why Do Chinchillas Take Dust Baths? </h2><p>Chinchillas take dust baths because they naturally secrete a lot of oils from their back. If a chinchilla isn't able to take a dust bath, its fur will become oily and matted. Chinchillas have extremely fine and dense fur so it's easy for moisture and oil to build up and cause a skin infection. The dust bath absorbs this excess oil and keeps the fur dry and soft, thus preventing excess moisture from building up and infections from occurring. Dust baths are recommended at least twice a week and either Fuller's earth or commercial dust bath products are most commonly used to keep chinchillas clean. Chinchillas love taking dust baths and will spend all their time in their dust bath houses or bowls if allowed. This is why, unlike a bottle of water, the dust bath house or bowl should only be left in your chinchilla's enclosure for 10-15 minutes, each time you want it to take a bath.</p><h2>Why Don't Chinchillas Like Water? </h2><p>Chinchillas instinctively know that they should roll around in dust to keep their fur clean and fluffy. Taking a bath in water is simply not something chinchillas do since they have other means to cool off and stay clean. The Andes mountains are rocky and arid in many parts, including where chinchillas naturally live. They are built to withstand cool, dry climates so excessive moisture and heat will only cause them problems. Chinchillas cannot pant or sweat so they rely on their large ears that don't have much fur to cool off. But just because chinchillas don't like warm climates and taking water baths, doesn't mean they don't drink water. In the wild, these rodents get most of their water from cacti and other plants but as pets, chinchillas need water bottles to stay hydrated.</p><h2>What Happens if You Get a Chinchilla Wet? </h2><p>If a chinchilla gets wet, the fur is so dense that it does an excellent job of holding the moisture in. The fur therefore takes a very long time to dry and, if the moisture stays in it long enough, fungi can start to multiply and cause a skin infection. This infection is not to be confused with the other fur problems that can occur in chinchillas, like fur-slip and fur-chewing. Fur fungus is the result of your chinchilla's fur staying wet for too long; fur-slip is a defense mechanism where your chinchilla releases its fur in an attempt to escape being captured; and fur-chewing occurs when a chinchilla chews on its own or another chinchilla's fur. Additionally, if the fur stays wet and your chinchilla gets too chilled, it could develop a respiratory infection. Fur fungus requires antifungal treatments and it can cause hair loss, itching, and crusting of the skin. Plus, your chinchilla may even spread the infection to other animals and people.</p><h2>What Should You Do If Your Chinchilla Gets Wet? </h2><p>If your chinchilla accidentally gets wet, gently towel dry it as best you can. Place your chinchilla on towels in front of a fan set on low or a hair dryer that has a cool setting to provide constant, cool airflow. This may take a long time depending on how wet your chinchilla was. Make sure your chinchilla does not get too cold during this slow drying process, though. Once your chinchilla feels dry, let it take a dust bath to help absorb the excess moisture on the skin.</p><h2>Is It Ever Okay For a Chinchilla to Get Wet? </h2><p>While a drop or two of water isn't going to cause a problem, you should avoid soaking your chinchilla's fur whenever possible. Occasionally, there are emergency situations that require a chinchilla to get a water bath. These situations usually involve your chinchilla getting urine, cleaners, or other potentially harmful products on them that require rinsing.</p>",787

However, there have been many discussions over the safety of these materials among exotic pet owners and advocates. Are these items really dangerous to the animals for which they are marketed?</p><h2>Concerns With Cedar Chips and Pine Shavings </h2><p>Cedar and pine became popular as pet bedding materials because they are good at controlling odor and have some natural insecticidal properties (they kill or repel bugs like lice, especially the cedar chips). These softwood shavings also smell nice due to the volatile compounds (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols) that are given off. Unfortunately, though, these compounds are thought to posea potential health risk, especially with regards to respiratory problems (asthma, inflammation, allergic responses) and changes in the liver.</p><h2>Studies on Wood Toxicity </h2><p>Many of the studies on wood toxicity have been conducted on humans who are exposed to these woods and their by-products in the wood product industry (such as those who work in lumber mills who are exposed to lots of wood dust). These studies often compare the incidence of disease in workers in the wood product industry compared to other workers or the average population. This is a much different type of exposure compared to that of our pets who are not breathing in dust particles from milled wood.</p><p>Studies of laboratory animals have shown fairly dramatic changes in liver enzymes ofanimals housed on cedar bedding though. These changes, in turn, can affect the metabolism of drugs in the liver, including anesthetics, but there is not much information on a direct link between these changes and disease or clinical symptoms. The changes in liver enzymes can be problematic for research animals but the impact on pets hasn't be studied well.</p><h2>The Bottom Line With Wood Shavings </h2><p>Based on the studies that have shownconcern with the compounds in the cedar chips that may cause changes within the body, it seems it is best to avoid usingcedaras bedding or litter for our pets, especially since alternatives are readily available.</p><p>With pine shavings, the problem isn't as clear cut though. Pine shavings emit similar volatile compounds as cedar chips but the risks aren't clear. It is thought that heat-treating pine shavings may reduce the levels of aromatic hydrocarbons that have been shownas a potential concern. Therefore, products such as kiln-dried pine are safe (many pet products are heat-treated like this). Other experts report skin sensitivities, itching, or allergies to pine shavings and their pets so it might be irritating to their skin despite being safe for the respiratory tract and liver.</p><p>Since the information about the problems with wood shavings is circumstantial and hasn't been evaluated in the context of health problems in exotic pets, it is hard to make firm recommendations. But, if you have access to other types of pet bedding it is recommended to use them over wood shavings so you don't have to worry about potential risks.</p><h2>Other Bedding Options </h2><p>The concerns over pet bedding safety seem to have led to a bit of an explosion of alternative bedding products on the market. As far as wood shavings go, aspen is a good option that is widely available. There is an increasing number of other litter or pellet type products on the market now, which are appropriate for use as bedding or in litter boxes. The best option for you depends on the type of animal you are caring for and what the litter is used for. Some of the harder pellet products might be better used in the litter box of a ferret or a rabbit, while the softer types of bedding or litter are good for the smaller pets that need their cage bottom filled, like hamsters. However, even some of the pelleted products can be used as a substrate or bedding for rodents, especially as a cage liner with some softer bedding provided as a top layer.</p><p>Some alternatives include paper-based pellets and fluff like Carefresh Ultra (an absorbent bedding that also holds together well so the wet parts can easily be scooped out), litters made from a variety of other organic materials (e.g. cherry/maple wood, aspen wood or bark, grain by-products, wood pulp fibers), and even paper strips (which are soft, but not very absorbent). Another often overlooked alternative is alfalfa pellets (e.g. rabbit food) which are cheap and fairly absorbent. Many options exist and most of them are less of a risk to your pet than wood shavings.</p>",781
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/diarrhea-in-ferrets-4582654,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Diarrhea in Ferrets</h1>,"<h1>Diarrhea in Ferrets</h1><p>Ferrets, just like other pets, are unfortunately prone to several ailments, and diarrhea is a common one. Diarrhea in ferrets can be a serious issue since it can quickly cause dehydration,but sometimes it's temporary and simply the result of dietary indiscretion. By knowing more about the causes of diarrhea in ferrets, you'll be able to help prevent it and keep both your ferret and whoever cleans the litter box happier.</p><h2>Causes of Diarrhea in Ferrets </h2><p>Diarrhea is defined as a frequent, liquid form of stool. There are a variety of reasons why a ferret may develop diarrhea and not only is it a mess for you to clean up (in both the litter box andon your ferret), but it can mean there is a bigger problem with your ferret. Diarrhea is often the symptom of a disease that affects the intestinal tract and some of these diseases can be very serious.</p><h3>Infectious Disease </h3><p>Infectious disease is a common cause of diarrhea in ferrets, whether that is bacterial, fungal, or viral in nature. A disease called epizootic catarrhal enteritis, or ""green slime disease"", is a viral disease that can cause diarrhea in older ferrets when a new ferret is introduced to a household. This is due to younger ferrets being a carrier for this coronavirus. Another disease that is thought to have some correlation to bacterial diseases is inflammatory bowel disease, IBD, which can result in ""bird seed"" feces that have undigested food particles in it. Ferrets with this disease also tend to lose weight over time with IBD if left untreated. Regardless of bacterial, fungal, or viral causes, have you ferret checked out by a veterinarian to get the appropriate treatment!</p><h2>Intestinal Parasites </h2><p>Diagnosing your ferret with intestinal parasites can sometimes be difficult, even for your veterinarian. Microscopic evaluations of your ferret's fecal matter may reveal worms, protozoans, parasite eggs, and other forms of intestinal intruders. These problematic parasites often affect the intestinal lining of your ferret and can cause diarrhea.</p><p>Coccidia is the most common type of intestinal parasite in ferrets. Coccidia are microscopic protozoans that are invisible to the naked eye. These parasites hang out in a ferret's intestinal tract and cause diarrhea, as well as weight loss and other symptoms if left untreated. A diagnosis of coccidiosis can be made by your veterinarian who will need one or multiple fecal samples in order to run tests to find this tiny parasite.</p><h2>Dietary Changes </h2><p>If your ferret eats a food that they don't normally eat, then they can develop diarrhea as a result of the dietary change. This type of diarrhea is usually short-lived but it can still be concerning and messy. Ferrets may find food on the ground, steal another pet's food, or simply get a new treat that can cause some diarrhea. Certain foods are also more likely to cause diarrhea in ferrets. Foods that are high in fat or contain a lot of oil are likely to cause loose stools as opposed to food items that are high in fiber or bland.</p><h2>Foreign Bodies </h2><p>Whenever a ferret eats an object that it shouldn't, that item is then considered a foreign body. Ferrets are known to chew on and swallow small items out of curiosity. Small rubber and plastic items, hair ties, coins, ear plugs, and even hairballs can become foreign bodies. If these items then get stuck, they can also cause an obstruction in a ferret, which is a very serious matter. Diarrhea, if incompletely obstructed, or lack of feces overall, a common symptom of a complete blockage by a foreign body, are clinical signs of obstructions since these items disrupt a normal digestive tract. Ferrets may also start vomiting, lose their appetite, and become lethargic if the foreign body becomes stuck or emits toxins.</p><h2>Cancer </h2><p>It's a word that no one wants to hear but unfortunately, cancer is quite common in pet ferrets. Lymphoma is one type of cancer that can cause diarrhea since it may affect the digestive tract of a ferret, but other types of cancer can also exhibit this symptom.</p><h2>Stress </h2><p>Just like in many other species, if a ferret is stressed, it may have diarrhea. This is not uncommon during a vet visit, in a carrier during transport, or after a ferret goes to a new home. Once the ferret relaxes, the stress diarrhea usually subsides, so if that happens, it's a good indication that stress was the reason for the loose stool to begin with.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Depending on the reason for diarrhea, it may resolve without any intervention, or your ferret may need veterinary help.</p>",763
69,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cages-for-sugar-gliders-1237336,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Cages for Sugar Gliders</h1>,"<h1>Cages for Sugar Gliders</h1><h2>Setting up a home for your sugar gliders</h2><p>0</p><p>Sugar gliders are active little animals and need lots of room in their cage. Since they need to climb and jump, the amount of vertical space is more important than the actual square footage of the cage.</p><p>A good minimum size for a pair of sugar gliders is 24 inches deep by 24 inches wide by 36 inches tall. Larger is always better, keeping in mind that height is important for the gliders. The spacing of the wire should be no more than 1/2 inch by 1 inch. If you use a cage that is not wire mesh, make sure it has horizontal bars with spaces no more than 1/2 inch. Cages that provide a couple of platforms are nice.</p><p>Since commercial cages do not often come in the dimensions preferred for sugar gliders, many owners fashion cages of welded wire. Glider Central provides several links to pages with instructions on how to build cages at home. A nice idea is to make a cage that sits inside a tray (plastic or metal) that is a few inches larger than the floor space of the cage to catch any wastes that fall outside of the cage.</p><p>The latch on the cage should be secure, as gliders will sometimes learn how to open latches and let themselves out. A layer of shavings (never cedar; aspen or fir is best) in the bottom of the cage will help absorb waste and should be cleaned out once or twice a week (more often if needed, depending on how many you have).</p><p>The cage should be placed in an accessible spot in the home, but out of direct sunlight and in an area free from drafts. They do best a temperature slightly higher than room temperature, in the rage of 70 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Nest Boxes </h2><p>Your sugar gliders need a nest box, which can be bought or homemade. Many people advocate nest boxes made from porous materials, which breathe a bit and absorb moisture. Materials such as wood and unglazed clay pots (with holes in the side) fall under this category. They do have the disadvantage of absorbing urine and other wastes, so they will need to be discarded and replaced occasionally. Nest boxes of plastic are easier to clean and are an acceptable alternative. Placing the nest box against the ceiling of the cage will prevent the gliders from sitting on and defecating on top of the box.</p><p>A third option, which is a favorite of many gliders, is a cloth pouch. These can be affixed to the sides of the cage easily, and are washable, so you can have a spare and wash/replace them as necessary. These are also nice as they help with the taming and bonding process as you can remove the pouch, sugar gliders and all, from the cage if you wish to handle them.</p><p>Unless a cloth bag is used, some bedding material should be provided as well. A piece of cloth is often easiest and works well, but monitor and remove any loose threads.</p><h2>Furnishings and Toys </h2><p>Sugar gliders like to climb and jump, and you should provide lots of branches to allow them to exercise. Fresh branches are appreciated, but make sure they are free from pesticides and fertilizers and are from non-toxic plants. Avoid branches from coniferous trees such as pine and cedar due to the sticky sap produced by these trees. Ropes and ladders can provide additional climbing opportunities.</p><p>Wooden toys, such as those made for birds and rodents, make good toys for sugar gliders. Toys placed high in the cage will be most appreciated as gliders like to spend their time high up in the cage. Cloth toys are best avoided or at least regularly checked for loose threads that could entangle the gliders or be ingested.</p><p>An exercise wheel, if introduced to young gliders, may be a big hit and allow lots of opportunities for exercise. A larger wheel, with a solid surface, is best so that legs and tails do not get caught. Some people also use the clear plastic globes that you can put your pet in to let them roll around the house.</p><h2>Food Dishes </h2><p>Plastic bird dishes that hang on the side of the cage are probably easiest. They should be fairly large, but not so large that the gliders can climb into them and soil them. Water can be provided in a bottle, but if the gliders are not trained to a water bottle, provide another clip on a dish for water until you are sure your gliders are taking water from the bottle consistently.</p>",774

Not only do they eat a very different type of food when compared to other pocket pets, but they are covered with tiny little spikes and roll into balls when scared. Keeping a hedgehog as a bed requires special needs, like housing and food, so read on to discover the best way to care for a pet hedgehog. </p><h2>Hedgehog Statistics </h2><h2>Hedgehog Diet </h2><p>Unlike most other pocket pets, hedgehogs are considered insectivores, and these snouted critters have quite the taste for things that creep and crawl. Mealworms and crickets are the most commonly fed insects in captivitybut the staple diet for a hedgehog should be a store-bought, specially formulated hedgehog kibble. It's important, especially if your kibble brand doesn't have insects in the pellets, to supplement with live insects, such as mealworms and crickets, and veggies.</p><p>Many owners and breeders still feed kitten food to their hedgehogs but this is not ideal because cat food does not contain blood meal and chitin in it.</p><h2>Keeping Hedgehogs as Pets </h2><p>As their name implies, African Pygmy hedgehogs are native to central and eastern Africa but most of these hedgehogs are actually a hybrid of two species: the Four-toed and Algerian hedgehogs. In the wild, they also live primarily off of small insects, grubs, snails, spiders, and small vertebrates a diet you should strive to mimic in captivity.</p><p>Cages made for guinea pigs and rabbits are suitable for hedgehogs but wire-grate cage bottoms should be avoided since hedgehogs have small feet that will be injured if they fall through these grates. Soft bedding such as recycled paper material or towels that are changed out regularly is best for the sensitive feet of ahedgehog. Good padding for the cage is key; wire-bottom or plastic grates can lead to callus formation on the feet, which can lead to foot infections known as pododermatitis. You might consider fleece or dog-training potty pads over the soft padding or fleece to easily clean certain areas.</p><p>A large enclosed running wheel should be kept in the cagefor your hedgie to exercise in along with a hide box, food bowl, and water bottle. Make sure the running wheel is cleaned regularly to avoid fecal matter from building up which can cause foot infections or infections in humans upon handling them.</p><p>Hedgehogs are very active at night and will run several miles a day on their wheel or in their enclosed play area. If they are unable to get a large amount of exercise they require they may become depressed, overweight, and develop foot sores. Exercise and activity are very important to hedgehogs so potential owners should be able to commit to being able to provide a hedgehog with the space necessary to do so.</p><h2>Handling Hedgehogs </h2><p>African pygmy hedgehogs obviously have a lot of prickly spines but that doesn't mean they aren't fun to hold. Tame hedgehogs will crawl into your hands, take treats from you and even enjoy being carried for a bit. Younger hedgehogs are easier to tame than older ones, therefore your best chance to have a hedgehog that loves being held is by getting one at about six to eight weeks of age.</p><p>Typically, hedgehogs don't like their heads being pet and will roll into spiked balls when scared. Since hedgehogsaren't big fans of water, if you are having trouble cleaning your hedgehog's feet, try placing it in a shallow bath that only covers their feet.</p><h2>Hedgehog Health </h2><p>Dental disease, skin issues including mite and lice infestations, intestinal parasites, and tumors can all be issues for pet hedgehogs. Spaying and neutering are recommended to avoid reproductive organ tumors and other diseases later in life. Thorough dental examinations at the yearly vet visits and the occasional dental cleaning under anesthesia are recommended to prevent your hedgie from losing any teeth or developing other dental problems. Some owners are able to brush their hedgehog's teeth using cat toothpaste and a small head toothbrush or cotton-tipped applicatorweekly but this is very uncommon.</p><p>Obesity is another common issue with these pets; make sure you feed the recommended amount of food according to the diet they are using.</p><p>Spine loss is normal in small amounts but if your hedgehog is losing so many spines that ithas bald patches it probably has a medical concern. Parasite infestations such as mites are the most common reasons for excessive spine loss. If your hedgehog is losing a lot of spines then it's time for a check-up with the vet.</p>",755

There's no way to know for sure how certain animal personalities will mesh, but there are some hedgehog characteristics and temperaments that can help you figure out if they might be a good fit.</p><p>They might not be as cuddly as dogs and cats (you can thank their quills for that), but hedgehogs are low-maintenance pets that usually quite enjoy spending their days alongside humans. Here's what to know about their preferences toward other animals, as well as the personality traits that can help you determine if they'll be a match for your current brood and vice versa.</p><h2>Hedgehog Temperament </h2><p>Hedgehogs have a few unique quirks that separate them from other small pets.</p><p>For starters, hedgehogs are nocturnal, meaning they sleep during the day and are most active at night. They also take a while to warm up to social interactions, which means you'll have to be patient and very gentle as your hedgehog gets used to living with you in your home.</p><p>Hedgehogs aren't known to be aggressive, but they do have some defense mechanisms that might come into play when they feel threatened. This includes curling up in a spiky ball, or twitching and jumping in such a way that their quills can poke a potential predator.</p><p>All of this means that the temperament of your current pet(s) is going to be just as important as the temperament of your hedgehog when it comes to whether they can get along. A dog, cat, or other animal who can learn to respect a hedgehog's space, especially when they're on the defense, is much more likely to be a successful roommate than one who is constantly up in their business.</p><h2>Hedgehogs and Other Pets </h2><p>Hedgehogs certainly can get along with other pets, but it's worth reiterating that this is highly dependent on the personalities of both animals in question. For this reason, it's crucial that you supervise interactions closely until you can be sure that all of your pets feel comfortable with each other.</p><p>With that in mind, are there some types of pets that hedgehogs are more likely to get along with than others? Here's the general consensus.</p><h3>Hedgehogs and Hedgehogs </h3><p>If you already have a hedgehog and you want another, you're in luck. Hedgehogs seem to get along fairly well with their other hedgehog peers, though as always, personality and temperament are two major factors.</p><p>Keep your hedgehogs separated in different cages until you can be sure they get along, though do put their cages near each other so that they can (safely) start to get used to each other's presence.</p><h3>Hedgehogs and Other Types of Pets </h3><p>Cats typically seem to quickly develop a healthy respect for the quills of a hedgehog, and keep a respectful distance. Dogs, too, are generally quite wary of the hedgehog's armor, though care must be taken with large, boisterous, or highly prey-driven dogs, who could quickly injure a hedgehog with rough play despite the quills.</p><p>Other small pets are usually not a problem, either. If your hedgehog seems stressed by encounters with any other pets (such as urinating or defecating in fear), then restrict contact until you can find a solution. And as a good rule of thumb, never let other pets harass your hedgehog when they're in or out of their cage.</p><h2>How to Introduce Your Hedgehog to Other Pets </h2><p>Safety is always the first priority any time you are introducing any animal to another. Keep in mind that hedgehogs are solitary by nature, and may not be open to forming a friendship with another pet, though they may still be able to tolerate them.</p><p>Make sure that your hedgehog is comfortable with you first before opening up the introductions to other pets. This way, you'll be able to securely hold your hedgehog in your arms during their initial meetings, which should offer both them and you a sense of much-needed security.</p><p>Start with small interactions when your other pet is nice and calm. Dogs and cats will generally be quite curious about your new friend, but a quick prick to the nose (if they get too close) should be enough to teach them a bit of respect. If your other pet is coming on too strong, or if your hedgehog seems overly stressed, cut off the interaction and try again another time.</p><p>There are some specific best practices you'll want to follow when introducing hedgehogs to other hedgehogs.</p>",766
72,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guinea-pig-bladder-stones-1238880,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>Guinea Pig Bladder Stones</h1>,"<h1>Guinea Pig Bladder Stones</h1><p>Guinea pigs are prone to several health problems, and getting bladder stones are one of them. Guinea pig bladder stones are a painful problem that can be life-threatening. Once you know your pig has bladder stones, they should not be ignored.</p><h2>What Are Uroliths? </h2><p>Uroliths are also commonly referred to as bladder stones. Bladder stones in guinea pigs can be big or small and can stay in the bladder or get stuck in the urethra. Sometimes stones are so small that they can be passed when your guinea pig urinates, but sometimes they can get stuck in the urethra or cause irritation to the bladder tissue.</p><p>Uroliths are painful, can cause bloody urine, or even prevent a guinea pig from being able to urinate if they get stuck. They are basically small stones that, if unable to be urinated out, need to be surgically removed.</p><h2>How Do Guinea Pigs Get Uroliths? </h2><p>The pH of urine can change, and when it does, it can form crystals inside the bladder by using minerals and proteins within the urine. These crystals can eventually accumulate and form one or many stones, or uroliths. Diet and water intake may play a role in bladder stone formation, but just like in people, we don't know 100 percent of the time what causes guinea pig bladder stones to form.</p><h2>Can Bladder Stones be Prevented? </h2><p>Since we don't know what exactly causes bladder stones, it is difficult to say how to prevent them. You can start by making sure your guinea pig diet is the best it can be. Offer clean water and make sure your cavy is drinking it. More dilute urine has a less likely chance of forming stones. Reduce the amount of high calcium-containing plants in your guinea pigs greens- like spinach and kale.</p><h2>How to Know If a Guinea Pig Has a Urolith </h2><p>If your cavy is urinating blood, has a painful abdomen, vocalizes while attempting to go to the bathroom, or is not urinating normally or at all, your pig may have a urolith. An exotics vet will be able to positively diagnose your guinea pig with bladder stones after doing a physical examination and possibly a urinalysis and/or radiographs (x-rays).</p><p>If a stone is present, it might show up on the radiograph, and a urinalysis will tell the vet if there is an bacteria in the bladder, blood in the urine, or crystals present that need to be treated. Never ignore anything strange that your guinea pig does. If you think something just isn't right, even if you can't put your finger on it, it is best to have your pig checked out by a vet. They are trained to find things you don't.</p><h2>What to Do If a Guinea Pig Has a Bladder Stone </h2><p>Your options may vary depending on a few factors. If your cavy has one or several bladder stones in his bladder that are too large for him to urinate out, surgery is your one option to save him. Even if the guinea pig doesn't have an issue when the stones are discovered, they could cause a block later on, depending on the stones shape/size, this could be uncomfortable. Supportive care can be elected until the stone results in blockage then either surgery or euthanasia will be discussed.</p><p>If there is a stone stuck in the trigone (where the bladder turns into the urethra) or the urethra, your vet may try to remove it under sedation or try to push it back up into the bladder by using a catheter so that your guinea pig can at least urinate for the time being or before going to surgery. Sometimes, during this process, the stone or catheter tears the urethra and complications arise that require surgery.</p><p>This is a bad situation called uroabdomen, where the urine backs up and goes into the abdomen of the guinea pig. Euthanasia or emergency surgery, with a specialist, should be elected at this point.</p><p>If the stones are really small, your vet may have you increase your pig's water intake to help flush them out of his body before they are too big that he can't.</p><p>Regardless of your specific bladder stone situation, guinea pigs that have stones should be kept as comfortable and as stress-free as possible. If your guinea pig lives with another pig, bring that pig along to the vet and ask your vet for guinea pig specific pain medications and/or anti-inflammatories. Depending on the situation, you can help your guinea pig through this by just giving a little extra TLC. You might also consider surgery to remove any stones.</p>",769
73,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-long-do-hamsters-sleep-5195039,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>How Long Do Hamsters Sleep?</h1>,"<h1>How Long Do Hamsters Sleep?</h1><p>The hamster is a very popular caged pet and is often the first pet a child has, but how does a hamster's sleep cycle impact pet owners? Additionally, how do you know if a hamster's sleep cycle is normal to begin with? Knowing the answers to these questions can help you decide if a hamster is the right pet for you as well as how to monitor your hamster's health and environment based on its sleep cycle.</p><h2>How Long Do Hamsters Sleep? </h2><p>Hamsters usually sleep for about 12-14 hours a day but, unlike humans who typically sleep once a day, hamsters have polyphasic sleep-wake patterns. This means that they sleep multiple times a day so this 12-14 hours will be broken up into smaller segments throughout the day.</p><h2>Hamster Sleep Cycle </h2><p>Hamsters, especially Syrian or golden hamsters, have been the subjects of numerous circadian rhythm sleep studies, so the sleep cycle of hamsters is well-researched. Humans spend up to 25% of their time sleeping in the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep and studies show that hamsters also enter this phase of sleep for about the same amount of time. The REM phase is often known as the part of sleep where a person dreams, but despite the research that has been performed, it is not known whether or not hamsters dream like people dream. You may, however, see your hamster twitching its paws or eyes slightly which many people think may be a sign of some sort of dreaming or other brain activity. Do not be alarmed if you see these movements while your hamster is asleep.</p><p>Another important thing to know about a hamster's sleep cycle is that they are nocturnal in captivity. This means they are active at night and sleep during the day, which is the opposite of what most people do. Some people of course work at night so like hamsters, they will also sleep during the day. But for most hamster owners, their hamsters will be most active while they are fast asleep in their beds.</p><h2>What If Your Hamster Is Sleeping More Than Usual? </h2><p>If your hamster is sleeping more than usual it may be hibernating or sick. Hibernation can occur if your hamster is housed in a cold environment that routinely drops below 50 degrees. While most homes don't get this cold, if your hamster's cage is near an outside wall with poor insulation or a drafty door or window, its cage may be colder than the rest of your house. Make sure your hamster is warm enough before assuming it is sick.</p><p>If your hamster's cage is always over 50 degrees and it is sleeping more than usual, there is a good chance that it is sick. Respiratory and digestive issues are common in hamsters and if yours isn't feeling well, it may be lethargic and sleep more often than not. A visit to your veterinarian may be in order if you think your hamster is sick.</p><p>If your hamster's cage is always over 50 degrees and it isn't sick, it may simply be getting older and sleeping more. Older hamsters do not sleep as deeply or intensely as younger hamsters therefore they sleep more often. This is a completely normal thing and is not of concern.</p><h2>Is It Okay to Wake Up Your Hamster? </h2><p>Since hamsters sleep an upwards of 14 hours a day, there may come a time when you need to wake your hamster from its slumber or you accidentally awaken it from nap time. Startling your hamster should be avoided if at all possible as this could cause your hamster to bite you and disturb its normal sleep-wake cycle. If this happens on a regular basis, it could stress your hamster and contribute to health issues as well. Unless you need to administer medications or something else that is time-sensitive, it's best to try and interact with your hamster only when it is already awake, rather than trying to make it adjust to your schedule.</p>",666
74,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-hamsters-make-great-pets-5101101,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>7 Reasons Why Hamsters Make Great Pets</h1>,"<h1>7 Reasons Why Hamsters Make Great Pets</h1><h2>Is this pocket-sized pet right for you?</h2><p> </p><p>While the decision to bring home any new pet requires careful consideration, hamsters can make great pets for almost any responsible family based on their modest space and care requirements.</p><p>To help decide if this is the right pet for you, consider these seven reasons to bring home a hamster.</p><h2>1. Hamsters Don't Require Extensive Training </h2><p>Unlike cats or dogs, hamsters do not require extensive training. No litter box training or obedience courses are needed!</p><p>Hamsters do, however, benefit from regular socializing and handling to help them get to know you. If you are looking for a lower-maintenance furry companion, a hamster may be just the pet for you.</p><h2>2. Typically, Hamsters are Inexpensive Pets to Own </h2><p>On top of being low-maintenance, buying a hamster won't break the bank. Though you must consider the cumulative cost of all the supplies needed to care for a happy hamster, the overall expense will be far less than adopting a cat or dog.</p><p>Once the initial one-time costs are covered, such as the cage, hamsters are relatively cheap to upkeep. You won't be spending much per month on hamster food, treats, and bedding. Of course, as with any pet, there can be unforeseen costs, like vet bills, that you will need to be prepared for. Prior to getting a hamster, research exotic animal veterinarians in your area to see where the closest vet is to you and if you are willing to drive to the clinic in case your pet gets sick.</p><h2>3. Hamsters are Cute and Entertaining </h2><p>Who doesn't love a hamster's adorable fuzzy features and tiny size? These cuties are a joy to watch play and clean themselves.</p><p>From running in their wheels to exercising in a ball, each hamster has its own unique personality and watching them enjoy their favorite activities can provide endless entertainment.</p><h2>4. Hamsters Are Great Pets For Night Owls </h2><p>Hamsters are nocturnal, meaning they are most active during the night. Though this could be seen as a negative, this is perfect for any people who keep late hours. Are you looking for a late-night movie companion or someone to keep you company while everyone else is in bed? A hamster could be the perfect night time friend.</p><h2>5. Hamsters Require Minimal Space </h2><p>Unlike dogs, cats, or even rabbits, hamsters really only need a few feet to live in. You can easily make room for a hamster cage on a desk or dresser, making them the perfect pet for those who live in small houses or apartments.</p><p>However, don't be shy about taking your hamster out for regular playtime. With supervision, hamsters love to explore. Getting them a hamster ball is a perfect way to let them burn off some energy. Plus, they are so much fun to watch roll around.</p><h2>6. Hamsters Don't Require Constant Attention </h2><p>Though they can enjoy quality playtime spent with their people, providing they have enough space and entertaining toys, hamsters are usually content being left alone in their cage. Time for training, daily walks, and long grooming sessions aren't needed to care for a happy hamster. They don't need the kind of attention and human interaction that dogs and cats do.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that failure to socialize your hamster (especially early in its life) may make it more shy or hesitant to be handled.</p><h2>7. Hamsters are Easy to Clean up After </h2><p>Hamsters are clean animals, so you will rarely ever have to bathe yours unless you have to wash something off of them. They are generally fastidious about personal hygiene and regularly clean themselves to keep tidy. Not only does this mean that you have less work, but it is also adorable to watch them undertaking their little cleaning rituals.</p><p>Hamsters are also quite good housekeepers. They usually choose one corner of their cage to be their bathroom, which keeps the rest of the cage relatively clean. This makes tidying up their home a breeze in comparison to some rodents!</p><p>With so many things to love about hamsters, it is no wonder they make such popular pets. Without much cost, time, or space, you can keep an adorable little companion to call your own.</p><p>Although they may be easier to care for than some other pets, it doesn't mean that a hamster is right for every household. Very noisy households or ones with lots of other pets could be stressful or a risk for a hamster. And keeping any pet requires time, patience and dedication. If you can offer these things, then a hamster could be the perfect pet for you.</p>",759
75,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchilla-ileus-1238229,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Chinchillas and Ileus (Gastrointestinal Stasis)</h1>,"<h1>Chinchillas and Ileus (Gastrointestinal Stasis)</h1><p>Chinchillas are very sensitive rodents and can develop ileus, also known as gastrointestinal stasis. Ileus is when the intestines stop moving the normal ingesta through the colon and out through the rectum resulting in the bacteria to produce excess gas. This can be very painful for your chinchilla, and you will need prescribed medications or veterinary help to relieve it from the pain. It's crucial to recognize the signs and symptoms of ileus, so you can act fast if you chinchilla gets sick.</p><h2>What Is Ileus? </h2><p>When the intestines of a chinchilla stop moving the normal ingesta through the colon and out through the rectum, it is called ileus, or gastrointestinal stasis. A chinchilla should always be eating and pooping but when they stop doing one or both, the bacteria inside the intestines start producing excessive gas. This large amount of gas is painful (you should know if you've ever had bad gas!) and prevents your chin from wanting to eat more. Since chinchillas cannot vomit we need to help them work the gas, and whatever food that may remain inside, out of their bodies using medications and stimulation. </p><h2>Medications Used for Ileus </h2><p>Your exotics vet may have a combination of drugs that work for them or they may want to try a few different things. Regardless of what specific medication that is prescribed there are usually certain types of drugs that work well to relieve the symptoms of ileus.</p><p>Gut motility drugs, such as metoclopramide (Reglan) or cisapride are usually prescribed along with pain medication. Drugs to decrease the amount of gas, such as simethicone (Gas-X), are sometimes recommended, as well as probiotics and other medications. Force-feeding if your rabbit isn't eating is a must since food needs to be put in to get poops coming out.</p><h2>Food </h2><p>Oxbow Critical Care is a popular and effective choice for rabbits with ileus. It is more nutritionally complete than other similar products and chinchillas typically like it. It is fed using a syringe and comes in two flavors, anise (the original flavor) and an apple-banana flavor. It is a powdered hay formula that you add water to so it can be pushed through a syringe.</p><p>If your rabbit won't take Critical Care or you do not have access to any, ground up chinchilla pellets mixed with water, or mixed vegetable baby food (without potato or starch in it) are alternatives. Your vet will tell you how much food you should syringe feed your chin but it will probably be about 10 to 20 ml's twice a day or so. If your chin is eating a little on his own you should syringe feed less to encourage him to continue eating without assistance.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Chinchillas should eat a pile of grass hay (timothy, orchard, Bermuda, etc.) the size of their body a day (if not more). Alfalfa hay is too high in calcium to offer as the sole hay source but offering it mixed in with the grass hay is fine. Chinchilla pellets are the least important part of a pet chinchilla's diet. A pet chinchilla can get one to two tablespoons of pellets daily, no more. Fruit is considered a treat but also isn't recommended and broccoli, cauliflower, and other gas-forming vegetables should especially be avoided.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>A chinchilla who may have ileus should also be encouraged to exercise. Create ample and safe space for your chin to run around in or at the very least, massage your chin's belly to encourage his guts to move food through.</p><h2>Other Diseases with Ileus </h2><p>Your chinchilla may have another medical reason for why it is not eating or pooping. Its teeth may be overgrown, it may have a bladder stone, or it may just be stressed out. Chinchillas can have hernias and ileus at the same time. It is important to diagnose the reason why your chinchilla has ileus and not just treat the ileus, otherwise, it may just happen again or the ileus may not go away.</p><p>If you start seeing small stools don't stop your efforts. Until your chinchilla is eating and pooping normally you should treat him as an ileus case. With quick action and proper treatment, your chinchilla will be back to normal in no time at all. Ileus can be deadly if left untreated so within 24 hours of your chinchilla not eating or pooping you should be starting treatment. If you can't get into an exotics vet in that time frame, start by syringe feeding (mixed vegetable baby food or Critical Care) and offering water in a dish or by syringe.</p>",759
76,https://www.thesprucepets.com/caring-for-rabbits-while-on-vacation-1239285,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Caring for Rabbits While on Vacation</h1>,"<h1>Caring for Rabbits While on Vacation</h1><p>Vacation should be about fun and relaxation, not responsibility. But you still need to think about your pets while taking a break from the real world. Pet rabbits need regular care and shouldn't slip your mind while you are taking a much-needed rest. Thankfully, there are a few options for rabbit owners to get the care their pets need without giving up the fun of vacation.</p><h2>Pet Sitters for Rabbits</h2><p>Rabbits need daily care, playtime, food, and water. An overnight trip may not require a pet sitter, but anything longer than a 24-hour getaway will require care for your rabbit. Pet sitters are often available to come into your home or to bring your rabbit to their own residence to provide this care. Depending on your level of comfort with a pet sitter, you may want to take a few extra steps to ensure a relaxing getaway.</p><p>If you don't have a dedicated rabbit room and do not feel comfortable or trust your sitter 100 percent to watch your rabbits closely during their out of cage time, you may just want to have your pet sitter handle your bunny without letting them run around a room too much. A detailed instruction list for what to do and not do can be left for the sitter to reference and also contain emergency contact numbers, including your exotics vet.</p><p>If you don't have any close friends or family that are willing to stop by and care for your rabbit, consider asking them if you can bring them to their house for them to watch. If you don't know anyone personally who is comfortable caring for your rabbit in your absence, check out reputable pet-sitting websites for an experienced pet sitter near you, ask around your neighborhood for kids who like to pet sit, call your local exotics vet to see if any employees would like to make a little extra cash, contact a local rabbit rescue group, or check with your local trusted pet store to see if they know of anyone willing to watch your rabbit.</p><p>Make sure the sitter you find has an environment similar to yours. For example, if they have any other pets your rabbit is not used to, this could stress out the rabbit.</p><h2>Boarding Facilities for Rabbits </h2><p>Some dog and cat boarding facilities will board exotic pets, including rabbits, for a nominal fee per day. Daily feedings, medication administration, play times, and other needs can be delivered by trained staff, but you may need need to transport your own enclosure and supplies to the facility. A simple phone call to ask the place if they will be willing to board your rabbit is all it takes.</p><p>Many facilities may be willing to board a rabbit, but it's important that facility has experience with that pet. If you rabbit is in a facility that cannot provide your rabbit with what it needs or does not have experience with rabbits, this could lead to stress for the pet. Stress can cause ileus in rabbits and medical emergencies are never fun to deal with, especially if you are out of town.</p><h2>Vacationing With Your Rabbit </h2><p>If you are driving to your vacation destination, you may want to consider bringing your pet rabbit along with you in the car. Depending on how many rabbits you have and how large the enclosure is, this may or may not be very practical. One rabbit can be easily transported in a small carrier (but make sure they don't get too warm or cold while in transport) and then set back up in their enclosure at the place where you are staying. Campsites and other places that don't have access to electricity are not good options for vacationing with rabbits, as you wouldn't want your rabbit to overheat or get too cold. But if you are staying in pet-friendly hotels or with friends or family that don't mind a rabbit or two as company, you may be able to take your bunny along with you on vacation!</p><h2>Before You Leave </h2><p>Regardless of what you do with your rabbit while you are out of town, you should have your rabbit examined by your veterinarian prior to leaving. This will make sure your rabbit is healthy enough for someone else to watch it or to travel with you out of town.</p><p>Make sure you have enough food, treats, bedding, and litter for your rabbit for when you are out of town. Even if your rabbit is traveling with you, you won't want to go searching for supplies if you're vacationing.</p>",762
77,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rat-teeth-1238497,Small Pets > Pet Rats,<h1>Problems with Rat Teeth</h1>,"<h1>Problems with Rat Teeth</h1><p>Pet rat teeth can be problematic. Not all exotic pets have problems with their teeth, but since rats have some teeth that grow continuously throughout their lives, these teeth may periodically require care. Knowing what to watch for in your pet rat's mouth can help avoid serious trauma to its mouth.</p><h2>What Kind of Teeth Do Rats Have? </h2><p>Dogs and cats are born with no teeth, develop deciduous or baby teeth, and then lose those teeth so that their adult teeth can take their place. Rats, on the other hand, only have one set of teeth their entire lives and these teeth appear in their mouths as young as eight to ten days of age. These teeth consist of twelve molars and four incisors and they remain in a pet rat's mouth for the rest of its life. The incisors continuously grow while the molars do not, but this continuous growth of the front teeth can cause problems for your rat.</p><h2>Examining Your Rat's Teeth </h2><p>The incisors of a rat are naturally colored yellow and are harder than a human's teeth. Their upper incisors should be about four millimeters long and their bottom incisors almost twice that length at seven millimeters long past the gumline. Much of the incisors are hidden underneath your rat's lips, therefore in order to get a good look at their teeth, you'll need to gently pull back their cheeks and lips to make sure the teeth aren't curling up and back into your rat's mouth or into the side of their cheek.</p><h2>Overgrown Rat Teeth </h2><p>The incisors, or front teeth, are easy to identify when they become overgrown. They will usually grow so long that they begin to curve and stick out between the lips where they can become stuck on things, or worse yet, grow into the gums or roof of your rat's mouth. The molars, or teeth in the back of the mouth, do not grow, so they are not a problem for rats like they can be in guinea pigs and rabbits.</p><p>Most rats will wear their incisors down appropriately when they gnaw on their food, but some rats are born with misaligned teeth, jaws, or suffer trauma at some point in their lives which inhibits normal gnawing action.</p><h2>Rat Tooth Trims </h2><p>If done correctly, tooth trims are not painful. There are two common methods used to trim incisors. The first is by using regular dog nail clippers to cut the tooth like you would a toenail. This method is not the preferred way to trim teeth though and an exotic animal veterinarian will highly recommend against this! There is a high risk of cracking or splitting the tooth, because of the force needed to use the clippers. This method can cause pain if the tooth is split up to the nerve or trimmed too short. It can also break the joint between the jaw bones and result in abnormal growth permanently.</p><p>The second method is by using a handheld rotary tool, like the Dremel, with a cut-off wheel to slice the excess tooth off. This method does require a bit more skill and anesthesia or sedation for rats since their mouths are so small but can be easily performed by a trained veterinary professional. By using a rotary tool, no trauma will occur to the tooth or nerve when cut, assuming it is done correctly. The only concerns are for trauma to the gums or lips if the wheel accidentally grazes them or if the tooth is trimmed too short. This is why it is necessary to anesthetize or sedate rats in order to properly and safely trim their teeth.</p><p>Owners of rats and other exotic pets with teeth that continuously grow must be aware of the possible complications regarding their pet's teeth. Without the proper attention, overgrown teeth can cause serious trauma, anorexia, infections, pain, and even death from the inability to chew and swallow. Thankfully, the problem of overgrown teeth is easily controlled with regular tooth trims and monitoring of tooth length.</p><h2>Preventing Overgrown Teeth in Rats </h2><p>The best way to keep your rat's teeth at a normal length is to provide them with something to chew on. Safe wood, rat pellets, and toys that allow a rat to gnaw will naturally wear these teeth down to a safe length. Sometimes rats are simply born with malformed teeth due to inbreeding though, and it may be difficult for them to properly chew and wear their teeth down.</p>",743

If dysecdysis occurs, it may indicate a problem in your reptile's environment or an underlying health issue. For example, if an enclosure is not adequately humidified or your reptile has askin parasite, it may develop dysecdysis and require manual skin removal. Vets can diagnose dysecdysis with a physical examination and create a treatment plan accordingly. The best way to prevent the condition is by maintaining the safest, healthiest enclosure space possible for your pet. </p><h2>What Is Dysecdysis? </h2><p>Dysecdysis is the abnormal shedding of a reptile's skin. While the condition can refer to any abnormality, it often manifests as the skin your reptile should shed, building up in layers. When dysecdysis occurs and a reptile sheds irregularly, health problems may arise. Knowing what's normal for your pet is essential to detect any abnormality. Dysecdysis most commonly occurs in snakes.</p><h2>Symptoms of Dysecdysis in Reptiles </h2><p>Dysecdysis will appear as skin buildup on your reptile's body. As soon as you notice shedding abnormalities, consult your vet.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Dysecdysis may be harder to notice in some reptiles that are naturally lighter in color, likebearded dragonsorleopard geckos. After your reptile sheds, a thorough inspection can help you spot the signs of skin buildup. The skin loses its sheen during shedding, so look for dull or pale shed remnants on your reptile's body. Skin buildup most commonly occurs in the armpits, feet, tail tips, eyes, and belly but can happen anywhere on your reptile. If the dead skin collects on the feet, individual toes, or the tail, blood circulation may become restricted and cause the appendages to die and fall off. Buildup on the eyes can cause difficulty seeing and eating, leading to eye infections or blindness if untreated.</p><h2>Causes of Dysecdysis </h2><p>There are several reasons why a reptile may not have a complete shed.</p><h2>Diagnosing Dysecdysis in Reptiles </h2><p>To diagnose dysecdysis, your vet will perform a physical examination of your reptile, examine its medical history, and ask questions concerning its husbandry. Typically, your vet will be able to diagnose dysecdysis by looking at your reptile with their naked eye and then will move on to determining the primary cause of the condition. If the explanation isn't attributable to problems with your reptile's enclosure, your vet may perform a series of tests and search for external parasites. </p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The best way to treat dysecdysis is to remove the skin following a softening, warm water soak. After about ten to thirty minutes of soaking, you should be able to peel off your reptile's buildup easily and gently. Be careful not to damage the healthy skin underneath the dead skin when removing the shed. You may use tweezers to help peel off small pieces of skin, and repeated application of ointment will helpretained eye capsfall off. You should never remove eye cap buildup with tweezers.</p><p>Your vet may recommend a humidity chamber for your reptile to help moisten and loosen the skin. You can make a humidity chamber using a spacious aquarium tank containing wet bath towels, placed atop a heater and covered with a light cloth.</p><h2>Prognosis for Reptiles With Dysecdysis </h2><p>Dysecdysis itself is easy to treat and has a quick recovery time, but the primary condition causing the abnormal shedding may carry a more complex prognosis. If your reptile's dysecdysis results from poor tank conditions, ensuring that you make the necessary changes to its environment is essential to its recovery. If dysecdysis is not treated, it can damage your reptile's eyesight, and lead to bacterial and fungal infections.</p><h2>How to Prevent Dysecdysis </h2><p>The best measure you can take to prevent dysecdysis is maintaining appropriate humidity levels in your tank and ensuring your reptile has adequate surfaces to rub up against. Placing a humidity hide box in your enclosure may be helpful. Additionally, provide your reptile with a well-rounded, vet-approved diet. Preventing dysecdysis is more straightforward than treating it, so always provide your reptile with proper care.</p><p>Dysecdysis is not typical in reptiles, but it can usually be prevented by providing adequate humidity for your pet and is easily treatable with at-home removal methods.</p><p>Yes, all reptiles can develop dysecdysis, but it is most common in snakes.</p><p>You should never use tweezers to remove the skin from your reptile's eye caps, as they can severely damage the eye. Instead, apply ointment for several days and wait for the skin to fall off.</p>",744
79,https://www.thesprucepets.com/myxomatosis-in-pet-rabbits-1239358,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Myxomatosis in Rabbits</h1>,"<h1>Myxomatosis in Rabbits</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Myxomatosis, sometimes referred to as myxi, is a serious viral disease that presents with severe symptoms in pet rabbits such as fever, lethargy, and inflamed eyes. Unlike bacterial infections that can be successfully treated with antibiotics, myxomatosis is not easily cured and is often rapidly fatal. There are no specific treatments, and supportive care is only occasionally successful in helping rabbits recover. However, preventative measures such as vaccination, flea repellents, and keeping your rabbit away from potentially infected rabbits can help avoid myxomatosis.</p><h2>What Is Myxomatosis? </h2><p>Myxomatosis is caused by the myxoma virus, a kind of pox virus that only affects rabbits. There are also different strains of this virus that vary in their virulence. Both wild and domesticated rabbits can get myxomatosis. Wild rabbits can survive as carriers, but the disease is usually fatal in domestic breeds (particularly those of European descent). The onset of illness is rapid after transmission, and rabbits typically die within two days of showing symptoms.</p><h2>Symptoms of Myxomatosis in Rabbits </h2><p>Rabbits that contract myxomatosis may suddenly become very ill. If a rabbit is showing symptoms, it is not uncommon for the animal to die within 48 hours.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p> </p><p>Within hours or days of contracting the myxoma virus, rabbits will show signs of feeling unwell, such as food refusal or lethargy, and their eyes will become inflamed. If a rabbit does not die within two days, as is usually the case, the illness may begin to affect the mucous membranes and other tissues, including the eyes, nose, mouth, genital and anal areas, and ears (which become droopy if they are usually standing). The rabbit's entire face may also become very swollen, and thick pus may be discharged from the nose. Due to the swelling and discharge, the rabbit will start to have difficulty breathing. Most rabbits die within 14 days of the onset of these symptoms.</p><p>In more chronic cases (depending on the virus strain and immunity of the rabbit), lumps and nodules (myxomas) may develop on the body. Rabbits with this lumpy form of myxomatosis may survive and become immune to the myxomatosis virus. This is commonly seen in wild cottontail rabbits but unfortunately seems to be a less likely course of the disease in domestic rabbits. Instead, most pet rabbits that are diagnosed with myxomatosis end up suffering from the acute forms of the disease and eventually die.</p><h2>Causes of Myxomatosis </h2><p>This pox virus is spread by blood-sucking insects but can rarely be transmitted through contact with an infected rabbit.</p><h2>Diagnosing Myxomatosis in Rabbits </h2><p>Diagnosing myxomatosis in a live rabbit is based on a veterinarian's recognition of the classic symptoms, blood and urine tests to detect the virus, and biopsies of myxomas. But, since the disease is so rapidly fatal in most cases, a diagnosis is more frequently made by a postmortem examination.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>There is, unfortunately, no specific treatment for myxomatosisso only supportive care (fluids, antibiotics to prevent secondary infections, and pain medication) can be offered by your vet. Because domestic rabbits tend to be very susceptible to the virus and suffer greatly with symptoms of the disease, euthanasia is often recommended. In some cases, however, palliative care can allow a previously young, healthy rabbit to recover.</p><h2>Prognosis for a Rabbit With Myxomatosis </h2><p>Unfortunately, the prognosis for a rabbit with myxomatosis is grim. Few domestic rabbits survive this disease.</p><h2>How to Prevent Myxomatosis </h2> <p>The myxomatosis vaccine is not available in the United States or Australia; one reason for this a concern that the virus in the vaccine might spread to the wild rabbit population. If this occurred, the wild rabbit population could develop an immunity to myxomatosis, leading to an explosion in the rabbit population. Myxomatosis was at one point deliberately introduced into the rabbit population in Australia to reduce the rabbit numbers; the outcome was an increased immunity to the disease and, in the long run, an increase in the rabbit population.</p><h2>Is Myxomatosis Contagious to Other Animals? </h2><p>Myxomatosis is contagious among rabbits, so it is important to isolate a sick rabbit from others as soon as symptoms appear. It is unusual, but possible, for the virus to spread by direct contact between rabbits as well as indirect contact (via items such as food dishes or clothes that carry the virus from rabbit to rabbit) or air transmission.</p>",711

81,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-rabbits-eat-their-poop-4582448,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Reasons Why Rabbits Eat Their Own Poop</h1>,"<h1>Reasons Why Rabbits Eat Their Own Poop</h1><p>Rabbits, much like cats, are fastidious groomers and practice very good hygiene. They are often seen licking their paws, smoothing the fur on their ears, and even cleaning their bottoms. But when cleaning their bottoms, they may also consume a special type of poop. While this may sound like quite the opposite of a good hygiene practice, there is actually a good reason why rabbits do this.</p><h2>What Is Coprophagia? </h2><p>Coprophagia occurs when feces is consumed. The mere thought of this type of behavior is rather unsettling to most people, but some animals, such as rabbits, actually eat their own feces for a very good reason. Coprophagia is a normal, healthy behavior in rabbits, but in other animals, such as dogs, it is usually discouraged due to the lack of health benefits and level of disgust by the owners.</p><h2>What Kind of Poop Do Rabbits Eat? </h2><p>Rabbits eliminate waste material on a regular basis just like other animals and humans. Fecal matter typically exits a rabbit as a round pellet but will change shape if adequate fiber and water amounts are not ingested. Fecal matter is produced throughout the day as a rabbit is hopping around or visiting the litter box, but these constantly produced fecal pellets are not what a rabbit consumes.</p><p>In addition to the regular fecal pellets that rabbits produce during the day, a special type of poop is also excreted in the night. Cecotropes, also referred to as night feces, are a specific kind of poop that is different than regular rabbit stools. Cecotropes are softer, stickier, and are usually not even seen by a rabbit owner, because a rabbit often consumes them almost as they are exiting the body. The cecotropes are produced in the cecum, a part of the intestinal tract of a rabbit, by fermentation of the food a rabbit eats. They are also only produced at night, so a rabbit will be seen eating them late at night or early in the morning. Usually the only time you will see cecotropes in your rabbit's cage or on its fur is if your rabbit is not feeling well and therefore not eating its cecotropes.</p><h2>Why Do Rabbits Eat Poop? </h2><p>Cecotropes are full of nutrients that a rabbit needs. These special feces contain more protein and vitamins than normal poops have, so by consuming its cecotropes (and a healthy diet), a rabbit is getting all of the important nutrients that it needs to stay healthy. It is completely normal behavior for rabbits to eat cecotropes at night or early in the morning, but it is not normal for them to eat their normal stools during the day.</p><h2>Signs Your Rabbit Is Eating Its Poop </h2><p>If you aren't sure if your rabbit eats its poop, there are a few key indicators you can look for.</p><p>First, check your rabbit's hind end. A rabbit normally has a clean rear end because, even though cecotropes are soft and sticky, it is consuming these poops as they are exiting the body. If there are small, soft, sticky poops stuck to your rabbit's fur, then your rabbit isn't eating its cecotropes. If there aren't any of these soft poops, then your rabbit is consuming them as it should be.</p><p>Second, check the litter box and cage floor where your rabbit sleeps. If all of the poops that are present appear round and normal, then your rabbit is probably eating its cecotropes.</p><p>Third, watch your rabbit late at night or early in the morning. If you see it cleaning its hind end and spending more time licking below its tail, then it is eating its cecotropes.</p><h2>Should You Prevent Your Rabbit From Eating Its Poop? </h2><p>No! If a rabbit does not get to eat its cecotropes, then it may be lacking some nutrients necessary for its special digestive tract to work properly. If you see your rabbit cleaning its hind end, do not disturb it.</p><h2>What if Your Rabbit Isn't Eating Its Poop? </h2><p>If your rabbit isn't eating its cecotropes, then there is most likely an underlying reason why. This could be as simple as your rabbit is too obese or arthritic to reach its cecotropes, or as serious as a digestive or other medical concern. Some rabbits that have not received appropriate nutrients from its cecotropes may benefit from transfaunation. This is when cecotropes from a healthy rabbit are fed to a sick rabbit in order to reestablish a healthy intestinal tract.</p>",739
82,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-should-you-do-if-your-hamster-has-babies-1238930,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>What Should You Do If Your Hamster Has Babies?</h1>,"<h1>What Should You Do If Your Hamster Has Babies?</h1><p>A surprise birth isn't uncommon with hamsters since they are often incorrectly sexed and purchased as adults from a pet store. While it is best to make sure you get your hamster from a store that separates males from females at a young age to avoid surprises like this, it isn't always possible.</p><p>Sometimes you'll bring a hamster home from a store where they were housed with many other hamsters, and they'll already be pregnant without you even knowing it. You may be surprised to see a litter of baby hamsters that have suddenly appeared one day in your hamster's cage and not know what to do with them.</p><h2>MakeYour Hamster Feel Comfortable </h2><p>In order to help your hamster care for its new babies, you can place strips of toilet paper or facial tissues in the cage so there is soft, clean bedding material available for the nest. Ideally, you would do this once you realize your hamster is pregnant, but it's alright if you are unaware of the pregnancy. A pregnant hamster is usually pretty noticeable a couple of days before birth just by the sheer size of its abdomen.</p><p>If you have just noticed your hamster is pregnant, do a thorough cleaning to prepare for the new arrivals. Once the babies have arrived don't worry about cleaning the cage for a while. Leave mother and babies alone for at least 7 days, especially if the mother has never given birth before. You can spot clean really wet spots if absolutely necessary, but avoid disturbing the nest, mother, and babies.</p><h2>Feeding a Pregnant Hamster </h2><p>As soon as you notice your hamster is pregnant, make sure you are offering a high-quality hamster diet with lots of protein. This diet should be continued throughout the pregnancy and until the babies are weaned. In addition to a good quality diet, you can offer small amounts of hard-boiled egg, bits of cooked chicken, cheese, and wheat germ to give the mom a nutritional boost. Make sure it always has clean water as well.</p><h2>Separate Your Hamsters </h2><p>If your pregnant hamster lives with another hamster, you may want to separate them. This will keep the babies safer and avoid any fighting between adults. It will also avoid another pregnancy in the future if you discover you have a male and a female hamster living together.</p><h2>Give Your Hamster Privacy </h2><p>It will be hard to resist, but try not to handle the babies at all for at least 7 days. You want to avoid getting your scent on the babies and unnecessarily moving them. If for some reason you must move a baby hamster, use a spoon so you do not get your scent on the baby. It is rare that you will need to move a baby though, even if they are out of the nest. The mother hamster will usually retrieve any stray pups and return them to the nest.</p><p>Make feeding and watering time as efficient and calm as possible. Keep quiet when you are in and around the cage so you don't stress your hamster out. It's okay to have a quick peek in the cage on occasion, but you should avoid sitting and watching the hamsters for long periods of time.</p><p>Keep in mind that the mother hamster will be very protective, so it may act more aggressively than usual towards you while you are in the cage. It may charge at your hand or stand on its hind legs if you get too close. This is natural and is not a cause for concern but you should still avoid getting bit and unnecessarily stressing your hamster out.</p><h2>Weaning the Baby Hamsters </h2><p>The baby hamsters will be ready to wean off of their mother at about three weeks of age. This is the best time to separate the males from the females if you have dwarf hamsters, but Syrian hamsters can stay in these male and female groups for another two to three weeks.</p><h2>Young Mother Hamsters </h2><p>Unfortunately, if you purchased a pregnant hamster from the pet store it is probably quite young and may not have the best mothering abilities. Because of this, it may be more likely to abandon or even cannibalize its babies. If you notice your hamster isn't attending to the nest or caring for the babies and they are less than 10 days old, it is unfortunately extremely difficult to save the babies.</p>",736
83,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-does-a-pet-rabbit-cost-to-care-for-1239286,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>How Much Does a Pet Rabbit Cost to Care For?</h1>,"<h1>How Much Does a Pet Rabbit Cost to Care For?</h1><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>So you are thinking about getting a pet rabbit for yourself or your child but you want to know how much it will cost. People often forget about the ongoing expense of a pet, especially one that can potentially live to be 8-10 years old (or older!).</p><h2>How Much Does a Rabbit Cost? </h2><p>Where you get your pet rabbit and what breed of rabbit you want will ultimately determine the cost. A ""normal"" breed or mix that you'd find at a pet store or rescue facility will cost less than a breed like a Jersey Wooly or Flemish Giant from a breeder. Expect to pay $20-$40 for a rabbit from a pet store, and $5-$20 for a rabbit from a rescue, fair, or 4-H club. Breeders vary in what they charge for their specific breed of rabbit. Some are cheaper than pet stores while others with rare breeds will charge closer to $100 for a rabbit. Show rabbits and breeding rabbits with champion bloodlines will, of course, cost more, just like purebred dogs and cats with champion bloodlines.</p><h2>How Much Does a Cage Cost? </h2><p>If you plan to keep your rabbit outside you'll need a rabbit hutch. If you plan to keep him in the house you'll need a nicely sized cage. Hutches typically cost more than cages but many people also make their own hutch. Expect to spend around $150-$200 on a sturdy hutch if you don't make your own.</p><p>Indoor cages vary in design quite a bit but you can expect to spend $50-$100 on a nice rabbit cage. If you are able to have a rabbit-proofed room for your bunny you can get away with a smaller cage and allow your rabbit to stretch out and run around in the safe room.</p><h2>How Much Do Rabbit Supplies Cost? </h2><p>Aside from the initial investment of the hutch or cage, your rabbit will need ongoing supplies. Bedding, food, treats, and chew toys will need to be purchased and replaced regularly. For one rabbit, I would expect to spend about $40 a month for some bedding, hay and pellets, fresh vegetables, and some treats and toys. But this number can vary greatly depending on if you buy bedding and hay in bulk, provide organic, regular, or grow your own greens, and what kind of treats and toys you buy or make.</p><h2>How Much Does Healthcare Cost for My Rabbit? </h2><p>If you plan on neutering or spaying your rabbit you can expect an initial $125-$250 worth of veterinary care. After that big expense (but well worth it to prevent other health problems and behavioral issues) you should have a regular annual exam with your exotics vet (find an exotics vet near you). Regular check-ups usually cost between $35-$65 depending on the vet. Pet insurance is available for rabbits through VPI Pet Insurance (no other company offers plans for exotics currently) for owners who are concerned about emergency costs and major illnesses like ileus, tooth issues, or other health problems as their rabbit gets older. Not all rabbits will end up with an issue but odds are there will be a problem at one time or another in your rabbit's fairly long life. The cost of caring for a sick rabbit will vary greatly on the vet and what is wrong with your rabbit but it isn't unusual to spend a couple of hundred dollars on the most common rabbit issue, ileus.</p><h2>Are There Any Other Expenses? </h2><p>Don't forget about potentially having to pay for someone to board or care for your rabbit while you are on vacation, grooming costs for nail trims, tooth trims, and fur care (if your bunny can get matted or gets fecal balls), and potential repairs from your rabbit chewing on carpeting, furniture, wires, and other household items if your home isn't rabbit proofed.</p><p>You may not have expected it to cost this much to care for a pet rabbit but it is well worth it to have a happy and healthy bunny. As with any pet, be prepared and have a plan for unexpected health problems and for the length of time you'll care for your rabbit. Expect to have your bunny for 10 years and to incur the expenses of him for the same amount of time.</p>",745
84,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-lifespan-4582447,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>How Long Do Pet Rabbits Live?</h1>,"<h1>How Long Do Pet Rabbits Live?</h1><p>Rabbits are very popular pets, and their lifespans have lengthened over the years thanks in part to the quality of care they receive from their owners. We know that many things can affect the lifespan of a pet, and rabbits are no exception.</p><h2>History of Domesticated Rabbits </h2><p>Domesticated pet rabbits are not the same as those wild cottontail rabbits you see in your yard. is the Latin name for a pet rabbit species, while wild rabbits are . This means that pet rabbits and wild rabbits are technically different species even though they are distant relatives and from the same family.</p><p>Over the years, rabbits have been used for food and fur, but since the 19th century, they have also been cared for as beloved pets. In the late 20th century, rabbits were beginning to be more commonplace in homes across America and they have grown in popularity ever since. As more people discovered the wonderful personalities of pet rabbits, the care they gave them improved and therefore lengthened the lifespan of house rabbits.</p><h2>Rabbit Breeds and Lifespan </h2><p>While the average lifespan of a pet rabbit is about 5-10 years old, certain breeds of pet rabbits are known to live longer than others. Just like dogs, miniature or dwarf breeds of rabbits tend to live longer than giant breeds. Dwarf rabbits, mini lops, and other little bunnies will typically live to be in double digits, while large breeds, like French lops and Flemish giants, won't.</p><h2>Rabbit Nutrition and Lifespan </h2><p>A rabbit, just like any other animal, has specific nutritional requirements and we know that what we feed our pet rabbits has a direct effect on their lifespan. Nutrition goes hand in hand with the overall health of a rabbit and if it isn't getting the appropriate vitamins, minerals, fiber content, and other ingredients in its diet, it isn't going to be healthy and therefore it will not live as long.</p><p>Special pelleted diets for rabbits, hay, and vegetables should make up the diet for a pet rabbit. Some treats and fruits can be given in moderation but if an unbalanced diet is fed, it will result in an unhealthy rabbit. Some people will only feed their rabbits pellets from the pet store, but this may be lacking in vitamins and minerals that a rabbit needs.</p><h2>Rabbit Health and Lifespan </h2><p>In addition to the food you feed, many things play a role in the health of your rabbit. Rabbits can develop illnesses or get parasites, and if left untreated, these health concerns may shorten your rabbit's life. Practicing good hygiene by washing your hands before and after handling your rabbit, as well as regular cage cleaning, are good ways to keep your rabbit healthy. Regular check-ups with your veterinarian will also help catch any problems that your rabbit may be developing before its too late to do anything about it.</p><p>Spaying or neutering your rabbit can also help lengthen its lifespan. Female rabbits are prone to mammary and uterine cancers and male rabbits can develop testicular cancer. By getting a rabbit spayed or neutered, you will drastically decrease the likelihood of your rabbit developing cancer and therefore increase its odds of living a long life.</p><h2>Rabbit Lifestyle and Lifespan </h2><p>Rabbits need a lot of space and mental stimulation, but unfortunately, many people think they are happy being kept in a cage their entire lives. Rabbits, while able to live indoors or outdoors, need large areas, such as a bedroom, to call their own, as well as toys, things to chew on, and items to play on. Rabbits that don't get the proper space and enrichment aren't usually as healthy as those that do and therefore may not have as long of a lifespan as they should.</p><p>It is also important to provide a calm home for your rabbit. Extreme amounts of stress can cause your rabbit to die. Being taunted by a cat or dog, grabbed by a child, or being hurt can result in your rabbit going into shock and dying.</p><h2>Oldest Rabbit on Record </h2><p>According to Guinness World Records, the oldest rabbit to ever live was a wild-born rabbit named Flopsy, who was slightly more than 18 years old when he passed. Flopsy was caught in Australia in 1964 and lived with his owner, L.B. Walker, in Longford, Tasmania. Most rabbits don't make it into double digits, so to have a teenage rabbit is quite the achievement as a pet owner.</p>",738

But they are also very popular pets in homes around the world. They have unique and specific dietary requirements but can be a lot of fun to care for--if you can understand their behavior.</p><h2>Sugar Gliders in the Wild </h2><p>Wild gliders live in groups of up to seven adults (plus any babies that have been born recently) and are highly social. They live in trees, practice social grooming (which does more than just keep each other clean), and protect their territory that can include over two acres of land and trees. The dominant male marks the rest of his group with his saliva and by using his scent glands (on his chest and forehead) and can recognize the members of his colony with thatunique smell.</p><h2>Understanding Captive Sugar Gliders </h2><p>Once you understand what a normal, wild sugar glider does (and why he does it) you can better appreciate what your pet sugar glider does in captivity. If you have a lone glider as a pet you may need to understand that your glider craves companionship and if you are unable to be his social companion and commit tohim the bulk of your day then he may be stressed. If you have an intact male you may experience more territorial behavior if he is not neutered because his instincts tell him if things don't smell like him they are a threat to his territory or colony. Overall, captive gliders aren't typically kept as wild gliders so we must either adapt our care to create a more natural environment for them or at the very least, understand that some of their behaviors are normal for the species (e.g., being nocturnal, scent-marking, crabbing when scared, etc.).</p><h2>Normal Sugar Glider Behavior</h2><p>Sugar gliders are very social and can be extremely friendly to humans if handled regularly (especially as a young joey). Normal sugar glider behavior is that gliders will bond with you if they are kept alone and you create enough time to spend with your glider daily or they will bond with their sugar glider mate if you allow them to have a friend (or friends).</p><p>Crabbing is normal sound gliders make when they are scared, upset, or threatened. It is often heard when you wake a sleeping glider, if you disrupt it, try to pick up a scared glider, or when you take your sugar glider to see his vet if he isn't used to those surroundings.</p><p>Scent marking is normal for males to do to their belongings and their social group or mate. Your glider may mark you by rubbing on you or even dribbling some urine on you. This smell and behavior can be limited by having your male neutered.</p><p>Sugar gliders are nocturnal so they typically will not be active during the day. This doesn't mean you can't bond with your glider while you are awake and he is sleeping but it does mean that he may get a little crabby if you try to wake him up to play with him. Most glider owners have a cloth or fleece pouch they wear around their neck and under their shirt during the day. This keeps their gliders close to them so your scent will stay familiar with your pet sugar glider. This is especially important to do with joys and new gliders who are not familiar with you and have not bonded with you yet.</p><p>Sugar gliders typically enjoy their food in the evening since they usually sleep during the day. This may mean you can't share your mealtimes with your pet and you need to make sure their meals are fresh when you go to bed, not when you are eating breakfast.</p><p>Sugar gliders are arboreal so they like to climb and jump from place to place. They don't want to run around on the ground. They feel safe up high so they may immediately crawl up your arm, hide at the nape of your neck, or perch on the top of your head (hopefully they don't decide to urine mark you here). Make sure you encourage this normal behavior for both their physical and mental health but only allow it in safe environments.</p><p>By offering a natural, safe, environment, appropriate diet, and regular enrichment, attention, and mental stimulation, your sugar glider can be a great addition to your family--you just need to take the time to understand each other.</p>",746
86,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-rabbit-housing-1237192,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Pet Rabbit Housing Giude</h1>,"<h1>Pet Rabbit Housing Giude</h1><p>Pet rabbits can be quite readily kept in cages in the home, with some freedom to run free in the house after thoroughly rabbit-proofing, of course. Rabbits take fairly well to litter training, so many people will let their bunnies run free in the home for at least part of the day. Even if your rabbit is thoroughly toilet trained and your house thoroughly rabbit proofed, a cage will act as a safe haven or nest, where the rabbit can retreat to rest.</p><p>However, there are a lot of cages sold for rabbits that aren't really ideal rabbit homes. Some are just too small, and many have wire floors, which may make cleaning easier but doesn't provide much comfort to the bunny.</p><h2>How Big </h2><p>As usual, bigger is better. If your bunny will spend most of its time in a cage, then get the biggest cage that is practical in the home. As a general rule, the cage should be at least four times the size of the rabbit. A guide is 24"" by 36"" for smaller rabbits (less than 8 lbs.) or 30"" by 36"" for larger rabbits. A two-story condo with a ramp joining the levels seems popular with rabbits too.</p><h2>Cage Design </h2><p>As a rule, rabbits take fairly well to being litter trained, so a solid floor is fine and not too difficult to clean. Many cages meant for rabbits are still made with wire floors positioned over pull out pans, designed to make cleaning easier. However, wire floors (even those with very narrow spacing) can be uncomfortable for your rabbit to walk on and can cause sores on its hocks, so it is best to get a cage without wire floors. If your cage does have wire floors, the wire should be covered with a piece of wood, or grass or sisal mats. grass mats are nice to have in solid floored cages too, to vary the surface and provide traction.</p><p>The door to the cage should be about large enough to get a litter pan and your rabbit through easily. A side door is probably best, as a top-opening cage makes getting the rabbit in and out a little harder and it is best if the rabbit can get in and out on its own. The opening should have smooth edges or plastic guard strips over the edges of the wires. </p><p>If you are handy, you can get fairly creative and construct your own cage. This allows a custom size to be designed.</p><h2>Bedding/Litter </h2><p>Grass/sisal mats are a good idea for solid floored cages, too, to provide traction. Fleece blankets can also be provided. Pieces of carpet or towels also make nice mats, as long as your rabbit is not unraveling and eating them.</p><p>As for other pets, cedar and pine shavings should be avoided due to concerns over the aromatic oils they release. These oils have been shown to elevate the levels of some liver enzymes, which can affect the metabolism of drugs and other compounds. If wood shavings are used at all, better alternatives include hardwood shavings such as aspen. Straw or hay is a good bedding material for rabbits. For choices for the litter box, see the section on litter training.</p><h2>Outdoors/Hutches </h2><p>Living alone in an outdoor hutch is a lonely existence for a rabbit; however, a house rabbit that is allowed time outdoors will likely enjoy the change of scenery and fresh air. Keep in mind that there are several dangers in the outdoors, including predators, weather, and toxicity from herbicides, pesticides, or poisonous plants. Since predators present the largest danger at night, keeping a rabbit outdoors in a hutch at night is risky, even in a city (city-dwelling predators may include raccoons, cats, dogs, coyotes, hawks and more). Many animals can injure or kill a rabbit without even getting into the cage. If a rabbit is to stay outside, it should at least be in an enclosed shed, garage, or some shelter that allows complete protection.</p><p>Many owners allow their rabbits outside in an enclosed pen made form a wood frame with wire on all sides (including top and bottom). This allows bunnies to spend time outside and munch on the grass (provided it is not treated with any herbicides, pesticides, or other chemicals!) without burrowing out, and with protection from unwanted visitors. Shelter from sun, wind, rain, and other elements must also be provided.</p>",739
87,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guinea-pig-lice-1238205,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>Guinea Pig Lice</h1>,"<h1>Guinea Pig Lice</h1><p>If your pet guinea pig is itching and scratching, it may have a common ectoparasite called lice. Guinea pig lice can be prevented, treated, and eliminated safely if you know what to do.</p><h2>Does YourGuinea Pig Have Lice? </h2><p>If you suspect your guinea pig has a lice infestation, also called pediculosis, you should seek medical attention from your exotic pet veterinarian immediately. Your vet can diagnose your guinea pig with lice and treat it safely and appropriately. Do not attempt to buy over-the-counter medication from a drug store or pet store to treat rodent lice. Human lice treatments are far too strong for a small rodent and pet store treatments can be dangerous in their own right, causing seizures or simply not work. It's much safer to have your vet use a medication that is dosed appropriately and documented for use in a guinea pig.</p><h2>After Treating Your Guinea Pig </h2><p>After your pet has received effective treatment and before returning it to the cage, thoroughly clean and wash the cage, dishes, and any of its toys with water and some mild dish detergent. Be sure to rinse all the soap off before putting fresh bedding in. Throw out any old bedding and food that could have been previously infected with lice, and freeze any remaining materials to kill any remaining lice that may be hiding out in it.</p><h2>Can YouGet Lice From Your Guinea Pig? </h2><p>Lice are species-specific so no, you cannot get lice from your pet guinea pig. This means that humans get human lice, mice get mouse lice, guinea pigs get guinea pig lice, and so on. You don't need to worry about you or your child getting lice from your pet guinea pig or any other pet for that matter. If a louse jumps on you, it won't bite you and it cannot survive from living off your scalp.</p><h2>Difference Between Mites and Lice </h2><p>Mites are arachnids like spiders and ticks, and lice are insects like ants. There are also two kinds of lice: sucking lice and biting or chewing lice. The sucking lice are more worrisome than the chewing lice because of the possibility of blood-borne disease transmission and excessive blood loss in your guinea pig if they have a heavy infestation. Both mites and lice are very uncomfortable and can even be painful to your guinea pig though so you'll want to prevent them, or get rid of them, as soon as possible.</p><h2>Preventing YourGuinea Pig From Getting Lice </h2><p>Guinea pigs that don't regularly visit other guinea pigs live in a very isolated environment, therefore there are typically two ways in which your guinea pig can get lice. Prepackaged food and bedding materials, even if they are not made of natural materials, can harbor lice and be brought into your house from pet stores. The best way to prevent bringing lice into your guinea pig's homeis to freeze its food and bedding for 24 hours before putting it into its cage or the room where the cage is. Freezing the products will kill any lice or mites that were brought in from the store or warehouse. If your guinea pig is never exposed to lice, it will never get it.</p><p>Guinea pigs that visit other guinea pigs or go to areas that have other guinea pigs such as rescue facilities and shelters, show rings, pet stores, or even to a friend's house are more susceptible to picking up lice. After a visit to somewhere with guinea pigs, check behind your guinea pig's ears to see if you see any small eggs, called nits, or tiny lice crawling around. These areas are absent of fur so it makes it easiest to see any parasites here but lice may be present anywhere on your guinea pig if they have them.</p><p>If you handle guinea pigs that are not your own, make sure you wash your hands between handling them and your own guinea pigs. This will help prevent you from bringing lice to your guinea pig.</p><p>Regular cage cleanings are another way to help prevent lice infestations or at least cut down on the severity of them. If lice are somehow in the enclosure, regular cleanings will help decrease the chance of the lice finding their way to your guinea pig.</p><p>Pyrethrin/Pyrethroid Poisoning in Dogs.</p><p>Common Mites of Your Rabbits and Small Animal: Cavy Lice.</p><p>Lice: What they are and how to control them.</p>",729

There are a variety of diseases and issues, such as infections and tumors, that can affect the health of your guinea pig's eyes, but some of these problems are seen more commonly than others. By familiarizing yourself with some of the possibilities, you'll be better prepared to deal with an eye problem that your guinea pig may have in the future.</p><h2>What Are Eye Problems in Guinea Pigs? </h2><p>Eye infections or problems refer to a variety of issues that impact a guinea pig's eyes. The symptoms all range depending on the type of problem. Once diagnosed, treatments will vary greatly.</p><h2>Symptoms of Eye Problems in Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Depending on the symptom, some at-home remedies can work. If you notice any eye issues, it's best to schedule an appointment with your veterinarian. Eye issues can be serious and if left untreated, they could result in blindness.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p> </p><h3>Cloudiness or Redness </h3><p>You may see a bit of cloudiness or redness in the eye if your guinea pig has a corneal ulcer. A corneal ulcer is a defect in the layer of your pet's eyes known as the cornea.</p><h3>Frequent Pawing, Scratching, or Closed Eye </h3><p>If your guinea pig is pawing at its eye, keeping it closed, or even rubbing it on the ground, it is signaling that it has a problem. The pain from the ulcer may cause your guinea pig to stop eating and then even develop ileus.</p><h3>Inflammation/Discharge </h3><p>Your guinea pig may have an infection if there is hair loss around the infected eye. It may also have an infection if there is redness called conjunctivitis, discharge, inflammation, or swelling. Your pet may even hold the infected eye shut if it's infected.</p><h3>Constant Tearing </h3><p>Normal ducts flow through the nose and allow drainage from the eyes. But if that duct is blocked or clogged, excessive drainage will occur from the eye.</p><h3>Large Bulges/Masses </h3><p>Tumors and growths can cause your guinea pig's eye to bulge or swell. </p><h2>Causes of Eye Problems in Guinea Pigs </h2><p>The cause of a guinea pig's eye problems could range from a scratched cornea, corneal ulcer, infection, or even more serious tumors.</p><h3>Corneal Ulcers </h3><p> Sometimes eyes get scratched or irritated by something in your guinea pig's cage such as hay or bedding,or even after a struggle with another guinea pig. These scratches or irritations can cause an injury called a corneal ulcer.</p><h3>Eye Infections </h3><p>Irritation or exposure to excessive amounts of bacteria or fungal spores can cause your guinea pig's eyes to become infected. If your guinea pig has a lot of discharge from the eye and it is crusting shut, you can use a warm, damp cloth to gently clean it until you can see your vet.</p><h3>Overgrown Teeth </h3><p>Guinea pigs have teeth similar to those of a rabbit. Their front teeth are called incisors. The roots of these incisors can grow into a pathway between the nose and the eyes, called the nasal-lacrimal duct, and cause your guinea pig's eyes to weep.</p><h3>Tumors </h3><p>Sometimes growths or tumors will, unfortunately, develop behind the eyes of guinea pigs. These growths will likely be very uncomfortable for your guinea pig. </p><h2>Diagnosing Eye Problems in Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Eye issues in guinea pigs can be hard to diagnose. Each cause of an eye problem in a guinea pig requires a different test for an accurate diagnosis.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The cause of the issue determines the course of treatment for eye problems in a guinea pig. </p><h2>Prognosis for Guinea Pigs With Eye Problems </h2><p>Most eye problems can be cleared up in guinea pigs and go on to live normal lives. However, guinea pigs that are suspected to have tumors behind their eyes are often treated symptomatically and provided with hospice care.</p><h2>How to Prevent Eye Problems </h2><p>Some of the common eye issues in guinea pigs are somewhat preventable and others are not.</p>",684
89,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-do-tarantulas-mate-5217504,Small Pets > Exotic Pets,<h1>How Do Tarantulas Mate?</h1>,"<h1>How Do Tarantulas Mate?</h1><p>There are around 850 different species of tarantulas, and several of them have found their way into the hearts and homes of pet owners. After falling in love with one tarantula, spider owners may decide that they want more than one pet spider and decide to breed them. Knowing more about how pet tarantulas mate can help a tarantula owner provide the best possible care to their current and future spider family.</p><h2>Can You House Tarantulas Together to Mate? </h2><p>It is not recommended to house a male and female tarantula together because they are normally cannibalistic. When both tarantulas are sexually mature, you can place the male in a small enclosure inside the female's enclosure for a few days or a week. This will allow the tarantulas to see and smell each other without causing harm to one another. During this time, the female should create a burrow and be fed so that she is not hungry when she meets the male. The tarantulas should only be allowed together if the female is receptive to the male and then once the mating occurs, the male should be removed from the enclosure before the female becomes aggressive towards him.</p><p>A paint stick is a good tool to have to break up a fight or assist in removing the male from the female's enclosure. If your tarantulas are not interested in mating, do not attempt to force it or continue to house them together. Tarantulas should be housed by themselves. </p><h2>When Is a Tarantula Ready to Mate? </h2><p>When a male tarantula is sexually mature, they are able to produce semen and breed with a sexually mature female. The age of sexual maturity in a tarantula will vary between species but may not occur until they are several years of age. Once a male tarantula reaches maturity, they also don't usually live for more than a year or so. This means that the amount of time you have to breed your male tarantula is limited.</p><h2>Reproductive Habits of Tarantulas </h2><p>Mating usuallly occurs once a year, but how a tarantula mates is probably not what you would expect. Once a male tarantula is mature and wanting to mate, he will rub his abdomen onto a web mat that he wove. This rubbing will excrete semen which the male will then rub onto his pedipalps, i.e. fangs, into a little packet. The pedipalps keep the semen viable in the little packet until he can find a female to mate with. When a suitable female is found, the semen packet from the pedipalps is inserted into an opening called the opisthosoma in the female's abdomen. The male will then quickly leave before the female is no longer welcoming of his presence for mating purposes.</p><h2>Laying Eggs </h2><p>Depending on the species of tarantula, eggs will be fertilized and laid several weeks or months after this mating occurs. These eggs will be laid inside an egg sac that will be produced by the female tarantula. This egg sac will then be carefully cared for and rotated by the female tarantula in her burrow until the babies emerge from the sac. Aggression is typical from the female tarantula while she is protecting this egg sac.</p><p>Some tarantula breeders opt to take the eggs away from the mother spider when the egg sac is produced to prevent her from eating her young when they hatch and to make it easier to separate them as they grow. These eggs would then need to be kept warm in another enclosure, but you can also attempt to keep them with the mother spider until they go through their first molt. </p><h2>How Many Babies Do Tarantulas Have? </h2><p>The number of eggs that a tarantula will lay varies between species but around 100 eggs is a good amount to expect from most pet tarantulas. Some species only lay around 50 eggs while others lay over 1,000 eggs, so breeding tarantulas is not a hobby for someone who simply wants one or two more spiders to care for.</p><p>In the case of the Mexican Red-Knee tarantula, fertilized eggs hatch inside the egg sac after about three months and then around 200-400 babies may appear from the sac after another three weeks. These spiderlings will go through several molts during their first year of life and the number that survive to adulthood will depend on how well you care for them. </p>",729
90,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-do-ferrets-like-tubes-5184099,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Why Ferrets Like Tubes</h1>,"<h1>Why Ferrets Like Tubes</h1><p>Some ferrets are simply obsessed with tubes and spend most of their time running through them. This is not a problematic behavior but knowing why your ferret frequents these play tunnels can help you better understand your pet. It can also encourage you to continue to provide it with physical and mental stimulation.</p><h2>Why Do Ferrets Like Tubes? </h2><p>Ferrets are domesticated relatives of the European polecat and members of the weasel family. Black-footed ferrets and minks are also closely related. This group of animals naturally use burrows in the ground as their dens. It is in these dens that they sleep, have their young, store their food, and eat. Ferrets may be a step away genetically from their cousins the European polecat, black-footed ferret, and mink, but the instinct to spend time in a den-like structure has not left them.</p><p>Black-footed ferrets exclusively use the burrows of prairie dogs as their homes. They don't dig the burrows out themselves but they will eat the prairie dogs and then live in their underground homes. Minks may dig a burrow out or use an old hollowed-out log as a den, still enjoying being in a cozy, tunnel or cave-like house. European polecats may utilize multiple dens in the wild or take over an abandoned badger or fox burrow.</p><p>This is why ferrets like tubes so much. It is a natural, normal behavior for a ferret to want to play or sleep in tubes since they are similar to dens and burrows. Ferrets also like to run around, chase other ferrets, and hide in these tubes. They like the close quarters the tubes provide and may even hide their toys and food in their tubes.</p><h2>Why You Should Get a Tube for Your Ferret </h2><p>If you don't have a tube or play tunnel for your ferret, you are missing out on the opportunity to provide your pet with some wonderful enrichment. Tubes are also not only fun for your ferret but are very entertaining for you to watch your ferret play in. Any time you can mimic a more natural environment or provide mentally stimulating activities for a pet, you should. Your ferret will be happier, be provided with something to keep it from getting bored, and have an opportunity to exercise.</p><p>If you don't have tubes for your ferrets, your ferret may try to dig in its litter box, blankets, carpeting, furniture, and other things in an attempt to create a den. This can lead to unnecessary destruction, mess, and frustration. Tubes can help prevent a ferret from causing extra trouble and act as pseudo-burrows and dens to fulfill the need to hide.</p><h2>Different Types of Tubes for Ferrets </h2><p>A few different kinds of tubes are available to purchase for pet ferrets. Hard plastic tubes and flexible slinky-like tubes are regularly seen in pet stores but many ferret owners also purchase items that aren't necessarily designed for ferrets to make their own homemade ferret tubes.</p><p>Hard tubes can be added to ferret cages that are designed to have tubes connecting one level to the next, much like a large hamster cage. Flexible tubes are for use outside of the cage. You can also often create several feet of flexible tubing outside the cage by connecting multiple sets of tubes together. Hard tubing that separates in half is easier to clean than flexible tubing, but flexible tubing is more versatile, especially if you don't have a cage specifically designed to fit the hard tubing. The little bit of work it takes to clean the tubing is worth the hours of enjoyment it will bring your ferrets.</p><h2>Homemade Tubes for Ferrets </h2><p>If you opt to make your own tubes for your ferrets to play in, choose tubing material that can be washed. Make sure the tube diameter is large enough to fit your ferret and that there are no sharp edges that could injure it when it's running and playing. Ensure the material that the tube is made of isn't easily torn or dangerous if your ferret were to chew on it. Dryer and other air duct vent tubing, children's play tubes, pond tubing, and more can be used as ferret tubes but some are easier to clean than others. Simply placing these tubes on the floor in your ferret-proofed room will provide hours of fun and exercise for your ferret and enjoyment for you as you watch it play.</p>",731
91,https://www.thesprucepets.com/sugar-glider-pouches-4008218,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Sugar Glider Pouches</h1>,"<h1>Sugar Glider Pouches</h1><p>Sugar gliders are interesting animals for many reasons, but one of these reasons is shared by only a few animals in the world: the pouch. The pouch has one primary purpose for all marsupials, but as pet owners, we need to be aware of other things that may involve your sugar glider's pouch besides a joey.</p><h2>Sugar Glider Pouch Purpose </h2><p>Only female sugar gliders have a pouch (called a marsupium) and its main purpose is to protect, raise, and carry young (called joeys). This pouch is located on the abdomen (belly) of your female sugar glider, and the opening of it is about where the belly button would be on other mammals. The pouch doesn't have an opening like a pocket on your t-shirt but rather opens by expanding or stretching the circular entry, creating a very secure area where a joey won't fall out and can stay warm while it is growing.</p><p>The joey is not born in the pouch, despite what many people think, but does crawl into it immediately after it is birthed like all other mammals. Inside the pouch the naked, pink, blind, joey can keep warm, grow, develop, and feed off of one of the four teats located inside the pouch. As the joey grows it will start to explore outside of the pouch but will continue to nurse on the teats that are located inside the pouch for at least eight weeks. These four teats are unique because they can offer milk for four different life stages all at the same time enabling the mother sugar glider to care for young of different ages.</p><h2>Sugar Glider Pouch Problems </h2><p>Female sugar gliders can also develop problems with their pouch in addition to using it to care for their young. The most common problems are pouch infections and mastitis of the teats inside the pouch. Symptoms of both problems are very similar and you may notice a smelly discharge coming from the pouch (it should normally be dry and have no odor) if your sugar glider has one or both issues.</p><p>Pouch infections can be a yeast or bacterial issue and may need to be cultured by your exotics vet in order to choose the right medication to successfully treat the issue. Nursing joeys may avoid the pouch and stop nursing even if the teats are not affected due to the infection of the pouch. Weight loss, dehydration and even sepsis are usually seen in nursing joeys who have mothers with a pouch infection or mastitis.</p><p>Mastitis usually makes the teats red, swollen, firm, painful, and prevents milk from flowing normally. The teats cannot be seen without ""unfolding"" the pouch. This may need to be done on a sedated or anesthetized sugar glider by your exotics vet if they are painful. Joeys will lose weight and dehydrate since milk is not being supplied to them by the infected teats. The discharge from the teats may need to be collected in order to culture it and determine which antibiotics or antifungal medication will be successful but still safe to treat your sick sugar glider.</p><p>Joeys that are still nursing on a mother that has mastitis and/or a pouch infection will need to be hand fed and possibly put on the same medications as the mother. Regular gentle swabbing with cotton swabs in the pouch with a disinfecting chlorhexidine solution may also need to be done to cleanse the area. Your sugar glider may also require pain medication.</p><p>A less commonly seen pouch problem is prolapse. Pouch prolapse (or inversion) is when the pouch is inside out and the pink, fleshy lining of the pouch is visible on the outside. It might occur with over grooming when your sugar glider pulls her pouch open too far to clean herself, or in females who have recently weaned a joey. Normally the pouch prolapse will correct itself, but in the off chance that it doesn't, you should contact your exotics vet.</p><h2>How Do You Prevent Pouch Problems in Sugar Gliders? </h2><p>Cleanliness in the environment and sugar gliders in the cage are crucial to preventing pouch infections and mastitis in female sugar gliders. If your sugar glider has had a pouch problem before, you may need to clean the cage or nest more often and bathe them or their cage mates that interact with them using a damp wash cloth on a regular basis.</p><p>Diseases and Syndromes of Sugar Gliders.</p>",732

But while they may look similar to fluffy, little, black and white kittens it doesn't mean that they'll behave like or are simply striped cats. Wild baby skunks are still wild animals and just because someone brings one into their home doesn't automatically make it safe, tame, or legal, even if it is an orphan.</p><h2>State Lawson Pet Skunks</h2><p>The first reason why keeping a wild baby skunk as a pet is a bad idea is that it is most likely illegal to do so where you live. Most states prohibit you from taking an animal from the wild and keeping it as a pet and there are good reasons for this. If everyone went out in search of baby skunks and kept the ones they found, the wild skunk population would eventually be depleted and then a varietyof other environmental issues would arise from the lack of wild skunks.</p><p>Some people are specially licensed to care for, rehabilitate, and sometimes even house wild skunks for the rest of the skunk's life, but these wild skunks still aren't pets to these people. Licensed rehabilitators have completed the necessary steps to have and continue to have their permits and licenses to care for wild animals. They know what skunks need and are able to rehabilitate them and release them into the wild if they are healthy. They also know how to avoid imprinting baby skunks and to give them the best chance at survival in the wild, something the general public does not typically know how to do. If you find a wild, orphaned or injured baby skunk, check with your state division of natural resources to find a skunk rehabilitator near you.</p><p>If you are considering keeping a wild skunk as a pet, be sure to check your state laws to see if it is legal to own onewhere you live. If your state allows skunks to be kept as pets but requires a permit to do so, you will most likely need to show proof of purchase, such as a receipt, from someone with a wildlife propagation permit who breeds skunks to obtain one.</p><h2>Skunks and Rabies</h2><p>Skunks are a rabies vector species which means they can have, get, or contract rabies to humans since rabies is a zoonotic disease. Rabies is still a very real problem and depending on where you live, it is often seenin wild skunks according to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>All it takes to contract the deadly virusis one little bite from an adult or baby skunk. You'll regret ever bringing the animal into your house especially since only a handful of unvaccinated people have ever survived having rabies.</p><h2>Veterinary Care for Wild Skunks </h2><p>It is hard to find a vet that will treat exotic or non-traditional speciesto begin with butit is nearly impossible to find a vet that is willing to work on an illegally owned, potentially harboring rabies, wild skunk. So even if you decide to keep your new little white striped friend as a pet, you will be hard-pressed to find a vet that will descent it for you or provide medical care when necessary. There are only a couple of veterinarians in the entire country that are willing to provide this type of care and they often require proof of legal ownership or permits. Even if you decide to keep a wildskunk without getting it descented, spayed, or neutered, you must ask yourself what you will do when the skunk needs medical attention.</p><h2>What If a Baby Skunk Is an Orphan? </h2><p>Ifyou know without a doubt that a baby skunk is an orphan (the mother was hit by a car, etc.) it is natural to want to try and help it. The thought of just letting nature take its course is tough and most people will try to intercede. This is, of course, okay but you need to get that skunk to someone who knows how to care for a baby wild skunk, is rabies vaccinated, and can give the skunk the best chance for reintroduction into the wild when it is old enough. You can do this by calling your local nature center, wildlife center, the state division of natural resources fish and wildlife division, or even your local vet to see if they have resources for you to take the skunk to an appropriate place.</p>",732

It can be a bit tricky to handle pet mice as they're small and quick, but once they're tamed, they can be picked up, handled, and can make great pets, (even for kids).</p><p>It's easiest to tame a mouse that's relaxed and comfortable in its surroundings. Starting with young mice will make the tamingprocess much easier. Use lots of treats and work slowly.Make sure your mouse is comfortable with each step before proceeding to the next.</p><h2>Building Trust </h2><p>Taming a mouse is really the same thing as gaining its trust. Your mouse must believe that it is safe with you, despite your enormous size. Throughout the training process, try to avoid doing anything that will stress your pet mouse.</p><p>You'll need to do routine things like cleaning the cage,but keep in mind that moving slowly and gently throughout these necessary chores will help in the process of gaining your mouse's trust. Until your mouse is tamed, there is a chance that it will bite. Mice can bite hard. If they bite,it is because they are scared. If your mouse does nip you, don't shake your hand to get it off, or get angry, as this will just make matters worse. If your mouse bites, back off and do more to gain its trust.</p><h3>Tips for Taking Care of a Pet Mouse</h3><h2>Important Information About Keeping Pet Mice </h2><p>It is best not to allow pet mice to run around outside their cage unless they are tame. The stress of chasing, catching, and returning them to their cage may scare them and make them fear their owners. If you allow your pet mouse time outside of the cage, make sure the area is very well mouse-proofed as mice can get through very small cracks.</p><p>Mice can usually be kept in small groups of females (since you will get baby mice from housing males and females together) but males usually do best alone, otherwise they will fight with each other. Female mice usually bond well with each other and this should not affect the taming process. In fact, a single mouse is more likely to be stressed and nervous and therefore may be more difficult to tame than a female mouse that has other female mouse roommates.</p><h2>Start Slowly </h2><p>When your mouse (or mice) arrive, they'll need time to adjust to their new surroundings and begin to trust you. This can be hard for young children who want to play with their new pets right away, but its worth a few days of frustration as patience can lead to wonderful results.</p><h2>Teach Your Mouse to Trust You </h2><p>After a few days, your mouse should be able to stay calm when you come into the room and sit down next to its cage.</p><h2>Pick Up Your Mouse the Right Way </h2><p>Now that your mouse is climbing onto your hand and allowing you to scratch it, you can start to take your mouse out to play. Mouse owners and young children, in particular, are eager to pick up and hold their pet mouse. While holding a mouse isn't a problem, there are some things to remember as you begin to tame and handle your pet mouse.</p><h3>Tips</h3><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Mice are naturally timid animals, and small noises or motion can frighten them. They are also very small and quick, and can easily hide inaccessible places. To keep your mouse safe outside the cage, you'll want to create a play area from which your mouse can't escape. You can do that by, for example, building up a circle of pillows, playing with your mouse in a small space like a bathroom, or purchasing a solid-sided puppy corral.</p><p>Once you know your mouse is safe, you can start to ""proof"" its friendly behavior by gently challenging it with unexpected sounds and new people.</p><p>You may have to go through a process of teaching your mouse to trust young children, as they are often louder and faster than adults or teens.</p>",694
94,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-chinchillas-1238544,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Food Options for Your Pet Chinchilla</h1>,"<h1>Food Options for Your Pet Chinchilla</h1><p>Chinchillas have very sensitive digestive systems, so feeding a good quality diet appropriate for chinchillas is essential to their health. In the wild, chinchillas are naturally adapted to eating a diet of vegetation that is high in roughage. They are not designed for rich or fatty diets and such diets can easily cause serious digestive upsets. Instead, feed your chinchilla quality chinchilla pellets supplemented with plenty of fresh grass hay.</p><h2>Food Options </h2><p>Pelleted diets are better than a mixture of loose items. Loose mixes may be nutritionally balanced while in the bag but only if your chinchilla eats all of the parts of the mix.</p><p>Look for a pelleted, formulated diet specifically for chinchillas that is 16-20 percent protein, low in fat (2-4 percent), and high in fiber (15-20 percent). If it is impossible for you to get a good quality chinchilla diet, many experts suggest substituting a good rabbit or guinea pig pellet with similar characteristics but this should only be done temporarily and in emergency situations. Online stores should be utilized if your local pet store does not carry a quality chinchilla formula. Chinchillas have specific dietary requirements that are different than other rodents and their health will suffer if they are not fed quality, chinchilla-specific food.</p><p>If you choose to feed a loose item mixture (with pellets, seeds, corn, etc.), keep in mind that there is a concern that feeding corn can cause digestive upset and bloating due to high starch content, and manychinchilla foodscontain corn as an ingredient. Since corn is starchy and likely largely indigestible for chinchillas, whole corn should be avoided as a treat or the main part of a diet. Scientifically speaking, however, little is understood about the ideal chinchilla diet beyond the need for lots of roughage.</p><h2>Feeding Amounts </h2><p>Most chinchillas will eat one to two tablespoons of pellets a day. While they are not prone to overeating, for freshness it is a good idea to feed a small number of pellets at a time. Feeding a tablespoon in the morning and again in the evening seems to work well, but can be adjusted as needed. Some people just feed a couple of tablespoons in the evening as chinchillas tend to eat at this time in the wilderness.</p><p>Try to be consistent with whatever you choose to do, as chinchillas like routine. A small food hopper or heavy ceramic dish is the best way to keep the food from getting dumped or soiled.</p><h2>Hay Supplementation </h2><p>Even when you choose a high fiber pelleted diet, it must still be supplemented with hay to ensure your chinchilla gets plenty of roughage (fiber). This roughage in hay helps keep chinchillas' teeth in good condition and the digestive system functioning properly. Feed as much good quality grass hay (orchard grass, Timothy-grass, etc.) as your chinchilla wants each day. Hay should be cleaned out and fed fresh on a daily basis to keep it from becoming soiled or moldy. Pressed cubes of hay can be given, but it is recommended to still feed loose hay, as it has long strand fiber.</p><p>Alfalfa hay should not be fed exclusively to most adult chinchillas. Alfalfa is high in protein, calcium, and oxalates which means that too much could possibly lead to urinary and other problems. Don't feed any hay that is damp, smells musty, or is discolored regardless of what kind it is.</p><h2>Treats </h2><p>Chinchillas should be given very little in the way of treats never more than a teaspoon a day. Raisins and dried fruit are favorites but are also high in sugar so they should be fed in very small quantities and infrequently. Try not to feed more than 3 or 4 raisins per week. Rose hips are another recommended treat as they are high in vitamin C and other nutrients. Most commercial treats for chinchillas will be too high in sugar and fat that aren't hay-based. Check with your vet if you are unsure about anything you are feeding your chinchilla.</p><p>Though we don't normally think of twigs and branches as anything special, your chinchilla will likely view them as a terrific treat. Twigs from apple trees and other safe trees can be given to your chinchilla.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Make sure any wood you use has not been treated with pesticidesand do not offer branches from toxic trees, including trees that have fruit with pits or stones, evergreen wood, and others.</p>",727
95,https://www.thesprucepets.com/circling-in-hamsters-5095738,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Circling in Hamsters</h1>,"<h1>Circling in Hamsters</h1><p>Hamsters are very active so it is normal to see them running around their cages and on their exercise wheels. But if your hamster suddenly begins circling and tilting its head to one side while it is running around then this indicates it has a problem. Veterinary care may be necessary if your hamster is circling so being able to recognize this issue is important for keeping it healthy.</p><h2>Causes of Circling in Hamsters </h2><p>Circling in hamsters occurs when a hamster has a head tilt. Head tilts are usually a result of an inner ear infection due to bacteria but other causes also exist.</p><p>With an inner ear infection, bacteria from a dirty environment or a respiratory infection enters the ear canal. The pressure that the infection causes inside the ear canal may result in a hamster feeling off-balance and in pain. This results in circling when it walks and some hamsters may even fall over.</p><p>Neurological problems due to trauma or a brain disease like epilepsy can also cause circling in hamsters. These issues are not as common as a bacterial infection in the ear but are still possible reasons for this type of behavior.</p><h2>Diagnosing the Cause for Circling in Hamsters </h2><p>While circling in hamsters may be an obvious behavior to observe, in order to know for sure what is causing this some tests may need to be run.</p><p>Since an ear infection is the most likely reason for the circling, debris from inside your hamster's ear may be looked at under a microscope. This will check to see if bacteria from an infection is present and, if it is, an ear infection will be diagnosed.</p><p>Neurological problems are harder to diagnose. If your hamster was recently injured before the circling began then this may mean it suffered some head trauma. Being dropped, grabbed by a dog, or crushed in a door or piece of furniture are all types of injuries that may cause head trauma.</p><p>Seizures are a symptom that will coincide with epilepsy, another neurological issue. There is no test for epilepsy. In these instances, continued close observation may be required and videoing any unusual behavior could be helpful for your vet.</p><h2>Treatment of Circling in Hamsters </h2><p>Persistent or severe circling in hamsters always merits a visit to your veterinarian.</p><p>If the behavior is caused by an ear infection, antibiotics that are safe for a hamster to take will need to be prescribed as treatment. Without them, permanent damage can occur to your hamster's ear and the circling may never stop. Infections can also lead to more serious complications that, in extreme cases, can be life-threatening. Oral antibiotics and sometimes pain medications may be needed to treat the infection. If ear debris is visible a gentle cleaning may also be helpful.</p><p>If the circling is not due to an ear infection then it may be more difficult to treat. Brain damage from seizures or head injury can be permanent. Some circling will resolve over time on its own but some hamsters may have permanent circling. If the circling is so bad that it affects your hamster's quality of life and it is unable to eat then euthanasia may be discussed.</p><h2>How to Prevent Circling in Hamsters </h2><p>Hamsters are small pets that like to hide. It can be difficult to notice when they are acting a little strange in their cages, but regular observation of your hamster's normal activities can help detect the beginning of a problem. This, along with regular cleaning of the cage and washing of the cage accessories, can help prevent ear infections that cause circling.</p><p>In order to prevent head trauma that can result in circling, be sure to only allow children to handle your hamster when they are sitting on the ground. This will decrease the likelihood of your hamster falling and getting hurt. When the child is done holding your hamster, either bring the cage to the floor to put them back in it or gently take your hamster from the child so that you can carefully put it back in its cage yourself.</p><p>Keep your hamster safe if you have dogs or cats in the house when they are out of their cage and make sure that their cage is secure and locked over at all times.</p><p>Accidents can happen but they are far less likely to occur if you supervise carefully and take extra precautions.</p>",724
96,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hamster-health-1236859,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Hamster Health and Diseases</h1>,"<h1>Hamster Health and Diseases</h1><h2>Know the signs of illness in hamsters</h2><p>Hamsters are fairly hardy pets, but they are so small that when injuries and illnesses occur things can become serious quickly. It's helpful to know the most common signs of illness so you can jump on the problem as rapidly as possible. Often it's possible to address an illness or injury before it becomes life-threatening.</p><h2>Most Common Signs of Illness or Injury </h2><p>Hamsters typically show one or more of these signs if they are coping with illness or injury.</p><p>If a hamster is ill or injured, keep them warm and encourage them to take some food or water (by dropper if necessary) until a vet can be seen.</p><h2>Hamster Abscesses </h2><p>Abscesses are pockets of infection that can form from fairly minor breaks in the skin. Pus accumulates under the skin, sometimes forming a sizable lump that may sometimes begin draining on its own. Abscesses can form from cuts or scratches on the skin and also in the cheek pouches if abrasive food material causes scratches in the lining of the mouth. If a hamster continually looks like it has food packed in its cheek pouches, there may be an abscess or an impacted cheek pouch present. Abscesses require veterinary attention for draining, flushing, and treatment with antibiotics.</p><h2>Hamster Respiratory Infections </h2><p>Hamsters can get respiratory infections that can lead to pneumonia. Signs of a respiratory infection include sneezing, discharge from the eyes or nose, wheezing, and labored breathing. Occasional sneezing is not too worrisome, but if there is any loss of appetite, decreased activity, wheezing, or difficulties with breathing, immediate veterinary attention should be sought.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Drafts and sudden temperature changes can put your hamster at risk for developing a respiratory infection and some types of bedding (such as cedar and pine) can irritate the respiratory tract leading to an infection as well.</p><h2>Wet Tail in Hamsters </h2><p>Also called proliferative ileitis, wet tailis a highly contagious diseaseand is most common in recently weaned hamsters. The cause is sometimes uncertain, but bacteria may be involved and in some cases, the disease is associated with stress, crowding, and dietary changes. Affected hamsters may die very quickly, exhibiting signs such as diarrhea (causing wetness around the tail), lethargy, loss of appetite, and a ruffled coat. Not all hamsters with diarrhea have wet tail, but if your hamster has any of these symptoms, you should seek veterinary care.</p><h2>Diarrhea in Hamsters </h2><p>A number of infections can cause diarrhea including, but not limited to,wet tail, dietary changes, intestinal parasites, and treatment with antibiotics. Overfeeding vegetables and other fresh foods is a fairly common cause of diarrhea but, in this case, there is usually no loss of appetite or decrease in activity. Dehydration is a real concern anytime your hamster has diarrhea so make sure they are still drinking their water if it occurs. With diarrhea, withhold fresh foods for a few days and resume offering them only if the diarrhea is completely resolved. Then start back onto fresh foods slowly so that your hamster can slowly adjust to the dietary change. If lethargy or a lack of water intake occurs alongside diarrhea you should seek veterinary care.</p><h2>Skin Diseases in Hamsters </h2><p>Hamsters can be infested with a number of skin and fur mites that can be diagnosed from a skin scraping that your vet performs. Ringworm, a type of fungal infection, allergic dermatitis, and skin infections can also occur on the skin and require treatment by a vet.</p><p>Hair loss is not all that unusual and can be seasonal or happen in older hamsters. But if there is flakiness, redness, or any lesions on the skin, or the hamster appears to be scratching more than usual, a vet should be seen. Hamsters do have scent glands on their flanks which can be dark and sometimes alarm owners. These occur on both sides of the body and should not appear irritated or bother the hamster. Cedar bedding can also cause skin irritation so it should be avoided.</p><h2>Antibiotic Use in Hamsters </h2><p>Several antibiotics can cause fatal toxicity in hamsters due to how their gastrointestinal tract works.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, tetracyclines, lincomycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, cephalosporins, and gentamycin are all types of antibiotics that should be avoided in hamsters.</p><p>Disorders and Diseases of Hamsters.</p><p>Providing a Home for a Hamster.</p><p>Hamsters.</p>",708
97,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-smart-are-rats-3975140,Small Pets > Pet Rats,"<h1>Rat Personality, Intelligence, and Care</h1>","<h1>Rat Personality, Intelligence, and Care</h1><p>While rodents may scare some people and get a bad reputation, rats are extremely intelligent animals and make great pets if you care for them properly. Rats are naturally curious, have astrong memory,and are excellent learners. Theyunderstand complex concepts and once they learn how to do something, it is unlikely that they will forget it. By understanding just how intelligent a rat is, you'll be able to more wholly appreciate these little animals for what they truly are, keep these smart creatures safe, and provide them with proper mental stimulation. Rats are much more than just a naked tail and beady eyes.</p><h2>Rat Are Social Animals </h2><p>Rats are very social animals, often using high-frequency sounds that humans cannot hear to communicate with each other. This is why it is so important to have more than one rat together. They become attached to other rats and recognize their own family members but rats also easily bond with their human owners and make for affectionate pets. Pet rats enjoy being stroked by their owners and sometimes even enjoy a gentle massage, a scratch behind the ears, or a simple tickle. Rats have also been known to return the affection by ""grooming"" their owners.</p><h2>Rats Are Trainable </h2><p>Domesticated rats are very gentle and playful creatures. Like a pet dog, a pet rat can learn many tricks and can even respond to its own name. Pet rats can learn to sit up, fetch, jump through a hoop, come when called, and even walk on a tightrope. Additionally, rats can be taught to solve puzzles, run through mazes, andperform tricks. Training a pet rat is relativelysimple and rats respond well to a food-based reward.There are even a variety of videos online demonstrating how to train a rat.</p><h2>Rats Are Very Clean </h2><p>Domesticated rats do not like getting dirty and are constantly grooming themselves. They are fastidiously clean like cats, and if a rat gets something on its fur it will immediately try to remove it. Rats also enjoy grooming each other and will gather in groups to take part in a group grooming session.</p><p>Rats rarely need to be bathed since they are such good self-cleaners. Old, sick, or obese rats are generally the only ones that will need bathing because they often have difficulty grooming themselves due to osteoarthritis.</p><h2>Housing Rats </h2><p>Your smart pet rat will of course need a cage to live in that will not only keep it safe but provide it with things to keep its mind busy. Some people purchase cages from the pet store while other opt to make their own.</p><p>Wire cages are good options for pet rats and most rats will prefer one with horizontal bars so that they can climb up the sides. The cage can have shelves or multiple levels for the rat to climb on also. Be sure to avoid wire flooring on the bottom of the cage though, as this can injure the rat's feet.</p><p>Soft bedding and nesting materials will also need to be provided in which arat can shred and use to line their nest box. The nest box is where your rat will most likely sleep. A cardboard box is sufficient for this or pet stores sell pre-made nest boxes specifically designed for rodents. Some owners choose to make their own fabric pouch or purchase a handmade rat tent.</p><p>Finally, rats enjoy a wide variety of toys and accessories. Ropes, ladders, hammocks, tubes, enclosed exercise wheels, and chew toys will all be appreciated and well-used by your pet rat. Provide a variety of options on a rotating basis so your rat doesn't get bored with the items and don't be afraid to make toys, too. These items will help keep your rat's brain busy as well as their body healthy.</p><h2>Keeping Rats Safe Outside the Cage </h2><p>Rats also enjoy playtime outside of their cages and can engage in a wide variety of activities like cuddling or running mazes. Be sure that any time outside of the cage is supervised and the area they are in is rat-proofed. Rats will chew on anything in their vicinity. Electrical wires and poisonous plants are the top risks to rats when they are outside of their cages.</p>",698

Foxes are omnivores (like dogs)therefore a balanced diet for a pet fox includes vitamins, minerals, meat, vegetables, and other foods.</p><h2>Protein for Foxes </h2><p>In the wild, foxes generally hunt small rodents. From a very early age, they learn their characteristic pounce to quickly and quietly catch their favorite food. But your pets don't have to hunt in captivity. Instead, you generally should offer a formulated fox food (that contains taurine) since ithas most of what your pet fox needs along with pre-killed mice, small rats, fuzzies, or pinkies depending on the size of the fox.</p><p>Fennec foxes will typically stick with the mice and smaller rodents while red or Siberian foxes can enjoy a rat or even a small rabbit since they are a little bit larger when compared to a fennec. Regardless of the source of the protein, the majority of your fox's diet should be protein.</p><p>Insects are also a large part of a fox's diet. In the wild, a lot of a fox's day is spent foraging for grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, silkworms, beetles, and mealworms in addition to an occasional crustacean (such as a crayfish). Thankfully, in captivity, it is easy to feed a few dozen mealworms, gut-loaded crickets, or larger insects since these are readily available from pet stores.</p><p>Some fox owners alsoopt to feed their pets raw meat. There are mixed feelings about feeding raw foods to pet foxes, but if you choose to offer raw meat to your fox, make sure you are feeding whole prey items, meaning entire chicks, mice, rabbits, and squirrels. Foxes need the organs, skin, and other benefits of the entire animal, not just the muscles as would be provided with a chicken breast or steak.</p><h2>Fruits and Vegetables for Foxes </h2><p>Vegetables, such as mixed frozen vegetables, cherry tomatoes, and other bite-sized veggies, should be offered to your fox daily. For smaller foxes, a few teaspoons of vegetables a day will suffice but offer a few tablespoons for larger foxes. If you notice your fox's stool has a lot of vegetable matter in it, you are probably feeding too many veggies and should cut back on the amount you are offering.</p><p>Fruits should only be offered as treats (unlike vegetables, which should be part of the daily meal for your fox). Foxes especially like berries and many fox owners also recommend giving cherries as treats to help with the odor of their urine. Make sure the cherries are de-pitted before feeding them to the fox. Care should be taken to avoid feeding grapes and raisins due to reports of the kidney damage they can cause.</p><h2>Grains for Foxes </h2><p>Foxes do not eat grains in the wild; therefore, you should avoid feeding things like wheat, rice, oats, and other grain matter in their food. Since foxes instead eat small prey such as mice and birds that eat grains, this is how they get some of the carbohydrates they need. The rest of the carbohydrates they require are found in the fruits and vegetables they consume.</p><h2>Vitamins and Supplements for Foxes </h2><p>Taurine is essential to pet foxes and is typically found in formulated fox diets or grain-free dog foods (as well as the animal tissues you feed). If it isn't already listed as an ingredient in the food you are feeding your fox, you can supplement it with taurine capsules. Please consult your vet before doing so.</p><p>Most of the vitamins and minerals that your fox needs will already be in the grain-free food you feed your fox and the rest of what they need will be in the rodents, insects, and vegetables you offer daily.</p><h3>8 Things to Know Before Adopting a Pet Fox</h3><h2>Keep the Diet Natural </h2><p>Foxes need as close to a natural diet as possible. Although they have quite the taste for sweets and other human foods, care should be taken to avoid feeding any foods other than what was previously recommended. Just because a fox likes something that doesn't mean they should eat it.</p><p>If you are ever unsure what to feed your fox check with your exotics vet for their recommendations.</p>",714
99,https://www.thesprucepets.com/choosing-a-dwarf-hamster-cage-1238926,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Choosing a Dwarf Hamster Cage</h1>,"<h1>Choosing a Dwarf Hamster Cage</h1><p>When choosing a cage for your dwarf hamster, you must consider the size of the cage, if it has protections against escape, safety, and how easy it is to clean. Unfortunately, many cagesthat you will find at the pet store do not meet all these requirements when it comes to dwarf hamstersor Chinese hamsters since they are much smaller than their larger Syrian hamster cousins. Here's how to choose a cage for a dwarf hamster and properly equip it.</p><h2>Style of Dwarf Hamster Cage </h2><p>Your main choices will be between a wire cage (usually on a plastic base), a plastic modular cage (the kind with many compartments and tubes), or an aquarium (with a secure mesh lid). Each style of cage has advantages and disadvantages.</p><h2>Ease of Cleaning the Cage </h2><p>In general, a wire cage with a plastic tray is the easiest to clean. You just lift the wire off the bottom, clean out the bedding, and wipe down the wire part and base as necessary. The more complex the cage, the more difficult it will be to clean, which is very important if you are looking at aplastic cage with multiple compartments and tubes. These cages can become a real chore to clean. Aquariums are not difficult to clean but can be heavy and awkward to handle at cleaning time. Let's face it, cleaning cages is not a fun task, so keeping it easy will make owning a hamster more fun.</p><h2>Ventilation in Cages </h2><p>A wire cage is easily your best option when it comes to talking about ventilation and cages. The tubes and enclosed compartments of plastic modular cages can pose real problems with ventilation so air quality and condensation can become issues. Likewise, aquariums also have inadequate ventilation. Keep in mind that the openness of wire cages gives them great ventilation but means you must also keep the cage out of drafts. Plastic cages and aquariums do offer better protection from drafts.</p><h2>Size of Cages </h2><p>Despite their small size, dwarf hamsters need ample space to run and play, and the actual floor space of the cage is an important factor. In general, many cages marketed for hamsters are too small. According to the California Hamster Association, pet owners should aim for a minimum of 450 square inches when measured from the bottom or about a minimum of 25 inches wide by 18 inches long. When it comes to hamster cages, bigger is always better!</p><h2>Cage Security and Safety </h2><p>The space between the bars on a dwarf hamster cage should be no more than 1/4 inch apart, a dimension that is difficult to find on wire cages that are large enough. Check the doors on any cage to make sure they are secure, as hamsters can become quite the experts at opening doors. If you choose a cage with multiple levels or tubes make sure there is no place where your hamster could fall a long distance.</p><h2>Dwarf Hamster Cages and Chewing </h2><p>The drive and ability of hamsters to chew can affect the type of cage they are suited for. Regarding plastic cages, make sure there are no exposed edges or ridges of plastic where a hamster can start chewing the cage. Otherwise, your hamster is likely to escape at some point. Hamsters are usually unable to chew their way out of a wire cage, but some hamsters become almost obsessive about chewing the bars. Aquariums are advantageous in this regard, as there is usually nothing that can be chewed on.</p><h2>Running Wheelsfor Dwarf Hamsters </h2><p>Hamsters should have wheels, and wheels should be large enough that the hamsters don't have to arch their backs to run on the wheel. Wheels should have a solid surface and no crossbars for support so no limbs or other body parts can get caught. Run-about balls are another good option for outside of the cage.</p><h2>Beddingfor Dwarf Hamsters </h2><p>No matter what style of cage you choose, make sure you can provide a nice deep layer of bedding for burrowing. This is especially important with wire-sided cages. Choose one with a nice deep tray that not only allows a thick layer of bedding but also will help to reduce the amount of bedding your hamster will push or kick out of the cage.</p>",706
100,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guinea-pig-heat-stroke-1238204,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>Heatstroke in Guinea Pigs</h1>,"<h1>Heatstroke in Guinea Pigs</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Heatstroke seems like an unlikely affliction for Guinea pigs, which are native to South America and can be found in a variety of areas from forests to swamps to savannas. But, these rodents are surprisingly sensitive to sudden changes in their environments. High temperatures, in particular, can be harmful, potentially causing lethargy, seizures, and even death. Knowing how to prevent heatstroke and recognize signs of Guinea pig distress may help save your pet's life.</p><h2>What Is Heatstroke? </h2><p>Heatstroke occurs when a Guinea pig's body temperature gets too high. A Guinea pig's normal body temperature ranges between 102 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and environmental temperatures above that range are risky for this animal. Serious internal damage, such as inflammation and blood clotting issues, can occur when a Guinea pig overheats.</p><h2>Symptoms of Heatstroke in Guinea Pigs </h2><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The signs of heatstroke in a guinea pig may seem subtle at first, but if you notice your guinea pig is slower and more lethargic than usual, these could be the first indications that it is overheating.</p><p>Rapid breathing may be seen if you watch its chest and see that it is moving more quickly than usual. Panting or open-mouth breathing may also be observed.</p><p>An overheated Guinea pig may drool excessively or lie limply on its side. In severe cases, it may experience seizures. If heatstroke symptoms are not quickly addressed, coma and death can occur.</p><h2>Causes of Heatstroke </h2><p>Heatstroke in Guinea pigs can happen in less than an hour and can result from anything that makes a Guinea pig's body get too warm too quickly.</p><h2>Diagnosing Heatstroke in Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Diagnosing heatstroke is straightforward based on symptoms and, more importantly, the environment surrounding a Guinea pig. High heat, or recent exposure to direct sunlight or a heat source, should immediately inform an owner and a veterinarian of the condition.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If you suspect your Guinea pig is developing or has heatstroke, immediately get it to a cooler location. This may mean you need to bring it into an air-conditioned house, move it out of direct sunlight, or get it away from a heat vent whatever it takes to cool your Guinea pig down.</p><p>If your Guinea pig is so weak that it cannot stand, is non-responsive, or is having seizures, it needs to see a veterinarian immediately.</p><p>Many Guinea pigs with severe heatstroke are also dehydrated and have low blood sugar levels. After your pig has cooled down a bit, offer a high-calorie, liquid herbivore supplement like EmerAid or Critical Care (you may need to syringe feed).</p><p>A veterinarian will be able to determine if your Guinea pig needs IV or subcutaneous fluids to correct dehydration, oxygen therapy may be indicated, and an oral sugar solution or medications to treat specific symptoms of heatstroke might also be necessary.</p><h2>Prognosis for Guinea Pigs with Heatstroke </h2><p>How well a Guinea pig recovers is largely dependent on the severity and duration of the heatstroke. Intense heat may quickly kill a Guinea pig, but milder cases of overheating will likely be recoverable and inflict no long-lasting damage.</p><h2>How to Prevent Heatstroke in Guinea Pigs </h2><p>There are some simple ways you can help prevent your Guinea pig from ever developing heatstroke.</p><p>If you plan on taking your Guinea pig outside with you on a hot day, be sure to keep it out of the sun and limit its time outdoors. (If it is over 80 degrees Fahrenheit outside, it is best to keep your Guinea pig indoors.) If the outside temperature is under 80 degrees, find a shady spot in the grass to place your pig, and offer plenty of water to drink with some fresh, dark, leafy greens to help keep your Guinea pig hydrated and happy.</p><p>If your Guinea pig needs to take a car ride with you on a warm day, make sure you don't leave it in the car without the air conditioning on.

A fan or some other sort of air circulation should be present to keep your Guinea pig cool. Lastly, avoid placing its enclosure in front of a heat vent or sunny window.</p>",698

Sugar glider ""ick"" is the common name for this syndrome that has many symptoms but is recognizable due primarily to the change in coat appearance in gliders that are affected. It is called ick because of the ""icky"" appearance of the fur.</p><h2>What Is Sugar Glider Ick? </h2><p>Ick (not to be confused with freshwater fish ick/ich) is the name for a syndrome that causes a variety of symptoms. Diarrhea, a lack of appetite (anorexia), oozing from the pouch, and primarily a sticky feel, especially on the belly of a sugar glider, resulting in matting of the fur and an unkempt appearance, are all seen in gliders with ick. Death can occur in untreated sugar gliders due to anorexia.</p><h2>What Causes Sugar Glider Ick? </h2><p>It is suspected that the main culprit for ick in sugar gliders is a microscopic protozoan calledaccording to Dr. Cathy Johnson-Delaney. This is a parasite that lives in the intestinal tract of affected sugar gliders and is thought to be the cause for diarrhea and poor coat quality. It is usually seen in young sugar gliders called joeys. Stress is also suspected to play a role in the cause of this disease.</p><h2>How Do You Diagnose a Sugar Glider With Ick? </h2><p>Fecal matter is needed to diagnose ick in a sugar glider. Special testing (fecal wet mounts and fecal PCR's) by your exotics veterinarian and outside laboratories can find this parasite so your glider can be treated appropriately. Symptoms of the disease will also be taken into consideration as will groups of sugar gliders since this is a very contagious disease for colonies but many other diseases can look similar to ick (such as mastitis, malnutrition, stress, septicemia, gastroenteritis, failure to groom, etc.). It is also important to remember that if one sugar glider has ick then it is most likely true that your entire family of sugar gliders has ick.</p><h2>How is Sugar Glider Ick Treated? </h2><p>Thankfully successful treatment can be accomplished by your exotics veterinarian by administering a course of medicine that helps with diarrhea, kills off the parasite, and prevents any secondary infection from the parasite. This medication is given in the mouth for 10-14 days in addition to subcutaneous fluid therapy (fluids injected under the skin), probiotics, and syringe feeding. Special marsupial formulas to hand feed can be purchased online from Australia otherwise many people are successful in using homemade formulas. The Leadbeater's Formula is often mixed with one part puppy replacement formula, half a part of unfiltered apple juice, calcium powder, and probiotics to hand feed a sick glider. This provides extra nutrition for a sugar glider diagnosed with</p><h2>Can Sugar Glider Ick Be Cured? </h2><p>Yes! Many sugar glider families have been cured of ick after the proper course of treatment from their exotics vet and continued to test negative for the protozoan years later. Some individuals feel as though any sugar glider that tests positive or shows symptoms of ick should be euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease but this is unnecessary. Ick can be cured if it is caught right away and if the treatment plans are followed by the owner. Sugar gliders that are left malnourished without being syringe fed will become dehydrated and die therefore medications, fluid therapy, and assisted feeding are all vital to the success of any glider with this syndrome.</p><h2>Where Do Sugar Gliders Get Ick? </h2><p>It is not known for sure where sugar gliders get this protozoan from but we do know it is contagious from glider to glider. Some sugar gliders may simply be carriers of the disease. Handling gliders outside of your household could potentially bring this parasite into your colony as could outdoor exposure. You should always wash your hands after handling your sugar glider or someone else's (especially if it is at a pet store or breeder's house) and understand that risks are involved if you let your sugar glider walk around outside on the ground.</p>",703
102,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guinea-pig-heat-cycles-1238881,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>Guinea Pig Heat Cycles</h1>,"<h1>Guinea Pig Heat Cycles</h1><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Female guinea pigs have a uterus, like every other female mammal, that hasn't been surgically altered. Although they may have the same body parts as humans, dogs, and other species that bleed during their estrus cycles, bleeding during heat is not normal for guinea pigs. Therefore, if a female guinea pig is bleeding, she needs to see an exotics vet as soon as possible.</p><h2>Then Where Is the Blood From? </h2><p>It is possible the bleeding could still be from your guinea pig's uterus, but if that's the case, it is not normal. She may have a serious problem with her ovaries, uterus, or even her bladder. Infections, tumors, and uroliths (bladder stones) are some issues that can cause bleeding.</p><h2>Pyometra </h2><p>Guinea pigs can get a pyometra (which literally means ""pus in the uterus"") just like dogs and cats do and it is caused by a bad infection. Antibiotics are not strong enough to fight off that bad of an infection, so emergency surgery to spay the guinea pig is the only cure.</p><h2>Uroliths </h2><p>Bladder stones, also known as uroliths, are also common in cavies. Bladder stones are caused when microscopic crystals in the bladder clump together to form a stone. These crystals are formed from changes in the pH of the urine, and some research suggests that a diet high in calcium is also at fault. Surgery is the only alternative to remove stones too large to pass through the urethra. An exotics vet will rule out bladder stones by taking radiographs.</p><h2>Urinary Tract Infection </h2><p>An infection in the urinary tract (UTI) and cystitis (inflammation of the bladder) can cause blood to pass in the urine. Don't be fooled by dark brown/red urine which can be porphyrin staining in the urine. Sightings of blood-tinged bedding or drips appearing when she isn't trying to urinate may have pet owners thinking that the bleeding is coming from the uterus, but it could be from her urine instead. If a cavy urinates on a non-porous surface, such as a hard kitchen floor or empty plastic litter box, try to collect the urine with a syringe or pipette to bring to an exotics vet. You can place a small amount of hydrogen peroxide onto the urine to see if it bubbles, which can indicate blood is present. The doctor will test the urine for infection and confirm the guinea pig has a UTI or cystitis.</p><h2>Tumors </h2><p>A mass or tumor, whether or not it's cancerous, on any part of a guinea pig's reproductive tract or urinary tract may cause her to pass blood. The mass may be irritating to whatever organ it is attached to or may have even started bleeding itself, and the guinea pig is just passing the blood. If this is the case, surgery is once again what is required to see if the tumor can be removed.</p><h2>Surgical Concerns </h2><p>Any time surgery is performed risks are involved. Guinea pigs stress very easily, and since they are very difficult to intubate during surgery, it can be difficult to keep an open airway. Always keep the risks in mind and see an experienced exotics vet to operate on your beloved cavy. Experts also recommend bringing the other guinea pigs along with the sick guinea pig to the hospital in order to help keep her calm.</p><h2>Preventative Measures </h2><p>To avoid the possibility of a guinea pig getting a tumor or infection in her reproductive tract, get her spayed at about 4 to 12 months of age. This will also prevent her from getting pregnant after her pelvic bones fuse.</p><p>To aid in the prevention of uroliths be sure to feed your guinea pig a balanced and appropriate diet of green veggies, timothy hay (alfalfa if your guinea pig is less than 6 months old or pregnant or lactating), or sweetgrass, and a small number of pellets alongside adequate fluid intake and vitamin C. Know that a diet consisting of alfalfa hay in adult cavies and a large number of alfalfa pellets can help uroliths form.</p>",705
103,https://www.thesprucepets.com/gut-loading-prey-items-for-exotic-pets-1237243,Small Pets > Exotic Pets,<h1>How Gut Loading Works</h1>,"<h1>How Gut Loading Works</h1><p>If you care for a reptile or amphibian, you may be feeding it live insects. These insects act as food for your pet, but what's inside the insect will determine how nutritious a meal it really is. Gut loading provides assurance that you are feeding your pet nutrient-dense insects and can help prevent some serious issues from developing due to malnutrition.</p><h2>What Is Gut Loading? </h2><p>Gut loading is the act of feeding your pet's live food before your pet eats it. This is done so that your pet will eat a more nutritious meal. Crickets, mealworms, superworms, and other insects that are commonly used as food don't have a lot of nutritional value to them if they haven't recently eaten a meal. By gut loading these prey items, your pet will consume not only the insects, but everything the insects just ate as well.</p><h2>How Do You Gut Load Prey? </h2><p>A good insect gut load should consist of nutritious fruits, fish flakes, vegetables, grains, or chicken starter feed along with a calcium supplement. Products marketed as gut load can also be purchased and fed to your prey items; calcium powders can be sprinkled on the gut load prior to feeding it. Simply putting the insects in a container with some of these items will entice them to eat and gut load themselves.</p><p>Calcium supplementation is the main focus of gut loading and research has been done to examine the amount of time between gut loading and feeding your pet. While it depends on the type of insect and gut load, as a general rule, gut loading should be done within 24-72 hours of feeding the prey to your pet in order for it to receive the full benefits. If you wait more than two or three days to feed the gut loaded prey to your pet, then it isn't much different than if you hadn't gut loaded them at all. Additionally, feeding a variety of types of insects is beneficial to your pet, so you should rotate gut loading crickets, mealworms, superworms, and other insects to your reptile or amphibian.</p><p>Vitamins A and D may also need to be added to your gut load. Many insectivores need to consume these vitamins in their diets, especially if they don't have a UVB light, so depending on the type of gut load you use, you may also need to sprinkle a vitamin A and D supplement on the gut load or prey.</p><h2>Why Is Gut Loading Important? </h2><p>Reptiles and amphibians that primarily eat insects rely on the nutrition these insects provide to grow and stay healthy and strong. If they do not consume the appropriate nutrients from their diet, they can develop a variety of health issues.</p><p>Metabolic bone disease, also known as nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, is one common health issue that can affect pets that don't eat gut loaded insects. Since gut loading should include a calcium supplement and food that contains adequate vitamins, insects that don't contain these minerals and don't have a source of UVB lighting won't provide your reptile or amphibian with enough beneficial calcium and vitamin D to keep its bones strong. Bones can then become soft, bowed, and break, muscle tremors can occur, and even paralysis can develop if the disease gets bad enough. This can be avoided if calcium is provided in a gut load, proper UVB lighting is available, and vitamin D is present in the food either naturally or as a supplement.</p><p>Hypovitaminosis can also occur if insects aren't gut loaded prior to feeding them to your pet. While low vitamin D levels can contribute to metabolic bone disease, low vitamin A levels can cause skin issues, lethargy, and a decrease in appetite. Low vitamin B and E levels may also occur, but is more common in reptiles and amphibians that eat fish instead of insects. Hypervitaminosis, the opposite of hypovitaminosis, may also be seen but if the recommended amounts of vitamins are used, this is not a major concern. Ensuring that prey items are being fed nutritious gut load food is important, otherwise supplemental vitamins need to be added in addition to the calcium.</p>",718
104,https://www.thesprucepets.com/homemade-toys-for-pet-rats-1238516,Small Pets > Pet Rats,<h1>DIY Toys for Pet Rats Using Stuff You Already Have</h1>,"<h1>DIY Toys for Pet Rats Using Stuff You Already Have</h1><p>Pet rats are intelligent and playful. They need a variety of toys to keep them amused and active. With a little creativity, you can provide inexpensive and entertaining homemade toys to supplement any store-bought toys.</p><h3>Safety First </h3><p>The most important thing when choosing any pet toy is that it is safe. Anything you give your rat must be nontoxic; you should also watch for any bits that might be swallowed and could cause a blockage of the digestive tract. Threads of fabric and ropes can cause intestinal blockages and loose threads might become wrapped around toes or pose a strangulation risk. Fleece toys are a good choice since they don't include ropes or threads.</p><h2>Cardboard </h2><p>Cardboard boxes and rolls from paper towels and toilet paper make good toys. Boxes are great for hiding in, though they will often be shredded fairly quickly (but that's fun too!)</p><p>Another great idea is to take a variety of boxes and other items to create a rat playhouse for enjoyment outside of the cage during playtime. Tape together a bunch of boxes and create a network of rooms connected by doors, ramps, bridges, and ladders.</p><h2>Paper </h2><p>Most rats love shredding paper. Plain brown paper lunch bags are great for playing in as well as shredding. Crumpled up paper makes for a fun, if temporary, ball. Your rats will likely love digging, diving, and hiding in a plastic bin or box filled with crumpled or shredded paper. Paper towels and tissues are also great for shredding and your rats can make a nice bed out of these. Try wrapping or folding a piece of paper in layers around a favorite treat; shredding and unwrapping the treat will keep your rat busy for a while.</p><h2>Wood and Nuts </h2><p>Wood is good for chewing, which rats need to do to keep their teeth in good condition. Make sure wood is untreated, not painted, and non-toxic. Branches from apple or willow trees are good as well, just make sure they are pesticide free. Hard-shelled nuts provide good chewing opportunities as well as a tasty treat inside. Give them sparingly as many nuts are high in fats.</p><h2>Digging Box </h2><p>Most rats love a digging box. Take a small cat litter pan or other shallow plastic box and fill it halfway with plain sterilized potting soil (not treated with any chemicals or fertilizer and with no additives like vermiculite). Plant some birdseed or wheat grass and water it to let the seeds sprout and grow for a bit, then let your rats go crazy in the box. To minimize the mess, avoid watering the box for a day or two before offering it to your rats and place it a bathtub or spread a tablecloth or newspapers around the box to contain the mess. Your rats will love to dig in the soil and snack on the sprouts or seeds.</p><h2>Tubes and Tunnels </h2><p>PVC pipe is pretty indestructible and comes in a variety of sizes and configurations. You can buy it at your local hardware store. Buy a simple straight piece or use a variety of connectors to create a network of tubes. Choose a size you are sure your rats will be able to fit through without getting stuck. If you are handy with a sewing machine, you can also make great collapsible tubes out of fleece or other sturdy fabrics. Sew a ring cut from a plastic bottle or wide cardboard tube into the ends to help hold it open. Sleeves cut off old sweatshirts are also handy tubes/sleep sacks.</p><h2>Other Containers for Hiding and Climbing </h2><p>Clean jars and clay plant pots placed on their sides make neat hiding spots for rats. Mini stacking bins (like those meant for office or workshop supplies) make great hiding spots too. Washed coconut shells are also good for hiding, climbing, and chewing.</p><h2>Rope </h2><p>Rats are very agile and like to climb on ropes. You can make little rope ladders and bridges for in the cage. Cotton ropes are available in thick widths and are usually at hardware or horse supply stores. Just make sure the configuration of ropes doesn't pose a strangulation risk and that your rats are not unraveling the threads.</p>",701
105,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-do-ferrets-stink-5191296,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Why Do Ferrets Stink?</h1>,"<h1>Why Do Ferrets Stink?</h1><p>Ferrets are popular pets, but many people note that they have a distinct odor to them. This musky smell is something that most ferret owners get used to and eventually don't even notice, but sometimes the stink is worse than it should be. By understanding the cause of the normal smell and what might cause it to be problematic, you can keep your ferret's odor to a minimum.</p><h2>Why Do Ferrets Stink? </h2><p>Just like dogs and cats, ferrets are born with anal glands that are located on either side of their rectum. These glands secrete a foul smelling fluid that is used to mark territory. Nearly all pet ferrets sold in pet stores have their anal glands removed at a very young age, through a process called descenting. Because of this procedure, it means that the anal glands are not usually the cause of a pet ferret's earthy or musky smell.</p><p>Despite being descented, ferrets still have other glands besides their anal glands that secrete scented substances. Sebaceous glands are located on the skin of ferrets and produce secretions that give ferrets their unique, normal smells. These glands are also larger in male and female ferrets that have not been spayed or neutered so intact ferrets will smell worse than those that have been fixed.</p><p>But in addition to anal and sebaceous glands, ferrets can have problematic smells. They can get their feces on their feet and fur, especially if they have diarrhea, develop ear infections, and have dental problems that can result in unwanted smells. A dirty environment and poor quality food will also contribute to your ferret being stinkier than it should be due to the effects these things can have on the health of the skin and fur.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If your ferret stinks, the first thing you should do is ensure it is spayed or neutered. Almost all pet ferrets are fixed at a young age so if this is not a concern for your ferret, then the next thing you can do is make sure your ferret's enclosure is clean. Throw away the dirty cage bedding, wash the blankets, empty the litter box, and wipe down all surfaces with a pet-safe cleaner. Replace the litter, bedding, and blankets with clean options and add an air purifier to your ferret's ferret-proofed room.</p><p>Next, assess your ferret's diet. If your ferret is eating a low-quality ferret or cat food, improve its level of nutrition to boost its skin and fur health. Opt for a high-protein, high-fat, low-fiber, and low-carbohydrate ferret kibble or whole prey. Ferrets that don't eat appropriate food may develop oily, smelly skin and fur as well as soft, extra-smelly stools, so correcting a ferret's diet often results in a less stinky pet.</p><p>If your ferret is simply dirty, a quick bath in mild dish soap, ferret, kitten, or puppy shampoo should do the trick. Be sure to thoroughly clean between its toes, clean its ears with a pet-safe ear cleaner, and don't allow it to get chilled or overheated. Towel your ferret dry and place it back in its clean enclosure while you enjoy how it no longer stinks.</p><h2>How to Prevent Ferrets From Stinking </h2><p>Your ferret may always have its special scent but that doesn't mean it has to stink. To keep your spayed or neutered ferret from stinking, there are a few things you can do.</p><p>Maintain a clean cage with thorough, weekly cleanings, remove fecal matter from the litter box on a daily basis, and continually feed a high-quality ferret kibble or whole prey diet to keep its skin and coat healthy. Keep your ferret's skin and coat clean with the occasional bath and use wipes to freshen your ferret's fur, especially after it eats whole prey or uses the litter box. Additionally, if you are feeding whole prey, feed it to your ferret outside or on a surface that can be easily cleaned such as a plastic trash bag or in a large plastic storage container. Finally, consider using an air purifier in the room where your ferret lives to keep the air fresh and choose an odor-absorbing litter for its litter box.</p>",715

They're cute balls of fluffy fur that are amusing to watch and fun to play with and care for. When choosing a guinea pig to adopt, there are a few things you'll want to look for to help you determine if the animal is healthy.</p><h2>Good Physical Attributes </h2><p>Look at the guinea pig's overall body condition. A guinea pig should be neither fat nor skinny, with no swelling, lumps, or bumps.</p><p>The guinea pig's coat should be well-groomed (full, fluffy, and smooth looking), with no bare patches. Avoid guinea pigs with bald patches or red patches of skin. Also check for soiling around the rear end, as this may indicate a problem with diarrhea.</p><p>The eyes, nose, and ears should be clean and free from discharge. Check the fur around the eyes and nose for signs of wetness, staining, or crusts.</p><p>Try to get a look at the teeth as well. They should not be overgrown and should be well-aligned. Also, check for wet or matted fur on the chin.</p><p>Observe the guinea pig's breathing. It should be quiet and not labored, with no wheezing, clicking, or gurgling noises.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Guinea pigs should be bright and curious in attitude and never lethargic. You want an active and alert guinea pig. Take as long as you need to watch the guinea pig move around. It should have no signs of lameness, stiffness, or reluctance to move around.</p><p>Observe how the guinea pig reacts to people. Many tend to be skittish at first, which is understandable in a pet store, breeder, or animal shelter situation. Ideally, try to pick a guinea pig that is relatively calm when it's approached and who is relatively okay with being handled.</p><p>Look at the guinea pig's surroundings. The cage should be clean, with good access to fresh food and water, and not overcrowded. Guinea pigs kept under good conditions will be less stressed and have less exposure to disease.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs to Pass on Bringing Home </h2><p>If any of the guinea pigs in the same cage, shelter, breeder, or store seem ill, resist the temptation to adopt from that place. If there is a contagious illness, your guinea pig may be next and there may be possible heartbreak ahead.</p><p>Familiarize yourself with the differences between male and female guinea pigs. Make sure that wherever you get your guinea pig, they house the males and females separately. If the place does not separate them or seems unsure about the gender of the guinea pigs, then move on. It is best to avoid the possibility of a surprise litter after you get home.</p><p>Do not get a piglet younger than six weeks old. Female piglets should remain with their mothers until at least four weeks old. You want to add a few weeks after mother separation to make sure the piglet can thrive on its own.</p><h2>Where to Get Your Guinea Pig </h2><p>Before you try a store or breeder, look to a shelter or your local guinea pig rescue. There are many guinea pigs who need a second chance at a forever home. Quite often, these pets are given up because their previous owner simply could not care for them or they didn't get along with another pet in the household. There are typically very few behavior problems to worry about when adopting a rescue guinea pig, but you will want to be observant after you add a new guinea pig to a home with another guinea pig. Sometimes these pets don't get along well with each other.</p><p>If you go to a breeder, make sure they are breeding for specific goals such as temperament and health. And, if you go to a store, make sure you can handle the guinea pig before you buy it. Do a quick health check and assess its temperament.</p><p>As much as you may really want a guinea pig right away, feel free to walk away if something doesn't feel right. There are many excellent breeders and pet stores out there, but you may also come across ones that are less than reputable or keep their animals in unhealthy situations.</p>",707

Knowing how to prevent broken legs and what to do if you suspect your chinchilla has one can help your pet avoid prolonged pain.</p><h2>What is a Broken Leg? </h2><p>It's common for a chinchilla's tibias to break because they are very delicate and lack any padding. A broken chinchilla leg could be a simple fracture with a broken bone and no skin wounds. The break could also be a compound fracture, which involves a broken bone and broken skin, which is more severe and could become infected if left untreated.</p><h2>Symptoms of a Broken Leg in a Chinchilla </h2><p>If you suspect your chinchilla broke its leg you should get it to a veterinarian as soon as possible. Your chinchilla will be in a lot of pain if it does have a broken leg and the stress its little body goes through from the accident along with the pain is enough to kill it.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Skin Wound </h3><p>If the broken leg is a compound fracture, there will be a skin wound in the area, also called a hematoma. If you have more than one chinchilla in a cage, the wound could be from a bite during a tussle and not a broken leg, but your veterinarian can diagnose the problem.</p><h3>Protruding Bone </h3><p>A compound fracture in the leg can also cause the bone to protrude through the skin.</p><h3>Dragging Legs/Limping </h3><p>Your pet will naturally not be able to walk correctly so it will drag its hind legs or limp if it has a broken leg.</p><h3>Avoiding Upper Levels of Cage </h3><p>A chinchilla with a broken leg will not want to climb to an upper level because of the pain.</p><h3>Lethargy </h3><p>Any animal with a medical condition will exhibit lethargy because it is in pain and stressed.</p><h2>Causes of a Broken Leg </h2><p>There are many causes that can put a chinchilla's tiny legs in danger of breaking.</p><h2>Diagnosing a Broken Leg in a Chinchilla </h2><p>Your vet may be able to tell if the leg is broken without X-rays but an X-ray is the best way to see where the bone is exactly broken. This will help your veterinarian create the best treatment plan so your chinchilla can heal properly.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If the leg is broken and it is a simple facture without any skin wounds, the vet can typically splint the leg so it can heal, but it also depends on where the break is located and how long the bone has been broken.</p><p>A more severe broken chinchilla leg may need to have surgery to place pins in it to hold it together so it can heal. If surgery to repair the fracture is not an option, the leg may need to be surgically amputated under anesthesia to save your pet's life.</p><p>Medications to manage any pain, inflammation, and infection will be recommended and syringe feeding may need to be performed. If a chinchilla stops eating then ileus can occur and your pet can have a fatal outcome.</p><p>You will need a single-level cage to restrict your chinchilla's activity restriction to allow the bone to heal. Keeping your chinchilla resting will not be easy since it will still try to hop and jump around in the cage. X-rays may need to be repeated to monitor the healing process.</p><h2>Prognosis for a Chinchilla With Broken Legs </h2><p>A chinchilla may do well while it has a splint or bandage on its leg, depending on the complexity of the break. If a surgical pin is involved, a good outcome is possible if there are no complications such as a loosened pin or infection. If the leg has been amputated, a chinchilla will usually adapt very well to the loss of the leg.</p>",668

For certain small pets such as rabbits, hamsters, birds, lizards, and other animals that can reside in a cage, this might end up becoming a problem if they stay home for too long while their owners are out.</p><p>What are the best practices for ensuring your pet can stay safe and cozy in your home even in the coldest temperatures? Read on to find out important things to remember when keeping such pets in cold climates. </p><h2>Treat Your Pet With Care </h2><p>""Otherwise-healthy animals like rabbits and guinea pigs can get stressed and suffer from (digestive disorder) GI stasis if the weather gets too cold,"" said Dr. Crystal Matt, an avian medicine resident at the Avian and Exotic Animal Clinic of Indianapolis.</p><p>If your pets have GI stasis, having their critical care feeding formula on-hand is important.</p><p>Unlike cats and dogs, which have been domesticated for thousands of years, most other pets (especially reptiles) are not made to live in the conditions we do. They need specialized environmental conditions, and some are very intolerant of change. Matt emphasized to make sure your pet is healthycold weather comes.</p><p>Routine wellness exams can help prevent worsening of hidden diseases. Pets are just as able to catch illness as humans, as many of our small friends are much more sensitive to heat.</p><h2>Keep Heat Accessible </h2><p>Matt advises small-pet owners to make sure you have a backup heat source available for your pet. Check with your veterinarian regarding what kinds of heat are safe for your pets (birds are very sensitive to air contaminants!).</p><p>She advises to be sure to have heating options that are battery-powered in case the power goes out, and save water bottles in case pipes freeze.</p><p>""Air-activated hand warmers make great heat support for small animals too,"" Matt said. She added to be sure to place a layer of fabric between the pet and the heat source for safety. Some people will even use a hot water bottle, or a warmed-up potato in a travel cage when taking their animals to the vet for heat!</p><h2>Prepare in Advance </h2><p> Snow storms are still common this time of year, and Matt advises owners to make sure you have adequate carriers and heating options for all of your pets.  Plenty of accidents (including failing heaters) can occur while you're gone, and catching problems early or thinking ahead is the best way to keep your pets safe, she said.</p><p>Ask a friend, neighbor, or boarding facility if you would be able to bring your pets to their space in times of dangerous weather or power outages. A backup plan is important to keep an eye on their health and care.</p><p>Overall, it is a good practice to make sure your pets have someone to monitor them if you are gone for long periods of time.</p><p>""Even if your pet (such as a large reptile) only needs to eat occasionally, you should ask a friend or neighbor to check in on them regularly,"" Matt said.</p><h2>Be Cautious of Overheating </h2><p>While supplemental heat is very important, we can also overheat our animals, which can be just as dangerous.</p><p>Ensure that your pet has the opportunity to get away from supplemental heat sources if they're feeling too hot. Some small pets, such as Chinchillas, are especially prone to the risks of overheating, and are actually much more cold-tolerant.</p><p>On top of that, humidity can often be a problem for pets at home. Just like our human skin gets dry and cracked in cold weather, our exotic small pets can suffer from low ambient humidity as well, per Matt.</p><p>Most reptile species need much higher humidity levels than average room air provides and become severely ill when spending long periods in low humidity.</p><h2>Talk to Your Vet </h2><p>It may seem like an obvious answer, but Matt advises all small pet owners to talk to their vet about the best humidity ranges for your pet.</p><p>Veterinarians are always happy to help advise owners on how to properly care for their pets, and when in doubt, they're the best person to help you understand the health risks of your specific type of pet.</p>",702
109,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lop-eared-rabbits-1239327,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>A Guide to Lop Eared Rabbits and Care</h1>,"<h1>A Guide to Lop Eared Rabbits and Care</h1><p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Lop-eared rabbits are easily recognizable due to their large, floppy ears. The American Rabbit Breeders Association accepts five varieties, and new lop-eared rabbit breeds are constantly being bred. Lop-eared rabbits are very popular with house rabbit owners, but sometimes their characteristic ears also need a little extra attention. Make sure your lop's ears are clean on both the inside and the outside since these ears can be prone to a build-up of debris.</p><h2>French Lops </h2><p>One of the largest breeds of lop-eared rabbits, the French lop was developed in France by crossing two existing breeds of lops. French lops weigh in at around 10 pounds and have ears that hang below the jaw and reach over a foot long. They should be housed in a large outdoor enclosure with a companion rabbit or indoors with plenty of space to exercise. These are not the most commonly seen type of pet lop, but their ears are impressive to see if you ever get the chance to meet one.</p><h2>The Mini Lop </h2><p>Not to be confused with the United Kingdom's dwarf lop or miniature lop, the mini lop is the second smallest lop-eared variety in the United States. The mini lop is very popular at rabbit shows and can weigh over 6 pounds (larger than many people imagine a mini lop to get). Housing requirements are not as demanding as the larger lop varieties according to the Mini Lop Rabbit Club of America. These lops are very commonly found as house rabbits.</p><h2>The Original Lops </h2><p>One of the two pre-existing lop-eared rabbitbreeds used to create French Lops, English Lops are the original lops. They are known to be quite inactive, so obesity is a major problem with the breed. A large hutch is required because of their size. Their ears average 20 inches in length, the largest of any rabbit breed, and at 4 weeks of age, their ears are actually longer than their body!</p><h2>The American Fuzzy </h2> <p>Distinctively short and fluffy wool sets the American fuzzy lop apart from the similar Holland lop. Reaching 4 pounds at adulthood, this breed of lop-eared rabbit is very compact and resembles the Holland lop, except for the wool coat which is very similar to that of the Angora rabbit. They are very playful, full of personality, and enjoy companionship with people and other rabbits. Their wool can be difficult to keep clean and manage.</p><h2>A True Dwarf </h2><p>Averaging 3.5 pounds, these lops are the ideal house pet. They are non-aggressive and are different from the American fuzzy lop in that they have fur, not wool, and they are a true dwarf variety. They are small and make great little house pets. These are highly popular rabbits for kids due to their small size.</p><h2>Caring for Lop-Eared Rabbits </h2><p>In addition to basic rabbit care, all lop-eared rabbits require special attention to their ears. Due to their size, folded position, and delicate nature, injuries to and infections within the ears are common but easily avoided with proper care.</p><h2>How to Buy </h2><p>Lops can be purchased from private breeders, pet stores, county fairs, and 4-H clubs, or adopted from a rabbit rescue organization. Pet store, county fair, and 4-H rabbits are typically inexpensive, averaging about $20. Private breeders charge about $40, but show-quality rabbits may sell for much more. Prices will certainly vary depending on the breed and show thehistory of the rabbit, and rescue rabbits are certainly widely available if you do not have a strong preference.</p><p>Lop bunnies should be fed about 80% hay, some grain-free pellets, and lots of fruits and vegetables.</p><p>Yes! They're friendly, not aggressive, and get along with adults and children alike.</p><p>Lop bunnies live from six to eight years old.</p><p>These large bunnies can grow to be about ten pounds, but usually, they're about 3 1/2 pounds.</p",664
110,https://www.thesprucepets.com/problems-with-pet-monkeys-1237180,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Problems With Keeping a Pet Monkey</h1>,"<h1>Problems With Keeping a Pet Monkey</h1><p>Taking on a pet monkey is not like caring for most other pets. A well-cared-for monkey can generally live to be anywhere from 20 to 40 years old, and it will need your full commitment throughout its entire life. Sweet babies grow up into difficult adult monkeys and do not generally make good pets.</p><p>We break down the challenges that come with keeping a pet monkey, including behavioral, medical, and legal issues you may encounter.</p><h2>The Challenges of Raising a Monkey </h2><p>Monkeys do not grow up and mature as human children do. They are, in essence, permanent toddlers. Pet monkeys also might not take well to new people in your life, including spouses and children, and they make it hard to get away for vacations. Plus, finding a new home for a pet monkey is extremely difficult and psychologically hard on the monkey.</p><p>Furthermore, a monkey needs a large amount of social interaction.A pet monkey deprived of your time and attention will likely develop not only severe behavioral problems, such as screaming and biting but also psychological issues that can be difficult to remedy.</p><h2>Legal Issues </h2><p>Primates, such as monkeys, might be illegal to keep as pets where you live. And if a monkey is legal to own, permits still might be required. Sometimes permit holders are subject to home inspections to ensure proper facilities and care are being provided.</p><p>Moreover, homeowner policies might require additional liability coverage, or some insurance companies might cancel your policy altogether if they find out you have a monkey. However, not having insurance puts you at risk if your monkey bites someone.</p><h2>Medical Issues </h2><p>A wide range of diseases can be passed between monkeys and humans. (These are called zoonotic diseases and can be quite serious.)But finding a veterinarian near you who is able and willing to treat a primate can be challenging.</p><p>In addition, it can be difficult to keep a captive monkey healthy. For instance, monkeys often require specialized diets that can be expensive and time-consuming to prepare. Diabetes is common in pet monkeys due to the poor diets many owners feed them. This is just one disease that requires constant monitoring by you and your vet.</p><h2>Behavioral Problems </h2><p>A sweet, dependent baby monkey will eventually grow up to become the wild animal it was meant to be. Raising a monkey around humans won't change its wild nature, and pet monkeys will never truly become domesticated. In fact, depriving a pet monkey of normal social relationships with other monkeys can create behavioral problems and neuroses.</p><p>Pet monkeys often have a tendency to bite (and they have 32 teeth to deliver these nasty bites). While some monkeys are gentle, some are very aggressive. However, even the gentlest monkeys are unpredictable and might turn aggressive on anyone, including the person to whom they are the closest, especially during and after puberty.</p><h2>Housing Pet Monkeys </h2><p>Monkeys need a large, secure enclosure, which can be expensive to construct. They should spend time outdoors if possible. And they must be provided with a wide variety of ever-changing toys and exercise equipment to keep them challenged, or they will suffer from boredom. Some states require certain types of enclosures to fulfill permit regulations, but you should always have a place to secure your monkey to keep it and the public safe.</p><p>Moreover, monkeys are not clean and tidy. Most can't be effectively toilet trained. Many young monkeys can be diapered or at least partly toilet trained, but that ability is often lost at maturity. Plus, they might engage in distasteful activities involving their feces and urine (such as throwing it and painting with it).Aside from the toileting messes, pet monkeys also can be extremely mischievous and destructive, especially when they're bored.</p><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p>Overall, monkeys are not good pets. Yes, some can be quite sweet for a time. But the reality is monkeys are capable of causing too much harm and need too much care and attention to thrive in a human household. These issues are equally as important when it comes to apes (chimpanzees, orangutans, and gibbons). In short, non-human primates and human beings make poor housemates.</p>",696
111,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cystic-ovaries-in-guinea-pigs-1238212,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>Cystic Ovaries in Guinea Pigs</h1>,"<h1>Cystic Ovaries in Guinea Pigs</h1><p>Female guinea pigs, which are also referred to as cavies, have reproductive organs that can become infected, plagued with cancer, impregnated, cystic and develop other problems if not removed. The ovaries, just like in human women, can develop cysts that can cause a number of issues, including pain, in your guinea pig but thankfully these cystic issues can be avoided with a simple surgical procedure.</p><h2>What are Ovaries? </h2><p>Ovaries are the egg excreting part of the reproductive tract in humans and animals. They are located on both ends of the ""V"" shaped uterus that female guinea pigs have and are also small glands that secrete hormones. These glands are very complicated and develop normal, important things including follicles, corpus luteum from the empty follicle, and eggs, but they can also create fluid filled cysts that cause problems for female guinea pigs who have not been spayed.</p><h2>What are Cysts? </h2><p>A cyst is simply a pocket in the tissue that is filled with some sort of material such as air, pus, or another fluid. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled pockets or bubbles inside your female guinea pig's ovaries that develop when the follicles inside the ovaries don't release the eggs they are supposed to do. Humans also get many different kinds of ovarian cysts.</p><h2>Why are Cystic Ovaries a Problem in Guinea Pigs? </h2><p>The biggest concern with cystic ovaries in guinea pigs is when they burst, which can be extremely painful. A guinea pig is already uncomfortable prior to a cyst bursting and because guinea pigs will stop eating and defecating when they experience discomfort or pain, simply having cysts, even if they don't pop, can be life threatening if your guinea pig develops ileus.</p><p>Ileus, or GI stasis, will cause a guinea pig to die if it is not addressed immediately.</p><h2>How Do You Know if Your Guinea Pig Has Cystic Ovaries? </h2><p>An obvious symptom of ovarian cysts is symmetrical alopecia on your guinea pig's abdomen. This hair loss that is the same on both sides of your guinea pig's belly is a tell-tale sign that it has ovarian problems. Many owners bring their guinea pig into their exotics vet for hair loss thinking their pet has some sort of external parasite like lice and instead discover there is a much bigger reason for the alopecia.</p><p>Your exotics vet may be able to feel a large cyst or pair of cysts inside your guinea pig along with abdominal discomfort when they are performing a physical exam. Your veterinarian may then recommend an X-ray or abdominal ultrasound to confirm the presence or absence of cystic ovaries. They may also attempt to sample the fluid in the cyst by inserting a needle into the abdomen and into the cyst in order to make a diagnosis.</p><h2>What Can Be Done for Cystic Ovaries? </h2><p>The only way to ""fix"" cystic ovaries it by removing them. Typically a full ovariohysterectomy, often called a spay, is recommended as soon as possible for your guinea pig. Your exotics vet will spay your guinea pig as they normally would, even if it didn't have cystic ovaries, and this will get rid of your guinea pig's problems and prevent them from happening again.</p><h2>What Other Problems Can Guinea Pig Ovaries Have? </h2><p>In addition to developing cysts, guinea pig ovaries can also unfortunately develop tumors and cancer. The best way to prevent it from occurring in your guinea pig is to have it spayed. Spaying a guinea pig completely removes the ovaries if an ovariohysterectomy is performed.</p><p>In people, a hysterectomy is usually only done and not an ovariohysterectomy. This means only the uterus is removed in people but usually the ovaries are removed along with the uterus in pets. This is a routine procedure for any veterinarian experienced with guinea pigs.</p><p>Ovaries also play an important role in allowing a guinea pig to get pregnant. The ovaries release the eggs and can be fertilized if a male and female guinea pig copulate. Baby guinea pigs are not something most pet owners want since they require more time, space, and finances to care for.</p>",692
112,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-hamsters-eat-cheese-5200205,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Can Hamsters Eat Cheese?</h1>,"<h1>Can Hamsters Eat Cheese?</h1><p>Cheese has been associated with rodents for ages, and cartoons have a lot to do with this. Do rodents really love cheese? Some do, and hamsters are rodents that tend to enjoy a variety of snacks and treats, and these often include cheese. But is cheese healthy for hamsters? Cheese may be safe in small amounts, but there are better snack options for hamsters. </p><h2>Is Cheese Good for Hamsters? </h2><p>Cheese can be safe for hamsters in small quantities, but it is not an essential part of their diet.</p><p>Hamsters are omnivores that can enjoy a variety of foods. In the wild, hamsters tend to eat seeds, grain, grasses, and occasionally insects. Fortunately, complete and balanced commercial diets are available to ensure pet hamsters get everything they need. Hamster food usually comes in pellets or mixes and typically contains grains, seeds, vitamins, and minerals.</p><p>In general, hamsters should eat at least 50% commercial hamster food and up to 50% raw vegetables in order to remain healthy. Many fresh raw vegetables are good for hamsters, including kale, spinach, dandelion greens, and broccoli. They can eat small quantities of fruit like apples and bananas. Other healthy treats include pasta, rice, and seeds. Small quantities of unsalted nuts can be given and well. Hamsters do not need high amounts of fat, sugar, or salt in their diets, so foods with these should be avoided. They do not require any dairy products in their diets, so there is technically no need to ever offer cheese to a hamster.</p><p>Many hamsters love the taste of cheese, but its high fat and sodium content is not especially healthy for hamsters. If your hamster enjoys cheese and seems to tolerate it well, you can offer it occasionally in small amounts. Hamsters should get no more than a pea-sized amount of cheese just once or twice a week. Choose a cheese that is low in fat and salt, like low-fat cottage cheese or mozzarella. Avoid fatty or salty cheeses like aged cheddar, parmesan, and processed cheese products. Never offer your hamster ""moldy"" types of cheese such as Stilton or blue cheese as these may be harmful.</p><p>If your hamster loves cheese, it can be a great option for training and giving oral medications. Just remember to feed it sparingly.</p><h2>Side Effects of Feeding Hamsters Cheese </h2><p>Cheese is not toxic to hamsters. However, too much cheese can lead to health problems.</p><p>Some hamsters tolerate cheese and other dairy products well, but others experience lactose intolerance. Hamsters may develop vomiting and/or diarrhea after eating cheese or other dairy products. If you are not sure if your hamster can tolerate cheese, start with tiny amounts of cheese and watch how your hamster handles it. If no diarrhea or vomiting occurs, gradually work up to a pea-sized amount of cheese at a time.</p><p>Hamsters may become overweight if they are given too much cheese, especially if the cheese is high in fat. Too much salt (from cheese or other salty snacks) can lead to dehydration and kidney problems in hamsters.</p><p>Don't give your hamster too much cheese; he may try to put it in his cheek pouches and bring it back for storage in his habitat. It won't be long before that cheese goes bad. Hamster lovers often enjoy seeing those cute chubby cheeks all filled up, but some foods (like gooey cheese) can become stuck in the cheek pouches.</p><h2>What to Do If Your Hamster Has Too Much Cheese </h2><p>Mistakes happen, and you may find that your hamster has had more than his fair share of cheese. Overeating cheese once or twice is not likely to harm a hamster, but it's always important to watch for signs of illness such as lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. Be sure to contact an exotic veterinarian for advice if you are concerned about your hamster's health.</p><p>Hamsters tend to store their food for later, so that extra cheese may be in their cheeks or somewhere in their habitats. Check your hamster's habitat and bedding for hidden stashes of cheese and get rid of them. If you are in doubt about feeding cheese to your hamster, it's probably best to avoid it entirely and choose a healthier type of treat.</p>",698
113,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-feed-rabbits-1237194,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>What to Feed Pet Rabbits</h1>,"<h1>What to Feed Pet Rabbits</h1><p>What a rabbit wants to eat and what a rabbit should eat are two different things. Since a rabbit's digestive system is sensitive, it is important to know what your rabbit needs to consume.</p><h2>What to Feed Rabbits </h2><p>Fiber is vital to the normal function of the digestive system in rabbits. Fresh grass hay and vegetables should make up the bulk of the diet for house rabbits. Feeding a diet consisting mainly of pellets may result in obesity and increase the likelihood of digestive problems for your pet rabbit.</p><p>While there is some fiber in pellets, it is finely ground and does not appear to stimulate intestinal function as well as the fiber found in grass hays. The addition of some pellets does add some balance to the diet, however, if your rabbit is a picky eater.</p><p>Anything other than hay, vegetables, and pellets is considered a treat and should be feed in strict moderation. The number of pellets should be restricted, especially in overweight rabbits, but any reduction in pellets should be made up with a variety of fresh vegetables and unlimited access to hay. </p><h2>Feeding Rabbits Hay </h2><p>Hay (specifically grass hays, such as timothy or oat hay) should be available at all times to your rabbit. Some rabbits may not eat much hay at first, but by adding fresh hay a couple of times a day and reducing the number of pellets you offer, your rabbit will likely become hungry enough to eat the hay. For young rabbits, hay should primarily be alfalfa for calcium content but as they transition to timothy, oat hay, or botanical hay.</p><h2>Vegetables for Rabbits </h2><p>Vegetables should make up a large portion of your rabbit's diet. A variety must be fed daily to ensure a balanced diet. Suggested vegetables to feed include carrots, carrot tops, parsley, broccoli, collard greens, mustard greens, dandelion greens, turnip greens, endive, romaine lettuce, kale, and spinach. However, kale, spinach, and mustard greens are high in oxalates, which can lead to bladder stone formation, so their feeding should be limited. Beans, cauliflower, cabbage, and potatoes may cause problems and should be avoided. Iceberg lettuce has almost no nutritional value and can cause diarrhea, so it should be avoided as well.</p><p>Vegetables should be introduced to bunnies at or older than 12 weeks of age, in small quantities, and one at a time. As more vegetables are added, reduce the amount of pellets being provided and watch for diarrhea- discontinue the most recently added vegetable if this occurs.</p><h2>Feeding Rabbit Pellets </h2><p>Pellets are basically designed for commercial rabbit productionand are quite high in calories. As a result, house rabbits fed unlimited pellets may end up with obesity and related health problems, as well as an excess of other nutrients. Pellets do have a place in rabbit nutrition, as they are rich and balanced in nutrients. However, experts recommend restricting the number of pellets fed and instead feed more fresh vegetables and grass hays.</p><p>Choose a fresh, good quality pellet. The House Rabbit Society recommends a minimum of 20-25 percent fiber, around 14 percent protein (no animal protein), and less than 1 percent calcium for most house rabbits (spayed/neutered). For adults, the amount should be carefully regulated depending on the size, by weight, of the rabbit.</p><p>As a rule, give about 1/4 cup of pellets to rabbits 5 to 7 lbs., 1/2 cup for 8 to 10 lb. rabbits, and 3/4 cup for 11 to 15 lb. rabbits. Baby rabbits can be fed pellets free choice (available at all times) and then the amount can be decreased to 1/2 cup per 6 lb. of body weight by around 6 months of age.</p><h2>Treats for Rabbits </h2><p>The House Rabbit Society recommends that 6-pound mature adult rabbits (1 to 5 years) be feed 2 tablespoons of fresh fruit daily as a treat. Treats sold in pet stores marketed for rabbits are generally unnecessary, and in some cases could cause digestive problems due to their high carbohydrate or sugar content. Also, as an alternative to food treats, consider offering twigs from apple or willow trees (pesticide-free only) or other rabbit safe woods.</p>",689

They are affectionate and bond with their owners, quiet for a large part of the day, and there are few pets as playful as ferrets. However, they seem to have garnered a negative image which is largely undeserved. If you are considering a ferret, learn more about how ferrets make good pets.</p><h3>Click Play to Watch the Top 7 Reasons Ferrets Make Good Pets</h3><h2>Ferrets Are Cute </h2><p>With mischievous eyes and sweet faces, ferrets are undeniably adorable. They are a small size and can provide your family with a sweet long-term pet. Most ferrets live for aboutsix to eight years, though some pet ferrets can live up to 12 years. Female ferrets usually grow to 13 to 14 inches long and weigh anywhere from three-quarters of a pound to two and a half pounds. Male ferrets are often slightly larger. They typically grow to 15 to 16 inches long and weigh two to three and a half pounds if neutered. They can grow larger (four or more pounds) if they are not neutered.</p><h2>Ferrets Are Playful and Curious </h2><p>They will entertain you endlessly with their antics and will happily play with ferret toys, tubes, and tunnels. Watching ferrets play for the sheer joy of it is guaranteed to lift your mood. Owning pets has proven health benefits for the owner because of the joy and affection they bring.</p><h2>Ferrets Are Sociable, Friendly, and Affectionate </h2><p>It is often recommended (though not essential) to have more than one pet ferret. Having two or more ferrets increases the fun factor for the owner and the ferrets as they will interact and play together, sometimes with wild abandon. Despite having other ferrets to socialize with, they will still crave attention from their owners.</p><h2>Ferrets Are Intelligent </h2><p>Some owners are amazed at how adept ferrets become at solving problems. Ferrets are very determined and will work at figuring something out with surprising persistence. They enjoy challenging puzzles and games and it's recommended to provide them with puzzle-based toys or games.</p><h2>Ferrets Are Quiet </h2><p>While they can and do vocalize, for the most part, ferrets are very quiet. The most noise they will make is if they are very frightened or injured. They also sleep away a large portion of the day.</p><h2>Ferrets Are Small </h2><p>Ferrets don't need a huge cage, though the bigger the better. Ideal ferret cages are tall with multiple levels, so they still don't take up too much room. They do need to spend time out of their cage every day for playtime and exercise.</p><h2>Ferrets Are Easy to Feed </h2><p>This is especially true now that a variety of good-quality ferret foods have become more widely available. Pre-made ferret food is available in most pet stores or online retailers. While you can offer them a variety of foods, it's helpful to use high-quality pet food as the base to ensure proper nutrition.</p><h2>Ferrets Can Be Litter Trained </h2><p>Ferrets can be trained to go in a box, though not to the same extent as cats and there are bound to be a few accidents. Most ferrets can be fairly reliably trained to use a litter box in and out of their cages. This is a big plus when you have them out for exercise for a couple of hours a day!</p><h2>Ferrets Are Easy to Exercise </h2><p>They can get all the exercise they need tearing around your (ferret-proofed) home!With a ferret-sized harness and a little training, you can take them out for a stroll. Few things will start a conversation with strangers faster than walking your ferret in the park!</p><h2>Ferret Have Distinct Personalities </h2><p>Every ferret is unique and has its own personality. Some are independent and some are very cuddly, but each is an individual! If you are thinking about having a pet ferret, it can be helpful to meet a few pet ferrets first. You'll see how their personalities will vary and give you a good sense of what it means to be a ferret owner.</p>",674
115,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mouse-teeth-1238479,Small Pets > Pet Mice,<h1>Caring for Mouse Teeth</h1>,"<h1>Caring for Mouse Teeth</h1><p>Not all pets have problems with their teeth but pet mice have unique teeth that can have serious issues. Some of the teeth in a mouse's mouth grow continuously throughout their life and these teeth need to be filed down to a normal length. Knowing how to help your mouse keep these teeth trimmed naturally and what to do if they don't is important for any mouse owner to know.</p><h2>What Kind of Teeth Do Mice Have? </h2><p>Dogs, cats, humans and many other species are born with no teeth, then grow baby teeth, and then lose those baby teeth so that their adult teeth can take their places. Mice, on the other hand, only have one set of teeth their entire lives. These teeth are called monophyodontal teeth and appear as young as ten days of age in a mouse.</p><p>Mice have twelve molars and four incisors and while the molars never grow, the incisors continuously grow which can sometimes cause problems for your mouse.These incisors are the front teeth and in mice they are naturally colored yellow. They are also much harder than human teeth. The two bottom incisors are almost twice as long as the two upper incisors but this can be hard to see since a large portion of these teeth are hidden underneath your mouse's lips.</p><h2>Overgrown Mouse Teeth </h2><p>Mouse teeth will grow very quickly with an entire tooth turnover rate of 35-45 days. The incisors, or front teeth, are usually easy to identify when they become very overgrown since they begin to stick out of the mouse's mouth. They will usually grow so long that they begin to curl and poke out between the lips. At this point they can become stuck on things, or worse yet, grow into the gums or roof of your mouse's mouth. Since the molars, or teeth in the back of the mouth, do not grow, they are not a problem like they can be in guinea pigs and rabbits.</p><p>Most mice will wear their incisors down to an appropriate length when they gnaw on their food but some mice are unable to do so if they are born with misaligned teeth or jaws. Misalignment or malocclusion may prevent a mouse from chewing normally and therefore not wear its teeth down. If trauma to the teeth or jaw occurs at some point in a mouse's life, this can also cause a problem with normal chewing and the normal wearing down of teeth. If a mouse has this issue, regular tooth trims will be needed to help it keep its incisors at a normal length and prevent a mouse from being unable to eat.</p><h2>Tooth Trims for Mice </h2><p>If you aren't sure if your mouse's teeth are a normal length, you'll need to gently pull back the cheeks and lips to make sure the teeth aren't curling into the mouse's mouth or cheeks. If the teeth are curling, they are too long and will need to be trimmed.</p><p>If done correctly, tooth trims are not painful and there are two common methods used to trim incisors. The first is by using regular nail clippers or blunt scissors to cut the teeth like you would a toenail. This method is not the preferred way to trim teeth since there is a high risk of cracking or splitting a tooth. Because of the force needed to use the clippers or scissors, the tooth can crack and can cause pain if it cracks up to the nerve or is trimmed too short. The second method of trimming teeth is with a handheld rotary tool, like a Dremel, with a cut-off wheel to slice the teeth. This method does require a bit more skill, along with anesthesia or sedation since mice are often squirmy and have small mouths, but can be easily performed by a trained veterinary professional. The only concerns are for trauma to the gums or lips if the wheel accidentally grazes them or if the tooth is trimmed too short. Cracking a tooth with a rotary tool is not typically a concern though the expense of anesthesia or sedation often causes people to choose to use clippers or scissors instead.</p>",695

Aim for a minimum of 2 cubic feet of space per rat. The wire spacing is important too no more than 1-inch by 2-inch spaces for adults and smaller for babies. Avoid wire-bottomed cages. Most of the cages here have wire second floors or balconies, and it would be preferable to cover any wire with wood or another solid material to create a surface easier on rat feet (wire floors have been implicated as a cause of bumblefoot).</p><h2>Martin's Skyscraper (R-695) </h2><p>This is a good-sized cage at a decent price. At 30 inches by 18 inches by 36 inches, it is a large cage and a ton of extra space is provided by two balconies and a full middle floor (three ramps total). All Martin's cages feature a drop-in plastic pan. They are available in galvanized or powder coat finishes and most are now available with a handy flip-top lid. However, mostof Martin's cages have balconies are made of wire mesh which should be at least partly covered for foot comfort.</p><h2>Martin's Cages Rat Tower (R-690) </h2><p>At 24 inches by 14 inches by 36 inches, this cage is as tall as the Skyscraper but is a little smaller in length and width. However, it also features a full middle floor and two balconies (and three ramps) so it provides lots of additional space. Like other Martin's cages, it is available in galvanized or powder coat finish and with a flip-top lid.</p><h2>Martin's The Rat Retreat (R-685) </h2><p>At 30 inches by 18 inches by 24 inches, this is a good-sized cage, made roomier by a full second level. The ramp is designed with a landing so as not to be too steep. The cage has a full flip-top for access to the top level, and a 3.5-inch drop-in style plastic pan. It is available in galvanized or powder coated, but not in a flip-top.</p><h2>The Rat Highrise (H-600HR) </h2><p>While this cage has smaller overall dimensions (18 inches by 11 inches by 24 inches), it features two balconies as well as a full middle floor to make up for it. This gives your rats more extra space vertically while not taking up too much room a bonus if you have a small home. Like other Martin's cages, it is available in galvanized or powder coat finishesand has a drop-in plastic pan. It is also quite inexpensive.</p><h2>Martin's Rat Lodge (R-680) </h2><p>At 30 inches by 18 inches by 24 inches with two balconies and two ramps, this cage is a decent size at a fair price. It is not as large as some of the other cages but still more than adequate for a couple of rats.</p><h2>The Ruud Cage (R-699) </h2><p>This is the roomiest cage intended for rats virtually a palace at 30 inches by 18 inches by 60 inches. It features seven levels, six ramps, four balconies, and two full floors. A solid black pan forms the floor of the cage. It is available in galvanized and powder-coated metal. While more expensive, it is quite reasonable for such a huge cage.</p><h2>Martin's Aquarium Toppers </h2><p>These are a unique way to convert old fish tanks into great rat cages. The unit sits on top of aquariums with a ladder to connect the aquarium to the levels of the wire cage. The two-story toppers (available for either 10- or 20-gallon tanks) would convert relatively small tanks into spacious three-story cages. A major advantage of this style is that you can provide a nice thick layer of bedding that your rats will have a hard time kicking out all over your floor.</p><h2>The Rat Cabin (R-670) </h2><p>Another inexpensive selection from Martin's, this cage is getting a little on the small size for a pair of rats at 24 inches by 14 inches by 24 inches. However, there are two small balconies with ramps that help provide extra floor space and exercise opportunities. A 3-inch drop-in pan helps contain the bedding. The cage is available in galvanized or powder coat finishes, with an optional flip-top lid.</p>",676

She is a member of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants. Kayla also works with cats and birds, including falcons and homing pigeons.</p><p>When purchasing food for a guinea pig, you must remember that guinea pigs are herbivores. They primarily eat hay, but love fruits and veggies too. Their teeth are constantly growing, so they need things to chew on. Whilesomehuman food is safe for your guinea pig to eat, feeding guinea pigs should involve far more care than just giving them table scraps.</p><h2>What Do Guinea Pigs Eat? </h2><p>At the most basic level, guinea pigs are herbivores. That means that they just eat fruits and veggies no dairy, eggs, meat, or insects for these little guys. Fresh hay and fresh leafy vegetables should make up the bulk of your guinea pig's diet.</p> <p>That said, it's also important not to transition your guinea pig's diet too quickly. If needed, be sure to go slow while you transition your guinea pig from her original diet in her old home or from the pet store to a healthier diet.</p><p>You might also catch your guinea pig eating her own poop, but don't be alarmed! Guinea pigs actually produce two different types of feces. One is soft and nutritious, and the guinea pigs re-ingest this to get more nutrients. Rabbits do the same thing!</p><p>The other type of poop is harder and is produced after the food has been digested twice. That's the poop that you clean up when you clean your guinea pig's cage!</p><h2>When Should I Feed My Guinea Pig? </h2><p>Like most herbivores, guinea pigs are essentially grazers. They munch on hay and veggies all day. That means it's important to keep fresh hay available constantly.</p><p>It's best to dump out your guinea pig's food and water every day, clean the bowls, and fill them with fresh food and water.</p><h2>Feeding Guinea Pigs Store-Bought Food </h2><p>Most owners will opt to feed their guinea pigs store-bought pellets and hay. Be sure to purchase pellets that are specifically formulated for guinea pigs.</p><p>For hay, a mix of timothy, orchard, and oat is best. Some alfalfa hay is acceptable but it contains too much calcium to be the main part of your pet's diet. Guinea pig hay needs to be stored in a cool, dry place to stay clear of mold or mildew.</p><p>Supplement your guinea pig's hay with a small amount of high-quality pellets. Opt for plain pellets rather than a mix, as this prevents your guinea pig from just picking out the tasty bits and ignoring the healthy ones!</p><h2>Feeding Guinea Pigs Fresh Foods </h2><p>Fresh fruits and veggies are great treats and supplements for your guinea pig. Vegetables and fruits are great treats to offer your guinea pig. You can use these as extra-special offerings to help bond with your guinea pig or as treats for training.</p> <p>Offer your guinea pig more vegetables than fruits. She might love fruits, but they're like candy for guinea pigs! Always be sure to clean up any uneaten fresh foods at the end of the day to avoid mold or rot.</p><h2>Toxic Foods for Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Not all fruits and veggies are safe for guinea pigs to eat.</p><p>These foods are actually dangerous for many pets. These same foods often pop up on lists of toxic foods for dogs, parrots, and cats.</p><p>Always avoid feeding your guinea pig sweet or salty human ""junk food,"" even if none of the ingredients are toxic. Since guinea pigs can't eat garlic or onions, much of our cooked food is off-limits as well. It's generally best to stick to feeding your guinea pig a diet of hay and high-quality pellets, with occasional treats of fresh fruits and veggies.</p>",654
118,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-ferrets-bite-5186410,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Do Ferrets Bite?</h1>,"<h1>Do Ferrets Bite?</h1><p>Ferrets are very popular pets and while they are often considered caged pets, they actually do much better in ferret-proofed rooms. They love to play, explore, and sleep so they are a lot like a small puppy or kitten and therefore may also bite at times. Knowing more about the normal behavior of ferrets, including why they may bite, can help you stay safe and also avoid upsetting your ferret.</p><h2>Why Do Ferrets Bite? </h2><p>Ferrets may bite for a variety of reasons, but these reasons aren't unlike other species of animals that have teeth. Some bites may be intentional while others may be accidental.</p><h2>Ferret Teeth </h2><p>Once a ferret loses its baby teeth it will have 34 adult teeth. These teeth are sharp and used to tear prey apart but can also deliver a nasty bite. Ferret teeth require maintenance so it is important for your ferret to chew and bite at things to keep them clean, but your fingers and toes are obviously not ideal. Incisors, canines, premolars, and molars make up your ferret's teeth but the canines are usually the teeth that grab and hang onto the item a ferret is biting. These are the four large, single rooted teeth in the front of the mouth that are commonly referred to as fangs.</p><h2>Ferrets and Rabies </h2><p>Ferrets are able to contract rabies so in most places they are legally required to have a rabies vaccine. This is not only to protect your ferret but to protect you.</p><p>Ferret rabies vaccines are usually administered yearly by your veterinarian and if you or another person are ever bitten by your ferret and require medical attention, proof of the rabies vaccine will be required. If your ferret is not vaccinated for rabies and bites someone but appears healthy at the time of the bite, it will be required to be held in quarantine for 10 days. This typically has to be done at an animal hospital and cared for by rabies-vaccinated individuals so boarding fees will be charged. This makes not vaccinating your ferret for rabies not only dangerous to your ferret, you, and potentially others, but it's also expensive to have to quarantine it if it does bite someone. Additionally, veterinarians have the right to refuse to treat a ferret if it is not current on its rabies vaccine. If your ferret needs medical attention, not having had it vaccinated for rabies could delay treatment.</p><h2>What to Do If Your Ferret Bites You </h2><p>If your ferret bites you and it breaks the skin, be sure to wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and contact your doctor to see if medical treatment is necessary. Antibiotics and pain medications may be necessary, depending on where your ferret bit you and how deep the wound is.</p><p>Do not punish your ferret by hitting it, kicking it, or throwing it if it bites you. You should never hurt your ferret; plus, it will not understand that what it did was wrong with punishment. Simply walk away if your ferret bites you or if you need to move them, gently scruff them. A two to three minute time-out is okay but anything longer than that is not helpful.</p><h2>How to Deter a Ferret From Biting </h2><p>If you're worried about your ferret biting you then there are a few things you can do to limit the possibility of it happening. Regular socialization from a young age will make it less likely that your ferret will become aggressive towards people; washing your hands after eating and before handling your ferret will decrease the chance of your ferret biting you because it smells food; and being careful not to startle your ferret when it is sleeping can help prevent you from accidentally scaring it.</p><p>If your ferret is prone to biting, try to determine what is causing it. Is it teething, scared, or just playing? Provide appropriate chew toys and, last but not least, get it checked out by a veterinarian to make sure there is no underlying illness or pain that could be causing the unwanted behavior.</p>",676

You may not have known that there are 13 species of guinea pigs, and they all have their share of unique characteristics. Learn more about each of them below, and make sure you know which one you're going for before adopting a guinea pig.</p><h2>American </h2><p>This breed is also known as the English Cavy. The coat is smooth and short and lies flat to the body. This is the most popular and common breed.</p><p>The Satin American is also recognized by the American Cavy Breeders Association (ACBA). Satin refers to the sheen of the coat; the satin breeds have very shiny, sleek coats.</p><h2>Abyssinian Guinea Pig </h2><p>The Abyssinian has a very distinctive appearance. The coat is made up of multiple swirls of hair referred to as rosettes. Their hair is quite dense and coarse and it radiates in circles from multiple points on the body comprising a series of whirls and ridges. For show purposes, Abyssinian must have a minimum of eight rosettes, in a symmetrical pattern. These guinea pigs always look somewhat disheveled.</p><p>The Satin Abyssinian, with its shiny coat, is also recognized by the ACBA.</p><p>(The Abyssinian photoabove is courtesy of Odd Fellows Caviary.)</p><h2>Peruvian Guinea Pig </h2><p>The Peruvian coat is smooth and straight and grows to several inches in length. The hair naturally parts down the center of the back and also grows forward over the head.</p><p>The dense, soft coat of the Peruvian requires a great deal of grooming, and many owners of Peruvian guinea pigs end up trimming the hair to keep it manageable. If the guinea pig is to be shown, wraps can be used to keep the hair from getting tangled or soiled.</p><p>The ACBA also recognizes the Peruvian Satin.</p><h2>Silkie Guinea Pig </h2><p>The Silkie is also known as the Sheltie, and it has a very silky, long coat. In contrast to the Peruvian, the Silkie's soft coat does not naturally part along the back, and it grows backwards from the head.</p><p>A Silkie Satin is also recognized by the ACBA.</p><p>(This Silkie photo is courtesy of Sunflower Cavies.)</p><h2>The Crested Guinea Pig </h2><p>This is a short haired guinea pig with a single rosette (swirl) on the forehead. There are two types -- one is the White Crested Guinea Pig (also called American Crested), where the crest is white in contrast with the rest of the coat (there's no white on the body). The other is a ""self"" crested guinea pig (sometimes called English crested), and the crest color is the same as the rest of the coat.</p><p>This Crested guinea pig photo is courtesy of Odd Fellows Caviary.</p><h2>The Teddy Guinea Pig </h2><p>This short haired guinea pig is characterized by a short dense coat with bent or kinked hair shafts that makes the coat stand on end, giving a fuzzy appearance.</p><p>There is also a Satin Teddy whose coat has a deep sheen.</p><h2>Texel Guinea Pig </h2><p>This uncommon guinea pig has a very distinctive long, curly coat. The Texel guinea pig is a very high-maintenance pet.</p><h2>Coronet Guinea Pig </h2><p>The Coronet Guinea Pig is also long-haired, but has a single rosette (coronet) in the center of the forehead. Like other long-haired guinea pigs, Coronets need lots of grooming.</p><p>(This Coronet photo is courtesy of Sunflower Cavies.)</p><h2>Other Varieties of Guinea Pigs </h2><p>There are some other less common varieties of guinea pigs with different types of hair such as the Merino (long curly hair with a crest on the head) and the Alpaca (long curly hair that grows forward over the head). In addition, there are many color variations which are also used to describe guinea pigs along with the breed.</p><p>There are also two kinds of hairless guinea pigs. The Baldwin Guinea Pig is totally hairless, although it can be born with some hair which is then lost as the guinea pig matures. ""Skinny Pigs"" are hairless as well, but often not completely as there may be patches of hair on the face and paws along with fine hair on other parts of the body.

Originally, it referred to species that were considered wild animals and not typically kept as domestic pets. However, there is now a legal basis for what's considered an exotic pet. Though it's often subject to local jurisdiction, a partial federal law describes an exotic animal as one that is native to a foreign country or of foreign origin or character, not native to the United States, or was introduced from abroad. When these pets need medical care, you will need to seek care from an exotics veterinarian.</p><h3>Watch Now: 11 Wildly Exotic Animals That You Can Have as a Pet</h3><h2>Amphibians </h2><p>Frogs and toads that can be considered an exotic pet include African Clawed Frogs, Dwarf Clawed Frogs, Fire Bellied Toads, and Northern Leopard Frogs. Amphibians have thin, fragile skin that can dry out quickly and damage easily if handled roughly. They also absorb toxins and germs through their skin, so they should be handled as little as possible, and when they are handled, they should be touched only with moistened gloves and not bare skin. In general, amphibians like frogs, salamanders, and newts are typically harder to care for than most reptiles, so most amphibians are not ideal for families with children. However, Pacman frogs can make great pets when maintained properly.</p><h2>Birds </h2><p>Finches and cockatiels are commonplace when it comes to pet birds, but a number of people care for exotic birds as pets, too. This includes parrots such as African Greys, a medium-sized parrot that's incredibly intelligent, or Amazons that are vocal. Other exotic birds include Canary Wing Bee Bees, Cockatoos, and the brightly colored Lories. Before you buy an exotic bird, make sure you have a cage that's large enough to accommodate it and that you're aware of its long lifespan.</p><h2>Insects and Arachnids </h2><p>Madagascar hissing cockroaches, praying mantis, and stick insects are more exciting than ants, particularly the latter two one for its prayerful stance and the other for its ability to camouflage with its woodland surroundings.</p><p>Some people like to keep scorpions, which are docile but can sting. Though the venom of some scorpions can be deadly, the most common scorpion kept as a pet is an emperor scorpion. Their sting, which is generally mild and not fatal, feels similar to a bee sting.</p><p>As for arachnids, tarantulas are an option. Keeping a tarantula is a big responsibility as somehave a lifespan of up to 25 years. But they are also easy to care for, need little attention, and you only have to feed them a few times per week, depending on the species.</p><h2>Reptiles </h2><p>The category of reptiles includes some of the most ancient species on Earth. In general, reptiles require less daily care and exercise than other pets; however, they require special skills to care for properly and can suffer serious health consequences from improper diets, handling, or habitats. Regardless of species, all reptiles (and amphibians, too) can potentially carry Salmonella bacteria, so these pets are not meant for very young children who might handle them and then put their hands in their mouths.Potential exotic reptiles include Anoles,Bearded Dragons, Burmese Pythons, Ornate Box Turtles, and Chinese Water Dragons.</p><h2>Rodents </h2><p>There are a lot of pets that are considered rodents: chinchillas, mice, gerbils, prairie dogs, and rats. Some things to consider when you are thinking about getting a rodent pet are whether they are nocturnal creatures that sleep during the day or if they keep a schedule more like you and are awake when the sun is up. Other rodents that are popular as pets include Degus, Syrian Hamsters, Chinese Hamsters, and Capybaras.</p><h2>Other Exotic Pets </h2><p>Regardless of which kind of animal you decide to keep as an exotic pet, do your research prior to acquiring one so that you can care for it properly. The following pets don't fit in a particular category but are sometimes kept as pets as well.</p>",679

122,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-hedgehog-diseases-1238234,Small Pets > Hedgehogs,<h1>5 Common Hedgehog Diseases</h1>,"<h1>5 Common Hedgehog Diseases</h1><p>African Pygmy hedgehogs are more popular than you may think, andthey are more than just a caged pet. Hedgehogs are prone to several serious diseases, some of which can be avoided. While there isn't any hedgehog health census tracking every disease of every pet hedgehog, these are some of the most prevalent diseases we see in our spiny friends, in no particular order.</p><h2>Dental Disease </h2><p>Hedgehogs have up to 44 teeth in their tiny, V-shaped mouths. These teeth are like miniature versions of our teeth and are prone to similar dental issues. Fractured teeth, abscessed teeth, gingivitis, and tartar accumulation can all cause problems in our little hedgies. Preventing any dental issueis of course ideal but not always practical in a pocket pet that likes to roll his body into a spiky, hissing ball. If you can get lucky enough to gain access to the mouth of your spiky friend, then you might be a mealworm. No seriously, if you can get a Q-tip into your hedgie's mouth, then brush away with water and work on keeping those chompers shiny.</p><p>If brushing your hedgehog's teeth is futile, then be prepared to have a dental cleaning with possible tooth extractions performed at some point in your hedgehog's little life.</p><h2>Reproductive Diseases </h2><p>Spaying female hedgehogs are something that should be done for more than just hedgehog population control. Uterine cancers, an infected uterus called pyometra, and mammary tumors can all result from your hedgehog hanging onto her reproductive organs. These diseases can all be prevented by having an ovariohysterectomy performed on your female hedgehog at about six to eight months of age.Neutering male hedgehogs is also key to preventing testicular cancer and can also be done around the same age as the females.</p><h2>Ectoparasites </h2><p>Hedgehogs will lose some of their quills as a part of their normal shedding, but if your hedgie is itching and scratching and you are finding more quills on the bottom of the cage, then your hedgehog he may have an ectoparasite. Mites are one type of commonly seen ectoparasites on hedgehogs and will cause your hog to be itchy. Quills will fall out, the skin will dry out, and your hedgehog may be more irritable than normal. Mites can be diagnosed by your exotics vet (find one near you)by performing a skin scrape on your hedgehog and then looking for the tiny mites under a microscope. This test is not 100% fail proof though since only a small area of your hedgehog will be scraped, so your vet may decide to treat for mites even if he doesn't see any under the microscope.</p><p>Mites can be brought into your hedgie's home by way of bedding and food. Therefore, it is important to always freeze these items before putting them into the cage.</p><h2>Neurological Diseases </h2><p>Commonly referred to as ""wobbly hedgehog syndrome,"" hedgehogs can develop a neurological disease that causes them to, well - wobble. Ataxia progresses to falling over, being unable to right themselves, seizures, and eventually paralysis with many other symptoms in between. It is a sad disease that no hedgehog should ever have to go through, but reportedly affects about 1 in 10 hedgehogs. There is no known cause but a genetic predisposition is suspected, and there is no cure.</p><h2>Urinary Tract Diseases </h2><p>The bladder holds urine (tiny anatomy lesson here) that is supposed to be clear to yellow. But sometimes hedgehogs develop a urinary tract infection or cystitis, both of which can cause the urine to be brown or bloody. Urolithiasis (bladder stones) can also cause hematuria (bloody urine) and may make it difficult for your hedgehog to urinate. A urinalysis, culture, radiographs anda bladder ultrasound will all aid in diagnosing the urinary tract disease of your hedgehog. Kidney infections,bladder tumors and other diseases of the urinary systemare also seen.</p><p>Many other diseases exist and can be diagnosed by your exotics vet. Ear infections, obesity, allergies, enteritis, osteoarthritis, and other ailmentscan all occur in your hedgehog. Therefore, an annual physical examination is recommended to keep your hog as healthy as possible for as long as possible.</p>",679

These horses naturally stand out from the rest of the herd, so don't they deserve an extra-special name to reflect that, too? When you have a grey or white horse, it's natural to want to incorporate some inspiration from his color into his name, but sometimes that's easier said than done. If you need some inspiration, the below names can help you to get started. They're full of references to your white horse's coat color and you might just find the perfect name in the lists below.</p><h2>Top White Horse Names </h2> <h2>Tips for Naming Your White Horse </h2><p>While you can give your white or grey horse any great horse name, a name that references your horse's color can be particularly meaningful. A name that's inspired by the color white may seem like a natural fit, and it can also help to make it easier for other people at the barn to learn and remember your horse's name. Plus, there's something fun about choosing a name that honors your horse's appearance.</p><p>There are plenty of famous grey and white horses that you can take inspiration from, too. The mythical Pegasus was white, and legendary horses like Gem Twist, Snowman, and Milton can also give you some ideas for your horse's name.</p><p>But there are plenty of other potential ideas, too. Think about naming your horse after white foods, white flowers, and even different types of clouds.</p><p>You'll probably find it easiest to brainstorm a list of potential names. Keep a piece of paper or your smartphone by your side so that you can record a name any time inspiration strikes. Once you have a good list of names, start sorting through it to identify your favorites.</p><p>You may find that some names are a natural fit for your horse, while others might not catch on. If you're considering a name, try it out for a few days and see how it suits your horse. An ideal name will be easy to pronounce and remember, and just a couple of syllables long so that you can use it regularly while training your horse. Look for a name that doesn't sound too similar to the names of the other horses in your barn to help prevent confusion among both horses and humans.</p><p>While a barn name needs to be short and sweet, you have more room for creativity when choosing your horse's show name or registered name. Traditionally these names reference your horse's bloodlines, but you can also choose to create a unique name that doesn't tie into your horse's heritage. This is your chance to get creative. Start brainstorming favorite phrases, references to snow or the North Pole, or names that evoke or honor some of those famous grey and white horses mentioned earlier. Don't forget to choose a name that's easy to read and pronounce so that when you compete with your horse, the show announcer can correctly pronounce your horse's name when calling out your placings.</p><p>If you'll be registering your horse, be sure to look up the breed registry's naming guidelines before you settle on the perfect registered name. Most registries have strict rules dictating the number of characters a name can contain, whether you can incorporate punctuation into a name, and more. Familiarizing yourself with these rules ahead of time can help to ensure that you're able to register the name that you ultimately choose. The registry may reject a few names if horses are already registered with those names, so come up with a list of your top picks.</p><p>If you're still looking for some great ideas, read on and consider using one of these top white horse names for your horse or pony. Any of these names can work as barn names, but you can also incorporate them into a registered or show name.</p>",642
124,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-skunks-1239455,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Caring for Pet Skunks</h1>,"<h1>Caring for Pet Skunks</h1><p>Pet skunks are the kind of pet where a little research will go a long way. Vaccines, diet recommendations, and behavior of skunks should all be researched before acquiring a pet skunk and finding a veterinarian who is familiar with skunks can be very difficult. In some states, pet skunks are even illegal to keep, but if you cover all your bases before trying to care for this exotic pet you will find yourself with a rewarding new friend, and some strange looks from your neighbors.</p><h2>The Skunk </h2><p>Skunks come in many different colors, and even patterns due to cross-breeding between species. Pet skunks range from a classic black and white to a spotted lavender and white. Spotted skunks are smaller than striped skunks, weighing in at 1-3 lbs., while the striped skunks will be upwards of 14 lbs.</p><p>Skunks only breed in the spring and produce 5-6 kits. The kits are born blind and are usually ready for adoption early to mid-summer. In captivity, skunks will live about 6-10 years and obesity, heart disease, and metabolic bone disease are all commonly seen diseases.</p><h2>Domestication </h2><p>Many states in the United States allow domesticated skunks, along with the Netherlands, Italy, the U.K., Germany, and Canada. Check with your state before purchasing a skunk, and never take a skunk out of the wild to keep as a pet. Not only is it illegal, but you are putting yourself, and any exposed pets or people, at risk for contracting rabies and parasites. Several reputable skunk breeders, along with skunk rescues, are out there.</p><h2>Vaccinations </h2><p>Skunks can get rabies, therefore it is of utmost importance you acquire your skunk through a licensed breeder and not from the wild. Skunks do not have a USDA licensed rabies vaccine available so if your skunk bites someone, in many states it means the end of your skunk. Unfortunately, ending your skunk's life is the only way it can be tested for rabies. Your exotics vet may vaccinate your pet skunk with a canine or feline rabies vaccine but the effectiveness of the vaccine is unknown and states do not recognize it as a preventative measure.</p><p>Distemper vaccines are available for pet skunks but are not approved for the specific use in skunks, so be cautious with which brand is administered. Adverse reactions to certain types of vaccines have been reported, so be sure your veterinarian is aware of the appropriate distemper vaccines for skunks.</p><h2>Spaying, Neutering, and Descenting </h2><p>All skunks should be fixed and descented as soon as they are sexually mature, if not younger. This is usually done by 4-6 months of age, but descenting is often done when the kits are very young and still with the breeder. Very few veterinarians are willing and able to descent a skunk so many people end up traveling out of state to have this procedure, along with spaying and neutering, performed on their skunk.</p><h2>Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, skunks eat pretty much anything, and their diets even change seasonally. They are omnivores and cannot eat much processed food. A low-fat diet is also important because of the high risk for obesity in skunks. There are a few pre-packaged, formulated diets available for skunks but usually, they are only available online. Exotic Nutrition is one website that offers a poultry-based pellet that is meant to be complemented with fruits and vegetables. Quite the extensive list of zoos and universities use this diet.</p><p>Fresh, cooked or thawed frozen vegetables and occasional fruits, cooked poultry like chicken, and healthy foods made with grains, such as cereal, should all be fed. Nuts, cooked grains, a few pieces of dog food, and yogurt should also be mixed into the diet. Foods high in calcium and taurine supplementation should not be forgotten as well. Young kits should be fed several times a day, while adult skunks can be fed in the morning and evening.</p><p>There is much to learn about the care of pet skunks but as more and more people keep them in their homes our knowledge base will continue to grow.</p>",673

As pets, hermit crabs will also eat a lot of things, including fruits, but that doesn't mean anything goes. Knowing what fruits a pet hermit crab should eat is important in helping it live as long as possible.</p><h2>How Do Hermit Crabs Find Their Food? </h2><p>Hermit crabs are able to find theirfood in two ways: by smelling the food and by seeing other hermitcrabs eating. You can easily observe a hermit crab's senseof smell at home by placing one smelly food option and one not smelly option in it's home. Your hermit crab will most likely come out of its shell, wiggle its antennae, and then head straight to the smellier food item. This demonstrates how a hermit crab smells its food just like other animals.</p><p>Some people are surprised that hermit crabs can smell since a crab doesn't have a nose. Crabs instead have sensory receptors that are on the hairs of their antennae. When these antennae wiggle or wave around, the smell is drawn into these receptors allowing the hermit crab to smell the food.</p><h2>What to Feed Hermit Crabs </h2><p>Like humans, hermit crabs thrive on a varied diet but when feeding yourhermit crab, focus on natural and healthy food options and eliminate processed foods from their diets. You can include vegetables, meat, fish, nuts, and fresh fruit in their daily diet since hermit crabs are omnivores so this often allows you to easily feed yourhermit crab food straight from your refrigerator.</p><p>Hermit crabs will especially thrive when their diet includes foods containing calcium, carotene, and antioxidants. Formulated hermit crab food typically contains some of these things but carotenecan also befound in brightly-colored vegetables like corn and carrots, both of which are healthy additions to a hermit crab's diet. An easy way to know if your hermit crab is deficient incarotene is to look at its color after molting. If it is deficient, it's color will fadefrom abright reddish/orange color to afaded-out tan or gray after molting. Antioxidants are prevalent in many fruits and vegetables as well.</p><h2>Fruits to Feed a Hermit Crab </h2><p>Along with a quality formulated hermit crab diet, your hermit crab can and should eat, a variety of fruits.</p><h2>Offering Your Hermit Crab Food </h2><p>The size of the food doesn't really matter for hermit crabs so do not feel obligated to cut up the food into bite-sizedpieces. Your hermit crab will leisurely eat the food you have served and will take their own bites. Since hermit crabs are omnivores, they may even enjoy picking meat off the bone if you choose to offer some to your crabs. Just be sure that there is no butter or any other sauce on the meat, as this is not healthy for hermit crabs.</p><p>Food can be placed directly in the cage or in a flat bowl or plate with easy access for the hermit crab.Make sure any produce is washed and dried to remove any pesticides that might have been on the food prior to feeding.</p><h2>Offering Your Hermit Crab Water </h2><p>In addition to food, all hermit crabs need access to both fresh and saltwater. Hermit crabs need fresh water for drinking but most hermit crabs will also drink saltwater along with using it for bathing.</p><p>Two water bowls should be in your hermit crab's habitat at all times, one for fresh waterand one for saltwater.Tap water should not be used as a source of water without treating it with a dechlorinating product. Most pet stores sell dechlorinating liquid drops which remove any harmful chlorine, chloramine, and ammonia from the tap water. Once these chemicals are removed from the water it is safe for the crabs. In order to make saltwater, special salts from the pet store can be purchased. Special water to salt ratios will be provided in order to create safe saltwater for your crabs to enjoy. Table salt should never be used to make saltwater.</p>",663

She has written many books, including one on keeping rabbits, and owns Laughing Crow & Company, a farm that's home to all kinds of animals, including horses and goats.</p><p>For homesteaders interested in raising angora rabbits for wool production, the show table, 4H, or as pets, there's sure to be an angora breed to suit you. Before you decide, it's best to research all of them and talk to breeders.</p><p>It goes without saying that breeders love whatever they are raising in their rabbit barn. But if you listen to them talk about their rabbits, sometimes they will reveal a bit of information or clues that will let you know if the breed is right (or not) for you.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the five main angora breeds that are recognized by either the American Rabbit Breeders Association ( RBA) or the International Association of German Angora Rabbit Breeders (IAGARB).</p><h3>Click Play to See the 5 Popular Breeds of Angora Rabbit</h3><h2>English Angora </h2><p>The English angora weighs 5 to 7 1/2 lbs at maturity and is the smallest of the angora breeds. It's also the most popular angora for the show table because of its unique face and ear ""furnishings.""</p><p>This angora benefits from daily grooming to keep the coat free of mats and debris, as it has more wool percentage than guard hair. This means that while they are gentle with children, they aren't suitable as a child's rabbit. Coat care is simply too great. They produce 10 ounces to one pound of fiber per year.</p><h2>French Angora </h2><p>These guys weigh in at 7 1/2 to 10 1/2 lbs and are the opposite of the English as far as wool/guard hair ratio. In this case, the guard hairs make up more of the coat instead of the undercoat, making the French a better choice for novice angora owners and a dream for hand-spinners.</p><p>The extra guard hairs (where most of the color is) allows for more intense colors in the fiber. That with the wooly undercoat offers what is considered the best halo effect on a garment.</p><p>French angoras naturally molt so the coat can be harvested by plucking. This breed can produce up to one pound of wool per year.</p><h2>Satin Angora </h2><p>Satin angoras were created through a cross between a French angora and a satin rabbit. At 6 1/2 to 10 pounds, the coat has incredible shine thanks to the unique quality of the fiber scales.</p><p>The wool is dense and a pleasure to harvest. Spinners find it wonderful to work with because it's easy to spin. This breed isn't one of the bigger wool-producers, however (about 10 to 16 ounces of wool per year).</p><h2>Giant Angora </h2><p>The largest of the angora breeds, the giant weighs in at least 9 1/2 to 10 pounds and is one of the highest fiber producers in the group (from one to two pounds of wool per year). While the giant is of German descent, the giant and the German are two separate breeds.</p><p>The giant was created by breeding German angoras with other breeds such as the Flemish giant in order to make a bigger rabbit. The only color recognized by the ARBA is white. This breed doesn't ever naturally shed, so the wool must always be harvested by hand shearing.</p><h2>German Angora </h2><p>Often mistaken for the giant angora, Germans are not accepted by the ARBA but do have their own association and shows through the IAGARB. This is the breed for major fiber production.</p><p>They weigh from seven to 11 1/2 pounds and can produce an amazing 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds of wool per year. German angoras resemble the English in that they have those irresistible facial furnishings (or tassels), albeit much less of them.</p>",669
127,https://www.thesprucepets.com/gerbil-behavior-1236821,Small Pets > Gerbils,<h1>Decoding Gerbil Behavior</h1>,"<h1>Decoding Gerbil Behavior</h1><h2>What to know when keeping gerbils as pets</h2><p>Gerbils make nice pets and are fascinating to watch. But what does their interesting behavior mean?</p><h2>Interactions With Other Gerbils </h2><p>Gerbils are very social animals, and it is not a good idea to keep them singly. Pair-bonded or family units of gerbils are usually quite affectionate with each other. They will play, chasing each other around, wrestling and boxing. They will also groom one another, sleep in piles, and cuddle together. Your pet gerbils will be much happier if kept at least in pairs (same-sex unless you plan to breed, which requires a lot more care).</p><p>However, some gerbils will fight although this can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from the play wrestling or boxing commonly exhibited. Often, one animal will appear distressed and loud high-pitched squeaks may be heard, and the activity is more intense and violent than play. Gerbils who have fought severely may never be able to live together in harmony. Not unlike people, some gerbils just cannot seem to get along. This is true even for families. Young gerbils in the wild are sent off to find their territories, so family groups may begin fighting as the babies mature. If so, they need to be separated.</p><p>If you have a single gerbil, or if one of a pair dies, it can be very difficult to introduce a new gerbil, especially mature (i.e. older than eight weeks) gerbils. It is best to keep a group of similarly aged gerbils that are raised together from a young age, but if you need to introduce older gerbils, then there is a certain way to do it. Often, if you have a gerbil older than 10 weeks, it is easiest to introduce a youngster (less than 10 weeks), although older gerbils can sometimes be successfully introduced. However, sometimes certain gerbils just don't get along, so if gerbils persist in fighting it may be necessary to just keep them separated.</p><h2>Thumping </h2><p>This is something gerbils do when they are excited or stressed, as a warning to other gerbils. The thumping is produced by pounding both hind legs on the ground. Often, if one gerbil is startled and begins thumping (described as a quick ""da-dum, da-dum"" sound), others in the enclosure or room will also begin thumping. It varies in loudness and tempo, depending on the urgency or meaning, but can be quite loud considering the small creature that produces the sound. The infectious nature of the thumping means that if some activity in the home produces a rhythmic thumping or clicking type noise, the gerbils may join in.</p><p>Young gerbils may do quite a bit of thumping, but often it seems that it is just a learning activity rather than a danger warning. Thumping is also an important part of the mating ritual.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Gerbils will often groom themselves, including one another. As well as the benefits to their coats, this is an important part of their social interaction. They also appreciate being offered sand for taking a dust bath (they will roll and play in the sand, which helps clean their fur).</p><h2>Noises </h2><p>Gerbils make a high-pitched squeak but mainly as youngsters. Adults usually vocalize only when playing, excited or stressed.</p><h2>Chewing/Gnawing </h2><p>Gerbils, like most other rodents, are avid chewers and will chew their way through cage furnishings somewhat regularly. It is important to provide appropriate chewing toys, such as wood blocks and branches, to allow the gerbils to indulge this natural activity.</p><h2>Burrowing </h2><p>In the wild, gerbils live in a complex system of tunnels and burrows, so it is nice to allow the gerbils enough room to burrow in their enclosure. A deep layer of wood shavings combined with hay will provide some room for burrowing.</p><h2>Scent Marking </h2><p>Gerbils have a scent gland on their abdomen, and this is used to mark items in their territory. Gerbils that rub their stomachs on their cage furnishings are simply marking their territory.</p><p>Owning a Pet Gerbil.</p>",656
128,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ferret-proofing-your-home-1238653,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Ferret-Proofing Your Home</h1>,"<h1>Ferret-Proofing Your Home</h1><p>Ferrets are very social and need daily time out of their cages for exercise. Thorough and thoughtful ferret-proofing is an absolute necessity. When approaching ferret-proofing, remember that ferrets are very curious, will chew and swallow things, love cozy enclosed spaces, and have flexible bodies that fit through very small openings.</p><p>Ferret-proofing is an ongoing task, rather than a one-time chore. No matter how thoroughly you ferret-proof, you should still carefully supervise your pet ferrets as you never know what they might try to get into next! Keep an eye on what your ferrets want to get into, and make adjustments as necessary.</p><p>These are some general ideas to remember when ferret-proofing your home.</p><h2>Ferret-Safe Rooms </h2><p>If it is feasible, a good way to ferret proof is to have a single room that is completely and fully ferret-proofed, in which you can let your ferrets romp with the door shut to block access to the rest of your home. If this is not possible, you can ferret proof a larger area but try to block access to the kitchen, bathroom and laundry room, as these are areas that are harder to ferret-proof.</p><h2>Prevent Escapes </h2><p>Make sure your ferret cannot get outside. A ferret can easily tear through a window screen, so keep windows closed at playtime if your ferret can reach them. Ideally, make sure that when your ferrets are out, they cannot get to doors that lead to the outside. If someone inadvertently opens a door, your ferret might dart out; at the very least lock the doors when ferrets are playing. You should also check for any small openings to the outdoors (e.g. around plumbing, the dryer vent, etc) and make sure the ferret can't get out under doors. Remember, ferrets can squeeze through amazingly small spaces.</p><h2>Appliances </h2><p>Ferrets can easily fit under most appliances and can then get up into the workings of the appliance, which can be dangerous if the appliance is turned on or if the ferret finds access to electrical wires. Additionally, ferrets are very attracted to baskets of laundry, and could inadvertently be put in the washer (or dryer) with a basket of clothes. A ferret that makes his or her way into the dryer vent duct now has an escape hatch! If your ferret has access to these rooms, you must find a way to block off the undersides and backs of the appliances, and you must double-check the interiors of all appliances before using them or closing them.</p><h2>Furniture </h2><p>Furniture is another favorite of ferrets for getting under and then climbing up into the inner workings. It is a good idea to tightly staple heavier fabric to the undersides of box spring mattresses and couches and chairs, as ferrets can easily get through the flimsy fabric often used here. Recliners are very dangerous to ferrets, as the reclining mechanism can trap and severely injure a ferret hiding under the chair. Similarly, rocking chairs are a bad idea around ferrets. You also need to check couch cushions before you sit down as ferrets may burrow under or even into them. Cushions should also be checked in case the ferrets are getting into them and chewing on the foam (a danger for intestinal blockages).</p><h2>Watch What They Eat </h2><p>A common medical problem is blockages in the digestive system from something a ferret has swallowed, especially in kits. Ferrets will chew up and even swallow a surprising variety of items, but things like foam, styrofoam packing, soft rubber toys, neoprene, erasers, elastic bands, and rubber squeaky toys are among the most problematic. Indigestible items swallowed by ferrets can block the digestive system and require surgery to remove. You must also watch that your ferret does not ingest toxic substances, like cleaners, poisonous plants, medications, etc.</p><p>The following list is a good starting point for ferret proofing, but isnottotally comprehensive. You will need to watch your ferret carefully in your own home to truly identify all the ways you need to ferret-proof your home!</p>",662
129,https://www.thesprucepets.com/wet-tail-in-hamsters-1238910,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Wet Tail in Hamsters</h1>,"<h1>Wet Tail in Hamsters</h1><p>Arguably the most commonly seen illness in hamsters, wet tail can be a serious and fatal condition if not treated immediately.</p><h2>What Is Wet Tail? </h2><p>The term ""wet tail"" refers to just that a wet tail, on your pet hamster. This wet tail is basically diarrhea, or loose stools, and is known as proliferative ileitis or regional enteritis. The diarrhea is thought to be caused by an overgrowth of intestinal bacteria.</p><h2>How Does a Hamster Get Wet Tail? </h2><p>Stress is usually the main culprit of wet tail. Young hamsters get moved from a breeder or vendor to a pet store, to a new home, and sometimes get returned to the store after that, all within a period of a few weeks. This would stress anyone out especially a tiny baby hamster. This stress causes the bacteria to overpopulate in the gut, which in turn causes diarrhea.</p><p>Wet tail is also extremely contagious. Therefore if your new hamster was kept in a large cage with other hamsters that had wet tail, your hamster and/or the other hamsters could get wet tail too. When picking out a hamster to take home, make sure it is active and running around to decrease the likelihood of it having wet tail already.</p><h2>How to Treat Wet Tail? </h2><p>In order to treat wet tail, you need to know your hamster has wet tailand not diarrhea from another cause. Remember, since wet tail is a bacterial issue and causes diarrhea, your hamster can have diarrhea for reasons other than having the wet tail disease. For example, your hamster may eat some fresh fruit or veggies that have high water contents and suddenly he has diarrhea. This diarrhea is most likely not from wet tail, but from all the extra water content he took in. An exotics vet is the best place to start if you aren't sure what caused diarrhea.</p><p>If he does, in fact, have wet tail, your exotics vet will probably prescribe antibiotics that are safe for hamsters and may give him some subcutaneous fluids to rehydrate him. You might even have to syringe feed him special hamster food (such as Oxbow Critical Care or Emeraid) or vegetable baby food if he is not eating.</p><p>If you are unable to take your hamster to an exotics vet, you can try giving it wet tail drops at home. These drops are orange flavored and have an antibiotic in them. They can be purchased without seeing a veterinarian and can be put in a water bottle or directly in the hamster's mouth. If your hamster does not improve on these drops in a couple of days, be sure to get it in to see a vet. Exotics decline in health very quickly and time wasted could mean a fatal outcome for your hamster.</p><h2>How to Prevent Wet Tail? </h2><p>Some exotics vets may recommend treating your hamster with wet tail drops preventatively when you take home your new hamster. This can be done by mixing the appropriate amount of wet tail drops into your hamster's water bottle.</p><p>When choosing a hamster from a pet store, make sure it is active, that its eyes are open, and that its rear end is dry and free of fecal matter. To play it even safer, don't take home a hamster that is living with another hamster that doesn't look too healthy (i.e., eyes closed, sitting in the corner, wet bottom).</p><p>If you have more than one hamster and one comes down with wet tail, separate them immediately and be sure you wash your hands after handling the sick one and before handling the healthy one.</p><p>Once you get your hamster, it is recommended to get a wellness examination by a veterinarian within the first month of having your animal to check if it is healthy and doing well. This can help find signs of dehydration, diarrhea, and any other concerns you may have for your new pet. This is also a great time to discuss any other concerns you may have for your new pet.</p>",665
130,https://www.thesprucepets.com/releasing-exotic-pets-in-the-wild-1237278,Small Pets > Exotic Pets,<h1>Releasing Exotic Pets in the Wild</h1>,"<h1>Releasing Exotic Pets in the Wild</h1><p>When animals kept as exotic pets show up in the wild it is usually difficult to know whether the animal escaped or was purposely released. Of course, owners should be taking precautions to make sure their pets do not escape but some people believe that when their exotic pets get too difficult to manage that it is okay to release them into the wild. The reasons for choosing to release them into the wild are endless. Perhaps they couldn't find another home for the pet or a shelter wouldn't take them. Regardless of the reasons given, no pet should be released into the wild.</p><h2>Exotic Pets Can't Survive in the Wild </h2><p>The harsh reality is that the vast majority of released pets will die when left to fend for themselves outside. Some will die quickly, possibly after getting hit by a vehicle or running into a predator, and others will die a long, slow death by starvation. Either way, it is extremely cruel to abandon a pet in the wild. Captive bred animals do not have the skills needed to survive in the wild and even those that were originally wild-caught still have a difficult time adapting to a new environment where their usual food is not available or the conditions may not be suitable for their species.</p><p>Life in the wild is no picnic, especially for animals that are used to free food and shelter. Of course, some animals become the exceptions to the usual scenario but there still isn't typically a happy ending.</p><h2>Released Exotic Pets Destroy the Ecosystem </h2><p>Given the right animals in the right ecosystem, released exotic pets may find success and colonize in the wild. This is often an ecological or agricultural disaster. There are numerous examples of invasive species when an introduced plant or animal has become established to the extent where it ""takes over"" an ecosystem and diminishes native populations. Invasive species can cause problems by preying on native plants and animals, competing for limited resources, or by introducing parasites and diseases not normally found in the area.</p><p>Not all instances of invasive species can be attributed to the pet trade but there are a few environments where released animals have become established and caused damage. Red-eared sliders are quite adaptable at colonizing lakes or ponds and they often thrive at the expense of other species. Parakeets have successfully colonized some areas to the detriment of native species and agriculture. </p><p>Giant African Land Snails are considered a huge risk of becoming an invasive species due to their voracious appetites and amazing reproductive rates. Warmer climates are often more hospitable reptile invaders andiguanas and Burmese pythonshave established huge populations in Florida. Iguanas are doing a fair amount of damage to the local vegetation as well as becoming a general nuisance and Burmese pythons are feeding on local wildlife and becoming a major concern in the Everglades. Another example of invasive reptiles is with chameleons in Hawaii.</p><h2>They Can Become a Neighborhood Nuisance </h2><p>We've all heard stories of snakes lurking in the plumbing or alligators in the sewers of large cities and while many of these are urban legends the scenarios are not that far-fetched. It is not uncommon for snakes that have been released into the wild to survive for some time in a warm climate since they can easily find a hiding spot and don't eat very often.</p><p>Every so often news stories appears about constrictors being spotted in unlikely neighborhoods and often suspected in the disappearances of neighborhood pets. Some snakes are large enough to pose a risk to people, especially children. Other exotic animals such as non-domestic cats like lions and Savannah cats are also troublesome since they could pose a risk to not only other pets but to humans as well.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not exotic pets released into the wild are a danger, a nuisance, or a threat to the ecosystem, releasing your exotic pet into the wild is terribly irresponsible. Just don't do it.</p>",665
131,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-an-exotic-pet-5525223,Small Pets > Exotic Pets,<h1>What Is an Exotic Pet?</h1>,"<h1>What Is an Exotic Pet?</h1> <p>What is considered to be an exotic pet depends on context, but it is largely agreed upon that anything other than a domestic animal can be considered exotic. Different companies, people, state governments, and associations may all define what an exotic pet is slightly differently than one another. To some, a pet goat or a ferret is exotic but to others, only things like tigers and venomous snakes are exotic. What is ordinary for some people is not always ordinary for another. Within the veterinary community, exotic pets are typically considered anything that isn't a domestic dog, cat, or farm animal.</p><h2>Legality of Exotic Pets </h2><p>Since each state has its own laws and regulations on exotic pet ownership, each state also defines what an exotic pet is differently. This means that some states may deem it illegal to own certain types of exotic pets while others may allow you to care for any kind of animal as a pet. Most states make it illegal to own exotic pets that they consider to be invasive or dangerous to the environment or people, but some have other reasons for outlawing certain kinds of pets. If you are unsure whether or not a specific type of animal is legal to own where you live, be sure to check your state laws before acquiring the pet.  </p><h2>What Animals are Classified as Exotic? </h2><p>In general, animals that are not domesticated are usually classified as being exotic. This includes birds, fish, reptiles, invertebrates, and many pocket pets that are commonly purchased from pet stores. Dogs, cats, chickens, cows, horses, goats, pigs, and other animals that are domesticated are not usually classified as exotic pets. However, rabbits may or may not be considered exotic. Exotic pets may also include some wild animals, both native and foreign species, that people choose to own and care for.</p><h2>Are Exotic Pets Dangerous? </h2><p>Some people are under the false impression that all exotic pets are dangerous wild animals but this is not the case. Many common exotic pets, like rabbits, guinea pigs, and chinchillas, are also referred to as exotic companion animals because they can make wonderful pets. Plenty of children have cared for exotic pets like hamsters and goldfish while their parents may have even been unaware of this classification of animal. Despite this, some exotic pets are indeed dangerous wild animals and can be very harmful to people, the environment, or both. Giant African land snails are a good example of a type of exotic pet that is dangerous to both people (due to the types of diseases they can spread) and the environment and are therefore illegal to own in the United States. Many state laws are designed to protect people and the environment from being harmed by these types of exotic animals. Domestic dogs and cats have the potential to bite or scratch people just like some exotic animals. However, since they are not wild animals, they lack the wild instincts of some exotic animals that can result in injuries to humans. </p><h2>Do Vets Treat Exotic Pets? </h2><p>Yes, some veterinarians do elect to treat exotic pets, but not all of them do. Whether or not a veterinarian treats exotic pets will depend on their own comfort level and training. Because of this, it is important for anyone interested in owning an animal that may be classified as exotic to confirm what veterinarians near them are willing to treat their desired type of exotic pet.</p><p>Veterinary specialties exist in zoo, exotic companion mammal, avian, and reptile medicine. This means that veterinarians and veterinary technicians that earn their specializations in one or more of these topics have proven their advanced knowledge and training in these specific species. These professionals are often exotic pet owners' best options when they are looking for a veterinarian, but there are unfortunately not many veterinary professionals who are specialized in these topics.</p>",647

Also, if you take home two mice who were incorrectly sexed, you may be surprised by a litter. Not to worry, though, as the new mom mouse will likely cope fine, with a little help from you!</p><h2>What to Do When Your Mouse Has Babies </h2><p>A mouse that has given birth should be disturbed as little as possible or she may become agitated and abandon or neglect the babies. This means other than providing food and water, you should leave the mice and their cage alone as much as possible for the first couple of weeks. While it is tempting to look at the babies and make sure everything is okay, it is best to leave the mom to do her thing.</p><p>Place strips of toilet paper or facial tissue in the cage so mom can build a soft nest. Ideally, you would do this once you realize your mouse is pregnant (it is usually pretty obvious by a couple of days before birth, simply by the sheer size of her belly).</p><p>If you realize your mouse is pregnant, do a thorough cleaning to prepare for the new arrivals. However, once the babies are born, don't clean the cage for a while. Leave it alone for the first 10 to 14 days (you can spot clean really wet spots if absolutely necessary, but avoid disturbing the nest).</p><p>Make sure to provide plenty of food and freshwater, but make feeding and watering as efficient and calm as possible.</p><p>While it is okay to have a quick peek in the cage on occasion, avoid sitting and watching for long periods.</p><p>Keep in mind that the mom will be very protective andmay act more aggressive than usual; this is natural and no cause for concern.</p><p>Though interference should be avoided if at all possible if for some rare reason you must move a baby, use a spoon so you do not get your scent on the baby. It is rarely necessary to move a baby though even if they are out of the nest; the mom will usually retrieve any stray pups and return them to the nest.</p><h2>Caring for the Litter </h2><p>If you have other female mice in the cage, it may be fine to leave them in the cage, as they will often help care for a litter. However, sometimes another female will try to take over a litter or cause other interference, so make sure other females are helping and not hindering the new mom. If you have a male mouse, though, now is the time to move him out, both to prevent both another pregnancy (which can happen shortly after birth) and to make sure he doesn't interfere with mom raising the litter (which is uncommon but possible).</p><p>The baby mice will be ready for weaning at about 3 weeks of age, and it is best to separate the male pups into one group and the females into another at this point.</p><p>Make sure you are feeding a high-quality diet with lots of protein. In addition to a good-quality diet, you can offer small amounts of hard-boiled egg, bits of cooked chicken, cheese, wheat germ or dog biscuits to give the mom a nutritional boost.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you got a pregnant mouse from the pet store she may be quite young and may not have the best mothering abilities. She may be more likely to abandon or even cannibalize her babies. If she doesn't care for them and they are less than 10 days of age, it is extremely difficult to save the babies. Don't try to handle the babies at all for at least two weeks. It is best to make sure you get your mouse from a store that separates males from females at a young age to avoid surprises like this.</p>",663

Hedgehog tooth diseases are real and shouldn't be ignored. They can cause serious pain and infections to your hedgehog, and if you have ever had a toothache, you know it's no fun!</p><h2>Dental Care </h2><p>Hedgehogs can have up to 44 tiny teeth. They have incisors, premolars, molars, and canine teeth just like us. They get these teeth when they are just 3 weeks old, whichmeans they have them almost their entire lives to allow them to chew and grab their food. Most hedgehog owners don't brush their hedgie's teeth, but this doesn't mean the teeth can't be cleaned professionally by your exotic pet veterinarian or that issues won't arise with their teeth.</p><p>To get hedgehog teethprofessionally cleaned, your hedgehog will need to be put under anesthesia. It is then that those little teeth can be cleaned, polished, and x-rayed. Problem teeth may need to be extracted. This is the same procedure that is done on cats, dogs, and other pets with teeth, but there is still anesthetic risk involved anytime your pet goes under anesthesia. Blood screening and IV fluids should be discussed prior to the procedure with your veterinarian to assure the safest dental prophylaxis possible.</p><h2>Brushing at Home </h2><p>If you do want to try brushing teeth do not use toothpaste. Try using a wet Q-tip and gently rub all of the teeth with the Q-tip. Focus primarily on the back molars and on the side of the teeth that you can see. Don't stress out your hedgehog and do be gentle. If the gums start to bleed a little, don't panic! This just means they are not used to being brushed and may not be very healthy.</p><p>If you see a large amount of blood or are able to see any of the tooth roots, get your hedgehog in to see the veterinarian. If there is a lot of tartar built up brown or black coloration on the teeth, you won't be able to get it off with brushing. Your fingernail may be able to gently scrape it off the tooth, although hedgehogs don't typically allow this. Otherwise, a professional cleaning with an ultrasonic scaler is your only other option.</p><h2>Dental Problems </h2><p>Plaque, tartar, and calculus are what your veterinarian might call the black or brown stuff on your hedgie's teeth. It is made up of saliva, food particles, and bacteria. It is a problem because it makes the teeth unhealthy and sits on the gum line. The gum line is a direct pathwayto your hedgehog's blood supply which therefore allows the bacteria to go to all the major organs in the body.</p><p>A large accumulation of one of these three things can lead to a systemic infection in your hedgehog. You can usually brush off the softer plaque, but usually, tartar and calculus are too hard to brush off without a professional cleaning.</p><h2>Tooth Root Abscesses </h2><p>Hedgehogs may also experience tooth fractures and dental abscesses. A tooth root abscess is when the root of the tooth, which you cannot see without x-rays on a healthy tooth, has a pocket of pus surrounding it in your hedgehog's mouth. This is due to a bad tooth infection and may sometimes cause a bump under your hedgehog's eye on the side of the face where the bad tooth is.</p><p>This bump may look like a zit and may pop up pretty quickly. If you see a bump like this, or any lump on your hedgehog, get them to see the veterinarian as soon as possible. The bad tooth will need to be extracted, the rest of the teeth cleaned, and your little hedgehog needs some serious pain medications and antibiotics.</p>",656

Most people think that you can just get a guinea pig, some pellet food, a cage and you are done. However, that is not the case. A guinea pig requires hay in its diet and vitamin C to survive. Always provide it.</p><p>Likewise, there are two pet products that are very common toys for other small mammals and rodents that you should buy your guinea pig. An exercise ball or running wheel are downright dangerous for guinea pigs.</p><h2>Always Have Hay Available </h2><p>If you're not experienced with guinea pigs, you might think that a pellet labeled as a complete diet is all your new little piggy needs. Unfortunately, if you only feed pellets, then you are leaving out a critical part of your pet's diet.</p><p>All adult guinea pigs need an unlimited amount of good quality timothy hay. Not only is the hay a food, but it also makes your pet chew much more than simply eating pellets can accomplish. Hay wears down your animal's constantly growing teeth and helps prevent dental problems.</p><p>If you have a pregnant, nursing guinea pig, ill older guinea pig, or a baby under 6 months old, you will want to feed alfalfa hay. Give all other piggies timothy hay since alfalfa is too rich in calcium and can cause health problems.</p><p>You do not need to buy a fancy type of timothy hay with herbs, dried fruit, or vegetables added. Those additions are on a par with human junk food. They have little if any nutritional value and the fruit is high in sugar. Get fresh, plain, good quality hay and feed your guinea pig vitamin-rich fresh vegetables separately.</p><p>Timothy hay also gives you many opportunities to enrich your guinea pig, and you can feed it in a variety of ways. Try stuffing it into cardboard tubes saved from toilet paper rolls or fill up a small paper bag. Or clear a spot in the cages and let each of guinea pig have a pile of hay in which to play.</p><p>You can also try a hay ball, but take off the roller frame that comes with it because that can be dangerous for piggies.</p><p>Guinea pigs, like humans, cannot manufacture vitamin C. Choose a pellet enriched with this important vitamin, and check the date on the bag to make sure the food is fresh. Vitamin C degrades quickly, so your guinea pig's main source should come from fresh vegetables and fruits provided daily. Additionally, vitamin C tablets are great ways to increase vitamin C intake on a daily basis. Otherwise, your pet risks developing scurvy.</p><h2>Never Use Exercise Balls and Wheels </h2><p>Movies like ""G-Force"" feature guinea pigs in exercise balls and running wheels. This may look cute, but it is terribly misleading. Exercise balls and wheels are deadly for guinea pigs.</p><p>These activities may be appropriate for some pocket pets like rats, mice, gerbils, and hamsters, but they should never be used for guinea pigs. Even if the product says on the package that it is designed for guinea pigs, do not believe the marketing.</p><p>Guinea pigs have a different anatomy, and they can badly injure their backs with an exercise ball or wheel. Also, exercise balls are also too enclosed and do not provide enough air circulation which can lead to heat stroke. This condition is often fatal for guinea pigs.</p><p>If you want your guinea pig to safely get enough exercise, buy the largest possible cage and give your pet floor time in a safe area. Or provide exercise in a X-pen setup so they can safely roam around.</p><p>Lap time is also an important part of a guinea pig's day. Although not all piggies are cuddly, many love time out of their cage to sit on their owners' laps. Always hold your guinea pig in a towel to protect yourself from potty accidents.</p>",660
135,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hamster-toys-1238921,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Pet Hamster Toys</h1>,"<h1>Pet Hamster Toys</h1><p>Hamsters, both dwarf and Syrian, are active creatures. They need a variety of toys and other items to provide them with opportunities for exercise, exploration, and play. While they do appreciate time outside of the cage to explore in a hamster-safe environment, there are many things you can place inside the cage to provide exercise.</p><h2>Hamster Wheels and Balls </h2><p>Most hamsters make great use of a hamster wheel and your hamster's cage should have one. It is important to make sure the wheel is the proper size and try to get a solid surface wheel to cut down on the risk of injuries. Run-Abouts are the clear plastic balls (several styles are available) in which you put your hamster in and let them run around on the floor without the worry of them getting away from you. Both wheels and Run-Abouts are great ways to make sure your hamster gets enough exercise.</p><h2>Chew Toys for Hamsters </h2><p>Hamsters need a good supply of items and toys that they can gnaw on to keep their constantly growing teeth in good condition.Wooden pet chew toys are an ideal choice. Wood items not purchased from the pet store (stay away from cedar or other evergreen type woods) should be pesticide- and chemical-free. If you are unsure if a type of wood is safe it is probably best to stick with items made for pets. Pesticide-free fruit tree branches from your backyard or hardwood blocks or shapes that are not chemically treated are okay for your hamster.Willow balls, rings, and tunnels are also marketed for rabbits but and the smaller sized options are great for hamsters.</p><p>In addition to wood chews, cardboard can be provided for chewing (and hiding). Hamsters also love cardboard tubes from paper towel and toilet paper rolls and there are now commercial tubes that are a bit sturdier and are said to be safe for chewing (e.g. Totally Chewbular Play Tubes).</p><h2>Climbing and Housing Options for Hamsters </h2><p>There are a variety of climbers and houses/huts designed for hamsters and other small rodents. Wood ladders and climbing blocks are great for hamsters. If you can't find wood ladders in the hamster section of your pet store, check the bird section.</p><p>You can also use hardwood dowels and wood to make ramps and climbing structures. Coconut shells can also be used to create huts and houses. Organic ropes (hemp, sisal, and cotton) can also be used to construct hanging toys, walkways, and bridges in the hamster cage. Extreme caution is required with hanging toys and ropes use thicker sizes of rope and be sure your hamster (head, body, legs, or toenails) cannot get entangled in any ropes used to hang items or use them only under close supervision.</p><h2>Plastic Toys for Hamsters </h2><p>Caution is needed when it comes to plastic. Most hamsters love plastic tunnels and tubes and other play structures but chewing them can lead to problems. Some plastic toys will be destroyed very quickly and if your hamster is swallowing plastic pieces from chewing it is a big concern. When you offer plastic items keep a close eye on them and if your hamster is chewing too much discard the item.</p><h2>Sand and Digging Options for Hamsters </h2><p>You can provide a dish of chinchilla dust bath or fine sand, in which your hamster may roll to keep its coat in good condition. Also, most hamsters love to dig so providing a deeper box of sand or sterilized soil big enough for the hamster to burrow in is a great treat for hamsters.</p><h2>Mineral Blocks and Pumice Stones for Hamsters </h2><p>Mineral blocks and pumice stones are not necessary. If your hamster does gnaw on them it can help keep their teeth in good condition but they are very hard and many hamsters won't use them. A variety of natural wood chew items is a better option (and necessary minerals should be provided via the diet).</p>",646
136,https://www.thesprucepets.com/grooming-pet-rabbits-1237197,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>Rabbit Grooming</h1>,"<h1>Rabbit Grooming</h1><p>Rabbits spend a good deal of time grooming themselves but that doesn't mean we don't have to lend a helping hand once in a while. Rabbits usually do not need baths but regular brushing helps keep their coat in good condition and helps prevent hairballs and nail trims help keep your rabbit's feet healthy and from getting stuck in carpeting. A little grooming goes a long way.</p><h2>Brushing Rabbits </h2><p>If you have a short-haired breed of rabbit,it is a good idea to brush them at least once a week. When they are shedding they usually shed about every three months more frequent brushing is recommended. During the heavy part of their shed, daily brushing is ideal and you will notice a huge difference in the amount of hair you brush out if you can do this. Keep in mind that rabbit skin is quite fragile, so be gentle and use a brush designed for rabbits if possible (bristle brushes are preferable as metal toothed slicker brushes may hurt their skin). A fine-toothed comb can also be used. Following up with a rubber grooming toolcan help clean up the loose hair too, or try running a damp (not wet) washcloth over the coat after brushing to catch any remaining loose hairs.</p><p>If you have an angora rabbit, grooming must be a daily ritual. Unless you are showing your long-haired rabbit, it is easiest to keep the coat trimmed to a length of about 1 inch or else the coat will be very prone to matting (but always be careful about trimming the hair over a rabbit's hocks or sores may result due to the lack of padding). Your rabbit is also very prone to developing hairballs that can cause a blockage in their stomach (""wool block"") if they ingest these long hairs. You can trim your rabbit's hair yourself or get a groomer to do the first cut and then do the maintenance trims at home. You must be very careful about trimming hair though since rabbit skin is very thin and easy to accidentally cut. As with all rabbits, daily brushing should become part of the routine from a young age (it is also a good opportunity to bond with your rabbit).</p><h2>Removing Matted Hair from Rabbits </h2><p>If your rabbit develops mats in their coat never try to trim them out with scissors as it is very easy to accidentally cut into the skin. Gradually work out the mat by gently separating and combing hair out of the mat a tiny bit at a time while being careful not to pull on the skin. It may take several grooming sessions to work out a mat. Alternatively, you can take your rabbit to a groomer to have the mats trimmed out with electric clippers but these can also cut the skin so care must be taken regardless of the method used.</p><h2>Do You Need to Bathe Your Rabbit? </h2><p>Rabbits do not need baths and generally find them very stressful. If a bath is necessary it is better to do a ""spot cleaning"" of the area that is dirty rather than subjecting a rabbit to the stress of bathing. Keep in mind when you do need to get your rabbit wet that it takes a long time for rabbit fur to dry and using a blow dryer must be done with extreme caution to speed the process. Rabbits are very prone to overheating so use a warm or cool setting on the dryer if it must be used.</p><h2>Rabbit Nail Trims</h2><p>Regular nail trims should also be part of your rabbit's grooming routine. Check their nails once a week when brushing them and trim them whenever they get a bit long. Frequent trims are better than having to trim a large amount off even if you are only trimming off a sliver. Always have styptic powder ready and a friend to help you hold your rabbit.</p>",651

But have youa cow, pig or chick lately? They're pretty darn cute, too.</p><p>Most people have only seen farm animals at the petting zoo or a county fair, so they don't know how cute, silly, goofy, ridiculous or weird barnyard animals really are. Read on to learnall the things you were never toldabout the cutest (and most fascinating) farm animals.</p><h2>Goats </h2><p>Goats are probably the biggest weirdos you'll come across in the barnyard. Why? They love to climb on top of things; they scream like humans (which is really called ""bleating); and, most interestingly, goats have.</p><p>That's right. Previously, researchersbelieved only mammals with larger brains, like humans, elephants, and dolphins, could have unique accents. Turns out, goats are just as vocally versatile.Plus, goats' accents can change as they move between different groups of goats.</p><h2>Cows </h2><p>Cows areadorable creatures. And, of course, they shoulder the burden of generating the world's ice cream supply. Thank you, cows.</p><p>So, how do we get these bovine beauties to give us even moreice cream? Their farmers simply need to give them names. Research has shown that if a farmer has a better relationship with her cows particularly if she names them and shows affection they'll produce more milk.</p><h2>Pigs </h2><p>Pigs aren't all just looks, with their cute little noses and curly tails they're basically barnyard geniusestoo. In fact, some pigs are probably smarter than yourhumantoddler and definitelysmarter than your dog. Pigs, toddlers,and dogs probably all have comparable table manners though.</p><p>Some research has shown that pigs have such high cognitive function they can recognize their names and mother's voices immediately after birth, remember where they've hidden food,and play joystick-controlled video games.</p><h2>Chickens </h2><p>We admit it chickens are not the cutest animals at first glance. But if you spend enough time with them, you'll see that they're so weird looking it's pretty endearing. Plus, they love to cuddle andsunbathewith their chicken pals. Adorable, right?</p><p>But in the case of chickens, brains trump beauty: They're able to distinguish between more than 100 faces of other chickens. When was the last time you were able to accurately identify a distance relative?</p><h2>Llamas </h2><p>Llamas basically look like stuffed animals, but don't let their fluffy faces fool you: If you intrude on their territory, they won't be happy. Many farmers use llamas to protect their livestock because they're extremely alert and aren't afraid to chase an intruder away.</p><p>It may be worth getting chased by something so cuddly and goofy looking though.</p><h2>Horses </h2><p>Watch a horse gallop across a fieldwhilethe sun is setting andnot to shed a tear. Just imagining it is probably getting you choked up.</p><p>Horses are freaking beautiful, majestic animals,and they're super expressive, too. They use vocalizations, like whinnying, neighing or snorting, as well as their eyes, ears, and nostrils to express their moods and feelings.</p><h2>Donkeys </h2><p>Horses get all the majesty and grandeur of the family Equidae (or the horse family), but donkeys are pretty dang cute, too. Plus, they're like a wise, all-knowing mom.</p><p>How? Not only can donkeys remember a place or another donkey (or something you did as a dumb teenager) from as long ago asa whopping 25 years, but donkeys alsowon't participate in activities if they seem unsafe.</p><h2>Sheep </h2><p>Everyone loves sheep for their warm wool and their heroic deeds in the movie. Their goofy, blank stares are also pretty endearing, but if you look closely into sheep's eyes, you'll see they're not as creepy as they seem!</p><p>They have horizontal pupils, which offer them some protection from predators. How? They can see all around themselves not just what's in front of them which is necessary for an animal whose only defense mechanisms are-ing and running away.</p>",635
138,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ferret-lymphoma-1238680,Small Pets > Ferrets,<h1>Ferret Lymphoma</h1>,"<h1>Ferret Lymphoma</h1><h2>Cancer and Pet Ferrets</h2><p>Ferret lymphoma (also referred to as lymphosarcoma) is an awful kind of cancer that is commonly seen in pet ferrets. It affects any and all lymphoid tissue and can spread throughout the entire body. It can also be difficult to diagnose and unfortunately, no cures currently exist.</p><h2>What Is Lymphoma? </h2><p>Lymphoma in ferrets is the same thing as it is in dogs, cats, and other animals. It is cancer that affects lymphoid tissue and depending on the area it is affecting, it is classified as multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, cutaneous and extranodal. It is also classified as either low grade or high.</p><p>Multicentric lymphoma is when the lymph nodes are affected and they are usually obviously enlarged. The liver, spleen and bone marrow may also be affected. Mediastinal lymphoma affects the lymph nodes in the thorax (chest) and may also affect the thymus gland. Gastrointestinal lymphoma, as the name implies, is found in the stomach and intestinal tract and may also affect other organs. Extranodal lymphoma can affect the skin, eye, heart, kidneys, or central nervous system.</p><h2>Symptoms of Lymphoma </h2><p>Since lymphoma can be found almost anywhere in your ferret's body it can be hard to diagnose. Your ferret might present with weakness, diarrhea, lethargy, vomiting, bloody stools, enlarged lymph nodes, itchy and inflamed areas of the skin, or even bleeding within an eye. With so many possible symptoms in so many different areas of the body, the disease is often treated symptomatically before a confirmed diagnosis is made.</p><p>Bloodwork or cytology and biopsies of obviously affected areas of skin or visible lymph nodes will aid in a positive diagnosis. Increased calcium and low albumin levels in the bloodwork may reveal lymphoma, along with tumors identified through radiographs or ultrasounds. Often times a ferret is chronically ill and elective surgery is performed to explore the abdomen for possible abnormalities. This surgery usually finds some sort of lymphoma and/or other common ferret diseases such as adrenal disease or an insulinoma.</p><p>If a biopsy of an affected lymph node is taken and is found to be positive for lymphoma, it will be assigned one of five stages. Stage five is the worst stage where the bone marrow or blood is involved in the disease process.</p><h2>Treating Lymphoma in Ferrets </h2><p>Curing lymphoma is unfortunately not very likely. While chemotherapy is available, it usually only buys you a very limited amount of extra time. Oral steroids, such as prednisolone, are administered to help with the size of the tumors and typically some improvement is noted short term, but overall a very poor long-term prognosis (outcome) is expected.</p><p>Treating lymphoma with steroids and symptomatically if your ferret has diarrhea, vomits, or a skin infection, are usually the options most ferret owners take. But intravenous (IV) chemotherapy drugs are available to the owner who wants to do all they can for their ferret.</p><h2>Causes of Lymphoma </h2><p>Lymphoma seems to be seen more and more often in vet clinics lately. While no one knows for sure what causes the many kinds of lymphoma, some are recently speculating it has something to do with a virus. Lymphoma has even been given from an infected ferret to a previously non-infected ferret with ""cell-free extracts"" in a laboratory but to date, no genes have been isolated, therefore we don't know exactly what causes it.</p><p>As of now, there is nothing you can effectively do to limit the chances that your pet ferret will get lymphoma. But hopefully, one day that will change.</p><p>If your ferret has any symptoms of lymphoma, such as diarrhea, lethargy, or weight loss, or you suspect he has another common ferret disease make sure you get him checked out by your exotics vet as soon as possible.</p>",645
139,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hamster-teeth-1238909,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Problems With Hamsters' Teeth</h1>,"<h1>Problems With Hamsters' Teeth</h1><p>Not all exotics have problems with their teeth, but hamster teeth can cause problems. Hamsters, like some other exotic pets, have the type of teeth that grow continuously throughout their lives. These teeth may periodically require tooth trims if your hamster doesn't wear them down himself.</p><h2>Hypsodont Dentition </h2><p>Herbivores such as rabbits, and omnivores like chinchillas and hamsters, have long teeth that continuously grow, often requiring tooth trims. These teeth are called hypsodontal teeth. Hypsodont teeth have crowns (the part of the teeth you can see) that extend a great length beyond the gums. Therefore hypsodontal teeth are unusually long when compared to the teeth of dogs, cats, or humans. The natural grinding action of chewing on toys, hay, and other food items, causes the teeth to stay at an ideal length in normal herbivores, but many need to have their teeth manually cut regularly due to several health and genetic factors.</p><h2>Overgrown Teeth </h2><p>The incisors, or front teeth, of your hamster, are the easiest to identify when they become overgrown. They will usually grow so long that they begin to curve and stick out between the lips. Once they get too long they can become stuck on things, or worse yet, grow into the gums or roof of your hamster's mouth. The molars, or teeth in the back of the mouth, can also reach excessive lengths, but in hamsters they rarely become overgrown. Molars are difficult to observe without the use of a speculum to look in the back of the mouth, but hamsters with overgrown molars will commonly hypersalivate and have difficulty chewing and swallowing.</p><h2>Incisor Tooth Trims </h2><p>If done correctly, tooth trims are not painful. Since hamster mouths are so small, a Dremel tool is not safe to use as it is for larger herbivores such as rabbits and chinchillas. A pair of suture scissors or small nail clippers work to clip the overgrown incisors. Care should be taken not to clip the teeth too short which will cause pain and possible trauma to the teeth. Many exotic pet hospitals will perform these tooth trims inexpensively with a technician or a doctor.</p><h2>Molar Tooth Trims </h2><p>Trimming molars can be more difficult than trimming incisors and thankfully doesn't need to be done very often or at all. Molars are not as easily identified as being overgrown, so the pet is usually already being seen by a veterinarian by this point. After the veterinarian confirms that your hamster's molars are too long, they may be able to trim them with the pet awake using a surgical instrument designed for bone or tooth removal called a rongeur (interestingly enough, the word ""rongeur"" is French for ""rodent"") or a tooth-specific instrument. If your hamster allows them (although they typically don't), and the veterinarian can grasp the correct tooth, the overgrown portion is simply snipped off. There is a possibility for trauma, but unlike dog nail clippers, rongeurs are much sharper and don't usually cause any damage. If the trimming is too complex or the pet is too fractious (which is probably going to be the case for your hamster), anesthesia or sedation can be administered to perform the trim. With your hamster temporarily incapacitated, the molars can be trimmed and filed down to an appropriate length. This is the ideal method of trimming molars, but some owners may have financial constraints that restrict them from anesthetizing or sedating their exotic pets.</p><p>Owners of hamsters and other exotic pets with hypsodontal teeth must be aware of the possible complications regarding their pet's teeth. Without proper attention, overgrown teeth can cause serious trauma, anorexia, and even death from the inability to chew and swallow. Thankfully the problem of overgrown teeth is easily controlled with regular tooth trims and proper chewing behaviors. But if you need help with your hamster's teeth, give your local exotics vet a call.</p>",647
140,https://www.thesprucepets.com/exotic-pets-that-eat-hay-1238777,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Exotic Pets That Eat Hay</h1>,"<h1>Exotic Pets That Eat Hay</h1><h2>Not to Be Confused With Straw</h2><p>Animals of all sorts eat hay. Timothy, sweet grass, alfalfa you name it, and there's an animal that eats it. But don't confuse it with straw!</p><h2>Rabbits </h2><p>While they are young, rabbits need to consume alfalfa and other legume hay for the nutrients, calories, and other benefits it provides to their teeth and digestive tract. But as they get older (about six months of age) you'll switch them over to a grass hay to make sure they get the continued nutrition they need. An adult rabbit should get a pile of hay the size of their body on a daily basis. That's a lot of hay!</p><h2>Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Just like rabbits, guinea pigs require a good amount of hay every day. Guinea pig diets need to include a couple of tablespoons of vitamin C enriched pellets and all the hay they want.</p><h2>Chinchillas </h2><p>Some chinchillas can be really picky about their food, and you'll need to find a hay they enjoy. Whether it's Timothy, sweet grass, or another fancy cut of hay, give your chinchilla some options if he's being selective, because he needs that stuff! Hay is important for the digestive tract and the regular gnawing action of the teeth to keep them trimmed naturally.</p><h2>Tortoises and Turtles </h2><p>Some species of turtles and tortoises need piles of hay each day. The larger the turtle, the larger the pile of hay will be. Full-grown sulcattas will eat such large portions of grass hays that it will probably be more cost-effective to purchase it from a nearby horse stable or farm supply store than a pet store. Small or young turtles will need some help with their hay and you'll need to cut it up into smaller pieces to make it easier for them to consume.</p><h2>Degus </h2><p>Degus need timothy hay daily. Degus are prone to diabetes and cataracts, but they can live up to 10 years when provided with a proper diet and care.</p><h2>Pot-Bellied Pigs </h2><p>You may not have thought about pigs when you think about hay eaters but pot-bellied pigs can have alfalfa hay in their diets. The hay adds extra fiber to the formulated pellets, grass, and vegetables.</p><h2>Hamsters </h2><p>While hamsters are primarily seed and vegetable eaters, they enjoy grains, crickets, cooked chicken, mealworms, and even hay as treats. So if you want to spice up your hamster's eating life try adding a little hay to his food dish!</p><h2>Gerbils </h2><p>Gerbils eat a similar diet to that of a hamster. The treats they eat are also favorites of their rodent cousins. So why not find out if your gerbil likes a hay treat?</p><h2>Wallabies </h2><p>A wallaby looks like a small kangaroo and eats mainly grass but can also have timothy hay in unlimited amounts. Pellets, vegetables, supplements, and some fruits round out this down under pet's dietary needs.</p><h2>Patagonian Cavies </h2><p>You've probably never even heard of a Patagonian cavy, much less knew that they ate hay. A Patagonian cavy looks like a cross between a rabbit and a deer but is actually a distant relative of the guinea pig (cavy). Their diet should consist primarily of grass and timothy hay to keep them going strong for their 14 years of life.</p><h2>Llamas </h2><p>Llamas typically spend most of their days grazing on fresh grass in the pasture but hay is also an acceptable food to feed.</p><h2>Wallaroos </h2><p>Just like their cousins the wallabies, wallaroos consume a lot of grass and hay.</p><h2>Rats </h2><p>Many rodents will eat some hay, including pet rats. Rats have front teeth called incisors that continuously grow throughout their entire lives. Hay, along with other food that they are forced to grab and grind with their teeth, helps to keep these teeth at a reasonable length.</p>",616
141,https://www.thesprucepets.com/sneezing-hamsters-1238936,Small Pets > Gerbils,<h1>What to Do About Sneezing Hamsters</h1>,"<h1>What to Do About Sneezing Hamsters</h1><p>You may think your hamster just has a tickle in his nose which is causing him to sneeze, but could it be a sign of something bigger going on? Make sure you aren't causing your hamster's sneezing with something you are putting in his cage.</p><h2>Respiratory Infections </h2><p>Hamsters don't get the flu or a cold as we do, but they can get a respiratory tract infection. Upper respiratory tract infections can cause symptoms including runny eyes, crusty eyes that can seal shut, lethargy, a decrease in appetite, nasal drainage, and sneezing. These infections can turn into something bigger like pneumonia, but if treated right away are usually easy to cure. Bacteria from the environment or food or even another hamster can cause an infection that may make your hamster sneeze.</p><h2>Hamster's Allergies andSneezing </h2><p>Do you have allergies? Your hamster could have them too. While we don't go to the extent of allergy testing hamsters, we can treat the symptoms, suppress histamine release (with the use of antihistamines), and eliminate possible sources of allergens. Some hamsters may be allergic to certain types of scents such as the fabric softener you use to wash their fleece blankets or towels.</p><p>Some hamsters are allergic to the bedding in their cage, and others may find something in their food or treats that causes them to sneeze. Dust in the environment brings microscopic dust mites that your hamster can be allergic to as well. Try switching foods, washing bedding in unscented detergents and softeners and using a HEPA filter by your hamster's cage to eliminate the allergens in his environment that may be causing him to sneeze. If these symptoms are worse during drier times of the year, a humidifier may be helpful as well. If that still doesn't help, ask your exotics vet if you can give him an antihistamine.</p><h2>Respiratory Irritants </h2><p>Sometimes things in your hamster's environment can cause your hamster to sneeze because of the scent it gives off. Respiratory irritants can include perfumes, pine and cedar shavings, scented candles, electric ""plug-in"" style diffusers, and scented room sprays. Even some cleaning agents, such as carpet odor eliminator powders, can be irritating to your hamster's tiny, sensitive respiratory tract. If you use one or several of these possible respiratory irritants, it should be easy to stop using them around your hamster or move your hamster's cage from the source of the fumes. If you use pine or wood shavings, consider switching to towels or a recycled paper bedding material such as Carefresh.</p><h2>Other Reasons for Sneezing </h2><p>Less likely but still possible, your hamster could have a much more serious reason for his sneezing. Tumors in the head and nose can cause sneezing but aren't usually diagnosed, since most hamster owners are reluctant to have an MRI or CT done on their little rodent. If you see bloody nasal discharge, this could be an indicator of a serious disease process that is causing your hamster to sneeze.</p><p>If your hamster is acting abnormally in any way, seems lethargic, is eating less, not drinking, or sleeping most of the time, you should always consult with your exotics vet (find an exotics vet near you). Make an appointment to see if he needs antibiotics, antihistamines, or something else. Just because your hamster is a small pet doesn't mean there aren't some big things your veterinarian can't do for your hamster.

Certain types of cages are bad for guinea pigs because they don't provide enough space or may have other potentially harmful drawbacks. It's important to choose appropriate housing for your cavy!</p><h2>Aquariums </h2><p>Aquariums were once a common way to house guinea pigsand, unfortunately, they're still quite popular with people who don't research before buying a cavy.</p><p>At first, an aquarium might seem like a good choice because it's relatively cheap, solid (as long as you don't drop itsince it's made of glass), and easy to clean. Unfortunately, its solid sides mean the poor guinea pig inside doesn't get any air circulation.</p><p>Standard aquariums are also much too small for a single guinea pig. Cavies are social animals that do best when you keep two or more together, which means an even worse situation for the animals if you house multiples in an aquarium. Even though most guinea pigs enjoy being with other members of their species, they'll fight if their quarters are too small.</p><p>One last problem is the fact that the solid glass muffles sound in the aquarium. A guinea pig who gets used to that environment may be skittish if you take it out and it's suddenly bombarded by unmuffled noise.</p><h2>Pet Store Cages </h2><p>Pet stores sell a wide variety of cages labeled as being good for guinea pigs. Unfortunately, most don't meet the minimum recommended size of 7.5 square feet for one guinea pig and 7.5 to 10.5 square feet for a pair.</p><p>Beware of cages sold as ""starter homes,"" which usually means cheap and small. There are some larger cages, like the Living World Deluxe Extra Large Habitat, which is still below the ideal size but workable in a pinch.</p><p>Many commercial cages have ledges, but those don't count toward the square footage. They're handy spots for food, and hanging the water bottles over their shelves so it doesn't drip on their bedding, but it's not actual ""living space.""</p><p>If you decide to get a pet store cage for your guinea pig, you'll have to spend a lot of money to get one in a decent size. You might even need to get two and join them using things like tunnels. Just make sure attaching two cages together actually gives your guinea pig room to run rather than two small cages to go back and forth between.</p><h2>Cubes and Coroplast </h2><p>Cages made from storage cube grids and Coroplast, a type of corrugated plastic used in sign making, are the gold standard of guinea pig housing. They give piggies a lot of room to roam, and many people line them with felt instead of using conventional bedding for a softer surface and easier clean-up. The grids are kept together with standard connectors and reinforced with cable ties.</p><p>You'll need a lid for your C&C cage if you have other pets like cats. Wire shelves make excellent lids. If you don't have any potential predators in your home, your cage can have an open top.</p><p>Storage cube grids are readily available at big box stores, and sign shops usually sell corrugated plastic to consumers upon request, so you can make your own C&C cage quite cheaply.</p><h2>Other Homemade Cages </h2><p>Although using cubes and Coroplast is the easiest way to build your own cage, you can get creative and use other materials. For example, a child's swimming pool can make a great play space for guinea pigs as long as the sides are tall enough that they can't jump out.</p><p>People who can't find Coroplast sometimes make a cage from grids and use a shower curtain as the bottom liner. The specifics of your cage are limited only by your imagination, as long as the design is safe for guinea pigs.</p>",633

If you can't find the right cage for your pet rat, do it yourself with wire shelving and zip ties.</p><p>You may need to experiment a bit with shelf options. The instruction for this cage uses just one shelf, but you can make the cage as tall as you want with as many shelves as you want.</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3>Cut the Shelving </h3><p>Cut three of the shelves in half with the power saw, if the hardware store didn't do it already. You now have six lengths of shelving, each of which is three feet long. Each shelf piece has one long edge which is bent and one long flat edge.</p><h3>Assemble the Cage </h3><p>Turn the shelves on their ends, and then use the zip ties to join the long edges to form the main body of the cage. Use two pieces each for the front and back, and one piece for each side. Thebentsides of each shelf meet at the corners.</p><p>At the middle of the front and back, the flat sides of two shelves are joined. Initially, the sides of thecageare a bit unsteady as they can hinge, but this will be stabilized as the rest of the cage is assembled</p><p>Use your saw to cut the J-channel at a 45-degree angleto meet at the corners of the top of the cage. The cuts won't be perfect, but it will cover any cut ends of the shelving and give the top rim of the cage a finished look. It also clamps on tightly and stabilizes the front and back panel of the cage.</p><h3>Cut the Doors </h3><p>A standard door size for a rat cage is 9 inches tall by 5.5 inches wide. Cut doors from one of the remaining half shelves, making them slightly larger than the opening so that the door overlaps the opening a bit. Cut on the outside edge of the supports, so the door is a bit wider than the opening and make the door up to a couple of inches taller than the opening.</p><h3>Add the Doors to the Cage </h3><p>Line up the bottom edge of the door with the bottom of the door opening. The ""flat"" side of the door opposite the side where the support bars sit should face in, allowing the door to sit nice and flat against the cage, so there are no spaces.</p><p>Using several cable ties, attach the bottom wire of the door to the lower edge of the opening. You can also add a couple of metal clips in case your rats decide to chew off the zip ties.</p><p>The doors are latched with simple bolt snaps, like the clips often found at the end of dog leashes, which can usually be found at hardware stores.</p><h3>Make the Roof </h3><p>The other remaining three-foot length of shelving is used for the roof. Place it on top, with the bent edge facing up. Use several zip ties to hinge the roof to the back of the cage. Metal clips or hooks could also be used to fashion some roof lock for the front.</p><h3>Add the Shelves and Accessories </h3><p>The second level is made from a piece of shelving covered in plastic canvas. Cut a section of the shelving the same width as the cage. Attach the shelf using zip ties and then attach a piece of plastic canvas to the top of the shelf, also using zip ties.</p><p>You can place a bird ladder in the cage for your rats to climb to the second level or they can use the sides of the cage.</p><p>Place the cage on the under-bed storage container. Add food bowls, water bottles, toys, and bedding to complete your rat's new home.</p><p>The other remaining three-foot length of shelving is used for the roof.

Consider adding some soft bedding or blankets for them to nest in, as well as some toys and climbing structures to keep them entertained. You can also add a dust bath area by filling a shallow tray with dust specifically designed for rats. This will help keep their fur clean and healthy.</p><p>Overall, building a DIY cage for your pet rats is a fun and rewarding project that will give them a spacious and comfortable home. With a bit of planning and some basic tools, you can create the perfect cage for your furry friends.</p>",888
144,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-pet-squirrels-1239493,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Species,<h1>Feeding Pet Squirrels</h1>,"<h1>Feeding Pet Squirrels</h1><p>0</p><p>Squirrels are quick critters who need to eat throughout the day to maintain their energy levels and body weight. A varied diet is crucial in keeping them healthy but you also need to make sure you feed your pet the appropriate foods, not just any variety of foods.</p><h2>Legumes </h2><p>Squirrels can eat a variety of plants, including legumes. Peanuts are probably the most popular and widely loved legume, but they aren't the only ones you should be feeding your pet. Peas, lentils, and beans are all excellent sources of plant protein. You should aim to provide a few legumes in a squirrel's daily diet.</p><h2>Nuts </h2><p>Everybody knows squirrels like nuts. Walnuts, acorns, almonds, and other nuts are all loved by squirrels. They love to hold them in their tiny paws as they eat. Nuts are a great source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and even fiber for a pet squirrel. Provide a few nuts a day as treats to your pet squirrel.</p><h2>Seeds </h2><p>Seeds should be the bulk of your squirrel's daily diet. Pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, and other large seeds that are found in most parrot or squirrel mixes should be available to your pet squirrel. These will provide the bulk of their calories and nutritional content but should not be the only food you offer. Squirrels who live solely on seeds will lack calcium in their diet and will most likely become overweight.</p><h2>Vegetables </h2><p>After seeds, vegetables are the most important part of your squirrel's daily diet. Sweet potatoes and corn are popular choices and also very nutritious for your little pet. They provide key vitamins and minerals that seeds, nuts, and other foods don't offer your squirrel. A nice chunk of a vegetable will also give your squirrel a natural water source and add some variety to the diet.</p><h2>Fruits </h2><p>Handheld pieces of berries, melons, apples, and other fruits can be offered sparingly. Too much fruit will cause diarrhea. A little bit every day will give your pet a small number of natural sugars and carbohydrates that they need to balance out their diet.</p><h2>Insects </h2><p>While you may not like the idea of your little squirrel munching on a crunchy mealworm, your little rodent friend sure might! Squirrels will often enjoy the occasional mealworm or super worm, or may even jump at the chance to chase a cricket. Insects can be another way to add vitamins and minerals like calcium and vitamin D to your squirrel's diet. Moths are another option if your squirrel is adventurous and wants to jump and chase things.</p><h2>Formulated Pellets </h2><p>Some companies make squirrel pellets that are formulated to be balanced nutritionally for squirrels. Many Northern and Southern flying squirrel owners prefer to feed these pellets with some added nuts, seeds, and other foods to ensure they are providing a well-balanced diet. Parrot biscuits and monkey biscuits can also be fed as additional food but are not formulated to be the primary diet for pet squirrels.</p><h2>Supplements </h2><p>Many squirrels, especially flying squirrels, will need a calcium and vitamin D3 supplement if they don't get enough from the food they eat. In order to make sure your squirrel is getting enough calcium and vitamin D, you can dust fruits and vegetables with calcium powder made for reptiles a few times a week.</p><p>Pet squirrels will eat a variety of things but that doesn't mean you should let it eat whatever it wants. Nutritious cereals and crackers are popular treats with squirrel owners but sugary and salty snacks should be avoided. With all the options you have for feeding pet squirrels, you shouldn't have any trouble getting a variety of foods into your furry little friend.</p>",607

Both terms mean to remove the gonads or reproductive organs. Common terms for spaying or neutering are ""fixing"" or ""sterilizing.""</p><p>When a pot-bellied pig gets neutered your exotics vet will remove the testicles (a castration), the reproductive parts on a male animal. The scrotum will remain but will shrink up a bit over time in a pig that is neutered at a younger age. Veterinarians need to be careful to close the inguinal ring in males during surgery because they will often herniate therefore it is important to find a vet that is experienced with pot-bellied pigs.</p><p>When a female pot-bellied pig is spayed her uterus and ovaries are removed (a complete ovariohysterectomy). Some vets only remove the ovaries and this is called an ovariectomy. Larger, fatter pigs are more difficult to spay.</p><h2>When Should My Pot-Bellied Pig Get Fixed? </h2><p>Your exotics vet may have a personal preference as to how much your pig needs to weigh or how old he should be before getting him fixed but a basic guideline is to wait until he (or she) is at least eight weeks old but no older than twelve weeks of age. Since some pigs don't grow as large as others it may be hard to reach a specific desired weight that your vet wants before your pot-bellied pig becomes hormonal.</p><p>Females will go into their first heat cycle at about twelve weeks (three months) of age and will become sexually active at about five months of age. Most people will agree that you probably don't want a hormonal, bleeding, pot-bellied pig in your home so it is definitely recommended to get your female pig spayed before five months of age. Plus, an older and larger pig will have more fat in her abdomen making the surgery much more difficult for your exotics vet.</p><p>Males can start humping and ejaculating at an early age so most owners prefer to get their little boys neutered as soon as possible.</p><h2>Why Do It? </h2><p>All pet pot-bellied pigs should get fixed as soon as your exotics vet will perform the surgery for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Health reasons are the most important reasons to get your pig fixed. Males can develop testicular cancer, prostatic cancer, infection, and enlargement if they are not neutered and females can develop uterine, ovarian, and mammary cancer along with uterine infections, cystic ovaries, and other problems associated with the reproductive hormones and organs.</p><p>Behavioral reasons to fix your pig may be the most obvious reasons for pot-bellied pig owners. Males will hump, ejaculate, mark their territory with urine, and can become aggressive if they remain intact (not neutered). Female pot-bellied pigs will go into a heat cycle and blood will actively drip every month if not spayed. In addition to the bloodstains around your house, their hormones will cause them to be quite unhappy (similar to a woman who is PMSing). They will also urinate to spread their womanly scent with the world and will pee right in front of all their favorite people. Both sexes typically make much better pets with better personalities once they are fixed and are less likely to roam or run away in search of a mate.</p><p>Reproduction is a big reason to get your pig fixed as well. There are plenty of pot-bellied pigs that are in sanctuaries, rescue organizations, and shelters and the last thing anyone needs is a bunch of pot-bellied pigs without homes. Breeding pigs is a huge responsibility, a lot of work, mess, and something most people don't want to deal with.</p>",629
146,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchilla-cages-1236764,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Chinchilla Cages</h1>,"<h1>Chinchilla Cages</h1><p>0</p><p>Chinchillas are a small rodent native to South America, found in rocky, arid areas in the mountains. They are best known for their incredibly soft, thick, luxurious fur. In the wild, this fur protects them from the elements, but in captivity, it makes them somewhat susceptible to overheating. This must be considered when deciding where to place your chinchilla in the house. A cooler, quiet area of your home is the best place to put a chinchilla cage.</p><h2>The Cage </h2><p>The larger the cage, the better. The minimum floor space is about 24 by 24 inches, and a tall cage is best; if possible, get a tall cage with shelves and ladders that allow the chinchilla to climb. Wire is the best cage material, and avoid plastic cages or accessories and chinchillas chew and destroy plastic readily.</p><p>The tray can be lined with wood shavings (avoid cedar shavings, and hardwood shavings such as aspen are preferred over pine) or newspapers. Many chinchilla cages have a wire floor, which is nice for cleanliness but can be hard on chinchilla feet so are best avoided. Wire floors or shelves can be covered with wood to give the chinchilla's feet a break. A nest box, made of wood, should also be provided.</p><h2>Where to Put the Cage </h2><p>The cage should be placed in a quiet area of the home where human activities won't disturb (and stress) them during the day. The cage should also be located in a cool area (no drafts) and not exposed to direct sunlight which could cause overheating. Summertime temperatures must be monitored to make sure the ambient temperature is not much higher than 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius). If you do not have air conditioning, placing a shallow pan of ice cubes in the cage may help, or drape a damp towel over part of the cage.</p><p>Place the cage on a table or stand as this will help make the chinchilla feel secure; chinchillas can be intimidated if you must lean over the cage to interact with them.</p><h2>Water Bottles </h2><p>Glass water bottles are ideal because the chinchilla can't chew through them. If you use plastic, encasing it or creating a barrier to it with wire mesh should reduce the risk of damage (you can also get commercial chew guards). For feeders, hopper-style feeders that attach to the outside of the cage are nice because they can't be tipped and the chinchilla won't be able to urinate in their food. If a food bowl is used, it should be a heavy ceramic bowl to reduce tipping, and it must be cleaned daily.</p><h2>Toys </h2><p>Toys can be provided too blocks of wood and tree branches (free of pesticides) are good chew toys. Some of the wooden parrot toys make good toys as well, as do the willow balls and rings that you can find for rabbits. It is important to provide toys that do not have small or plastic parts that could be ingested. Also, a ""chinchilla block"" or pumice block can be provided for chewing and this will aid in keeping the teeth trim.</p><h2>Wheels </h2><p>Wheels can provide excellent exercise, although you may find that unless the chinchilla is introduced to the idea at a fairly young age it may not take to running on a wheel. Look for a 15-inch wheel (anything smaller will be too small for most adult chinchillas) with a solid running surface and an open side with no cross supports.</p><p>Some people also find the use of running discs such as the Flying Saucer a good option for chinchillas. The risks of overheating make the use of plastic run about balls undesirable. Your chinchilla would much rather run around in a secure, chinchilla-proofed room.</p>",615

Even though the BML diet is widely accepted and you can make it easily at home, new research on sugar glider nutrition has shown best outcomes for health in these species with a base diet of insectivore type food, mainly pellet form, supplemented with BML on the side and in moderation.</p><p>The BMLdiet for sugar gliders should not be used in conjunction with other formulated diets, such as Brisky's Sugar Glider food or Sunseed Sugar Glider Formula. It can be paired with insectivore based foods, though, and is recommended.</p><p>After preparing a batch of the BML diet, you will have a real meal time saver on your hands since this recipe will create ready-to-servecubes of food that you can feed toyour sugar glider each day.</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3>Mix Ingredients </h3><p>Blend the honey, egg, and apple juice in a blender until it is smooth.</p><h3>Add More Ingredients and Blend </h3><p>Turn off the blender and add the Gerber juice and the Rep-cal Herptivite Vitamin Supplement. Blend the mixture until it is smooth and then turn off the blender again.</p><h3>Add More Ingredients and Blend Again </h3><p>Add the Rep-cal Calcium Supplement ( buy from Amazon), the chicken baby food, wheat germ, and dry baby cereal. One last time, blend it until it is smooth.</p><h3>Fill Ice Cube Tray and Freeze </h3><p>Pour the mixture into regular size ice cube trays, filling each compartment only halfway. Then place the half-filled ice cube trays in the freezer.</p><h3>Allow to Cube to Melt Before Feeding </h3><p>Once the mixture is frozen, simply place one cube of the BML diet in your sugar glider's food dish a few hours earlier than feeding time (which is typically in the evening) to allow the cube to melt a bit. Remove it the following morning to avoid any food spoilage or attracting any unwanted insects.</p><p>The BML diet should be fed along with fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables at each meal. If you are using frozen food items then you can place them in the food dish at the same time as the frozen cube of BML diet to allow everything to thaw together. By the time your sugar glider is ready to eat, its food will be soft.</p><h2>Portion Size and Complete Meals </h2><p>A full ice cube equals about 2 tablespoons and the BML diet should be served in 1 tablespoon increments, along with 1 tablespoon fresh or frozen fruit and 1 tablespoon fresh or frozen vegetables each evening. This is why you only fill the ice cube tray compartments halfway with the BML diet when you are preparing it. Smaller ice cube trays that can be fully filled are also available if you'd prefer those.</p><p>Small snacks, such as mealworms, fresh fruit, or treats may be offered mid-day along with this diet if your sugar glider is extra hungry but the recipe for the BML diet itself should not be altered.</p><h2>Sugar Glider Dietary Needs </h2><p>Sugar gliders have very specific dietary requirements that keep them healthy and happy. A diet lacking in calcium and appropriate vitamins, for example, may contribute to your sugar glider developing metabolic bone disease (MBD), like reptiles commonly get, and make their legs more prone to fracturing. Diets lacking in honey or sugary nectar (which they eat regularly in the wild and are named after) do not provide enough energy for sugar gliders who need it for all the jumping and gliding that they do. They may not be as active, mentally stimulated, and strong without it.</p>",610

This care guide introduces you to everything you need to get the most enjoyment out of your pet rabbit!</p><h2>Is a Rabbit Right for You? </h2><p>The first thing to consider before you get a pet rabbit is that they have a long lifespan so be prepared to care for them long term. Rabbits are also unique creatures who form tight bonds with their families, but they also have some quirks you should know about. They require routine vet care from a good rabbit vet and are not low maintenance pets if you are doing things right. If you are prepared for all the unique qualities and needs of rabbits, you will be able to fully enjoy the wonderful companionship they can offer.</p><h2>Choosing a Healthy Rabbit </h2><p>A fairly quick look over at your potential pet rabbit will help you sort out if there are any obvious signs of illness or other issues. While there are no guarantees, avoiding rabbits that have common signs of health problems can save you a lot of heartache in the future. By having a close look at a rabbit you are considering, you also get a chance to see the personality of the rabbit.</p><p>Also, if you have decided to add a rabbit to the family, it is highly recommended you start out by looking at your local shelter or rabbit rescues. There are lots of rabbits who need a second chance at a forever home.</p><h2>Choose a Rabbit Cage </h2><p>Whether you decide to go with a hutch or cage, deciding on a home for your rabbit is extremely important. Cages that are spacious enough, easy to clean, and easy for your rabbit to get in and out of will make sharing your home with a rabbit so much better. A cage that is large enough is important for the well-being of your pet rabbit, but it is also no substitute for ample exercise and social time out of the cage. Bedding and litter are also important choices to make as cost and ease of clean-up will become your concerns over time.</p><h2>Feeding Pet Rabbits </h2><p>Even the best quality rabbit pellet is not adequate on its own as a diet for pet rabbits. Plenty of fresh grass hay is very important and required in a rabbit's diet, as are fresh greens and vegetables. The right diet is critical to keeping pet rabbits healthy. Get the scoop on feeding your rabbit a well balanced and high fiber diet.</p><h2>Toys for Rabbits </h2><p>Rabbits are playful, active, and curious, and they need a good variety of toys to keep them occupied (and out of trouble). Toys are also important to a rabbit's mental health and provide an opportunity for you to bond with your bunny.</p><h2>Rabbit Training and Behavior </h2><p>Rabbits are quite trainable, but it may take some patience, especially when it comes to litter training and redirecting very natural behaviors like chewing and digging. Spend some time learning how to understand what your rabbit is trying to tell you through its body languages and sounds,and rabbit-proofing your home, and you'll both be happier!</p><h2>Grooming Rabbits </h2><p>Grooming rabbits is important for all bunny owners to be familiar with. Find out why regular brushing is a must, bathing is out, and the low down on nail trims.</p><h2>Rabbit Health </h2><p>The health of your rabbit is very important, and your rabbit's veterinarian will play a large role in keeping your bunny healthy. Spaying or neutering, proper diet, exercise and enrichment, and regular check-ups are all vital to helping your rabbit live a long and healthy life.</p>",608

They weigh only four to five and a half ounces (80 to 160 grams).</p><h2>Origins </h2><p>Sugar gliders are native to Australia (theEastern part), Papua New Guinea, Tasmania, multiple surrounding islands,and parts of Indonesia. They are found in the rainforests gliding from tree to tree and make their homes in tree hollows. They rarely ever touch the ground.</p><h2>Anatomy </h2><p>Sugar gliders are marsupials which meansthe young are born very immature and grow in a pouch for 60 to 70 days on the mother's abdomen (like a kangaroo or opossum). Sugar gliders have furry, thin, stretchy, membranes that extend from their wrists to their ankles (the membrane is called a patagium) that allows them to glide up to 150 feet through the air. In the wild, they move from tree to tree by gliding, not flying. Their hind feet have a large, opposable big toe that helps them grip branches and the second and third toes form a grooming comb. Other toes help them grab insects and connect the patagium.</p><p>Large eyes are characteristic of these small marsupials which help them see while they glide and triangulate their launch and landing locations. It also helps them search for food since they are nocturnal and hunt at night.Both sexes also possess various scent glands, sharp teeth, and extremely soft fur.</p><h3>Watch Now: How are Sugar Gliders as Pets?</h3><h2>Temperament and Behavior </h2><p>Sugar gliders are very social and need companionship. This makes them bond well to their owners (especially if you use a bonding pouch) but even if you can provide a lotof attention and spend the necessary time with your glider, keeping a single glider is not ideal. Sugar gliders have a language all their own and live in colonies of up to 30 glidersin the wild. Housing a glider by themselves can lead to behavioral, mental, and emotional, and even physical problems for your pet. Strongly consider keeping more than one glider, if not several of them, in a flight cage. Humans cannot offer the same type of companionship and socialization that other sugar gliders can provide to each other. The vocalizations, grooming, and bonding that they provide for each other are irreplaceable by a human.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>In the wild, sugar gliders eat a variety of different foods depending on the season. They are omnivores and as pets, they are often fed specific diets that are recommended by experts and zoos. These are diets utilizing multiple foods but the base shold be an insectivore pellet, for rounded nutrition and it is great to help prevent dental disease. You can supplement this pellet with baby food, honey, fruits, vitamins, fresh items such as fruit, vegetables, and insects. Formulated, pre-packaged insectivore diets for sugar gliders do exist at pet stores and online and are utilized at zoos to provide nutrition for colonies of sugar gliders. The needs of sugar gliders have changed as more is learned about them.</p><h2>Health </h2><p>Sugar gliders, like other exotic pets, have a multitude of ailments that can affect them. Metabolic bone disease due to inappropriate nutrition, injuries from getting stuck and gliding, diarrhea from eating too much fruit, dental disease, and parasites are all commonly seen in pet sugar gliders.</p>",609

If you are purchasing anything other than the regular pot bellied pig, be sure the pigs are not just malnourished or underfed to achieve a desired weight and size. Some breeders will breed young pigs who aren't full grown to make it look like their ""adult"" parents are small since pot bellied pigs don't fully mature until they are 2-3 years of age. Most pot bellied pig experts say there is no healthy way to have a pig smaller than 50 lbs. and if you do have a small pig their lifespan will be greatly reduced to only a few years since their health has been compromised in the breeding process. Needless to say, there is much debate in the pig world on this topic.</p><p>Other names for different sizes of pigs exist but these are the most commonly seen varieties.</p><h3>Watch Now: Pet PigsCute Names and Fun Facts</h3><h2>Diet </h2><p>Pigs are very easily overfed. Many full grown pot bellied pigs (of all sizes) are obese simply dueto overeating. Although weight can vary from pig to pig, there are some key signs that your pig is overweight. For example, if a fat roll covers your pig's eyes then he is overweight. Your vet will help you decide what the ideal weight for your pig is based on his height and body condition.</p><p>As a basic rule of thumb, piglets can be fed regular pot bellied pig chow starting at 3 weeks of age (but you shouldn't be getting a piglet until they are at least 6 weeks of age). 2 cups of pig chow is a good starting point but you should be adjusting this amount if your pig is too fat or too thin. Most people recommend free feeding throughout the day but others still prefer the two meals a day method.</p><p>25% percent of your pig's total diet can consist of vegetables (limit the starchy veggies) and fruit should only be offered in very small quantities since it is high in natural sugars.</p><p>Remember tonot overfeed, do not feed chocolate or salty foods, do not feed fatty foods (especially animal fats), do not feed dog or cat food, don't offer food directly from the fridge (they will learn how to open it), and make your pig work for their food by putting it in a ball or pan with dirt to root in.</p><h2>Basic Care </h2><p>Pot bellied pigs are great pets for the right person but be sure to check with your local laws prior to acquiring one.</p>",601
151,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchillas-and-dust-baths-1238545,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Chinchilla Dust Baths</h1>,"<h1>Chinchilla Dust Baths</h1><p>A dust bath is a common self-grooming activity for chinchillas and other small pets like birds and degus. Taking regular dust baths is a natural behavior for these animals to keep their lush coats clean and healthy.</p><h3>What is a dust bath?</h3><p>Many species of mammals and birds take dust baths during which the animal rolls in dust or sand to absorb the oils and dirt from its skin. Dust baths also help to remove any parasites that may be living inside their fur or feathers.</p><p>Not only does adust bath help your chinchilla's fur stay smooth and silky, but it is also thought to be a relaxing and fun activity for your pet. Chinchillas really get into their baths, rolling and flipping in the dust with great enjoyment.</p><h2>Dust for Chinchilla Baths </h2><p>Always use store-bought chinchilla dust for bathing your chinchilla. This dust is specifically made for chinchillas and forthis purpose. When the chinchillas roll in this dust, it penetrates their coat down to the skin and absorbs oil and dirt from the fur which in turn keeps the coat clean. Other powders or sand may look or feel similar but they just won't work the same way. Chinchilla dust is made to mimic what they would have access to in their native habitat (in the wild they use volcanic pumice). The dust should be at least a couple of inches deep in whatever container you use so that the chinchilla can effectively roll in it.</p><h2>Chinchilla Dust Bath Bathtubs </h2><p>A heavy, tip-resistant bowl or deep dish can be used as a bathtub for your chinchilla's dust baths and it should be slightly larger than your chinchilla to allow room to roll. Glass fish bowls or canisters can be used and work well. Also, a plastic house-type container with a rounded bottom can be purchased at the pet store and are designed for this purpose.</p><p>Fish bowls and the plastic house-type baths have the advantage of being fairly enclosed, which can help minimize the amount of dust flying around the room. Sand will be thrown everywhere during the bath but this is just part of having a chinchilla. Using a covered bath can help, but your chinchilla will still shake and groom after a dust bath, resulting in a fine layer of dust on everything around your chinchilla. Invest in a good duster and remind yourself that you are being agood chinchilla ownerby providing regular baths. The remaining sand in the bathtub can be reused for a time, as long as any waste matter is removed.</p><h2>Chinchilla Dust BathSchedule </h2><p>The dust bath should only be made available to the chinchilla intermittently, rather than left in the cage indefinitely. Too much bathing can dry their skin out and if the dust is left in the cage, chinchillas will often sit in the bathtub and/or use it as a litter box. Offer the dust bath to your chinchilla at least twice a week in the evening when they are most active for about 10 to 15 minutes. Twice a week is usually sufficient, though you can offer the bath more often if your chinchilla's fur starts to look rough or feels damp or oily. In humid weather, baths should be offered more frequently. If your chinchilla has dry, flaky skin or seems itchy, decrease the bathing time and frequency.</p><p>Some owners provide the dust bath daily to their chinchillas. As long as their skin isn't too dry and you don't see them itching, this is fine. It will just make more mess for you to clean up, but chinchillas love taking baths so much that it may be hard to resist allowing them this pleasure.</p>",615
152,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rabbit-stop-digging-your-carpet-1239293,Small Pets > Pet Rabbits,<h1>How to Make Your Rabbit Stop Digging Your Carpet</h1>,"<h1>How to Make Your Rabbit Stop Digging Your Carpet</h1><p>Ifyou have a rabbit and carpeting, then you probably have a rabbit that digs in that carpeting. Digging is a very common behavior because it is also a very natural behavior for rabbits. In order to keep house rabbits from digging up your carpet and doing other destructive behaviors, you will need to give your rabbit something that is okay for her to dig (an alternative to the carpet) and teach your rabbit what is off-limits.</p><h2>Alternatives to Carpet </h2><p>Since your rabbit has a natural urge to dig make sure you provide something in which your rabbit is freely allowed to dig. Make your rabbit a digging box out of a large, fairly deep cardboard box (cut one side lower or make a hole to allow your rabbit to get into the box). Then add a thick layer of shredded paper, hay, or even chemical-free soil (this option will be messy though) in the box for digging. You can even hide a couple of toys or treats in the box for added interest. Smaller boxes or litter pans with shredded paper or hay can also be offered for additional digging opportunities. Untreated grass and sisal mats (these can be purchased in the pet store) are also great for satisfying your rabbit's urge to dig.</p><h2>Rabbit-Proof Your Home </h2><p>Protect places in your home where your rabbit likes to dig (wall corners and under doors seem to be attractive digging spots for many rabbits). You can put down plexiglass, plastic floor mats (like those for under office chairs), linoleum, floor tiles, heavy mats (like entrance mats), grass mats, or move furniture to cover or block areas your rabbit favors. If your rabbit wants to dig your furniture, cover it with heavy throws or blankets to protect it. Don't give your rabbit free run of your home at first until your rabbit is trained to not dig where he isn't allowed. Pick a limited area for your rabbit and thoroughly rabbit-proof that space to make training easier for you both.</p><h2>Supervise and Redirect Your Rabbit's Behaviors </h2><p>Your rabbit doesn't instinctively know that they are not allowed to dig on your floor or furniture so you must teach them. When you are starting out with a new rabbit, watch your rabbit carefully at playtime. Make sure you start this training as soon as you bring your rabbit home so no bad habits start early on. Whenever your rabbit tries to dig where they should not say ""no"" firmly but calmly, clap your hands (or stomp your foot on the ground) to get your bunny's attention, and then take your rabbit to their digging box to encourage the digging behavior in the appropriate place.</p><h2>Have Patience With Your Rabbit </h2><p>It will take time for your message to sink intoyour rabbit so be patient but consistent. Never hit your rabbit under any circumstance. If your rabbit keeps going back to your things instead of digging in her box, put them in a ""time-out"" in their cage for a few minutes. Another alternative is to use an exercise pen (they make them for rabbits and pocket pets) placed on a sheet of linoleum to protect your floor during at least part of the playtime outside of the cage. As your rabbit gets older and settles down digging should become less of an issue and you should be able to trust rabbit more. </p><h2>Spay or NeuterYour Rabbit </h2><p>Spaying or neutering rabbits helps make them less prone to destructive behaviors including digging and chewing. There are also behavioral and health benefits to getting your rabbit spayed or neutered.</p>",604
153,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinchillas-a2-1238558,Small Pets > Chinchillas,<h1>Chinchilla Care Guide</h1>,"<h1>Chinchilla Care Guide</h1><p>Chinchillas can make wonderful pets for the right person, but before deciding on a pet chinchilla, familiarize yourself with their unique characteristics and all aspects of their care.</p><h2>Is a Chinchilla the Right Pet for You?</h2><p>As lovely as chinchillas are, they are not the right pet for everyone. Find out about the unique characteristics of chinchillas, and their pros and cons as pets, to help decide whether a chinchilla is a right pet for you.</p><h2>Choose a Healthy Chinchilla </h2><p>Avoid taking home a chinchilla that shows common signs and symptoms of illness, stress, or other problems. While some health problems can be hidden, anybody can do a quick check for some common signs of illness or other problems. While there are no guarantees, avoiding chinchillas with obvious signs of problems gives you have the best chance of taking home a healthy chinchilla. Since many diseases are contagious, it is safest to also avoid chinchillas with cage mates that seem ill. As a bonus, you can also get clues about a chinchilla's temperament while doing a quick health check.</p><h2>Choose a Chinchilla Cage</h2><p>Being active animals, chinchillas need a large, roomy cage, ideally with multiple levels. It's best to have a cage set up and ready to go before you bring your chinchilla home to make the transition to your home that much easier. In addition to the cage, you will need accessories including a nest box, water bottle, dust bath, and some toys to chew.</p><h2>Feeding Chinchillas</h2><p>Chinchillas need a good-quality diet meant for chinchillas to stay healthy. Their digestive system is designed for foods very high in fiber, so a good high fiber diet and plenty of grass hay is the cornerstone of a good chinchilla diet. Feeding them an inappropriate diet can cause serious digestive upsets and health problems. Treats can be used with careful moderation; like some people, chinchillas have a sweet tooth and may prefer to eat things that aren't good for them.</p><h2>Dust Baths for Chinchillas</h2><p>It takes regular dust baths to keep your chinchilla's thick, soft fur in good condition. Chinchillas should never be bathed in water. The fine chinchilla dust provided for a dust bath penetrates the thickness of the chinchilla's fur and absorbs oils and clears away dirt. Not only do dust baths keep their fur in tip-top shape, but chinchillas also seem to enjoy having a vigorous dust bath.</p><h2>Taming and Handling Chinchillas </h2><p>It can take some time to get any chinchilla used to your hands and being handled, especially if they are older and haven't been handled much. Some chinchillas will never really like to be held much (they'd rather be exploring, or they may prefer to climb on you rather than being restrained), but being able to handle and interact with your chinchilla will make your relationship with your chinchilla extra rewarding.</p><h2>Toys for Chinchillas</h2><p>Chinchillas like to chew, run, jump, and hideout. These favorite activities can be kept in mind when choosing chinchilla toys. Providing a good variety of chew toys is not just fun for your chinchilla, it also helps keep their teeth in good conditions. Many chinchillas also enjoy a wheel, but it is extremely important to choose a safe wheel large enough for chinchillas.</p><h2>Keep Your Chinchilla Safe</h2><p>Chinchillas love to explore, but they are very curious and biting into objects to see if they are edible. The natural curiosity of chinchillas means that you should have a room that is thoroughly chinchilla-proofed before allowing time outside the cage, and close supervision is necessary. A handy checklist and tips about chinchilla-proofing can help keep your chinchilla safe. Also, consider other pets you may have in the home.</p>",601
154,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hamster-cheeks-1238908,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Hamster Cheek Pouches</h1>,"<h1>Hamster Cheek Pouches</h1><h2>Some Health Issues Can Impact Those Chubby Cheeks</h2><p>Hamsters have unique, stretchy cheeks that are used to store food and carry bedding. Syrian (golden) hamsters are often studied in research facilities for the unique characteristics of their cheek pouches. A hamster's cheeks are also a place where specific diseases can develop that owners should be aware of.</p><h2>Hamster Cheeks </h2><p>All hamsters have cheek pouches. These large pockets are evaginations of the oral mucosa and can stretch all the way back to a hamster's shoulders.</p><p>The primary purpose of the pouches is to carry food from place to place. In the wild, hamsters use their cheeks to bring food back to their burrows. This habit led to their name, which roughly translates to ""mister saddlebags"" in the local Arabic dialect where they are from.</p><p>Hamsters, like other animals, have two cheeks. Sometimes they stuff both of their cheeks and other times they only stuff one side with food. It is normal for hamsters to carry their food around or back to their beds via their cheeks. They will often continue to eat, even after filling their cheek pouches. Females may even carry or hide their babies in their cheek pouches.</p><h2>Hamster Cheek Diseases </h2><p>Overall, hamster cheeks are arguably the cutest parts of a hamster. A hamster with full cheeks makes you want to grin and cuddle up with your tiny, fluffy, friend. However, this part of the hamster's body is susceptible to a few health concerns. By being aware of the potential problems, you can prevent many future issues with your pet hamster.</p><h2>Abscesses </h2><p>Cheek pouch abscesses are commonly seen in pet hamsters. These are localized infections that cause pus to build up in the cheek pouch and can spread to the rest of the body quite quickly.</p><p>This is often treated by an exotic animal vet with antibiotics and sometimes a good cleaning of the cheek pouch. Without treatment, the infection will become painful, causing your hamster to stop eating, and the infection may spread to the rest of the mouth and eventually the bloodstream.</p> <h2>Tumors </h2><p>Cheek pouch tumors are another common problem in pet hamsters. Tumors are typically cancerous and usually only affect one of the pouches. They can infiltrate the entire cheek pouch tissue which stretches all the way back to their shoulders.</p><p>Pouch tumors are typically firm and have a different feel than a pouch filled with food. These tumors (usually squamous cell carcinomas) give your hamster a poor prognosis and are difficult, if not impossible, to completely remove while still allowing your hamster to eat normally.</p><h2>Eversion </h2><p>Cheek pouch eversion is very rare but it does occur. Eversion is when the cheek pouch flips out of the mouth. You will see a pink bulge in the corner of the mouth, and your hamster may have difficulty eating.</p><p>Your exotics vet will be able to replace the cheek pouch, but it may need to be stitched back into place if it keeps popping out.</p><h2>Impactions </h2><p>Cheek pouch impactions are another rare problem but it is seen on occasion nonetheless. Sometimes large pieces of food and bedding are shoved into your little hamster's cheek pouch, and your hamster can't get them out. If an impaction isn't cleaned out, it can get infected or abscessed when the food or food particles start rotting in the pouch.</p><p>Typically hamsters have no problem moving food in and out of their mouths. However, you should be aware of this issue if your hamster has a large pouch for an extended period of time.</p>",594

They are social, keep a daytime schedule, and rarely bite, even when they are stressed. Guinea pigs do need a large cage and opportunities to exercise and play outside of the cage, as well as a diet that provides adequate vitamin C and roughage.</p><h2>Introduction to Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Guinea pigs live, on average, 6 to 8 years, weigh about two to three pounds, come in a variety of colors, are very social, and make great pets for children and adults alike. Learn some facts about guinea pigs and what you need to consider before choosing a guinea pig as a pet.</p><h2>Guinea Pig Breeds </h2><p>Did you know there is a hairless variety of guinea pig? There are actually about a dozen different breeds of guinea pigs like texels, coronets, Baldwins, and more, all of which can be categorized by their hair (or lack thereof).</p><h2>Cages </h2><p>Guinea pigs need a lot more room to run around than most people provide them with. Large cages can be purchased online or in a pet store, or a custom enclosure can be created using small fencing or pens to give your cavy plenty of space to run around safely. But even if you have a large cage, do not forget that your guinea pig will love some time to roam about freely.</p><h2>Bedding for Guinea Pigs </h2><p>Guinea pigs use the bathroom wherever they please so you will need bedding that is absorbent but does not harm your pet. Wood shavings used to be popular, but more information on how they can harm pets has been discovered over the years, especially cedar shavings. Popular choices include fleece, which can be purchased from a craft store and then washed and reused when it gets dirty, and various kinds of paper-based small animal bedding.</p><h2>Feeding </h2><p>Vitamin C is the key ingredient in a guinea pig diet. Like humans and capybaras, guinea pigs cannot make their own supply of vitamin C to meet their daily needs, so it must be supplied for them. Guinea pig-safe vitamin C supplements and special guinea pig pellet food are fortified to help meet this nutritional requirement. Also, guinea pigs need a large amount of roughage, such as timothy hay. Stay away from sugary treats and seeds because they can cause gastrointestinal issues.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Should you bathe your guinea pig? How do you trim guinea pig nails? It's important to learn how to groom your guinea pig and what shampoo you can safely use on your cavy. Don't worry, you don't need to brush your guinea pig's teeth but you do need to pay close attention to them. Guinea pigs' teeth grow continuously throughout their lives and can become overgrown due to a variety of reasons. Overgrown teeth can cause your guinea pig a lot of pain and they may stop eating. Their teeth can be trimmed or removed, but hopefully, your guinea pig will never need either procedure.</p><h2>Guinea Pig Names </h2><p>Some people find naming their pets incredibly difficult. Thankfully there is a huge list available if you need a little help in this department. Find that perfect name for your new guinea pig or check to see if your pig's name made the list.</p>",594
156,https://www.thesprucepets.com/about-guinea-pigs-1238899,Small Pets > Guinea Pigs,<h1>What to Know Before Getting a Pet Guinea Pig</h1>,"<h1>What to Know Before Getting a Pet Guinea Pig</h1><p>Guinea pigs can be lovely pets, but there are a few things you should know before making that big commitment. From the expected lifespan to the social nature of guinea pigs, here are some things to consider before choosing a guinea pig as a pet.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs Are a Long-Term Commitment </h2><p>While a guinea pig doesn't live nearly as long as a cat or dog, they're still a large time commitment. Guinea pigs live on average around five to seven years, sometimes longer, so be prepared to provide care over the long term.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs Are Social </h2><p>Guinea pigs are very social animals and are at their happiest living with other guinea pigs. Keep a same-sex pair to ensure you don't have any unwanted litters. Females can be kept together, as can males without any issues. Be aware that sometimes personality differences in the animals will mean certain guinea pigs won't get along. Introducing them as babies is the best way to get a pair to bond, though even adults can usually be introduced with care.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs Need a Large Cage </h2><p>Guinea pigs need a lot of floor space, and most cages marketed as guinea pig cages are much too small, especially for a pair. Making a homemade cage is very easy, though, and since guinea pigs are a good size and not escape artists, a homemade cage is a great option.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs Are Quiet, Sometimes </h2><p>Guinea pigs make a distinctive wheeking or whistling type sound, often in anticipation of getting a favorite treat or when in need of some attention. Though generally not loud enough to annoy the neighbors, a wheeking guinea pig can be surprisingly loud. If you're looking for an animal whose vocals will never interrupt a dinner party or afternoon nap, a guinea pig might not be for you.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs Are Generally Easy to Tame </h2><p>While guinea pigs may be nervous or skittish at first, with consistent gentle handling, they usually become tame very easily. Careful handling is a must, and children should be supervised with them, but they are unlikely to bite even when stressed.</p><h2>Guinea Pig Require Vitamin C </h2><p>Guinea pigs are one of the few animals (humans are another) that cannot manufacture their own vitamin C, so they need to get it from their diet. Choosing a good quality diet and providing a variety of fresh foods and roughage is important, but most owners choose to also give their animals a vitamin C supplement. Vitamin C tablets are considered a better way to supplement than adding vitamin C to your pet's water.</p><h2>Guinea Pigs are Often Available at Shelters </h2><p>Before heading out to buy a guinea pig, check with your local shelters or rescues for guinea pigs in need of a new home. Many guinea pigs end up at shelters and are in need of a second chance at a forever home. Shelter guinea pigs are generally social and easy-going. It should be easy to bond with an older guinea pig.</p><p>Guinea pigs grow to be from 1 to 3 pounds at maturity. They're about 5 inches tall.</p><p>If your guinea pigis purring, it means she is happy! Good job, pet parent!</p><p>These little guys don't need to be bathed too often because they generally groom themselves. If there's a need to bathe yours, do it in a warm room, with guinea pig shampoo, in a basin in your kitchen sink or bathtub. Wet your guinea pig, gently shampoo, and rinse in warm water. Towel dry and keep your pet away from drafts till it's fully dry.</p>",595
157,https://www.thesprucepets.com/incomplete-sheds-in-reptiles-1239394,Small Pets > Exotic Pets > Exotic Pet Care,<h1>Preventing Incomplete Shedding Problems in Reptiles</h1>,"<h1>Preventing Incomplete Shedding Problems in Reptiles</h1><h2>Preventing Shedding Problems Is Usually a Matter of Good Husbandry</h2><p>There are many problems that can contribute to shedding problems or incomplete sheds, but the most common problem in inadequate humidity levels. Other factors include skin infections, injuries to the skin (including old scars), parasites, malnutrition, and inadequate heating or lighting. For this reason, if incomplete shedding is a problem, it is a good idea to consult with a reptile veterinarian to rule out medical causes. It is always important to make sure you are providing adequate humidity levels to prevent shedding problems, but remember that too much humidity can cause other problems. Find out the ideal humidity for whatever species you are keeping, and get a hygrometer to make sure you are keeping the humidity in the proper range for your reptile. As well, make sure you are providing proper temperature ranges, lighting (e.g. quality UVB lamps for species that need them), and an ideal diet.</p><h2>Shedding Problems in Snakes </h2><p> Snakes generally shed their skins in a complete sheet, starting at the nose and working down to the tail (their skin comes off a bit like a sock being turned inside out as it is removed). When there are problems with shedding, the shed skin is not complete and the skin comes off in patches (and in some areas the skin may not come off at all). Retained eye caps, where the protective scale that covers the eye is not shed with the skin, may also be a problem.</p><p>For a snake having problems with shedding, you can try soaking the snake in a tub of warm water a few times a day. Make sure the water covers the body but is not too deep or your snake may drown, and supervise your snake during the soak. Wrapping your snake in warm wet towels may also work as the friction from the towels as your snake moves around may help remove the skin; some keepers place snakes with shedding difficulties in a wet cloth bag (such a pillowcase) for a few hours. Providing a humidity hide is also a good way to give a shedding snake access to a higher humidity area. For arboreal snakes, try regularly misting.</p><h2>Shedding Problems in Lizards </h2><p>Lizards usually shed their skin in patches, but problems can occur when parts of the skin do not come off during the shed. This can especially be a problem around toes, the tail, and the base of dorsal spines (e.g in iguanas). In these areas, skin that does not come off can dry up and constrict around the toes, tail or spines, and can cause loss of these appendages. Shedding is usually completed within a week or two, and sometimes sheds occur one on top of the other, so sometimes it can be hard to tell whether a shed is progressing normally or not. Generally, all the skin should be shed within a couple of weeks once shedding has begun.</p><p>For lizards with shedding problems, treatment is much the same as for snakes. Providing a warm soak a few times a day can help. A humidity hide can also be very helpful for some lizards, such as leopard geckos; for others, such as water dragons, try regular misting. Again, make sure the enclosure is kept in the ideal humidity range for the species you are keeping. Bits of skin around the toes, dorsal spines and tail tips may need to be gently massaged off, but be especially careful with the tail as some lizards will just drop their tails as a defense.</p>",599
158,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-treat-abscesses-in-hamsters-5095733,Small Pets > Hamsters,<h1>Abscesses in Hamsters</h1>,"<h1>Abscesses in Hamsters</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p></p><p>Hamsters are fairly low-maintenance pets when it comes to health concerns, but that doesn't mean they aren't prone to certain problems. Abscesses are one such problem that hamster owners may need to address. These infections occur in wounds from minor accidents or fights with other hamsters, and they can be life-threatening without treatment. Knowing how to recognize abscesses and administer first aid can help you keep your hamster healthy.</p><h2>What Are Abscesses? </h2><p>Abscesses are pockets of infection that form at the site of an injury. They are generally filled with pus, which is fluid composed of white blood cells, blood, and bacteria. These pockets swell to form lumps that are tender to the touch. Abscesses are most often found under hamsters' skin but can occur internally, on organs, in a cheek pouch, or the mouth.</p><h2>Symptoms of Abscesses in Hamsters </h2> <h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Food in the cheek pouches can look similar to an abscess but an abscess will not decrease in size as a cheek pouch will when the food inside it is removed or consumed.</p><p>If an abscess ruptures, pus and blood may be seen on the fur in the surrounding area. This may also have a very foul smell due to the bacteria that is present. Hamsters are usually fastidious cleaners but the amount of infected fluid an abscess can produce may not be easily cleaned up or may be unreachable if it is on the hamster's neck or head.</p><p>Finally, if an abscess causes systemic infection in a hamster, lethargy and a decrease in appetite are likely to occur.</p><h2>Causes of Abscesses </h2><p>Pet hamsters develop abscesses when bacteria cause infection at the location of an injury.</p><h2>Diagnosing Abscesses in Hamsters </h2><p>To differentiate an abscess from a tumor, it's necessary to find out what is inside the lump. Your veterinarian may feel the lump and suspect it is an abscess. The first step may be to carefully lance the lump using a scalpel blade. If pus drains out, then it will be obvious it is not a tumor. To definitively diagnose it, though, the contents must be analyzed.</p><p>A sample of the abscess may be withdrawn with a syringe and observed under a microscope for bacteria so that a targeted antibiotic treatment plan can be established.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>A hamster's abscess must first be drained. Your veterinarian may have already done this as part of the diagnostic process. The abscess will then need to be flushed with a saline solution or other antibacterial agents. Antibiotics will be prescribed for you to administer at home.</p><h2>Prognosis for Hamsters with Abscesses </h2><p>When caught and treated promptly, abscesses usually heal quickly, and hamsters regain their health. If, however, the infection has spread or entered the hamster's bloodstream, the prognosis is poor. Antibiotics may not be able to stop the infection, and the hamster may die.</p><h2>How to Prevent Abscesses in Hamsters </h2><p>A bite wound is one of the most common causes of a hamster abscess. To prevent fighting, house your hamster alone. Most hamster species are best kept as single rather than multiple pets anyway.</p><p>Another thing you can do to help prevent abscesses is to ensure there are no sharp edges in its cage. Wire cages may have sharp spots on the corners and doors. Ladders, wheels, and other toys in the cage can also be problematic. Check these things regularly to help keep your hamster safe.</p>",557
159,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-do-mice-eat-4588704,Small Pets > Pet Mice,<h1>What Do Mice Eat?</h1>,"<h1>What Do Mice Eat?</h1><p>A lot of people associate mice with eating cheese, but we know that for optimal health, their diet should contain much more than this. Mice are omnivores, so they need a variety of different nutrients in their food. By giving your pet mouse a proper diet, you'll be helping it live a long and healthy life.</p><h2>General Mouse Food Guidelines </h2><p>It is common to find mouse food also advertised as feed for other pet rodents including rats, hamsters, and gerbils. These rodents all have similar dietary requirements, but not all of them are ideal for a mouse.</p><p>Minimal dietary requirements are not the same as optimal dietary needs, so what is recommended for a laboratory mouse is most likely not what a pet mouse needs - 20% of a mouse's diet should be fruits and vegetables while 75% should be fortified pellets.</p><p>There is, unfortunately, little research that has been done on feeding a mouse for longevity and not just short-lived research purposes. Mice are typically recommended to receive about 2 grams of potassium, 3 grams of phosphorus, 5 grams of calcium, 0.5 grams of sodium, 35 milligrams of iron, 10 milligrams of manganese, and a variety of other vitamins and minerals per kilogram of food.</p><p>Seed mixes are routinely sold and used to feed mice, but a mouse will typically pick out its favorite items and not eat everything it should. These mixtures often have pellets or blocks and dried fruits and vegetables in them, but because the seeds are more appealing and tasty to a mouse, they'll avoid the things they should be eating and only eat what they want. This is why seed mixtures are not recommended for pet mice. Seeds should only be offered as a treat.</p><p>Fresh, clean water should also be provided to a mouse at all times. The fruits and vegetables will offer some hydration but a water bowl and/or bottle should also be available.</p><h2>How Much and When to Feed Your Pet Mouse </h2><p>Many mouse owners will simply fill a bowl with mouse food and refill it as necessary, but this is not ideal. A small bowl or plate with fresh food should instead be offered daily. Each day the uneaten food, especially the fresh fruits and vegetables, should be discarded to prevent your mouse from consuming spoiled food. A few large blocks or a small handful of pellets should be ample food for daily consumption of one mouse, in addition to a small amount of fruit and vegetable pieces. Allow your mouse to have some variety and rotate what types of fresh foods it eats. An occasional treat of cereal, seeds, or crackers are okay to offer, especially if you are trying to hand tame your mouse. Only about 5% of your mouse's diet should be treat-based.</p><p>Caloric intake requirements will vary greatly depending on your mouse's genetics and activity level as well as the food you feed. If your mouse is pregnant, nursing, or still growing, the food requirements will also likely increase.</p><h2>What Shouldn't Mice Eat? </h2><p>Despite the fact that mice may willingly eat something, there are foods that are not ideal for a mouse to consume. Foods high in fat and sugar such as candy, cookies, peanut butter, chocolate, and bacon may be popular with your pet mouse but are very bad for them. Some people will offer very small amounts of cooked pasta or bread, but cheese isn't usually a favorite food among mice, despite the popular belief.</p>",584

That's why a rabbit that suddenly stops eating is a big concern. It may not seem like a big deal if your dog, cat, or other pet skips a meal, but if a rabbit does, it may be an indication of an emergency situation. While this definitely warrants a trip to the vet, there are a few things you can do in the meantime to possibly help your bunny feel better.</p><h2>Why Do Rabbits Stop Eating? </h2><p>The most common reason for a loss of appetite in rabbits is a gastrointestinal problem called ileus. Ileus occurs when normal peristalsis the contractions in the intestines that push food through the gastrointestinal tract decreases or stops. Ileus is extremely dangerous in rabbits and can cause death if left untreated.</p> <p>When your rabbit leaves its food untouched, it's obviously a sign that it has lost its appetite. In other cases, however, the changes may be subtler.</p><h2>Home Remedies </h2><p>In the absence of obvious signs of ileus, consider first any environmental changes you may have made that might cause stress in your rabbit. Correct these by reversing whatever you changed; then see if your rabbit will eat a treat or some food.</p><p>You can try home remedies in the first few hours after you notice that your rabbit stopped eating. However, rabbits that don't eat for even just a day are in a life-threatening situation and require immediate veterinary attention. Don't delay and, even while you're trying home remedies, give your vet a call for a phone consultation.</p><h2>Veterinary Treatment </h2><p>To immediately get something into your rabbit's system, your vet may recommend IV fluids or another form of hydration. Medications for pain, gas production, gastric motility, and other concerns may also be prescribed. Force-feeding your bunny with veterinary-grade products, such as Oxbow Critical Care or Emerald Intensive Care Herbivore, will provide the nutrition your pet needs while it isn't eating normally.</p><h2>Diagnostic Processes </h2><p>At the same time, your vet will want to figure out why your rabbit stopped eating in the first place. Sometimes this isn't easy to do, and there are several tests for diagnosing the cause (or causes). Along with a thorough physical exam, your vet may recommend a dental examination, blood tests, urine tests, fecal tests, radiology (X-rays), and other diagnostics.</p><p>There may also be times when testing may be limited or isn't practical, either due to the poor health of your rabbit or financial constraints. In these cases, the symptoms can be treated aggressively with fluids and medication but, depending on the root cause, the fasting may return.</p><h2>How to Prevent a Loss of Appetite </h2><p>Many diseases that cause your rabbit to stop eating are completely preventable through good care. For instance, overgrown or abscessed teeth (and the diseases they may cause) can often be prevented by providing regular dental care. Likewise, keeping your rabbit's cage clean can go a long way toward preventing infections and parasitic infestations.</p><p>You can also take simple steps to promote a healthy appetite in your rabbit. Make sure you provide unlimited grass hays (not alfalfa), leafy greens, and fresh drinking water in a bowl.Your rabbit also needs a stable environment that's free of fluctuating temperatures and stressors.</p>",555

Chinchillas, like some other exotic pets, have the type of teeth that grow continuously throughout their lives. These teeth may periodically require tooth trims if your chinchilla doesn't wear them down themselves.</p><h2>HypsodontDentition </h2><p>Herbivores such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and chinchillas have long teeth that continuously grow, often requiring tooth trims. These teeth, called hypsodont teeth, have crowns (the part of the teeth you can see) that extend a great length beyond the gums. Hypsodont teeth are unusually long when compared to the teeth of dogs, cats, or humans. The natural grinding action of chewing on toys, hay, and other food items causes the teeth to stay at an ideal length in normal herbivores, but many need to have their teeth manually cut on a regular basis due to health and genetic factors.</p><h2>Overgrown Chinchilla Teeth </h2><p>The incisors, or front teeth, of your chinchilla, are the easiest to identify when they become overgrown. They will usually grow so long that they begin to curve and stick out between the lips. Once they get too long, they can become stuck on things, or worse, grow into the gums or roof of your chinchilla's mouth. The molars, or teeth in the back of the mouth, can also reach excessive lengths. Molars are difficult to observe without the use of a speculum to look in the back of the mouth, but chinchillas with overgrown molars will commonly hypersalivate and have difficulty chewing and swallowing.</p><h2>Incisor Tooth Trims </h2><p>If done correctly, tooth trims are not painful. There are two common methods used to trim incisors. The first is by using regular dog nail trimmers to cut the teeth like you would a toenail but with this method, there is a high risk of cracking or splitting the teeth because of the force needed to use the clippers. This method can cause pain if the tooth is split up to the nerve or is trimmed too short.</p><p>The second method is by using a handheld rotary tool, like the Dremel, with a cut-off wheel to slice off the excess tooth. This method causes no trauma to the tooth. The only concerns are for trauma to the gums or lips if the wheel accidentally grazes them, or if the tooth is trimmed too short. Many exotic pet hospitals will perform these tooth trims inexpensively with a technician or a doctor but it should be done with anesthesia.</p><h2>Molar Tooth Trims </h2><p>Trimming molars can be more difficult than trimming incisors. Molars are not as easily identified as being overgrown, so the pet is usually already being seen by a veterinarian by this point. After the veterinarian confirms that the molars are too long, he will recommend anesthesia to properly trim and file the teeth. With your chinchilla temporarily incapacitated, a dental bur and handheld dental files are used. This is the ideal method of trimming molars, but owners may have financial constraints that restrict them from anesthetizing or sedating their exotic pets.</p><p>Owners of chinchillas and other exotic pets with hypsodont teeth must be aware of the possible complications regarding their pet's teeth. Without proper attention, overgrown teeth can cause serious trauma or anorexia. Thankfully the problem of overgrown teeth can be managed with regular tooth trims or solved by extracting the problem tooth or teeth. If you need help with your chinchilla's teeth, give your local exotics vet a call.</p>",586
